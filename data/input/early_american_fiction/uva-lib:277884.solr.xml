      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. A CHAPTER I. My sister...Caroline's grave...Hezekiah ruined...Mourning and sorrow...Moral obligation of the discharged debtor, examined... Judge Marshal..Hammond..Anecdotes of him...Vanity..Quere, if Digression would not have been a good title for this novel? One year; one whole year hath passed away, since I finished the last chapter. This very evening completes it. And even yet, my hand trembles, in taking up the story again. I feel like one, who, having grown old in sorrow and loneliness, is about to enter again, for the first time, since the death of a beloved one,—the apartment where she died.—How shall I bear it?—Is there, do you believe, upon the wide earth, a man of my age, so utterly desolate, as I, at this moment? I do not believe that there is. I have loved, and been beloved, truly and tenderly; very passionately too; and devoutly, at times;—been blessed, beyond the lot of other men—with the wife of my heart, and the babe of my strength, beautiful as day, and good, as beautiful—but where are they? Man, man! of what avail is all thy sorrowing and humiliation!—thy penitence and contrition? The curse of thy boyhood pursues thee! the shadow of thy transgressions; and, where the good man beholds but the visiting of God's own hand, in gentleness and love, the wicked quake under it, as beneath the unsparing retribution of one, that hath power, and will not be appeased. Merciful Father! do thou sustain us. Wean our young hearts, at an early hour, we pray thee, from all that the affections cling to, so desperately;—for, O, it is awful, to be widowed in our old age,—to nurse our children, into beauty and blossom, and see them lie dead before us!—to watch, many and many a night, by our dear one,—and yet outlive her! to see her sweet eyes quenched;—her lips turned to stone, and her smooth, living hair, dead—utterly dead—and harsh to the distracted pressure of our mouth! One whole year!—and even yet, I am dreading to touch the canvass again. It is coming, too, immediately, in contact with mortality. It is—O, I know not what; but I would avoid it—and will. Can you have the heart to forbid my wandering awhile. May I not tell the tale, without name?---one name, at least---in my bereavement? Well, well---after that---I was very sick for a long while; I was at home, when I came to myself---not at the home where I was born; but Elizabeth was with me, and that made the place a home, to me:---and, when I came entirely to my strength, I believe that my character was greatly altered. —I was less imperious of manner; and, perhaps, more humble and lowly of spirit. Elizabeth was constantly with me; and her sweet, unaffected piety wore upon me, before I knew it. And Hammond too; he knelt down at my bed side; and there was something of a grander character in his worship. His was emphatically religion—hers, piety. He visited us continually; and, it was a long time, before I rightly understood on what footing. My sister had determined not to marry;—and when I looked into her beautiful heart, and saw all its harmonious proportion;— at her delicate frame, so exquisitely wrought;—and thought of her affectionate temper and vivid genius, I could not but believe, that she had done wisely. Where was the man worthy of her, who might not, if he were great enough to deserve her, in some moment of perilous enterprize, put himself at hazard, in a contention with some spectre of glory!---and that, I knew, would kill her;—or, if he were only, like herself, some one of patient bearing, in life, to whom the sweet ministering of woman was potent, as the incantation of them that make the very fountains of the earth boil up---the ocean rumble---the fire and lava beat through their secret channels, like blood in the arteries of men---how would she wear away her life with him, ambitions as she was? ---in solitude?---darkness? and silence? O, no---that were an idle and unworthy death. No---there was no choice left; and, when I had her near to me, it was strangely delightful to think of her, as of one, that was to be mine, and mine alone, for ever and ever! I would catch her to my heart, and kiss her, till the blood was ready to burst through her pale forehead. At last, I had the strength to speak of what had passed---to go to the grave of---of—yes. I will write it,---of Caroline;---and to pluck up a few blades of the scented grass, that grew there. It was a wintry and desolate spot. The sea beach was near; and, at the spring tide, her grave was drenched with salt spray; yet, the flowers would spring up; and the sweet violet, would watch an opportunity, and peep out, for a moment, at the peril of being torn away by the watching blast. I went to the cottage. That too was desolate. The father was in his grave. Of a broken heart, he had died, if ever an old man died of one, in this world. I saw his wife again---she, who had well nigh been my mother. Her heart cried out wildly---at the sight of me;---and she fell upon my neck, and there, even there, I vowed inwardly, never to part with her more;---and I never did---but she left me---for the only place that she was fitted for; the society of the just, made perfect.--- Yes---of a broken heart, the old man died. His last hope was a law suit. Again and again, had he expected a favourable issue; any issue, indeed, would have been less fatal to him. At last, the day of trial came---but it went by. Another came---his counsel were ready, and the old man's heart beat high, with the hope of dying less abject, by a very little, than he had once apprehended. He was ready; agitated; and moved even to tears; his witnesses with him. But---there was some formality; some unknown privilege; to the other party, that could not be explained to him,---which prevented the trial again.---He could not understand it. It was the death blow to his confidence in man. The lawyers had drained him of his last dollar---under one pretence and another;---and now---it was just what his wife had long foretold him, there was to be no return to him, of the money that had gone, whatever happened; and then, in the imbecility of his piteously shattered understanding, he began to view it as a judgment upon him; for even so had it been called by the “Society,” for having set their laws at naught, and gone, unwarily, into litigation. “He came home,” said Eunice. “I met him at the door. That night, he never opened his mouth. I dreaded to mention the name of business to him. I did'nt ask him one word, about the law suit; but I feared the worst! He took to his bed. He never held up his head, again—he never spoke a word, after the first greeting to me, when he entered the door; and, in three days, we buried him. “Can this be righteous?” said I. “Speak to me, Hammond. You are a lawyer. Is it not a cruel and hard hearted profession? Do ye not profit of misery and crime?” “We do. But do not physicians and surgeons. Would you destroy them, too? I believe that a litigous spirit grows out of ignorance, rather than knowledge. But this poor man owed his death, not to the lawyers, but to the law.” “How?” “Under a sense, and a mistaken one, of moral obligation,” was the reply. “I do not understand you. Do you speak of his debts?” “Yes. He thought them all paid; but they were not; are not, to this hour. Dormant claims were constantly arising; and creditors, who had no legal right to molest him, fastened, like blood hounds upon his conscience; and tore and lacerated his old heart, as if it were a pleasant thing to torture one, that had been so powerful. I had more than one conversation with him, before his death; and, had he been as sound of understanding then, as he was once, I could have lightened his heart, entirely, of the chief oppression that it felt.” “What was it?” “He laboured under a sense of moral obligation, that crushed him. He had persuaded himself, that, although set free by the law, he was morally bound to pay every man whom he owed—that he might sleep quietly in his grave.” vol. ii. A 2 “I pray you, Hammond; remember that I am not a lawyer. I do not understand your legal subtleties; your artificial reasoning. But I ask you a plain question. Is it your belief, that a man may be discharged from the moral obligation of a debt, under any circumstances, until it be paid?” “I answer you, William, plainly, no. The debt must be paid; the contract performed, or there is for ever a moral obligation remaining. But we are arguing too abstractly. Let us take a familiar case, one that will bring the question to an immediate issue. You have an insolvent law in this state. A man contracts under it to pay another, a sum of money. He becomes insolvent; is discharged, in due course of law. Now, you would ask, if he be not under a moral obligation to pay that debt, whenever he is able.” “Precisely—that is just what I mean.” “I answer—no. I say that he is not. You appear surprised. If the law were in existence, at the time when the contract was entered into; and he had been discharged under that same law, then there is no moral obligation left upon him.” “But suppose that the law was not in existence, when the contract was entered into; yet, that, before it was completed, a law had been passed, and the debtor, duly discharged under it; then there is a moral obligation remaining.” “I do not rightly comprehend you, Hammond.—Do you mean to say, that the law has any thing to do with this moral obligation? They are two different things, are they not?—legal and moral obligations?” “To answer you that question, intelligibly. I must ask you, what the nature of a contract in this state, is, under the insolvent law. Suppose that A contracts with B, to pay him one thousand dollars, in sixty days—is A to pay him absolutely, come what will?” “Certainly—there can be no doubt of it.” “You are hasty, my friend. These are questions not to be so readily decided. Is A to pay, in case of his death?” “Certainly; if he leave sufficient property for the purpose.” `Very well. Then you, yourself, have already made a qualified contract of what, in terms, is an absolute one. By your own admission, the agreement is no longer, to pay one thousand dollars in sixty days, happen what will; but to pay that sum, in that time, unless he die; and then, if there should be property enough.—Reflect, a moment. Where do you find that law? It exists no where. It is only a matter of rational construction; any other doctrine would leave the conscience, of an honest man, burdened for ever, in the next world, as well as in this, with his unpaid debts.” “Now, what is the true contract in your state of Maryland, when a man enters into one like this. Is it to pay one thousand dollars, at all events? No. What is it? It is to pay one thousand dollars, if he can—when he can —or, produce a discharge under the insolvent law; leaving certain of his subsequent acquisitions liable for the debt; provided that the creditor shall take the proper, legal steps, in season, to establish his claim.” “That is the real contract, is it not?” “No. It is not. Judge Marshall has declared that the law is unconstitutional; and that, therefore, it cannot be made a part of the contract.” “In the first place, my dear friend, to speak reverently of that decision, as becomes me—it is a series of blundering, from beginning to end. In the next place —I do not doubt that a state insolvent law is constitutional; and, in the third place. I do maintain, in defiance of all that the supreme court have chosen to say then, in their folly; and since, in confirmation of it, that, even if the state law were not constitutional, it would still make a part of all contracts entered into under it.”[1] [1] An argument, of which the above is the substance, was written by a friend of mine, and published in the Baltimore Telegraph, the moment that Judge Marshall's decision was known in that city; and before it had been published or reported. It was, in fact, a severe but very just criticism, on that unaccountable judgment; and was received by the mob of lawyers, just as the writer might have expected;—and just as natural reason always will be received, by men, who, like the followers of Aristotle—in all matters, whether of law, religion, or metaphysicks, combat with words, rather than ideas— it was received as a very presumptuous, and impertinent affair. Yet I have lived to hear a part of the same doctrines, publickly and privately maintained by William Pinkney, himself—(since the criticism appeared in the papers;) and a part sustained in the New York Courts, by the same process of reasoning;—a part repeated in the report of Judge Marshall's decision, which had not been published, when my friend wrote his criticism; and he had neither heard the argument, nor received any intimation, whatever, of its nature; and not only that, but I have lived to hear all that remained of Judge Marshall's celebrated opinion in that case, justified, by a declaration from one of the bench; that they were influenced, in going all lengths, at the time—the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States!—by a hope of forcing Congress to pass a national bankrupt law; and that, having found the project to be a vain one, they are now continually seeking to evade, and escape from, their own decision, by every legal subtlety, refinement and pretence. Be it so: but it would be more manful, to my notion, if they would reconsider their judgment; acknowledge their transgression; and repent, like men, and like Judges; and not sneak out of the consequences of their own solemn opinion—while the opinion, itself, stands, on record against them, an everlasting reproach, to their wisdom and honesty. “But Judge Marshall says no. First, he says, that it makes no difference at all, whether the law be anterior, or subsequent to the contract.” “There never was a more mischievous doctrine: and, I believe, never a more untenable one. The law passed after the contract, could, by no possibility, have been in the contemplation of the parties, at the time when the contract was entered into. But that, which was passed before, might have been. That cannot be denied.” “Now, it will be only necessary to show that it was; and Judge Marshall, himself, would admit that it would make a part of the contract.” “It will not be denied by any man in his right senses, that A, in the case named, might have stipulated expressly, instead of promising as he did, to pay absolutely—that he would pay one thousand dollars, in such a time; or produce a discharge:—that is, it will not be denied that, the law, as it stands, whether constitutional or not, might have been incorporated into the contract, itself, by writing; and that, then it would have made a part of it.” “Suppose that it had. Would there have been any moral obligation in A, to pay the debt, after he was discharged, except out of certain subsequent acquisitions; named in the certificate of discharge.—No. All that an honest man can be called upon to do; all, that his conscience requires of him to do, is, what he contracted to do. What is the contract here. It is in the alternative. It is not to pay absolutely; but to pay, or to do something else; of course, if he do that something else, he is released from payment. It is just as if one should agree to pay a thousand dollars, or make a conveyance, at a certain time; and there would be just as much of a moral obligation in the latter case, to pay, after he had made the conveyance, as in the former, to pay after he was discharged.” “Yes—but that, lawyer Hammond, you will admit, would depend upon a written contract, into which the law itself, was formally and substantially, if not literally incorporated “And beside—” said Elizabeth. “Hush! one at a time, if you please,” said Hammond, very earnestly, but smiling. “I shall now attempt to show you, that it would make no difference, whether the law be written or implied; whether it be expressed, or understood, in the contract; if it be the usage, and the belief of the trade—the common law; or the lex loci.— It is now too late to introduce the statute law into all our contracts. People are obliged to know the law.” “Not when it is not law; when it is not constitutional, I suppose,” said Elizabeth, pleasantly. “Understand me. It would be lawful, undeniably, for two individuals to incorporate this unconstitutional law, into their contract. Now, if you can make it appear, that the law was understood and meant by them, to be a part of the contract at the time, just as if it were inserted, word for word, in black and white; the law, or rather equity, will establish it, on the ground of mistake: usage of trade, and general opinion will have again their weight.” “But how can that be done?” said I,—“How will you make it appear?—Few men really know the law.” “There are several ways—first, by making it probable. Ask any merchant, if he would have refused, for any other reason than, because of the trouble that it would have given him, to incorporate the law itself into his note of hand? the law of endorsement, for example, or discharge—or notice.” “He will tell you, no.—And why should he have refused? He knew that the law, whatever it was, governed his contract, as effectually, as if it were written therein. But there is another way. File a Bill of Discovery; and compel the creditor to answer, on oath, as to his best knowledge, and belief of the law, at the time of contracting; and as to his intention.—Yet both of these grounds may fail. But we have another in reserve, that cannot fail. A man may plead ignorance of the law; may swear that he did not know of its existence; or deny that he would have admitted it, into the terms of the contract, for any consideration, (and such a man would not expressly include the statute of limitation, on one of his notes, I dare say.) Yet, it is always enough for your purpose, if he have entered into the contract, in the regular course of business; if he have sold his goods, or charged his labour, at a fair market price.” “Why?---because profit is but another name for insurance, premium. He, who insures, is bound to know the course of trade; the usage and the risk; and, it is his own folly, if he do not demand a sufficient premium, for his indemnification. It were as ridiculous, therefore, for a man that has sold goods to another, to allege, that he did not know of the state insolvent law; as, after he had put his name to a policy, to declare, that he did not know the perils of the voyage. In both cases, he has received a fair and faithful consideration, in his own stipulated profit; or in the regular market price.” “Does he complain of this? Does he complain that he is not paid? that he only knew a part of the risk? You see that I have supposed the worst possible case, for my doctrine. Yet he is paid, whether he know it or not. Who establishes the price? Are they ignorant men? It is their own folly. But are they so, in reality? No. They are sober, calculating men; who take into view, all contingences; the risk of failure, as of shipwreck, fire and hurricane. He, therefore, who sells at the same profit with them, receives the same premium; and is paid, though he may not know it, for the risk that he runs.” “Shall the insurer be permitted to come to you, after you have publickly entered into an agreement with him, and he has lost; and demand to be set free from his contract, because he did not know what he was about, when he made it; or, on the ground that he has not been paid? Shall he tell you, that there is a moral obligation on you, to refund? You would laugh in his face.” “And why not laugh in the face of that man, who comes to you, after you have been discharged, under the insolvent law, and asks you to pay for goods, which you bought of him, at a market price; and tells you of your moral obligation to him? The cases are precisely parallel.” “But you forget;” said I—thinking that I had him, sure enough. “He is not paid at all. He has sold his goods on a credit.” “Nor, is the insurer actually paid. Both receive notes, and take the risk of payment.” “Perhaps,” said Elizabeth, timidly, “there may be something to justify this doctrine, in the difference of prices that we see, in different cities. In Boston—I have heard, I think, that there is no insolvent law, there —goods are much cheaper, I am told, than here.” The eyes of Hammond streamed fire. “Thank you,” said he; “thank you, Miss Adams. That had escaped me. It is very true. Nay---the difference of price in every city, will prove the same thing. No matter how honest a man is, he will sell his goods to one person, at a less price, on a credit than to another-- thereby, proving, what I say; that the profit which he charges, is the premium for the risk.” “Thus, I think, that I have shown first---that though the state law were unconstitutional; still, if it made, expressly, a part of the contract, it would have governed or qualified it. And, secondly, that it matters not, whether it be constitutional or not; inserted in the body of each separate contract, or not; still, if the contract have been made in the usual course of trade; in a state, where the law was supposed to be in force; that even then, the law was a part of the contract.” “I confess, that my opinion is a good deal changed, upon the subject,” said I, “I had never reflected on it before. I had always a notion in my mind that there was only one way of paying a debt; and that, by money; but I now see that there are such things as alternative obligations; and, indeed, little else than alternative obligations—contracts, that are qualified in a thousand ways, though apparently absolute, upon their face.” Hammond smiled—“upon my word,” said he, “you fall, very naturally, into our technical phraseology. You understand it, I hope.” “I hope that I do,” said I, a little piqued. “Well, well, don't be angry.” “But, you were somewhat bold, for a young man—I think—my friend,” said Elizabeth, “just now.” I have waited to hear you through; and I confess, that I find you quite intelligible. I allude to your manner of speaking about Judge Marshall. He is a great and good man, Mr. Hammond.” “Indeed he is!” answered Hammond, with enthusiasm, “and that is the reason, why I reprobate such absurdity as this. Do you think that I would speak as I do of it, were it the blundering of a common man?— No. But hear me. You think me arrogant. I am not. I am only bold and honest. I never say these things, however sudden and rash they appear, without having first weighed and considered them well.” “Judge Marshall says that it matters not whether the contract be made before, or after the statute. I have already shown you that it may make all the difference in the world; and that, it does make it, in the cases named: that, if the law were made after the contract was entered into, the law could not, by any possibility, have been in the contemplation of the parties; but that if the law were made before the contract, it not only might have been, under their contemplation; but, unless excepted in the contract, must have made a part of it, if the contract were in the usual course of trade.” “He says too, that it matters not, whether the contract be entered into between the citizens of different states; or of the same state.” “There he is wrong again. The difference is broad and manifest. Let each state act within her own jurisdiction, upon the contracts of her own citizens; and of them only; and there will then be no jarring or conflict, with her neighbours. It is very right that she should not meddle nor interfere with a foreign or sister jurisdiction. Thus, if the debtor and creditor be both residents of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania state courts may settle the question. But if it be between a citizen of Pennsylvania, and one of New York, the only suitable authority is their common superiour, the United States Court. They both want an umpire. I say nothing of what is called the lex loci, the law of the place; for that is only a subject of general squabbling and doubt.” “Judge Marshall says too, that imprisonment makes no part of the contract. I shall not stop to quarrel with the language of the proposition. I will content myself, at present, with understanding it.” “Now, I undertake to say that he is mistaken, for I love to treat great men respectfully. It is a part of the contract, and a substantial part. It is what all parties expect; look to; and provide for; nay, it is that, which drives the debtor to payment, and gives power to the creditor. If it were not, why is any insolvent law necessary? If imprisonment were not a part of the contract, —where would be the necessity of pleading a discharge of the person, in any case—particularly as the stipulation or consent to imprisonment, does not appear, in terms, upon the contract? Nay—how dare a creditor imprison a man?—and why is he not instantly discharged on motion, after arrest, in every case?” “If Judge Marshall be right, the debtor would be so discharged;—and the creditor would be subject to an action for false imprisonment—nay, the very officer himself—and jailor.” “Yet—mark the reasoning of the court. They admit a power to be in each state, sufficient for protecting vol. ii. B the person of a debtor discharged within it, for ever.— Yet, they deny to it, the power of protecting his property.” “The distinction is ridiculous. I will undertake to show, at a suitable time, that—one of these two things is true:—either, that the individual states may protect property, and person, both;—or, that they cannot protect either. I hold myself answerable for this promise.— And I shall redeem it, one day or other, though uttered now, in conversation, without going to the feudal tenures, or magna carta; or, as the blockheads in court call it, magna charter.” “By this construction of the Supreme Court, each state is permitted to exercise a power, which has ever been; is; and ever will be, a source of jealousy and heart burning, throughout the whole confederacy. It makes certain of them, places of refuge, where a debtor, honest or dishonest, has but to touch the soil, and he is free. It permits one state to interfere, directly; and in terms; without the formality of any investigation, between the obligations of debtor and creditor, from another state. That is—by this construction, a man is permitted to run away from one state, where all his contracts have been made; and throw himself into the protection of another state, that he never saw, till hunted thither, by the avenger.” “But suppose that another construction were adopted. This is, to my view, a false and perilous interpretation; hastily given, and obstinately supported, merely for the purpose of evading, what could not be denied, that the states, in their individual capacity, may pass insolvent laws.” “The court admit that. But then, in seeking for the definition of an insolvent law, they, not aware of the mischief that they were doing, have denied, that a state may protect the property, in any case—and granted that it may protect the person, in every case.” “But—had they given a different construction, that for which I contend, to it, there would have been no such evil to apprehend; no conflicting of jurisdiction; no clashing of power; no refuge for villany; and there would be found sufficient analogy in other admitted powers, of the confederated and individual governments, to justify it.” “My construction is this:—that each state has the right to protect the property and person of her own citizens—against her own citizens;—but not the right to protect either the property or person, of even her own citizens, against the citizens of another state— and still less, the person or property of the citizens of another state, against other citizens of other states.” “She has nothing to do with them. She has no business to meddle with them. Let the parties go before their common tribunal, the lofty and impartial umpire—appointed by the constitution. I mean the United States Court—you smile—but, they are impartial, very impartial, where their own authority is not in question. And how could you expect them to be, where it is? Are they not men, with the infirmities of men? subject to the temptation of men? and to some others, perhaps, that mere men are not subject to—but only judges and lawyers.” “I am in earnest. But, I would qualify the construction that I have just given, by adding that, the law of the state, to operate righteously on its own citizens—should not effect existing contracts. Do you understand me?” “Perfectly,” I answered. “You mean to say, that if two men contract, when there is no insolvent law in existence, that a future law ought not to effect the contract.” “No—not exactly that. In my mind, there is no question, that such a law may pass, and operate, upon even existing contracts; but then, there will be always a moral obligation in the debtor, after he shall be discharged, to pay the debt, from which he has been discharged, by a law, passed subsequently to his contract. “Perhaps,” said Elizabeth, timidly, “perhaps I have not rightly comprehended you, Mr. Hammond. You will please to set me right, if I have not. This is a new; but, I hope, not an unprofitable discussion to me. I hear a great deal of complaint; and see a great deal of distress—and—but let us talk over that, at another time. At present, I have a thought, that there is either some fallacy, or some errour in your argument. Moral obligation, I take to be distinct from legal obligation. Is it so?” “It is. And that too, is it not? which the law will not lend its aid to enforce?” continued Elizabeth. “Yes.” “If then, your doctrine be sound, or construction, I believe you call it; would it not follow that no moral obligation is left, after the law has destroyed the contract. Pardon me. I have not expressed my own meaning. I am unused to argument; and there is some difficulty in using the proper language. You say that each state has a right, to pass an insolvent law, in certain cases. Do not the citizens know this? are they not bound to know it?” Hammond snorted, like a race-horse—protruded his bald head, half across the table, in astonishment; and his eyes dilated to twice their usual magnitude, while she continued. “And is it not, legally and by construction at least, if not in fact, in the contemplation of the parties, to a contract, when they enter into it, that the state may destroy it, or suspend it, in a certain way?” Upon my word!” said Hammond, after a silence, of at least ten minutes; “that is passing strange! For three years have I been meditating upon this very question— for three whole years!—and yet, that idea never entered into my head. Miss Adams, I thank you Unassisted good sense may do, what will amaze the profoundest, at times. You have driven me to higher entrenchments.” He arose, when he had said this; threw back his head, and trod, less like a dwarf, before her, than I had ever seen him. “Yes!—it is true. If my construction be right— and I feel assured that it is, there can be no moral obligation, even where the law was made after the contract.” “All that can be required of one is, to do what he has promised. My contract then, is not to pay one thousand dollars, at all events; but to pay it, unless the law set me free.” “It is like the case of endorsement. If an endorser be not notified, he is exonerated. Every man knows this; or is supposed to know it. It would be ridiculous for me, to tell the most conscientious moralist, after he had been exonerated from his endorsement, by the negligence of an endorsee, that there was, nevertheless, a moral obligation, on his part, to pay the debt.” “So, in the statute of limitation. The law maintains that there is a moral obligation to pay a debt, barred by the statute. I deny this. But, granting that there is—still, it does not affect my case. The construction of the courts, though not law in itself, is the evidence of what is law. People are bound to know what this construction is, just as much as if it were a part of the statute itself. And, therefore, where the construction of the courts is, that, a subsequent promise revives a debt, which is barred by the statute of limitation, infancy or insolvency; such a promise becomes a new and substantial agreement; and requires no moral obligation to give it force; except to evade the metaphysicks of law, respecting a nudum pactum; or a contract all on one side.” I was pleased, I confess—and the evening had worn away, in a manner, that I was little accustomed to; I felt a more inward and sustaining dignity—had a better opinion of man's nature; his prerogatives, and scope, and grandeur, than I had before. It was not possible, to hear Hammond converse on a subject, that roused him, without, notwithstanding his cold, haughty, arrogant denunciation of great men, without feeling as if you had stood upon the hills, and seen giants wrestling, and pitching the bar. Every movement of his intellect was so prompt, bold, and athletick. So pleased was I, indeed, that, after he had gone, I renewed the subject, with Elizabeth. “What do you think of him?” said I. “He is a very extraordinary man;” said Elizabeth. “But passionate, supercilious, and abrupt—is he not?” vol. ii. B 2 “Yes. But he has great command of himself; and his superciliousness, I observe, is never shown toward them, that the world think below him. To such, he is really humble, forbearing, and patient. Of his vanity, I hardly know what to say. He often startles me, with it; but less, I believe, from its abundance, than from its honesty. I watch other people; and I find them vain. But, it is not so easily detected in them. He is bold, and imprudent. I remember an instance. It is long ago;—a lady, of great good sense and observation, rebuked him, in a manner that delighted me, for it — But you shall see her; and judge of her, for yourself. She is a remarkable woman. The instance, of which I was speaking, was this.” “He had been highly wrought upon, where we were, and strangely eloquent. He never says fine things; but, it is difficult to forget anything that he has ever said, when he has been in earnest. The people, here, begin to treat him with great respect and consideration.— “Why,” said Mrs H—, to him, “why did that lady listen to you, so breathlessly?—and the others too— why was it?” “Because I astonished them,” said he, in his calm, natural way. “No—” she answered, smiling, at the oddity of his reply, and startled too, at his boldness—“perhaps not. You are a little loud, you know, in conversation.” I smiled. “No, pardon me, Madam,” said he, “not a little loud; I am very loud. You meant to tell me so; but, you were too polite. I know it. I have heard it, again and again. I have tried to learn wisdom, by reproof; but, I cannot. I am accustomed to it. It does not hurt me. I was well nigh running away with a woman—monster that I am, because she told me, in a lady like way, that I had been writing about what I did not understand—and that—I was a fool. You meant to tell me nearly the same thing. I am too loud. I am sorry for it; but I am so, without knowing it Will you be kind enough to check me—I shall understand no sign—no hint—but speak out, whatever it be, and I shall be grateful for it. I am called rude—rude!—because I shake off the poisonous dew, from every flower that I touch—before it has time to scorch its vitals. No, madam; you are not the first, whose temples have throbbed at the sound of my voice. One man, a very dear friend, has told me, that he could endure anything but my voice, in argument; another, that it was like a clarionet in his ears; another, a lady —after I had told her a long story, for the second time, which I knew that I had told her before; and, when I reproached her, for her forgetfulness, or complaisance —she told me, that she never understood half that I said—that my voice frightened her; and that, no stranger, or female, without nerves of cast iron, could endure it. No—madam—I thank you. I feel your good intention; and will reform. But do not despair; —when I have become quiet and meek—you laugh—I do not wonder at it—.” “Do not imagine that you are the first, that has reproved me; no—I remember something of the same kind, at this moment. I had been particularly fine; and the man, to whom I was talking, was, to my notion, the most respectful auditor that I had ever had—I stopped. He made no answer. His eyes were rivetted upon my breast. At last, he drew a long breath.” “Mighty powers,” he cried out, “what a play of langs!” And, on another occasion too, where I had been very eloquent and convincing—very—a sweet woman looked me up in the face—there was a dead silence.” “Pray,” said she, “had'nt you a deaf grandfather?” “The question puzzled me, exceedingly, for a while; and the company, I remember, laughed, heartily, at the time; but it was long before I understood the drift of it. She must have thought, by my voice, that I not only had a deaf grandfather, but that. I had been brought up, or raised with him; and that my deaf grandfather was in a fair way to have a deaf grand-daughter in law, if I should ever marry.” “Some other conversation passed; and, when he had gone, I asked Mr. H. what he thought of him,” continued Elizabeth. “The vainest creature in the world,” said she—“but then, his vanity is like the vanity of no other human being. He seems to boast without intending it; without even knowing it; and, all the while too, as if he honestly believed every word that he said.” “He does believe it, my dear Madam,” said I. “Nay, what is worse, I am afraid that we should find it hard to undeceive him.” “I am afraid so, too!” said she, leaving me. “Make what you can of him, Elizabeth. He is beyond my skill. They were astonished!—ha—ha—ha!—“Yes— I will be bound they were; such a noise would astonish anybody.” “I reflected on the matter, my good brother, after she had gone. “Another man,” said I, “would have talked, if he could, all the while; just as Hammond did; thereby, showing that he knew his own powers of entertainment; thereby proving, that he believed himself, to be worthy of engrossing all the conversation. Yet, he would never have owned it—never have said it. Hammond would. There is the difference between Hammond's vanity, and that of other men.” “She is right;” said I, to myself. “My sister is right.” Ed.</field>

Hammond is wounded...Surgeon...A poet...His character...Letter...Development of character...Sensibility to disgrace...Rebuke ...Reconciliation. The next day, Hammond led me out, through the borders of the city; and amused me with such a variety of information, anecdote, and wit, that I was seized with a strange, troubled, anxious admiration of him.— Where had he acquired it?—among men? No—he had been less among men, than I; though older, by two or three years. Where then?—by studying his own nature. I looked at him with amazement. Touch what theme I would, he had always something to say upon it, that was new, and worth repeating. I found too, that, what he said, was said, in a manner so peculiarly his own, so simple, so energetick! that I was able to repeat it, word for word, sometimes, though the same things, perhaps, would have made no impression upon me, had another said them; or, had I read them. His manner was often sudden, vehement—abrupt,—pleasant for a moment or two, but not longer—yet so indignant, vivid, burning and sarcastick, that I felt an unaccountable sense of his superiority oppressing me.— Go where he would, there seemed to be no thought of his ugliness, even in the boys. Every body saluted him, respectfully. But he had no companions, I observed, among the youthful. Two or three middle-aged men, and several aged ones, came out to meet him; and stood and held his hands, as if he had been one of them, while we went along. I felt like a boy in their presence. At last, we came to the woods---where the most beautiful stream in the world, goes, making a picture at every bend before you. “How happened it,” said I, while we stood looking at the water below us, which ran, smoothly and swiftly, in one part of the stream; and then broke out into quick, turbulent flashes---and bright sparkles, at another---that we pass by the countenance of Nature in her repose and tranquillity, as if we saw it not; and that, we are only startled into exclamation or delight, by meeting with it, when it is agitated or disturbed. It is that--- but you are about to speak---go on—.” “It is a part of human nature, William. Power is never felt or acknowledged, unless it be mischievous. A great and good man, who spends a whole life, in fulfilling every duty, and appointment of life; who is a father and a husband; a brother and a child; a citizen and a magistrate---who lives and dies in the scrupulous discharge of every amiable duty, to God and man--- how far is he known---by whom---and how? For a few miles---by a few people, and only as a good man? Few believe him to be a great man; --for, whatever may be his greatness, it has never been visible to them. No man ever was great in the management of his family, and relationship with society. To be great, he must have the power, at least, of being mischievous;— and even then, until he be mischievous, people cannot be certain of his power to be so. Look at that water; It is far deeper, more useful, and richer, with a greater multitude of fish, just there, where it is going, quietly and smoothly, on its way, reflecting you willow trees; and darkened by the shadow of that green bank---see! that where I point --how singular!---one cannot tell where the water touches the bank, so uniform is the deep green, and so vivid the reflection: but what I was about to say, is this---that we pass that part of the stream with careless insensiblity. Yet here, we stop, and lift up our hands in delight;---here, where the water appears to be spouting up, out of the broken rock, in a thousand bustling cascades---just as if Moses himself had been here---and smitten the solid granite---till it dissolved in water spouts---or gushed out, through a hundred shattered fissures, in brightness and smoke.--- Yet here there is no utility in it---it is only beauty. So with the human character. It is ruffled to light---nay, I once wrote half a dozen lines on the same subject---- perhaps I can repeat them.” The willow tree stood, with her tresses as bright, As airy and high, as a warriour-feather; Now bending in shade, and now stooping in light; While, we wandered abroad by the moon, together— Their braiding was dark, while the breezes were still: But brightened, whenever they over it played: So the broad and deep river—the smooth running rill Go silent and dark, in their channels, until They are ruffled to light. So our pulses are still, Till we flash through some path that convulsion hath made. The willow and water are emblems of life— We darken in peace; but we brighten in strife. “I do not remember the words exactly, but they are somewhat after that fashion. I wrote them hastily;— and am not often, as you know, foolish enough to repeat my own poetry.” It was very true. I had never heard Hammond repeat a line of it before; and I verily believe, that he did not remember twenty lines, of all that he had ever written. “So too, in the moral word,” continued Hammond. “Great virtues are, by the very law of their being, unobtrusive, calm and beneficent. Men see nothing, and hear nothing of them. Women fulfil their duties, with all the affectionate secrecy and silence of devotion, every day, in the world;—yet, what woman is taken notice of, while she performs only her duty? Look at the French Revolution? The women that became conspicuous then, during the reign of terrour, were not greater, in reality, than while they were nursing their children, or comforting their husbands; and watching over their household. Yet, till they were sprinkled with the blood of their dear ones—or, had became sanguinary participators in the revolution, they were unknown. So with politicians and writers. The arts of peace are beneficent and gentle. Those of war, tumultuous and confounding.” “Nay”—(after a pause—during which, he uncovered his bald head—and lifted up his large, full eyes to the sky, as if he were overheard there—and was not ashamed, nor afraid to be overheard there)—“even with God himself, it is altogether the same. We are not conscious of his presence, and power and greatness, at such a time as this, when all creation is actually sleeping under his outstretched hands. But anon, when he arises—and would rebuke us—when he shakes the skies; and the earth trembles; then do we cry out,—The Lord God of heaven and earth! The Lord God omnipotent!” There was one remarkable peculiarity in the countenance of this man, which I have omitted to mention, as it deserves. It was this. His eyes were very large; and, in general, very ugly; particularly, when he was deadly pale, as he was, for ever, when agitated or moved —and his rough hair was tumbled—and tossed all over his head,. But, when they were uplifted,—the large black balls—with a wide, glittering, white edge below them—they were, if not the most beautiful eyes, that I ever saw, the most awful and amazing. They had the faculty of dilitation and contraction, like those of the cat family, and the owl—such as I never saw, before, in any human eyes. It was not, that the pupil enlarged—but the pupil—iris—and ball—instantaneously, would grow to twice their usual size. At such a time too; and, hardly at any other, was there a certain unity of expression all over the face of Hammond; a vast harmony —his large white teeth, and red mouth---and broad nostrils were actually sublime. In looking at them, ugly as they individually were, all except the mouth, you would absolutely forget the character of each, in the wonderful expression of the whole. In fact, Hammond the Dwarf, was made to look up---everlastingly up---at the sky, or into the face of his Maker. When he communed with men; or with the creatures and things below him—his face was more that of a brute beast, than of a human creature—coarse, broad and sensual---to such a degree, that his chaste and expressive mouth, took the character of gloating sensuality ---low appetite—and even gluttony. There was at such a time too, no unity of expression in it. His eyes appeared to have no connexion with each other---no communication---and less, if possible, with the rest of his face,---while one was broad and open---the other was nearly shut---I have seen this many a time: and one, I have seen lighted up to a dazzling depth—while the other was cowering like a serpent's eye, among the coarse, abundant lashes. At the time that I speak of, however, there was none of that contradiction. And I actually shook with the noise of his heart; and felt my heart dying within me, when he stood up and shouted, with a solemn clear voice---which was returned to him from all the hills about---The Lord God of Heaven and earth! The Lord God omnipotent! It began to grow dark; and we were yet in the beautiful dim wood that skirted the hills about our city. “You will spend the evening with us,” said I— “Do you desire it?” “Yes—.” “You are cordial.” said he. “I accept your invitation. But---we are alone now. You know me. You have known me for some years. I want a friend. I have looked about me. I find few, that I would wish to be my friends—none, that I would take much trouble with, to make so. Don't interrupt me. I am weary of acquaintances. You hated me cordially, once. You hate me no longer. I would have you love me, as cordially. Three months from to-day, I shall offer you my hand. I do not ask you if you will take it. I leave you three months to think of it. It is no light matter, for men like us, to swear friendship. It must be done cautiously, deliberately; but once sworn, we are like brothers.” There was a peculiar emphasis in what he said; and, particularly in the word brothers. It startled me then, I remember; but, I paid less attention to it, at the time, than afterward. I offered him my hand. He put it back, proudly. “No,” said he “not yet, William Adams—not yet. Let us not be precipitate I want something to love; something that will love me—die for me. You are the man, I think. Women are out of the question. They vol. ii. C cannot love at all, as I would be loved—and if they could, God has forbidden it to me.” His voice trembled—. “I thought that you had such a friend,” said I. “Whom do you mean?” “Young W—.” “He!—he, a friend, such as I want. No—Do you know me? Do you know him? No, I am not to be flattered or made a fool of. I have no respect for boyish attachment. The friendship of boys, and the love of girls are not aliment for my stomach. I covet the affection of children, but not of grown children. Mr. W. is a young man of uncommon genius; but he wants nerve, fortitude, iron. Stop—let us go by my chambers, and I will show you what he is. On the way, I will tell you how our acquaintance began. It was one of his seeking. You know that I am a solitary fellow. The young men avoid me: and the old are afraid of me; and this very day, you have seen many men cross the street to speak to me; and stand before me; with their hats off—who, a few years ago, would have thought it presumption in me—to—.” We were now upon the pavement again; and were interrupted by a shriek; and saw a crowd gathered a little before us. I sprang forward—but was withheld by Hammond. “Stop!” said he. “Let us take our measures, before we get into the mob—that we may act in concert. We shall be separated there.” Just as he said this, a young woman leaned out of a window, that we were passing, to fasten the blinds. I stopped to admire her neck and shoulders. They were most beautifully turned; and there was a noble, patient loftiness in her look, that I never forgot afterward. I mention this, because it agitated me, at the time, and because —but no matter. Before we met again, an unaccountable notion beset me, that she was lame—and—. We soon found, that the uproar was caused by a brutal ruffian, a drayman, who, in the mere wantonness of his heart, had struck a young negro girl, a blow with his whip, that brought the blood through her thin clothes. It was actually oozing out, and trickling down to her feet, when we came in sight. My first impulse was to knock the scoundrel down. “Stop!”—said Hammond, imperatively. “Silence! —what is the meaning of all this?” All began to speak at once. “Have done!” he cried, leaping into the middle of the crowd, that gave away on all sides, some in terrour, and some in mockery—and facing the ruffian. The turbulent voices all died away. Every face was turned to his. The poor girl, who had been sobbing, as if she were cut to the bone, stopped, all at once;— and from the scornful, malignant scowling of the rascal, with the whip, I began to apprehend that I should soon be wanted in the aftray;---but no—he could not well stand in the rebuke of the Dwarf alone. Every look was upon Hammond. He had not moved his eyes from the face of the man, for nearly a minute. “How is this?” said he, at last. “Have you struck her?—are you not ashamed of it?” Instead of replying, the scoundrel raised his whip, and, for a moment, seemed to menace Hammond. He only smiled I should have cut his throat, upon the spot---but he only smiled. I waited the issue. The next moment, the whip resounded—like a pistol; and the poor girl leaped, upright, from the earth---as if she had been cut through the heart. I had raised my arm, and---but Hammond was already at work. I looked at him---he was black in the face. He stood holding upon the naked and brawny wrist of the other---who was struggling with him---and appeared searching for something, in his side pocket, at the same time. “Do not strike her again”---said Hammond---“do not. I would not have your blood upon my hands.” “I will, by God!”—cried the other, attempting it, violently, but in vain. “Begone!” cried Hammond—biting his lips—and knitting his brows—to the stupid girl—“Begone!” She shook, and obeyed him. The man wrenched away his hand, at last, and would have pursued her. “Another step!”—said Hammond, plucking at his arm. That other step was taken; and, ere you could have clapped your hands thrice, I heard the lash strike the limbs of Hammond; and saw him, with his teeth clenched—and the blood issuing from his nostrils, kneeling upon the breast of the other. Both were motionless.— The people retreated in consternation, and shrieked. I plucked Hammond from the fellow; but he had hardly life enough to stand up; and the blood was in a little puddle, on the earth where he ell. The man lay, in the street, like a dead body—his neckcloth torn—and twisted round, and round—and his eyes blood-shot— It was a case of life and death;—I had seen the blow,— with a whip too---and could I blame him! Hammond put his hand to his side---and my first thought was, that he had burst a blood vessel; but no--- he was only wounded. He had been stabbed in the scuffle. The man was taken up; and soon gave symptoms of life;---and Hammond sent for a carriage; took me into it, called upon the surgeon himself; and submitted to inspection on the spot. Such was his coolness, or insensibility, that he continued the conversation, in which we had been interrupted in the same tone, just as if nothing had happened---till the business was over. “What think you of it, Doctor?” said he. The Doctor shook his head. “Nonsense, Doctor. We know your profession.--- Law and physick are alike. We never shake our heads in bad cases. It is then our business to keep up the patient's heart. But in less serious matters, we shake our heads, so that we may have the more credit for our cures.” The Doctor laughed. “Do you think that there is any danger, Doctor--- any? you understand me” “Any,” said the surgeon, hesitating. “There is a—a —some danger, you know, in every wound—but, I— we can tell better, tomorrow. If there should be any inflammation—or—.” “My dear Neck or Nothing—leave me alone with the good man, a moment;” said Hammond. I started, at the old and well remembered name— and obeyed; and the surgeon told me, afterward, with the air of one that cannot rightly believe what he has just seen, with his own eyes, what passed between them. “Tell me,” said Hammond, “plainly; and without any shuffling, whether you would advise me, to be prepared for the worst? I feel that the wound is deep; deeper, perhaps, than you think. I know that there is one bad symptom—it does not bleed, outwardly—it is in a part, too, particularly subject to inflammation; and I could feel that your probe did not follow all the turns of the knife. My notion is, that I bent the blade, after it entered my body; for, he tried, more than once, be fore he could draw it out.” “Can you bear it?” said the surgeon. “Bear it!—bear what?” answered Hammond; his beautiful mouth curling—and nostrils dilating. “I can bear any thing. Am I to die?—immediately? do not fear to tell me so. There is no time to lose. Bear it—I!—why—what have I to frighten me?—A pure conscience? No—let me die. What have I to bind me to life?—No children—no wife—no beloved one;— a monster—a hideous and mis-shapen monster—no, no good doctor—tell me at once, what is my peril?” “I do not believe you to be in great danger;” was the cautious, uncomfortable reply; “but the knife has gone near, very near to a vital part; and, I am afraid, has wounded an artery. We shall do the best, that we can, for you. You shall have a bed in my house. I will go, immediately, for Doctor Jeffries—but, I would —I—it might be well, you know, to—to—to be prepared. Every prudent man will be prepared. There is no knowing what may happen.” “Well, well doctor. I shall go home, if I can. I thank you, nevertheless, for your offer—come in, William.” “I entered—helped him into a carriage; and we were soon at his own chamber; he, chatting, as unconcernedly, vol. ii. C 2 as if there were no apprehension within his heart. But I—I could not talk. And, when the consultation, which followed immediately, was over, I shed tears, in thankfulness to heaven that it was not a mortal wound. “I was saying,” said Hammond, as soon as they had gone—“that I could not brook acquaintances. I will have no friend, who cannot lock and rivet his heart to mine. I gave you three months, for a trial. It will be long enough, for us to understand each other, thoroughly; and then, if we both feel that we can embrace, like men; and stand up together, against misfortune and discouragement—it will be well for us. If not—let us then part, and never cross one another's path again.” “You spoke of Wallace. Take that key—the secretary there—open it.” I opened the cabinet, and took out a bundle of papers. “Yes—yes—that's the bundle—thank you.—This letter, I wrote to him a long time ago. Read it. It will give you a better notion of what I am; and of what my friendship is, than you can now have, of either. Nay—not just now. Read it, when you are at home. Meanwhile, let me tell you, as I promised, how we became acquainted;—but first, tell me what you saw, in that window, as we passed? Some angel, I suppose—they are very plenty, of late. Every square has a few of the breed. You colour. I have not hurt you, I hope. Was it any body that you know —and—and—why, what alarms you?” “I know not;” I answered, “I know that I have never seen her before; and yet, I feel as if I had—some where, I know not where.” “Her! whom?” “That woman. I cannot get her out of my mind.— I feel as if I had been acquainted with her, in my childhood—in another world—or as if I had seen her picture some where.—It is'nt as if I had seen her.” “Poh—nonsense. This dreaming is common with your inflammatory spirits. Every beautifully-faced, or proudly-walking woman; every timid and delicate innocent creature; and every superb one, is full of sentiment or magnificence, to the high in blood.” “And the high in heart;” said I. He turned, and smiled; and as he turned, he caught a view of his own countenance, in the mirror; it darkened. “A big head!—a big head!” said he, glancing at me. I understood him; it went to my heart; but, I had presence of mind enough to reply, in his own words, just as he had used them, years and years before—striking my breast, as I did so, just in his own impressive, strange manner. “Yea—and a big heart too!” He grasped my hands—the swarthy red of his bald forehead, vanished—vanished, like a shadow; his frown went off—but, he remained deeply affected, for a minute or two. “I thank you,” said he; “it is true. I have a big heart.” So he had. Had he not? He could not have said so, as he did, if he had not. “Some day or other, you may meet that woman again—” said he; “and then, you will remember these very sensations; and imagine that they were sympathetick and ominous! Was the woman beautiful?” “No,” I replied; “but wise, and lofty of heart, I am sure.” “Yes, yes, I dare say so. And, marry whom you will, dear Neck or Nothing—(I started again—I could'nt get reconciled to the name;) for marry somebody, you must, and will; and then, I shall give you up; this it is, that makes a woman of me, when I think of opening my heart to one that will not, cannot, in the nature of things abide, for ever, in it—it tempts me to forswear opening it at all. But, I was saying that, when you are married, no matter to whom, there will always be some such incident in your memory, to hallow your delusion—as if—I suppose these phenomena are common.” “No;” said I, seriously. “That neck and countenance—no matter—I cannot talk of her. I wish that I could forget her. I am poor and lonely; and I shall never meet her again.” Hammond smiled benevolently, compassionately, at first; and then, while I watched his face, it took a slow expression of pity, then of scorn—and then of bitterness. I felt my cheeks burn. “Your love must be valuable, and very permanent—” “It is” said I,—“My love is! My hatred is! My friendship is! Take your choice.” “I like your spirit—let us leave the subject. O, I remember. I had begun to tell you of Wallace—I will finish it now, if you please. My acquaintance began, three years ago—I was on a visit to a friend of mine. He had in his possession some work that I had written.” “An author too!” said I, with surprise. “Yes, an author,” continued Hammond, in the same tone. “He had shown it, or lent it to Mr. Wallace; and, expecting to see me, had told of it; and made a sort of promise to bring us together.” “There is a note,” said the man, handing a paper to me, with his strong countenance all illuminated, “in which you have some concern. The writer wants to know you. Read it, and tell me what you think of it.” “I read it. I was the subject of it. It had, evidently, been written for me to see. It was laboured and unnatural—no note at all. It was a piece of affected enthusiasm; full of powerful, but unmeaning words; without principle or feeling, or sincerity.” “I do not wish to know him,” said I, returning the note.” “He smiled, and told me the character of the man; that he was a poet, highly gifted, enthusiastick, but inexperienced” “Still, I felt no desire to be acquainted with him.— He was too much a man of the world, for me.—I did'nt much like being cajoled, so barefacedly.” “But, not long after, I happened to be in company, where the conversation fell upon the poets of the day; and his name was mentioned by a fine intelligent girl, who had known him from his very boyhood, without having understood him. She had rather a happy talent at description; and a quick sense of the ridiculous. She described him as “immeasurably” affected—“inordinately” vain—“superlatively” conceited, &amp;c.&amp;c. (using the same kind of disproportionate language, which you will hear, every day, from what are called smart women—whose vivacity and impertinence are mistaken for wit and talent;) and, finally, she gave us an imitation of him, in one of his best fits of abstraction, in a fashionable company, sitting apart, if you please, and talking, for half an hour together, in a plaintive voice, just loud enough to be overheard by the company—about poetry—melancholy—cold blue water— willow tresses washing themselves in the shadow, and moonlight—the emptiness of worldly enjoyment—and especially of sensual enjoyment—like some spirituality, looking with eyes of compassionate wonder, upon the coarsenses of all mortal appetite; and this, perhaps, with a glass of wine in one hand, and a lump of cake in the other—surrounded by ribbons, laces and chattering girls—and dressed in a suit of perfectly fashionable clothing, from head to foot—so arranged as to prove, that, whatever else he thought of, he did not forget the tailor.” “I listened to all that she said of him; and left her, wondering less at the follies, of which she had been speaking, in a man of genius; than at herself, a woman of fine judgment, and a good heart, for not discovering, in the very excess of his vanity and pretension, conclusive evidence of sensibility and genius—for sensibility and genius are inseparably combined; and always proportioned to each other. I determined to see him; and if it were not too late, to save him. I went out of my way, for the purpose; and prevailed upon him, at last, to comprehend that there was a time and a place for all things; and that superlative poetry, misapplied, would only be superlatively ridiculous. I taught him that the spirit of poetry was a holy thing,—a light, not to be shown idly;—an odour, and a flavour, not to be diffused, but in holy places, and on holy occasions;— a kind of enchantment, that, to be acknowledged by the multitude, should be withheld from their encroachment; enshrined and unapproachable, except to the pure of heart, and high of thought; to be touched irreverently even by the keeper himself, of it, only at the peril of blindness and confusion.” “I studied his character, I tell you, as no other man would ever have taken the trouble to study it. I found the elements of his mind in pitiable, but shining disorder. He was labouring under a moral derangement, which the world could not understand, and would, in time, mistake for intellectual derangement. He seemed to have no settled principles of action—no aim —no object, except an indefinite one, that kept continually shifting. He was ambitious, to be sure; but not for eminence, in any one particular thing. His ambition was rather a diseased appetite, for present notoriety, than the gallant longing of a great heart for an imperishable, and distant reputation. To his view, the present was immortality; and he was foolish enough, to believe, that the future must echo to the voice of the present. He was, emphatically, a man of genius— though not a man of talent;—but of such a genius, as I would not that a brother, or son of mine should have, for all the world.—It was a kingly shadow, with the shadow of regal habiliments, about it, which, when you approached them, fell off and faded into brilliant exhalation—like coloured ice; in the sunshine. Talent is substance. Genius is show. Talent is a primary quality of things, like weight—genius the secondary quality, like colour.” “Mr. Wallace I mean to say, was not conspicuous for talent, weight or substance of material; but he was for genius—fashion—shape—colour and beauty.” “He was incapable of reasoning, for five minutes together, with any thing like continuity of purpose; and was almost incapable of understanding a legitimate deduction. His colloquial powers were showy, and artificial; and his best conversation, at one time, although he improved somewhat, before I left him, was a perpetual digression. He never understood how to introduce a story, an illustration, or even a remark; but, let him say what he would, when he was in company, where he wished to shine, it always appeared premeditated; as if he had just been reading about it; and was determined to talk about it, before it was forgotten. Then too, he had tricks of forgetfulness, and abstraction, that every body could see through; bursts of enthusiasm, that all could perceive were counterfeit; little absences, and abruptnesses, which were evidently predetermined, to disguise a want of aptitude for conversation, under the appearance of originality, precipitation, and extreme thoughtfulness. He had no real sincerity of temper, and no true integrity of heart.— The fault was in his education. He was intended for a man of the world; and he sought to be something above the world. The consequence was, that he became neither the one thing nor the other. He had too much genius for the former; and too little good sense, for the later. His mind was a world of beautiful material, all in disorder—a mine of brilliant, but unvisited ore. He had far too little of natural grandeur—that awful and distinct something, which comforts and upholds great men, under all the dispensations of the world—too little of that heroick originality, which shows itself continually; and acts without study, or preparation; and far too much of that showy counterfeit, which common men employ themselves about, with indolent assiduity —troubled, impatient hearts, unsteady hands, and confused eyes. He was totally destitute of delicacy; and would flatter his best friend, most grossly, to his face; and that, not as if taken by surprise, or carried away by passionate enthusiasm; but, as if he thought it expected; or a part of good breeding; or, would produce a return cargo of like nastiness;—and, not unfrequently, so as to convince a keen observer, that it was done for the purpose of doing him—in the way of management. So too, he would bear flattery in turn, that ought to offend any man: or, if that were withheld, he would speak of himself, in the most extravagant terms, not as I have known one man do, whom, I could not help forgiving for it, even at the time, offensive as it would have been in another, merely because, he spoke, and looked, as if he believed what he said; and as if he had been driven to acknowledge, what he was too honest, and too bold, to conceal or deny—his own proud opinion of himself. No; Wallace did not speak of himself, in that way, although he had seen the same person, that I just spoke of; and, having been dazzled and confounded by his great self confidence, had striven to imitate it. No! but he spoke of himself, in extravagant language, just as if it were a matter of calculation with him; and as if he, himself, did not believe what he said; but only thought of making other men believe it. So that, at last, if you studied him, as I did, you would, probably, have come to the same conclusion; which was, that he thought far too highly of himself, and spoke far more highly of himself, than he thought.” “In short, I studied him thoroughly; and set him down, at last, as a brilliant, idle creature, wonderfully mistaken by the world; and altogether ignorant of himself; presumptuous enough to imagine, that, by continually practising upon two or three paltry maxims, such as the veriest school boy will begin the world with, he would be able to overreach the rest of mankind. A pitiable delusion; but one, that has led many a vain fellow into a belief, that he was winding men about his finger, who were only withheld, by their compassion for his youth, from expressing their contempt for him. If he could have got rid of his artificial enthusiasm; counterfeit melancholy; his propensity to imitation, trick and deceit—a propensity which made him imitate what was altogether beneath himself;—play tricks with them that he most loved, without any possible excuse, unless it were that of habit;—and deceive people, where he had nothing to gain, and every thing to lose, by deceit;—and if he had shut himself up, and away from the world; studied and meditated for a few years, until his mind were composed, and habits of discipline and self denial were established, he might become an astonishing man; but he was likely, from all that I saw, to run only a short, useless, and shining career; wandering a while without aim, through the beautiful element that he had fallen into—heedless of the wonderful creatures that flew and swam, for ever about him— and terminating the whole,in darkness and forgetfulness. I pitied him, as I have told you—from my heart, I pitied him. It appeared to me that it was yet possible to save and reform him; and that, if any man could do it, it must be some friend; a true and honest friend, such as I could be to him. I had known the want of such an one, when I was another Wallace. But none came. God chose to save me, in his own way. I was well nigh wrecked, to be sure, body and soul; but that only made me the more thankful for his beneficent interposition; and I asked myself how I should acknowledge the mercy. By doing that to another, said my heart, which had it been done to me, when I was young and headstrong, would have saved me and mine, from utter degradation. Till I encountered Wallace, I had few opportunities of putting my thought into execution. Some young men, I had met, to be sure; but none that was ever in the same danger as he; or so much like what I, myself, had been, in my youth. You smile, William. Well, smile on. I do feel like an old man. I am an old man, when I compare myself with men, that were born about the same time with me. I feel as if I were of a generation before them. Smile on—I am in truth, much older at my heart; and far more experienced, than you, although we are so nearly of an age. However, to return to Wallace.—With all his faults, I feel assured that he was very sincere in his attachment to me; and that he dealt more plainly and directly with me, than with any body else; for the truth is, that he was afraid of me, even while he loved me; that he trembled before me, even while it was a pride and boast with him, that I was one of “his dear, five hundred friends.” I have mentioned how I came to see him; and, one day or other, perhaps, I may describe to you the whole of our first interview. It would make you smile. He was a good deal disturbed, and disappointed, when he saw me. He had expected to find me, a stern, thoughtful, and melancholy man, with a haughty forehead, wicked mouth, and austere eye; and he found me so totally unlike what he expected, that it was a good while, before he recovered from the shock, that my appearance gave him. Before I had well seated myself, I vol. ii. D found that there was quite too much electioneering address in his manner, for me. He was altogether too much of the gentleman. I have said, that he was disappointed, when he saw me; but he was yet more so, when he heard me talk. But he was afraid to tell me so; and was, therefore, put to the ridiculous necessity, of concealing his mortification, by a feigned enthusiasm, and surprise, which he continually expressed, at whatever I said; it mattered not, how common place, just as if he could discover some hidden meaning at the bottom;—and just, if he meant to make me believe, that he could see through all my affected simplicity, and directness; and detect the lurking and significant mystery, therein—with the readiness of a twin spirit— communing with another, before men, in some unknown language. This amused me a good deal, I assure you, for a time; but, at last, I felt a little offended; and, particularly, when I found that he would not understand me, at all; according to the received meaning of my words; and that he had the presumption to think of flattering me—as if any man could do that! William, you know that I am not made to play upon other men in that way; and still less, am I to be played upon. I hate mystery. I always speak, as I think. My speech is only audible thought. I think aloud. If played upon at all, it shall not be so gently. I cannot endure the dainty fingering of white-handed people. I am not a guitar, nor a jewsharp. If men will bring the musick out of my heart, let them leap upon it, at full length, like Handel upon the great German organ, and play upon it, with hands and feet. No! the little that I have, shall not be teased and pestered out of me, by babies. I continued near him. I began that night; and, before I left that part of the country, I had put him in training for greater matters;—and, in time, if he would have followed my advice, which was very simple, and confirmed by experiment on myself—and been content to labour steadily; and work, as if idleness in a man of genius, were impiety to God;—as if he felt that the power and capacity to be any thing, was altogether the same thing, as to be any thing;— and that talent was not intuition:—if he had done this, and been content, under the disregard of the world; awaiting, calmly, the consummation of his destiny; giving out, continually, that patient, affecting confidence in his Maker, which a man of true genius, with all his infirmities, cannot help giving, as an expression of gratitude, any more than the wilderness can help giving out its blossoming, and exhalation; and musick, and thanksgiving—after a shower, when the sunshine is upon it;—if he had been unintimidated, unyielding, determined against temptation and trial;—and had toiled on, for a few years only, as I shall toil, for ever and ever, till the world have gone through all her revolutions, with me, he might have been a beautiful phenomenon—not perhaps, an amazing one, perplexing the nations; but one, whose coming and going, would be stayed for, and sorrowed after by gentle hearts, and affectionate dispositions.— But enough of this. Let me relate two or three anecdotes of our acquaintance, that you may the better understand, how I expect to be treated by you, if we ever pledge our hands together—and what is the worth of my friendship” “We were about parting one night. I found it necessary to speak to him, face to face, like a man. I told him that sudden prepossessions were never to be depended upon: that the affection and esteem, of men, must be rooted; or they perish, with the first trial of cold and wind: that I had distrusted his sincerity---but that I began to think better of it. In short, I gave him a severe lesson,---for, I had began to love him; and I wanted to respect him. He was like what I had been, in temper: though I had never been a flatterer---and he was one; partly, by feeling, partly by nature, and partly by a settled design---giving out largely, that some of it, at least, might return to him, in the circulation of society ---curse such munificence! I say.” “Would you believe it?—many months after this, I received a letter from him; for I had consented to a correspondence, that I might keep pace with the growth of his thought—and he wrote, oftentimes, very beautifully—in which he repeated, almost verbatim, the remarks that I had addressed to him, together with my suspicion of his sincerity; and applied them to me! Had he forgotten the author? or did he believe that I had? No matter which—it showed the character of the man's mind. He was more anxious to write a beautiful letter, than a sincere one;—more solicitous for effect, than for friendship. He was disappointed, and could not bear to own it. He was like some young girl, in love for the first time, with something very commonplace, or perhaps crooked, like myself; endeavouring to torture her warped lover into beauty and proportion, correspondent with the heroes that she had read of—blind, and deaf, and obstinate to every thing like conviction. Thus, for a time too, he insisted on regarding me, as “grand, gloomy, and peculiar.” I laughed at the notion. I was neither gloomy, nor grand, by nature; nor willing to follow the fashion of the day, and be peculiar, like everybody that I knew. I had a character of my own, as distinct, as that of the founder, of the “grand and gloomy order,” Lord Byron himself:—another had the impudence to call me a “good natured fellow enough.” Fool!—had he known me better, he would have charged me with everything but good nature—and have been pretty cautious how he came near enough to me, to form any opinion at all of me.” “And once, when I was sitting with Wallace; and he had wrought himself up to the belief, that he had a great man in his room, I could not forbear, maliciously enough, too, I confess, to tell him what I had been— with the steadiest emphasis, and particularity in the world! His countenance grew paler and paler—trembled—paled and lengthened at every sentence; and he kept changing his position, till, at last, he had nearly turned his back upon me. It was a severe trial, I confess; and I have never yet found one of my new and violent admirers proof to it. One, a lady, who was quite an enthusiast, for awhile, overwhelming me with attention, was barely civil to me, after I acknowledged that I had, a few years before, lived in a shop, and sold tea to her.” “Wallace was a poet—a fiery and intemperate one, —and capable of being one of the first. But, when I knew him, he was labouring at the trade. I had dabbled in it—got some reputation, and found that mak ing, what we call poetry, was only setting madness to musick. And so—perhaps, because people said that I could not—I abandoned it—did abandon it, just as I had abandoned my painting—and the army—because people thought that I could not. William Adams!-I could do anything—where it depended upon myself. I can, yet.” “One evening, I was in his room—and he showed me some stanzas, upon which he had been toiling for two or three days. They were pretty; but full of faults; —and, when he demanded my opinion, I gave it freely, frankly, honestly. He was quite sore under it, and mortified, and begged me to write something. I could not well refuse, you know; and I dashed off a few lines, which he affected to relish exceedingly. I did not. I told him so; I took them up, began to criticise them; and, in fact, treated my own verses worse than I had his. I attempted to copy them, but I could not;—and, finally, at the end of a few minutes, I produced a fair copy, entirely different, however, from the original, even to the measure, tone, and thought. They were, really, very pretty and very unintelligible.[2] [2] The women, whether married, or about to be married, have, what they call, a quilting, which corresponds exactly, with this.— They give notice, and prepare their tea, “sweat meats” and mince-pies; and, in one afternoon, frequently, get a fine quilt entirely completed; after which, the men are admitted; and then follow a little dancing and romping To give them greater value, I said, vol. ii. D 2 as I laid down the pen. There—I shall write no more poetry.” “Are you serious?” said he—taking the cigar from his mouth, and knocking the ashes from it, over the edge of a wine glass, half full of old Madeira (for these things were, emphatically, a part of his library.) “Perfectly,” I replied. “Then you will have no objection to say so, in black and white:”—offering to fill my glass— “Not the least—no, no, I thank you—I have drunk one glass, to please you.” “Only this one—it won't hurt you,” said he. “No”—I replied, “not another drop.” “Do me the favour then to write, under these lines, (they had been written in the book of a fine girl that he was then loving—after the fashion of poets) that you have done with poetry.” “With all my heart”—I did—dated the note—and signed my name to it. A long time after this, he begged leave to dedicate a poem to me. I consented, on condition that he should be very temperate. Soon after, a manuscript came on to me, with a letter, praying that I would do—what he had not the patience to do— see the faults in it, and correct them. I was willing to make him my friend, if he had the metal for it;— and, while I thought of the Bishop in Gil Blas, I went about the work; and cut and slashed, into the very heart of the manuscript;—knowing, that, savage as it appeared—that was the only way of trying his fortitude. The poem was printed—but he could not bear it. He never spoke of it, though I pressed him directly and indirectly. At last, that, which he had promised to dedicate to me, came on, in manuscript. I read it. It was a dark, taugled web—of brilliancy and shadow—but without order and design. The colours were rich—the tissue golden—and, with a proper management—tapestry worthy of Heaven, and all her stars, might have been woven out of it—but no! the yarns were knotted and snarled. I told him so, and returned it. It requires a stout heart, William Adams —to take such aliment, from one that you reverence, as I offered him; but a stouter heart, and a bolder hand, to offer it I did my duty—I drove the knife home— home to the vitals of the sufferer,—determined to let out the black pestilent humour, the thick, coagulated blood; and save him, if I could. Months went by, and no reply. I found it necessary to write, and to speak, once for all very plainly. Months went by, again— and I received an answer. He had been sick—even unto death, he said. That letter which you have by you, is a copy of my last to him. It will show you what I am.” I opened the letter, and read, as follows—(it is still in my possession.) “But for your sake, my dear Wallace, I should never write to you another line. I had nearly come once to the resolution, never to speak, nor think, nor write of you again. You have been ill. I am sorry for it.— But the worst illness that you have, is one, of which, whatever be the consequences. I am determined to speak plainly.—You want resolution, steadiness, and resisting power. But why do I tell you this? would I mock at your misery? No. But I would tell you a plain truth, while it is not yet too late. You are fickle—feeble of heart; too easily elated; too easily depressed. You forget me, probably the truest friend that you ever had, or ever will have—and why? merely because, in compliance with your continual importunity, I took some liberties with your poem; and you thought of playing off a yet haughtier manner before me, because I returned another to you, with my sincere and honest opinion. Do you want a flatterer, for a friend? You do. You search for flattery, as for your natural aliment. You are prodigal of it, to others. Your own good opinion of yourself is not sustenance enough, for your diseased appetite. You crave that of fools, given to repletion and loathing; and quickened with a mortal poison, which you mistake for pungency. I speak plainly; and I wish it to sink deeply; for God only knows whether I shall ever write to you again. One effort I am willing to make—one, that makes my heart heave and collapse—it is for your good. I am willing to forget all that has passed, on this plain and easy condition, that, hereafter, you go steadily about the work of reformation It will not be the work of a week, nor a month, nor a year. But begin it.— make up your mind to it. I do not fear to deal thus with you, now. But the time may come, when it would be folly or cruelty—when I should either pity you too much, or scorn you too much, for such an attempt. I would not wound any human being; still less, one that I have loved and respected in any degree, unless I knew that it was not too late. With you, it is not. Let me conjure you, Wallace—let me conjure you! with tears in my eyes, to have done, forever, with flattery.— Teach your own heart to loathe it. In the next place, let me pray you, never to ask another's opinion,until you are prepared for its being unfavorable, and sure of his honesty, at least; and then, though his opinion be unpalatable—though he be wrong—for that may well be, sometimes; I pray you, treat him with respect, however you may treat his opinion. And last of all; I pray you; if you wish to be, what you may be, if your ambition be of the right sort—if it be not that childish, brief passion for notoriety, which all young men of quick sensibility, will feel at times—I pray you to undertake something, no matter what, for a livelihood and name. Hold yourself aloof from the world.— Avoid it. Go to your room; use a regular and temperate exercise; rigid economy; and never emerge—never! but to your grave, or to distinction. You are yet young. The great world is before you. Are you capable of this? You are. I am—have been —have done—and am yet doing it; and I grow surer and surer, every day, that I shall prevail at last. Yet what have I; or rather, what had I, at your age, of evil in my nature, that you have not?—Nothing. I was as capricious; sensitive; vain; ambitious, without aim or object; as impatient of delay and restraint; and as incapable of brooking humiliation, however well or ill merited. But, I have learnt some wisdom since; not much; but some—the profit of which, may be yours. In the name then, of all that is lordly and beautiful in man's nature, let me implore you. Wallace, to undertake this! Begin immediately; you have not an hour to lose. Begin, and despair not. You will prevail. If you feel that you are able to begin, write to me. I will treat you as ever; and not revive the subject. If not, never let me hear from you again. I will have no man for a friend, who is not capable of this.— And I have done with acquaintances. My correspondence is broken up. My professional business employs me, night and day. But, if you accept of my condition, I shall remain your friend and correspondent. Understand me. You do not know me, if you believe that I am to be thrown off, and whistled back again, at pleasure. No—I know too well the value of my own friendship—my own value. I forgive you, for your neglect of me; but I do not, and will not forgive you, for your neglect of yourself, your genius, talent, and friend. Do not be rash. You have time to think, before you answer me. It is hard going back. Yes—Mr. Pullen has been here. We had but little conversation, respecting you. But, I spoke very plainly. As to his opinion of me; and the opinions of all, who, eight months ago, thought humbly of me, you are mistaken. I stand higher than ever, in their respect.— I knew it. I knew that I should, then—I said so. But, they did not believe it—it was thought vanity in me to say so—I bore it, though I was told, that nothing which could possibly happen, during the lapse of many years, would change the opinion of one person, respecting me. It was a rash word; and my heart was hot, when I heard it. But, I have stood still—and they have all done me justice, at last. Yes—the time has already come, sooner, to be sure, than I thought; and, though my folly and wickedness are not forgotten, yet, other, and higher qualities have arisen in their stead— in a soil too, that might have been barren, for ever— for it was one of iron. This is the nature of things. Upturn; or scorch; or trample down, the pestilent herbage of your heart, as I did that of mine; and you will soon find healthier plants there; medicinal plants, that might never have appeared, had not the soil been first broken up, and fertilized by decay, corruption and death. To be purified, we must pass through fire and water. What say you? Are you able to do this?—to endure it? If yea, let me embrace you. We may yet stand together, side by side, like brothers, an example of what steadiness and resolution may effect, in spite of the whole world. You are under a mistake. Mr. Pullen never refrained from writing to me—except for a little time— till he was master of his feeling. I drove him to it, as I have you—by a peremptory manner. I will not be kept in suspense, where I have anything at stake.” Yours, ALBERT HAMMOND. “P. S.—Leave out the “Esquire,” in your address to me.” I lifted my eyes, when I had finished the letter, and started at the intenseness of Hammond's gaze—our faces almost touched. His forehead was wrought, his countenance lighted up—and there was a cold, intrepid, searching manner, in his aspect; without passion; without tumult, vehemence or enthusiasm, that made one feel strangely, very strangely, at the heart. You will recollect that he was remarkably pale—with very bright eyes—a profusion of loose hair, except just upon the top of his head, where he was quite bald—so that, his head looked larger; and his forehead much broader than it was. The natural expression of his face too, was very severe—but the settled one, at this time, was an artificial sternness and fixedness. “What think you now, of my friendship?” said he. “Could you bear such a letter as that?” “Yes,” I replied;—wondering at the disproportionate size of his head. “And what would you do? (never mind the size of my head) pistol me, I suppose, off hand.” “I beg your pardon—I—That would depend upon our intimacy. Pistol you! No. I would examine my own heart. I would know there, if what you had said, were true. If it were—I would bless you for it, and put forth all my strength—though it killed me—in one continual effort to be great. If it were not—and I should soon know it, if it were not—I would put your letter by, and when you were upon your death bed— or I, upon mine, I would put it into your hands.” “William Adams!” cried the creature, leaping upon his feet, and halting up to me—“there is my hand! from this hour, let our friendship begin. It is not now, nor do I pretend that it is, what it will be. I cannot love you, all at once—nor, can you leap into my heart— that whirlpool of passion and wrath—without some preparation. You know me not---verily, I have a devil here---but, I have clipped his wings, I hope.” “And made him---a prisoner, for ever!”---said I. “Yes---but I have diluted his poison---and pared his nails. I keep him now, only for such cattle as we met to-day.” “By the way,” cried I---gasping for breath---“I was on the point of asking you---but I dared not.” “Speak out. What is it?” “Did not---I pray you, pardon me---did not the lash touch you?” “Did'nt it!---Why aye, I rather think it did. But, you shall see.” He rung the bell, and ordered the servant to get him a shirt. By heaven, there was a red and blue welt, where the whip had buckled round him, that girdled his waist, like a swollen serpent. “You—you—” I could not articulate, for some moments. “What shall you do to him?” “What would you have me do?” “Kill him....murder him....strangle him.” “Upon my word, William Adams---Neck or Nothing rather. I am likely to have a precious acquaintance of you! Why should I kill—murder—and strangle the poor devil? Have you any choice in the matter—one or all—I am half ready to do your bidding.— But, seriously—has he not suffered terribly enough, already, for stabbing me?” “For stabbing you!—yes. But not for horsewhipping you.” “I'll tell you what, William Adams,” said he, after a moment of deep seriousness---“there is something wrong in your heart about this. Have you ever been horsewhipped?” “I---I!---Would you have me curse you to your face?” “Well then,” said he, “all that I can say is, that you are a d—d incomprehensible fellow; and most of a lunatick, when the world think you least of one. What! You would have me kill a poor devil, outright, merely because he horsewhipped me!” “To be sure;” said I---“I would---though it were in church.” “Hurrah! for Walter Scott!” cried Hammond---you are of the gentry that, “Right their wrongs, wherever given, “In churches, or the court of heaven! “You appear indignant. A little more, and I shall look to feel your knife in my side. But, soberly, my dear William; this will never do. The age of blood has gone by. Chivalry is done with. There are laws and magistrates now. And we have so little opportunity of playing a brave part, or a great one, in our limited sphere of action, that, if it please you, for we are henceforth to stand or fall together, in this world---we will content ourselves with doing good---as the act directs---as humanity, and the law, and the Gospel---and a Good God have commanded us---without bloodshed. What say you to that?” I was strangely affected. His voice went through my heart; and there was a deep movement, an inward agitation there, as if he had been the first visiter, to its best place. I embraced him---and forgot, as I did, that he was so cursedly ugly of shape---that---no matter, let the dogs bark at such men---they are regal creatures, within their own dominions, of magnificent stature and bearing---wherever their souls have room to stretch their limbs, and walk abroad. Upon my soul, I have seen that man, Albert Hammond, on many occasions, but particularly on one—when I could have fallen upon my face, before him, and done reverence to him, as the only true believer, in him, who taught the doctrine of peace and long suffering, that I had ever known. I remember the whole affair, as well as if it was yesterday. We had been to a RAISING, in New England. A raising, is the name there, given to a peculiar, rational frolick. Most of the people, or nineteen twentieths of them, live in wooden houses. And their mode of getting the frame put up, is what they call, a RAISING. The frame of timber is prepared, marked, and arranged; notice is then given, through all the country, round about, that, on such a day, the frame will be put up.[3] [3] I have since found a copy of these lines—you will recollect that they were the last—the very last that Hammond ever wrote—and written, I am assured, precisely as it is related above; and, in consequence of much persuasion. All the day and night before, VOL. II. E if it be in a part of the country, which is not very populous.—Nay, for several days and nights before, scores and scores, of sturdy young men, would be seen, flocking to the place; some on foot, and some on horseback—and some with their teams—(by which they mean ox-teams only, throughout New England; for there you will hardly ever see a team of horses; and here, by the way, it were well to mention that, in New England, they do not drive their oxen with a whip, but simply with what they call a gourd, meaning, probably,a good. It is a long, slender walnut stick, (about five feet long, with a brad in the end, which they manage with exceeding dexterity.) At last, the day dawns.— At day light, the tables are spread—cider—beer—metheglin—egg-pop—meat—(rum or whiskey now, or punch)—pumpkin-pies—and all,that the country affords, may be seen lying about, under the trees, and upon the grass, where a multitude of women and children are assembled, The signal is given; and up go the joice, timber and braces, in every direction, with the celerity of magick. The frame completely set up; and sometimes boarded all over, and even clapboarded, or shingled; and some refreshment taken, the rest of the day is consumed in athletick; and, often in very dangerous amusements—of which, leaping, pitching quoits, and shooting at turkeys, and poultry, are the principal, with small rifle balls, sixty to the pound, scarcely larger than a buck shot. It is at these places, that the champions of all the country round, are sure to assemble; and wo to the man, that prevails in the wrestling ring. There is no peace with him, for the rest of his days. He is bound to contend with all who may offer; like the champion of England, not only on the day of his victory, but at every other day, wherever he may be. It was on one of these occasions, that I saw Hammond, who had been a silent spectator of the scene, for a long time, without opening his mouth, suddenly set upon by a brutal wretch, a little in liquor, who, in retreating from a pair of wrestlers, trod upon Hammond's foot. Some little altercation followed—during which, the man was too abusive almost for human patience;—till, at last, Hammond had become the laughing stock of all the boys about. I could hardly help enjoying it, I confess; and yet my blood boiled—coward as I was—when I saw the looks of the dwarf. He was deadly pale—absolutely white—but not so much, from anger, as from inward strife. At last, the man collared him.—What was the consequence? Nothing but this—Hammond buckled his long, lithe arms, with the swiftness of a black snake, about his waist—knuckled his back, till his head and heels almost touched; and laid him down, gently, upon the grass—amid the most deathlike stillness that I ever saw. It was near nightfall—but from that moment, the sports were over; and the people separated on the spot, drunk or sober; and every man went his way, as if he had seen the devil.— Nobody knew him; and nobody stepped forward, as had been the custom, for ever, on such occasions— to try a fall with him, when he had thrown the man, whom we found after, to have been, for years, the bully of all the country round. I should have killed him. But Hammond merely put him down, as if he pitied him. Yet, I was weak; and Hammond had the strength of a ring-tailed panther, or an ourang outang, whom by the way,he much resembled: nay, I have seen him wrestle with a bear, and prevail too—almost to the tearing of the animal's jaws asunder—though it was not quite grown, I confess. Then, there is what they call a Husking, which is confined to the New England states, (the legitimate Yankee population,) for, at the South, the blacks do the business After the corn, not what the English call corn—but Indian corn is got in; the men and women, young and old, assemble together, night after night, at each others houses—and tear the husks off from the corn, and weave it, by one or two remaining upon each ear, into large bundles, when required; or leave it in heaps to dry, in the garner or barn. It is at these Husking-frolicks, that most of what may be called fun, is to be met with in this country. The girls romp—and laugh—and sing, with all their heart and soul, as if to shew the yeomanry what they would do, if they were wived—lawfully. But there is no bundling in New England. That is confined, if it exist at all, now, to Pennsylvania, New York—and to the Dutch and German settlers, or their descendants. And even with those, it is wonderful how little advantage can be taken of it. I have an intimate friend—a painter, of great talent— who was invited to bundle with a very pretty girl, at a house where he staid, in travelling, by her own mother. He was amazed; but consented, of course. The girl, contrary to what he looked for— did not undress. She only threw off her outer loose gown—she was young and wild—but he assures me, and I believe him—that the girl would not, and did not, permit him to take any liberties whatever, with her, except such as he might have taken with any country girl, in open day light, without reproach—as kissing and hugging, for instance; and, that whenever he grew troublesome, she cried out, or threatened to—and the house was full of people, who would have received any insult, as a breach of honor and decency. Such is custom!—Ed. TO —. I will!—the light that beams from thee, Burning in hallowed purity, To poets—is pure poetry, And inspiration too!— What then?—though I may often swear To write no more—I can't forbear, When playing round thy lids, I see That light of sweet sincerity, That light of tearful blue— Away—away—I'll sing to thee Whate'er may be my destiny— I'll be forsworn—be any thing So thou wilt lighten while I sing. On looking at them again—I begin to lose my patience. Wallace has made the publick so familiar with his imitations of Hammond, that, even to my own eye, they look like imitations of him.— To me, there is nothing left of their original freshness, to atone for the violent nonsense of a poet. However—there they are.—Ed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“But for your sake, my dear Wallace, I should never write to you another line. I had nearly come once to the resolution, never to speak, nor think, nor write of you again. You have been ill.

You forget me, probably the truest friend that you ever had, or ever will have—and why? merely because, in compliance with your continual importunity, I took some liberties with your poem; and you thought of playing off a yet haughtier manner before me, because I returned another to you, with my sincere and honest opinion.

You do not know me, if you believe that I am to be thrown off, and whistled back again, at pleasure. No—I know too well the value of my own friendship—my own value. I forgive you, for your neglect of me; but I do not, and will not forgive you, for your neglect of yourself, your genius, talent, and friend. Do not be rash. You have time to think, before you answer me. It is hard going back. Yes—Mr. Pullen has been here. We had but little conversation, respecting you. But, I spoke very plainly. As to his opinion of me; and the opinions of all, who, eight months ago, thought humbly of me, you are mistaken. I stand higher than ever, in their respect.— I knew it. I knew that I should, then—I said so. But, they did not believe it—it was thought vanity in me to say so—I bore it, though I was told, that nothing which could possibly happen, during the lapse of many years, would change the opinion of one person, respecting me. It was a rash word; and my heart was hot, when I heard it. But, I have stood still—and they have all done me justice, at last. Yes—the time has already come, sooner, to be sure, than I thought; and, though my folly and wickedness are not forgotten, yet, other, and higher qualities have arisen in their stead— in a soil too, that might have been barren, for ever— for it was one of iron. This is the nature of things. Upturn; or scorch; or trample down, the pestilent herbage of your heart, as I did that of mine; and you will soon find healthier plants there; medicinal plants, that might never have appeared, had not the soil been first broken up, and fertilized by decay, corruption and death. To be purified, we must pass through fire and water. What say you? Are you able to do this?—to endure it? If yea, let me embrace you. We may yet stand together, side by side, like brothers, an example of what steadiness and resolution may effect, in spite of the whole world. You are under a mistake. Mr. Pullen never refrained from writing to me—except for a little time— till he was master of his feeling. I drove him to it, as I have you—by a peremptory manner. I will not be kept in suspense, where I have anything at stake.” Yours, ALBERT HAMMOND. “P. S.—Leave out the “Esquire,” in your address to me.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Grouping...Mrs. H—...Elizabeth...A family...Disputation... Modesty...Hammond...Miss E—...Well bred People... Old School and New...Shakspeare...Friendship...Mr. D.... Hamlet. “Pray,” said Elizabeth, to Hammond, as we all sat together, the very first evening that he appeared below, his lovely hostess, in a loose wrapper, and in a most captivating humour. “Pray, answer me two or three questions more about that insolvent law.” “O, no—in mercy—no!—Let us have no agrument to night,” said Mrs. H—, “Come, come, you are an invalide, you know; and all our arrangements are made---wrangling aside---for a lively, cheerful evening.” I looked up in her face, while she spoke. Her voice was melody itself; but there was a little—a very little affectation in it:—yet, nevertheless, not forgetting a dash of coquetry, and an occasional sally of the eye, showing a familiarity, with early and uninterrupted dominion.—She was a singularly beautiful, and engaging woman for her age. “Nay, Miss Adams; remember that I am an invalide. Let your questions be few, or some of my blood vessels may give way; for Mrs. H. I perceive, by her eyes, look!—is foraging already, in our cantonment of hearts. We shall soon be brought to battle.” “You mentioned something of analogy, in our last conversation. I have looked a little into the matter, since I saw you,” said Elizabeth. “Shall I tell you why?” said Hammond, interrupting her. “If you please.” “Because I flattered you. It turned your head.”— Elizabeth coloured—but there was less of anger, than of surprise, in the expression of her face.” “Upon my word!” said she, “I cannot deny it. But, you have taught me, by that remark, how to estimate your compliments.” He was touched—I could perceive that—for his lips trembled, and his brows worked, as he replied. “Pray, what were you saying of analogy?” “I would have said—but for your timely interference, which prevented me from exposing myself--” “Nay—now, you are angry with me!” “No—not angry,” she replied. “But hurt, I suppose. Well, well, let me have it.— Prove to me, that you are not angry. If you are not, you will proceed.” Elizabeth recovered her good humour immediately— and continued. “Where is the analogy, of which you spoke, to justify your opinion, that each state, had the power to pass an insolvent law!” “O—there is no longer any question about that, you know. That is admitted. The supreme court, does not deny it. But what is an insolvent law? That is the point. I say, that it is a law, protecting the citizens of that state, and no other, where it is passed; and not interfering with any other state. I find sufficient analogy for this doctine, in the concurrent powers of the general government, and the individual governments. Each may pass laws for the punishment of crime: each has had, and may still have naturalization laws:—and each has the right of levying taxes. But, observe, in every case, this power of the state, must be limited, not only, so as to operate exclusively within its own jurisdiction, but so, as not to interfere, in any way, with the neighbouring states.” “No evil can arise, where no interference can take place, of this nature; and it cannot, under a state insolvent law, whatever be its provisions.” “Very well. I think that I can understand that;” continued Elizabeth. “But, what of the policy of the law. What of imprisonment for debt?” “One word of the latter, first. If a man will contract to be imprisoned, it is all very well. In one way or other, it will be effectual at last. But, it is a useless VOL. II. E 2 and barbarous remedy—an effectual one. I admit; but so would torture be. I hope that it will be abolished, in this county; and I do not doubt that it will. It has been in every civilized people upon this earth, by one qualification and another. And what will be its consequence, here? This, and this only. The creditor, if he think the risk greater, without the right of imprisonment, than with it, will charge a higher price for his merchandise. That will be all. We shall protect ourselves then, by enlarging the premium or profit, a rate of interest, till it weigh down the risk. You can make a contract now, that you shall not be imprisoned; but, you must pay in proportion. You will do no more, when imprisonment for debt is abolished.” “Of the policy of an insolvent, or bankrupt law, I have little to say. It is, emphatically, a national blessing. Look into the history of all the nations of the earth. Just exactly, in proportion to their commercial importance, has always been the liberality of their insolvent and bankrupt law, toward the honest debtor”. “In England, they punish the fraudulent one, with death; but allow the honest one, a support for his family, in the shape of commission. In France, they send the first to the gallows, and the latter to the Elysian fields.” “Without it, you make slaves of them, that God hath afflicted. Observe what I say. Make a fraudulent bankruptcy criminal. But punish it, as you do other crimes—with severity, in proportion to the difficulty of proof, and the greatness of the temptation. But, before you punish, let the guilt of the offender be formally established. At present, a large part of our most valuable population; enough, I know, if they would confederate, to shake the union to her foundation, if not to a dismemberment—men of wisdom and experience— literally schooled in adversity, are left in a condition more deplorable than our slaves. They have no right to property—till they have paid all their debts; but how many can ever do that? Their slavery descends to their posterity—in the worst shape; they are unable to to educate them—and are made to entail ignorance, poverty, and wretchedness upon them. Their liberty is not their own—nay, nor their lives; for they may be immured, their young hearts beating for valorous achievement—and left, to rot away, piecemeal, in a prison house, worse than any grave; for they can look out of it, and see others walking about, unfettered; they can hear too; and the musick of men's affairs, the voices, of the free, and hearty, and happy, torture them, like the taunting of devils.” “Hundreds and hundreds of human creatures lie idle; for, they cannot work—nobody will trust them; or will not work—merely that their sweat and blood may not be counted out, drop by drop, to their task masters—to undergo a transmutation, in their sweltering hearts— to gold. But no—no!—I will not think of these things. The time has not yet come. But, by the living God! if there were a few such men, as our fathers were, they would soon find a Canaan and a Joshua. We would go out, from among the Egyptians, and form an empire of our own! Dastards—Dastards! These insolvent debtors would stand by, I do believe, and see their wives and daughters profaned; and their children made into mince pies, for thanksgiving dinners, to their patrician lords, without lifting their hands.” “But suppose that a natural bankrupt law should be passed—or a law, protecting the person only, of insolvent debtors—that is—a law compelling a man to be a scoundrel, under the penalty of starvation;—for how can he get any property—how support himself, if nothing be left to him—and his earning, for a time be not protected?—(when his nest egg is taken from him every morning) unless he became a rogue?” “What would be the consequence? This, and this only. People would protect themselves more carefully by their contracts—demand higher profits, prices, or interest; or security. This accursed evil would then pass away, for ever.” “Judge Marshall grants to each state, the power of passing a statute of limitation. Give them that; and what more do they want? They may, as effectually, shelter the insolvent, by that, as by any law of insolvency. It would be only necessary to pass a law, declaring that certain contracts should not be available at all, after a certain event had arrived, unless judgment were obtained before, which judgment should be good only, till another event should happen. Why may not this event be insolvency? Such is the law, in relation to judgments-on simple contracts--it is precisely that. I see little difficulty in it. There is no reason why an event that operates as a limitation, may not become “a rule of pleading,” as well as a period of time, which is so called, because it so operates.” “Or suppose that—for, several of the states, profiting of his hint, that they may make such rules of pleading as they please, have done so-suppose that a state should pass a law, not for “staying execution,” as they call it, for one, two, or three years—but to all eternity. If they have a right to do the one—they have a right to do the other. And why not go further?—and say that, in certain cases (which may correspond with our insolvent cases) no execution at all shall issue?” “Would this be impairing the obligation of contracts? Certainly not; for Judge Marshall says; and he is supported by Lord Mansfield—that the obligation of a contract is one thing; the remedy another. A state may regulate the remedy at her own discretion—but she may not, and shall not touch the obligation!” “I like these distinctions. They save a thick headed, plain man abundance of trouble. So—instead of quarrelling with Judges Marshall and Mansfield, about definitions; I will only say to the state authority: Protect me, as you have a right to do, against the remedy; and the devil may take the obligation. Just, give me a rule of pleading, by which my creditor shall not be permitted to meddle with me for the next fifty, or one hundred years; and I will give you no trouble about the obligation.” “I have done.” “Upon my word, I am glad of it!” cried Mrs. Honeywell, rubbing her eyes, and yawning. “You say a great deal about Lord Mansfield—is Lord Chesterfield no authority with you? One of your formal creatures —Lord!—how I should like to see you pleading before a fine woman—in that way. You would soon come to the—the—butter—rebutter, is it not?” “No—the joinder, and rejoinder first” “O yes! and then the re-butter—and surrebutter—take my word for it, you would soon be the SIR-rebutled” “Well done!—cried Hammond—tell me, now, honestly—you've heard that before—hav'nt you?”' “No—positively—no—never.” “But you made it before hand?—or have said it before.” She nodded, and laughed. “I could have sworn it,” said Hammond, “by your blundering about the butter so long. You meant to make a pun of that too, I suppose. What was it?” “I forget—it slipped through my fingers.” “Ha, ha, ha!—you are incorrigible. I see plainly. Your last visit to Philadelphia has spoilt you, utterly. I began to have some hopes of you, till then. We must send you to Cambridge—Harvard—there is a man there, who puns in the pulpit—in his prayers. I have heard him.” I looked at Hammond with astonishment. How came it that he was such a favourite, and with beautiful women too?—He never flattered then. He was abrupt, loud, and imperious. Yet they bore with him, ugly as he was. They seemed to forget that he was a dwarf. How natural he was! With what an air of readiness and sincerity.—with what a heart, he said every thing, even the most trivial! Where had he learnt to trifle so gracefully? It is the most difficult thing in the world, I have heard, to do it,—without lessening one's own dignity. Yet he did it; and there was such an agreeable raciness, pungency, flavour and juiciness in what he said—that indeed. I can well understand now, what a woman of great wit and accomplishment, once said to me; that the nonsense of a great mind was more tolerable, than the good sense of an ordinary one. It is so. We love to see straws and violets handled gracefully—though they be handled by a strong man, in armour. I saw Elizabeth whispering to Mrs. Honeywell— just after this—and heard her say, “provoke him— bring him out—William does'nt know him—we are all alone, you know. Do, do!” Mrs. H. nodded; and a few moments after, began to quote poetry. Her manner was happy; her memory good; and one of her old friends, a maiden lady, of strong understanding, but too abrupt and decided in the expression of her likes and dislikes, sat near her— and cut in, now and then, herself. “Let us tie up the bell,” said the latter,—(her name was Miss Emmitt,)--- and make ourselves at home this evening.” “Lest some of your favourites may intrude?” said Mrs. H. spitefully, I thought. “Upon my word,” said Hammond, “I feel a presentiment, that the Frenchman, to whom you were so rude —or the lawyer, whom by the way, you do not understand,---the creature of your abhorrence and detestation---will—.” “The reptile!”---answered Miss Emmitt, with a scornful emphasis. “Allow me,” said Hammond, turning about and facing her-- “allow me, to do that man justice. You are disposed to underrate him. He is no fool; no reptile;--- he is a man of sound, homely, good sense; and a good heart. Believe me---I know him.” “You do not know, I am sure that you do not, the reason of my dislike;---the contemptible creature!” “Nay, Miss Emmitt---that is unworthy of you---beneath you. It proves that you do not think him contemptible, when his very name disturbs you”---(“with passion,” he would have added---but---he stopped short ---and his eyes dwelt, for a moment, upon her face, so steadily, that the colour mounted there.) “If you knew—” “I do know it,” continued Hammond, interrupting her. “He behaved in a shameful manner. It was unpardonable. But you owe it to your own dignity, not to show that you were outraged by it.” “Then you do know---who told you?---Mrs. Honeywell---or Mrs. Carter---or Miss Julia.” “It was purely, accidental;---and, upon my word, I have forgotten who told me.” “No---you are unwilling to tell me.” “Miss Emmitt!” said Hammond, with great dignity. I understood him; and the blue eyes of Mrs. Honeywell, dashed abroad for a moment, with a sort of ma licious pleasantry. Elizabeth sat near her; and their arms, I observed, were intertwined---a little of that sweet coquetry, which beautiful women, when they are in the presence of men, are never utterly without---- caressing and affectionate---they prepare our hearts, inwardly, for the nourishment of those silken tendrils that, if torn, will bleed for ever---when they shall once have been knitted to us. Hammond was in the opposite corner; I, in the middle, so situated, that I could see the working of every countenance about me, without being seen. Over my head, burnt a beautiful lamp like thin moonlight---the milky coloured globe on the top, shedding a pale vapour, as if it were a great pearl, with a lamp of revolving fire in the centre. I took a survey of the company; and, leisurely, entered their features upon my memory. First, there was Hammond, his great, pale, swarthy face, under the shadow of the mantle piece—his broad knotted forehead written all over, with phenomena, like the sky—with the annals of God: his long lithe arms, folded and intertwined, as if there were no bones in them; and one of his ugly legs drawn up so, that, at times, his knee almost touched his chin. His eyes were nearly shut; and they were vivid and fearful—terrible—when he opened them—but about his mouth, there was an expression of intense beauty, that all felt—but none could account for. It was the terrour of his wrought lip; the deep, and instantaneous electricity of his thought; —the sallying out of his imagination;—and the bold, strange eloquence of his heart, that issued there—that it was, which made his mouth the rallying point of all eyes and thoughts. In the opposite corner, was Elizabeth—her delicate, undulating figure wrapped up in the ugliest shawl “as I'm alive,” that was ever worn—even by a fashionable woman:—her countenance, full of anxiety and expression—but subdued;—her hair, profusely, and negligently wound up, like dark coloured, rough gold— upon her finely turned head,—her blue-veined hand covering her temples; and half buried, in the loose, abundant hair. She was leaning upon the arm of the sofa —and when she spoke,—it was seldom indeed—that night, it was in an unknown tongue. I knew her not —the action of her mind seemed to be suspended—the substance dissipated. It was all flavour tone, beauty—colour and essence.—but without body. Twice —when she was most forgetful, there was a timid and strange movement of her eyes, toward the opposite corner as if their haughtiness had been, some day or other, rebuked there. They were haughty—that's the truth on't —even when down-cast:—and shed, even through the shut, cowering lids, a sort of intellectual light, that, with the sweet wisdom of her mouth, a fellow would be very unwilling to disturb idly—I should think. And once too, when Hammond was in all the heat and hurry of his mind, during an accident, which I shall just mention. I caught her eyes rivetted upon him, with an expression that alarmed me—I know not why:—I should have said that it was—like jealousy, if Elizabeth had not been my sister,—or envy, perhaps; but I do not know. The sensation was death like, quick and hot—like the sting of a little serpent—a sickness and scalding at the heart, and a trouble in my blood. She saw me looking at her—and coloured all over;—and her delicate fingers played, with an agitated, incessant, involuntary activity, for some minutes after, among the dim tufted gold upon her white temples. Hammond too—had he seen it?—his teeth were set,—his glittering white teeth, and his red lip, writhed bitterly—But--- let me describe the others. Our number, in a little while, had augmented to seven, or eight; but, as they came in, one after the other, during the debate, I mention it now, that I may not be taken off, by and by, when I am better employed, by repeating the conversation that followed. I wish to do it accurately; and, I believe, that I can—to the very words—for never did any thing of the sort make such a distinct impression upon me.— Everything that Hammond uttered, fell, as if it were weighty and hot, upon a heart of wax; and sunk deeper and deeper—at every sob—till—till—no matter for the rest. You understand me—till their most worthless tablets became heavy with his thought, without their suspecting it—pregnant with his spirit, believing it their own,—rich, with the melted ore that he had poured into them, with a prodigal hand, without (for they saw that it did not impoverish him)—thankfulness, that it enriched them. Next to Elizabeth, reclining, like Cleopatra, in her barge, was Mrs. Honeywell; a lightly wreathed turban, like drifted snow, wound about her beautiful forehead, and dark, glossy hair; her blue eyes, young and passionate as ever; and lips, even in their over-ripeness, shedding a warm and voluptuous exhalation. Next to her, sat one of her two daughters; a fair haired, noble looking girl—with a superb person, tranquil, blue eyes; a most beautiful neck; a sweet, red mouth; and a mild, doubtful, uncharacterised, but amiable manner. She had a newspaper in her hand. “What is the meaning of that?” said she; reaching it to me. “I cannot understand it.” “It was the census of the United states.” I told her, looking at a part of the sheet, where I thought her eyes directed. “No, no—I do not mean that. I know that. But where am I to look, for the—the—” “For the total?” said I—there it is—there, by your hands...nine millions, and—” “What!—nine millions in Philadelphia—is it possible!” (Her eyes were upon the word Pennsylvania.) “O, no;” said I. “Nine millions in the whole United states.” “Is it possible!” said she, in the same tone of astonishment, precisely! The population of our city, is not mentioned here;” said I. “It is, I believe, however, somewhat over one hundred thousand.” VOL. II. F “Is it possible!” she exclaimed. I looked at her, in astonishment. She had just been amazed, that there were nine millions in the city; and was, now, just as much amazed, to find one hundred thousand. I smiled, and spoke of it afterward, to Hammond. “You cannot easily understand that woman;” said he. “She has a noble, and feeling heart; but, she has been spoiled by her mother—a coquette, without knowing it; great good sense; and a quick, but deep and hidden sensibility, which she, herself, is ignorant of. Her observations were perfectly natural. I know the very tone and look, with which they were made. She has caught them of her mother; a remarkably well bred woman, who is “mightily” apt to anticipate your thought; and answer, without understanding it—not because she cannot understand it— but, because her mind is away. Her daughter, amiable and mild, like her mother, is sometimes playful and witty; but, not like her mother, she wants practice, and experience. It takes a longer time, to make a well bred woman, or man, than people generally imagine. Children do well enough, to stand up with, in a cotillion party; but, if you are to parade a ball room, or walk about, in the presence of majesty, your only companion is the gentleman, or lady, of the last century. Gracious heaven! how unlike, in their courtly ease, superb self possession, and stately promptitude, to the ribald patch-work gentry of the present day; compare the graceful impudence, and easy trifling, of the old school, with the awkward pawing, and pleasantry of the new. I cannot endure the latter; and, for that reason, I never go into what is called good company, or well-bred society, unless it be into that of the well bred, of the last generation but one. I hate your loud, vociferous merriment—your unmeaning tartness—your lubberly ease—your starch formality; at parties, for example, with powdered black footmen; such, as I have seen taken from the plough, set into shoes, like wooden dishes—and employed in carrying round, not a loaded waiter of turnips and beets, carved into the shape of cauliflowers, and white and red roses—but each one, with his great sprawling, cracked hands, a single sugar-bowl—one of white, another of brown. No— curse such flummery, I say.” Next to this daughter, was another; a younger one; utterly unlike her sister, in person, heart, and character; a sour looking, pale faced, thin girl; with a spiteful, old-maidish expression in her eyes—and a great sharpness of tone—staid—stiff—rude—impudent and busy; with a singularly quick, active, and good mind; but, destitute of sensibility, originality, charity, enthusiasm, and sweetness of temper. Had she been properly disciplined; and properly whipped, now and then, before her frowardness had become established; or her bad temper, so very acrimonious, as it was, unless continually soothed and flattered, she might have been made into something like a superiour woman. I have seen her, when she was quite an interesting girl—for a single moment;—when the tears were starting into her eyes—and the blood was lighting up her fine forehead. And I have known her to say, not only some tart and pleasant, but some really witty things. The best part of her character, however, was her regard to the truth. She had a great deal of probity and moral courage; and she was the only one of the whole family, that had any at all; and, if she were actually in love—as I do believe that she might be—it would sweeten her temper, change her whole constitution, physical and intellectual; till, I dare say, she might hope to die a much happier woman, and a much fatter one. Her sister was rather pleasant and companionable. She would bleed at the heart, if she had hurt another, even by accident. But this one, without any evil disposition, would be very likely, if not awed at once, to carry a “stain away” upon her weapon, even while playing with it. I remember once having met with one of these good natured, credulous, unthinking women, like the other sister, who, when I had ended a sally of extravagance, in which I had been maintaining, that young terrapins, which the people of the country ate, sometimes, alive, were neither more nor less, than negro babies, with shells on. “O, Mr. Adams!” cried the girl, lifting her hands, and looking me innocently, up in the face—“how you talk! you will never make me believe that!” The elder of these daughters might have said the same thing, a few years before: and so might the younger—but if she had said it, so different would have been her tone, that you could never have mistaken it. It would have been witty in one—childish inattention, or surprise in the other. Next to her, was a beautiful child, who, the chief part of the evening, had kept her little eyes, upon the knotted joints; and rough, hairy skin; and ridgy nails of the Dwarf's hand, that lay upon the table near her. Nay—in the very heat of his discourse, while she was touching it, just as she would a pet toad—and whispering about it, to one of the ladies, Hammond let it lie there, just as if it had belonged to somebody else. Beside these, there was a woman, of whom I have already spoken, a proud masculine creature, with a powerful understanding, and full of high blood—independent and strong of thought; fearless and bitter.— She was called Miss or Mrs. E. I liked her afterward; I had many reasons for it; for she flattered me, continually; and flattery, from a strong minded woman of any age, though not very adroitly administered, is apt to lull the dragon of the worst heart.— But then—I did not like her—I would as soon have encountered a woman with mustachoes, as one that dared to say, to men, what I have heard her say to men; and what had she been a man, she would have been run through the body for. There was another; a French woman, with a plump, round, beautiful person—still youthful—graceful—spiritual—with a handsome face—remarkably intelligible eyes---lofty heart---familiar with the best society of the European courts; and at home, in her spirit of accommodation, wherever she was. And there were two gentlemen of the bar there; one a small man, with a pleasant, mild countenance; and a singularly chaste, amiable, and clear mind—modest, retiring, yet strong of heart and high of purpose; and another, the mortal antipathy of Miss E. a mild, pious, unassuming man, who, for his quiet unobtrusiveness, was prodigiously apt to be underrated. Such was the company that, before it was time to separate, for the night, had collected in the parlour. Mrs. Honey well, as I have already said, with a spiteful disposition to bring Hammond out, had begun to lavish her playfulness all about, like one flinging light and vapour from a censer. Hammond sat, thoughtfully, studying the countenance of the child, that I mentioned, as if, already, he could see her red lips blackening; her delicate transparency sullied, with the calamities of life:—the fierce light of his orbs, waned, quivered—and the lids filled; but, just then, his thought was forced back, by a violent convulsion, like one that starts broad awake, from a terrible dream, by the stopping of his own heart—just as if a ball had passed through it. “What was that?” said he, “that quotation.” Mrs. Honeywell had just been quoting a phrase that struck on his ear—even in its abstraction, like a knife. “The ravelled sleeve of care”—she answered. “The what!—pray, what do you mean by it?” “Mean! why it is Shakspeare, you know.” “I know no such thing, I assure you.” “What! you don't read Shakspeare, I suppose. You throw him aside, with the lumber and rubbish of old time —the classicks.” “No, pardon me; I do read Shakspeare; but I do not quote him; and I scorn to remember the trash even of Shakspeare. I cannot pardon, will not tolerate, nonsense in him.” “How dare you!—you!—you will not tolerate or pardon Shakspeare! Would that he might appear to you! he and Johnson, and Milton, and—.” “Would heaven (not would to heaven.) they might! Aye, that they sat there—there, upon that seat, at this moment—what! are you alarmed!—they would agree with me—they would say, that—” “Well done!—Why you would not dare to touch the hem of Shakspeare's garment—you!” vol. ii. F 2 “Would'nt I! I should tremble and sweat in his presence I suppose!—nonsense—William Shakspeake, himself, would laugh at our ridiculous, and indiscriminate enthusiasm;—aye, laugh at us, for our veneration of his nonsense. Do you believe that he would permit any one of his plays to survive his indignation, if he could hear it read, now?—No, he would trample them all in the dust.” “You dare not surely reprobate his plays?” “Dare I not? Listen to me. I dare to do more. I dare to say, and to prove it. I dare to give my reasons for it. I dare to say, that he never wrote a play, which would be tolerated upon the English stage, if it were to come out now; now, for the first time, from an unknown author?” “O, blasphemy! why have they been so worshipped. Why does he hold such sway over all our natures? Why is he so followed and imitated? Why has there never been such another genius since?” “Never such another genius!” “There is—there has been, many a one, his match, in genius: many, superior to him in dramatick talent— why worshipped? Because an army of commentators, criticks, and actors, have swarmed out of his corruption and fire; and become partakers in his immortality.” “His immortality! I thought that he had no genius.” “No—I have said no such thing. No human being had ever more genius than he; and none ever had more reverence, for his genius, than I have, It is that, which makes my blood boil, when I hear his name mentioned in this way. Shakspeare, himself, would be indignant at it. You would read him, as you acknowledged to me once, that you read the bible—through and through, again and again, from a sense of duty; though you “did not pretend to understand some of the chapters,” you said. Tut! You might as well have read it in the original Hebrew or Greek. Shakspeare is the god of the unthinking. His dramas, are their bible; his blundering ignorance, their unimpeachable gospel. He wrote without design; an uneducated, rash man; full of thunder and tempest; wind and flame; musick and brightness;—joying to emit them all, in his own way. He struck off his impressions at a blast; never believing in their value—never caring for them; beginning his dramas without any outline; too lazy to look back; or to read over; or remember, what he had once written; and therefore, blundering continually; but, even in his blundering—like a giant, stumbling over mountains— supplying his own forgetfulness, by violent and crowded incident, unnecessary characters, and setting at naught all the laws of the drama. Why? Not because he was above them; but because he was ignorant of them. Had it not been so, he would have outraged them, with a bolder hand; like one that crushes an enemy with his mailed foot, knowingly; or respected them —for they deserved it—to a certain extent. His mind was a treasury of precious things; musical instruments, shattered and broken; and coloured, brilliant, burning imagery; but all in disorder. Hence their rapidity, are splendour of his mental operations; they were perpetually revolving phenomena; a mental kaleidoscope, where the greater the disorder, the more multiplied, beautiful, and varied, are the combinations. But, all that he has done, is consecrated. By heaven, if the cursedest nonsense that was ever coined, had been trumpetted about, century after century, as his hath been; studied, all the while, by men whose only hope of immortality consisted, in finding, or imagining, some secret, deep intention, in his veriest gossipping, that all others had overlooked; it would be hallowed, at this moment, like his. O, how he would laugh, were he living now, at your veneration for parts, that never had any meaning in them!—parts, it is ten to one, taken from his loose manuscript—from scraps of paper, where he had merely tried his pen! How little of it would he endure at this moment! How much significance had been hunted out; how much spirit distilled; how much mysterious depth of meaning imagined, by actors and criticks! O, he would wonder at his own Hamlet, could he see it performed, at this hour!” “I have heard it said, that Garrick understood Shakspeare, better than Shakspeare understood himself,” said Mrs. H. “That would be nonsense, madam. Yet, I do not doubt, that the creatures of Shakspeare—his Richard, Othello, and Hamlet, for example—were utterly unlike the Richard, Othello, and Hamlet, of the stage. Every actor has his own conceptions of the part. It is for others, to say which is the best and truest. The original is only an apparition; and, it is likely, that he, who first called it up, by his tremendous sorcery, and taught it language, saw with as clear an eye, and as understanding a heart, what were its attributes, as they that have conjured it up, again and again, at second hand, by their baby incantations, out of book, till it has become an automaton, practised to move and talk, after a certain fashion, when regularly dressed, interrogated, set, and wound up.” “But Shakspeare, madam, like other men, has blinded himself, sometimes, by dashing too heedlessly among the stars. What think you? Is he an example for a dramatist? You speak of Garrick's veneration for him. Garrick has left the best proof, in the world, of his veneration, by the manner in which he has garbled every drama of Shakspeare's, that he touched. Not one of them, however, even yet, could a modest woman read aloud, in company; not one ought she to sit out, upon the stage; and yet it is the Bible of your libraries; nay, to be found, where no Bible is-to be found; ready, with its poison and death, for the unstained hand, and unpolluted breast, of every child; and so spoken of, that it is more terrible blasphemy, to speak as I have spoken of it, to-night, than so to speak of the Bible.” “What are our children to think of such things? Do you hope that they will pass over what shocks and thrills them—like brilliant little serpents, nestling, in the way to their bed room—upon their dressing tables —without any sensation, either of loathing or horrour, or fascination. Which is most likely? They are trained to regard Shakspeare, as the unapproachable one, whose web of rainbow and beauty, drenched with flame, and sprinkled with blood, is little else than the wayward, unsteady weaving, of one wasteful of his mate rials, and drunk with genius;—the great gossipping of one, whom, on account of his lonely beauty at one time; and passionate conception at another, we cannot reprobate, even when he deserves our united malediction. Your morality—shame on your independence!—shame too upon your decency!” “You wonder at my presumption—I can see that you do. You think that no such genius as Shakspeare hath ever lived. Yet, what did he?—look at his dramas— I can recollect but two, where there is one master passion, delineated with a steady eye, throughout. One is jealousy—Othello; and even there, we are not certain, that jealousy is the master passion—and the play is damnable—unnatural—beastly. Another is love—Romeo; and so utterly hath he failed there, that, to this hour, men are in doubt of the authorship. In all the others, there are compounded passions; a variety of characters; violent, ridiculous and huddled incidents, showing the labour of an inexperienced mind, ignorant of its own power---incapable of hoarding its riches--- lavishing, immediately, whatever came in his way, however fooolishly; lest, when he wanted, it might not be found,---and making up for his ignorance, by startling transitions---stage trick, indecency, buffoonery, and contradiction. Madam, you think that no man has written like Shakspeare. You are mistaken. You ask who ever wrote like him. I answer---nobody---or nobody but Ireland. Yet it were very easy. He did---a mere boy too---and succeeded so, that the criticks were cheated. I could do the same---I could write a play, that criticks would swallow for Shakspeare's.” “Hush! hush!”—said Mrs. Honeywell,—colouring to the eyes—with pity and consfernation— “I understand you,” continued Hammond—leaning toward her, and smiling,—“I am not mad—yet, I would undertake to write a play, in forty-eight hours —after I had got a few materials ready,—that should pass for Shakspeare's.” The tears almost filled her eyes. She was ashamed and terrified, at his earnestness; and, while she blushed, for him, to her very heart—she would have prevented him from exposing himself. But no—he repeated it. “You think that I am vain —I do not blame you. I do not wonder at it. Again and again, I have been told so. Yet, it does not change my opinion, one jot or tittle of myself. I know what I say. I believe that I could do it. I repeat it—though it pain you, to show you, that it was not said merely in the heat of contradiction. No—I have done with that. Yet—believe me, I thank you for your compassionate feeling. You would prevent me from making myself ridiculous. It was kind in you—and, though I have no fear that I could be so—in any case—still I thank you. Many persons have said to me, that I was mad—or insufferably presumptuous and vain; yet my own hear does not tell me so. If it did—or, rather, if it did not tell me that I was not mad, I should have discretion enough, I hope, to hold my tongue. There was one man---a very respectable man too, who was once civil enough to tell the publick, that something which I had written was full of “paltry egotism, and childish vanity.” That was very well. It was partly true—you know whom I mean—I could have lacerated him for it.” Mrs. Honeywell shook her head—rather emphatically. “Yes, I could!”—said Hammond, in a voice, that came from his heart—“and nothing saved him from it, but—my respect for his daughter, and the interference of Mr. Morton. You smile, madam. You wonder more at my vanity now, than ever. By heaven! I could have cut that man to the bones and marrow!” Her blue eyes were lighted up with fire---and her lips trembled. “No---no!---you could not---he is too great a man.” “A great man---he a great man!---O, no, he is an honest, respectable, decent sort of a good man---but far enough from being a great one.” “No---no---not to the marrow---not to the bone!” she repeated. “Aye---aye!” reiterated Hammond, evidently, I thought, to bring her to battle---“aye---and I could have shortened his life, great as he is---for ten years---I know it---I feel it---he knows it.” “You---you!”---repeated Mrs. Honeywell---the blood rushing over her forehead again---the veins all swelling; and her agitated hands rattling upon the table—do you know who he is, and what?” “Indeed I do not---who is he?” “A persecuted, good, and great man—I have seen.--” “I know what you would say. I have heard of it— some plate that his townsmen gave him.” “A man,” continued Mrs. Honeywell, that has educated his daughters—so—look at them---.” “Yes, Madam—there I agree with you. I respect him for that---but he is not a great man---nevertheless; and pray, now that we are upon the theme, how know you, that he is so good a man?” “I have known him for ten years.” “Well, does that prove that he was good, before you knew him?” “No---but I have heard his history.” “From whom?---from himself, I suppose---or from his daughters?” “No---from others.” “Ah!---from others then, that---how know you, that they did not have it from him, or his daughters?”— “Pray tell me, plainly—do not let it disturb you— I do not mean to injure him.” “Well!” “Have you ever inquired of strangers about him?— his early life?---his character?---at home?” “No---why should I inquire? I knew him---have known him and his family, for ten years. No---I would not listen to anything against him---I would not believe it---I—” “Is that prudent?—is it wise?” “I care not whether it be prudent or wise---I speak from feeling. I will not hear him slandered.” “But how can you love one, without knowing him fully?---ten years, twenty years are not enough for this ---a man may be honest all his life---and a scoundrel at the last hour. One fact will prove a man to be a villain; thousands and thousands will not prove him to be honest. How know you that he did not leave his country---perhaps---“for his country's good”---suppose that some one should come to you, and tell you that I see that you are excited---that he—.” “I will not hear you. No man shall speak disrespectfully of him, in my presence.” “I like your spirit,—your feeling—your generosity. But is it prudent? Would he thank you for it—would I?—you have never inquired. Why?—because you were satisfied. But what right had you to be satisfied when you had heard only one side?---You would not listen to the other. Had your dearest friend come to you, and said---that man is a scoundrel---I have heard ---that—” “Yes---yes,” said Miss E—, moving forward eagerly---“I have heard too---that is charming---is'nt it Mrs. Monette?---what a treat it is!” “No”---said Hammond proudly---“I know nothing at all against the man. I spoke of him, accidentally, merely because he had been severe upon me---not in revenge, I am sure; for, had I been revengeful, there were other ways to punish him. He was utterly in my power. You smile, madam. Let me give you one instance, among many. I had said that, we, in America, had no names except Washington's, worthy of poetry. He took it up; and, with a great waste of fuel, began to ask, what!---have we no Franklin's, no Jefferson's! No Adam's, &amp;c. Bless his heart!---I had been speaking of names---and had even italicised the word, that I might not be mistaken; and all the fuss that he was making---whizzing and whirring, like soap suds in a gutter---was about men. That was one instance. I could name others: but---I respect the man. He paid me some compliments---but they did'nt go to the right place---he did'nt feel, he could not feel what I had written; and, therefore, his praise was worse than his condemnation.” “But Shakspeare! Shakspeare!” said Miss E. edging in. “In one moment,” said Mrs. Honeywell. “You have had a severe trial,” said Hammond, hobbling out his chair, and offering her his ugly claw— “a very severe one: but you ought to thank me for it--you were never so eloquent; and, as I told you—your unwillingness to hear me open my lips against your friend, looked suspicious. Had you been half so sure, as you pretend to be, you would have dared me to tell, all that I had known, or heard--instead of preventing me.” “O no---of what use would it be: it would only make me unhappy. There is evil enough about us. All the world are too ready, now, to hearken to, and repeat it.” “For that reason, I would have my friend listen to it, were I in a like situation. It would enable her to vindicate me, with knowledge, as well as zeal. The innocent grow brighter in the very trial, and scrutiny, that destroy guilt. I thank nobody for such inprovident confidence in me. If you have aught against me—tell me of it; make me answer to it. What mean your eyes. You have heard something against me. Tell me, plainly, before all these people---tell me; or you are not my friend.” Mrs. Honeywell smiled---a quick glance passed like an electrick spark between her and one of the ladies. I turned, and Hammond repeated the question. “Why---what is the meaning of this?” said he, “you look distressed.” As he said this, his eye flashed upon the distant white wall---when---Oh! it must have been terrible! he saw what had caused their meriment and confusion. They were looking at his shadow;---the unsightly blackness was like a plastered devil, upon the white wall opposite---and a large pointer, upon the rug, lay eyeing it, with strong symptoms of terrour. All eyes were turned toward it. And the room was silent as death. Hammond set his teeth---his eyes dilated---his lips writhed---he put his locked hands to his forehead, for a moment---a mortal paleness followed---the disorder of his heart was soon gone---his lips parted, and quivered---and, when he took down his hands, there was a melancholy lustre, as of a noble nature, outraged to tears, under the lashes. VOL. II. G Elizabeth, I perceived, had retired behind her beautiful neighbour, and I could not well see her face; but, I observed that her hands, which I could see, were agitated, in her lap. “You had been kinder, Madam,” said he, in a lower tone, and with an altered front---all its lordliness had gone---he stood, like a broken hearted man---“had you been more sincere. I forget myself. I do not blame you for laughing at, or quaking before the horrible shadow. If it were the shadow of anything that God had not made---and breathed his divinity into, I should laugh, too. But, I cannot mock at his doing---and I will not weep, while I, alone, am the sufferer. You had done better; it would have been worthier of your gentleness and humanity, at first, to tell the truth---the shock would have been less humiliating and sudden.” There was a pause; and not a breath could be heard; yet I thought that there was the sound—very faintly— of some one, sobbing—I dared not move—I dared not inquire who it was—but I had my suspicion—and I grew faint with it. “Yet, this is not the first time—no, not the first, that the distorted shadow of one, made, it hath been bitterly said of me, in the image of God Almighty—hath been the cause of distress, or merriment, among brave hearts; and once, it left me bloody—bloody! I have not yet atoned for it—I—I am naturally kind of heart —but, there was a child too; a lovely child, that I so frighted once, as to make its mother hate me. She was like that one—I strove hard against my nature, and with the devil here, not to strangle them both, for it.” Another pause—it was yet more terrible. The room was getting dark—the lamp waned—and there was nobody to remember why. All looked, as if they thought it preternatural. “I do not wonder,” continued Hammond, with a voice, like one parleying with a spirit, at his very elbow. “I do not wonder, that Richard was a devil— that Lord Byron is a devil—but O, (clasping his hands, together; and wringing them, till the joints cracked) Merciful Father!—let me not live to be a third—let me live to overcome the demon!—to digest the bitterness of my own heart—to forget this inward scalding.” He then went to Mrs. Honeywell, whose face was buried in her hands. “Come, Madam, come—it is all over now. The cut went to my heart—but, it was the cut of a sharp knife—rather deep, than painful; one word more, however. You are wrong, not to listen to both sides, where a friend is concerned. Tell me, will you—what it is that you have heard of me? “Do you insist upon it?—here?” said Mrs. Honeywell. “Yes, Madam. Really, it is a poor compliment— this hesitation. It shows that you have some doubt.” “Oh, no—not at all.” “I beg your pardon. If you had no doubt of my innocence, you would mention the report, fearlessly; whatever it were.” “Were you ever acquainted with a Captain Seyton?” Hammond started—was silent for a moment, as if struck with a sudden pain—and then answered. “Yes.—I shot him.” “In a duel?” “Yes.” “Not in a duel!---Hammond—Mr. Hammond! I would say;” said Elizabeth, with a faint cry. “Yes—in a duel. Hereafter, I will tell you how it happened, that I was so wicked, and foolish.” “Well, well—never mind the duel—let us hear the argument finished”—said Mrs. E. “It is the greatest treat in the world, to me, to hear you and Mrs. Honeywell converse. Let it be finished.” “Yes—so I say—let it be finished—” said Mrs. Honeywell, laughing. “Renewed; you mean, Miss E—. said the younger daughter; “arguments are never finished.” The oldest daughter here rubbed her eyes—and one of the lawyers left the room. “Yes—I am willing to finish it, I assure you; for, I am anxious to convince you—and I am sure that I could,” said Hammond, to Mrs. Honeywell. “Convince me! of what? that I ought to hear my friend slandered? No—never—never!” “Madam—I do assure you, that I could—nay—I will—if you will listen to me, for five minutes.” “What! if I were a wife, I suppose that you would come to me, and tell me all that my husband had ever done—and break my heart—and—.” “Yes!—Yes!—Yes!—If you were my sister—and he had been scoundrel enough not to tell you! Yes!—Yes! if I heard a slander, that I knew to be false, I would tell you of it—that you might not hear it from another; if true, that you might profit by it.” “Yes—and destroy my confidence in my husband— set me, as a spy upon his action; fill my heart, with distrust and apprehension! O, these are the people, that drug the cup of heaven, with death!” “Beautifully said, Madam; but, hear me, for one moment. Our attachments, to be valuable, must be the growth of knowledge. Is it not so?” “How?” “I mean, that they should be founded upon examination, study and enquiry. It is our duty to know our whole nature, if we can, before we are intimate, in any degree. But your doctrine would lead you to shut your eyes against the dearest friend on earth, though he should come to you, and say. You are intimate with Mr. A. or Mr. B. You believe him to be a good man. You are deceived.” “I would not listen to him.” “I would, upon my honour---very patiently---though it were uttered against the dearest friend that I have, on this earth.” “You would!” said Miss E. “Yes---and I would then go to my friend, and tell him what I had heard---show my confidence in him, by giving him an opportunity to vindicate himself; search into the truth of the whole matter; never rest, till I came to the bottom of it; that done, if I found it true, though it cost me my own life, I would go and thank the man; nay, if it were false, and he, who had set me upon the track, had acted with a manly, or innocent feeling, I would still thank him; and put it into his power to contradict it; but, if it were coinage of his own; malicious or vindictive---wo to him---wo to him, though he were my own brother. But you, Madam, you would not listen to him.” “You, yourself would not. I am sure of it.” “No—you would not, perhaps, if the person were addressing your daughter.” “O, that would be a different affair.” “Or yourself!” “Why, in such matters—they are extreme cases! I might be willing to listen.” “You ought to be, in all cases. Who knows what would become of us, if we followed your doctrine, even in the common intercourse of life? What would console you, if, after you had refused to listen to a friend, you should find that some villain had been, for years, the companion of yourself and children? No—do your duty—be cautious, circumspect, and distrustful; if you would make your good opinion valuable. Do your duty; and, whatever happen, you will be happy. I say to you, as I did to Mr. Hull—when he came to employ me, in behalf of his son, who was afterwards hanged. You cannot save him, said I. You must not expect it. But, do your duty; leave no stone unturned. You will be happier then, though he be hanged, than you would be, if he were pardoned; and you had neglected anything, to procure his pardon. In the first place, a consciousness of having done your utmost, would sustain you; in the latter, your heart would reproach you, for ever, with having hazarded your child's life, by your omission.” “But, let us examine the business, fairly. If you were married, would you, or would you not listen?” “O, then,” said she, tenderly, passionately, like one that had suffered; “I would be ignorant. “Where ignorance is bliss, 'twere folly to be wise;” you know.” “I commend your recollection, my dear Madam; but ignorance never is bliss. And why might not one tell you of any hidden evil, in your husband's nature— any—.” VOL. II. G 2 “What good could it do?” “Much—I can imagine many cases. “No, no! It is impossible. You never shall convince me.” “Madam;” said Hammond, leaning toward her, his large, black, glittering eyes rivetted upon her; and his hand thrust into his bosom, up to the elbow, as into hot embers, in search of his own heart. “Madam!---I can convince you. I will!” “Suppose that your husband had been intemperate, in his youth---a madman; and that a glass of wine would drive him again. to fury; suppose that you knew it not; that he had kept the secret; and that you had wondered, for many years, at his abstinence, but never knew the cause; that you had, for it might well be, in the festivity of your heart, determined to make him overcome his dislike to it, though you were obliged to mingle the wine with his food. Suppose then---then! Madam, that some friend, who knew your husband's infirmity--knew that it was a secret, to all the world, but the sufferer and himself, should come to you; and lay his hand upon yours, and cry out “beware! would you put poison into his cup?” How would you bless him! It might save you, and your little ones.” “Yes!---and make me die, ten thousand deaths, by apprehension—set me to watching every movement of his countenance—every tone of his voice—in the horrible thought of madness.” “Nay; but it would enable you to aid him, in his self-denial: to spare him the agony of explanation—to sustain him, under temptation, and trial—and to prevent others from playing, as you were about to play with his life---and soul!” “Yes---but it would kill me:---it might prolong his life---but I should die of a broken heart, frighted away from him.” “And what death would be so welcome to an affectionate and devoted wife?---to die in preserving his life ---to—” “She was silent---and her deep eyes were clouded with passionate emotion:---and Hammond continued, in a voice of such unutterable pathos, depth and mournfulnesss, that, when he had done---we all drew one long breath together---and were silent for many minutes. “Suppose another case”---said he. “You are married, and happy, beyond the lot of women. Yet---and you know it---there is a terrible, untold calamity, in the life of your husband, upon which it is not lawful to speak. No matter how you have come to suspect this. You know not what it is---but---when the sea roars--- and the wind blows---and the rain beats---or the noise of shipwreck---and the cry of drowning people are told of ---you see his forehead work---and the sweat coming out of it. Would you not bless the man---kneel down, and bless him---who would come to you, and say— “Lady---beware how you talk of sudden death---or of drifting bodies--or of the wild sea breaking, in wrath, upon the wind,---for your husband once lost the dearest things on earth to him---a wife and child!--by shipwreck ---and went mad upon the spot. He loves you---hath always loved you, to distraction---but he dared not tell you this, lest it should drive you mad.” Would you not bless him! You yield. I knew that you would. You are always right, when you permit yourself to think. I would risk my right hand, that I can bring you to agree with me, where—bless my soul!—I had no idea that it was so late.” “Yes”—said Mrs. Honeywell—“but—you will give up, about Shakspeare?” “What—about that nonsense which you quoted.— What was it?—repeat it, will you?”— “I forget how he brings it in—but the thought is beautiful—he speaks of knitting up the ravelled sleeve of care.” “And what idea have you of it?”—said Hammond. She began to explain, but he interrupted her. “No—I never saw it before—and if you did not assure me, that it was in Shakspeare, I would deny it—I would swear that such intolerable trash could not be his. I wonder at you. It is a confused, ill-managed, laboured conceit. Why not say, sew up the scarlet elbow of care— or new cover the buttons—or try-out the cuff. There is no fitness in the thought. You laugh. But, upon my honour, I can see no difference between them—it is the—I beg your pardon—but no other word will express it—it is about the damnedest nonsense in the world.” There was a general shock—as if a thunderbolt had exploded in the ceiling—and his voice were a trumpet call. “But it is Shakspeare; and that is enough. I remember once travelling through Boston, and meeting with a paper, called the Centinel, in which some fool or other—I don't mean the Editor—had hit upon a new reading in Shakspeare. You remember where Hamlet meets his mother, and compares the pictures. Hamlet is speaking of the usurper, who, like a thief, “the precious diadem stole—and put it in his pocket.” Now, said the critick, the words in italick are only a stage direction—which, in transcribing, came to be incorporated with the text—and mean that Hamlet puts the picture into his pocket! “What!” he cries—“a diadem to be put in a king's pocket—What a pocket his majesty must have!” It was in a friend's counting room, that I saw it;—and, so indignant was I, that it was for some minutes a question with me, whether I should break into the Editor's house, and curse him for his stupidity, in admitting such a criticism, or reply to it. But I resolved on the latter—and there, as I stood, scribbled a few lines, on two or three scraps of execrable paper: and put them, with my own hands, into the box, as I went by. They were published. The blockheads!—They knew not, what they ought to have known---before they presumed to approach Shakspeare, except, upon their naked hands and feet—that till John Kemble's time, that part was always played with two portraits, hanging side by side—of the two kings;—as if the murderer could abide the painted spectre of the dead monarch—or his incestuous queen, the awful reproach of his lifeless shadow—perpetually smiling upon her, it may be, even while she was in the arms of his murderer. It would have been, to the full, as easy, one would think, to put the diadem in a pocket, as one of the portraits—and quite as natural. “But again—the ghost appears---and then, if the critick be right, Hamlet is directed to put the picture into his pocket, before he takes his position—his attitude of horrour. By heaven! it were about as rational to give a stage direction to Hamlet thus— Ham—“the precious diadem stole. “And— (Ghost enters---Hamlet blows his nose) as to give it in the manner that the critick requires which is this--- Ham— “the precious diadem stole, “And— (Ghost enters---Hamlet puts the picture in his pocket.) “But what meant Shakspeare—Shakspeare! the anointed one! He meant this---and none but a commentator, a critick; or an Editor---could have misunderstood it. He meant that the scoundrel king stole the crown, like a shop-lifter, from the “majesty of buried Denmark” that he did not conquer it!--in harness and steel--blood and dust. But---heaven forgive me!”---he added, halting toward the French lady---who sat mute with astonishment;---for he had not permitted a living creature to open his lips, that evening.” “Ah madame, Je vous demande pardon,” said he---- “Pardon!---pourquoi?”---she replied. He touched his lips---and she understood him---for she smiled, wickedly, and added---now! I vill-zay to you, Mr. Hammon, vat-zat zee queen say---zee queen Elizabess---she-zay to zee ladee zat haf not gif, to er zee jewail---how you say zat?---zee bague.” “O, the ring,” said Hammond, bowing---“I wait the report---this battle of the eyes over; it is a part of your duty to give in the killed and wounded---but what said Elizabeth?” “O,----zee ladee haf-keep zee jewail----Monsieur Hammon---cést egal; vous avez fait la même chose you haf keep ze jewail.” “O, ho!”---said Mrs. Honeywell, tapping Hammond on the arm,---“I understand the drift---you have given us words, and kept the jewelry to yourself.” “Throwing pearls before—ahem—” said her younger daughter---colouring at the sound of her own voice. “Hush---hush!”---answered the mother---“well what did the queen say---madame?” “O, she-say----Dieu peut vous pardonner----mais, moi!---Je ne vous pardonnerai jamais!” “Bravo!” cried the elder daughter, laughing outright, till her large blue eyes ran over, “bravo!” Mr. Hammond, I think you have got the bague now.” Note by Editor. There can be no doubt, I think, that the author has introduced this page, for no purpose in the world, but, as an excuse for repeating a few words of French, which, it is highly probable, that he does not understand. I have met with such things before. There is a Spanish phrase in Logan, taken from Gil Blas, “a dios amado, &amp;c”—and another line or two of Italian, from Goldoni, which is the motto of the first chapter. Shame on such childish pedantry!—Ed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Hammond's life...Duel...Elizabeth...The Church...Reflections ...Merchandise...Failure...Character of partners...Persecution...Trials...Mr. G....Mr T...Sundry encounters.” “Pray,” said I, as soon as we were sufficiently alone together—it was a week after this conversation, that is related in the preceding chapter—“Pray Hammond, tell me about the duel.” “Which one?” “Which one! were there more than one?” “Yes—I have been well nigh. engaged in four or five; but never actually in the field, but once—for which, I pray God, to forgive me.” “What! that you have never been in the field but once?” “No—that I have ever been out, at all.” “Did you kill your man?” “Yes.” “On the spot?” “No—he lived three years afterwards—went to sea for his health, and died.” “And how do you feel about it?” “Feel!—so help me God! that it had been better for me, had I been killed upon the spot.” As he said this, he thrust out his long arms, at their full length before him; and shut his eyes, with such a look of unutterable desolation, that I felt my blood run cold. Surely, thought I, the dead body must have passed at that moment; and he must have felt it. There was a silence of some minutes, that I was truly afraid to interrupt. But it grew insupportable, at at last; and I made some noise with my feet. He heeded it not—stirred not—but his shut eyes were quivering in the sockets—the water oozing and trickling, drop by drop, from under the heavy lids, down to his mouth, while all the rest of his face was immoveable, and pale as marble. It was terrifick. “Hammond!” I cried, in unaffected alarm. “Fire!” he answered, instantly—uncovering his breast, as if to receive a shot.” “Hammond! Hammond!” I cried, again. He opened his eyes—they were blood shot—saw me—started up—and instantly recollected himself. “Tell me how it happened;” said I. “Be patient,” he replied. “Bear with me. Let me walk a few minutes. I have much to tell. It is not a proper time. I would have you know all about me; and tomorrow night—if you are better not employed, I—.” “Tomorrow night, be it, then,” said I. After that, he sat down again; and we chattered away the best part of the evening together; and a part of the next day, in a most pleasant and sociable manner. But, on the night, agreed upon, when I entered the room, I saw that he had been writing—his features were pale and stiff. “You should know all, that you may be prepared for whatever may happen. But I shall expect the same confidence from you.” “You will be disappointed,” said I. “No human being shall ever know how I have passed nearly one year of my life; or where. I have no disposition to conceal the fact that, there is blood upon my hands too:—blood, less innocently shed than yours—but where---and when, and why shed, I cannot tell. Three years of my life, are dark to me; so dark, that I dare not approach them in thought. There was a black ocean about me, then ---another being and I, passed each other; like two privateers---at night---in a gale of wind. There were shrieks---and fire---and smoke---and a cannonading, or something like it---it might have been thunder.--- And, when I was fully myself again, there was the smell of blood, fresh blood about me; on my hair; upon my clothes; upon my hands! O Christ! I cannot, cannot go on. That is all that you will ever know. It is nearly all that I, myself know. Are you satisfied with it?” “No.” “It was revenge, perhaps?” “No matter.” “Jealousy?” “Aye---jealousy, perhaps.—” “Was it the blood of innocence—?” “No matter. It shall not be told. I know not. He shook my hands, and turned away his face. “I know not,” said he, “why I have undertaken to judge you. There is One, that hath authority. We have both sinned; I, probably, with the least excuse, for jealousy never shook my heart---never will.---Of whom, can such a creature as I, be jealous? Three years! you say---that cannot be---there is not more than one year in all, in which I have lost sight of you; and the longest period, where there are no certain traces of you, is about only eight or ten weeks. But no matter. Both of us are red transgressors.---Let us repent. Let us be compassionate to each other; and, now that the world are willing to let us alone, guilty that we are, let us be wary, for the future; and repent betimes. In one word---Let us be good. What say you.” We embraced; and I wept upon his bosom---What was there, in his strange voice, that so mastered me? I could not resist it. It was like the wizard summoning of one, that looks into a cavern, haunted with unclean spirits, and brave princely creatures, and bids them separate and come forth. Mine obeyed him; and my hear tfelt warmer, cleare, once rid of the pestilent warring tenantry. “Are you ready for the tale?” “All ready,” said I, throwing myself back into the most comfortable chair, that I ever sat in—flinging one leg over a pile of books, at my right hand; and resting the other upon a high fender---willing to make myself at home. “Well---you know something of the difficulty, that I had to encounter in my boy-hood; and enough of what passed, till you disappeared. Soon after that, I began to hear you spoken of, sometimes with affection; often, as one capable of great things: and I began to learn that, if one would know his own strength, he must go abroad. We cannot learn to swim upon a table. We must go among the breakers. A man may stand forever vol. ii. H upon a precipice, if he trust to nothing but his own limbs. But, if he rely upon a cobweb, in any degree; and it should snap,---he is gone!” “I determined to go abroad; to seek you, if I could, my friend. Elizab---your sister—had taught me the value of my faculties. I began to study her character, before I did yours;---for I considered you as a petulant idiot, particularly after you half strangled your uncle, and blew up his boys with gunpowder. But your sister, I could study for ever—and she taught me to know you better. As we grew older, my respect for her became awful---it was religious---the duel was on her account. She does not know it---and I would not have her know it. It is a secret to all but you. Let it remain so. You know that she is resolved never to marry. I am sorry for it—for she cannot live so long as I—and I should love to toil for her children, when she is in her grave. Such a woman---that will not marry---from loftiness of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and genuine independence, ought to be set up for men to wonder at.” “I have always loved to hear the name of Elizabeth spoken reverently; and, particularly, when it was by them that had power and beauty of mind enough, to understand her; enough of that strange affinity, which nature has established, between creatures of the same rank; yet here was a man that could understand her—a man of exceeding potency, and very honest, speaking of her, in the language that I most loved to hear; yet—yet— I cannot deny it; the swell of my heart was unlike any that I had ever felt before, when Elizabeth was praised; it was bitter, painful, and sorrowful—alarming: I would have asked him to tell me why—; but I dared not; and I know not whether he observed any alteration in my countenance or not, for he continued, much in the same tone, to relate to me. the following particulars of his life. I was amazed at the resemblance in a part of our history, and disposition. Yet, his had been the less calamitous, and the less varied life; and his, the nobler, and more patient temper. I felt it; and what I feel, I am always ready to acknowledge. His rebuking went home to my heart; and, when he had done, I do confess to you, that I felt ashamed of many things, in my life, upon which, till then, I had been accustomed to look only with a feeling of complacency; and, sometimes, of exultation. But no—he dashed them to the earth—laughed at me—quelled me, and taught me, ere he had well done, that to be, in any degree great, is to be good. He did not teach—what is not true—that there is any irretrievable or unpardonable sin, either before God and his angels, or before men;—but he did teach, what is true, that blackness and death are, for ever, upon that part of the soul, where transgression hath but once, and for a single moment, laid her burning hand; that Repentance, and Contrition, and Sorrow, may pour their oil and wine into the bruised heart, or the broken forehead—but that, for ever and ever, the scar will remain, and the agony of remembrance. He did not teach, for he was wise and honest, that one may not be the mightier in his uprising, who hath suffered longest under the accumulation of evil—: nor that one, who stumbles, and yet touches not the earth, or touches it, if he touch it, like Antæus, for renovation and invulnerability, may not, thereby, exhibit to the world, powers that, if he had not stumbled; or had gone steadily along the precipices of life, had never been developed or suspected—no!—but he taught that, to stumble at all—upon any precipice, is putting your immortal soul, unpreparedly, at hazard. “You know,” said he, “that I went behind a counter, just about the same time that you did; but, it was never after my taste. It appeared to me dishonourable, for men to take upon themselves a business, so entirely fitted, as retailing, for the support of helpless women, widows, and orphans; and so much easier, more profitable, and more respectable for them, than the occupations, to which they are generally driven, by the men that have monopolized their trade. Commonly, when a woman is left destitute upon the world, she is obliged to keep a school, or to take boarders[4] [4] Or gin—Ed. —neither of which will leave her a provision for her old age, or permit to her the commonest enjoyment of life. I soon became weary of the business; and thought of some profession. I looked about me; but I was friendless and destitute. The church had its temptation; but how was I to disinthral myself from the world?—how, to become initiated. I was neither abject, dastardly, nor willing to go apprentice to any man's religious opinion, as to a trade, I say apprenticeship, because, it is one. How happens it, that the pupils preach the same doctrine, when they set up for themselves, that their masters taught? Can it be conviction? Is it likely to be?—No! When a father wishes to make a minister of his boy, he always put him to learn the trade of some person, who thinks as he does; or whose mode of thinking is fashionable and profitable. What is he then, but an apprentice? Where, then, was I to find a man, who would educate me; converse with me; reason with me; and when he had done, leave me utterly to God, and to my own understanding, for my choice of religion? Or where was I to find a theological seminary, where I could be educated, in any way,—even by sweeping the rooms, and waiting upon the table, of my fellow students—running their errands, and abiding their jeers and taunting, meekly—from which, or from the creed of which, when I was ready to go out into the world, if I ventured to dissent—where was there one that would license me?— one that would not brand me as an apostate? Ah, my friend, (let me begin to call you so) I had such dreams! Could I have but set my foot within the church— though there were no college of Jesus; no Jesuits about me—no bishops, nor archbishops; cardinals, nor popes, within the reach and scope of my ambition, I do feel assured—assured—William Adams, that the Dwarf would have wrought powerfully among the nations; and left a name behind him, that would not readily have been forgotten—” “But no. This career was not for me. The church was walled round with triple brass to me. I had no rich friends; was no fawning beggar—; could neither sell myself to this congregation, nor to that—; nor to any missionary society; and so---I was fain to abandon that hope. In time, there were people, who affected to understand my heart; but they deceived themselves. They granted that my doctrines were those of morality;—but,---and I never pretended that they were; that they were not those of religion. No sect claimed me---there was no communion for me---, no creed. Why? Let me lay bare the secret. That only, was religion, to every man, you know, which every man followed as his. The rest was heresy. Of course, as I followed the religion of no one---blessing my God, that he had given me some understanding, and some wisdom; and praying for more---to all, I was a heretick.” “Successively, I traversed in thought, most of the trades and professions of men; and, at last, weary of the search, yet heaving, continually, after dominion, I sat myself down, patiently, unweariedly, to what I regarded as my duty; and, as I saw no prospect of being either a lawyer, soldier, actor, physician or divine, I determined to be, though it should take me half a century, a great merchant. I knew that the name was honourable; the power great; and, that he, who was only a great merchant, was on a level with kings—nay, with statesmen.” “But how was this to be achieved; I was pennyless; and my spirit had been hampered, and subdued from its capacity and elevation, by the mercentary, paltry trifling, of a retail shop. Yet---it is my nature, never to despair—nay, never to despond. I knew that the greatest men have arisen from the smallest beginning;---that the largest fortunes are but a combination of cents---the ocean, of drops.” “And, while these thoughts were working within me, I met a young man, unlike me in every respect; but well enough for my purpose---(I only wanted him for a stepping stone)---who pretended that he had money and friends. These, I knew, were the true mechanical powers of life. With them, you may heave a world, without troubling yourself for a place to establish your machinery upon. My first movement, was to “buy out,” as it is called, “the stock” of an experienced shopkeeper; in other words, to purchase at any price, the accumulated vol. ii. H 2 refuse and rubbish of a whole generation, merely to get what was called a good stand, in a country town. My proposals were very distinct: the terms were acceded to; but the stock, which, we had been told, would amount to only three or four thousand dollars, we found fast approximating to ten or twelve. This was not to be born---I had no idea of selling myself, wrist and ancle, for life, to vend old goods---; and, as the best way of backing out of the agreement,---I electioneered so, as to make the owner insist for his ultimatum, upon a security, that we could not possibly give! This concluded the negotiation; and the store, owner and goods got the benefit of a dusting, and re-arrangement, which all wanted;---and I, lighter of heart by a whole world, leaped about, for a month, like a galley slave set unexpectedly at liberty, by a thunder clap; or some miraculous melting, or sundering of his chains.” “After this, I continued my way, lumbering along the great turnpike of life, until I found myself doing business a while, on a very respectable scale, in New York; and soon after, in a more diminutive, but very productive one, in Boston; and then, in a city of the south.” “It would be idle to dwell upon any of these intermediate stages of my life; and, therefore, I will take you, at once, into the hurry, and bustle, and distraction, of that, which shipwrecked me. It was in a southern, city. I need not tell you where; but, with one clerk, I will venture to say that I made more money, honestly, in a few months, than was made by any three warehouses in the city, during the same time; though some of them had an army of clerks and household troops. But then, there were vicissitudes. I had become associated with two other men—men, to whom, I am willing to confess, that I owe everything that is dear to me---in business. One was an adventurous fellow, understanding better the ways and means of financiering, than any human creature, I believe, except Law, the projector of the Mississippi scheme; yet credulous, beyond belief; a being, who never gave himself any other trouble in life, than to sell as many goods as he could, at as large a profit as he could—for anybody's note; it mattered not much, whose; the other, a high minded man; and I then thought, of more inflexible integrity, strength of character, genuine, unadulterated feeling---than any other, that I have ever known. Not two men could have been worse fashioned for sober merchandising. The one was literally a commercial gambler; the other, ignorant, beyond belief, of all the paltry tricking and detail of trade; who had been educated to another profession; in which, one day, he would have stood, almost alone; but God had laid his visiting hand upon him, and broke him down, utterly, in all, but the integrity of his heart. He had his share of business, in his own profession; but, when he got hold upon it, sickness came upon him; and he was put back, a whole season; for a time too, that, in the outset of our career, is irretrievable. But he renewed the trial; and persisted, till his little property was dissipated---and clouds were about him---and his great heart was heavy---nay, till there were bidders for him, and his conscience---till men thought to buy, even his political integrity.” “The man who became his partner and mine, afterward, saw the struggle, and dealt plainly with him. “Come to me;” said he; “enter into partnership, with me. I do not ask you to meddle with the business. You can keep the books; and sign checks and notes; and play the gentleman, when necessary; and write letters for the house; eat dinners; and that will be all that I shall ask.” “It was a struggle of life and death to him---it was selling his birthright---his title to immortality, for so much trash as may be grasped thus; but the bread— the bread, that his wife and babe were to feed upon— could be bought, only with that trash; and that could he had, only by subjection to men that would just feed him for his musick; or, by accepting this proposal. He accepted of the latter; and, it was soon after the union of these two men, that I met with them; and was, in one way and another, put into business[5] [5] Yes, faith—so it appears—and a pretty business it was too, that they got him into.—Ed. by them. I was sent to the south, as I have told you, with letters; among which, was one, to a scurvy old gentleman, of whom I shall have occasion, soon, to speak, more particularly, as the most unrelenting, pitiless, iron-handed man, that ever wrung the blood out of a human heart.” “My business was exceedingly prosperous; and I soon persuaded my partners to join me, where I was established. But, here began our reverses. We were three; and, when a question was to be decided, between me and the financier, it was sure to be decided by our partner, against me. The consequence was, that we speculated too largely—our goods were detained at sea, an unprecedented time—the season for business passed away—and we were left, to pay for our purchases, out of the reluctant proceeds of a tremendous stock, rapidly declining. Our exertions were desperate. We had two large, wholesale stores, open; and we immediately established two others, for retailing; careful, at the same time, like all persons in similar circumstances, to crowd off all that we could, of our stock, upon every tolerable pretence of security; selling to such as were recommended to us, by our neighbours; forgetful that such a recommendation ought always to startle us; if the person recommended be a debtor of the one that recommends.” “We had to renew our notes---as we could---giving such security as we could; and lugging in, as men always do, when they are drowning, all those who are foolish enough in their friendship, to venture within their reach. It is true, that we believed our concern solvent to a large amount, notwithstanding all our losses;---but, we did not know it; and were, therefore, guilty of embarrassing our best friends.” “At last, the spring opened; and we strained, like men heaving for their lives, to throw off the burden that was leaning upon us; and the better to assist us, in disposing of an old stock, we sent to Philadelphia for a small quantity of fresh goods. The scheme was well; and a partner (the adventurer) carried it into effect. But while he was gone, I had rather an ugly process of examination gone through with; and the re sult was, that I found we were ruined;---and, as honest men, could not go on, any longer. He returned; and, that night, we never shut our eyes. He was thunderstruck, at what I told him.” “What would be said of us?” said he---“These late purchases of ours will look villainously black. All our desperate exertions will be regarded as deliberate villany, to get what we could, into our hands, before we failed.” “We must submit to the imputation, for awhile,” said I. “But our duty is plain. The goods must all be sent back.” “But a part are already sold.” “Then let us send back what are not sold---and permit the creditor to choose from our stock, for the deficiency.” That was agreed to:---yet---it is a pity that such things should not be known!---there was a man, in Philadelphia, of whom we had purchased largely; and to whose agent, we had returned the goods, in this way; yet he has persecuted us, ever since, with a more deadly and unsparing malignity, for the amount of a few dollars, that had been taken out and sold, before I had come to a determination to return them, than any other human being.[6] [6] I am requested to add—that the Philadelphian was named Richard Milre—a man that has the reputation of never having forgotten, or forgiven any debt—of any kind. There was a house too, in New-York—Bulkley and Butler—of the same amiable, humane temper—with fine prospects before them—in this world and the next: —and one, in Baltimore, named—but no matter for the name—a misfortune has fallen upon them all, and the persecutor is forgiven, for the sake of his children, cruel and bitter as was the persecution. We had a hundred other trials to endure. Like other men, full of blood and confidence, from whose hands the cup is not entirely wrenched, we were willing to make some terms, before we capitulated. We talked with our friends;---and, particularly, with a testy old gentleman, named Galligan, who complained a good deal afterward, about my ingratitude, of which I shall soon give you a notion;---and the result was, that he advised me to pay such of our creditors, as were frightened, in goods; with a wink o' the eye, that said plainer than words could have said it---“frighten 'em first; and then nab 'em.” “This old man was the first to give me this advice--- “Pay 'em,” said he, “if they're frightened, pay 'em!--- You know, my boy, you know---tell 'em you're the boy what buys goods o' me---make 'em pay.” At the same time, he took notes, as security for his debt, knowing that, if they were to be sold at auction, they would bring much more, than the same amount of goods, unseasonable and tremendously charged as ours were. I mention these things, dear Adams, because I would have you understand something, of what you may expect, if you should ever be shipwrecked, or burnt out: and, briefly, that I may come the sooner to a more interesting part of my life.” “I beg you to keep him---(the old man) in your mind awhile. He afterward complained of my ingratitude.” “The ground of which complaint, I know to be this. My partner, the letter writer, furnished me with a civil introduction to this old gentleman, in which, adroitly enough, he alluded to something in his early history, which tickled him. I presented the letter; and was asked---I believe---but I am not sure---how the writer was. That was the extent of his civility. Not another word passed, having any relation to him, or to me; and I went away, with a feeling of strong and heated indignation against myself, for having born the letter; and against the writer, for having subjected me to such a mortification; and against old Mr. Galligan, for his ill manners; nor did I ever go to see him again. But one day, some months afterward, somebody, whom I took to be a mendicant; or, at least, some small dealer; for I had forgotten his face, came into my store; and, after sitting there awhile, urged me to come up, and see him. It was Mr. Galligan himself. I smiled at his civility; for my store was then loaded with goods; and I was full of business. Ought I not to be grateful, very grateful, to one that was willing to sell me a bale or two of coarse woollens, under such circumstances? Ought I not, when, at twenty-four hours notice, I could have purchased five times the amount of his whole stock, in the publick market---gratitude!— Yes! I am full of gratitude!---and here is a proof of it.” “Yet, of this, he complained afterward---when we had paid, or secured our borrowed money, and endorsements, as an ill requited act of friendship—Alas!--- the impudence of some men!” “Well-- as our difficulties thickened upon us, we began to follow his advice; and pay off, such of our creditors---as were foolish enough to take them, in goods; but, unfortunately---they would not hold out. And we were obliged then, to propose an accommodation. We corresponded with our creditors. All had the “highest, best opinion in the world, of our honesty and excellence,” and all that---were “excessively sorry,” but, “really, times were so hard,” that they---“could not afford---to say---yes or no,” to any of our propositions. At last, however, they promised to accede, one by one, to an assignment of our property; and discharge us.” “It was drawn up. Months were consumed in the negotiation; and, when nearly all had signed, the remainder held out, the scoundrels! in the hope of obtaining better terms for themselves.” “There was now, no other way open to us, but to petition, for a discharge under the insolvent law. This we had been most reluctant to do---, but, at last, did it; and then came the rub. In a short time, we were so utterly reduced; beggared, that, from having had the command of almost unlimited sums---we were scarcely able, at times, except by borrowing, to take a letter out of the post office. My elder partner, the married one, fell sick;---and I stood by him, and saw friend after friend pass away from him---the whole world go by him---for he had fallen among thieves; and none stopped, to pour tears, or wine, or oil into his wounds---Yea!---I saw his family go from him, one by one; his children; his wife; and himself, left alone, utterly alone, in the maturity of his years; like a shipwrecked man---famished and bruised, clinging to his only rock---a compassionate God; while an ocean of darkness roared under his feet; and the tide was rising. Yet, how did he bear it. As one that knoweth the Scripture; and believeth, that “whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth.” Yet, there were doubt and harrowing; and who would not have had them, situated as he was---his towering faculties darkened; his wife and children passing, like pale apparitions, before him; the noblest sympathies of nature blasted, all at once; outraged in their luxuriance, as by the ashes and lava of some inward eruption of the heart! By him, have I set, when the last spoon of his wife had just been sold, to pay the rent of his room; and he seemed deserted of all but God;—when his dark, luminous eyes; and heavy, black brows were like statuary; motionless and marble like. And there were times too, in the deep solitude of midnight, when his Bible lay open before him; and he, it might be, was the only mortal awake, in a populous city, except the prowling murderer; the roused watchman; or the dying; or the broken hearted,---when, had he not been a good, as well as a great man, he would have lain down upon his bed, and never risen again, but to face his creditors before the bar of the Everlasting God---red with his own blood.” “But enough. I cannot talk of this---it is too serious for me. It shakes me too like the passion of a wild beast. But the trial had its issue; and the sun broke out upon him; and from the east, there came out a great multitude to meet him. He is now happy--- God be thanked!---happy, as a mere mortal may be, among them that love him, and reverence him; and them, that he has wedded himself, and his immortality to.” “But, during the time of our trouble---a time that I now regard as the happiest, and most truly productive of our lives,---it was my misfortune to be employed in some negotiations, that grew out of them. Yet my temper was not of the right sort. It would not brook a great deal of kicking and cuffing, even by implication, without kicking and cuffing in turn.” “Among others that I saw, not to wheedle; not to intimidate; and, still less to be intimidated by, was a Mr. Termor. Somehow or other, he had become our creditor; by endorsement, I believe. I waited upon him, with the smooth tongued financier, my partner, bearing the assignment in my hand. Our interview was short: and much in the following fashion. But you should first understand, that he is an uneducated, strong minded vulgar, honest man, of ungovernable temper, and handsome property. Yet, I dare say, with a likely heart, as you say in New England.” “Pardon me, said I, we never apply the word in that way; we say, a likely man.” “That paper, said I, (Hammond is speaking,) handing him the assignment, and laying my hat upon the desk---contains a relinquishment of all our property, for the benefit of our creditors. Those who sign will get their share; those who do not, must take their chance, and—” “Why, how now?---What the devil's this? hey?---” said he. I repeated the thing, in a very respectful manner---- “Don't understand it---don't understand it—must (spit) sign it---must I? d---d if I do---. By God, sir—(spit.) This was courtly, to be sure; but I was never much accustomed to tolerate such a carriage, even in the rich and ignorant. So I told him very plainly, that, if he expected to get a farthing, he must sign it.” “Come here,” said he, “d'm it---(spit) come here; (spit)” “By---G-d---; come here, and buy my goods--- here---! hey!---must sign, must sign, hey--damn'd if I do!—” The blood was starting through the man's face, as he said this; and I, utterly weary of such vulgarity and arrogance, looked him, I am afraid, in the eyes, in a way that did'nt much please him;---replaced my hat, with a flourish, upon my head, as I did so; and halted, leisurely, out of his counting room.” “You can have no idea of his tremendous passion--- after I had gone; and long, and long afterward, it was near to the bursting of a blood vessel, for him to meet vol. ii. I me, particularly, as he swore that I rode the handsomest horse in the city, on which I, the “hump-backed rascal,” as he called me, had well nigh ridden over him.” “Nay---he never will forget my parting look, I am sure; for thrice since, when he had forgotten me, the resurrection of that, hath shaken him like a battering engine. Once, I was in the theatre, talking busily, to some ladies, in a box, next to some other ladies, of the patrician order, upon whom it was not lawful for me to set my eyes, except at second hand. Mr. T. was talking with them. I saw that he was struck with my countenance (he did not see my person; for I stood in a shadow, and wore a large blue watch cloak.) He listened to me, also, with evident pleasure, though with some perturbation—; and I, like an experienced coquette, played off my very best conversation, in such a way, that—why should I deny it—he appeared astonished, delighted, and willing to talk at me, as piqued lovers sometimes do, you know, through a third person—at each other.” “At last, I saw him lean forward to one of the ladies; and heard him ask my name.” “I turned immediately, and lowered my forehead, so that he could see nothing but the twinkle of my eyes, with the intention of seeing how he looked, when he heard her answer.” “My name was pronounced; and the man absolutely turned pale, and shook with passion—and shame, I am sure.” “And, at another time, when he had forgotten me again, he saw me enter a court room, where several persons who, one year before, could not have been made to know me, were especially polite to me. He remembered my countenance, but not me; and made me, before he recollected himself, a most gracious bow. I knew the man—and, as I returned it, I elevated my eyes slowly to his, with the very same devil in them, I am sure, that he had seen, years before, in his counting room. The blood rushed over his whole face; and his hands shook upon the table.” “We have never met since, and, probably, never shall meet; but, at this very hour, if I wanted a favour, that I would not ask of any other man, I would go to him—pretty sure, for he is generous and manly, that I should not be disappointed.” “That would depend,” said I, “much upon the nature of the favour---if you wanted your throat cut now, or---a halter.” “O, no, “he replied, smiling; I am very serious.” En.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. Hammond continues his narrative...Insolvency...Mr. Galligan... A noble heart...Another...Another!...Turns author...Studies the law...Poetry...Preface!...Effect of telling your own story, in your own way, first. It was after midnight, when Hammond concluded the conversation, related in the last chapter; but the following night, he renewed the subject. “I have already told you, something of a man, named Galligan.—Do not forget, that he was no friend of mine, in any shape; he showed me no favour; and at the time of our failure, was the first to secure himself, with notes and paper, in preference to goods: Yet, he became the most malignant, wicked, and unsparing, of all our persecutors, for having followed his advice. I do not mention his real name, because he is old and wretched, now; and has a fine family.” “We have, as I suppose you know, an insolvent law, in our state. Of this, I finally availed myself, in a feeling of desperation; indignant at the baseness, and shuffling of the men about me. A creditor, under this law, has, until two years after a discharge granted, to file, what are called, “allegations,” against the debtor; and these allegations are usually of fraud, or embezzlement, which, if substantiated, leave the debtor subject to perpetual imprisonment.” “The first thing that irritated old Mr. Galligan, was the letter, of which I spoke; he always felt, when it was mentioned, as if that had wheedled him out of all his money; yet, in truth, he had little to complain of; for I do believe, that, including all our purchases, and payments, he could not have lost by us, though he had given up the balance of his claim; the next thing, was the utter ruin of several new houses, whose paper, he had selected, with a sagacity, peculiar to an experienced trader; for he knows that,though a man be a scoundrel, he will generally pay his first note.—In securing himself, Mr. Galligan had selected the first notes, of several new houses; all of which, we afterward discovered, were linked together; and all went by the board, at once! This fretted him to madness. But there was another event to increase the exasperation. In the multitude of our concerns, there was a valuable estate, in New England, upon which some thousands had been expended, first and last,out of the joint fund. Both of my partners were interested in it; one, of his own right; and the other, in right of his wife. But, in our season of difficulty, we had tried every possible means, to raise money upon it; and always in vain; for it was encumbered by an able conveyancer, with a widow's dower, and the maintenance of a large family. In plain truth, as we had been unable to raise a dollar upon it, we did not consider it worth a dollar; and, when we proposed the assignment, for the benefit of our creditors, we omitted that estate. Yet, soon after, when it was necessary to give in our schedule, upon oath, we were more particular; and, although we did not believe the estate worth registering, still it was a claim, or right, and we, therefore, gave it in.” “But, the indefatigable Mr. Galligan was not to be appeased in so simple a way. He, therefore, inclosed an one hundred dollar note, to a lawyer, in the neighbourhood, and ordered an attachment, or execution,against our interest in the estate; or so much of it, as our concern were entitled to. It was sold; and the nett proceeds, at public auction, were somewhere about twenty dollars! We laughed heartily; and who could blame us, when we heard of the matter.” “But the old man's wrath still burnt on, night and day; and, as if it were not enough to drive three men, to beggary and starvation—two of them, out of their only means of livelihood, he set calmly about driving the whole to suicide—by blasting their characters. His first step was to file allegations against me; of what!” I was startled at the convulsive, agitated, deep tone of Hammond, as he concluded these words; and looked him up on the face. Never shall I forget his expression— never! It was just as if his great heart were vol. ii. I2 half crushed, all at once, under the thought; as if it were worse than death, to have been suspected of any thing wrong, mercenary, or dishonourable. “What did he allege against you? fraud!” said I. “Fraud!—fraud!” echoed Hammond, grinding his teeth, while the sweat stood upon his lips; and his eyes grew blood-shot, like those of a chafed catamount— and a bitter smile went over them. “No—he dared not. No!—I never knew what they contained. Never!—they were got up in secrecy; and, with the management of one that dared not—aye, that dared not confront an honest man;—they stood against me, for nearly two years, without my knowledge. Time and again, had I heard the rumour, that allegations were filed against me;—again and again, had I gone to meet them, but no, they were not to be found. At last, God give me patience!—I discovered the trick. It was done to blast me;dishonour me, secretly, without giving me an opportunity for defence. Who would care to know, whether they were ever answered, or the hand accursed, and withered, that had written them? Who would ever have known it? Nobody. Yet, all the world could easily learn, that allegations had been filed—and, though they never came to trial, that were enough. To have been arraigned, though never tried;---or, if tried, acquitted, were enough to kill a proud heart. Yet, I have a proud heart, and it did not kill me! I compelled the counsel of the oppressor to do battle, over and over again, until there was no ground left, for him to stand upon. Thus ended Mr. Gallagan's last hateful attempt at vengeance. And what was the effect? To drive me away, all my life, from among merchants; to teach me a reliance upon myself alone. I could tell you more of these things—many more particularly of a scoundrel in New York, who has twice arrested one of us; and taken from him his very travelling trunk. O!—is it not shameful? Had we been dishonest, we could have kept back a hundred thousand dollars, from the wreck of our affairs; but no; we turned ourselves out into the world naked, pennyless, literally pennyless!” “But, (his voice faltered a little, and there was less sternness in it, than before.) “They were not inaccessible to misfortune. He was not. I told him so. I went to him, once!--By heaven, the spirit of prophecy was upon me! I went to him, with my proud heart swelling, to pray that he would not imprison my elder partner, who was in such a perilous situation, that it would be death to him. Yes! I prayed to him; but he was obdurate.” “It will be but for a little time, sir,” said I, “in a few weeks, he will be discharged. It will be death to him, and all his prospects, if you send him to jail. He will not give bail---he cannot.” “Then let him go to jail,” was the reply. “I felt for a moment, as if I were choking; but I remembered that I was a petitioner; not for myself; and I proceeded, so mildly, that he turned upon me, as if doubting his own ears. “He will die there,” said I. “Let him die---then!” was the answer. “Old man!” said I, unable to keep down my wrath ---he trembled---“Old man!” I locked my hands, I remember; and I spoke with all my heart and soul. “There is none of us inaccessible to misfortune! Even you---you, may be visited next;---and, when you are a suppliant---nay, I feel it here—I feel it!—I shall live to see you—and O, how devoutly do I pray it!—shaking with the same terrour; humbled in the same supplication.” “To jail with him—to jail, he shall go,” cried he, inarticulate with passion. “By God!” said I, “he shall not go to jail!” “Nor should he, though I had gone out upon the high way, with a pistol, to redeem him.” “William Adams, look at me; put your hand upon my forehead; what feel you there?” “A hot fire.” “No beating—no rushing?” “Aye, it beats mightily; and the rush is that of a sluice, newly opened.” “With what feeling, think you?” “Wrath and hatred.” “You are mistaken. It is compassion. My wrath is gone by; my hatred is extinct. That old man has been visited since—has been wrecked, even in reputation; [7] [7] Commercial reputation is meant:—The honesty of the man is not questioned.—Ed. and, if living at this moment, is delirious. Who would not pity him? I must; for I feel as if my own prayer may have brought down a portion of this great sorrow and humiliation upon him, and his family. Then why do I mention it? That you may know me, truly, and as I am; one that has been goaded onward by ambition, with poisoned arrows—one, who, if he paused, had died, of a broken heart; and one— thanks be to Him,that hath upheld me; who hath outlived his persecutors, as he told them, that he would; and already stands, where they would never have believed that he could stand.” “But did you not foresee this, certainly, before?” said I. “What! our failure? No, and so little did I suspect the ultimate insolvency of the concern, that, while I was paying off all the world in goods, I forebore to pay my own mother; a poor widow woman, a few hundred dollars, that I had collected for her—thinking it safer for her to wait the issue, than to take goods. The obligation was sacred—the money was not mine— it was her all. A poor widow woman---my own mother! Do you think that I would not have paid her, if I had suspected any danger? By heaven, I would, if it had cost me the sacrifice of fifty thousand dollars! Aye, and my heart's blood into the bargain.” “But, you would know, it may be, if there have been no noble hearts in my journeying, to beat loudly with encouragement to mine. There were. Let me do them justice. Some have been my friends, through thick and thin; through cloud and shine. Them shall I never forget. Some have come out boldly, and spoken in my praise, while I was unknown to them. They shall never be forgotten. Some few have lent me books, and treated me like a man: and two or three have been to me like brothers. But, chief among them, was one who, stout hearted, like yourself, William, had a hundred times your wisdom; and while he rebuked me—made me better, even while he rebuked me. He has been my friend through all vicissitude---yea, even where I have deserved to lose him.” “And is yet?” said I, doubtfully. “Yes.” “Then why seek another?” “Because he is older, better than I---married---and, having duties to fulfil, that are incompatible with such friendship as I require, at this time.” “But let me tell you what he is. He has been my adviser, counseller, and true friend, for years; daring to tell me of my faults; shrinking not from authority or peril, when my rebellious nature awoke too stormily before him---setting his foot upon my vanity; and deriding my vain glory. And when—pardon my incoherency---when this man, after a change in his favour, had barely enough for the subsistance of his wife and babes—still anxious that I should be, what he always foretold that I should be, if I toiled patiently, for it—he would have pressed upon me a portion of that little, till I was enabled to enter my profession. O, my friend—it is bitter—very bitter, to be pennyless, at my age, after having been really independent!—to begin the business of life anew—at the very alphabet—and threshold; to throw by a trade, that has employed all the best years of your being, and begin another, unfriended and alone! Yet, I dared to attempt this. I began to study the law. Few people could believe that I was serious: and fever still, that I would persist in it. All admitted that I had genius—but none, that it would ever be productive. What a pity! they would say, that he cannot work—that these geniuses never will work. William Adams!—I sat down to my table; ---and for, five years, did I toil, literally, night and day. I was a poet. And men said that I should live and die a poet. That was enough for me. I abandoned poetry for ever. I wanted patience, they said. I sat down to my profession; and went through a course of legal study, that was calculated by an eminent and industrious lawyer, for ten years. Particular parts of the law, I was told, I should be unable to master. I never rested, till they were as familiar to me, as my own name. Languages were difficult. I was told that I could never learn one, at my age. I learnt six, without stopping. It was difficult to write well—it required patience---talent. I wrote books, therefore, of one kind and another; and supported myself, even in America, wholly by my pen, for nearly four years of uninterrupted toil and study---having written and published, within that time, beside all my other studies, what would make, at least, twenty-five duodecimo volumes.” “Was not this enough? No---come to my study, and I will show you manuscript; evidence, in black and white, that, had I done nothing else, for the last five years, would earn for me, the name of an industrious, if not that of an unexampled student.” “But—had I no friends?—none. Let me tell you. First, I was haughty; I could not brook an obligation The time would come, I thought, when it might pain me, to hear any man say--“But for me, he would never have been what he is. It was I that lifted him.” “Was that right, Hammond?”—said I. “Yes---I feel that it was right; but, let me proceed. I have been put under some obligation, and I cannot breathe freely, till I have told it. In the first place, there was a man, who, when I was very forbidding, cold, and haughty, had the wisdom to look into my heart, and to see—the truth;—that I was proud, because I was poor; and would not be mistaken, by any possibility, for one that sneaks and bows to better or more powerful men. He was a lawyer; and he treated me like a man. To most of his profession; to all indeed, but one other, I was an intruder. And the merchants regarded me, as one that had got above his business---the lawyers, as one that could never rise to their's---heaven help them!---but was doomed to perish, between hawk and buzzard! But this man had the courage to throw open a magnificent library to me. To him, am I chiefly indebted; for he, it was, that dared to do this, first. And, next to him,--my friend!—my heart leaps in my bosom, at the recollection of another! ---was a gentleman;---one of the best Advocates of the United States; a fiery, impetuous, headlong fellow--- with a mind singularly active, brilliant, and keen sighted---truly eloquent, but exceeding passionate and electrick. He took me directly into his office; treated me like a friend; a companion; imposed no drudgery upon me; left me to make use of his name, in any way that could be serviceable to me;---and, in short, suffered me to go abroad, with the reputation of having studied with him;---and all this, without any reward, bribe, or compensation. Shall I ever forget him!—no. And the time will come---yea, it shall come, if God spare my life, when I will prove my gratitude to him, by better proof than words; and when he shall rejoice that he did this. I--it shall be his pride.” “But---did you receive no pecuniary assistance— none at all? You had a rich uncle.” “He offered, repeatedly, to assist me---but his offer was as constantly rejected; until I was, at last, on the point of translating a French law work of two volumes, octavo; which I had offered to do, in sixty days; and add my own notes, of from fifty, to one hundred pages, that should be submitted to any lawyer of the county ---for two hundred dollars. He interfered; and prevented me from wasting any more time in literature, by lending me, in one way and another, somewhere about the same sum. More, I might have had---for his heart was full, when we parted---his generous countenance flushed with feeling---and his hand trembled. “Draw on me, William,” said he---“draw on me!” and looked, as if I might have drawn on him, for his heart's blood.” “And was this all!—How did you support yourself?---how could you---so long?” “Yes---it was all”---as I have told you, by making books.” “But how could you make books, and pursue your study of law, languages and miscellany?” “O, there was no difficulty in it. It did not average an hour a day, the labour that I gave to book-making.” “What!---in America,---support yourself with working one hour a day, for the publick!” “Yes; and at this time, I feel assured that I could support my self and a family, like a gentleman, by the same business.” “What! by authorship, where we are proverbially penurious, in our reward of native talent; slavish in our prejudices; and at liberty, to publish the best of foreign productions, after their reputation is established, without any expense for the copy right. How is it possible, for an author here, to enter into competition with all the authors of Europe?” “I cannot stop now, to explain the reasons in detail; the chief one is sufficient. We are beginning to have respect for ourselves; and to be, for that reason, respected abroad; and, it is my firm belief, that the time is fast coming, when it will be a better name for a literary work, to call it American, than English, or Scotch. The fashion of reading what our country men write, is gaining ground, every day. What was Scotch literature, twenty-five years ago?—the derision of the English. What is it now? Their terrour and delight.” “But what put it into your head, to commence authorship?---you had no education.” “Patience, for a moment; and I will tell you. Allow me first to say, in justice to mankind, that there are better and brighter; aye, and warmer hearts, among them, than we are sometimes ready to believe, when darkened by calumny, or roused by disappointment.” “Three or four, have I already mentioned; but, there are a few others. One, a poor man, whom I had occasionally seen; a sick man too, who had gone to an exteme southern climate, for his health; and wanted, as you may suppose, every dollar that he could muster, for himself. He had the generosity to offer me a sum; not very considerable, to be sure, but much more than he could well spare, to be repaid, when I pleased. Another, an iron-hearted man, and a little mercenary, I had thought, before, came to my office; and looking me awhile, in the face, sat down, in considerable perturbation.” “Pray, what is the matter?” said I; “you look troubled.” He hemmed and hawed; and adjusted, and re-adjusted his legs; without speaking.” “You have head something unpleasant, that concerns me, I said. Speak out; whatever it be, I can bear it. Do not distress yourself about it. Out with it.” “Want any money?” said he. “Money!” I cried; startled at his abruptness;---“money! What do you mean?” “Do you want any money?---that's all---do you want any money? If you do, say so;” he repeated. “What could I say? The tears came into my eyes. “No;” said I; “no; but I thank you. I thank you, from the bottom of my heart. It has given me a better opinion of human nature. I do not want money. I have undertaken a profession, in the face and eyes of all discouragement; and I will make that support me—or starve.” Here Hammond paused for a while; and I took up the conversation, and questioned him. “What!” said I, “did you abandon writing?” “Yes---altogether, in the way of a support. I scribbled, occasionally, for a journal, or a newspaper; but, without fee or reward.” “Was it prudent? Your profession was precarious. Your laws are dilatory. Two or three years, I am told, often pass, before a verdict is had; and, sometimes, five or six. Clients seldom pay in advance; and rarely, I suppose, to young practitioners. How were you to live?” “I hardly knew; I confess. I thought of all that; but I knew, that, to be great in anything, one must confine himself to it. I was willing to be a lawyer; a great one---and I knew, that I could not be that, and an author too.” “But did you love the law?” “Love it!---yea....more truly, than Cæsar ever loved war. It was a passion with me: is yet: and will be. I love it, as the school of eloquence, power, dominion, —the fountain of legislation, politicks—the trial place, for senators and statesmen. Love it! Aye, next to vol. ii. K my God—as the only thing capable of purifying, and exalting my nature—giving scope and elevation to my faculties. Love it! What! Could I have sacrificed every other passion, every other pursuit, every other desire of excellence to it; and that too, with the chance of starvation, at the threshold, had I not loved it!---worshipped it.” “But you continued to write.” “I did not. I abandoned writing. And, when I returned to it, it was when other men were revelling--- when all the world were asleep;--and then, not as to a labour, or a study; but as to a relaxation. It was excitement and intoxication to me---with the eye of God, only, waking above me. I felt, under the blue midnight, more of that heated and beautiful, passionate, sweet thrilling, all through me, with my own pen in my hand, and my paper before me, than other men, in the banqueting hall; at the gambling table—the place of dancing, dissipation, or festivity—yea, more than them, that slept quietly, in the arms of beauty!” “How could this be?” “I'll tell you. Have you ever been sick—or imprisoned?” “Aye; both.” “Well....do you remember the tumult in your blood, when you first came out upon the hills, and saw every thing in motion about you....the tree tops....the grass ....the great waters....the birds....and the countenances of men. Did you not see a thousand beauties, that you never would have seen, had you not been sick and in prison.” “Undoubtedly....I felt like a disenthralled spirit —I—.” “Sir—William Adams. The man that goes out, with a right nature, to worship his Maker, after he has done all the duties of the day, to his fellow man— meets with wonders and miracles, at every step. At the beginning of the day, he hears armies in motion— the four corners of heaven striking their tents. At noon, he sees a world encompassed, by embracing cherubim, whose plumage is what men call sunshine, rolling over the unfathomable depth of heaven. At sun-set, he sees the whole ocean, of a wine colour— and more transparent, than any wine; and looking down into it, with a miraculous organ—down, to the very bottom—he sees the golden Serpent, and the green Water-Dragon, evolving there, continually, among the scarlet coral, and great rocks of carbuncles.—And at night—O, God! what does he not see, when all the stars of Jehovah are abroad, upon their mission! How could this be? Because I husbanded my enjoyment. It could well be—for I made these hours dear to me, by variety. I bought them with pain, and toil, and travail—the agony and throes of my intellect— and I husbanded them, like an experienced voluptuary.” “Did you visit?” “No.” “Frolick, in any way?” “No—except on paper, and alone.” “Had you no friends to visit you?” “No—I would not permit it. My time was too precious. I took a room, in the very outskirts of the town, where most that knew me, were ashamed to come; and as for other men, it was too far; and by too bad a road. There, I lived, alone; walking into town, often, twice or three times a day, loaded with books, like a pack horse.” “But—before I forget it—there were other men, like these—and one, in particular, who knew me not; but prompted by his own noble heart, knowing no evil of me, but by report; and some good, of his own knowledge, he had the manhood to come out, once, and throw down his gauntlet, in an assembly of men, who were bitterly prejudiced against me. I knew it not, till afterward; but—I have not forgotten it—whatever he may think.” “But you spoke of your poetry—I have been reading some of it since our last conversation,” said I. “You have! and what do you think of it?” “Not much. Don't be offended with me---but—” “Offended with you! no, indeed; every man has a right to his own opinion: and surely, you, who have written poetry, have, at least, as good a right as another, to express it, with freedom. Beside all that, you are my friend; and, I might suspect your sincerity, or partiality, or judgment, if you praised it.” “You look a little angry, nevertheless—” “Indeed, I hope not. I do not feel angry. I am only very much in earnest. But you are not the first, who have mistaken my exceeding earnestness, for want of temper. However, now, that we are upon it; allow me to tell you something, that may be of use to you. You have not a pure taste in poetry; and you want independence.” “Oh!—just what I might have expected! That judgment of me, is in retaliation. You say that I want independence and taste, because I do not praise your poetry!” “Yes—precisely. I do not skulk at all from the inference. I say, at once, that any man who can read my poetry, without being carried away by it, now and then, is neither a poet himself, nor a judge of poetry. Don't look at me so. I am profoundly in earnest;--- the more so, I dare say, because, at this moment, I do not care one fig about my reputation as a poet. I forget myself, entirely.---I am talking of myself, precisely, as I would, of another; as if I were an abstract idea; and my poetry a mere supposition. Again, I say, that if you do not tremble, and gasp, over some passages in my poetry, that you are wholly destitute of the poetical taste---or miserably deficient in courage, (why do you start?) moral courage, I mean; and independence. Nay---let me tell the plain truth. You would think far more highly of what I have written, if you did not know me, at all; or, only by sight. And why? Because you wish to avoid the foolish partiality of friendship; because you have seen the senses of other men so blinded and perverted, by their partiality, for one, whom they knew and loved, that they could see no fault at all, in any thing that he did. You, in avoiding that folly, have run into a far more mischievous one. A truly independent nature would be honest, bold, and discriminating; it would discover faults and excellencies, alike, in every page, on account of its own friendly anxiety and love, which would never be discovered by the common reader. I grant that fools praise indiscriminately. But wise men never censure indiscriminately. It is always a very easy thing to say, that such a work is wonderful, or such a man great; but the difficulty is to point to the very place—to put your finger upon it; where the one is great, or the other wonderful. It were easy to say, that a thing is marvellous; but the difficulty lies in proving it---in giving a reason for it. You are too indolent for either. Did you not know me; and, were any thing that I have written, to fall in your way, by accident---or, as coming from abroad, you would entertain, altogether, a different opinion of it.” “You are mistaken, Hammond.” “I am not mistaken. My friends have never been able to endure any thing that I have ever written--- after they once knew that I had written it. My dearest friends have thrown by, volume after volume, of my prose and poetry; when they knew it to be mine; with an alacrity exactly in proportion to their certainty of its being mine. It is really true. When I have been praised, in every case, it has been by people, altogether unknown to me; whose faces I had never seen; whose names I had never heard. But I have been most cruelly abused, and admonished--- privately, and publickly, by my avowed friends---most of whom had the impudence, to declare, at the same time---as if to give their criticism, all the weight that they could; that they loved and admired, and respected me!---while they damned my writing. Only once or twice, have I been spoken highly of, by any personal acquaintance; or any critick, after he came to know any thing of me, apart from my works. In general, I have never permitted them---and, in no case, have I ever requested them, or anybody, to praise me, or ever speak of me. No—I am wrong, I have twice requested people to show me no mercy.” “I could tell you some pleasant things of this kind. Perhaps they are afraid of spoiling me— VOL. II. K 2 of turning my head, by praise. Ah, they little know, me, if they think that any body could raise me in my own opinion, in any way. I wrote a poem once. A perfect stranger, a man of great talent, but no judge of poetry, spoke in the highest terms of it—and, particularly, of the preface—while another, at the same moment, who happened to know me, denounced the preface as the very devil, for wretched writing—and the poetry, as not much better. With the former, I afterwards became somewhat acquainted; and lost his good opinion by it,—while the first, who did'nt happen to see me, for a long time, came to have the highest regard for me! I then wrote a tragedy. The former looked at it—his heart failed him—he praised it—but, much as if it went against his conscience. I wrote several other matters, most of which he took no notice at all of, and the rest, he stigmatised, as the most wretched abortions. Why?—because he was my friend!—because he had'nt the courage to see merit and power in a friend; because he could'nt believe in the greatness of a companion; and, because he was afraid to encounter the ridicule of the world, for supposed partiality. So, with twenty other works. My own personal friends—the best of them—would never read them—because they know me, and love me, and respect me! My only sister has done little else, than weep and blush, for me, ever since I began to write; and my own mother could never get through a short poem of mine, written chiefly to please her—because, she was afraid of her own judgment—and dared not believe the thrilling, that she felt in her blood, to be any thing but a maternal solicitude and partiality—the yearning of natural weakness, for the offspring of her own child; while other people, strangers to me, and to her—read it with rapture and amazement. So, with a multitude of things. I have been most extravagantly praised by the first men of the age—perfect strangers to me, in every case—some of whom, I have, afterward, come to know—and, in every instance—as they have learned to love and respect me—they have thought proper to love and respect my writing less and less!—by way of proving their own exceeding impartiality, and independence.” “You have written a good deal?” “Yes—for a man of my age—for I was old, when I began to write.” “Let me know something about this. You have done with poetry, you say—what do you mean?” “That I have abandoned it.” “Why?” “Because one cannot be both a poet, and a lawyer; and—and the fame of the lawyer, is a nobler object for ambition, than—” “Than that of the poet! Gracious heaven!—a lawyer! greater than a poet!” “Aye, than any poet that ever lived. I would rather deserve the reputation of a great lawyer, than to unite, in my own proper person, all the fame, of all the greatest poets, that have ever lived!” “You are mad, Hammond. The greatest lawyer is soon forgotten; the great poet, never.” “Poh!—nonsense. That is the common slang of the day. Great lawyers are never forgotten—or Lawyers, I might say; for no man can be a lawyer, without being great—Attorneys, Conveyancers are forgotten: Lawyers are not....Counsellers....Advocates are not.” “You have abandoned poetry, then?” “Yes—” “But, how do you mean. Have you abandoned writing it?” “Yes—” “It is a shame.” “No—it is not. It is right.” “It was a passion with you—was it not?” “True—but a subordinate passion; one, that I immolated to a nobler one.” “Why?—” “Because, people said that I could not.” “The spirit of contradiction, then.” “Humph—” “Had it much influence with you?” “Omnipotent. It has made me what I am—and will make me, all that I shall ever be. They said, that I could not sit still. I sat, till I almost grew to my seat. They said that I could not study. I studied, till I was almost blind. They said, that I was shamefully deficient in patience. I made an index to a work of twelve octavo volumes of—of—heaven knows what. I only know, that they contain the substance of every thing, that had transpired in heaven and earth, for some years; and would have made about twenty or thirty common volumes of history; and had actually worn out the patience of three predecessors—and driven the most patient man of the age to despair—the most laborious work of the kind, I do believe, that was ever done by man. They thought me presumptuous, because I dared to give an opinion, of poetry and painters. I entered the lists—wrote criticism—poetry, novels, plays, sermons, law, physick, and divinity.” “But you will write more poetry?” “And publish it?—” “Yes.” “Never. I may write, one day or other, when, the moon changes, as other men get drunk, for exhilaration; but never seriously; and I shan't publish. That I shall leave to the consciences of my administrators—or to their courage, I might say.” “I do not believe you. You cannot leave it off.” “Others have told me the same thing. But I have done with it—: cannot—pshaw!” “You, done with it! when your very language is full of it—full, even in conversation.” “Is it!---I am sorry for it. You pay me no compliment. It is childish. No---you are mistaken. You never heard it, in argument, from me---never.” I saw that he was perfectly sincere; and yet, it seemed to me, hardly possible, that one could disdain a gift like that—and I said so. “A gift! nonsense. Poetry is no gift. It is only a little quicker sensibility than common;—more irritability of nerve—a more inflammatory system.” “But the rapidity and beauty of combination, the—” “O, don't bother yourself about poetry, William. You know little or nothing about it. It is a disease. Some minds, there are, into which, when a thought enters, it is always, with a battalion of associations.—All their peculiarities can be accounted for, by a little more physical sensibility than common.' “What!—Are all men poets, who have this kind of sensibility?” “No, not at all poets—but poets, painters, musicians, orators—or of some other profession, where judgment, patience, wisdom, and perseverance, are not most wanted;—not mathematicians, theologians logicians, nor mechanicks.” “I have read your preface—what a rigmarole it is!” He laughed heartily. “You are right—entirely right. Yet it is a pretty fair transcript of my usual conversation:—nay, perhaps, of my character, at that time. One that knew me well—and blushed and wept, in reading it, said so.” “You appeared to talk from your heart; but such vanity—such presumption!” “True—I was vain, then; and am not much humbler, now. But, I havemore cunning; and perhaps, more wisdom, now. One thing, however, I must tell you. When I wrote that preface, originally, it contained only twelve or fifteen pages: but it lay on my table, for some weeks, waiting for the press. In the mean time, my eye would glance over it, now and then, when I was worn out with study—and sat lolling at the wall—and I would add an occasional note, on the blank side; for, in writing for the press, I write only on one side of the paper.” “These notes gradually accumulated to the size of their present shape; but, unluckily, my references were omitted, as the printer was—like other printers, none of the wisest—and printed text and context, margin and commentary, pell mell, altogether, page after page. I am, naturally, the most patient of men; and very amiable—very—and full of expedients. So, I went to work; and, by splicing in a sentence, here; dove-tailing a phrase there; and lopping off another here, I succeeded in reducing the fracture, or dislocation, to its present shape.” “But what, in the name of heaven, could induce you to tell the story of your disgrace in Philadelphia?” “Hark'ee Adams. It has always been a maxim with me, if I run my head against a post, to be the first to laugh. If I had not told the story, some body else would, and it would have stuck to me, like a mortal discomfiture, to my dying day:—whereas, now, it is altogether the reverse. It is now a thousand times more disgraceful, to the Athenians, than to me. Yet, I cannot deny the justice of your censure. Several of my best friends were unable to read the preface through; and my own mother locked up the whole book, with tears in her eyes, when she received it, and would not let it go abroad, till she had received good evidence from me, that the confession was my own; and that it was no counterfeit or forgery; and had not been racked out of me by terrour or madness.” “But how beneath your dignity!” “Dignity! Talk to me of dignity---why! if the Philadelphians had been left to tell the story, in their own way, I should never have stood upright---you smile---I do not mean in body, William Adams, but in soul—again, while I had life in me:---and so too, if I had told it with diguity.” “But what good effect had it?” “What good effect! I`ll tell you. It made some of them ashamed of themselves, and of the city---and some laugh heartily at themselves, and at the book; but nobody, at me. That was all that I wanted.” “Nay, it did more. It made me some warm friends there; set them to thinking upon their arrogance and pretension---and, best of all, drove one of their reviewers, to a course, that I had been three years battling with them about---a recantation of a vile and malignant attack upon the poetry of a friend: (it was handsomely made;) and a slight, very slight, timid, but respectful notice of my poem, at the tail end of some other. I smiled---for I saw what it was meant for--- a playing off---a sort of a dash and somerset to begin with;—something in the way of magnanimity, to set off a new journal with. Nay---that was not all; for a man who wrote a satire in Athens upon the American Bards, was simple enough to pay me a compliment or two, partly in prose, and partly in poetry, Philadelphian as he was---for which I thank him;---though I do assure you that his praise was far less than enough, to counterbalance the censure of a scape-gallows poet, of the west, whose book I have never yet seen; though I have striven mightily; and am told that he has cut me up root and branch---and that Mr. Southwick, of the Plow-Boy, had entered the lists, on my behalf. But I have met with an extract from it; and, really, painful as it is I am obliged to confess, that---that he seems a devilish off hand sort of a fellow, though my friends wont think of such a thing.” He stopped, and looked at his watch—“Take a bed in the next room, William, will you? and, to-morrow, I will finish,” said he. “You don't know what to make of me, yet. I do not wonder. I am so exceedingly like yourself---contradictory---incomprehensible.”</field>

Letter from W—...Remarks of Hammond...Natural writing ...Vanities...Doctrine.....Illustration...Poetry.....System of study...Law...Languages...Mode of teaching them, reprobated ...Vanity...Matters and things in general...Ballast. We were scarcely seated, the next morning, at the table, when the post man brought a handful of letters, and laid them before Hammond. “You seem to have a large correspondence?” “Yes”—said he; “and one of the least profitable, in the world; but I shall be done with it. I cannot afford such pleasure. With the exception of two or three persons, my correspondents are altogether young men, whom, at different times, I have encountered, in a state of torpidity; electrified, almost to combustion, by the contact—and put, bare footed, upon the fiery track of Ambition; of the whole—ah—what have we here— Wallace—by heaven! Well,—let me see what he says.” He opened it; and, as he read, I saw his countenance change—like the tablet of a camera obscura:— every passion—every feeling, every emotion of his heart, perhaps of the human heart, went over his broad forehead, and beautiful mouth, till he threw down the letter, at last—dashed off a tear, with the back of his hand—and cried out— “Read it—read it, William. I have done him wrong. He has a brave heart—a stout one. I must love him. Read it! 'tis in answer to that which I showed to you.” I opened, and read as follows: “Boston—. “I have perused your affectionate letter.” “Damnation!” cried Hammond—“it is'nt so,—he does'nt call it an affectionate letter.” “He does indeed.” “Well, well, go on—I forgive him. It was a good word to begin a period with; and he does'nt much mind what the meaning is, in such a case—go on.” “Your affectionate letter” (I heard his teeth grind, as, I read again; but I went on) “my dear Hammond, with no common emotion. It little matters what the language of friendship be, so that it be the language of friendship; and I am sure that every word, in this letter —(“alluding to mine, I suppose,” said Hammond, his dark, melancholy eye, dilating and flashing fire, as he spoke)—breathes it, in sincerity and truth. I must be allowed, however, to differ from you very materially, in regard to some of the notions and opinions (that) you have been pleased to express. You have written of me, as you knew me, two years ago; and as I knew very well myself. You have continued as others have, to hold the judgment that, then, was formed;—and, as much of it must have, necessarily, sprung from prejudice, it is not at all surprising, that no inconsiderable share of it, should have been partial and incorrect.” “One of your classical periods!” growled Hammond, dashing his arm athwart the table, and sweeping a pile of rubbish to the floor. I looked at him for explanation; but he shook his head, impatiently; and I went on. “I deny altogether, therefore, your assumed presumption, for I cannot believe it to be your deliberate opinion, that I have been wanting, either in resolution or resisting power; while I plead guilty to the charge of flattery, and a constitutional depression or melancholy. I have called the former by a very different name; and its delusions have been so enchanting, that, even now, it is like the remembrance of a sweet and pleasant dream.” “Beautiful!”—whispered Hammond. “What you, my friend, have denominated flattery, I have loved as praise; and, as I believed it, to be the uncorrupted encomium of the good and judicious; the high and honourable testimony of superiour minds, to talented and uncommon merit.” “Not English.” said Hammond, smilingly—“talented! lady Morgan—fudge.” VOL. II. L “I sought after it with unwearied, and perhaps, unreasonable avidity. All that is true. Flattery, if you will have it so, has made me what I am;—” Hammond groaned. “— it has been the gilded spur that has goaded on my ambition, even to the death;” “Very fine!” said Hammond. — “it has roused me from the stupor of indolence, and the despair of ignorance.” “Well balanced,” said Hammond, rather inaudibly; and with a sneering tone. — “it has been my solace, and my support; my comforter, when the sombre, and heavy clouds of affliction swept over me; and my pleasant counseller and friend, when the sunshine of prosperity blazed and brightened around me.” “More of the heart!—more of the heart—if you will,” said Hammond, impatiently—“that sentence is too beautiful, by half, for one in humiliation.” “When men told me, that such an object was attainable by me.” — “What object?” said Hammond. —“though others had failed in theattempt; though, perhaps, I had never seriously thought of it; from that moment, the undying energies of the mind were awakened, and nerved to efforts, which even yourself would have deemed incredible.” “Would I!” said Hammond. “Sometimes, I thought (that) this was done in mockery; but, whether mockery or truth, it was an all-powerful charm with me.” “Written to get in the word mockery—one of his favourites—he never believed any such thing,” said Hammond. “'Tis most true (that) I have craved the praise of fools.” “There! there!” cried Hammond, locking his hands together—“that gives me hope!—that is worth all the rest of the letter.” I looked up—his face twitched, shivered all over, and his eyes were full of moisture. “Because I knew that, in this world, the praise of fools, is by no means to be shunned. Who are the many and the powerful of this world? Who are the wealthy and luxurious? Who are they, upon whose unthinking voices, honour and reputation hang?--- Who are they, that build up large houses, and set forth splendid feasts; and think it no uncommon humiliation, to turn the eye upon starving poverty—” “He means common humiliation;” said Hammond. “—though with a mind enriched with a wealth, beyond the worth of the stars?” “With a wealth had better been left out—beautiful without that:” said Hammond. I looked at him, in astonishment; so coldly critical, so utterly awake, to any inaccuracy, though agitated to death, by his feeling! It was incredible. “Most of all, my dear Hammond; who are to be taught wisdom? and how is it to be taught fools? We live in a world of flattery; and, what was true in Sir William Jones's time, is even true now; that those who please to live, must live to please.” “Poh, poh!—contemptible—” said Hammond. “But I thank God, that I never flattered man, for a gift; and never sacrificed my truth and independence, for a single immunity of purse proud venality, or degarded high birth.” “Nonsense!—worthy of Dr. Johnson himself,” articulated Hammond, through his glittering, shut teeth. “Hang such lumbering melody!” “Of the causes of my constitutional melancholy; or rather, of those which have had a tendency to heighten it. I forbear to speak. You know enough of them, already; and it is now worse than useless, to scar afresh, the wounds, and make them bleed, merely for the pleasure of binding them up again.” “Beautiful!” said Hammond; “that is natural—that is the unstudied language of a full heart.” “Indeed, one is almost sick of hearing of Melancholy, now. She is a prostituted divinity; and no longer walks the darksome grove, clad in purple and pall.— She is disrobed of her attributes; and the beauty, of her mysterious power, is gone for ever! Every unfledged babe of divinity—” “Unfledged babe of divinity—nonsense—say school boy”—continued Hammond, in the tone of one, muttering to himself. —“is now called a melancholy young man—simply because he wears a neck-cloth of white, wreathed, like a bow-string, round his neck; and walks with downcast eye: and has a changeful cheek, of hectick hue. I sometimes loathe myself, when I see this morbid corruption, festering, like a cancer, in the bosom of others: and when the affectation of it appears, I turn away from it, as I do, from the all fearful imagination of Milton's hell-hounds, kennelling in the womb of Sin.” “The work of reformation that you so earnestly wish me to begin, from these candid confessions, appears to my mind, less necessary than you had reason to think—.” “Awkward—” said Hammond. —“The truth is, the more that I have been thrown upon my own resources, the more palpably Necessity, with all her dire train of shapes and spectres, have started up—” “Has started up:” said Hammond. —“and presented themselves. “Herself;” said Hammond. “The devil take your interruptions,” cried I---losing all patience. “I never shall get to the end of it, at this rate.” “Go on, go on;” said he—“never mind what I say. I treat myself in the same way.” —“across my path—so much the more resolute have I grown; and, like Antæus, stronger, from each fall. Think not, because I have been silent, that your friend has been idle.” “Meaning himself;” said Hammond—“badly expressed.” —“Think not, because he has been slow to confess the indiscretion of the past, that he can ever be ungrateful: but above all, think not that his professions of friendship die in an hour, like those sweet and beautiful plants, which spring up in the desert, only to perish under the hot breath of the pestilential simoom.” “Very beautiful!” said Hammond—“very! I know something of that blasted herbage—the vegetation of the wilted heart—go on—go on.” There was a depth and mournfulness in his tone, then, that made me stop, and throw my eyes upon his countenance—it was very solemn; but, I obeyed. “The hours of darkness are passing rapidly away; I think I may truly say, that your best hopes, if not realized, are fast approximating to their goldenest fruition. I rejoice with you, my friend, that you are rising so high in popular love.” “Pshaw!” cried Hammond; “popular love—pshaw! —“I pray God that none of your brilliant visions may be disturbed by the shadow of doubt; the abreviations of time; or the failure of hope. For myself, I am able to endure, if endurance be for good.” “If!” cried Hammond—reverently—“if. Does he doubt that endurance is for good—that it is God's own appointment—and visiting, which we are called upon to endure. If!—but, go on.” —“to drink of the waters of existence, though the unfolded snake writhes among its flowers—” “Ha!—that is poetry;” cried Hammond, locking his hands fervently; and his delighted eyes glared, it appeared to me, for moment, like great carbuncles, with a coloured fire. —“medio de fonte, leporum Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat!” —“Though I have often been deceived by the hollow breath of false counsel; and falser friendship. Yet, I cannot but rejoice, that it has so been: even from such wrecks, we may gather much instruction for the voyage of our lives; this, at least, they may teach us---to avoid the shallow and miseries of others: (full of confusion—said Hammond:) and to hold an onward course, undisturbed by the past, and mindful of the future only.” “What! and disregard the present—no, no friend Wallace: that is a little too classical—hollow breath won't do—the wrecks of what?” said Hammond, inwardly. VOL. II. L 2 “Like you, I have grown tired of acquaintances: and still more, of their correspondence. They are well enough, in every-day life, because they form a part in that great community, with whom, it is fashionable to be on good terms. In the drama of life, they play the inferiour parts of the dramatis personæ: but, after all, are very necessary to its representation. Truly, and sincerely yours, WALLACE. “Tautology,” said Hammond. On the side, a P. S. was written, after the following fashion: “In reading over your letter once more, I have observed your heavy charge, with respect to your opinions concerning the poem, which I sent to you, for perusal and correction. They are altogether incorrect.” “Noble!” cried Hammond—“that is the language of a man.” “I little cared how much you played the severe critick with the work—it was for my good; and it has been for my good—that is the truth.” “Thank God!” said Hammond, devoutly. I looked up —his features were agitated—his nostrils dilated, and red with his breathing, like a race horse, leaping in the wind. “And now, what do you think of it?” said he. “Me?” said I. “Me!—do talk English—what do me think of it!” I was nettled—“I know not what to think of him;” said I; “but his letter is beautiful.” “Yes—quite too beautiful. However, I have great hope of him. There are more errours in it, of punctuation, orthography, grammar, and style—and fewer careful erasures with a sharp pen knife, than in any that I have seen of his, for a long time. You smile— but I'll tell you what it is, William—it is in vain, for any man to tell me, that the writer of a letter feels, when I find his is all dotted, and his is all crossed. A man cannot stop, in the tumult of his heart, to tie a shoe string; or to correct his writing, any more than his conversation; as well might he stop to tie his cravat, or to pick his nails, at a fine drama.” “He then, who blunders most outrageously, writes most feelingly,” I suppose. “Pretty much;” he replied, with invincible coolness; “I would have a man write as he talks.” “That phrase again—it is always in your mouth, Hammond; what do you mean by it?” “Just what I say,” he replied—“I would have a man write, and read and speak, just as he would converse.” “What!—when some, who blunder eternally in conversation, can write elegantly?” “That is false. No man, that blunders in conversation, ever wrote elegantly. Elegance implies ease and gracefulness; and he, who cannot talk with ease, can never write so. A man can no more learn his language by writing it, than he can learn to swim, upon a table. He must always talk first.” “Suppose him to be deaf-and-dumb.” Hammond laughed;—but answered—“then he will write like a deaf-and-dumb man. Nay—I will go further;—there is a certain air of ease about what is natural, so remarkable, that I would undertake to detect, at once, any affectation of style, in the writing of one that I never saw, just as easily as you could, any affectation in his gait or voice. Nay, I do believe that I could tell a left handed man, or a deaf-and-dumb man, by his manner of expressing himself, on paper.” “But suppose that one cannot, whether from invincible timidity; want of experience; or, any impediment, in his speech—express himself in company, would you prohibit him from writing?” “No!—but I would prohibit you from calling him a beautiful or natural writer. There is a witchery; an energy about nature, which are irresistible. One man may captivate you with a movement, which, in another, would distress you. Why? because it is natural in the one; affected in the other. Thus it is with language. You may listen to one that talks naturally; and your heart will beat audible time to his voice: You will feel the sap running through it, like champaigne. Another may imitate him;—a third may use infinitely better words, yet produce no emotion. Why?—with him, they are an artificial language. Yet more. Let me repeat what I have already said. Read to me the writing of a deaf-and-dumb man—a wounded one—or one that had an impediment in his speech; and I will promise you to discover that there is something wrong in it, more readily than you would, from seeing the man.— You are amazed—but I am very serious. What constitutes the beauty of conversation? Is it not a certain simplicity—continual repetition, either of thought or language—redundancy—such as the scriptures perpetually abound with, in matters of tenderness, or eloquence, or pathos. You can bring tears into the eyes of people, in conversation. Would you do the same in writing? How can you hope to do it, but by the same means? Would you truss up, the broken and dislocated language of the heart; and link it together?—and polish it? You destroy the talisman---the magick was in its disorder. You must write then, as you would talk; ---with this qualification---as you would talk—upon the same subject---to the same persons.” “How?---you surely would not have me blunder in writing, merely because I blunder in talking!” “Yes I would. It would stand enregistered against you, till you are ashamed of it. That is one reason. But I have a better. I would prefer that a man should blunder, naturally, than avoid it unnaturally; as I would prefer the natural, lubberly, slovenly case, of any human creature, to affectation; as I would prefer a leftlegged bow, to the step of a dancing master;---as I would prefer a sweet girl's blundering a little, in the hilarity of her soul---to her talking superfinely. Of the first evil, I should have some hope; of the latter, none.” “Then,” said I, “to meet your opinion of a perfect style, one should address the populace; write for a newspaper; or a friend, precisely as he would talk.” “Exactly!”---he replied. “Are you in earnest?” “Yes.” “Hammond, I will not believe you---what, the gossiping of the tea tables---the laboured pleasantry of— the—” “Stop, William Adams---breathe a little.” “The flippancy;”--said I---“would you prohibit improvement?---would you have a fellow stutter on paper?” “Patience, my dear fellow. No---but I would have the improvement begin, where Nature meant, that it should, in the mind and conversation. I would rather hear a man blunder in a foreign language, than talk to me in a set discourse, made up in the closet, from a combination of grammars and dictionaries. Let us put the matter to a test. Suppose that you were telling a pleasant anecdote. Would you not tell it; and write it; and speak it, (if you spoke it at all, in publick) in the same language?” I was much struck with that remark:—and he continued. “But suppose that you have to relate a murder—something that appals the heart,—stiffens the hair —would you adopt a different tone, in pleading to a jury, before the judge of the land, than if you were talking to the same men; having the same object in view; with the same persons listening to you? If you should, you would become unnatural; and your client might be hanged for it. Yet all speakers do this. The moment that they are upon their legs, their voice, tone, emphasis, look, all change. So, in reading—men never read in the language of nature;—and never speak in it, when they can help it.” “What! would you have a man read poetry as he would converse.” “Yes—if he ever conversed in poetry. If he read familiar dialogue, he should read, in the familiar colloquial tone, of every day conversation. Do not your very tone, look, accent—nay, your very pronunciation, change with your subject? You say to me, on one subject, don't do so—but, on another subject, you would say do not---I pray you, do not. Solemnity may be heard now;---and then, a flippant levity---even in the clipping, and hurrying of your words: now, you are emphatick deep---collected;---now, passionate, and thoughtless. If one read a tragedy; let him read it, as he would speak, were he, himself, the sufferer; or the being, in rea life, whose part he is reading. The rule is simple. I do not ask a man to read a scene of wrath and passion from a great drama; or one of deep, sweet quiet in a poem; or one of magnificence and solemnity---as he would talk about his bread and butter---but as he would, if he, himself, were about to be murdered;---or, he, himself, had been hunted, and set upon, like the creature in the play;---or, were he sitting by the dear one of the poet,---who, it may be, was going to her grave, heart broken, in her untasted beauty, unable to move her lips; or---were he abroad, with the poet,—the everlasting skies, blue, blue and boundless---rolling over him--- and the “North wind pealing among her banners.”--- Will not his voice rise---his nostrils dilate---his eyes lighten—his chest heave, when he talks of such things? ---And would you have him, when he comes to speak, and write of them---take down, and, subdue the glorious colouring of Nature;---put her beautiful limbs into the habiliments of fashion;—fetter, and lock, and clasp down the giant, wrist and ancle, upon a bed of iron---lest he should not pigeon wing classically.” I was amazed, I started from my seat. I gazed at him with astonishment, and dismay. “By heaven,” I cried---with the tears in my eyes--- “By heaven! Albert Hammond, my blood thrills at your voice, as to a trumpet call---what are you?---who are you?” “A man!—William Adams---A man!---untrammelled, and unfettered by the schools: A man!--that lived, in ignorance, thank God, till his judgment was able to decide between good and evil for himself!-- A man! who had never been taught---kicked nor cuffed, into a veneration for anything;---and left, in the strength of his faculties, to judge of all men; old or young, living and dead---of ancient or of modern time, without any regard to the opinion of others—” “How full of poetry.” “Poetry! call you that. Man—you do not know what poetry is—it, is something, I must tell you, as I once did General W. after I had been driven from definition, to definition, by him and his rockets. Poetry, is something—of which you cannot even form a conception.” “No. It is not poetry—it is something better. It is down right honesty.” “But pray—have not you written a great deal of what you call poetry?” I said. “No.” “How much?” “Twenty pages, perhaps.” “Twenty pages! Why, I thought that you had written volumes. There are three or four hundred pages in the book that you gave me.” “O,—as to that—I have written two or three volumes, of what others call poetry—nay, better than what they call poetry, in many others.” “Not published—I suppose?” “Yes, it is” “Where?” “Faith, it were rather difficult to tell—with one kind of truck and another.” “Why do you not collect it, and republish it altogether?” “What?” He stared at me, and I repeated the question. “It is'nt worth it”—said he, carelessly; but, with the air of one, whose unconcern is not affected; who means precisely what he says; and does not dream of being doubted. “Really, Hammond, you are an incomprehensible fellow. What do you think of yourself?” “Should you like to know? “Indeed, I should.” “Well then—I think, that, if I live twenty years, I shall have no equal in the United States.' I looked him steadily in the eyes, for a minute, I suppose; and then, seeing that there was no change, or shadow of change in them, I laughed in his face, very heartily—but not so heartily, as I could have wished. He bore it with perfect good humour. “Look you;” said he—“you see what I have done. I have but be gun. So far, I am only in my alphabet. My course of study, for the next ten years is marked out. I know what I am capable of doing. I have an iron constitution; and I can work, three hundred and sixty five days in the year; sixteen hours a day, without sinking under it. Can you find me another man able to do this? You cannot—my frame has been hardened by toil; I was not put to school, before the cartilage had stiffened; and fed to death on dainties; and crippled with study. No! but I was sent out barefooted, and half naked, to face the northern blast; when the snow and ice cut into my flesh, like a hurricane of powdered glass. I was not nourished in a hot house; or washed with warm water; but accustomed to clamber the mountains, before day light; leap through the thin ice; and buffet the torrent, with my Newfoundland dog at my side. I am damnably ugly, as you see. What temptation have I to sin? I am a sensualist, a voluptuary. How can I kennel with strumpets? or gamble my life away, with fools? I am deformed—poor, and proud—I cannot dance; am not sought after by the women; and who can interfere with me in the way of my ambition. Look at me. I can write seventy-five pages of letter paper in a day[8] [8] But the devil himself could'nt read it—with spectacles—Printer. —and can read a volume of five hundred octavo pages through, with ease, in one day.” “And what do you know of it, when you have done.” “Give me one, and try me—more than many a plodder, who would be a month about it.” “Sir—I could have read a volume of Blackstone through in one day; when the book would open of itself, at the place, where a fellow student had been reading it for three months.” “But how could you do these things? They are incredible.” “By system—perseverance. I began to carry the bull while it was a calf.” “How do other people study? I'll tell you. They go to their room, one week with another, through the year, about four days, in each week; and sit there, nodding over their book; talking, or smoking, or thinking of the last night's debauch; or their next night's ball, perhaps three or four hours of a day; during which time, they think it no light matter to read twenty or thirty solid pages. By heaven! I would sooner digest my own heart three times a day—with all its bitterness, than starve my spirit on such a rascally diet.” “I'll tell you what I did. I began with reading one hundred pages a day—of law, history, and miscellany. They occupied me the whole day, and evening. In a few weeks, I found, that I could get through, an hour sooner. I then read one hundred and ten—then one hundred and twenty, and so on, constantly augmenting, till at last, it became as easy, for me to read three hundred pages, as it had been, at first, to read one hundred. And, for about three years, William Adams, I verily believe, that, apart from all that I wrote; and apart, too, from the languages, and some time taken up in visiting my friends—that I averaged full three hundred pages a day, of law and miscellany.” “Heaven, and earth!—how could you live through it!” “Hear me through. By system, temperance, and undeviating regularity. I let nothing discourage me; nothing elate me; nothing disturb me. I first convinced myself, that, if I followed the course, which I had undertaken, it must bring me out, gallantly, at the end; and then, what cared I?—nothing; though I fell, a dead body, with every artery split, and torn—upon the place of victory. I had blood in me. I did not ask to feel my progress every hour—no, nor every day. I did not expect to remember all that I read—nor would I desire it. I never bothered myself with names nor dates; and was willing to read any troublesome affair, two or three times over. I never held it worth my while, to do what was difficult, merely because it was difficult; nor to load my memory, no matter how retentive, or how accurate it was, with the names of cases, pages, or chronological tables; when, after all, I should have vol. ii. M to refer to the books, themselves, however certain I might be, if there should be any dispute; and I learnt, moreover, that, after twenty years of labour, in accumulating a capital in legal science, one must study hard, to keep his original stock good, and hold way with innovation. I learned at the same time, that the sum and substance of all legal acquisition is, after all, not so much a knowledge of what is law, as a knowledge of the places, where it is to be found—not so much, the power of deciding a question, without reference to authorities, as the power of referring instantly, to authorities. I now feel the advantage of it. I cannot study now, as I used to. That is impossible—my time is no longer my own. But, still I am going on, one way and another, in a progress, that startles nobody—while it accumulates, surely; and, in a geometrical ratio.” “But, how could you keep alive? What amusement had you?” “Writing. When I was weary of every thing else; spent with toil, and sore about the temples, with abstraction, I would fall to writing; and my blood would ripple and tingle again, like that of a benumbed creature, asleep, in the sunshine, filled to the lips, with old wine, and charged with electricity.” “But, you surely did not confine yourself to law?” “Oh, no!—that would have killed me.[9] [9] Yes—the law has been the death of many such a fellow—and by confinement too—Ed. By Jupiter!—no wonder, that you stared. Coke upon Littleton, Fearne---and such light reading, thermometer at ninety-five, would soon have put out my pipe, at two hundred pages a day. No—I read, of such gentry, only fifty or one hundred—then, of some other, one hundred more—taking care, however, always to begin in the morning, with that study, which was least agreeable to me; and to leave off, at night, with that, which was most so. This kept me always in tune—my faculties never lost their edge. Do you remember Dr. Doddesly, and his boy?” “Father,” said the little fellow—crying, “take me up in your arms. I cannot walk another step.” “O, yes you can, my child”—said the Doctor. “No, Father, no, indeed; indeed I cannot.” “Here take my gold headed cane, and ride upon it.” “The delighted child took it, and gallopped all round the garden.” “Every faculty of the mind is like that child. Girls, too, will dance all night long to musick; jumping miles and miles, without weariness—who are worn to death by a short walk: soldiers will travel day after day, to musick; and people will travel all day long, in company, without being sensible of distance, or fatigue; when, if alone, or in silence, they would be ready, sometimes, to lie down by the road side, and give up the ghost. All the sensibilities of our nature—all that is lordly and heroick; beautiful, or wise, in man, is like these dancing girls and travellers. Amuse them, and diversify their toil, and they are never weary, nor worn.” “But how managed you to learn so many languages?” “By learning them nearly all at the same time.” “What! all your masters upon you, at once!” “I had none.” “What—no masters!” “No—yet, I ought not to say that. I took a master, for a time only, just to get the pronunciation—in two or three languages: the rest, I managed alone.” “How?” “By discarding dictionaries and grammars, and committing no one rule or word to memory.” “But how could you ever learn one grammatically?” “Just as I have learnt my own. Who speaks it more grammatically? Yet, I do not know one rule of the grammar—and scarcely, a substantive from a preposition.” “It is incredible.” “Not at all. Can you give me a definition of the words that you use?” “Yes.” “No, you can`t—unless in a bungling way:—yet you never use them wrong. Children do the same! How do they learn the meaning of a word? By its use and association. They learn to qualify it every day. So do we. Not one word, out of five hundred, that we use, in our own language, have we ever looked into het dictionary for. Children learn grammar the very same way—by good company and good books.” “You would discard grammar.” “No—I would teach it, imperatively. But I could not begin with grammar—any more than I would teach an infant to walk by diagrams. The one would talk very well, and the other creep quite agreeably, and naturally. I am thinking, though neither understood what part of speech any word was; or in what latitude, and longitude his porringer of milk lay; or, at what angle it was to be assailed.” “Thus have I studied languages. I have learnt the meaning of words by their association—and, in time. I have been able to read many languages. It is another thing, to speak them. Then, it would be well for a foreigner to take up the grammar, soon after being able to read. We can read, you know, what we can`t speak, or write. So we can understand all that an Orator shall say, without being able to say it: many can read Milton—few could have written like him.[10] [10] I hope so, for the honour of human nature.—Ed. ” “Nothing distresses me so much, as the barbarous doctrine of the age, respecting education. It is said, that brass is harder to engrave upon, than sand—but that the engraving will last the longer. It is a very pretty conceit; but, unhappily, a mischievous one, in its application. Lest children should forget easily, they are made to acquire, hardly!—Experience shows, I confess, that a quick memory is not generally a retentive one; and so, with the other faculties. They, that acquire with ease, are too apt to lose with ease—they are inclined to be lavish and neglectful. But is it wisdom to counteract that facility, by throwing difficulties in the way. They talk of making a child labour; and they set him to committing a large volume of latin gibberish— with rules, to which the exceptions are more numerous, than the examples under them: and to “tumbling over” the dictionary. And what is the consequence. First, you make study hateful to him; and, next, an unproductive toil. He searches for a word—ransacks the dictionary—the grammar—the “Key”--the irregular verbs—the declen-sions----and, at last, finds it with fifty different significations. What shall he do? He can only ascertain the meaning, by another process of decyphering the definition; till, at last, wearied and ashamed, he goes to the master, and hears, what should have been told him at first, with a pleasant countenance, what the the meaning of the word is, in that particular case.” “By heaven, you might as well set a child's feet in the stocks; or screw up one of his thumbs in a vice, to prevent the acquisition, from being easy to him, as to do this. No—take your book. Make him sit down by you, with another. Read each word; and make him repeat it. Go over it again. Throw aside the grammar and dictionary. Do not let him look into them, for one year, at least. In a little time, you will find him able to read, and pronounce, with a facility, that will surprise you; and an understanding of what he reads, beyond all your hope. But, do not be foolish —do not expect to make your boy a critical judge of the niceties and delicacies of a language, in forty eight lessons. No—nor in five hundred. That is not to be done, but by a long, and indefatigable application. Enough, it is true, for the common business of life, may be thus acquired, in a quarter of the usual time.— What o`clock is it?” “Half past four, by all that is hungry!” “Pleasant prospect!” said Hammond, ruefully. “We dine at half past three. But you won't mind waiting a day or two, I suppose.” “Upon my word,” said I, “you are the strangest fellow. Do you treat every body so?” “Every body!—no. To people in general, I say— stop—give me a fee—no talk—I won't hear a word— I'm busy. No, no—you must take this, as especially civil in me. You smile. What ails you?” vol. ii. M 2 “I am thinking;” said I. “I—.” “Out with it—don't be bashful.” “No—I cannot—you'll think me vain.” “Think you vain. O, no—I shall not, indeed.” I was obliged to laugh; there was a something irresistible, in his eyes. “What was it?” said he. “I was thinking,” said I, “that we are strangely alike.” “I retract. You are vain now. There is no denying it. You allude of course, not to any personal resemblance; for you are, really, quite a decent fellow; but I—damnation!—I cannot carry on this pleasantry. It drives me mad, when I look upon my own shadow. —What! You look terrified—thunderstruck—come, come—never mind it. I am like you—very like you, indeed.” “Were you quarrelsome, I should say that you were almost the brother of my spirit.” “I am.” “You!—O, no—I know you better. You are full of endurance.” “You are mistaken—the sweltering tyger, under the hottest African sun, is not less so, than I have been.” “Well then, there is but one thing more.—Were you ever the slave of a woman?” “I am!” said the dwarf, in a voice that went to my heart. O, it was so passionate and thrilling, that I would not have had a woman that I loved, hear it, for all the world.” “Is it possible!” said I. “When? where?” “Tomorrow, or, this evening, I will tell you all—I have a load here; (striking his breast, like an anvil;) a heavy load.” “This evening, be it then.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Boston—. “I have perused your affectionate letter.” “Damnation!” cried Hammond—“it is'nt so,—he does'nt call it an affectionate letter.” “He does indeed.” “Well, well, go on—I forgive him. It was a good word to begin a period with; and he does'nt much mind what the meaning is, in such a case—go on.” “Your affectionate letter” (I heard his teeth grind, as, I read again; but I went on) “my dear Hammond, with no common emotion. It little matters what the language of friendship be, so that it be the language of friendship; and I am sure that every word, in this letter —(“alluding to mine, I suppose,” said Hammond, his dark, melancholy eye, dilating and flashing fire, as he spoke)—breathes it, in sincerity and truth. I must be allowed, however, to differ from you very materially, in regard to some of the notions and opinions (that) you have been pleased to express. You have written of me, as you knew me, two years ago; and as I knew very well myself. You have continued as others have, to hold the judgment that, then, was formed;—and, as much of it must have, necessarily, sprung from prejudice, it is not at all surprising, that no inconsiderable share of it, should have been partial and incorrect.” “One of your classical periods!” growled Hammond, dashing his arm athwart the table, and sweeping a pile of rubbish to the floor. I looked at him for explanation; but he shook his head, impatiently; and I went on. “I deny altogether, therefore, your assumed presumption, for I cannot believe it to be your deliberate opinion, that I have been wanting, either in resolution or resisting power; while I plead guilty to the charge of flattery, and a constitutional depression or melancholy. I have called the former by a very different name; and its delusions have been so enchanting, that, even now, it is like the remembrance of a sweet and pleasant dream.” “Beautiful!”—whispered Hammond. “What you, my friend, have denominated flattery, I have loved as praise; and, as I believed it, to be the uncorrupted encomium of the good and judicious; the high and honourable testimony of superiour minds, to talented and uncommon merit.” “Not English.” said Hammond, smilingly—“talented! lady Morgan—fudge.” VOL. II. L “I sought after it with unwearied, and perhaps, unreasonable avidity. All that is true. Flattery, if you will have it so, has made me what I am;—” Hammond groaned. “— it has been the gilded spur that has goaded on my ambition, even to the death;” “Very fine!” said Hammond. — “it has roused me from the stupor of indolence, and the despair of ignorance.” “Well balanced,” said Hammond, rather inaudibly; and with a sneering tone. — “it has been my solace, and my support; my comforter, when the sombre, and heavy clouds of affliction swept over me; and my pleasant counseller and friend, when the sunshine of prosperity blazed and brightened around me.” “More of the heart!—more of the heart—if you will,” said Hammond, impatiently—“that sentence is too beautiful, by half, for one in humiliation.” “When men told me, that such an object was attainable by me.” — “What object?” said Hammond. —“though others had failed in theattempt; though, perhaps, I had never seriously thought of it; from that moment, the undying energies of the mind were awakened, and nerved to efforts, which even yourself would have deemed incredible.” “Would I!” said Hammond. “Sometimes, I thought (that) this was done in mockery; but, whether mockery or truth, it was an all-powerful charm with me.” “Written to get in the word mockery—one of his favourites—he never believed any such thing,” said Hammond. “'Tis most true (that) I have craved the praise of fools.” “There! there!” cried Hammond, locking his hands together—“that gives me hope!—that is worth all the rest of the letter.” I looked up—his face twitched, shivered all over, and his eyes were full of moisture. “Because I knew that, in this world, the praise of fools, is by no means to be shunned. Who are the many and the powerful of this world? Who are the wealthy and luxurious? Who are they, upon whose unthinking voices, honour and reputation hang?--- Who are they, that build up large houses, and set forth splendid feasts; and think it no uncommon humiliation, to turn the eye upon starving poverty—” “He means common humiliation;” said Hammond. “—though with a mind enriched with a wealth, beyond the worth of the stars?” “With a wealth had better been left out—beautiful without that:” said Hammond. I looked at him, in astonishment; so coldly critical, so utterly awake, to any inaccuracy, though agitated to death, by his feeling! It was incredible. “Most of all, my dear Hammond; who are to be taught wisdom? and how is it to be taught fools? We live in a world of flattery; and, what was true in Sir William Jones's time, is even true now; that those who please to live, must live to please.” “Poh, poh!—contemptible—” said Hammond. “But I thank God, that I never flattered man, for a gift; and never sacrificed my truth and independence, for a single immunity of purse proud venality, or degarded high birth.” “Nonsense!—worthy of Dr. Johnson himself,” articulated Hammond, through his glittering, shut teeth. “Hang such lumbering melody!” “Of the causes of my constitutional melancholy; or rather, of those which have had a tendency to heighten it. I forbear to speak. You know enough of them, already; and it is now worse than useless, to scar afresh, the wounds, and make them bleed, merely for the pleasure of binding them up again.” “Beautiful!” said Hammond; “that is natural—that is the unstudied language of a full heart.” “Indeed, one is almost sick of hearing of Melancholy, now. She is a prostituted divinity; and no longer walks the darksome grove, clad in purple and pall.— She is disrobed of her attributes; and the beauty, of her mysterious power, is gone for ever! Every unfledged babe of divinity—” “Unfledged babe of divinity—nonsense—say school boy”—continued Hammond, in the tone of one, muttering to himself. —“is now called a melancholy young man—simply because he wears a neck-cloth of white, wreathed, like a bow-string, round his neck; and walks with downcast eye: and has a changeful cheek, of hectick hue. I sometimes loathe myself, when I see this morbid corruption, festering, like a cancer, in the bosom of others: and when the affectation of it appears, I turn away from it, as I do, from the all fearful imagination of Milton's hell-hounds, kennelling in the womb of Sin.” “The work of reformation that you so earnestly wish me to begin, from these candid confessions, appears to my mind, less necessary than you had reason to think—.” “Awkward—” said Hammond. —“The truth is, the more that I have been thrown upon my own resources, the more palpably Necessity, with all her dire train of shapes and spectres, have started up—” “Has started up:” said Hammond. —“and presented themselves. “Herself;” said Hammond. “The devil take your interruptions,” cried I---losing all patience. “I never shall get to the end of it, at this rate.” “Go on, go on;” said he—“never mind what I say. I treat myself in the same way.” —“across my path—so much the more resolute have I grown; and, like Antæus, stronger, from each fall. Think not, because I have been silent, that your friend has been idle.” “Meaning himself;” said Hammond—“badly expressed.” —“Think not, because he has been slow to confess the indiscretion of the past, that he can ever be ungrateful: but above all, think not that his professions of friendship die in an hour, like those sweet and beautiful plants, which spring up in the desert, only to perish under the hot breath of the pestilential simoom.” “Very beautiful!” said Hammond—“very! I know something of that blasted herbage—the vegetation of the wilted heart—go on—go on.” There was a depth and mournfulness in his tone, then, that made me stop, and throw my eyes upon his countenance—it was very solemn; but, I obeyed. “The hours of darkness are passing rapidly away; I think I may truly say, that your best hopes, if not realized, are fast approximating to their goldenest fruition. I rejoice with you, my friend, that you are rising so high in popular love.” “Pshaw!” cried Hammond; “popular love—pshaw! —“I pray God that none of your brilliant visions may be disturbed by the shadow of doubt; the abreviations of time; or the failure of hope. For myself, I am able to endure, if endurance be for good.” “If!” cried Hammond—reverently—“if. Does he doubt that endurance is for good—that it is God's own appointment—and visiting, which we are called upon to endure. If!—but, go on.” —“to drink of the waters of existence, though the unfolded snake writhes among its flowers—” “Ha!—that is poetry;” cried Hammond, locking his hands fervently; and his delighted eyes glared, it appeared to me, for moment, like great carbuncles, with a coloured fire. —“medio de fonte, leporum Surgit amari aliquid quod in ipsis floribus angat!” —“Though I have often been deceived by the hollow breath of false counsel; and falser friendship. Yet, I cannot but rejoice, that it has so been: even from such wrecks, we may gather much instruction for the voyage of our lives; this, at least, they may teach us---to avoid the shallow and miseries of others: (full of confusion—said Hammond:) and to hold an onward course, undisturbed by the past, and mindful of the future only.” “What! and disregard the present—no, no friend Wallace: that is a little too classical—hollow breath won't do—the wrecks of what?” said Hammond, inwardly. VOL. II. L 2 “Like you, I have grown tired of acquaintances: and still more, of their correspondence. They are well enough, in every-day life, because they form a part in that great community, with whom, it is fashionable to be on good terms. In the drama of life, they play the inferiour parts of the dramatis personæ: but, after all, are very necessary to its representation. Truly, and sincerely yours, WALLACE.</field>

We met, according to appointment. “I promised to tell you,” said Hammond, slowly, after a silence of half an hour; during which, we had set together in his chamber, till it had grown so dark, that we could not see each other's faces; and just then, the door suddenly opened.” “A man entered, and began stirring the fire—“leave it,” said Hammond—“begone, and leave it.” “Shall I bring a light, sir?” said the servant, in a tremulous voice. “No—begone.” “No light!” said I, involuntarily. “No light!” echoed Hammond—“are you afraid of the dark?” I know not what I was afraid of; but, I confess, that I did not much like the opening of the story. Was he afraid to let me see his face, while he told it? I was very silent; and he began. “I promised to tell you,” said he, in a voice so deep and sepulchral, that I should not have known it, had I heard it in another place; and then he stopped. I waited some minutes—oppressed with an unaccountable sensation—to hear it again;—and, at last, his breathing had become so loud, as to alarm me. “Hammond!” said I, going to him, and laying my hand upon his head—“dear Hammond—speak to me— what ails you? What has happened?” He tore away his locked fingers, from his forehead; sprung upon his feet, with a cry of horrour; and pressed my hands, to his heart; as if he would crush them, bone and joint. I could hardly suppress a shriek—and, I observed, that his palms were wet, as if he had been weeping. What!—the Dwarf, weeping!—Hammond, the Dwarf; said I, to myself—O, no—it is only sweat, or blood—it cannot be tears. “Hammond!” I said, again to him, as I really felt, affectionately. He attempted to rise—staggered---and fell back into his seat. “What! what!—was it only you, William;” said he, “only you! Give me your hand!— here! here! (placing it upon his temples, among the damp hair) do you feel any moisture there?” “Yes—the flesh is wet, and the hair saturated.” “Locks of the raven, boy—locks of the raven!— black, and glossy, as her wing—yet—William Adams, they have been touched—there are grey spots upon them—ha!—ha!” He was choking. “Grey spots, my boy; in the form, too, of a human hand!” I shuddered at his voice—and I remembered a strange appearance upon one side of his head, where there were several grey locks, lying amid the jet black hair. `How happened it?” said I—with a feeling of mysterious gloom, that I cannot describe. “Happened it! He came to my bed side, at night, and stood there—and put his cold hand, deliberately, upon my head—and all the moisture of my brain fled from the pressure. I awoke!—and the feeling of the hand, as of cold iron, was there, yet—and—damn it, how your teeth chatter—what are you afraid of! Have you, blood upon your hands? For shame—for shame. Look at me—you see how I bear it. I went to bed, with locks black, black as the plumage of the raven— “black as death.”—I arose, the next day, with grey hair upon my temples—I—” I remembered, now, that Elizabeth had told me, never to speak of that appearance; and, dark as it was, I fancied that I could see the livid hand of the spectre, there yet, like an impression upon wax. “It was not grief—nor sorrow—nor old age, that did it,” said the Dwarf, almost inarticulate, and sobbing, while he spoke—no—no!—but he came to me, in my sleep, and hooped my heart round, and my temples, with rough iron, till I feared to breathe, lest I should be lacerated.---I knew it all---saw it all--the whole process, through my shut eyelids; and, on the morning, when I awoke---I was an old man.” Upon my soul, I could have fallen upon the creature's bosom, and wept aloud, at the sound of his voice. It was like something martial, and alarming, when he began---but, when he ended—ah, it was the mournful, sweet, melancholy, wailing of a fond heart, broken---not the voice of complaint; but the noise of one bleeding to death inwardly. I was willing to turn off his thought from the affliction;—but no—he spoke bitterly, like one that could read my thought, and pity it. “Presently,” said he—“presently. Let us talk of something else, awhile. Only one thing, upon this earth can disturb me—talk to me---say something--- any thing---talk!—will you?” “You are disordered, Hammond,” said I—“You have studied, till your nerves are all vibrating with over tension.” “Oh, no—no, you are mistaken. My time of hard study has gone by.” “But you do study all day long, and nearly all the night. Depend upon it—that—” “I understand you. You would say that continual, and temperate acquisitions of knowledge, are better than those made by violence, and suddenness. Who are the wise, and rich?—they that have been a long while, in amassing their wisdom, and wealth. Yes—I have overworked myself. I shall do better. My new plan of study is better.” “What is it?” “To take up a title in the law; and read every thing upon it, good, bad, and indifferent, that has been written; and make my comments while I proceed—this enables me to detect innumerable errours.” “But, it will destroy you.” “No—I first do my professional business. That is the first thing. Then, I read a certain number of pages in the law: and then, the rest of the day is my own, to employ on miscellany, composition, or languages.” His tone grew more eager and natural, as he proceeded, like one that tries to keep up some delusion, and cheat away the time. “But I cannot understand, how it is possible, to read so fast.” “Habit—practice—nothing more. I have read a volume of poetry through: and written a review of it, while another was writing a letter, at the same table; and I finished, before he did.” “But how do you get over the pages? You skip some.” “Not a syllable. Give me a book—let there be any false English, or even a letter upside down; and I will discover it, as soon as you. I cannot pass it. That is a proof that I not only read every word, but every letter. You pronounce every word, in reading to yourself—do you not?” “Certainly.” “Very well—then you cannot read any more to yourself, in a day, than if you read aloud. Now, I can read five times as much.” `Not pronounce your words!” “No—and what will astonish you yet more, my eye is in advance of my thought, a whole sentence at a time. You smile. Are not your eyes, in reading, always in advance of your voice? Certainly. But how much? That depends upon your practice. I can read to myself at least, five times as fast, as I can read aloud. I save all the cadence, articulation and pauses.” “The more that you read, the more will your eye take in, at a glance, from letters to sentences. The child, when it begins, can never see beyond the very letter, which it is made to pronounce. After a little time, it sees a whole syllable, with the same glance; then, a word —and, finally, more and more, until it can take in a whole line, as easily as it once could a syllable. So it is with me. I read by sentences; and yet, nothing escapes me. You cannot understand this; but, if you reflect, you will find it quite as intelligible—as your story would be, to the reader, who is only able to spell. if you should tell him, that you can see whole words at once. He would not believe you. You cannot believe me. But why do you look at me so earnestly; your eyes are full of compassion and anxipty.—I—.” “I am sure, my dear Hammond,” said I, deeply affected at the manner—it was so like one trying to drive away sorrow and madness, by an affected hilarity, “that you are nervous, from excessive application.” “No—No, I am not, nervous! Albert Hammond nervous! No—no, it is something worse than that—but talk—talk—talk—as fast as you can—my blood is curdling—come nearer—yes, yes—hush!—do you hear nothing—Ah!—what is that? There! there!—Hush! I told you so—now you will believe me!—Hush! hush!” As he said this, he leaped upright—and I—I knew not where I was! I felt all the childish terrour of a nursery. “Hammond!” said I, feigning to be indignant, while in truth, I was frightened; “Come back!—come back! and let us reason together, like men—what is this?” “What!—did he not touch you!—didn't you feel the hand?” Some minutes passed, before I could prevail upon him to sit down. I stirred the fire then; and his countenance in the red flashing of the embers, when the disturbed sparks rushed, like a torrent of fire, up the chimney, was frightful and appalling. Had the devil himself, been there, he could not have set more naturally upon his haunches; or looked through his huge knotted fingers, with more fiery and troubled eyes. “Thunder and lightning!—did I not tell you!” As he said this, he plucked out a handful of his hair and threw it upon the red hot coals; a quick flash followed. I began to stir the fire. “Let the fire alone! will you,” he cried. I was angry. “Hammond,” said I, “you are mad.” “And you would leave me,” he replied, in a voice that went into my heart.---“I did'nt leave you, William, when you were mad. No, I am not mad. Sit down and listen to me, patiently. You ought not to have stirred the fire. It is about his hour; and he might have been near us, you know. But fear nothing, now ---he is appeased---they are appeased---the hair quieted them:---No, no, never stir the fire, when you are with me, at this hour. Why don't you talk? Do talk, William.” I felt assured now, that he was disordered;---but, as I had been so, myself, I attempted, for half an hour, to lead him into some kind of conversation, that would interest him; but, all the time, he held my hand like a vice, to his bosom;---and his breath came out, as from the furnace of an overlabouring heart. “I shall be obliged to leave you,” said I, at last— The pressure grew tighter. “I am sure that I have now found the cause of your illness. Law will be your destruction. Will you write me, after I am gone?” “Yes.” “May I depend upon it?” He threw away my hand—“May you depend upon it!—I—“Look you,” said he, recovering his natural manner, for a moment---“I have told you that I love you---and respect you. Is that enough? If I appear to neglect you, it will be appearance only. Do not misunderstand me. I do not say it, to appease you. You are my friend. I know it—I feel it. Would you not rather see me ten or twenty years hence—a”— “You talk very calmly of ten or twenty years.” “I am obliged to talk calmly of it. It is the end of my covenant. I am ready to die, then. Do you think that great men are made in less time than rich ones?--- great statesmen, in less time, than good tailors, or bricklayers? Twenty years are little time enough, to make any man master of any trade; and I won't be an understrapper all my life. Would you not rather see me, ten or twenty years hence, occupying a higher station in the world, as an honest and able man (I do not say lawyer, lest you should think it a contradiction in terms) though I had talked with you, or written to you, a little less frequently; than to see me in an humbler situation, in consequence of a more frequent indulgence, in what is really my chiefest pleasure, conversing with them that I love, either with my mouth, or pen?” “Yes.” “Let me go on then, as I am going, night and day; and give yourself credit for the relinquishment of a portion of your own right, in favour of friendship and ambition.” The moon now arose, in a troubled, and beautiful sky, full of scudding and tumultuous clouds; hurrying over the fathomless blue, like a great fleet, driven over the ocean, in a hurricane. I could just see his outline--- and movement---but nothing of his features, where he sat. The whole earth too, was covered with new fallen snow. “How beautiful!” he cried---`the gallant moon, and the innumerable stars---the deep serenity of the revolving heaven---the profound repose of the whole earth---- the hushed and awful spirit of the universe;—all creation holding its breath before God. Lord! what is man, that thou art mindful of him.” Never before had my heart heaved, in worship, as it did then, while the voice of Hammond arose, louder and louder, in the darkness, like one dreaming in his sleep; or praying inwardly. “Go on, for mercy sake, dear Hammond,” said I, “I could sit, and listen to you, for ever.” “No, no, I dare not, in truth, William. I dare not. He is there; there, in the presence of the Almighty, standing upon the wind. No, no—I dare not uncase my heart again. I dare not unbuckle the harness, and ligatures about it, lest it should sunder, and fall apart, for ever. No, I must keep it ribbed in armour; ironed all around; be temperate, very temperate all my days, and labour to make up for lost time; and recover, if I can, the wasted hours of my youth. I am growing old, William Adams; and I would not willingly die, till I had done something, to show my gratitude to God, for all that hath happened to me, whether in affliction, shame, or humiliation. And if I do—O, if ever a man VOL. II. N slept unquietly in his grave, I shall.—If ever the turf were upheaved; and the spirit of a buried man ever came out, to weep for his transgression, and shudder in the cold moonlight—mine will! So, if for no other reason, I pray heaven to spare me yet a little while, and my friends to have compassion upon me.—Come! come! talk!” “But why, dear Hammond,” said I, “why devote all your faculties to the law? May I talk upon that?” “To the law! No, I do not. I will not. But, by this I mean, (speaking very rapidly,) statutes, precedents, reports and commentaries. To them, I shall not confine myself. But to law, in its magnificence and amplitude—covering all the earth alike, just as that snow there—the mountain and the valley, the rich and the poor—to that, I shall; for, to my thought, every earthe ly science and accomplishment may be made subordinate to the consummation of a lawyer, and advocate. Nay, other studies are a relaxation; and, the worn and jaded mind, which might, otherwise, tire itself with inaction; or slumber away its power, under pretence of recruiting it, after a day of toil upon the law, will find comfort, warmth, aliment and exhilaration, in lighter and more passionate studies.” “But why not write? Why not give to us, annually, some work of the imagination—the mere revelling of your leisure hours?” “Perhaps I shall—I am constantly writing.” “Yes—but I do not mean matter of law, or history, or politicks.” “What do you mean?” “Poetry.” “Poetry!—(he laughed scornfully) “my oath, William, my oath! No, I shall never publish any more poetry.” “But you will write it?” “Perhaps I may.” “You have written.” “Not a line, since I said that I would not write any more, Indeed, William, the thought will run through my heart, now and then, with a sweet, brief ripple, thrilling, that I might do somewhat for amusement; though I did not write poetry. And I have nearly resolved, to set about something in prose, merely as a sort of receiver for the luxuriant vegetation, and brilliant herbage, that will spring up, you know, in hot hearts, when left untrodden a long time, to fatten with corruption.” “I hope you will, by heaven!” said I. “Nay, do not swear.” “That is not swearing—it is—at any rate, not profanity, but devotion. But you talk of swearing, you! Advice comes with a good grace from you, to be sure.” “Why should it not?” said he. “Who has a larger fund unappropriated than I. It has been accumulating for years. Shall I regard it as a special deposit, neither to be used, nor circulated. No—I prefer putting it abroad—it may profit my neighbour, though it should'nt me.” “But you are very profane,” said I, “I am glad that you mentioned it. You make my blood run cold sometimes.” “Do I? I am sorry for it. I used to be terribly so, William; and I shake when I look back on the fierce blasphemy, that I have uttered—once, in particular, when the heavens were all on fire; and I saw my own shadow in the clear water below me—I wonder that the blue lightnings had not rushed into my heart, all at once, and exploded there. Yes—and once too, when I was rebuked for it, foolishly, by one that had no authority; and less diguity; and threatened too—I, I remember that I took out my watch, in defiance; and swore, till I was hoarse and black in the face; but that was the end of it. I, afterward, resolved to break myself of it; and gave them that knew me, full leave to strike me, where ever I was, as hard as they pleased, and when they pleased, whenever I committed an oath. They were glad of the chance, I do assure you; and, before the week was out, I was beaten black and blue; for I had an account to settle with each, every day; and often for the same oath.” “You will write then,” said I. “I may.—If I should attempt any thing of the sort, it will startle you, I am sure. You know my ambition. I cannot play a light game, even with the battledore and shuttlecock of the fancy. I know not what I may do; my time is constantly taken up; and I shall never neg ect my business; but, as I trifle none of it away; and write, I believe, with unprecedented facility, it is possible that I may attempt something in the way of a novel, or a history, or law, or physick; or divinity. So don't be terrified, if you should chance to detect me, in any thing new, at home, or abroad. Yes—I will write you, if we part—whenever my heart is full. You will remember me, as I shall you. Do that, and it is all that I ask—William.” I started broad awake. I looked all about the room. Yes, it was the voice of Hammond; but how different— my blood tingled with it. “Say on,” said I. “You asked me, if I were ever in love. Let me tell you the truth. I have been---once, devotedly---and two or three times, after a fashion.” “The old malady!” said I; “the true love of a woman, who never loves but one—at a time. You are a believer in first love, I suppose.” “Of course.” “That they are eternal!” “Certainly.—Why what a heretick you are!” I was delighted, at the result of my efforts, and determined to keep him, for a time, away from the subject, that had brought us together; and, if I succeeded, never again, upon this earth, to mention the duel or the hair, in his presence.” “But how do you manage,” said I. “How many first loves can a person have?” “O, the number is unlimited; but then, you can only love one at a time! Thus, I love to-day—I am a woman—I love, with all my heart and soul; that is my first love; and, of course, eternal; but, a year afterward, I love again. I love differently; for, the passion is never twice alike; O, then I find that I was mistaken before. I thought myself in love; but I was not then; now I am. But a third—a fourth—a hundredth happens; and the first love will always be found, by a beautiful confusion of speech, common enough among women, to mean only—the last one. You see that I am profoundly orthodox—the creed at my finger-end—tenets, doctrine and all.” “You are very bitter;” said I. “Bitter!—poh—how can one be bitter upon women? Is not a woman's last love, always, her first love?” “Shall I tell you what one, that knows you, has said of you?” “No—I don't desire to hear it. Why did she tell you? That it might reach me. She might as well have told me to my face.” “Nay—be patient—it is no mighty matter, after all. She says that one would think, to hear you speak of women, sometimes, that they were your scorn and detestation; but that, at your heart, no human being was ever so passionately devoted to them—none so true to them, in trial, and in—” “Stop!” cried a voice, close to my ear. I looked up. An ugly shape stood frowning, with his face almost touching mine. It was Hammond—but convulsed from head to foot. “Stop!” said he, more mildly. “There is only one woman, upon the round earth, capable of saying that; and I will not hear her named now. I—” He stopped for a moment; turned round, facing the sweet moon; and, crossing his arms over the back of his high chair, sat down, resting his chin upon them. I watched every motion—he would twist and writhe, at such moments, as if he had'nt a bone in him; and, oftentimes, I have wondered how he managed to get his legs and arms entangled, as I have seen them, when they were all in a snarl; knotted and intertwined, like fat serpents. He had the faculty too, I have half persuaded myself, of dilating; or, rather, of extending and contracting them, like earth-worms, at pleasure; for, I have seen him suddenly start up, and swing his arms about, like a tall man—and then, bundle them up in his bosom like coiled rattle-snakes.” “You know,” said he, slowly, “that I am not remarkable for personal beauty. But it has now and then so happened—curse it, how I hate to talk of such things— but you must know me, thoroughly; and I will tell VOL. II. N 2 them—it has happened, two or three three times, in my life, that women have been in love with me. William Adams, you are laughing at me.” “No.” “You are—I can tell by your breathing.” “'Pon my honour, I am not. I have known stranger things.” “Yes—women have loved blackamoors—apes—fourfooted beasts. William, the breath rattles in your nostrils—but—but—one evening, I happened to meet a strange little girl, with melancholy, dark eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.—that had been deeply in love.” “I was in exactly the humour for trying an experiment. I had heard, that the heart, sore with recent disappointment, is most susceptible; that, once inhabited by love—the heart of a woman cannot remain vacant; that, the chambers of the soul, will be filled, after one riot has been had in them; that the incense and warmth of love, once felt, the spirit of woman lies with its mouth open, and eyes shut, and hushed heart, for ever and ever—contented, with no other nourishment, than love. Is it so? you have had experience.” “It is.” “I believe you; and, so far as my little experience may go, I would prefer attacking the proud heart, when first humbled; the sore one, when just crushed, and smitten---the cold one, in its first thaw; the tender one, in its first weeping, than at any other time; that is---I would prefer to be the successour of him, that had first smitten, crushed, thawed, humbled or distressed it.” “If you were in pursuit of a heroine”---said I. “Aye---or a woman.” “But not a wife. The women of Byron, for instance.” “O, no,” he replied; “the women of Byron---poh! they are women for mistresses---not for wives. Byron has no idea of that sweet, holy, mute, fervour—that passionate stillness of a pure heart—that, which carries a woman, with the untrusted, untold, unhinted affliction of her heart, into the grave—that!---O, I have seen it!---her heart was breaking, but her mouth was patient as death.” “Go on;” said I; and my own tears fell upon my hand. “Well, well---I frightened that sweet girl. But soon after, there was such a melancholy loneliness in her eyes; her hair was so wonderfully dark and beautiful, in its wet luxuriance---her foot was so pretty---her round, sweet voice, so touching and plaintive---curse it, William, I can't go on—I—” “Don't swear.” “Well then, I won't. At first, as was very natural, she shuddered a little, when the flesh of our hands touched but, after a time, she began to tolerate it. And one Sunday she suffered me to hobble along by her side, in company with one other couple, an amiable, quiet woman, and a red headed fellow; and to sit by her under a tree, for an hour or two. I contrived--- it was like filing off one's own fetters with a jack-knife ---to cut the initials of her name, and my own (so that no human being could decypher them) upon that tree, beneath which we sat. She was marvellously disposed to be sentimental; and the dirty green puddle at our feet, stagnant with vegetable corruption; and swarming with insects and vermin, we contrived to pass off, upon our own senses, for a rivulet of blue crystal; and the damp turf---with the loose earth, and a tree full of bugs and spiders, over our head, for all that is beautiful in a country life. You have been in the country—after a long anticipation—with the holiest passion for rural comfort. Did'nt you feel, as if you had been running yourself to death, when hard pushed for money, to drive some slow winded fellow, to an adjustment of accounts---and then found---look me in the face, will you---that you were the debtor. How like going to enjoy yourself in the country! You are obliged to be delighted, enraptured with it, you know---to be orthodox---or you never will be permitted to open your mouth again, in the company of women---or to talk of a novel, a poem, or love.” “Wading through loose earth, high corn, and wet grass, after berries,” said I. “Aye, and visiting, on some great, unmanageable, and hard trotting horse, or afoot, over cornfields, and ditches, through bramble and briar—some neighbour living in the next county.” “And then, led out to take tea, under what is called a bower---an arbour, or some such contrivance, dripping with wet, or smothering you with dust, at every blast of the wind---and wormeaten leaves, or worms.” “And bugs, and musquitoes,” I added. “Catterpillars and cream---colds, catarrhs---and rain storms---no books---no conversation---no company---no news---no fresh meat, no market.” “Let them that like it, live in the country—eternally—if they can,” continued he. “But, let me leave it, now. In time, this girl began to exhibit symptoms that alarmed me, whenever I approached her.” “Agitated---terrified! I suppose,” said I---“very natural.” “What! quizzing me Adams---by heaven, you had better set your foot upon a bed of live coals.” “Patience, man—don't get in a passion.” As I spoke, the moon broke out, all at once, from the sky, as if she were descending---shone all over his face; and I sat, with my hands upraised, to wonder at his countenance. It was pale as death; and his blood-coloured lips were wet and glittering. “In time, I began to tremble too. She was imprudent; and I had just come enough to my senses, to feel that I was dancing upon a precipice. Prepare yourself. I am cautious---not easily deceived---care little for the love of woman---of some women, I mean. Are you prepared?” “I am.” “She loved me!—nay, do not move your hands. I can see you biting your lip. You do not believe it possible. But—it is true---ugly as I am, that beautiful creature loved me, truly, passionately;---not, I am sure, as she had loved a scoundrel before, that toyed and trifled with her innocence---breathed poison upon her lips,---and death into her heart; but, with a love, such as I would wish to inspire in a wife; with awe and tenderness. I was very sure of her—and I began to look about me, in right good earnest, and ask myself, if it were lawful to perpetuate a breed of monsters —what will not love do!—I persuaded myself that it was. But her heart—could I trust to it? Her head ---was it such a head, as I should be proud to see, one day or other, ruling my household; educating my children?—Don't laugh, William, I cannot bear it---you are thinking what they would look like.---I'll tell you —like over-grown toads, squatting about the nursery--- I know it. Yet---I doubt if there might not be some pleasure in begetting toads---as much at least, as in begetting slaves---like your Virginians.” “What do you mean, sir?”—said I, in a heat— “Sir—I mean this; that your young Virginians, when hard pushed for money, will run in debt, on a credit of nine months; and get all their renewals for nine months.” “And what do you infer from that?” “This---that they may pay in stock”— “Stock---what is your meaning?”— “Their own flesh and blood, man.—Damn it, William Adams, don't I know the Virginians?—Don't Iknow that the best blood among them, has mulattoes and quadroons, for half brothers and sisters.—” “Hav'nt I seen a fellow there, gambling for his own children—deliberately sinning, that the fruit of his sin, might be born in season, to meet a note? Have I not seen mother, and babe, at the breast---sold---at publick auction! Gracious God!—what a state of morality? Do you wonder that a man, humpbacked, and hateful as I am, should have a passionate longing to perpetuate himself; to give an inheritance so hateful, to the innocent and beautiful, unembodied, and unappropriated spirits about us;—as that a stout hearted Virginian, high in blood, and ready to die for religion and liberty---should sell the fruit of his own loins to slavery?”— “Well---well—go on,” said I---“how did your love affair terminate?” “I'll tell you. Just when I felt quite secure of her, that red headed fellow, who, I had told her once (with her own approbation) was a fool—cut me out. She had engaged to go into the country, about a dozen miles; and gave me an invitation to go with her. I could not---for, on horseback, I have an unlucky aspect—in the day light. But I agreed to meet her, on her return, in the evening, by accident. I set out, in season:---but, missing stays on my road; stumbled, and swore; and finally, came back to a house, that I had passed an hour before, to inquire the way. I hitched my mare at the gate, and waddled up to the door---the dog set upon me, of course—the very geese and cats— and the poor mare, terrified, perhaps, at my shadow; for, like Alexander, I had not dared to let her see it, when I mounted her—slipped her bridle, and set off, on a fine, free gallop, into the wood. Nothing could have been more opportune. I am quite a philosopher, at such moments. So,---I set off after her, half determined to cut her throat, or beat out her brains; but how could I?—was'nt I in love?—and since Petruchio's time, there has been little efficacy or sentiment in such freaks. After some difficulty, I overtook the animal; forgave her; mounted; and pursued my way, just exactly in the pleasantest humour, that ever man was in. I soon met the party---Mary Anne had a beau at her side. We exchanged salutation---but hers---bless her foolish heart!----was quite too stately and freezing ---and, no matter what---it sent a chill to my heart: and, I was half a dozen times, on the point of setting off in another direction; but I forebore, and, on we rode, side by side, without speaking one word, till we arrived at the gate.” “Good night!” said I, sullenly wheeling my horse. “Good night, sir,” said she, with a cold peevishness. “Home I went---and spent, you may be sure, a rather uncomfortable night. The next day, I was unable to think of anything but red hair; and “good night, sir.” Yet, I was not of a nature to be trifled with; and could I have been sure, that she did not care a fig for me---I should have done one of two things, before I slept— strangled her red-haired lover—or looked her, in the face, once---but once---and left her, for ever. But I was in doubt. “Perhaps,” I said to myself---O, how sweet are such wilful, treacherous delusions!—“perhaps, I have wounded her—let me give her an opportunity to tell me so—and then, if we must part---why, let us part.” “So, the next night, I went again. Red-head was there; and with that beautiful tact; that instinct of coquetry, with which women are born;-- that, which will set a babe at the breast, if a female, twinkling with her eye, and hiding her head, while a great lubber of a boy will look you full in the face, with a stupid honesty---she began, immediately, to be particularly attentive and delicate to Red-head, after the fashion of the very few heroines that she had ever read of---- calling him aside, to say nothing to him, in a whisper; giving him flowers---with a mysterious word or two--- hang him!—” “All that was foreign to my taste---in my situation, I mean---how it would have been, in his, I know not---and when I had born it quite long enough, I bade her good night, in earnest.” “About a week after, while I was yet sore---confoundedly sore, I heard that she had accepted a ring from Red-head; and was engaged to be married to him.” “I staggered, or rather, my heart did---within me, at the news. It was not that I cared so much about losing her---or that another should win her. But, it was, that I had lost her in such a way; and to such a fool. At first, I thought of counteracting it:---but that, I soon found, to be unworthy of me; a few hot, hot, scalding tears fell from my eyes,---when I thought how mightily I had been abused;---how deeply I had loved her---and how utterly unworthy of my love, she had been---and then, it was all over. By heaven! Adams, much as I loved her; so truly great and pure was my love, that, I do believe, I should never have married her---merely that I might not expose her to ridicule. But, I knew her temper. I knew that she respected me;---and I knew, that, after a few irregular pulsations, her heart would settle down again, if it had time, into the right place. It did. At the end of another week, she had returned the ring to Redhead; packed him off; and sent for me---nay, had come, herself, to see me, actually, at my own store, in her imprudence; though one, that knew me, had said---beware of that!---he is not the man to endure such things: ---he would never marry a woman, who had no respect for herself, however she might love him---however he might love her.” “We met---it was on the steps of a friendly house: ---a sweet star-light above us. I held her hand. It trembled. “It may happen again,” said I. “Never”---was her reply. “I felt no rapture. I feigned none. In a little time, during the visit, I had no opportunity to tell her my heart. But I neither pawed her about, nor slobbered her with caresses---fool that I was---how little I knew then of her true nature.” “My affections are engaged,” said she, sobbing, as if her dear little heart would break.” “Merciful beaven!---what could I think of such a woman! Had she been winning me to a precipice--- only that she might play out the part of some heroine of a novel, by telling me, at last, that her affections were engaged.” “My manner instantly changed. Both of us had wept---both. But I arose, like one that had done all his duty, regarding her as a creature sanctified to another, prohibited to me, for ever.” “Again we parted, friends—the truest friends in all the world!—and tremendously disposed to the heroick, and unearthly. She had many suitors; but, after hovering about her awhile, and scorching their beautiful wings, they left her; or were scorched off;—and I had another summons. I dreaded to hear it, indeed I did —but I so loved her yet, that, had I heard it coming up from the bottom of the ocean, I would have plunged after it.” “We met, and were very happy. My arm encircled her beautiful waist; and, as I sat by her, she put her wet lips to my forehead—my blood thrilled, and I pressed her to my heart---with no rudeness---no fierceness—no—I loved her too tenderly—so tenderly, William, that, for awhile, I forgot my own ugliness, and held myself, as I touched her, to be “a marvellous man,” and fitted for companionship with her loveliness. Yet---a change followed---what was the cause, I know not---women are so capricious---my phlegm, or my philosophy;---my suspicion, for I could not feel that undoubting, unqualified, noble confidence in her, that I had once felt---it required time and trial to restore it---and I told her so---these might have been the cause;---but after thought, more experience among women have explained the mystery. I was not ardent, rash, impetuous, impudent enough. I did not fendle, nor lip her enough---my manner was too reverential. What woman would'nt have been offended ---to be treated, at such a time, as if she were not a woman. I could scarcely breathe, when her hand was upon my forehead; and my hair thrilled---I could feel it, to the root---when her fingers went through it: and my arm---that very arm---which enwreathed her fine waist, ached with pleasure---and yet---I believe in my soul, that I never touched her lips---nay, I do not know that I ever did touch them, during all my love. Zounds! what a bitter sarcasm upon woman! How ignorant I showed myself to be---though I was twice her age nearly, and a thousand times more experienced:---and how cruel, it was in me, not to understand her. I loved her too purely---with a passion too intellectual. I visited her, as one enshrined, to whom incense should be burned with our eyes shut---and our hands crossed upon our bosom. Mine was love; but she knew it not. It was not that love, of which she had read in novels, and poetry; nor experienced; nor seen upon the stage. I neither whined at her; nor fell upon my knees, in a set speech; nor pawed her about; but I loved her, as women ought to be loved, with tenderness and truth; trembling to the heart, when I touched her forehead, or when our arms intertwined. But that was not love —not that love, which she looked for. She was like some woman, that has never seen a madman, or a murderer, except upon the stage---or, in a novel,---who, if she should see one in real life,---would be sure to vol. ii. O call it unnatural, if he did not talk like the man in the novel, or act like the man on the stage.” “O,” said I—half delirious with the deep tranquillity of my own spirit---“how very happy I am!—” “I heard a faint whisper, in reply. “It may happen again, dear,” said I. “It may---and if it should— O, I know not what will become of me!” “Her tears fell, like hail, upon my forehead, as I lay upon the sofa; and she stooped over me. She assured me that it could not happen again.” “Yet it did!---by heaven it did!---in less than half an hour, a friend of mine, who had been making love like a two and forty pounder, in the next room, on a sofa ---came to me; took my hand; and, squeezing it affectionately---and be hanged to him —” “Speak!” said I---“out with it, Joe.” “She says that she never can love you, Hammond; that she respects you; and—and—” “O, very well,” said I, quite unconcernedly---entering the room where she remained, as I spoke---and addressing myself to her, as if nothing had happened ---“good night, ladies!---good night, Miss!----Mary Anne!---good night.” “I left her, but she still haunted me. She loved me, if ever woman loved man. She loved me, I am sure; but she, herself, did not know it. She was beset by fools; and worried to death by puppies;---and I began to get distressed in my business, about the same time. My dear friend Joe, my counseller in matters of love; the most discreet, sage, and virtuous of men,---having been grievously captivated in the same neighbourhood; and having seen the sweet Mary Anne weeping, in consequence of some unkindness in his dear one (about a pair of pretty little slippers of her own, which she had managed to exhibit, at an unlucky moment, upon the mantle piece---the little devil!---while the big feet of his dear one were in view) and having gone home with her---and cried, it is probable, all along the road with her---began to retract certain notions of matrimony, which he had been repeating, for several months, for my edification—while there was a prospect of my marrying.” “Let me give you a specimen of it.” “The most imprudent thing, in the world,” said he--- dutifully, as we rambled along by a mud puddle, walled in, which was called a canal, there---“you must not think of it.” “Of what?” said I. “Of getting married?” “Of getting married!---getting devils!” “Of course,” said he, bowing. “Should I chuck him into the canal? I had a great mind to. Nobody would have missed him, except his tailor, and washerwoman, at quarter day---and it might have saved them something---in the long run--- at least, in shoe leather.” “But what is your objection?” I continued, smothering my passion, and looking him in the face---the smirking rascal---“Late marriages make early orphans; you know. Dr. Franklin recommends early marriages.” “True---and, at the same time, he says, that a young widow, with half a dozen children---that was in his time; in the early settlement of America---was considered a fortune.” “The devil take the young widow; and all her children; and Dr. Franklin; and yourself, into the bargain: none of your ready made families for me! I tell you what 'tis, Joe:---it's a d----d barbarous thing, for a man to marry late. He is sure to die, leaving a family of uneducated helpless creatures, behind him.” “True---but with money to educate them---and estate to make them sought after,” was his reply. “By whom? Scoundrels, and fortune hunters. It is a curse to leave an estate in a family. The boys are spoiled by it; and the girls are either married for their money, or are always miserable, under the suspicion that they were. How can they ever know, certainly, that they have been married for love? For my part, I hope to leave my wife pennyless. You need'nt laugh, Joe.---It is easy enough done, I admit, with such acquaintances as I have.” “Humph;” said Joe, pulling his hat over his eyes: “and put her up for sale, to the highest bidder,” he added, “to obtain bread for herself, and her little ones.” I shuddered---my heart wheeled about, and threw two or three somersets, before I could get my breath. “No,” said I---“I will strangle her first, on my death bed. Gracious heaven! what can be done? Women sell themselves every day---to the old and decrepid, and hateful; and the publick look on, without any emotion-- without one pang; or one cry of detestation upon the unnatural crime. Why do they not brand her, who sells herself to an old man for his life; a few short years---as they do her, who sells herself to a young man, for a year; a month, or a night? O, it makes my blood boil, to look about this fair world, and see what women have done, and are doing, in the light of heaven, for money. It is not marriage---it is coupling. The blessed institution of marriage should be sacred---inviolable. No power on earth should have the right to break it up. Publick policy requires that both parties should consider it eternal; that they may have the better reason to be kind, and patient, and forgiving, to each other; and to their children. The law will not permit a conditional marriage; and society calls it infamy; and the fruit infamous; nay, the law does the same. It may be doubted then, whether there be any legislative power, existing, to destroy a marriage---for what the parties cannot do, themselves, by a positive stipulation, no other power shall do for them. Whence can there come a power of divorce? There is no such power. A marriage, lawfully had, must be for ever:---on what ground shall you proceed to grant it?---ill temper---unfruitfulness, adultery? You offer a premium, and reward, for ill temper; a crime; and from indulgence---you take away the chief restraint. And yet---O, how reasonable men are, and women too---they will permit a young woman to sell herself; or a young man to sell himself, like a beast, to the pleasure of another, who is old, and infirm; sick, and nasty---without reproach, or infamy; when, from the very nature of the contract, it is only for a few years. Shame on them!” “All very well,” said Joe, musing---“but I don't see what it has to do with the subject.” “True,” said I, “but to-morrow evening, I have to maintain, that our legislatures have no power to grant a divorce; and I was willing to practise a little in advance.” “Our conversation ended, with the most vehement protestation, on his part, against my marrying at all; particularly, that woman---and, more particularly, at that time.” “That was all very well; but, about a month afterward, I saw him get out of bed, one morning, earlier, by an hour, or two, than he ever did before; and go about some mysterious operation; while I lay, and watched, pretending all the while, to be asleep. It was of a Sunday morning. Not a thought of his heart had ever been a secret from me, till about that time. First, he twisted his legs (he called them legs---and used them, as I am a living man, for the purpose of walking and dancing) into a pair of silk stockings; and then stuck the ends of them---the lower ends---into a pair of tight new morocco shoes, that made him gape as he did it.” “That was enough---I turned over, and went to sleep; sure that he was in love again, up to his eyes. But little did I suspect the truth. My dear friend---my own dear, dear friend, was in love with my own mistress. Several little pleasantries had passed between them---a ring---which he stole from her hand, at the gate; and which she sent for afterward; a card case--- and some other matters, so that, I was not absolutely thunderstruck; when, having led him along the canal again, soon after, I found his memory, or opinion, respecting early marriages, so cruelly disordered, that I'll be hanged if he did not take the affirmative, and use my own argument in favour of them, before we returned. So much for Mary Anne.” “What became of her?”---said I. “Gone the way of all flesh,” he answered. vol. ii. O 2 “Dead!---poor heart---is it possible?” “No---married—” “Married! Why didn't you marry her?” “For four reasons. I was too poor---she, in too great a hurry--I would'nt have her---and she would'nt have me.”</field>

So I would'nt say of you, that.” “O, hang your apologies---they are more insufferable than your sarcasms.” “But have you ever loved another?” “Yes---heart, and blood, and pulse?” “Whom?” “I won't tell you.” “Pretty fair---faith.” “Yes.” “Well, well--was it that widow, in Virginia?” said I. “No---but how came you to know any thing about her?” “I heard some strange stories about you, there.” “Never mind them---tell me about her. What did you hear?” “That you fell in love with her, shockingly.” “No, no! that's all a mistake; that fall was from the gig. We were tandem; and one day, I had just made an agreement with my fellow traveller, that, if any thing should possess the horses, while he was driving, he should hold on upon the reins, so long as he had a limb upon his body; and I would never leave the whirligig, while there was life in me. It was a most providential agreement; for, in less than ten minutes, the rear horse, a powerful fellow, threw up both of his great, clumsy heels, into my face—cut through our iron dasher—stove an umbrella—shattered my knee pan; and gave me a fall—that was the fall of which you speak—nothing more.” “No—there was more bruising than that.” “Well then, let me tell you the truth. She was a charming woman. Her husband had been a charming man; but had killed himself by hard drinking. I had heard the finest character in the world of him— but nothing of that—from his own brother—And when I saw the widow, clouded and sorrow stricken; weeping, absolutely, as if he had just died---it went to my heart. I cannot deny it---it did---and I undertook to console her. She was a religious woman; and not to be comforted heretically. I told her that whatever is, is not only right, but best. I then began to follow up my doctrine with illustration; and as the devil would have it, I stumbled upon this, “He loved you, madam, when he died:--he might have lived, till he had changed. And you might have gone to your grave then, of a broken heart; he was a sober and temperate, exemplary man---but if he had lived”---the devil! thought I---my consolation has had a most surprising effect! It has stopped her breath!—and tears! It was a styptick only for the bleeding of her heart---- but, I looked up. She made me a profound courtesy, and vanished. She was a lovely woman; and I was rapidly obtaining her best opinion!” “You must have had some fun, in Virginia,” said I. “Yes, I`ll give you an idea of it,” he replied. “I trod upon oaken floors, waxed to a perilous but beautiful smoothness; slept in a bed, where one President, at least, of the United States, had slept before me:---Showed, to an experienced farmer, the reason why he grew poorer and poorer, every year, with eighty slaves upon his plantation; because there were less than ten able bodied men, whose labour could not support the other seventy women and children; old men and sick; I demonstrated to him, that it would be really cheaper to work his lands, with a breed of New England farmers. But let me tell you some of our experiences.” “One day, we met with a most kind hearted old gentleman, to whom we complained bitterly of the villanous tricks, that had been played upon us, by persons, of whom we had enquired the road. The good creature!--he rode three miles out of his way, to put us into a short cut, which he had travelled for thirty years; and he left us, wishing us a pleasant ride. We brushed on.” “You cannot readily form an idea of it; but you may, of us, when I tell you, that, we were five hours, part of it in a tremendous thunder storm beating four miles, with the wind aft; for a whole hour together, not a wheel would touch the ground; and we led our horses, where goats would have felt their heads turn, and their surefootedness in peril Julius Cœsar! what a passion I was in, when night came on! But the next day—on our return, by another road, while we were talking over the trick; and I was wishing to encounter the old man for about ten minutes—we came, all at once, upon him. He was ahead of us—his broad hat, pulled over one eye—his whip, held stifly in his hand, racking away—(a vile, execrable pace, that the finest horses in Virginia are taught) My first disposition was to knock him off his horse, or shoot a bullet through his old hat—head and all—but he turned round, so innocently, that I could not, for my heart, have harmed one of his gray hairs. “I thought, sir, said I, “that you had travelled that cursed road, for thirty years.” “So I have,” he replied, looking surprised. “In a gig!” said I. “A gig!—O, Lord!---O, I beg your pardon---O, gentlemen--No---O!---Oh—no---I always went a foot, or on horseback---Oh, no---in a gig! O, Lord, no!” Poor fellow---we had been so busy; and he, so kind, that he had overlooked our situation---he did not see that were in a gig, with two spirited horses, tandem! nor recollected that he had always travelled it, a foot, or on horseback. “We went into it,[11] [11] It — what? Virginia, I suppose—Ed. with a kind of carriage called a Buggy, horses, harness and equipage, altogether, worth about one thousand, or twelve hundred dollars; and we returned, with about enough of the original BUGGY, to make a snuff box of;—it had been pieced and patched; mended and painted; till it looked more like something put together by chance, than with any preconcerted intention. At one dash, we carried away the top; shattered the whipple tree; snapped one arm off; and dislocated every joint in it. At another, (I was driving, then,) we leaped both horses, at once, in their harness, with the gig at their heels, out of a ferry boat, upon a solid bed of rock. Neither of us had ever driven tandem before; and it was the luckiest thing, in the world, that our bodies did not arrive, at the end of every day's travel, shattered as badly as the gig. I went for amusement; the gentleman with me, upon business. You have been in Virginia. You know something of their sawney way of drawling out their words, like molasses candy; and you know that I am somewhat impetuous.” “Somewhat!” said I. “I believe you. I used to think differently; but you are mightily changed since you were a boy.” “O, my whole nature has altered, since I was a boy; the gibing and taunting, of all the world, have turned the very heart in my bosom to gall. I feel it dissolving at the core, and the mortal poison dripping from it. Yet I do hope---I do, William Adams, fervently, that I shall be able to make them tremble yet, without being a bad man. O, had heaven been pleased to give me shape and beauty, like other men, what might I not have been?” “And would you give up your talent; your inward superiority, Hammond, in exchange for beauty?” “Would I! Ah! I cannot tell. Some times I think, that I would---that it would be better for me, were I a fool, in spirit, with the outward proportions of humanity--- than to be---what! a destestable thing, that men avoid ---and children cry out at---and women---O heaven--- that is hard to bear---that women cannot love.” “Yet you have been loved.” “True, true, I have been; but how! not as I should have been, were I less powerful of spirit, and less horrible of body.” “I doubt it; women that are worth subduing, are not to be won by shape.” “Nonsense, William; shape and beauty have power with all things in heaven and earth. God meant that they should have it. The very beast cowers before them. A beautiful woman might go naked among lions, unhurt; a naked man might pluck the young leopard away from its mother's dugs---were he still the lordly, imperious, undegenerate, noble creature, that God put into paradise!” I pressed his hands. I leaned my forehead against his face. I loved him; and I wept. “And what have I to console me?” he continued--- his melancholy eyes shadowed; and his mouth quivering: “my intellectual superiority? How know I that the veriest fool about me, might not have been greater, had he been spit upon, and trodden upon, as I have been!” “Forgive me, Hammond; O, forgive me,” said I, for my heart smote me, and I remembered where and by whom, he had been spit upon. “From my heart and soul, do I,” said he. “I knew you then, William, even then; and blessed you for the love that I had for---for—.” “For whom!” said I, lifting my head. “No matter,” he answered, quickly---proudly; “no matter---men will deceive themselves. The ugliest will sometimes forget their ugliness; and when they see beautiful eyes change colour---and a beautiful mouth struck pale, at the sound of their voice; when they hear another, in reply, so sweet, that this sound, like the continual ringing of a thin silver pipe, through which water is running swiftly—no earthiness in the colour of the one---nothing mortal in the smooth melody of the other; yet fainting away at their approach-- O, men will deceive themselves! What wonder then that I did! that I, who had locked into angel eyes, till my own shadow seemed beautiful there; till the deep blue of heaven, itself, while I stood rapt and wondering at it; warm with a light so like her own---seemed peopled, like her eyes, only with brilliant and lovely shapes. What wonder that the blue flower; the diluted sapphire; had all a sweet population, just like what I had studied so intently in the blue of her eyes. O, Jehovah! but I did forget thee! myself---the world: --- all but her!----Look where I would, I saw nothing but her halfshut eye lids, and wet mouth opening and trembling. My books were full of her—my drawings—nay, my very flute had caught the tone of her voice; and, for my soul, I could not make it utter any other sound!— What wonder, William Adams, that this delusion and death were fatal to me. What wonder, after I had forgotten myself and all my ambition—that I prayed only for some dark solitary place, where I might lie down, far away from men; and die, with my eyes fixed upon her! I did not pray to wed her—O, I did not think of it. I might have shuddered at the thought; or prayed for barrenness—but oh, my friend! my friend! may you never feel that sorrow; that of all others, which is most deadly, and enervating; that, of having loved tenderly, passionately, devoutly, with the holiest and purest feeling of all your heart—without daring to wish for gratification. I cannot go on---you are affected, distressed—thank you—men should not weep at trifles, William; and such men as you, never—I—I—.” I felt, as if—zounds!—it was just if some one were pouring cold water down my back—at the lamentable sound—a—a—ahem—! “You were speaking of Virginia,” said I, as soon as I could articulate audibly, “let us change the subject.” “Yes, yes,” said he, endeavouring to laugh—“You remind me of a man that I saw on trial once. The clerk read the indictment to him; and he stood mute.” “Guilty or not guilty!” said the clerk. “He was silent.” “Speak sir,” said the Chief Justice—“Answer to the indictment. What do you say? guilty or not guilty?” “Spose we change the subject;”[12] [12] JOE MILLER, 1st. Ed. p. 13, and 14,—Ed. said the man. “You were at Harper's ferry,” I continued. “Is it so very wonderful?” “No---no such mighty matter, I assure you---“the war of the rivers and mountains”---the scene, which was worth crossing the Atlantick to see.” “As Mr. Jefferson says—” —“Is nothing at all. So little is there, of what you expect, that, if you were taken up in your sleep; and set upon the top of the highest hill there, you would think it a very common affair, when you opened your eyes upon it. But, stay; I can give you some notion of the Virginia manner.” “Their hospitality;” said I, eagerly. “No---that has gone out of fashion, now---I saw none of it. I spoke of their travelling manners.” “Why, I thought that they were the most princely, and hospitable people in the world.” “No—just like all others. Among a thin and scattered population; a stranger, of course, is caught, and treated as a prince; but that does not deserve the name of hospitality. It is only a cheap way of purchasing the news; and seeing the world, at second hand. Thus, you will find the hospitality of all civilized people, on the earth, exactly in proportion to the fewness of their visiters; and the unfrequency of their meeting with strangers. A courteous old gentleman from the country, the first half hour after he arrives in the city, will go bare Vol. II. P headed through the street, bowing to every body that he encounters; but, he soon learns, by the people staring at him, that he is in a latitude, where such courtesies are impertinent. Half a century ago, you could not ride by a Virginia plantation, but, at the hazard of being made captive, by the slaves; and feasted and stuffed, man and horse, for a week; but now, you must carry some other recommendation, than your looks; the appearance of a gentleman; or the name of a stranger; to get admittance. I have experienced this; ha!---you are laughing at the idea of any man getting admittance with such looks---even to the den of a wild beast.” “No,” said I, endeavouring to look droll. “Not exactly that.” “The devil! Adams, I understand you---such looks, you think, would be a certain passport there! I should get in, unmolested, undisputed; Hey? should'nt I? Is that what you mean?” said he. “Well, well, Hammond, never mind---it is your fault. You are constantly inviting such allusions; but, go on with your story. What were you to tell me of their travelling manners?” “In the first place, let me give you a notion of their taverns. Except in the considerable towns--- which, by the way, are very inconsiderable; they are the most wretched things upon this continent. All the landlords are gentlemen---the prices, perfectly genteel; and their fair, damned genteel; split chickens, smoked over the coals; and fried bacon, morning, noon, and night. The business of inn-keeping is held to be rather disreputable among them; and, as it is hardly yet the fashion, for a gentleman to stop at a tavern, if he can get his head into a cow house, or a hay rick, they make the few that are driven there by hurricanes; or quartered upon them, by sickness, pay for it shamefully. [13] [13] That is—they make those who da come, pay for those who do not come.—Ed. I could tell you a thousand instances of their extortion, impudence and nastiness; but one will suffice. We had been apprised, for twenty miles beforehand, in a hot day, of the next tavern—“the major's.” Every body talked of the major; he seemed to be a sort of guide post; and quite a rival for the Court House, the place for reckoning latitude and longitude from, in every county of Virginia. At last, we arrived—the house was all open; every window in it. Upon a bench outside, lay a sick negro; turning white, before our eyes, with some horrible disease; in the next room, lay the major, with both feet swathed, sticking out of the window, and drying in the wind; the whole house scented with vinegar and burnt rags. Is this the major's tavern? said I, reining the leader round, gallantly.” “Tavern!” echoed a peaked face booby, six feet high, at the door, thrusting his hands, both together into the waistband of his breeches. “No sir.” But, seeing that I was about to turn away—“we sometimes take in gentlemen.” “O, that is quite enough!” I cried, leaping out— “that is the form, I take it, of your Virginia licence.” “I was overcome with heat, and fever; and went into the house; and laid my head upon the table, sick at the heart and stomach; with the smell of death, like a reeking hospital, all about me. They had nothing to eat, nothing to drink; no oats, nor corn, nor grain, for the horses—and no servant, except an old woman, to untackle them; so that, when I went out—by heaven and earth, there was`nt a piece of the harness, as long as your arm, hanging together—not a buckle, that she had`nt unbuckled; nor a strap, that she had`nt pulled out—for all which, the major charged only two dollars; and left us to harness our horses for ourselves.” “Faith!” said I—“it was like pulling the fellow by the tooth, all round a barber's shop, and only charging sixpence.” “Joe Millar;” he replied. “We were at Harper's ferry, too; at a celebrated tavern, which I would recommend to all the world, when they are so hungry, that they can eat anything, at any price, cooked in any way, without vegetables. I chose to have some lemonade; and we had just set down to the table, when the host entered; and, ducking vehemently, two or three times, informed us that a gentleman wanted to dine with us, if we were “agreeable;” as he was in a hurry.” “Our compliments;” said I; “send him in. We are very agreeable.” “A few moments after, a middle aged man, dressed in black, was shown in; and took his seat, without further ceremony. I was rather amused with his countenance and bearing. He sat bolt upright—and, always dropped his knife and fork, and turned his head about, with a brisk motion, whenever I spoke to him. I took advantage of the propensity; and once or twice, led him into an awkward scrape, by asking him some question, while he had a bone in his mouth. He would let his hands fall, as if they were struck down with a bar of iron, and face me, with the bone between his teeth, unable to articulate a word; till he recollected his situation; when he would lean over the plate, without stirring a finger, and let the bone fall out of his mouth, into it. I kept my countenance, and so did my companion; but he well nigh died of the distress that it caused him, to hide his laughter. However, I soon found that we had a disagreeable, thick headed, vulgar fellow, instead of a gentleman, with us; and I determined to get rid of him, that we might he alone.” “At length, he grew quite intolerable—and reached out his long arm, with a slow movement, in a direction toward my tumbler of lemonade.” “I looked at the arm, for some time, wondering what it was after, and where it came from; and when I saw the true object, provoked at his stupidity, I turned my eyes toward his, with an expression, that arrested him for a moment—he hesitated—his arm was motionless—but still, on the way to the tumbler.” “I'll take some o' that are;” said he. “No you wont;” said I, in the same tone. “He stared at me, for a moment—dropped his hand; and drew himself up, much as if I had been guilty of some violent outrage upon decorum; and my friend, colouring to the eyes, immediately gave him his own glass; into which, the brute stuck his tobacco stained lips, at once, without the slightest ado, as if it had been the table beer, provided for every guest. In such a ease. I would, with pleasure, have ordered him a glass of his own; but I could not---my courtesy is not so complying—suffer a greasy fellow to thrust his nose into my glass; or put his paws into my plate. Some soldiers passed the window, with two or three black musicians. “Them are niggers,” said the Virginian, “makes nice sogers.” “There was a dead silence. I had half a mind to bring on a quarrel; but I could not. All that I could say, would`nt stir his blood. How your eyes flash, William. You would`nt suppose that I impute such forbearance to all the Virginians. O, no—most of them are, as they say of themselves, “chuck full `o fight; fellows of high blood; and damnably true with a pistol bullet. It is their chief accomplishment; and their only chance of notoriety. But, let me finish. I looked my companion in the face. Did you ever see such cold blooded impudence?” said I—“these are your Virginia manners—Damn it, I should as soon think of saying to a man, I'll take your tooth-brush, or your shirt—as I'll take your tumbler. But nothing would do. The man would not quarrel.” “But that is the custom of the country,” said I. “No,” said he; “you are mistaken. A well bred Virginian, is generally, one of the best bred gentlemen to be found. But, the lower order—and nearly all of the Kentuckians---will take the glass out of a stranger's hand, then squirt his tobacco spittle upon his boots, and drink in his face.” “True—but they mean well—they would have you treat them, in the same way.” “Yes, hang them—I remember a case. A fellow wanted to make me drink a half pint of their detestable whiskey, raw, once. I remonstrated. There was a room full. They cursed me for a gentleman—and got round me; and swore that I should do it. I expostulated; pretended sickness: told them how I loathed it— nay, took out my pistols: but, they were not to be intimidated—and—” “You drank it.” “No---I tasted it.” “You did....I would not have believed it.” vol. ii. P 2 “Yes.....but the moment that I did, I dashed the vessel into ten thousand pieces....leaped into the corner, and swore, by the Everlasting God, that I would put a bullet through the first man's heart, that came near me.---The savages! One advanced---I took deliberate aim. Fired....and saw the cloth fly from his jacket.” “By Gaud!” said the fellow....“gee us your hand.... Do you know what I am? Steam-boat!—run agin me, run agin a snag....jam up....got the best jack-knife, prettiest sister, best wife, run faster, jump higher, and whip any man in all Kentuck, by Gaud!” I stood, stock still, wondering what the creature meant. But, he did not suffer me to remain long, in suspense. “Come,” said he, “come out, if you are a man....rough and tumble.” “Gouging?” cried one of the gang. “Look ye!” said I... “scoundrels,” (thankful, nevertheless, that I had not killed the fellow: for, I can bear death, better than the upbraiding of my own heart.... anything---even to the spatter of blood in my face....hot from the heart of a man....lips and nostrils reeking with it.”) I shuddered...“Go on....go on,” said I, faintly. He continued---Hammond, I mean---pardon the confusion of my narrative. “Look you,” said I, “I do not well understand you. You are a large man. I am a small one---yet, you will not find me so feeble as you suppose, if you all set upon me together.” A pause. “What say you; are you for a quarrel?” “They all nodded, and began to rub their hands.” “Well,” said I; “choose any one of your number--- promise me that you will not interfere, any of you, and there is my pistol.”---Saying this, I discharged it; and the ball rattled against the chimney, and came back to my feet.” One of them took it up. “Hell fire, Nat---it was loaded---it's hot now, and blackened with powder,” said he. “Loaded,” said the fellow---that I had shot—“yes, that it was”—running his hand into his bosom, and pulling it out, all bloody---“see there!---loaded---yes--- and we must ha' it out.” I looked at him, for a moment. “Then you, and I are to take the tossle?” “Yes, yes—ready!---ready! all ready.” “There was a general outery at this—and all present set up a shout; and flourished their hands and feet.” “No—not yet—wait a moment. I heardyou speak of gouging—are we to gouge?” “Aye, gouge! and bite!—pull hair! and scratch!”— they yelled all together. “And strangle too? I suppose,” said I, as unconcernedly, as I could;---for I thought, if any thing would intimidate them, it would be such self confidence, and coolness, in a creature, so diminutive as I.” “As I said this, I tore off my neckcloth, with a jerk: the collar, and bosom of my shirt followed.—My breast—you have never seen it---it is frightful; all covered with a coarse, black, shaggy hair—and the muscles, in their agitation among it, look like a living net work; like exasperated, trodden serpents; rattle snakes coiling, and writhing.—I had seen more than one stout heart quake, when I stood naked, from my waist up, before him; and even this fellow drew back, for a moment, when I stripped—as from the clutches of a bear.” “Come on,” said I—stretching out my arms. “He shut his eyes, and leaped at me. I sprang aside; and he struck the wall, so that it stunned him. He fell; and I waited for his first stirring, to level him again. I could do it, William Adams—that man never lived, I do believe, whom I could not bring down, like a dead man—with a fair blow of my naked fist--- nay—I have felled a horse with it. He arose, and I gave him two—one at the mark—(the pit of the stomach, you know,) and one that made his nostrils gush out like crushed blood vessels. He staggered against the wall; and stood there, heaving, and retching, for a minute; with the whiskey, and blood running together, out of his mouth:—but, the next moment, by heaven! I would not have believed, that mortal man had such strength; I was under him, helpless as a babe, stunned; and as I thought, suffocating; when, suddenly, I felt his great, strong hand, wreathed into my hair; and the thumb approaching the socket of my right eye; and digging about my temple. I remembered, what I had heard; that was gouging. The thought was madness; death. God gave me sudden strength. I grappled at his throat, just as you saw me the other day; and I never let it go, though several struck at me, and pulled at my arms---(they were black and blue the next day) till his swollen tongue lolled out of his mouth---and the breath rattled in his throat. He rolled from me, blind, and senseless; deathstruck; and the savages danced round me. I had conquered their champion; and they were ready to worship me.” “This was in Kentucky,” said I---“I have heard of such things.” “Yes---the fashion is gone by, in Virginia.” “You are distressed?” “Yes.” “Disturbed?” “No.” “You have great command of countenance?” “Yes.—Wonderful.” “But not of your hands,” said I, glancing at them; for, while his face was immoveable as death—vibrating a little, only in the surface, like some coagulated fluid; or like molten iron—his fingers, and hands, and feet, were all convulsed---and shaking.” “Right,” said he, (holding up his hands)—“right! at this moment; they feel as if they were wrestling yet, with the fellow! I have no command over them, at times—iron cannot deaden them—blades cannot sever them, when they are sprung; and though my arm were broken to dust; and they severed at the wrist, I do believe, that they would fulfil their office; and cling to the throat that they had griped; instinct with vengeance, and wrath, like living things. Their hold was never yet broken—(and I have had their bones broken) after they were once sprung—but it was too late then, too late—their prey was throttled; and no mortal help could release it!” “But I thought you patient—very patient.” “I am, under insult, reproach, derision; but not where wild beasts are upon me; or woman hath need of me.” “Woman!” said I, “what woman was in that affair at the prison? that, at the court house? that, on the— “The duel! you mean.” He grew calm, all at once. “Let me tell you,” said he, “how that was.” “Not now.” “Yes now; now or never.” “Well then, never!” said I, unwilling to see him go mad before my face. “William Adams, I can read your heart; you have nothing to fear. You know nothing of my self command. I can sit and talk to you, calmly, with my heart on fire; with serpents breeding in my brain. Take hold of my wrist---put your hand upon my pulse--- look me in the face; (I obeyed him)---now, hear me--- but beware how the joint springs; I have no command over them; and you were in less danger, to be caught by the hand of a strong man drowning; or under amputation, than by mine, when I tell the story.” “I had been challenged more than once; but I had generally laughed it off; and I never found any body fonder of fighting than myself, when the truth was known; but this man, he whom I shot---softly---softly ---let me begin with the first affair.” “First then, stay, there is one pleasant affair, that occurred to me in Virginia, which I must tell you. We had risen at day light---nay, sometime before, meaning to make a great day s work--but took a wrong road; and discovered it, just when we were, man and horse fainting with fatigue and hunger. After much toil, we came to a house, lined all about with the devilish things, called embroidery and painting, done by creatures that have been brought up at a boarding school; this, of course, did not much help my appetite, or temper; and, after getting the whole house about my ears there; we set off again, and arrived---O! with my blood all on fire---at a tavern, kept by another gentleman. I could neither eat nor speak; the fever and ague were upon me; and all that I wanted upon this earth, was a bed to die upon. Do you think the infernal rascals did not put me into a garret; the wall six feet thick, at the least inch; and whitewashed inside and out, as if they meant to bake me alive; two windows only in it, exactly east and west, so that the sun was in it all day long, (if not all night) with a bed hot enough to roast, any thing but bed bugs, and they were gasping for breath. And when I had got fairly into a—dose? no, into a rare done state; do you think the sons of bitches didn't send up a negro wench to wake me, with a plate full of green pears! pears that you could not bore into, with a gimlet! It is true, by heaven.” “But, let us have the duel,” said I, laughing; “or that, which you say led to it.” “Well then, to begin at the beginning.” “First, there was a scoundrel here, who pulled out a pistol, and snapped it in my face. I beat him for it; and he insisted on satisfaction; and, when I met him, I had no idea of fighting. I meant to get an apology if I could, if not, to make one. He had'nt the strength to level the pistol.” “But the affair of the court house,” said I. “O, there was another scoundrel,” he replied, “arraigned in court for counterfeiting---I was all on fire to join in the prosecution; but my better feeling prevented me. I knew that I hated the wretch so bitterly, that, if I opened my mouth against him, the jurors would probably acquit him, from a mere principle of humanity. When the trial was through, the Judge called him up to reprimand him for having suborned a witness, a fact that nobody could doubt, who heard the trial.” “I have been injured,” said the rascal, misrepresented, your honour.—I am an honest man, your honour, an honourable man—a man of family.” (A blunder that he always made—he did not, and could not, understand the difference between a man with a family, and a man of family.) “There are fifty men in court, that know me—call any of them, your honour—any, I do'nt care whom.” The Judge was standing upon the step—the scoundrel below him; and I, just at his back, unseen, unheard; but my patience could hold out no longer. I knew that he was one of the most wretched swindlers that ever lived; and I tapped him gently on the shoulder—“call on me! I am ready—call on me, I know you,” said I. He looked round, and turned pale as death, when he saw me; but willing to brave it out; “that is the man,” said he, “Albert Hammond; he is the man that has gone about telling—.” “I was afraid that he might say some word, which would make it necessary for me to knock him down, upon the spot. And, lest he should, I just put my face close to his. I could not speak; but my lips moved, and he saw my eyes.” “He stopped short, gasping for wind, as if he were ready to give up the ghost; and, the next moment was dragged out of court, by his own counsel.” “There was a silence then, for some minutes, as if a murder had been committed. The judge took his seat, utterly amazed and confounded.” “What is the matter,” said one of the bar, to me, in a whisper, across the trial table.” “Nothing!” said I—nothing—and then I proclaimed in a loud firm voice, that William R. Smiley, (that was the man's name) was the most damnable scoundrel that walked this earth!” I then turned, leisurely round; and walked out of court: expecting every moment, in the awful stillness that followed, to hear the judge say---“Officer! take that man into custody.” But he forbore---God bless him for it! he forbore; and, as soon I had leisure to think of the outrage that I had offered to the temple of justice; and to a respectable magistrate, I sat down, under the remonstrance of a friend, and wrote a letter of apology, to him.” “How was it received?” “Well, I dare say---I heard nothing of the affair afterward; except that Smiley had publickly threatened to whip me; and I was warned to take care of knives and pistols.” “Were you not afraid?” “No, not in the least. When men mean to do such things, they do not threaten; and I knew that he dared no more face me, nay, with Peter Raymond, Charles Gordon, and Samuel Saubiere, and half a dozen other just such cowardly, sneaking rascals at his back, than he would a starved lion. I had been often threatened; and never without feeling much more secure than they, when I looked at them and said nothing. Once, there was a great six foot fellow came to my office, late in the evening, with the avowed intention to flog me. (I did not know of it, till afterward.) That he might be the better able to do it he had filled himself, up to the eyes, with whiskey; in which state he was, as I afterward found, one of the most brutal, blood thirsty fellows, that ever lived. He had maltreated his wife—abused her; beaten her; the mother of many children; and, literally, kicked her out of his doors, and I had undertaken to make him furnish her with a support. Once, and with great difficulty, I had reconciled them; but this was the second time.” “As soon as I opened the door, I saw in his eyes, what would have made almost any man tremble—the purpose of a murderer. Yet, I pointed him, calmly, to a chair; sat down to my writing; and pretended to wait for him to speak.” “He had come on an errand of death; but he dared not break the silence; he dared not open his lips. If I could keep this awe upon him; I knew that he would have no opportunity to work himself into a passion. Three or four times, he looked up, as if about to throw himself upon me, at once; but, my apparent unconcern, and perhaps helplessness; or sense of security disconcerted, and, probably, intimidated him. It was not what he had expected; and had prepared himself for. He had all the business of screwing up his courage, to do over again; and so, like every man in such a case, was disconcerted and frightened. I arose, at last; opened the door, and pointed him out. He obeyed me; by heaven he did! and it was not till I heard his step upon the pavement—stopping—and I had bolted the door, that I was fully sensible of the escape, that I had made. The sweat started from my forehead, when I came to think of it. I was all alone; with no living creature; and no arms near me, then—but it was the last night that I was unarmed—the very next day, I was prepared for him, or anybody. He never knew how he got out of my office, and never will; and, I am sure, from his stopping, and coming nearly back, to the door, again, which he found shut against him, that he had not entirely given up his purpose, till he saw that he could not perform it. The next day, his wife came to see me, half frightened out of her wits; but, when she saw me, and heard me speak; and found that I was not only a living, but a well man, she could hardly believe her senses. I was the first, probably, that ever escaped him, when he was drunk, and in wrath,” “How like me!” I exclaimed—“upon my word, Hammond, you are infinitely less of a hero, than I thought you!” “Thank you,” said he, smiling—“you are very candid; I do not pretend to be a hero. I hope never to be one. But, I do believe, that the time will come, when I can bear to be buffetted, and spit upon, patiently. Nay, I could bear it now—I am sure—” “If all mankind could look into my heart, and see the true motive of my forbearance---if they could see that it was not fear, but courage; not meanness; the spirit of a dastard, but magnanimity.” “You knew a young man of our neighbourhood, named Lewis?” “Yes.” “I have been nearer having a case of life and death with him, deliberately, than with any other human being---I thought of it for several days. He had taken advantage of a weak and sickly young fellow, whom I had known; and beaten him shamefully, once, with a cowhide.---A friend told me of it. I made up my mind, upon the spot---to beat him, blind, at any rate; and, if he should be peevish, or troublesome, to beat him to death. I went to his house, while the vol. ii. Q thought was upon me; but heaven prevented me--I was a stranger; and, by accident, he happened not to return till later than usual that night, not, indeed, until I, as a stranger, had left the house. Before we met, my disposition nearly changed; and he escaped. Yes! Adams; there, I was like you. Had I met that fellow, I should have slain him, I have no doubt; for he was strong, perhaps as strong as I; and I should not have endured any resistance.—When I think of that, I tremble. It was too black, and deliberate, for any man in his right senses to undertake---may heaven pardon me for it! It was a deep and dreadful meditation. Many a poor fellow has been hung for less guilt.” “Had you not some unpleasant affair once, about a murderer?” “A murderer!—no—O, I remember!—yes, yes. No, it was'nt any matter of seriousness. A man had been taken up on suspicion of murder; and the people, about him, were putting questions to him, on all sides. I went to the miserable creature, and told him not to answer them—to answer nobody; or nobody but the judges, who were about to examine him.” “Am I obliged to answer them?” said he, piteously. “No—I replied. “A man who saw me in conversation, with the prisoner, and was afraid to speak to me, himself, spoke to another; and he, to another; till, at last, it came to the ears of the judge.” “He spoke to me—called me up before him—put on all his terrours—(how little he knew me!)—there was a dead silence.” “You have been talking with the prisoner?” said he, sternly. “I have,” said I, rivetting my eyes upon his, to show him what he was about to encounter.” “And—and—and what did you say to him?” he continued more complaisantly. I repeated it:—adding: “I did my duty, sir—no more nor less; and I know what my duty is”—(and his too, I might have added, as well as he did—and better than he did it.”) “O, sir,” he replied, graciously, “you were perfectly right—perfectly!” “Yes, sir.—So I was. I knew it as well as he did; and, while I was yet smarting under a sense of the meditated indignity, that had been offered me—one of the officers of the court, put his hand upon me, and pushed me.” “I glanced at him—his hand fell, as if it had been struck with a bullet.” “Stand back,” said he—fiercely, “stand back!” “Not an inch,” said I—“and hark ye—don't put your hand upon me, again—if you do—” “Why!” said he, “what would you do?” “Do!”—I answered, breathing in his face—“pitch your carcase down that stair case—that's what I'll do! —try me.” “I'm an officer of the court,” said he, shrinking back, somewhat appalled.” `The court!—lay your hand on me again; and I'll pitch you to hell; and the court after you.” “He smiled—and I believe, began to feel his courage coming back; but he did not know me. I touched him, and pointed to the yard below.” “No,” said he—“I cannot leave the court.” “I could not wait all day, for an opportunity to whip him; and I came off; but two or three days after, I encountered him in the street. I went up to him directly; but, the moment that he saw me, he turned pale; shook, from head to foot, and made me, just the apology that I desired. I knew not what I should have done with him, else—” “Were you able to beat him?” “Beat him!—yes, to death, before he could utter a cry—but I would, rather have been beaten to death myself.” “Is it possible?” “Possible!” he exclaimed; “you do not know me—I am all over bone—I can plunge my arm, up to the elbow, into the side of any man that ever breathed.— I—” “But the duel—Hammond—I am weary of holding your pulse.” “I am coming to it,” he added, haughtily. “Let go my wrist, then; I cannot do it at once. I have kept it off as long as possible. It cost me some preparation; and as I never yet told it to a human being; and it is only known, lately, to the relations of the poor fellow— (his voice faltered—and he turned away his head)— I—I—let me begin with the first affair—I was shockingly insulted; but I bore it—till I was no longer master of myself. We fired across a table; and I found then that neither of our pistols were loaded:—the powder singed my face—we were so near. That was the first. I was young then; but the story got wind, and I was put upon, the more for it. At last, after two or three trifling matters, I had one, that had well nigh been serious. I was in a little country town. A beautiful girl, who had once been very dear to me, sat working by my side. A noble hearted fellow stood near me; and, after some pleasantries, wrote upon a piece of paper, with a lead pencil: “I promise to pay A. L. (the girl in question,) one kiss, value received.” She took it, and laughed—saying, “what shall I do with it?” “O, it's negotiable,” said I—“endorse it over.” “Endorse it! how?”—she asked, eagerly, her blue eyes winking with pleasure.” “Give it to me,” said I---and I wrote upon the back, “pay to Sally (somebody)---about whom the poor fellow was especially sore, though I knew it not---I had only heard her name---Sally was a black girl.” His dark eyes flashed fire:—his lips turned to the colour of white ashes, and trembled. “Do you know,” said he, “that that is an insult?” “I did not,” said I---turning immediately to the girl, and begging her not to imagine any such thing.” He was still in wrath,---but turned haughtily, and said, “very well, sir,” and left the room. As soon as he had gone, the lady of the house told me why he had been hurt. I was very sorry, for he had generous blood in him; and I would not, for my right hand, have wounded such a nature. But what could I do? I had said all, that a gentleman could say: ---true, but not all that a man could say. So, I followed him to his room; told him the whole; and gave him my hand. His eyes filled. He shook through all his frame---we were friends from that moment.” “Of course!” said I, “of course!” “The next day, he carried my answer to a note, from another quarter!” “How was that?” “Why,---I was hard pushed in company, one evening, and proposed, merely for talk's sake, that we should ship off a load of New England girls, with pattern cards, for the southern market.” “I had previously been pretty free with the southern character, freer, it may be, than I should have been, had I not supposed that all in the room were from the northern and middle states. But a young man, whom I had all along supposed to be a Bostonian, at least, asked me, with something like a sneer---for what purpose I should ship women to the south? I did not like his manner, and answered with more bitterness than I intended— “To marry gentlemen---if they could be found.”— Soon after, the company separated; and, after I returned to my lodgings, I heard, to my astonishment, that the young man, to whom I had addressed the remark, was from the south.” “Then,” said I, “if he have blood in him, I shall get a note during the day, to-morrow. I said this, because I knew the Virginia character, prompt for quarrel or reconciliation; frolick or death—lion-hearted fellows---with bosoms like a powder magazine---and excellent targets.” “I was not disappointed. The note came, with all due ceremony, asking two or three civil questions, which I, as civilly, replied to---maintaining, however, stoutly, all that I had said of the southerners;---but honestly confessing, that I had no especial allusion to him, in my remark; for the true reason, that I took him for a yankee. Not that, had I known him; and he had said what he did say, I might not have been quite as bitter; but—I should have been more careful, of course, how vol. ii. Q 2 I sported with the feeling of a stranger, among a people, who were naturally jealous of southern strangers, and, by whom, they were held in a sort of thraldom; like proscription and antipathy. What I said, was perfectly satisfactory. He was glad enough to receive it, I dare say; and I cannot deny, that I was very glad that he did receive it. I was kept in suspense, however, for about an hour, by the gentleman that bore my answer: the very man who was about cutting my throat the day before;—but, in that time, I had made up my mind exactly how to behave—to receive the challenge —accept it—fight him with broad sword,” and— “Ah!” said I—“are you a good blade?” “Very,” was the reply—“are you?” “Broad sword, tolerable—cut and thrust tolerable— small sword, very good.” “Well, how did it end?” “Oh, just as I tell you—without blood-shed; but hardly was I well out of that, when I came near cutting another fellow into mince-meat—or of being cut into mince-meat, by him.” “There was to be a ball at the house where I was; and a young Hotspur from the south, a dwarf too, not taller than I, but prettily put together; and much younger, had promised, if timely notice were given him, to run away from college, or feign sickness, for a day or two, and take a hand in it.” “I had been employed, all the forenoon, in writing notes of invitation; and, at the last, wrote one to him. “He has read your book”—said one of the girls—“was delighted with it;—and so, I would have you treat him as an old acquaintance.” I yielded, and wrote him a pleasant, familiar sort of a note, just such an one, I know, as would have brought me from the furthest end of the earth;—then there was a little dispute about how his name was to be spelt; and, therefore, I wrote it half a dozen different ways, punning with it, at every step. To add to all this—when I bid her look into the almanack, and see what day of the month, the next Thursday was—(the day fixed for the ball) so that there would be no mistake—she looked in, at the wrong month; and, when I said Thursday, the fifteenth, instead of appearing, what I meant it should be, a particular invitation, it looked confoundedly like a hoax; for, he would find that Thursday was the seventeenth.— And, finally, before it went out of my hands, some boy in the family, wrote under my name, “author of so, and so.” “The stage coach came in, on the appointed day; but, instead of the gentleman, it brought me an impertinent letter, which, alter asking how old, and how large the writer was, I crushed with my hand, and threw into the fire; saying, as I did so, that, if I met the boy, I should box his ears for it;—that I should pass through the town where he was, on a certain day,—but should not go out of my way, to meet him.” “In five minutes, I had forgotten the affair. The letter was a childish thing; but saucy and affected;— and so ill a return for my politeness, that, I really pitied the fellow. On the day appointed, I arrived at the regular hour in the town where he lived; waited some time, and was rather in the hope of escaping, without a scuffle; for which purpose, I had actually thrown myself upon the bed, to wait for the next steam boat. But growing tired of the suspense; and, half ashamed of my own timidity, I went below. There, I found a black fellow waiting for me, with a note. I read it. It was rather insulting, but boyish—and, by such a messenger, of course, I was not bound to take any notice of it—according to the laws of honour!” “Where is this man to be found?” said I. “I will show you,” was the reply. “Is he alone?”— “No, sir—Mr. — is with him.” “Go on.” said I, putting my cane under my arm, “lead me to the place.” “The etiquette of duelling, you know, I suppose, left me several chances of escape. In the first place, the note was brought, as I have said, by a black fellow;—of course, I was not bound to answer it;—in the next place, I was alone; and had no friend in the city to call upon; and, thirdly, my antagonist was a boy in age, and strength, compared with myself. But, on the road, I made up my mind to act with great patience, and deliberation; and then, if I could get any decent excuse for it, to beat the principal and second black and blue, till they challenged me, when I should have the choice of weapons, and could hack them both at my leisure, with a broad sword; or run them through, with a small sword.” “The black fellow led the way, through a long, dark, narrow street; and then, into a house; up a dim stair case; at the top of which, a door stood open, with lights burning upon the table; several glasses partly filled; and cigars yet smoking, as if a number of people (whose voices I heard in the room above) had just left the table, as I came in.” “I had scarcely passed through this room, and asked for the writer of the note, when a tall, handsome looking young man appeared, saying that he was the friend of the party; and that, any communication which I might have to make, was to be made to him.” “I was very serious. I threw off my surtout, and laid my cane upon the table, looking at the door, at the same time, the better to prepare myself for what I was determined on; to give both of the young gentlemen a handsome beating, at the peril of my life, though they were backed by the whole college; and, that I could have done it, I have no doubt---doubt! No---I could have whipped the whole college, one after the other, I dare say.” “The second appeared a good deal struck at my appearance. He had expected to see a much younger man, I am sure; and a countenance, probably, much less determined.” “We had some conversation about the last note.” “Your friend is a boy,” said I—“what excuse can I offer to society, for cutting the throat of a boy?” “O, if that be all,” said he, composedly, “I am ready to step into his shoes!” “I smiled; and who would not, at such youthful gallantry. It made my heart feel warm, and beat high, to look upon him. I had determined to provoke him; —but I could not—he behaved with such perfect propriety. We then began to examine the matter; and found that the whole had been a misapprehension;—and the result was, that the principal was called in, a fine, spirited looking young fellow;—and we shook hands together; drank a glass of wine; and parted, the best friends in the world!” “Infinitely better than fighting!” said I—. —“But”—said he—“William—I—I—” I looked up. His countenance fell; and his nether lip worked; and red streaks of passion shot over his frightfully bald forehead.</field>

O, heaven and earth! as if there could be no forgiveness, for what he was about to relate. His temples were swollen—he was black in the face—and his features were like those of a dead man—immoveable—while the bones of his hand kept rattling, with an incessant motion, upon the table—“we have come now, to the duel.” “They had all toasted their women,” said Hammond, abruptly, locking his hands, with a convulsive effort: “all!—and then, he—he—he uttered the name of Elizabeth.” “The name thrilled through and through me,” said Hammond. “They all drank it, standing. “Elizabeth! Elizabeth!” echoed through the whole room. I covered my ears, with a feeling of profanation. But that was nothing—nothing! Elizabeth who? cried one —aye, cried another—let us have it.” “Elizabeth Adams—” answered the madman, in a loud voice, throwing off another bumper, which was followed by the whole company. Your blood boils. I see, William Adams, to hear me tell it; judge then what I felt, to hear her blessed name uttered by such a man, in such a company; associated with the lewd and blaspheming. I stood thunderstruck, for a moment; and then tried, two or three times, to get my breath; to gasp; to cry out; to speak to him; but, I could not. I could not see plainly; I could not utter a sound. The company began to take notice of it; and all the noise, and laugh, and song, and riot instantly died away, into a stillness, more awful than death; while every eye was turned upon me.” “I was leaning toward him—and I whispered, very faintly, so faintly, that I did not hear my own voice— but, it came from the deepest place of all my heart— and he understood the motion of my lips—he heard me!” “Elizabeth Adams, of D—?” said I. “Yes!” he haughtily replied: “Elizabeth Ad—.” “You are a scoundrel!” said I, jumping up—I would not let him finish it—dwelling on every syllable; “you are a scoundrel, and a villain!” A glass decanter whizzed by my head, as I spoke; and narrowly missed dashing my brains out. We both rushed at each other; and he grasped a carving knife; but it was wrenched from him; and we were separated, till the room was cleared; a circle formed; and swords put into our hands but mine was a miserable cut and thrust; and, in receiving one of his blows, before I could make a pass, it was shattered to the hilt. We closed; and I was very severely cut in the hand. No other sword could be obtained; and we stood, leaning against the wall; panting, like spent tigers—till the company had agreed to escort us to a wood, just out of the town; and leave us to our fate, with pistols. Some objected to this; but at last, the business was arranged; how, I know not; and the next thing, that I recollect is, that, we were together—his friend with us—that it was just day light, and that I had just levelled and fired at his heart; and that, I saw the ball strike him—but he stood still.” “You are wounded;” said his second, approaching me. “No,” said I, “I am not—but your friend is—look to him.” When I said this, he fell. It was wonderful how I escaped. He was a great shot. But, when we levelled, there was a strange darkness about me, for a moment; and I felt as if, already, a ball had passed through me—coldness and numbness:—but I caught his eye just then, and observed that, as I dropped my pistol, his eye followed it, till it was just opposite his breast. I fired—before he had recovered himself; and the result was, what I have told you.” Thus ended the tale of Hammond; but the tones of his voice! O, no language can describe them. They went through and through me. I felt myself constrained to give him my hand, and to press him, in silence, to my heart. I did—and I felt his flesh quiver at the touch; and contract, as if mine had been the hand of a spectre. “Look here, William Adams,” said he, lifting his black matted locks; “look here!—it was'nt grief that did it—no, nor old age. But his hand! Three thousand miles were we apart. Yet, at the moment; the very moment when he died---the very moment! these locks turned white! I felt his hot hand there, in my sleep. I awoke, with a scream, that startled the household, broad awake. It was midnight---but not a soul could sleep again that night. You may smile, William, but no---you do not---you look serious. Are you really so? Speak to me. Can you believe me?” “I do.” “It is impossible. You cannot. You believe that I am disordered. What! that, at the moment of his death —the very moment! he should appear to me; and put his hand upon my temples; and awake me from my sleep. O, you cannot!—unless:—William, have you had any experience in such things?” “No.” “I cannot believe you. Nothing else would make you credit me.” “Then,” said I, “I will tell you the truth. Two things have happened to me, during my life; two, of which I never think, without feeling my blood run cold —yet, I cannot believe them.” “What were they? Not believe them! Not believe your own senses! How know you that you are talking to me?” “I'll tell you what they were. I once saw a child's face, without any body to it, as plainly as I now see yours; pressed against the outside of a glass window, thirty feet from the ground; no body—no support to it; nothing but the face. Ha! what ails you, Hammond?” “By my life! I have seen the same thing! but, I never mentioned it in my life! It was in your father's house, at the head of the high stair case—was it not?” I stopped chilled to the very heart. I laid my hand upon his arm; but, it was too late. There was no disputing with him; and that strange, icy thrill went through all our arteries, at the same moment; and our eyes filled, and our lips trembled, with horrour and eagerness—what a strange feeling it is! “And again,” said I. “I saw a cradle, standing in a floor—no human being near it—no wind, no jarring, to disturb it—no living creature near it—begin to rock, with a slow, regular motion, and continue, till I stopped it, pale and breathless, with my own hand. A woman saw it, who at the same moment, fainted. The child was sick, and lay across her lap.” “And died;” said Hammond. “No, it recovered. But, had it died, we should have regarded it as ominous.” “What caused it to rock?” “I know not—I never could find out. I have no doubt that the cause was a natural one;—but, so help me heaven, I would give one of my fingers at this moment—nay, almost my right hand, to discover what that cause was, to be satisfied about it.” “Let us change the subject; it is getting dark;” said Hammond, peevishly. “And I cannot well bear to talk of such matters, when my own shadow, upon the wall, frightens me.” I was struck with his manner. It was really solemn, white there was an apparent carelessness in it. “It cannot surely be,” said I, to myself, “that this man is given to such superstition;” but still, his manner betokened it too strongly, for me to permit myself, at that time, to investigate the truth. “On the whole, then,” I added, in a cheerful tone, “how were you pleased with Virginia? Let us return to that, if you please.” “Agreed—mightily. You have heard of strolling players. There were a set at Harper's Ferry, while I was there. The bill announced Octavian, and Rais vol. ii. R ing the Wind; and, in the evening, I sought out the theatre. It was the upper part of a barn; a sort of cock loft, with only one window to it, (a hole sawed in the boards) and paper hanging, for scenery; but, the dresses were from some larger theatre. I was delighted—I had seen Octavian as badly acted by the best of tragedians; and, had he not, in two or three mad scenes, when he tore his wig—thrown the hair into our faces; (but such was our nearness to him, that he could not well avoid that) — had there been fewer fowls at roost over me; and fewer country criticks beside me, I should have done very well. But the farce! O, it was inimitable. They called it Raising the Wind; and it really deserved the name. Every one recollected what he could of his part, (without any copy in the company, I am sure,) and put it in, without giving or taking any cue, whenever he could.—There was no plot—no dialogue, as it was played—but a series of repetition; whatever took, was sure to be repeated; and Jeremy Diddler ate, at least, (and who would have wondered at it, if an opportunity offered) a dozen of eggs, with the shells on—shells, and all—sound or rotten, and half a peck of bread; merely that the audience, who relished that joke exceedingly. might see him snatch it out of the London booby's mouth. I laughed, till the tears ran out of my eyes. I had never seen a piece played, when every man appeared so easy in his part—so free from stage fright. This served me for a week, at least; and, every time that I thought of it, during that week, I would throw myself back in the buggy; give up the reins; and roar, till my sides ached. But after that, I had recourse to another expedient. We had mended and patched our gig so often, at a particular place, every morning; and I had gone so regularly to breakfast, at the tavern, opposite to the place where the mender lived, to wait for it, that I found it a subject of regular calculation, an item for every day's expenses—“ mending gig,”—so much. Arrive when I would, I never could take them by surprise—I was always expected—the table was set---the blacksmith ready —the painter—and a boy up the road, to announce my coming. You would have laughed. We would get it repaired, in the morning; break it again the same day; and, returning in the evening, limp through bye paths, till our course could be traced by the havock, that we made among the small hickory trees, that we had hewed down and lashed, every mile or two, to the arms of the gig, to make it hold together, till we could have it repaired again. Indeed, I had well nigh contracted for my board at the tavern, by the week; notwithstanding the bed bugs, and musquitoes, and a creature that the landlord called a bar, which I found to be a bear.” “Pray,” said I, “speaking of theatricals—It appears to me, that I once heard a story about you. I do not rightly remember what, but—were you not once upon some stage?—or—.” “Yes—for a single night.” “And how did you succeed?” “Wonderfully. The people laughed themselves blind.” “Tragedy, I suppose,” said I. “Certainly,” he replied. “I never pretended to make people laugh, with any thing else. O, I was very fine—very!—” “But what put it into your head?” “I'll tell you. I lived for a time, once, in a small town, where an awkward little lawyer, who had a strange notion that he was of a tragedy turn, because he had been permitted to blunder through the part of young Norval, at a country exhibition;—proposed to get up a “corpse” of amateurs. The thing was pleasantly arranged. We took a large dancing hall; chalked off the pit, boxes, stage, and orchestra; sent to Boston, for some of their tattered scenery;—chose Douglas; and, as an especial compliment to me, who had never seen a play performed in all my life, at that time, gave me Glenalvon. You will smile at my conception of it. I had never seen a play; but I did not like to own it, particularly, as I had been very loud and positive, for a long time, in canvassing the merits of sundry distinguished actors, of whom, I had heard, through the publick papers—and I had no idea at all of a soliloquy. I should have made a beautiful Hotspur; and, perhaps might, in time, have barked through the character of Richard, or Caliban, without the trouble of dressing for the parts. Never shall I forget our first recitation. “Burning hell!” said I, “this were thy centre, if I thought she loved him!”—whereat, I took a sort of straddling leap, and such an attitude! O, it would have done your heart good, to see me. You would have thought that I had just been thrown overboard in my sleep. But that was pronounced “very fine! very”—only, as the exhibition was not intended for the whole town, gratis, it was delicately hinted to me that a little less powder—a very little—would be quite as natural. But, in the soliloquy, where I had to say “By and by, I'll woo her, as the lion woos his bride.” O, I was irresistible! Not a creature could keep his countenance. But alas, alas! the envy and uncharitableness, of men! I was utterly supplanted by a man, who had a knack of snapping his eyes, and making faces, like George Frederick Cooke;—and, after some shuffling; dragging; and one rehearsal, where three different Glenalvons stumbled through the part, with the book in their hands—the affair fell through.” “But, I was not satisfied; and, not long after, I waited upon the manager of a regular theatre, and offered my services for one night. They set me to ambling, before them, as if to try my paces; and, at last, gave me, would you believe it! the character of Zanga. Never shall I forget my reception. At first, the audience were mute, as if death struck. It is no exaggeration---I say it, seriously. I never saw any thing like it, for breathlessness and awe. But it lasted only for a moment.---At the first sound of my voice---what I was told the next day, was not my own voice---nor any thing like it---but a gasping, inaudible sound, like the smothered cry of a wild beast—there was a sort of sick shuddering through all my frame; and a suppressed exclamation, through all the audience; and a loud, impatient, universal breathing, made up, I thought, of derision, pity, amazement, contempt, and compassion. God! I thought that I should sink into the earth. My heart was in my throat---my knees yielded, and trembled under me---a dark confusion fell upon me--a million of dizzy lights, and eyes—glittered and danced about, and about me; and there was a confused murmur coming up from below me, as if I were upon the sea shore:--and a ringing in my ears, and a tingling in my blood—a blindness and giddiness—such as I believe, no other human creature, would ever have lived through. I had heard of the stage fright; and sea sickness; and death, from poison—convulsion—drowning—of faintness---and downright suffocation—but I never heard of any body, who had survived all of them together---yet I did. But, just when I was about to give up the ghost, the murmur of compassion died away---and I heard one distinct and audible hiss. Lord, how it went through me! It electrified me. They say, that my hair stood upright---and that (I was not painted) my face grew frightfully black; and I know that I felt my blood ripple and hiss---I'll swear to that---my anger arose, like fire in a high wind. I forgot my terrour, in the indignity; my own ugliness, and the grave encouragement, that I had received at the last rehearsal, to persevere; for that, in all probability, if I did, in three or four years, I should be sufficiently advanced to carry messages. Yes, I forgot it all—fools!—and in less than twenty minutes, the house was all, once more, still as death. I left out a whole scene, but they did not perceive it; and went on without any interruption—any outcry—until I heard the voice of people sobbing.—I turned—I looked—my heart heaved—my own eyes filled—I could have knelt down upon the spot, and shouted to my God. I had prevailed! I had made them weep that had hissed and hooted at me. What more could I desire. Nothing. I left the stage—even where I stood—shaking off the dust from my feet, in testimony against them all. Since then, I have never set my foot upon any boards.” “Yet you speak, even now, as if there had been a passion, and deep feeling, in your nature, for it,” said I. “You are right. There have been,” was the reply. “The stage wants reformation. I could have reformed it.” vol. ii. R 2 I smiled, and laid my hand upon his arm, kindly; but with a look of gentle upbraiding, that I wished him to feel; yet—he would not feel it—he could not. “I understand you, my friend;” he answered, “you are distressed at my vanity; are you not?” “I am.” “Yet, what do you call vanity?” I began to define it; but, he interrupted me, with great earnestness, and authority. “No sir—they, who charge me with vanity, had better hold their tongues, or speak more plainly; and say that I have too good an opinion of myself. Then, we should be at issue. And time, the trier of all things, would, one day, or other, determine whose judgment was the truest—theirs or mine. I tell you, that they do not think well enough of me.” “William Adams,” he continued, rising proudly, with his haughty lip quivering like that of some young sovereign, about to lift a flood gate to his army and lay waste a province. “William Adams! I despise, more heartily than any man that ever lived, the love of notoriety. I venerate, as truly; and am as steadfast an idolator, as ever breathed, of dominion, and power; of genuine ambition. I love praise, but not the praise of ordinary men; and, best of all, do I love the praise of my own heart. I love the good opinion of good, and wise men; but, most of all, do I love my own good opinion. Their reproach, I can bear—their upbraiding. I can bear; but I cannot bear the upbraiding of my own heart; the sorrow and shame—the burning shame of my own lacerated spirit, under its own heavy dealing. And---look at me, sir—look at me—I feel that I am in the presence of the Deity, while I speak. I know my follies---I know my vices, better, it may be, than they are known by any other human being---yet, so help me God! I never, in all my life, did one act to obtain the approbation of a living creature, contrary to the movement of my own heart. I never sacrificed my conscience for popularity---nor my honesty for praise. Is that vanity?” “Yes---the consummation of vanity.” “Well, if it be so---then, may I live and die consummately vain!---may I live, and die, with integrity of heart, proud and honest!” “As proudly, and as honestly; yea, as haughtily, as you please, Albert Hammond! That is not what I complain of-- it is the boasting of it—telling of it---priding yourself, in comparison with others.” “This, to me, William Adams---this, to me!---well, well---let us leave the subject now---we are both getting warm. What say you for a walk?” “And yet;” he stopped—“how idly the world judge; how foolishly! I am called vain, because I say that, expressly, like an honest man; which other men say, by implication, like dastards. Ask me my opinion of another-- and you cannot help respecting it. Ask me my opinion of myself, and you---(by you, I mean all the world) set it at nought. If I condemn my own work, it is thought a trick, to provoke contradiction:-- if I praise it, it is thought foolishness, and vanity, in me; no matter how just may be the censure, or the praise; no matter how well, or ill, it may correspond with the opinion of other men. Now, mark the difference. Suppose me a painter. I am called upon to say, what I think of one of my own pictures. My honest opinion is given. I do not seek the occasion— but I will not avoid it. I say, that I think it worth the public attention—worthy of being seen by the best judges—fitted for fellowship with the masterpieces of the day. I am derided for a vain simpleton. But another man, one of your modest men—when he is called upon, to express an opinion of his own work—will evade it—lie---or equivocate; declare that he is afraid, and ashamed of it—in doubt about the beauties, and alarmed at the faults, &amp;c. &amp;c. Therefore— he is called a modest man. Yet, wait a while. That very man—the modest man—will put his picture up in a publick exhibition room!—while I—it is probable, keep mine at home! He, thereby, proves, that his opinion of his own work, is as high, or higher, than my opinion of mine! Yet he is the modest man—I, the vain one. By showing his, to the publick, in such company, he proves, what his own opinion of it is—whatever he may say. So, with an author; one will publish, and make two or three volumes, out of what I would crowd into one— ornament his work with beautiful type—plates—get it reviewed by his friends—avow himself the author—in the very title page;—read it aloud, in company—talk about it;—and can repeat a whole volume; and yet, whimpers, and shuffles, whenever it is praised; or, whenever he is called upon to speak of it, like an honest man:—while I neither put my name to it, nor can, for the soul of me—read any thing that I have ever written, aloud—or remember a single page. Ah, such is the consistency of the world. Instead of being called vain—I ought to be called honest; and he—any thing but a modest man—or an honest man. I speak not of my judgment. That is another affair. They know, that I speak what I believe, of myself—and they know that your modest man never does. What! do I see no faults—no follies, in my own work. Believe me, sir—I see many, that no other eye can see—but then, I can see beauties too, that others will not see; and therefore, am I indulgent to myself—no, not indulgent: I am not. But let us walk.” It was a beautiful day—and we strolled, an hour, or two, so pleasantly, that—I had no heart for study, or contemplation, when I had returned. During the ramble, (I love to mention such things—they go far to show, the character of a man) we saw a person, at a distance, whom I knew by reputation—and had heard that a friend of Hammond, had studied with him. “What sort of a fellow is he?” said I. “He has the character of a scoundrel.” “He deserves it.” “And yet. your friend studied with him, once—and introduced him here. How happened it?” We were now in sight—“release me, for a moment,” said Hammond, “I have business with him.” Saying this, he left me, and walked directly over to the other; a few words passed between them. I saw Hammond's great eyes of a deadly blackness; and the sound of his voice, was full of deep, inward determination. The other was silent, and pale as a corpse. They did not exchange a dozen sentences. “What was your business?” said I—when he returned—“you appeared very much in earnest; and he is exceedingly disturbed—see!—he has stopped—ah, he is coming this way.” “Never mind him,” said Hammond—he won't come to us—he knows me, too well.” “By heaven, he has dashed the tears from his eyes —that movement of his hand—it could he for nothing else—what, on earth did you say to him?” “Merely”—said Hammond, with great unconcern— “never to speak to me again.” “And why?” said I—seeing that the man had gone back. “Because he is a weak hearted man—with no principle at all—who lives by his depredation upon society. A case has just come to my knowledge. He went to a store keeper whom I knew; and had cautioned, particularly, against him; and introduced one of the vilest scoundrels that ever walked unhung, to him, as a man of property, under some temporary embarrassment, on account of the seizure of some vessel;—a large quantity of goods, with some money, were thus obtained; and immediately deposited with an auctioneer, who found, after a time, that he had made too liberal an advance. The other scoundrel then went to him, and proposed, out of commiseration, to take the goods away, and return them to the shop-keeper; offering him, at the same time, his own notes, with “any security—any in the world, in exchange.” The auctioneer asked whom he could give.” “O!” said the other—“anybody—as many as you please—there is Mr. — so, and so—naming that man.” The auctioneer knew nothing more of him, than that he was a “gentleman of the bar,” and accepted the offer. That man endorsed the notes;—the goods were given up, to be returned; and were immediately put into another auction room, and sold under the hammer! —and all parties, petitioned, as it is called, off hand, for the benefit of the insolvent law!” “Gracious heaven!” said I—“are such things common?” “Aye—more yet. I heard a scuffle in the street— one Sunday; and bore it, till I could bear it no longer. I went out, and found two blackguard looking fellows, forcing a coloured woman, whom they had literally stripped half naked—along the street. A carriage stood by; and there was a tremendous out-cry, that she was a free woman; and that they were about carrying her to Georgia. I interfered; separated the scoundrels;— silenced the mob—and took the whole gang before a magistrate. This man, whom we have just left, was sent for, to defend the principal rascal; and with him, came the villain, whom this fellow assisted in the transaction about the goods. Both got a little saucy; and I took the liberty to treat them both, just as they deserved— particularly the latter, who never could look me in the face afterward, without trembling in every joint. It was exactly as we supposed. The negro woman was free. It was a damnably atrocious affair;—and, before a month had passed, I was consulted about a note, which had been given to that very man yonder, conditionally; to be his, if he prevailed! But he did not prevail. The woman was set free—yet he passed off the note!---as I was told.” “But is it true that your friend studied with him?” “No—he did not. But I'll tell you what he did.— He introduced him here; used all his influence, to get him established; and only abandoned him, when it was no longer possible for him to hear him named, without some disgraceful appellation. He spoke to him of an affair not long since, at the trial table, in court. He protested his innocence; prevaricated;—but, absolutely, burst into tears—and cried, William---cried, in the publick court room, with all the bar about them, while he was talking to him, in a low voice. I would have protected that man; shielded him, if I could, for the natural good disposition of his heart, for he would not willingly, and directly, wound the feeling, of any human creature.--- Beside, I had known his wife before he married her;--- a most estimable woman, and very beautiful---patient ---sorrowing---and---no matter, William; I cannot talk of such things.” “But what are his talents?” “As a scholar—contemptible: As a practitioner, and advocate, tolerable; for he is cunning and experienced. In no other respect, is he either a learned man, or a man of talent.” “You knew him before he appeared here?” “Yes—He was in great practice, in my native town; became a political man; received an appointment in the army—and was cashiered. That was enough for me; and when I next saw him, I treated him coolly. It was sufficient for me, that such a judgment had been pronounced upon him; but, when I found a villanous propensity in him, to run in debt whenever he could—where-ever he could, and for whatever he could, I despised him more heartily than I can express. But, by some chance, I read his trial. I was amazed. He was an injured man. The court had not treated him fairly; and I feel now that what he did, was right;—and that he ought not to have been broken. I only blame him for not doing it more boldly, and avowing it, like a man. You know that our nature is, where we have wronged one, to make any expiation, any atonement. I could not sleep, therefore, till I had got him, by the greatest exertion, into a respectable acquaintance, and practice. Nay—I went further, I entered my name with him as a student; and, during his absence, staid in his office once, for a week or two; but I never studied with him, or any other man. I studied in my own rooms, after my own fashion. At last, I found it necessary to abandon him; and entered my name with that fiery, impetuous, noble hearted fellow, of whom you have heard me speak so often, with such enthusiasm.” “And tears, almost,” said I—“shall you ever forget him? think you?” “Forget him!—no!—when I do—may heaven forget me.” “He stopped; but I continued to hear his voice long afterward, sounding in my ears.” Thus was the character of Hammond perpetually unfolding to me; and, always, like some vast map; or, rather, tapestry, with a constantly encreasing beauty and proportion. The spots, and broken lines; and disordered colouring, grew into rivers and mountains; and became animate with population and intelligence. Yet, I dwelt upon him, I cannot deny it, with a feeling, rather of awe than affection. It appeared to me that we were too nearly alike; not in talent, certainly; but in disposition, ever to be truly intimate. We were both too imperious; unconditional; unsocial; unyielding, ever to be permanently united in friendship. I told him so; but he smiled, and bade me wait with patience— that—if I would wrestle with my devil, he would, with his. “Mine!”—said I, “what is it?—Ambition?” “Jealousy. You have many little devils—but Jealousy is the master among them.” I could not believe him;—but, when he found that I was in downright earnest,—that I was really astonished at the charge, he laid his two hands upon mine, with a strange solemnity and emphasis, like one conjuring up devils, out of the sea;—and bade me “beware of jealousy.” I laughed, and reminded him of Iago.— But his eyes filled; and I began to feel an unaccountable apprehension of myself—“Hark! hark!” said he; ---just then— We were startled by shrieks,—and, after listening for a moment, discovered that they came from a lone house at a distance in the wood—it was a cry of murder! —murder!—My heart stopped for a moment, and then I ran toward the place; but Hammond had outstripped me: burst into the house; and stood---I cannot well say how;—but, when I entered, I saw a savage looking old man, with eyes like a wild cat, sitting in a dark corner, his face all grown over with grisly hair.---and watching Hammond with such malignity, that I suspected some evil purpose. I was right---he was gradually getting his hand about the hilt of a shoemaker's knife, behind him. I saw a bright, quick, sharp glitter---but Hammond was two keen for him;---he dashed him to the earth, and wrenched the knife from him---while he was prostrate, frothing and bleeding at the mouth and nostrils. We soon found out the cause of the uproar.--- The monster had been beating a family of women; his own mother, an aged bed ridden woman; another, that lived with him; and a young girl, all as ragged and dirty, as disease and wretchedness could make them. He had beaten them, in mere wantonness, because he had fallen, in a state of intoxication, and broken a bottle of whiskey. “What a picture!” said Hammond, wiping his eyes, many minutes after we had left the house.—“That miserable wretch is left there, to tyrannise over three human creatures, with a disposition, deadly enough for any crime; their lives coustantly exposed to him, I dare say---and utterly helpless. Of what materials ---how disorderly and strange---this world is made up! How the morals of our countrymen have degenerated! Time was, when the noise of a single murder would ring from one end of the United States to the other.--- But now, murder, robbery, rape are so common, that they are forgotten, in our little city, within a week after they have happened. In truth, my dear friend, it is a fearful trade, this of mine---this of exploring the blackest recesses of the blackest hearts---walking, bare foot, and naked, (for so it is, while you are uncontaminated by the moral pestilence,) among the ruin and fire, and rottenness of passions, that have burnt out; and hearts that have decayed under the visitation of obscenity, vice and profligacy.” “Yet, after all, society here, like society every where else, has a latent wickedness, that will always be given out by compression:---like heat, from the coldest metal. The more crowded and confined it is ---the more this evil is apparent.” “And the very remedies, that we invent, operate as a reward and encouragement, to vice and beggary.” “It is our own fault. We have zeal without knowledge. Every day, we are speculating, with all our resources, on questions of political economy, which, while we call them discoveries---have been tried “out and vol. ii. S out,” among the nations of Europe; and exploded, as pernicious and destructive. Our nature is, never to try experiments on paper, nor with models, but to go to the business at once, whether of revenue, finance, or legislation. We have blundered, till our best efforts to suppress beggary and theft, are-little else, than established permiums for both. Like the lying-in hospital of Catharine, which has became so powerful and august a defender of misfortune, that it is no longer discreditable to a Russian girl, to have had a child before marriage—to have “borne children to the state.” In that country, the natural shame of woman, is a matter of political profit. And so too, the pleasant invention at Pekin, to suppress population, by permitting mothers to expose their “naked, new born babes,” to be devoured by dogs. What is the consequence? Instead of operating to retard population, says Malthus, it encourages it, directly, by removing from the minds of people, all apprehension about the support of their children. Boys and girls marry, therefore, under that permission, to destroy their offspring, if they cannot maintain them; who, if they were obliged to maintain their children, would live apart. But why should we complain? Our whole system of legislation is radically defective. We reprobate certain crimes, and yet permit them. We condemn gambling and drunkenness---yet raise a revenue, by licensing * * * * * * and tippling shops. Nay---do we not raise a revenue from the billiard tables, and the bagnio?— Yes.” “How!” said I---“what mean you?” “The same thing, in effect. In one case, we call it a penalty; in the other, a license. No real difference exists in the thing; and therefore, all moral distinctions are confounded. If you say to a man, that he shall not keep a faro table, under a penalty of one hundred dollars; what is it, but to say, that he may keep it, for one hundred dollars? And if you say, that another may keep a tippling shop for ten dollars a year---what is it but to say that, he shall not keep it, under a penalty of ten dollars. In New England, they had a law, forbidding any one to ride on a Sunday, under a penalty of five dollars. What was this, but saying to the rich man--- you may ride---and to the poor man, you shall not— or, you may ride on a Sunday, for five dollars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Hammond and Elizabeth...Explanation...Quarrel...Ambition... Heroick nature...Elizabeth's testimony...Sickness...Reconciliation...Atonement. Some weeks after the conversation related in the last chapter, I discovered a visible change, in the deportment of Hammond; and I thought, now and then, that I could perceive a growing intelligence, between him and my sister. I watched them; and, at length, determined to speak to him, about it. I sat down and brought him immediately to the point, with feelings, that I cannot express. I fear that they were feelings of hatred and scorn. I could not bear to think, or imagine it possible, that he had now; damnation!—the tears scald my eyes, while I speak;—a heart like hers, so affectionate, so innocent, and so lofty. I meant to speak calmly—but, I could not. “Mr. Hammond,” said I, “What do you mean by your attention to Elizabeth?” He turned a little pale, I thought; but replied, very calmly.—You address me, William, in a strange way. I am afraid that you are disposed to quarrel with me. Are you?” “I don't know—that depends upon your answer.” “William Adams,” he said, in a voice, and with a manner that appalled me. I know not, that I ever felt so utterly contemptible. “William Adams, I pity you.” “By heaven!” I eried, starting up, with passion and seizing him by the colar. I—I—. (I was choking.) He gently released himself; and then, sat down again, with the same immoveable composure. I was ashamed of mpself—the blood rushed, like a scorching fire, over my throat. I felt it—I knew it; I knew that I looked like a petulant fool; and I would rather have been shot through the heart. “How dare you,” said I—gasping with rage—and literally unable to keep my hands quiet, though I grappled my knees, and held them, with all my might, while I spoke. “How dare you think of—of—.” “Of—of—.” “Of what?—of whom?” “Of Elizabeth!” said he, mildly. “Ah, of Elizabeth. How dare you pronounce her name? How dare you call her anything, but Miss Adams?” He looked at me, with compassion—he took my hands within his—they trembled—and my eyes were full—and so was my heart.---I could not speak—no, not to save my soul: and, but for the shame of the thing, I would have fallen upon his neck, and wept. “William,” said he, “something has disturbed you. I have told you, before, of your jealousy---warned you against it, with all the affectionate interest of a brother. You have insulted me. You have no right to expect an answer to your question; but, nevertheless, I will answer it. You ask me, why I am so attentive to your sister? I answer, temperately, I hope---because I reverence her. Would I win her heart---ha!—you are very cruel, William—your sneering, and scoffing, and bitterness, almost tempt me to say, that I could win it---nay, I am not quite sure of myself, yet---do not provoke me! I thought that I could bear anything, from you; but, do not drive me mad. If you do---if you once mock at me, till I threaten to win her heart, by the God that made me, William Adams, ugly as I am, yea! though I were ten thousand times more ugly, I would win her heart, or break it---yea, I would!” What kept me silent? What held down my arms--- just as if they were pinioned with iron! I was not three feet from his head, while he spoke; and I would have crushed it with my foot, if I could, before he had finished that sentence. But, I was immoveable---helpless---and he went on. “Mr. Adams—William,” said he; “you do not deserve that I should answer you: but, I will. It will be a lesson to you. I venerate your sister. I think of her, as of something better than woman---but, I dare not love her. I should feel that it was impious. You look relieved. Nay, more—bright, and peerless, and beautiful vol ii. S 2 as she is, I do not believe, were I better fashioned; and more highly gifted, that, I should dare to aspire to her. Yet more; for, I would have your tossed heart reposing once more; (his voice faltered; and his hands gradually relaxed)—I love another woman—I cannot tell you, what she is, nor who—but, I love her; yea, so tenderly and truly, that, I never mean to approach her again. I cannot marry. God hath set his canon against that; and I fear for my strength, if we meet. I fear for hers. I dnow that she might love me; for, what woman would not love one, who rules over other men, if she may rule over him? My resolutions have been made, alone; undisturbed by passion, trial or tempting. I know, that it would be wrong for a sick man, or a monster, to marry. I shall adhere to them. My course is a perilous one; but, it is a steep one; and will lead me the sooner, where I pant to set my foot once; and unlock my bosom, to the Father of all men; though it be but for a moment; though the next wind blow my ashes from the precipice. My fate is hard, William, very hard—to do what I have done; and yet, to be doubted; where I have toiled hardest to establish a confidence, that nothing should shake—to have it shaken to the dust, with the very breath of man. You know something of my nature, William—but, you know little of the tender and affectionate disposition of my heart. God hath given me a yearning after loveliness—an insatiable desire to make some sweet, innocent woman happy—to love, and be loved. Yet, he hath set his seal of ugliness, upon me—warped, and distorted his own image, impregnate with divinity as it is, into a creature, so shapeless and deformed, that his own heart rises with bitterness; and he could lie down, and curse his Maker, if he were a bad man, for having made him what he has. But, as it is, he can only lie down, and weep, that he hath been made so ugly. It is hard to bear, my friend. I have enough to try me, without your unkindness; enough to turn the heart of an angel, to a stone—when I feel, what I might have been, were it lawful for me to perpetuate my being; with a wife to lean upon my bosom; and children to bless me, and weep upon my hands---You feel it, William. I see that you do. But, how can you feel the sorrow and proscription; the fearful abstinence that I am doomed to —trembling all over, with sensibility; a heart, alive to every delicate, and every beautiful emotion; obliged, that it may not be mocked to death, with derision and insult—to conceal its tenderness and love—to case itself in a panoply of steel—far too stern for its gentleness. Why, my brother!---O, why was I not fashioned, outwardly, like other men!---or inwardly, like a brute beast! I might then, have been happy. But now--- O, let me not question the goodness of our Heavenly Father! Now, I am fitted, in spirit for all the offices of love and ambition---warlike by nature: full of high thought, and heroick purpose; yet, prohibited---branded---and bodily incapable of reining a war-horse....or, subduing a woman. Nay, so fashioned, that, with my heart, I tremble, even at the approach of beauty; and, shake at the sound of a trumpet---lest I should leave devils behind me, if I yielded to her---or become one, myself, if I should once snuff up the blood of men, in battle.” I threw myself into his arms. I could bear it no longer. I locked my hands in his; and I wept upon them. “Hammond! Hammond!” I cried, “forgive me!” “Yes, William---my friend! William!....I do forgive you: but it is hard, very hard, to be interrogated so imperiously, by a young man; on a subject so tender too, ---but, I do forgive you. Leave me, William....you shall hear from me, in the morning.” He drove me from him, with a gentle violence; and it was only, when I found myself sitting by Elizabeth, and heard her ask how Mr. Hammond was, that I recollected enough of what had passed, to feel all the folly of what I had done---all the cruelty, I should say. I could not answer her, but took her pretty hands between mine, and pressed them to my lips. She put her mouth to my forehead; and leaned her smooth cheek there; for a moment, and, directly after, I felt the tears trickling over my temples. I was able to speak, then. “He is well,” said I; but, as I looked up, the blood flushed so suddenly over her whole face, that I started upon my feet-“Elizabeth!—Elizabeth!—speak to me!” I cried, “do you love me?” “Love you. William! can you ask me such a question?” I knew not what possessed me—the devil, Jealousy, again—I would not share, even a sister's heart. I believe, with any thing mortal—and I broke out upon her, at once. “Tell me—tell me—Do you—do—do—do you love Hammond?” She staggered—put her little white hands to her temples—turned as pale as death—and fell, without life or motion, upon the sofa. I knelt by her side—I wept upon her neck; and when the wind blew her soft hair all over my face and eyes, and she turned to me, with her lids half shut---in death, it appeared to me--- I thought that I should drop down at her feet.” “Elizabeth!---Elizabeth!--- O, do speak to me. “What shall I say, brother?” The delirium was yet upon me---I knew not what made me---but I said to her—. “Tell me---assure me, on your soul, that you do not love Hammond?” She covered her face with her hands--and the bright tears gushed through her fingers---and her shoulders and bosom, nay, her very arms glowed crimson, under the transparent muslin. I was indignant, exasperated again. “I have seen it all. I have watched you—the villain.” That was the chord! that was all that she wanted! By heaven, the fire flashed, for half a minute, from her blue eyes—and there was an intense eloquence, hot and penetrating, upon her lips. She sprang upon her feet--sat down---as if struggling with herself, and then, arose---calmly, but awfully---and stood before me, like some creature, about to sit in judgment upon me. I covered my face before her---I could not endure the lustre of her eyes. “Of whom, do you speak, William!---Who is hte villain?” “Albert Hammond!” said I, passionately, “Albert Hammond, girl! the obscene and loathsome Hammond—the horrible, and black hearted—the—.” “Albert Hammond!” said she, locking her hands, fevently; her mute lips gently, devontly stirring, for a moment, as if—as if, in prayer and benediction. “He a villain! the lion hearted—glorious, glorious Hammond! Loathsome and obscene! he!—into whom God, even our own God, hath infused a treble portion of his hottest essence! He! whose thought is power! whose words are eloquence! the movement of whose mind is brightness and dominion! whose heart is the appointed habitation of overpowering purity and virtue!— Horrible and black hearted! He! who, when he was spit upon, reviled and buffetted, like the Saviour of men, reviled not again! O, Albert! Albert! how has thy great spirit been abused!” “Elizabeth! woman! sister! dear sister!” I cried, blinded and stunned by her enthusiasm, and plucking at her uplifted hands; “look down upon me, my sister! you will drive me distracted!” Her voice grew fainter and fainter; until it had died utterly away; but her hands remained yet, lifted and locked; and her parted lips still moved—but without a sound, or murmur. Her whole countenance was luminous—her whole form intensely animate, like some indignant, spiritual thing, colouring all over with shame, and stooping with sorrow. Her bright hair fell like a thick radiance about her; and her snow white forehead gleamed through it, like the front of a dead infant, with her temples of stained blue. I was humbled to the earth—I attempted to embrace her—I even put my hands upon her shoulders; but they fell off powerless; and my lips parted with terrour as they approached; and I was gradually sinking down to her feet, with confusion, shame, and humiliation, when the door opened, and Hammond, himself, entered, with a disordered aspect, and an agitated voice.” I caught his eye—first—and then Elizabeth caught it. A new spirit blazed from her face, as she did so; an impatient, inward sound, like the warbling of her very heart followed—before, he could articulate distinctly. She put out her hand to him, like a queen. She did! and the colour flashed over her face, like the sunset—and he took it—blast him! “Come hither, Albert Hammond,” said she, “come hither—Are you friends!” “Yes” he replied, calmly. “What think you, that brother of mine has dared to ask me?” “I know not,” said Hammond, turning very pale “nothing, I hope, that—.” “Nothing but this, Albert---whether I loved you.” I was thunderstruck. What! Elizabeth Adams capable of talking thus, to a man! She put her hands to his lips---curse on his lips--- and she bore it---aye! and her eyes floated with expression---tenderness!---love!---damnation.—I dashed away the hand that I had caught; I rushed to the door---but her voice arrested me. “Brother William!” said she, “one moment!---we are about doing somewhat, I fear, that will be fatal to our love. Do not leave me, in that temper! We may never meet again---will you go?” I dashed away the tears from my eyes, and answered, “yes, I will go! go, where you shall never see me again.” “Well then, rash man, if it be so, go! I can bear it as well as you. I have as stout a heart, stouter, I believe---a---a (her voice deepened.) I burst the door open, with my foot, and staggered, like one blinded and death struck, by some unknown visitation, down the stair case, and out, into the wind. I hardly knew what happened to me afterward, for some time; I was sick, very sick; and the thought came over me, that I had shattered some of the vessels of my heart; and that I could feel them weeping, drop by drop---all day long, and all night. After this, there was another night of darkness--flashes of beautiful fire went through it; and voices, like those of children in the grass; and then, I was in that strange, desolate old house again. And the next thing, that I remember is, that a soft face lay near to mine, upon the same pillow---that I thought it was Elizabeth; and tried again and again to kiss it, but it constantly vanished---and the beautiful mouth kept curling at me; and the shadowy tresses, that were all over the pillow, while I attempted to put my hand upon them, moved off, like glittering snakes, under a transparency. The effect was very strange. Every thing about me seemed to be confined within an impenetrable fluid, as clear as glass. In short, I was vehemently shattered in brain and constitution; and when I recovered, so as to recollect all that had passed; I found Elizabeth at my side, pale with watching. I opened my eyes, and spoke to her; and she instantly burst into tears. “O, my brother! my brother!” she cried, sobbing with her wet mouth pressed to mine—“O, forgive me!” “Forgive you, dear—what have I to forgive you for?” We embraced; and I could not be easy, until I had sent for Hammond; and begged his pardon; truly and extremely penitent, as I was, with a humbled and contrite heart. My very nature had changed—I determined to ask no more questions; nay, not even, if I lost her for ever—but to let it wear patiently, upon me—even unto death. “I hope that you will be well enough next week,” said Hammond, as he parted from me, one evening, “to go abroad. I have an important case to try; a great constitutional question; and I should like to have you present—as you may never have another opportunity. You are going far from us---life is precarious---all iron, as I have been---I am so no longer; and, there is no knowing what may happen.” I was deeply affected with his manner, and watched the movement and expression of his face, till I half persuaded myself, that he was a doomed man. “Are you ill, Hammond?” said I. “I am not well,” was the reply. “Do you believe--you cannot--you are strangely pale---what has happened to you, within these last few days?” “Within these last few days!---nothing---some disease, I know not what, has taken possession of me; and I am---yes, let me say it, for I feel it—I am weary of life.” “My conduct, it may be,” said I, reproachfully. “Yes, William. I cannot deny it---your conduct has done much, to make me sick and tired of my very existence. When I see a man like you, so forgetful of all the charities and decencies of life--I do not want to hurt you, but it is now too late for concealment, to be serviceable to either of us---when I see such a man, utterly forgetful of all the duties of friendship---what have I left to wish for? We are ambitious only; we toil and battle only---tread the precipices of war, slippery with blood---the heights of glory, burning and crumbling with excessive heat, only that some loved one may be the happier and prouder for it---some loved one, however, that loves us; some friend! some wife! or child! or father, or mother! I have no father---no mother---no child--no wife---no friend.” Saying these words, he left me, before I could prevent him; but, all night long, I heard his voice continually sounding in my ear, no friend! no friend! I have no friend!</field>

My health grew better, and better, every day; and I was confidently hoping in that restoration, which would give it permanency; lay the unquiet spirit within me; and pour enough of balsam, and warmth, into my bruised heart; to keep out the wintry feeling, and the distracted one, with which it had been lately so familiar:—and one evening, after I had been much happier than usual, as I sat with my arm round my dear Elizabeth's waist; and leaning my cheek upon her shoulder, while she read to me; for she read with exquisite feeling; delicacy, and judgment; and I so loved to hear her plaintive tones, wandering through all the chambers, of my heart, like one that holds his breath to hear, in his old age, the song that captivated him, in his boyhood—the melodies that he first loved; and first wept over--ah! I was very happy; and suddenly, I observed a change of tone—one, that I thought the passage did not require; I was half asleep and dreaming—but I opened my eyes, then; and observed some appearance of confusion in hers. I saw the cause. It was Hammond—he was passing the window, on horseback; and I do not wonder, that she trembled; for, never, since the creation of the world, I do believe, was there so unsightly a creature in the saddle. He reined the animal with great strength; and perfect self-command; and sat firmly, in the seat; but—he looked rather like a lump, than a man. I believe that I smiled; a little bitterly too; for Elizabeth shut the book hastily; and turned away her face; and her little hand, upon which mine lay, twitched convulsively, for a minute, or two, under mine.— The door opened. Vol. ii. T Hammond, himself, entered, before we had broken the silence; and she addressed him, with a firm, kind manner, which I could not, though I tried hard, bring myself to like. “Are you fond of writing?” said Elizabeth. “Very,” was the reply---his great shining eyes, all alive, with the exercise; and his countenance flushed. I never saw him look so handsome.---She gave him her hand; but I thought that he hesitated to touch it; and, when he did, a mortal lividness shot upward from his lips, to his temples. “Why do you ask?” said he, respectfully. “Because,” she continued, looking him steadily in the face---“because I do not like to see you on horseback.” “I thank you,” he replied, rather haughtily, I thought---but he immediately repeated, in a tone of deep quiet, and profound thankfulness; that, I am sure, came from the bottom of his heart. “I thank you!--- I shall ride no more. I understand your motive. It is a blessed one---and I have felt it---felt it, bitterly, before; but I have striven to overcome it, as weak, and paltry. My opinion is changed now; that cannot be weak, and paltry, which all the feelings of my heart swell against---and, that certainly, cannot be unworthy of my attention---which Elizabeth Adams can find the heart to condemn.” “Damn your familiarity!” had half escaped me--- but I gasped---and merely looked at them, successively---till they understood me, coloured, and smiled. I felt a rising bitterness here---here!---and there is no knowing, what might have followed; for my new blood, after all, was of the same temperature, as my old---it thrilled and curdled, as readily, at the touch of Hammond's flesh, to my sister's, as if a rattlesnake had been put into my own bosom---naked---but just then, the door opened, and a clergyman, whom we well knew, was shown in. He was a man, under whom I had once been at school; a strong minded, ambitious man; of singular power, in his way; and absolute, in his influence, beyond all example. I had once encountered him in a stage coach, many years after he had humbled me; and, I never left him, till I had humbled him to the dust. He had been bitterly mistaken in me; for my pleasantries were those of a light hearted fellow; thoughtless, and free; rather than those of an habitual trifler. The truth is---that I was challenged, to make him laugh, if I could-- for he had not been known to laugh for years; and the gentleman with me, had once stood in such awe of him, that what he said, was listened to by him, as the indisputable declaration of God, himself---miraculously communicated to man. After this challenge, I made the attempt, and was eminently successful; for, I kept the minister in one continual smile, for two or three hours---and, two or three times, produced a downright laugh. But, at last, he undertook to curry me down, as he was accustomed to curry down, the wisest of his own congregation. I kicked a little---and then, he abused me. I bore it, till I could bear it no longer. I opened upon him, then, at his own weapons; and fairly beat him into his entrenchments; and beat him after he was there. The fact was, that they had fallen to decay. He had never considered the other side of the question, which we disputed about:— he had learnt his particular belief, as a trade; as a matter of subsistence; and had been so long accustomed to dictation, that it threw him off his balance, when he found any one ready to oppose him. To him---it was downright rebellion. But the lesson was a good one; and, before I left him, he treated me with profound respect.” I was glad to see him here---very glad; and Elizabeth too, I could perceive, was not less so. She had long wanted to pit Hammond, against him, upon some doctrine, on which she held to the clergyman's belief; and reprobated Hammond's; and she manifested, I thought, no little dexterity in bringing on the battle, here---for, after some skirmishing with the outpost, there was a fair held fight---somewhat after the following fashion, between the two. “For my part, I never meddle with metaphysicks. They are, in a measure, incomprehensible to me, if not prohibited,” said Elizabeth, in answer to some question of the clergyman's, whose name was Paynim.” “They are better never meddled with;” said Hammond. “They only serve to bewilder, and perplex. I remember, that I spent, at one time, of my life, many a sleepless night, upon the doctrine of Free agency.” “And, what restored you?” said the clergyman---- interrupting him. “My own reasoning,” was the reply. “I toiled to the precipice---and then I awoke.” “I am glad to hear it,” answered Mr. Paynim. “It has always been a matter of astonishment to me, that any rational man could pretend to doubt, what he has the evidence of his own senses to prove---his own liberty; his own moral freedom. You smile:—sir--perhaps, I have misunderstood you. It may be—I beg your pardon, if I am wrong—that you have not arrived to the conclusion, which I hoped.” “I believe, that I have not, sir;” was the calm reply of Hammond. “Can it be possible, sir? You surely have never thought much upon the matter---but then, people have believed, or affected to believe, in stranger things.--- Surely you cannot have thought much upon it.” “Sir!” said Hammond; turning slowly, toward him; and raising his hand in that impressive, cold, solemn way; as if every word that he uttered, were set down at the moment, by a recording angel—“Sir! I have thought of it. Night and day, have I thought of it, for whole years. A friend, a dear friend roused the lion in my heart---five years ago---and he has not slept since. And I have never been happy since. It was injudicious in him; but the spirit that one man may disturb, legions may not quell.” “And pray, sir---Mr. Hammond, I believe, (Hammand bowed)---a— you came then, to a conclusion--- pray, what was that conclusion?” “Are you determined to hear it?” “Certainly not, if you are seriously disposed against telling it—or ashamed of it—or afraid---- or—” “Sir,” said Hammond—his dark eyes filling, all at once, with starlight, and beauty. “I am neither afraid, nor ashamed, of any thing. My opinion, sir! It is this---that there is no such thing as freedom. That God only can be free—and that freedom is Omnipotence.” “But you take away man's accountability, by that doctrine,” said Mr. Paynim, peevishly; and confound moral with physical freedom.” “Yes—I know it; moral and physical freedom are inseparable. I hold too, that man will not be punished for any thing that he does.” “Nor rewarded?” continued the other, eagerly. “Nor rewarded,” echoed Hammond; “that is a part of your own doctrine, that there is no merit in man's good actions.” “And you make the Deity, the author of sin,” said Mr. Paynim—with a scornful, but compassionate expression of the lip. “Yes, sir—of all, that you call sin. All that happens, happens by his permission; nay, by his authority. He can prevent it, but does not. He is infinitely wise, good, powerful:---of course, what we call sin, is consistent with infinite wisdom, goodness, and power. Nay, more---God is the author of all law, the violation of which constitutes sin. Being the author, he can suspend it at pleasure. It is only necessary, therefore, that he should suspend, any given prohibition, and the prohibited deed becomes lawful. Is it not so? God peopled the world at first, by an incestuous communion, between the sons and daughters of Adam. He sent his angel among the nations; and they melted away in the breath of his nostrils. The earth runs with blood at his bidding. He commands one man to slay another---nay, to slay thousands, and tens of thousands!---He orders the Egyptians, to be spoiled of their gold and silver, by the Israelites; he permits his chosen one, David, to sin upon the house top with a woman. Here then are murder, adultery, incest, and theft, all done by his direct authority. And what is the consequence? They cease to be criminal. vol ii. T 2 Abraham is commanded to offer up Isaac.---- He proceeds to the work of death. Suppose, that he had done it.” “But he would never have done it,” said the clergyman. “Ah!” replied Hammond; “then why is Abraham celebrated for his faith, and obedience? But, suppose, that he had done it; who would have dared to censure him? Who would have dared to resist the angel of the Lord? This night---suppose, sir, that this night, one of us should be convinced, in his understanding, and heart, by a vision, that he was ordered of God to offer up some babe---and suppose that he obeyed. Would he sin?” “No---he would he a madman. The age of such communication with heaven, is past.” “You see---sir,” said Hammond, with increasing solemnity; “that, what we call sin, when done, or authorized by God, ceases to be sin. Nay---if you pursue it for a moment, you will see, that, without sin, there would be no virtue—no suffering---and, consequently, no patience, fortitude, compassion, sympathy, resignation---nor piety,--no virtue, nor shadow of virtue. It is a subject, sir, which I hoped to avoid; many, and many a weary, sleepless night, have I passed; and I had nearly come to the resolution once, of never speaking upon it, again; and I do it now, with reluctance. I long to hear it refuted---sir! as I am a living man, I would go down on my knees, before any human being, who would convince me, that I am a free agent---morally free; capable of doing right and wrong.” “I would recommend professor Reid, to you,” said the other, as if he pitied Hammond. “Professor Reid!---Sir, I have read him, through and through; again, and again. I mean no disrespect to you; but I am more familiar with him than you are. He has deceived himself; no wonder that he has deceived others. He is the champion of your side; but I have set my foot upon his neck. Professor Reid!--- yes, sir; and, after reading, and writing, upon the subject; and refuting professor Reid, and discomfiting every man that opposed me; making converts, when I neither sought, nor desired it; awing presumption into silence; and prejudice into nothingness, I met with the letters, that passed between Frederick and Voltaire, on the subject; and I found that I had answered—without ever having seen them; the very doubts and objections, on both sides, which Frederick and Voltaire, themselves, had pronounced to be unanswerable.” “Can you pretend to believe that you are not free--- Mr. Hammond, when you are acting every hour of your life, as if you believe it; and, are continually planning for the future”---said Elizabeth. “My dear Miss Adams,” said he, with an air of the deepest, and most affectionate sincerity. “That is man's nature. Who acts according to his belief? Nobody. We believe that there are no apparitions---no spectres; yet we are all more or less frightened in the dark. We believe that we shall die, every one of us, and be judged. Yet, who acts as if he really believed it. We know that death is inevitable---yet we act as if we knew that it could not happen.” “But why should we reason?” said Elizabeth, interfering again, to keep down the warmth of Hammond. “Do we not feel in every pulse, thought, and throb, that we are free?” “Yes!--that is the unanswerable argument after, all,” said Mr. Paynim;---“we have the highest possible evidence of our freedom; and, therefore, we are free.” “Professor Reid says the same thing,” Hammond replied. “But I answer thus:—In the first place, it is not true that we have this evidence. In the next place; if we had it, it would not prove that we are free,---and finally, though our consciousness and our understanding should unite in their testimony to our freedom— still, they might deceive us—still we might not be so.” “Upon my word!”---cried the clergyman, breathless with astonishment, “What evidence would you have?” “I would have the evidence of my reason, because it is higher than that of consciousness,—not because it would be conclusive.” “But are not the evidence of your reason, and consciousness the same thing?”---said Elizabeth. “Ah, my dear Miss Adams,” said the clergyman, smiling, “you had better not trouble your head any more with metaphysicks.” “Why not?” answered Hammond, seriously.---“I am sure, that she makes the proper distinction between reason and the evidence of reason.” You will find her able to comprehend your most attenuated and subtle distinctions”---(Elizabeth blushed, and bowed)---he continued. “No---I care little, or nothing, for what the wise have said on the subject. I have my own notions. Consciousness in us, is like instinct in animals. It is something, that anticipates the deduction of reason;---something, that is antecedent to experience. However, it matters little in what sense we use it here: for, a little reflection will convince us, that consciousness is not infallible. A dreamer, a lunatick, a disordered man; one in a passion, or intoxicated;---each will have a consciousness that is false,---each will be conscious for a time, that he is, what he is not. A crazed old man may be conscious that he is a monarch. Is he a monarch? A drunken man may be conscious that he is sober. Is he sober? A dreamer may feel a consciousness, that he is tumbling from a precipice. Is he tumbling from a precipice? Unless you answer in the affirmative, that man is, whatever, he is conscious of being, you must give up the point that man is free, because he is conscious of being free. Just so, may his understanding play false---his reason.” “But,” said the clergyman, “You have not shown what you promised, that we have not this consciousness.” “It would require too much time. I can only speak for myself. I never propose to do a thing, or even resolve to do it; but, in a qualified way. I do not feel convinced that I am at liberty to do anything.” “Nay---that is too bad,” said I---“You do not feel satisfied or convinced, at this moment, that you are at liberty to lift your hand to your face!” “No---when I reflect upon it, I do not. While I only feel, I admit that I act, as if I did feel free; and that is only while I do not think at all. Many things might happen to prevent me; a change of mind; some muscular affection; the cramp; palsy or death. You smile--- and, not, if you will allow me to say so, as—but no matter. All, that we do, is subject to some accident, restraint, or contingency. So, all that we resolve to do.” “Why, sir, if I understand you right, you make freedem to consist in entire independence---(said the clergyman)—in a sort of animal power—not a moral power, of choice.” “True, sir—in a moral power, which is incapable of physical control—in OMNIPOTENCE. You are startled —but—” “I am—I confess it—if your doctrine be at all just, only one Being can be free.” That is exactly what I said, when I began, sir, “answered Hammond.” “And yet,” said Elizabeth, timidly, her pleasant, lovely, impatient eyes dashed with shadow and light, as she raised them reverently to the clergyman;—“I have always been led to beheve, that guilt or innocence were in the mind, alone;—that he, who meditates a murder, though he be unable to complete it, is a murderer;—that moral guilt is in the thought—not in the deed;—that he who kills another, without intending it, is innocent; and that he, who puts poison into the food of another, which is not eaten; or gives a balsam, by mistake, when he would drug another's heart with death, is a murderer in his soul; morally guilty of all that he meditated.” “Surely, surely, Mr. Hammond.” she continued, stretching her beautiful hand toward him, till she almost touched his shoulder, in her passionate, sweet, yet lifted earnestness—“the guilt of the heart need not be consummated” by the guilt of the hand!—and, if not—of what matter is it, whether we are free to do what we determine, or not, provided that we are free to determine?” The clergyman's eyes ran over—and he held her hands in his, for a moment.---“Beautiful enthusiast,” he said---and the words broke from his lip in fire---“he trembles from head to foot! --this is using your power and loveliness, upon the earth, as your Heavenly Father would have you!” Hammond's broad forehead lightened, absolutely lightened, as he repeated---“Beautiful enthusias! yes— right or wrong, ye will be followed!—who may resist your enchantment!—not the strong of heart; for, at the sound of your voices, the stout hearted fail!—not the powerful in mind, for, at your bidding, they lie down in the dust! like giants fainting before an incantation. But no—I will withstand you:—for truth is mightier than beauty; wisdom, than loveliness. God is truth. “Suppose,” he added, approaching Elizabeth, and speaking in a low, composed tone, with action full of solemnity and emphasis. “Suppose that it should prove---let me suppose the case---that, he who drugged the food of another with poison---was not at liberty---but did it under some preternatural, hidden, but irresistible influence, would he be guilty? Suppose that one, operated upon by physical force, or by persuasion, and by nothing else--to kill another, nay, to strike another with an intention to kill him, would he be guilty? It might be, you know, for self preservation--- as if he were thrust against another---upon a piece of ice, where only one could stand. Suppose him to be excited to it by wine, or eloquence, or fanatacism, or visions from heaven, or madness---would he be guilty, then?” “You crowd your questions too thickly upon me,” answered Elizabeth. “Yet, I should think him guilty, only in proportion as he was free; and that his guiltiness diminished, exactly in proportion to the influence operating upon him, whether intellectual or corporeal.” “Thank you,” cried Hammond; “thank you, Eliza--- Miss Adams, I mean. Now we are coming to the point! We shall soon become altogether intelligible to each other. We are not so wide of the truth, as we have imagined. The drunken man: the crazed one: the fanatick---each may have given the blow, with an intent to kill—each believing that he was free—yet, after all, when God shall try him, his guilt or innocence will depend, as you have already admitted, not upon his own belief, or consciousness of freedom; not upon the intention to kill—but, upon the fact, whether he was really free or not—(whatever were his belief:)—and he will be guiltless of blood, in proportion to the influence that operated upon him.” The clergyman regarded him with alarm, as he proceeded. “You are wrong, therefore, Elizabeth; and Dr. Reid, great and good as he may have been, is wrong; and all of you are wrong. Let me give you, substantially, one of Dr. Reid's arguments. The foreknowledge of God, said he, is no more incompatible with man's freedom, than his memory is: that is, if we had no faculty of memory; it would be as inconceivable to us, as foreknowledge is now. We could never be made to comprehend, how he could remember a thing that was past; any more than we can now comprehend, how he should foreknow a thing, that is to come, without, in some way, affecting the liberty of the agent. Now, it is true, says Dr. Reid, that we are able to comprehend it, &amp;c. &amp;c.---but why repeat such an argument: alas, for the wisdom and honesty of such men. Their blindness would be inconceivable, were it not so evident. I answer him thus. Granted. I am willing to grant all that you ask— every thing—in yourown language, too, if you please A thing must have been, before it could be remembered. Yes. And if foreknown, it must be! Yes. That is enough. We care not, whether foreknowledge and freedom be, or be not irreconcileable. It is enough for us, that, for some reason, no matter what, whether by the constitution of things, or not---or, whether, because it was foreknown or not---it is enough for us, that, whatever is foreknown, must take place. If it must take place, the agent is not free. Yes, I repeat it, you are all wreng. Moral guilt does not consist in the determination of the will, or of the mind---nor, from whatever we may believe of our freedom---but, upon the fact whether we are free or not. It is, therefore, a begging of the question, petitio principii (that was to the clergyman--- the first part to Elizabeth) to maintain, that the guilt is in the will. The dispute is, whether man is free, or not. And you do no more than reiterate your own proposition....when you say, first, that man is free—and then, that the guilt is in the will. It is precisely like saying, that the doctrine is dangerous....for, that is supposing it false. If true, it cannot be dangerous; because, believe what we may, it can have no influence upon our actions. We are not free.” “I do not see it,” said the clergyman—“Dr. Reid was not so feeble, or blind a logician, as that—an identical proposition from Dr. Reid! Oh, no.—Pardon me!” “Let me put this question in another shape. I have a child, of a perverse, obstinate, disobedient temper, who is particularly fond of a particular kind of fruit. Willing to try him, I put him into a room, with some of the fruit; and command him not to touch it, or taste it. I leave him there. Now, one of your way of thinking, will say, that the child is free to obey, or not; and that, I may be able to determine, and to foreknow, almost to a certainty, whether he will obey, or not. Sir—hearken to me.—Exactly in proportion to my certainty, would be his want of freedom: and when I came to foreknow positively, as God is admitted to foreknow every thing, how he would behave in that room, he would be no longer free. You smile. Sir--- I do not wonder at it. I do not complain of you. You pity me---believe me, Sir---I am not deserving of it. If I am wrong, I am unworthy of compassion: for, I am wilfully and obstinately convinced, that I am right. However, to carry the thing one step further. Suppose that child to be so disobedient, that, it were enough to make him do any thing, only to have me command him not to do it. Suppose that the fruit in question, was a favourite kind---for which, he had been longing, for a great while, and had endured all risks, to obtain---and then, suppose that he were hungry, even to starvation. In that case, I should be morally certain of his disobedience, when I hadleft him in the room with the fruit. But, where would be his freedom?” “The child would be perfectly free, nevertheless--- perfectly free.” said the clergyman---“free to choose. “Ah!---then, if he be perfectly free, in this latter case, he must be more than perfectly free, in the former.” “I do not see that.” “The temptation is greater in the last case---is it not? Ah---you do not like to answer. Is it,--or is it not?” “It is.” “Is temptation an influence?” “Certainly---I cannot deny that. Make what use you can of it.” “Then, sir, if he be perfectly free, with a given quantity of temptation, or influence—he must be more than free, when the influence or temptation is diminished.” “Well but—I do not—I beg your pardon, sir. You are too fast---I—.” “Allow me, sir, if you please---for a single moment. Now, I do not contend---nor, is it necessary that I should contend, that my foreknowledge or prescience, in the case of the child, has any necessary influence on, or connection with, his conduct. I am willing to grant, if you please, all that Dr. Reid, or anybody can ask; that foreknowledge, of itself, has no influence at all (for the sake of argument, I mean) on the freedom of an agent. But, all that I contend for, is, that, exactly in proportion to the certainty of my knowledge, or prescience; or that of any being, whatever, of any event, or in relation to any event, or the action of any agent; that, just in that proportion, is the necessity that that event should happen; and that agent act, no matter for what reason. I care not why it must happen---it is enough for me, that it must happen, in proportion, as it is certainly foreknown.” “Well. God foreknows every thing, certainly, absolutely, and without qualification.” VOL. II. U “Consequently, all that he foreknew, or foreknows, must happen, as he foreknew, or foreknows it: just as the child must eat the fruit, in the case mentioned, if I, or any body, man or Deity, foreknew certainly, that he would eat it.” “Therefore, sir, do I repeat, that the determination of the will is not, even when it takes place, apart from all visible influence, but in mere rebellion, and downright disobedience to God, as it may appear, not only to us---but, to the man himself, who rebels, and is disobedient—is not the measure of moral guilt.” “And yet sir---mark me. If Dr. Reid were this moment arraigned before the Judge of all the world; and condemned, for some deed, done in the body---done, too, while he believed, that he was free to choose and determine---what would he say, if he found, then, that he never had been free? Would he not, if he had the power, remonstrate? Would he not say---“Spare me, O, God, spare me! I was under a delusion....I was deceived....I thought that I was free....yet, now, I know that I was not...that I was ever, in my will, determined by another power....even by thee, O, God! for, from thee, cometh all influence....all attraction....wilt thou punish me, O, my Father! that I was unable to fathom thy mystery. Lo, my brother is standing at my side....Upon the earth, he dipt his hands into the heart of his own children....even as thy servant, of yore, was called upon, to do....he believed that he was commissiones to do this....behold him, trembling, before thee....he was deceived. Shall he be punished?” “This may be eloquence; nay, it is eloquence, Mr. Hammond,” said Elizabeth, “but it is not argument. The poor creature believed that he was doing right; but we are speaking of those, who believe that they are doing wrong!” “I confess it,” answered Hammond, turning a little pale. “Yet, yet! I pray you, bear with me: if it should prove, at the great day of account, that he who had done some terrible crime upon this earth, wilfully, and intending to do wrong; and believing that he was at liberty to do it, or not; if he should find, at last, that he was under a delusion; that he was not at liberty to forbear; and that he could not have done otherwise; would he submit patiently, to his punishment. I care not who, or what he is. I dare to say no. I dare to say that Jehovah, himself, will not, cannot punish the man, unless he was free. You tremble---I do not. I have confidence in God's attributes. I believe that he cannot be unjust.” “Then God himself, is not free,” said Elizabeth. “Hammond stopped, confounded, overwhelmed--- but, it was only for a moment. “Yes,” he added, “God is free; and may do what he will. I retract what I said. Do what he may, though it be contrary to all our notions of right and wrong; yet it must be right, in him. Still, do I believe, though I do not tremble, that whatever is, is right; and that He will have mercy upon all that he hath fashioned.” “But what confidence can you have in this opinion? unless God himself, be subject to some immutable law, of his own nature; and if he be,” she continued. “And if he be!” answered Hammond, standing upright, like one suddenly struck blind; but he soon recovered himself. “If he be! that law is God! no matter what that law is; no matter how it operates; if there be any law, which compets the Being, whom we call God---to any mode of action; pay which influences him, in the smallest degree; though it be in his own nature”—he faltered, his brow wrought intently in its darkness---his great blood-shot eyes waned---his lips moved, but no sound came from them. “Now!” cried Elizabeth; “now! Mr. Hammond do I see you where I have been hoping to see you—in the deep ocean--the deep, deep ocean of God's nature---now is it that I see your reason totter! your,ajestick nature struck with darkness, abashed and shaking in the contemplation of it. O, Albert!” (the tears filled her eyes, and she stopped.) “I know not,” said Hammond, in an humbler tone, “I know not what this feeling may mean. I have thought many a weary year upon the subject--- wrestled with strong men---written, and talked upon it---but never; no, never, till this moment, have I felt its frightful incomprehensibleness. I can believe yet---I do believe it--that I am not free; yet, I will act so, if I can, so that, if it should prove at last, that I am free, or have been free, I shall be on the safe side. Yet, what confidence can I have in the mercy, or benevolence of God, unless I believe that his nature is, of necessity, benevolent and merciful:---and, having gone thus far, I establish a necessity superiour to him. Well, be it so---I will not---I never did, and I never will shrink from any conclusion, however appalling, to which my reason hath conducted me. The highest principle then; the God of all-nature---is Benevolence. Whatever that God does, we have agreed to call by the highest, best of names. To that God, necessarily omnipotent, omniscient, and all-merciful, I, from this hour, devote myself, and all my faculties.” “You have arrived then,” said Elizabeth, locking her hands, fervently, and lifting up her beautiful eyes to heaven; “you have arrived at wisdom and consolation; that wisdom, which will be very dear and profitable to you; that consolation, which will be with you, a present helper through all tribulation and trial; the hour of death and the day of judgment.” Hammond looked, as if he could have fallen at her feet, and buried his mouth in the dust. The sweat stood upon his white lips---his hands were violently agitated, for some moments, as he vainly attempted to reply, while the clergyman sat, with shining eyes, and mouth open, in mute admiration of her passionate enthusiasm. “Elizabeth,” said Hammond, after a few minutes of deep, unbroken silence, “I cannot deceive you. I have had leisure to think. My spirit has been above, in the presence-chamber of our Father, since I heard your voice; and stood there, with her face covered, and---and---this---this hath been written upon her forehead. There is one Lord God of Heaven and Earth; and but one! Whatever he does, he does, by no law; no influence; no necessity; but, by the free operation of his own will. Our confidence, in his mercy and benignity, and power, is not deducible from any fixed law of his nature, but from our experience and reason. Whatever he does, or suffers, or permits, or authorizes, is not only right, and wise; but wisest, most right, best. He has entirely surrounded us by innumerable influences and attractions; subjected us to the accidents of education; the contingencies of material things; the operation of spiritual things; filled us with passions, and appetites; and subjected them all to temptation and trial. Whether we be free at all, it is impossible to determine. Our reason declares that we are not so; our feeling that we are. In what degree, we are free, we shall never know. But that we are not entirely free, is as certain, as that entire freedom must be a power incapable of being influenced; agitated or attracted; subject to no passion, appetite, or law; inaccessable to temptation or trial, whether of earth or heaven, material or immaterial---and —nay, more, I cannot admit any thing like degrees of freedom. There may be degrees of slavery. To be free—or right—at all--is to be wholly free, and wholly right, and—.” “Pray, no more, now. I hear a step.” “The door opened, and Mr. Larence entered; a young man who had long been a devout admirer of Elizabeth. (She gave him her hand, at one, unaffectedly.) “Really! Mr. Larence,” said she, “I am very glad to see you. He threw up his dim sunken eyes, to hers-- and attempted to speak.” “I—(a slight, tremulous movement of his chin followed.) “I hope that your long absence has been of service to you—(she faltered)—to your health.” “Miss Adams,” he replied, while his handsome, melancholy features lighted up, for a moment, with an expression of intense feeling. “I---I—I thank you---- I cannot flatter myself, that it has been. My long absence---has not cured me.” “He laid a deep emphasis upon the words long, and me;--and Elizabeth, concealing some emotion, smiled faintly, as if she considered it in the light of pleasantry; but he did not; he grew more serious—and the vol. ii. U 2 conversation became more and more distrustful, timid, and reluctant. All have felt a strange unwillingness, to begin a conversation, during a dead silence. It is like beginning a letter; or a speech; a thousand times more difficult, than—(ending it, I was about to say, but that, I know by experience, to be yet more difficult) than continuing it, then, I will say. You cannot trifle at first—every eye is upon you; every ear open; and it is the devil to be serious, at the onset—when every body is listening to you. This Mr. Larence was a slender, interesting young man; one of the most interesting, that I ever saw—and, absolutely, the most elegant—who, if ever a man was devoted to a woman, was devoted to my sister, heart and soul. His family, talent, reputation, and character, to all the world, but her and me, were unexceptionable; to her, I know not for what reason—he was a great favourite with the women; and what is really unaccountable, he deserved to be—and to me, only, they were not, because I could not bear to think of sharing her heart; the heart even of my sister; with any human being; still less, of giving it up so utterly, as I must, to such a man as George Larence, if he once got possession of it. But for that, I never saw a man, to whom I would so readily have entrusted the happiness of Elizabeth. He was patient under trial; dignified—pious; and truly meek, and lowly of heart: unpretending; but gifted with a blessed, and bright intellect; a pure heart, and a romantick, lordly sense of honour, without show or parade; never talking for effect; never aiming to astonish; but winning all hearts, by the gentleness of his deportment; and the sweet, mournful tenderness of his genius. A creature, however, with all his meekness, not to be mocked at, or touched upon, with impunity. Let me give you an example, that just occurred to me: I sat by him once, when a ruffian was awed and confounded, so completely, by the collectedness of his manner; the evenness of his clear look, that he trembled from head to foot. Nay, I have seen him bear much; but I never saw any other symptoms of passion, than a high hearted heaving of the chest; and a little more brightness than usual, in his melancholy eyes. I remember, that he had once been challenged, for some hasty thing that he had said; and that he had the greatness of heart to go to the same place; and apologise for the affront, before the same company, for what he had done. I asked him why! But let me tell you all about it. “Because I was wrong,” said he, mildly; “and the man was rather smaller than I—” Yet while he was there, with every eye upon his pale, placid features, he was goaded to such desperation, by a professed duellist, in consequence of the apology, that he turned round to him, before the whole company, and rebuked him, as with the authority of a superiour being, for the blood that he had spilt. The other raised his arm. “Do not strike me. Frederick Harding;” said he--- “it would be unmanly, (his dark sunken eyes, were so full of severity, and steadiness---so undisturbed; so beautiful, that the other's arm dropped powerless before it—and he continued.) “You see that I am unable to resist your bodily force; that I am, in a measure, helpless, and defenceless; this you can see; do not strike me. The disgrace would recoil upon yourself. You have not a brave heart, Mr. Harding— but it is the desperate heart of an assassin---a murderer. You have that constitutional fearlessness of death; that regardlessness of God, which would have made you, what the world calls a hero; but which, by being shown in the commoner affairs of life—has made you only a murderer—nay, nay, do not threaten me—I do believe that you are a coward. Well! threaten me. I am not to be intimidated. A truly brave man, Frederick Harding, would never bully a smaller one, in company; and before women. Nay—nor tremble before him, as you do, at this moment, before me. Now strike me, if you dare! Strike me, sir—strike me, if you can,” he added—(for the women had fled from the room—stepping up to him, with his eyes flashing fire, and trembling with emotion)--- “strike me, if you have the manhood. What! a pistol---level it, if you dare!---fire it! You dare not. O, what a reptile! Gentlemen, look at this man. Behold him there—the terrour of the town:—one that had ridden over your hearts; the best and bravest--- trampled all the courtesies of life into the dust; bullying his way through society—dripping with the blood of one of the best men, that ever trod this earth! Behold him!---going armed into the assembly of women—insulting me—a man, of half his weight: and why? because he knew me to be principled against duelling; and because he had just heard me offer an apology to one, that I had injured; and because he believed me to be a coward! I, a coward; when he--- the dastard; hath not the strength to lift his hand. Begone!—sir!---leave the room, this instant;---or I will cowhide you upon the spot.” Saying this, he pressed upon the fellow; who, black in the face, with passion, and frothing at the lips, cocked the pistol, which till then had remained uncocked, with a shaking hand; and levelled it. “Another step,” said he, menacing, inarticulately--- I was thunderstruck at what I thought the rashness of Larence; and sprang forward to arrest the shot; but the pistol was already struck from his hand---the room rang; and the ball rattled along the wall, and through the window. Larence stood at the door, unharmed; and the discomfited wretch, overcome with his sense of inferiority, and shame, walked sullenly away. While we were yet pressing about the heroick Larence, who stood, with his fine eyes running over in thankfulness to heaven; and so weak, that he could hardly stand; another young man entered, and handed a note to him. Larence instantly recovered himself; stood upright, with a calm forehead, and untroubled mouth. Why could not I have done the same? I know not, but I could not---I never could---my heart would have burst, while his only bled, in such a silence---but Larence was a hero---I was not---I was only a man; a man!---I was less than a man. He read it through. “Do you know the contents of that scrawl, young man?” said he. The other bowed haughtily. “It is a challenge, gentlemen, said Larence,” handing a dirty paper to me--“and the fellow cannot write English---nor spell; he begins every word with a capital; and writes up hill---poh, poh! (he added, glancing with a pleasant look upon the bearer;) don't put on any of these airs here, sir---you are a young man.” But the other persisted. “Look you,” said I, “my lad”--stepping up to him, with half a mind to pitch him out of the window; but Larence rebuked me---walked composedly before me; and stood tearing up the note, leisurely, while he added, in a cheerful, but determined tone— “You are young, sir; I pity you---I would not hurt your feeling; but I shall take care, that you, as well as the scoundrel who sent you, are properly punished for this frolick. Nay, don't approach me. You do not know, perhaps, whom you have to deal with. I said before, that I pitied you;—if you do not go soon, I shall despise you; and, probably, make you despise yourself. The coward that sent you, I do not fear; if he attack me, I shall know how to defend myself --but I shall put both of you into safe keeping, directly.--- Stand by, sir! and let me pass: you had better stand a little aside; for so sure as you are a living man—or boy, rather; if I am once provoked, I shall give you a lesson for your impudence, that will not be very palatable.” Saying this, he attempted a third time, to force his way out; but the other put his hand upon his collar. Larence gently displaced it, with one of his; and threw the torn paper into his face, with the other. That was going too far; and the stranger darted a blow, quicker than lightning, at his face. Whether Larence received it, or not—I cannot tell: he certainly did not return it; and yet there was the sudden noise of a blow; as if a bone had been broken— and the stranger's arm dropped powerless at his side; and his youthful forehead contracted in agony. I looked at him in amazement: he turned deathly pale, and staggered against the wall; attempting, again, and again, to raise his arm; but it refused obedience to his will, and hung, as if dislocated. I was afraid of some evil to Larence, who walked leisurely and silently away, after throwing a compassionate glance upon the handsome young stranger; and I followed him; we had never been well acquainted till then; but from that hour, we became intimate, and continued so, till, I never knew for what, he became unaccountably dejected; avoided our house; and went to the Indies. Reader, there is a part of my life, that I cannot, cannot, bear to dwell on. If some suspicion should obtrude itself upon you, pass it over—in charity, if you can—in pity, if you have the heart. During that period, it was, that Larence had left America. I was glad to see him return; yet sorrowful on his account; for, after a few minutes, I saw that Elizabeth was under a painful restraint in his presence; that she wished to soothe his noble spirit, but dared not, lest it should give him encouragement, where it was not meant. Her manner grew colder and colder, in spite of herself; and his, more troubled and dejected; till at last, unable to endure it any longer, he arose. “Miss Adams,” said he, firmly; and then he spoke more faintly—the words were scarcely intelligible; but it appeared to me, that they were something like these, “I see that I have no hope;” and then, in a louder tone; he added, bowing low “ten thousand miles; three whole years have I passed, merely that I might see you once more—alone, if it were possible—entirely alone. Will you permit me an opportunity? Do not refuse me—can I see you to night—tomorrow— the next day—for a single moment? I hope that I am not presumptuous—forgive me, for my importunity--- no, no, dearest of women, I cannot leave you; will not, though forty thousand strangers were near you, till--” Elizabeth, as I could see, (being the nearest to her) had been motioning to him, pale as a spectre, to beware. I knew her motive; she was unlike other women. She would not lure her victim to absolute humiliation, where there was no hope; and she arose, agitated nearly to death---took his hand---firmly persuaded, I am sure, that nothing less could prevent him from exposing his fine heart to the world. “Yes, my friend,” said she “I will see you, alone; and immediately. I know your intention. I know the purport of what you would tell me. (This, she attempted to say, in a tone of pleasantry; but her eye filled, and her red lip quivered and swelled.) “Brother, you will be so kind as to entertain our other friends, till I return. I shall walk with Mr. Larence to see Emma Larence. Ah brother! you colour! I see that you would like to be one of the party; but it won't do to-night---farewell—”. Reader, I must stop---it is the first time that I have written her name---my hand shakes---I---I---farewell---</field>

This Emma---I can avoid it no longer---merciful God! how it effects me! the chord, once touched, will thrill---I feel it, I know it,—I foresaw it, from the beginning for ever and ever; well, well, I must learn to bear it---the more penetrating the sound, the sooner I shall learn to—God of heaven! it is too much--- I cannot go on-- I cannot—* * * * * * * * * * * * * * Let me try again. This Emma Larence was the sister of George Larence, of whom I have just—reader pardon me—there is no affectation in this—no trick. I have been abroad, in the cold open air, since I threw down my pen; and, I thought, when I returned, that I could take it up again, with a stout heart, and a steady hand, a—how strange it is! The tumult—the sickness, like death—the suffocation have gone by—a few minutes only have passed; and I feel as if I were in a pleasant dream; and yet there is a sense of soreness all over me, as if, somewhere, I had been suddenly thrown down by a strong hand; or shipwrecked, in a high wind; and drifted ashore, upon some desolate blossoming islet. There is a low, continual murmuring musick all about me; the tall beautiful grass and clear water are full of it—there is—I cannot well describe it—whenever I shut my eyes, a near, sweet, passionate vibration of the very air that I breathe— so that my lungs tremble, as I inhale it—as if I breathed an atmosphere of harmony. There is a feeling too, that--I cannot describe it, it is impossible —a sense of brightness and dizzy, suffocating beauty, that—well, well. Ah! where am I—what have I been doing. Friends! pardon me; I will try again— have compassion upon me. I will be less incoherent, * * * * * * * * * * This Emma was the sister of George Larence, of whom I have just spoken. It was Emma that I mentioned some chapters ago; as having seen her with her white, graceful neck glittering in the sun, once, when Hammond and I were walking together. She was leaning out of the window, if you recollect, to fasten back the blinds. It was the night when Hammond was stabbed; have you forgotten it? I became acquainted with her, immediately after that affair; and I should have mentioned it, step by step, but I dared not. Indeed I could not; it was impossible. I have hurried over a large part of my eventful life; I have crowded together incidents and adventures that happened years, nay, many years apart. I have omitted many things; and written, at times, with a vehement and distracted eagerness, about other people; but all to no purpose. It will not do. I cannot keep the secret. I must tell it—I must—if it be only that I may lay down, with an exhausted heart, when I have done; and cover my face for the last time, and give up the ghost, quietly. Would that I could stop where I am! Would that I could lock my poor hands, even here! and fall asleep for the last time, over the torn and wet record of my sorrow and transgression! But no! no! it cannot be. The trial is appointed to me—my destiny must be fulfilled; and then, I may be able—O, reader, join thou thy prayer with mine; for, wherever I am when thou art reading this—dead or alive—it may not be too late—that I may be able to look an angel on the face. Pray with me, reader! While you are reading this, I am a dead man—pray with me! it is not too late—pray with me, that I may be forgiven. It will do you some good, though it do me none---pray with me! O, pray with me! But let me recover myself; let me be more of a man. I will! Hearken to me, then, that you may understand thoroughly, the waywardness, and savageness of my nature; for you know enough of my tenderness, cowardice and warmth. I have dreaded to approach this vol. ii. W part of my life; but the story would be too imperfect, without it; and my design, from the beginning, was to tell it; and I never abandon a design, good or evil, that I have once formed. The delay; and all that I have hitherto related, have been only a system of preparation for myself; and even yet, I do not feel so fully prepared as I ought to be; but, nevertheless, the time has come now, and I will tell it. As I approach the days of our love, however, the love of Emma and me, I feel my heart, as it were, darkened; and a gentle stirring within the very centre of it, just as if the little nestling images of my children that I have kept there, and will keep there, through all eternity, if God will let me, were moving in it, with every breath that I drew. And my wife too! O Emma! Emma! why was I not known to the! why, thou blessed one, at the mention of whose name—nay, at the sight of it, written, by the hand of a stranger, my very heart stops, all at once; and instantly, all the shadowy void of my past life, clears up behind me, and swarms with the apparition of beautiful children---whose children, love? Thine and mine! Yea, Emma! Thine and mine! Thy sweet baby, the first blossom of our love--- the delicate miniature transparency of thyself, and thy purity---and the brave boy that followed her, to the green nest in the churchyard—O Emma! why was I not known to thee! Ah my wife! my wife!---Anna, the loveliest babe, that ever opened her violet eyes, upon the white bosom of a mother---and thou too, Liester!—O, who would abide a separation so terrible---a survivership so desolate--- were it not that---no Emma! no---I never will sully thy purity, by a thought like that!—thou hast been, thou art, faithful to me—but---O, love, had thy affectionate nature been but a little more resolute---had all my prayer and fondness done but a little more for thee--- or hadst thou been a little less mysterious, and silent, in thy love —but, no---no---I will not tell it, yet. I will put off the evil day---till all my affairs are settled with the world;---and then, if it please God, having told my sorrow, I will lie down, I care not where, as near her grave, and the green bed of my little ones, as I possibly can—and die. Poor, dear Liester!---I might have known, that I was about to lose thee— thy clinging affection as we parted;---so many times, the dear little fellow called me back, and kissed---and kissed me, till his little lips were fevered with the repetition;---and thou too, my babe---dear little Anna---so patient---when thy mother wept, at thy petulance---to see thy little hand wiping away her tears; and thy red mouth—O, my babe! my babe!—yes, yes---- and thy last low murmuring in our ears---“Good night, father!---good by'e cousin---good by'e,”—and then, while thy blue eyes were yet shining with life and beauty; and thy pale forehead was yet damp, damp as death---suddenly struck to marble---death struck--- I—I---Oh, Maker of men!—have pity upon the sorrowing of a father Thursday Night. I have been abroad all day. I am afraid to look back, on what I have written. There is a confused dreaming in my head, as of musick and pretty children, ---but, it may be that I have been writing of my own--- of my Anna, and of Leister; and of my beloved Emma. Stop!---I will be more firm---more of a man---the place of tears, the fountain of tenderness, hath been broken up. I feel easier now. When Anna died, it was a terrible blow to me; and I cannot look back on my feeling, now, without horrour. So little concerned was I,---so little apprehensive of calamity---there---there where I was so happy, that I had well nigh forgotten my God. While her little arms were about my neck; and her innocent warm lips put against my cheek---that---that---I had but a few hours for preparation; and, even to the last; the very last---till the flower turned black, all at once, upon the stem---and rotted in my sight—there was hope, even to distraction!—How I bore it, heaven only knows---all was darkness, for awhile---then incessant flashes of fire, breaking out, here and there, for a little time---till I came sufficiently to myself, to find my own dear, dear Emma. O, had she loved me, as I loved her!---sitting patiently by my side, with Liester in her arms---her pale lips riffled of their colour; and her clear temples stained all over with the blue meandering of her life-blood---as if she had thinned away, in her sorrow, till her heart and all its doings were to be seen, visibly,---as through a transparency. And then Leister went---and---though I knew it not---for I was away— away among the barbarians; leaving her—Oh, heaven, and earth!—how was I able to do it!—to die alone, and away from me—O Emma!— * * * * Lord! Lord!—it is impossible---I must leave it awhile —my keeper is at hand—I hear his tread I have spoken before of my fear of death. It was a part of my blood, I believe. About this time, when I had most reason to love life, it was at the height. Think what I suffered! No human creature would believe me, were I to tell him the frightful, and everlasting apprehension, that used to crowd in upon me, whenever I was left alone;—and, particularly, at night. It were enough to drive any man, I care not how great, or how good---he might be—raving distracted. I wonder how I bore it. I have often thought that no other man that ever lived, could have outlived bodily, to say nothing of his faculties being destroyed by it ---the strange, dark, perplexing, indefinite horrour that continually troubled me, like a cold wet atmosphere, and an eternal shadow; as if all that was beautiful and bright in heaven and earth---the stars, and the cherubim —Jehovah and his angels---were all in eclipse to me. O, it cannot be described. It haunted me, day and night. I slept, but to dream of death; and I awoke, but to shake at the thought of it; with a continual inroad of darkness upon me---and this too, unaccountable that it was! while I was the first, and foremost, in every headlong and perilous adventure. Sunday Morning. We were sitting together, Elizabeth and I, the next evening after that mentioned in the last chapter. Bear with me, reader, I will bring thee, soon enough now, to the end of my sorrowing. She was uncommonly serious. “Elizabeth,” said I---“when does George go away again?” “Immediately, I believe,” was her reply; and she turned away her face. “No other woman,” I continued; “no other woman, upon the earth, would have had the same forbearance and delicacy.” “Brother!”—said Elizabeth---her lips trembling as she turned to me—“Brother! I will not affect to misunderstand you. I know well your meaning. But you are mistaken. Many, and many a woman would have done the same thing.” “Many a woman!” said I, bitterly---“Many a one!--- there is not that one living, except my sister, who would not rather hear the tale of love; though she knew, in her own heart, that she ought not to listen to it; and could not reward it---though it came with the melody of death; from the heart that uttered it--- than—” “Stop, my brother---stop, I beseech you---there are many---Emma—ah!---you are willing to make one exception, I see!—you are a true Mosleman; a Mahommed; none have souls but your sister and your beloved!” “Brother!”— I turned, alarmed at the sudden alteration of the tone— it was a faint cry—“what ails you, Elizabeth?” said I. “Tell me—I cannot believe it,” was her reply—“and yet I cannot believe it altogether invention. Did you ever say that you could seduce any woman in the world.” “I never said so”—said I, laughing. “William!—Brother!—for mercy sake—do not trifle, now. Have you ever thought so?—what is your opinion of women? what have you said?” “No—I never have thought so. My opinion, you know. The more that I know of women, the more I venerate some; the more I despise the many. But, I do not despise them for their frailty;—not for that, VOL. II. W 2 which women despise themselves for; for that is often the effect of art and villany, which none could resist— of a secret influence and passion, that God meant to to be nearly irresistible.” “What mean you, brother?” You blush, Elizabeth. Let me deal plainly with you. Do you believe that any woman would ever submit to the pangs of child-birth; the agony of a mother; her anxiety, slavery and watchfulness; never sleeping, but at distracted intervals; and for ever wretched in her passionate care of her offspring; unless there were within her, a constantly operating attraction toward man, which God meant to be irresistible—or nearly so. No, Elizabeth; it is in vain that you would conceal it. You have passions like men—stronger indeed; or you are dealt partially with; for your suffering is altogether more severe than ours—and there must be something to compensate you. Well! You have hearts like us--- all that your education does for you, by that restraint, which makes you so attractive, sensitive, and amiable, is to multiply your danger a thousand fold. Give a woman any excuse for tenderness—any—I care not what—let her find something to love, lawfully, something, I care not what---for the love of which, she need not be ashamed, and will not be reproached—and see how she will dote on it; a doll; a flower; a bird; a kitten; a parrot; a lover; a husband; or a child. This it is —which you call the harlotry of the heart, when not sanctified by a certain ceremony—as if that, which is wrong in itself—could be made right, by a few idle words.” “Speak more plainly, brother—do you allude to the ceremony of marriage? Call you that idle?” “I do. Who married Adam and Eve? Who made it a religious ceremony? See the variety; the foolish tricks, that are played off, in different nations, by way of legalizing the natural expression of love. Here, they shake hands,—there, they say prayers. Here, the bride is taken away by violence;—there, she creeps into the bed of the man, and crouches at his feet, like a whipped spaniel. Why then, if a nation; a people; or a family may establish a ceremony of marriage, for themselves, why may not a single pair?” “They may,” said Elizabeth—“but the law must compel them to fulfil their duties of the condition; or, what confidence can they have in each other? What motive to indulgence; forbearance---or forgiveness? Who should educate their children? What would become of the next generation?” “There, dear---there!---You have taken the strong ground. But are you of those, who believe that the love of a man perisheth after possession?” “Can it be denied! are you not all—all—more sensual than we? Do ye not; has it not grown into a proverb, that the seducer will fly from his victim, if he can.” “And so, you would bind him by marriage!” “Yes.”— “My dear sister!---would that be the doctrine of a delicate woman? If satiety follow enjoyment, would a woman consent to hold the man, by law---whom, but for the law, she could not hold? Would not his caresses and endearment be a thousand times more affecting, while she knew that they were voluntary---while she knew that he was free---than while she knew that he could not, legally, refuse to caress her. But you are mistaken---satiety does not follow enjoyment. They, who love purely, love the more, after enjoyment. It is a more secret, inward, quiet and absorbing love. There is no loathing; no satiety, where there is no guilt---except there be a great folly, or great brutality.” “I can believe you—brother. You must be right— else no delicate woman would ever marry—nor ever yield, for a moment, to that passion, which is the mysterious law of her nature. But what did you say of women? Let us return to that subject.” “I said this—that a man may do anything within the limits of possibility,—that, therefore, he might, by fraud or force; by intrigue; or love; in some way or other, if he would persevere steadily, year after year, gain possession of any woman, that ever lived. By this, I do not mean that he could seduce her; still less; do I mean that he could corrupt her heart—but that he could prostrate her; and imprison her, as he would a man—and hold her at his mercy.” “For shame, my brother—You do not know other women, as you know us; no other, indeed—how then can you judge of them, so scornfully!” “I!--what, when I have seen them seduced, almost without excuse---or persuasion---the proud of heart too---the pure and intellectual:--comforted, when they had become mothers and wives, in their utmost bereavement, and distraction, by baubles, that I would not give to children; —distressed, helpless, and broken hearted, motherless and childless women—and husbandless women—in the summer time of their affection, quieted by ribbons, and bonnets; dolls and sugar plumbs—a tea service—a new carriage, or a party.” “Hush! hush!—shame on you, caitiff—you are verily wandering in your allegiance. Take care if I report you—another banishment.” “Sister!” “Nay, nay brother—that flashing of the eyes won't do---what!---ah, pardon me brother, dear brother, I did not mean to trifle with your feeling---do forgive me, do!” What could I say? I was cut to the heart---Emma had banished me once, since our love had begun; and the interval that wore away, before our reconciliation, was disconsolate and sorrowful, to both of us, I do believe, beyond all that woman could imagine. To me, it was like the parting of the grave. I had no preparation for it; there was no opportunity for me to put my lips upon her forehead, reverentially, as I was wont; ---to weep upon her hands; and hear the reverberation of her heart, to my farewell---O, no---but, it was like the parting of the sick chamber---the death bed. For two or three days, she had been sad; and there was a visible constraint in her lovingness; my pride awoke--- my jealousy of power---for, I would not share the heart of the woman that I love, even with my Maker. Reader, you start---I do not wonder at it. Yet, it is true; and, I cannot disguise it. Wholly God's - or, wholly mine---must be the woman of my heart, That must be the most acceptable worship, where woman fulfils her destiny; and loves her husband, with all her heart and soul; that the truest religion! Not that I would have her love her husband, more than the laws of God---No! but, I would have her heart; her affections; her tenderness, altogether, and unqualifiedly, her husband's. In that way, would she best show her love for God. For two or three days, there had been a growing concern, in her blessed countenance; and, at last, she sat by me, and sang to me, in her own sweet, painfully sweet, clear voice, the very song, that I first heard her sing--- “O, never doubt my love!” My heart fainted---thrilled. I looked up into her face. I saw her passionate eyes full of solemnity and pathos; her lips moving, as if in prayer. Man!—It was the last song that she sung to me;--the first, and the last. In the morning, at breakfast, we met again; our manner was yet stately; though, I do believe, that we had little apprehension in our hearts, of what was about to happen. I had met her; taken her hand; and seated her at the table; neither of us had spoken, except to give the usual salutation of the day. The silence was mournful; and, to me, so distressing, that I was fain to conceal my emotion, by waiting, sternly, the result. We parted. I saw her no more. For many a weary month, we never met again. We dreamt of each other; thought of each other; prayed for each other; but, I; alone, was able to speak. She was silent, and pale as death. She tried hard, to forget me; and flattered herself, for a time, that she had succeeded; but, I knew her nature, too well, for that. She was younger than I, and more sensitive; of course, she would feel more keenly. She had less experience than I; and, had never felt her heart stirring with vitality; at the touch of any hand, or sound of any voice, before mine. Of course, she would have no experience, to support her, under the fire, and sickness; and giddy, faint humiliation; nothing to put her upon her guard, against the inroad of sweet thought, and delirious dreaming. Add to this, that I was a man; mingling, every hour, with the incessant bustle, and clamour of life; never alone, and capable of turning all my faculties, immediately, into any channel, that I pleased. I knew this; I felt it; and, when she said farewell to me, I pitied her; blessed her, in my heart, and wept aloud; wept upon my knees—for I knew that, with all my faults, I was the only man on earth, to make her happy; and, the only one, whom she could ever love. I said so; but, who could believe me? I even went further—for, I could not contemplate the desolation, and darkness, and stillness, that I foresaw, assembling about the sunshine and beauty of one, whom I had so loved, without quaking, inwardly. I was willing to lay down my life for her; nay, more; I was willing to bind my pride, and self-love, hand and foot; and lay them down at her feet. I did so. But—heaven lent her strength. She stood up; pale, but stout-hearted yet; and turned away her face to my prayer. How perversely we are constituted! From that hour, I swore, in my spirit, to win her, or die. I could have broken her heart; I could; it would have been an easy matter; for, she had loved me; but, I scorned to do it. What there was evil in my nature, had disappeared, at her approach. My temper lay, prostrate, before her. Many, and many a month passed away, in weariness and faintness; yet, I faltered not; and she—the blessed martyr! though her trials were ten thousand times more heavy than mine; operating too, in solitude—surrounded too, by ten thousand insensible things, to lacerate and weaken her, with fewer consolations; yet, the heroick girl withstood the whole pressure, till she was nigh to drop. Both had hours of bitterness and sorrow; but, both were proud: I waited to know that any advance would be acceptable. And she, with the sublime delicacy of woman, not only, would not permit herself, or any of her friends to make any advance; but, she would not even permit them to signify that, if I made any, it would be received. Thus went we, upon our way—I, sorrowing that we might not meet, alone, where I could tell her, face to face, that I still loved her; and should love her, to my latest breath; and she, it may be, sorrowing too, that she had not been less precipitate, in discharging her heart of its burthen; a little less sudden and peremptory, in dethroning the lord of her affection; and wishing that she had dictated other terms; such, as would have left her a prospect of happiness, with me, after many a year of self-denial, and virtue; and one, sure, sure hope of her love. We might have gone to our graves, with the same unpropitiating spirit, devoted, in truth and purity, to each other; yet, dying, with the heavy secret untold upon our lips. Thrice, however, had we been near meeting; once, when an accident had befallen her, and when, if I had seen her in the arms of another man, in the trance that she was, I should have thrust him from her; and never left her again, never! until she looked upon me again, as she had been used to look. And once, when she happened to enter a house, the moment after I had left it; when, if we had met, she must have forgiven me, though we parted anew, and for ever;—and last—O, I cannot tell how that happened. She was a catholick girl; and had once been near consecrating herself to perpetual sorrow; and well nigh becoming a nun; that most unprofitable of beings; one of them, whose whole life is spent in making barrenness a virtue. But at last, at last! blessed be heaven! we did meet, and were reconciled. Never had we loved so truly, and so devotedly; with that sublimity, which spiritualises the passion; taking away all its earthiness; and etherializing all its essence and issue. And now— now, while our hearts were just re-uniting, after a separation, like death; just knitting anew, the ruptured and bleeding filaments that had been torn away, so violently and suddenly, but, without having lost their sensibility, or their instinctive movement, for reunion, when they were brought near to each other; to be told, just then, when the blood was just beginning to ripple, again, through the united parts, of another banishment, another separation—Oh! it was driving the knife home, indeed! home, to the vitals! home, to the sundering of soul and body. I was unable to utter a word. I tried, but I could not—I could only, when Elizabeth threw herself upon my bosom---with her arms over my neck, sobbing, as if her dear heart would break---I could only say, “God bless you, dear---God bless you!” “Forgive me, dear William—speak to me, O, speak to me—or, if you will not—give me some token that I am forgiven.” I pressed her hand; and she kissed my forehead, and eyes, till I reeled with blindness. She had meant no harm—and I was ashamed of my unmanly sorrow; and yet, it was not sorrow; there was something rather of dismay, and consternation— nay, even of prophecy in it; for my heart was smitten, as with a leaden sceptre—and a voice came from my lips—unlike the sound of my own voice. My blood was chilled at the noise of it; as if a spirit had spoken these words within me. “Our second parting will be for ever. My second banishment, for all eternity.” Elizabeth shuddered, and looked round—and I— I shuddered too; but I was, like one constrained, and obliged to speak. She looked pale, and trembled; and, when she put her hands upon my face, she said; “my brother!—your voice sounded very strangely to me—I should not have known it.” I was unable to speak; and we sat, with my arm about her waist; and her head leaning upon my bosom, while I held her cold, delicate hands—both—in one of mine, to my heart, which beat, as if it would break its way through, to be embraced by them. “I wonder,” said I, at last—while her disordered hair swept over my eyes, and tickled my lips, until I was fain to push it aside, hastily; and the wind blew it, as I did so, all abroad, like a thick, brilliant vapour, behind us. “I wonder,” said I, “that you can have the heart, to persist in your resolution, dear, of never getting married.” “That is not true, William,” said she, putting her arm about my neck. “You do not wonder at it.” “I do, indeed;” I replied—a little maliciously, and with somewhat of the silly discontented feeling of those who love, but are never satisfied, unless they hear each other saying, all the time, Oh, I do love you—O, how I love you! “A woman like you, so fitted for the companionship of a high minded fellow; heroick; virtuous; ambitious.” “But where am I to find such a man?” “Where! Why there is---George Larence. Nay, nay, do not put your hands over my mouth—I will have it out.” “Upon my word, brother, you are getting scurrilous,” she replied, thrusting her beautiful hand through my hair, and tugging at it—“I shall not submit to it, I assure you.” “Then there is—” (I continued.) “Who!” said she, eagerly. “Who else is there, that you would—.” “Nobody!” said I, anticipating her question, while her hand fell into her lap. “Nobody else upon this earth!---not even to him!---would I consent, that—” “How,” answered Elizabeth---“is my brother so— vain of his sister; or so selfish?” “Vain, if you please, child; and very selfish, as all men are, of what is inestimable. Who is willing to share his only jewel—his last drop of cold water, while his lips are blackened with fever!---his wife---his child?” “Brother, brother!---that is wrong,” said Elizabeth, with a deep sigh. “I shall never be married.” “Her tone of voice went to my heart. It was utterly unlike her manner on such occasions. There was less of determination, than of grief, and despondency, and strange hopelessness in it. Nay, her breath grew thicker; and I thought that I felt a deeper throb at her heart, where it leaned upon mine. “But why,” said I; “my dear girl—why do I hear a tone so disconsolate (her head drooped)—from Elizabeth Adams, on such a subject. It is but looking about you, sister; and you may have your choice of the wisest, and best.” She raised her slender form, for a moment; put back the silken luxuriance of her hair; and smiled—such a smile, as I never before saw upon her beautiful mouth. “There are godlike creatures,” said she, with fervour; but, in a low tone, and with a working lip, as if vol. ii. X she were communing with her own heart—but---a tear fell upon my hand. “Then why do you not marry?” said I, overcome with my feeling. “Why refuse Wilman? Why, Larence? O, Elizabeth, I have been too selfish; I will yield you to them---to either---to any body.” “To anybody! brother.” “Yea, to anybody—you would not marry a man, that I could be ashamed of.” “Yes---but might I not choose some one, that you could not love?” “I hope not. I believe not—(her head fell upon my shoulder,) yet, nevertheless, dear, it were better that there should be some one to protect you, when I am away, or dead, or—” “Married—brother,” she said, half smiling, half pouting, while her voice trembled, like the melody of wet harp strings. “Would that I could see you married, after all, Elizabeth. I begin to be weary of this continual sacrifice---I—” “What sacrifice, brother?” “This, that you are making to me; this daily, hourly martyrdom; giving up your beauty, and dominion, to unprofitableness—(I felt her blood rush like a sudden tide through her temples, while they rested against my cheek)—were you married, though your heart, for a time, would feel widowed; yet a new being would bound in yours; new relations—I might live to see a babe, with blue eyes---(the blood rushed again through her whole frame---I could feel it in her throat, as if she were strangling with confusion, and shame; aye, even to her finger ends)—or black eyes; (her hand shook in mine)---and dimpling fat hands, nestling about the heart of my sister. What!—offended, sister!--- surely the thought cannot be new to you; a woman of your age, educated as you have been; qualified to fulfil every office of a wife, and a mother, with a surpassing tenderness, and simplicity---you cannot be offended, dear.” “No, brother, not offended,” (said Elizabeth, with a timid voice—) “not, offended, but sorrowful. I have few notions of prudery; very few, I believe. I am able to look, and speak, of the nursery, and of children; without stammering, or blushing. Nay, more. I have had a sweet dreaming, now and then---averse as I have always been, to the perils of matrimony—about children of my own---naked little creatures; beautiful as the day---innocent as beautiful; full of divinity; radiant all over with the infusion of our Father's love. Yes, brother! and I have had to hush my heart, with both hands, and all my strength---while I lay, and wept, at the thought. And then, too, toiling as I have been, all my life, for the improvement of my mind, and temper; fitted, as I know that I am, for domestick government; and capable, as I believe, that I am, like most women, to endure privation and sorrow; pain and agony, unspeakable, for the man that I loved, beyond all that men can ever experience, or imagine; to think of passing away an unprofitable life; having no one to love me, in my old age; no husband, and no child to be near to me, in calamity---to go down to my grave, a worthless; nameless; unhonoured woman;---because I have not been base enough to sell myself for some price, less than love; to some mercenary wretch, for an equipage---to some unnatural tyrant, for family distinction; to some fool, for his beauty; or to anybody, that I might escape the imputation of being an old maid; as if to be a virgin, were to be something shameful. When I have thought of these things, brother, I cannot deny that I have wept, wept, bitterly; and felt very heavy at the heart—yet, still—.” “You are determined, then,” said I, pressing her to my bosom; “never to be married! O, sister, how I venerate you. Yet do not think to impose upon me. I know your motive.” What shook her so? By heaven, she grew as white as a corpse. “Nay, you cannot deny it,” said I. “I will deny, nothing,” said she, firmly---“nothing, which is true. What I have already said, I would not have said to any other human being---if you know my motive.” “If!” said I---“if I know it---why, surely, my sweet Elizabeth cannot imagine, that her secret has been so well kept, for so many years.” “For so many years!”—said she, looking surprised. “No,” I continued---“no my sister. I feel, and acknowledge, the sublimity of your love---: why do you change colour? It is unheard of; and it were almost unnatural for me to marry, and leave a sister, that lives unmarried, for her love of me. No, Elizabeth, such heroick be—” The tears started into her eyes---“my brother,” said she, wringing my hands, and wetting them with her tears---“my brother! I cannot deceive you---I will not. Hear me---it must be told---I would not willingly give pain to you; but---I cannot endure to be praised for virtues, that are not mine—I—” I was perfectly silent. “I,” she continued—“I—it is not on your account, that I do not marry.” “On whose then?” said I, abruptly---on whose then?---fool that I am—I—” “Be calm, William,” she replied, with great dignity, and moderation. “Be calm, for a moment; and you shall hear; I will not keep the secret any longer. Your violence does not intimidate me; but it distresses me. Are you prepared?—it will come upon you like a thunderclap. It is on account of Albert Hammond, the Dwarf; that I do not marry.” “Righteous heaven!” I cried, as soon as I could get my breath. “O! say not so!—Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Elizabeth Adams! on my bended knees, I entreat you; —O, say not so! Let me not cast you off for ever—let me not curse you!” “Aye, my brother, curse me if you will—cast me off, for ever, if you will—yet will I repeat it—standing up as I do now—before Him, to whom we are all answerable—calling him to witness the truth—I do say it—I repeat it---I glory in it. Your unnatural hatred, and cruelty to him—Albert Hammond, the Dwarf—the man of power, have made me love him!” “Love him!—love Hammond!—My beautiful sister loving deformity, and death—O, God! O, God! Now, then, do I believe in sorcery!—now, in Shakspeare!— now do I believe, that when he drew women, till my heart sickened, and heaved, with loathing, and detestation; the unnatural and beastly appetite of Desdemona—that—” “Brother!” cried Elizabeth. “Brother! beware; you do not know me, if you believe, that I am tame enough for this. Look at me!” She stood up—her hair all loose—giving out her brightness, and beauty, like a halo about her—her eyes flashing with indignation; her lips quivering, and burning, with loftiness, determination, scorn, and purity. “I have a spirit, that will not be branded with sensuality, even by the most delicate insinuation—look at me—were all the beauty, of all the men of the whole earth, embodied in one man; and were he kneeling before me, I would set my foot upon his neck.” “And so would Desdemona;” I answered, through my shut teeth—“on all but one.” For the first time in all her life, there was a dash of wicked scorn and bitterness, in her beautiful face; and her eyes, too, streamed with passion. “Brother! brother! you have dishonoured your own sister! Now listen to her! Behold the work of your own hands!—hear the story of her shame—nay, cower not!—cover not your eyes! You shall see it, though I pluck away your hands by force.—Stop not your ears! I will ring it for ever there, till you acknowledge the greatness of Hammond; his forbearance; and your own ingratitude. Yea!—down to the earth with your forehead—there let it lie!—but you shall hear me—nevertheless, you shall!—though it never be lifted again.” “I love Albert Hammond—I have loved him, for years—and he knows it. I have done all but tell him of it;—for his sake I shall never marry; and for his, alone!” “Marry him!” said I—“marry him, in the devil's name!—and nurse the hellish imps, that will issue from his loins, till your own beauty be stained and tarnished, by the touch of their very lips, and breath. Marry vol. ii. X 2 him!—and may God's—O, no—Elizabeth, I cannot curse you—I cannot—I must bless you—though you have broken my heart.” That brought her to my bosom. “No, brother,” she answered, sobbing—“no! I shall never marry him— never.” I was really comforted with the declaration; but ashamed to appear so. “What!” I cried—“he won't marry you, I suppose; or he may love somebody else.” “I believe, that he does, madman,” she answered, rising; and burying her face in her hands—“I believe, that he does love another woman; for he has done all but tell me so. Nay, I believe more, that, if I threw myself into his arms, he would reject me.” “Damnation,” I cried, leaping upon my feet: “this is too bad!---refuse you!---reject you!---though I would rather see you dead ten thousand times, dead, and rotten, than in the arms of Albert Hammond, I would cut his heart out of his bosom—tear his tongueout by the roots; and make him eat it, if he dared to refuse you.” She smiled, bitterly; contemptuously, I believe. “You!” she cried—“you! Why, William, he could hold you still as death, with one hand; and bind you hand and foot, with the other. What a madman you are! So you would run to him, and cut his throat, for refusing to marry your sister. What a pretty figure, you would cut! No, brother—before you set out on such an errand, I will tell you the whole truth. I am not yet, utterly dead to maiden modesty; and have never told my love; nor sought his. Nay, more—would he offer to marry me, this hour, I would refuse.” “Refuse,” said I—“why!---why, if you love him; are you torturing me to death for pastime? Why would you not? Why? Why would you refuse?” She coloured to the very eyes, when she spoke, “Because,” said she—“I hold it to be sinful, to transmit disease, and deformity. I would neither marry, nor be given in marriage, to one, whom— You understand me, brother. Men are thoughtless—women are more so. They marry with broken constitutions; hereditary diseases; and unnatural, or vicious propensities; entailing, thereby, upon their innocent offspring, to the third and fourth generation—all that is loathsome, abhorrent, or disagreeable—thus fulfilling, literally, the denunciation, that heaven has pronounced upon them that sin; nay, I do not doubt, that these are the sentiments of Albert, himself. I say, that I do not doubt it: for, without seeking to know his thought upon this subject, I know enough of his mind; and turn of thinking, to feel very certain, that he is restrained from thinking of marriage; not with me, for I do not believe, that he loves me, but with another, and a far more beautiful woman, by the same considerations. I shall never marry him, brother, whatever may happen. And for the sake of him, I will never marry another. Will that satisfy you? Can you find any comfort in it?” What could I say? All my dreams were dashed to the earth, at once. What I most dreaded, yet never dared to think of, had now come to pass. Elizabeth loved Hammond—and so did I—but not, O heaven, no!—not as the husband of Elizabeth! the partner of her bed—the father of her babes!—O, no!—My blood curdled at the thought! But worse than this—; nay, not worse, but next to it, in bitterness, and shame, was the discovery that I had made; that her reason for not marrying, was not her love to me—but to another; and that other—O, my brain whirled at the thought—and I fell down giddy, and sick, upon the floor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. Emma...Atonement...Debate...Power of the states under the constitution...Bills of credit...Bank paper...State charters unconstitutional. I saw Emma the following night; and told her, by way of accounting for my stern and troubled look, all that I could, without betraying the secret of my sister, which concerned Hammond. Her mild eyes darkened; and her hand, as I held it, endeavouring, as usual, to keep my fingers upon the pulse, grew suddenly cold. I pressed it---it was passive---I was half angry. I looked up, and there was a suppressed agitation about her chaste mouth, as if her very heart were in labour. “Emma,” said I, as soon as I could speak; “you blame me, I feel that you do. What shall I say to you? Do you upbraid me?” “No, no,” she replied, “I cannot upbraid you, but —(she faltered) I am afraid that you do not fully know Mr. Hammond. He is exceedingly your friend; and, and—pray, if the difference be not irreconcilable —pray meet him, as a friend.” I pressed the hand of the dear pleader to my lips —“Emma!---I will. I will see him tomorrow; and---” (I did not say what I would do; but I determined to make an atonement equal to my offence.) She mistook me, and threw a look of alarm at me, as she saw me rise---“do not go, yet---not yet---it is not your hour.” Her sister sat opposite to her; and I would have given the world to be alone with her, for one moment; and even to part less abruptly; but I could not. I was impatient to retrieve my own good opinion; and my impatience, to all but Emma, looked like anger. “Good night, madam! good night; good night!” said I, to the whole family, in a less, cordial tone, I am sure, than usual, for I saw them recover themselves, with rather more steadiness than common; but when I came to Emma, I stopt; she put her hands into mine; and, as I stood, with my back to the family, I set my lips, fervently to her smooth, cold forehead, to which the blood leaped, as to a wound; and whispered, “good night!” That same evening, I went to Hammond's room, but he was away. I waited with impatience till morning; but, when I had taken my breakfast, he was already in court. I went there---spoke to him; gave him my hand; and he took it, much as usual; but---perhaps it was suspicion in me---I thought, with a movement of haughtiness about the mouth, that was not common. I sat down; and was not a little astonished soon after, when he addressed the court---at the profound attention with which he was listened to. His language was that, which I had always heard him recommend; precisely what he would have used in conversation; yet, with this difference, that he talked better in conversation; nay, I never heard him talk so badly, until he had fairly entered into the debate; and then, I was carried long with him, by his bold, distinct, vehement way, just as if he were in conversation. I am an excellent stenographer yet; but then, I was unrivalled; and, willing to pay him some compliment, (for I had heard him often say, that he wondered how he should argue in public; that he could not write, or study his language; that he felt a great concern upon the subject; and that he should not be able, for years, to enforce the same attention in court, that he did in conversation.)---I employed myself in taking notes of his speech. It was nearly as follows. After some discussion about the propriety of entering into the main question, at once; it was permitted to the counsel, to touch upon it. “The court have been informed that this is a motion, under rule, to shew cause upon a quo warranto. Without entering into a repetition of what has already been said, I shall proceed, in the shortest and plainest possible way, to reply to our antagonist; and enter at once, briefly, upon the merits of the great question, in support of the following propositions. 1. That no state of the union hath a right to incorporate a banking company, with authority to issue bank paper. 2. That all such incorporations; and all acts done in consequence thereof; and under the authority of the same, since the present constitution of the United States was adopted, are unconstitutional and void. 3. That this is the only legitimate mode of bringing the question before the court. The clause upon which I depend is this: art. 1. sec. 10. of the U. S. constitution—no state shall emit bills of credit. In the first place, it will not be disputed that the letter of this constitution, shall always yield to the spirit; and that, when about to be interpreted, the common rules of construction are to be regarded: the evil meant to be remedied; and the intention of them, that framed and adopted it. If these preliminaries are to be disputed, I must stop—for the constitution, which is not a code of laws, but a simple declaration of what are considered fundamental principles, will become a dead letter. What then was the evil to be provided against, by the new constitution? It was this—one that had blackened and dishonoured the reputation of the whole country; and had shaken the confederacy to its foundation. Some of the states had issued their paper money, till it was utterly worthless; thereby raising a revenue, too secret for our jealous forefathers; and taxing their neighbours in a manner too little likely to alarm them: and dishonouring the whole coalition by their breach of faith. Look at the constitution. You see, with what scrupulous sagacity the great men that wrought it out, have provided against an ascendency so dangerous. They will not permit any state, to keep armies or navies in time of peace, without the consent of congress. Why? Because two or three of the maritime states; and two or three of the inland ones would soon become armed rivals. Neither would they permit, to any state, the power of levying imposts. And why? Because that would give a direct, and constantly accumulating secret, encroaching ascendency to the importing states. It would endanger the equality; if not the safety, of the whole family. It would give them the power of taxing their inland brethren, at pleasure. But, at the same time, they do permit to each state, the power of direct, open taxation; because they know that such a power can never be dangerous, to a thoughtful and free people. The evil then, is clear. The purpose and intention of the framers were, of course, to prevent a repetition of it—to maintain the equality of the states—to prevent a secret, and dangerous, and constantly augmenting system of taxation; and, thereby, to keep down the worst propensity of their nature; their appetite for dominion. “But,” say our opponents—“these Bank bills are not Bills of credit—and are not emitted by the state.” What!—are we to quibble, upon such a point as that! What are Bills of credit? Are they not, any, and every kind of circulating paper medium? Qualify them, as you may, by one name and another; certificates—banknotes—bank bills—treasury notes—or what you please; all are Bills of credit. Because, they tend to obtain credit—and revenue; and, by their ultimate destruction, loss, or depreciation, to tax a people, in the most oppressive, though wasteful, and secret manner. But, we are told that, they are not emitted by the state!” That is false. They are emitted by the state. Qui facit per alia, facit per se—what is done by my authority, is done by myself. Is not a tax raised as securely, and as certainly?— first, by a bonus to the state, which is not paid by the people at first, for that would stir up their hot blood, to remonstrance—and, secondly, to the incorporation, by the people—which thereby enriches the state, a second time. Is there not the same danger of a breach of faith? the same likelihood that more paper would be issued, than could be redeemed? the same perilous ascendency of the larger, and more powerful members, to be guarded against?—as if the Bills of credit were issued, directly, from the state treasury. No. I am wrong—it is not the same!—it is ten thousand times greater. A state has some reputation; some sense of justice; which, in the vicissitudes of election, will appear at last; but Banking incorporations— I appeal to all our experience---are to be restrained in their issues, only by destruction or inability. But grant that each has the same desire, to inundate a country with bank paper---the state itself---and the incorporations established by the state. I would ask, which of them has the most power; the most activity; the greatest number of agents and partisans?---nay, the greater credit?—I answer, without hesitation, that the latter have. No state in the union, can issue, by her own direct authority, directly from her own treasury, so large an amount, of bank paper, as two or three great incorporations can, when excited by a spirit of rivalry. And why? Because the most ignorant man, among us, dreads to have his remedy against a sovereign state; he would prefer the note of many an individual, to the plighted honour of a whole state. In the first place, he has a short and certain remedy; against the state, a slow and uncertain one. But, be that as it may, there is yet a point, upon which the subject may be rested for ever. On that, I depend. It is maintained that a state, though she may not emit bills of credit, directly, from her own treasury, may give an authority, (which it is acknowledged, that she, herself does not possess) to others; whereby, they may do, in effect, what She cannot do, provided that they will change the name, from Bills of credit, to Bank bills, or bank notes. If this doctrine be sound, what will become of these provisions? “No state shall keep ships of war, in time of peace—without the consent of congress.” “No state shall coin money.” Suppose that a state authorize a company of individuals, to build and keep sloops of war—gun boats—fire ships—bomb ketches—(but not ships) in times of peace, without the consent of congress. Would it be right?— Would she have the power? There is no interference with the words of the constitution. The spirit only, is set at nought. Who has the hardihood to maintain that she may? Yet, the principle is the same. If a state may authorize an incorporation to issue paper money—she may authorize the same incorporation to build and keep, in time of peace, without the consent of congress, all sorts of warlike, naval armament, except ships of war; nay, even ships of war—if it be not an infringement of the constitution, to authorize another, to do, what she cannot do herself. So too, a state may constitute a privileged company of men; and authorize them to coin money—receiving a share of the profits in advance, under the name of bonus; and, when arraigned, put her hand, fearlessly upon the constitution; and say, that she has not dishonoured, nor contemned it; that she has not coined money: but only authorized others to coin money. Nay—what is this, but coining money?---Stepping, at once, into the throne of sovereignty; usurping, by proxy, the two of its chief attributes; the right of coining money, and that of raising a revenue? Yet, more---the evil is greater than that of coining money; for, in the latter case, the usurpation would be but of an unprofitable attribute. There is little or no profit, in coinng money. The general government, therefore, would lose much less by it....and the people, as there must be some intrinsick value in the coin, could not be utterly abused; or to such an extent, with money coined, by an incorporation; as by bills emitted. The former would always be worth something, for old metal. Thus far, have I argued closely, from the acknowledged principles of the constitution. It abounds with analogy. To that, I refer, without taking up the time of the court. A few words more, and I have done. It has been asked, why the states have been permitted, so long, to enjoy this power, unquestioned, if it be not a rightful one?—I have been thought rash and presumptuous, for daring to lift up my voice against such Vol. ii. Y venerable abuse. Call me rash—I care not. Say that I am presumptuous.—I have lived long enough, not to be afraid to speak the truth, any where; or, before any face; and long enough, to give me confidence, when I came here, in defiance of long usage; prescription; and consecrated abuse. I care nothing, for either. I know the duty of this court; and, I call upon them, to pronounce a judgment, according to their oaths and allegiance. I was about to leave the matter here—but, I see, on glancing at my notes, one or two objections, to which some answer, and mine shall be a very brief one— ought to be given. It is said, that any one man may, under our constitution, issue his note of hand; and then, it is asked, if one man may, why may not fifty; or one hundred; or a thousand? It is said, too, that he may issue that note, in just such shape, as he pleases; pictured and engraved, if he will, like bank paper; merely printed like a check; or written only, like a common promissory note—and that it is the folly of the publick, if they receive it as any thing more. To which I reply, first---It is the duty of all governments to protect the people from manifest injury, not only where they cannot, but where they will not protect themselves. In the next place, one man, or a dozen, or twenty, or a thousand, may sign a note of hand; I admit that; and put it abroad—but mark the consequence. He and they must all be liable, in person and property, for the redemption and payment of the note. There lies the secret. The legislature shall not interfere, and trample all the law of contract, into the dust, to protect any of them;—and so long as they are not protected, their issue is constitutional, because it is nothing more than a partnership note. But is that like Bank paper, issued under state authority? No—The legislature does interfere there; and grant to one party, protection and indemnity, against all law; and against all the principles of law; protecting the debtor, in person and property; nay, even in reputation: for it is no longer disgraceful to have been one of a swindling banking company—from all the consequences of his madness or folly. In the next place, I maintain that the United States, alone, have the right of issuing paper money: that even congress cannot give that power to any individual state, any more than it can, the right of coining money. The prohibition is peremptory. There is no chance of escape. It is not even left, as some things are, to possibility; or, as in the case of keeping ships of war, to the consent of congress. I go one step further. I say now, that, if the United States have any paper currency abroad; not an individual has a right to print or engrave his own simple note of hand, so as to resemble that currency. He has no right to coin money, so as to resemble the money of the state. But, he has still the right to coin money; and stamp it; and issue notes of hand, in any form he pleases, provided that, the unwary shall know, at a glance, that it is not the coinage, or issue of the state sovereignty. It is not enough that a minute inspection would discover the difference—the difference must be broad, and sufficiently striking, to put a man of common understanding upon inquiry. Thus—if a man should issue square pieces of gold coin, with his name upon them; or his own notes of hand, in the common fashion of such things, there would be no danger to the publick; for no man would take either, without proper inquiry and examination; and then, he would take it, not on the faith of the country, but on the faith of intrinsick value, or individual credit;—and he who coined the one, or issued the other, would not, thereby, have subjected himself to the penalty, for coining money. As for the method of bringing the question before the court—a quo warranto—is it necessary to trouble the court with the learning upon that point? The court consulted together, for a moment; and then told him to proceed. They were satisfied for the present, about the nature and mode of applying the remedy. (Hammond smiled, as if he wondered a little, not only at their ready acquiescence; but, at their permitting the question to approach them in any shape—in the way that it had—before they had fully settled the question about that)—“I have now done,” said he. ---“I have now done. I have shown, I hope, all that I set out to show—that this bank note, which I now hold in my hand, has been issued under a void authority; that it has been done too, against the whole spirit and analogy of our constitution; in defiance of all the penalties attached to an infringement of sovereignty, here; and that it is, in reality, coining money, in the worst possible way; levying a tribute, in that way of all others, most emphatically denounced by the constitution; that it is, in short, a matter, upon which grave men, the appointed judges of the land, whatever may be their opinion of him, who has arisen to pluck down the temple upon his head—if his reasoning be sound, must unite with him to bring it down, though all of us are stunned and blinded, with the thunder and dust of its fall; or buried for ever in the ruins!” Here ended his speech; and the judges upon the bench; venerable and sedate men, with countenances full of awful wisdom and deep thought, remained, for some minutes, in a profound silence; during which, Hammond passed out of court, like one assured and confident of the result; and triumphing in his heart, that he had turned the scorner to seriousness; and them that had smiled upon him, in compassion, when he began, to a tremendous repose—a repose like that which settles and weighs upon the spirit, when it looks upon the great ocean, at midnight—silent and breathless in awe; awaiting every wrathful movement; and like that, with which great men look upon revolutions; or the mustering of armies; or the preparation for political earthquake and hurricane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. Marriage...Reflections thereon....Fashion of the time....Confession ....Elizabeth... Jealousy....Romping...Levity... Beware of Mystery...Dreaming...Education...Apprehension...Love.... Consummation. The time of my marriage was now rapidly approaching; and, as it came nearer and nearer to me; there was an unaccountable heaviness upon my heart, constantly augmenting; a mournful, and rather pleasant solemnity; a kind of depressing tenderness, that made me weep, when I was all alone, without knowing why; and kept me mute as love and death, when I was with Emma. Yet, O, I could not have given up that gentle sorrowing, for all the fierce riot of the imagination; and all the frenzy and delirium of my past life. Now, I felt that I loved, purely and tenderly; for my only thought was for her happiness; my only tear that I should not be all that she believed me to be. “Tell me,” I would say, “tell me, love,” as soon as I could recover myself sufficiently to command my voice—“is there no doubt upon your heart, Emma, none? no question that you would ask me, yet? I have told you all —my whole life—no—I am wrong, I have not told you all.” She turned deadly pale—and leaned, in her helpless, faint sorrow, and alarm, for a moment, against my bosom. How could I wonder!—our separation, before, had been owing to an unintentional concealment—a little deceit—but no falsehood—on my part—; and now, to imagine, that such an event might happen again—oh, no wonder that she turned pale—poor Emma! “No, dear Emma;” I continued—“no! I have not deceived you. You believe me at this moment, by my own representation, rather worse than I am. What I meant to say, was this. If there be any question—which concerns only myself; and not the secret of another— ask it—and the truth is yours. That is such confidence, vol. ii. Y 2 as I ask—and no other. Now—as it shall be for ever I will do, as I would be done by.” “No:” she replied, faintly, reassured in some measure—“but, while we hold to this, would it not be well; (she faltered, for she never pronounced my name, when we were alone—she trembled to be familiar; and dreaded to appear formal—so that she would neither say William; nor Mr. Adams; and still less, what no delicate woman will, in any case—Adams, alone—it is too masculine—) to—to—be more heedful about admitting such confidence.” “Certainly—certainly, dear; now that we know each other; while our two hearts are so truly one, that their very blood keeps time—” (She plucked away her hand from me—with a slight petulant, movement, that made me smile; for my fingers were upon her pulse.) “Together—we ought never—never—to admit a confidential communication from any human being, but with the privilege of committing it to each other.” “In no case?” she replied, timidly. “In no case, love—perhaps a case may be imagined; one of life, and death; but I cannot, at this moment, suppose any situation capable of justifying a wife, or husband, in receiving what neither can, under any circumstances, communicate to the other. Is it not so?” “Really—I—I—after marriage, you know;” (colouring, and smiling, while her wet eyes danced pleasantly through her dark lashes—like revolving jewelry. I love to compare things with one another.) “Yes,” said I—“that may make a difference in our love—nay, it will—” “Not in mine—not in mine, I am sure—(very earnestly.) “Yes, Emma, it will—the mystery, and enchantment, of delusion, will be done with; a better, more permanent, and holier feeling—a deeper, and more quiet—and less passionate love, will arise in our breasts. We shall tremble less; and love more inwardly; with a feeling of warmth, quiet, and comfort: O, yes!—we shall be dearer, infinitely dearer, then, to each other, than we now imagine—but the feeling will be unlike that, which now agitates us. You will have done blushing, then.” “I hope not,” said she, affecting a little pettishness, to conceal her beautiful confusion. “What!” said I, pulling her to me—“is it so pleasant, to blush—or do you already anticipate an occasion for it?” She turned away her head; and pretended, for a moment, to be adjusting her collar; but I saw the blood rush into her fingers, till they were all of a transparent scarlet, almost as when a delicate hand is held, open, with the fingers shut, before a candle. “No,” said she—resuming a more serious manner— “I have nothing to ask—not a question. I have that confidence in you, now, that I believe you would not represent yourself better, than you are to me—; such confidence, as to believe, that, whatever is proper for me to know, you will tell me; if not now, at some future period; and that you do not distress me with the painful, and revolting particulars, of your early wandering, and transgression—not, because you would deceive me; not, because you are afraid to tell me; not, because you wish to conceal them from me—but because they are the secrets of others, more than of yourself; and because—(she faltered again)—you would not familiarize my thought with impurity, and wickednesss—though repented of.” While she was saying this, she hid her lovely face in her hands; and her hair, of shadowy brown, fell, gloriously dishevelled, over them; and I locked her to my very heart, in rapturous delight, and pride. “Perhaps,” said I—“there may be.” “I understand you;” she replied—“you are right. There is one thing in your temper, which alarms me. It is not what the world calls it; but it is a passion that makes me tremble.” “And what does the world call it?” “Jealousy—ah! your lips turn white.” “Jealousy!” I replied, affecting to laugh—“no---oh, no, Emma, I am not---I—” I, stopped; was I not selfish?---suspicious?---envious?---and do not they make a compound, quite as terrible as jealousy?—and very likely to be mistaken for it? Others had called me jealous---might it not be true? “But what do you think—Emma?” “To deal frankly with you, then,” said she, putting her hand upon my arm; as it lay over the chair—“I have no fear that you will ever be jealous of me—of my---what shall I say? I know that a certain degree of apprehensiveness is always the attendant upon true love; that we are only without that delicate alarm, and anxiety, where we do not love; and that, in proportion as any object is dear to us, is our perpetual terrour of losing, or sharing it; that is our whole nature. I mean to say, then---but here is Elizabeth!---she shall say it; she knows your temper, better than I—” Elizabeth had opened the door softly; and now stood, leaning over Emma, with full eyes, dancing in their brightness; and bosom beating high, and beautifully, from the exercise of walking. “Ah!—brother! brother!” she exclaimed—`anticipating, are you!—and ah, sister—bless me, don't blush, dear—I was only about telling you, that I would not— if I were you, Emma, dear, put up with any of his admonition, until I, could not help myself.” “Come!—come! young lady,” said I, pulling her into my lap—“no compassing the king's death here—by construction;—no treason—no rebellion. But you have come in good time; we are discussing a grave matter. Am I of a jealous temper?—or am I not?” “Are you serious, brother?” “Serious!—yes---am---I—jealous!---speak plainly--- comfort poor Emma—there—she believes.” “Nay, nay, brother—don't trouble yourself about what she believes: she knows you better than any of us; for all that quiet, decisive—hang it, girl, you won't let me speak to you, but you colour all over. What has happened? I shall begin to imagine, that— Brother! look at me—have you been whipping her?” “Nay, Elizabeth—speak to the question. Am I jealous?” “Yes,” she replied; starting upon her feet; and laying down her hands upon a great book—“you are indeed—upon my veracity, you are—” I was a little hurt. “Selfish too, I suppose,” said I. She nodded. “Suspicious?” “Yes, dear—any more questions?” “No, I thank you!—Why, What a mischievous wench it is!” said I, not a little nettled though, at her plain dealing. “Come, come brother, don't get huffy about it. Your jealousy, as Emma, knows is like yourself; the greatest oddity in the world. We call it jealousy, for the want of a better name; and because it is more like that passion, than any other. It grows, I do not like to flatter you—it grows out of your self-distrust. Nay; don't sparkle so, at the eyes—you are vain enough, on all other subjects; but, where you love, a sense of your own unworthiness—ha! ha! ha!—isn't that frank?--keeps you in perpetual hot water: and then you never give a fellow an opportunity for explanation; but, up you jump, and bounce off, as if you were full of congreve rockets.” Emma laughed outright--and shook her head at her. “Now,” said I, to Emma:---“may I be parboiled--- heart---and all---if you haven't been telling tales out o' school, young woman.” “Guilty! guilty!” cried Elizabeth. “Now for a confession! Help me, Emma,—help me! Don't stand there; shivering, like a moonstruck creature. Now is your time! If you mean to keep your ascendency, you must establish it in season. Bring him down—“down to the dust, with him!” “Out upon thee, witch!” I cried, “will nothing content thee. Spiriting up my sub—.” “Your subjects!—there! you see what you are coming to. After marriage, he would'nt have clipped that word, you may depend on it. If he had not been sure of you—now—he would have swallowed the first syllable, as well as the last—bad symptoms, Emma.” “Hush, hush”, I cried, “I do plead guilty. Why, what the deuce possesses the girl—are you mad?” “Yes! leave me be!” This was said in a manner so irresistibly happy—reminding me of one of my own snappish answers, that they both joined anew, in a hearty laugh. “By Jupiter!” said I, “girls! rebels! you will carry a fine hand over me, one of these days, if I do not put a stop to it, at once. I can feel my throne totter—the jewels blowing away, like dust from my forehead.” “Very pretty indeed!—was'nt that Emma?” “Very,” said Emma. “Come, be serious, will you—sit down, for a moment; and then we will all take a walk together. Do you believe, (my tone was very serious; for I began to feel a deeper concern, than I was willing to confess)—do you believe, that Emma has any thing to fear, from this jealousy of mine?” Elizabeth looked at me, till her eyes filled, before she replied; and then, pressing my hand, and Emma's together.—“Yes, brother—yes!—more than from any thing else; nay, more than from every thing else, in all this world. I will answer for every thing else—for your love, honour, tenderness, fidelity and kindness; but for that—that, there is only one hope! You must watch and pray, Emma—and you, for yourself, brother.— Emma, your hand trembles. Do not believe that he will ever wrong you, Emma. No, he will not—in thought, word, or deed.” “Do not believe that he will ever doubt your truth; or your principles—no, he will not; but, for a moment— hear me brother! hear me! my blessed, sweet girl, whom I hope to see the wife of my brother—hear me! I hope never again to speak of it—I have waited, too, for a long time: and, though I have trembled at the thought of it; and put it off, many, and many a day, when it has been upon my very lips, yet I am now glad, that an opportunity has arrived—for a moment, dear, he may doubt your love. O, do not weep so bitterly, Emma—I only say, that it is possible---possible, dear---the thing may never happen---nay, will never happen, as I am persuaded; but, still, I would have you know the worst, and be prepared for it. Have no reserve with him. Do not wait to be asked. He will never ask you a question, if he once begin to doubt— you will not be able to know what he thinks, unless you speak to him, of it. You will find his jealousy, then, to be unlike any that you have ever heard of. His manner will be more tender; delicate; assiduous, but thoughtful; perhaps, even sorrowful. He will never watch you—no---and should he believe that your heart faltered for another---you will only know whom it is, by the double portion of his confidence, and kindness, that will be lavished upon that other. Speak then--- speak, quickly, Emma---or my brother will be gone for ever! Have no mystery in your conduct. Do not wait to be told by him, that mystery is wrong. Be, for ever, as it is your nature to be, frank and communicative, with him. Believe nobody---nobody!---that would preface his tale by any hint of concealment--- do this, and you will be happy beyond the lot of women. But fail---O, Emma—I know his temper---his extravagant exaltation of sentiment---he would die, of a broken heart; away from you---far---far away---and you would die a widowed creature---without having heard one word of reproach, or upbraiding. Brother! ---do not weep---yes, yes!---weep, weep together!---I will leave you. The truth is now told. My heart is unloaded---and I will now leave you, together.” Neither of us could detain her. I felt poor Emma's heart beating hurriedly, and irregularly, against my arm, where it encompassed her waist---for many minutes after Elizabeth, had gone. There was a melancholy silence for some time. “You tremble dear,” said I---“but not with apprehension, I hope?” “Indeed,” she answered, faintly—“it is with apprehension. I am not afraid of myself. I do not fear that I shall ever deserve to suffer; in the way that Elizabeth has mentioned---but---circumstances—accident---and you are so impetuous---so heroick, I should call it, were it not, an unnatural violence, and elevation, too intemperate for any woman's happiness--- that you might break my heart---without---nay die, yourself, of a broken heart---without giving me an opportunity for explanation.” “Never!” said I, firmly---“never! We have already suffered enough, to teach me wisdom, on that score. No---Emma, whatever happen, as I have said, many a time before, you shall always have an opportunity for explanation.” “She carried my hand, convulsively, to her lips. What startled me!---what was it, then---that shot, like a cold adder, through all my heart! I know not---I--- I; but there was a something in her manner, too eager, too grateful---and abrupt, as if my promise were more important to her, than it ought to have been—which set me thinking Let me pass over the rest of our courtship—preparation and marriage. Enough, to say that we were married—as I always determined to be—without romping or festivity---with no mob about us; and, almost alone—feeling, at our hearts, that it was a religious celebration—upon which, to trifle was blindness, and deep infatuation. For my part, I can only say, that my sensations were awful—more so, I verily believe, than, if I had been called up, to receive the judgment of death. Not, that I did'nt love her—O heaven! with all my heart and soul. But, we had thought, until our hearts were heavy, of the deep accountability, into which we were about to enter. It was not my happiness alone, that was at stake; mine alone, here and hereafter—but, it was hers—hers! and, perhaps, of other immortal creatures, to be born of our love, nourished in our endearment; and left—O, righteous heaven! helpless and dependant—beset by temptation and trial—undiciplined, unsustained. Man, man!—hast thou a heart; and canst thou step, with a firm, and a high heart, unpreparedly, into a charge, so awful! Woman, woman! canst thou!—is nursing angels, angels that thou art to meet hereafter, in heaven, so light a matter, that thou wilt not even look serious, or devout, at the moment of passing the threshold of such a fearful duty. By heaven! it ought to bow thee down, with consternation and tears! Do you believe, that I saw no comfort—no blessedness in the future! O, ye are strangers to the heart of a thoughtful man, if you believe, while it is fullest and heaviest, that there are no pleasant sources of consolation in it; no sweet, inward fountain rippling, with life blood in it—like sap through the trodden leaf. No—when I held her to my heart; my own, my wedded wife; while our tears ran down, like rain, upon her white dress; and she sobbed upon my bosom, and trembled, all over, as if her dear heart would break—while the few that were near, stood around, with amazement—as if there were something ominous in such sorrow;—yet, even then, there was the stirring of nature within us; our hearts yearned, to be yet nearer to each other—and their incessant pulse and palpitation, were but the beautiful alarum of unspeakable tenderness—and delicate, bashful, anticipation. Even then—then! I grew dizzy—and felt a strangling sensation in my throat—a sudden darkness followed—and then, I saw my own boy at her bosom— as plainly as I can see this paper. I felt his little hands, playing about my lips; and when, a weary year afterward, we were standing together, at a window; she, holding her new born babe in her arms—by heaven! just in the very spot—as she was leaning upon my bosom—it all flashed upon me at once, and I told her of the vision, that I had at our wedding—while she hid her modest, blushing face in her great shawl. And then;—but no—I must not hurry with such rapidity to the precipice. My brain may become giddy, if I do—and I shall not have the force to finish, what I ought to tell. I would speak, for a moment, of our past trials. All newly married people have them. Prepare themselves, as they will, there will be some disappointment; some difference, between the realities of marriage, and their visionary anticipations. Ours were temperate, guardedly so; and, we soon found the advantage of it; for, each became dearer, and dearer, every moment, to the other, for having practised no deception, either on ourselves; or on each other. vol. ii. Z We saw little company; for, our resources would not permit it; and, none at all, for the first month of our marriage. Our sentiments were alike, upon that subject; my wife was no more willing to be exhibited to a parcel of impudent coxcombs, whether in petticoats, or out; or still more impudent women, the day after our marriage, than I was, to exhibit her. No!—if there ever be a time, when all the tenderness, and delicacy, and holiness of retired love, are most wanted, for the consolation of woman—when privacy, and silence, and loveliness are most welcome, it is in that hour of renewed being, when, all at once, the girl has been touched, and transformed into a woman. Yet, at this time, in the accursed depravity of the age; the gross indelicacy of fashion; women, who are ready to faint with terrour and shame, and confusion, are put up, pale, and trembling, like breeding cattle, at a fair, to be criticised, by all the town.—Faugh! REMARKS ON EDUCATION. My dear Emma—I am alone. How I shall get through the night, I know not---unless I pass it, in writing to you. I would have the education of a child begin, with its birth. My first attention should be directed to the development of his physical properties; for, so intimate is the sympathy between the mind and body, that each will always participate in the suffering of the other, exactly in proportion to its own delicacy and feebleness. A sound constitution of body; firm and hardy, though not a robust habit, being formed, I would begin to lay the foundation of intellectual character. The materials, I might have been collecting, before; the stature and proportion of the creature, that I meant to train up, for a good and great man, might have been contemplated, again and again; while its corporeal energies were moulding themselves into beauty and strength —but, I would never touch the mind; whatever I did, with the morals; other than, as if by accident; never, by any approach to system, until the body were, in a measure, complete. From very infancy, I would have, now and then, a deep lesson written upon his heart; but, never, a studied one; never one, that would require much thought, in the child; and, my system of education for the mind, should not begin, in general, before ten; and never, in any case, so far as my experience among children, has gone, before seven. I speak of the mind, now, love. But, the heart, and temper, I would put in training, from the first hour of a child's birth. My first aim should be, to subdue that fretful, impatient, peevish, petulant nature, so common to all children. I would deal plainly. If I said no, to the prayer of a child, I would persist in the denial, though I should be sorry that I had said no, at first. Why? Because, if I yielded, he would lose a portion of his respect for me; and I should be pestered for ever, with prayer and entreaty, if I were once to revoke my own law. This, I would do, for a long time, until the child were able to endure an errour of judgment in me; without losing either his love or veneration for me, but when it was no longer necessary for my authority, that I should be held infallible in his eyes, I would change my course. The first indication of ill temper, the very first, I would treat with immediate severity. But I would require the most conclusive evidence that it was ill temper. It might be pain; it might be sickness; but, if I were once satisfied, that the crying of a babe, though it were not a week old, proceeded from ill temper, I would make it smart for it, immediately. Women would call this barbarous. A mother would go distracted, probably;—but, if she were a wife of mine—if she resembled my wife---she would never interfere at such a moment, though her heart ran blood. When we were alone—I would listen to her; and, though I might not love my babe as doatingly, or as tenderly as she, yet I should not fail to convince her that I loved it as strongly; and that I would probably endure more, for its happiness and health. Why? Because, till it were capable of feeling an heroick nature lit up within its heart, I should often be compelled to appeal to its little senses alone, though my heart bled, as I did so. I should ay ---if a child be old enough to betray an evil temper, is is old enough to be punished for it. A puppy or a kitten, before its eyes are open, may be taught not to repeat certain things. And will you presume that the young of a woman, have less capability. O, it would be so cruel! say the kind of heart. How can the little creature know why it is punished? It does not know why. It need not. But, it is your duty to associate the idea of pain, with certain acts; and that of pleasure, with certain others, the first moment that it is possible. A burnt child dreads the fire. An infant will not readily touch a candle, that has once burnt him; or a kitten, that has once scratched him, a second time. Do not forget this principle. It is merely planted, like a flower, in the youngest heart, as an indication of the soil. Apply it. If a child should cry from ill temper; and experience the same pain, that it did, from playing with the flame of the candle; or the claws of the kitten, would it cry as readily a second time? No. Nature gives the hint. Let us profit by it. You will bear in mind, that I do not pretend to teach an infant the difference between moral right and wrong. That would be faulty, indeed. But, for want of properly considering the subject, there are many, who would ridicule, or reprobate my system; they will ask me, how a child can be taught what is right; and what is wrong, before it can reason. To this I answer—just as a blind puppy can be—not by reason, but by being made to feel, that certain acts are followed by pain; and certain other acts, by pleasure. Neither is taught morality. I do not mean to make either understand the connection between causes and effects. I only aim to make them feel it. It is God's system of education, that I would adopt. It is instinct and sensation; not reason, that I apply to. What keeps the babe from eating serpents?—or gnawing its own fingers?---or pulling out its own eyes? Sensation and instinct What teaches the little mouse to hide, with its glimmering eyes, at the purring of the young kitten? The swallow, to separate the head from the worm, before she feeds her young with it? The puppy to cower, when you lift your arm, or stoop, as if to pick up a stone? The chickens, born in the same nest, to keep away from the water, where the ducks are paddling? Instinct and sensation. A little experience suffices for a brute; without any knowledge of right or wrong. He never forgets the hand that has tortured him; the animal, that has worried him; and can we expect less of a babe? I hope not. I do not. I have known cases in confirmation. Tell me, Emma---why does the dumb animal crouch before the uplifted hand? Nay, before the menacing eye of a stranger? That is not instinct. Is it sensation?--- It is a compound of sensation and memory. Both are necessary. Have not our children faculties like these? As soon as the babe could articulate a cry, I would begin with teaching him, that, though he cried his little heart out, except from pain or sickness, he should be unheeded. I would never give a child any thing, sick or well, for which it cried. This would be one of the most difficult rules to observe---for, when there was any doubt, I would always lean to the belief, that the wailing of my babe was that of nature, in pain or sickness; and not, in mere ill humour. Once satisfied, however, that it was ill temper, though it cost my child its life; and me, mine own---I would not yield. It should learn, that the sure way not to get a thing, if it were a matter of mere pleasure; and not of health or necessity, would be to cry for it:---and that, even when necessary to it, crying was no acceptable or profitable mode of persuasion. My next lesson would be that it should never tell a lie. I would permit it to be silent. But I would say, never tell a falsehood, never, never!---in look, word or deed, though it be to save your life, and the lives of all that you love. This should be continually repeated. I would not begin with tempting him; but, in time, I would tempt him, even with pain and humiliation. He might fail, once perhaps, or twice; but, in the end, I should prevail. But, if he did wrong, whether intentionally; vol. ii. Z 2 or, from carelessness, I would not allow him to believe that a candid confession, of his fault, was an atonement for it. No---he should suffer:---but not so much as if he had concealed it; and less, than if he had tried to conceal it. Nay, I would never permit him to think it possible for a child to lie, and live---if it were not, that such a sublime mystery, would soon be derided, by even a child. He would see, and hear, and feel lies; and I could not conceal that such things were. But though I could not conceal it, I would teach him that a liar was a fool, and a coward. But if he did lie, I would never let him know that I suspected it, till I was certain of it. At first, he should not be permitted to imagine that he could lie without my knowing it;—and, as that wore away; for experience would soon convince him of that errour, so far as I was concerned; I would make him ashamed of the very thought, as of something inconceivably mean and dastardly. At a very early age, if he had any sensibility, I should abandon all the common modes of coercion. A blow, I should teach him, was not to be born; wherever struck, or by whom—never forgotten, or forgiven. But first, I would teach him never to deserve it. After the age of four, I should never strike him.— Nor would I, at any time, were it possible, by confinement, shame, or some interdiction of food, to make him feel, that pain was a necessary consequence of misconduct. That is the great secret. Children, like men, should never be permitted to think of pain, but as a consequence of guilt, or misconduct;—of guilt, but as of something that would be inevitably followed by pain. This association should always exist. Destroy it; and you destroy the man. Destroy it, and you destroy society. I would next teach him to keep a secret. No matter how he obtained it; or from whom: or, under what circumstances:--having been once admitted to the confidence of any creature; evil or good, I would teach him that it were better to die, than betray it. This would be a simple, but severe lesson; and, in time, I should qualify it, by mentioning the necessity of discretion in the choice of associates, and the imprudence and folly of such confidence. I would then teach him to bear pain; to think of death, as a matter of little moment.—O, God! how earnestly would I inculcate that doctrine; of dishonour, as immeasurably worse; and that cowardice was the greatest of dishonour. Still, I would inculcate, that a quarrelsome; rash; arrogant manner, was, next to cowardice, (the cloak of which, it often is,) the greatest of dishonour, short of cowardice. Take care, I would say, never to give a blow, unless it be well merited; and never to receive one, without returning it, though it be from a giant—in church; merited, or unmerited. Yet, beware how you obtain the character of a bully---or a quarrelsome boy. Be patient, kind, forgiving; ready to assist all your playmates in any peril, right, or wrong, at the hazard of your life; for if they are in peril, that is no time to abandon them; still less to admonish them;—and let them understand, at once, and for ever, that you will forgive any thing, but a blow. You may not be as strong, or as wise, as another; nor so tall; nor so handsome; but you may always be as brave. I could bear to see you turn pale as death, at the very moment, when you struck another; but I would never forgive you—if you did it, without emotion. He is the truly brave man, who fears most; yet, does his duty, notwithstanding; and I have seen a fellow with a par-boiled face, so weak, that he could hardly keep his seat in the saddle—and the sweat fell like a shower from his forehead; and his feet rattled in the stirrups; under whom, I would rather go into a desperate battle, than under others, that I have known, to whom death, and blood, seemed to be matters of indifference. The former was intellectually; the latter, physically brave—one was a constitutional; the other spiritual courage: one, the heroism of bones and blood, and insensibility to danger; the other, that of the heart, and a sense of reputation. When I was a boy; before I knew what heroism meant, I was struck by a little fellow. I was ashamed to return it, upon him;---but, there was a larger boy standing by—he was a new scholar—I did not even know his name. I went up to him, with my blood beating—he was the largest boy in sight---and gave him a blow in the face. I was severely beaten for it. But no boy of that school ever quarrelled with me, afterward. I was naturally a coward—yet, on that occasion, I was a hero. The same spirit stood with me. When I was eighteen, I insulted a middle aged, respectable man, very cruelly. A quarrel ensued. He said some bitter things. A few days afterward, we met again. I begged his pardon; but, before the words were out of my lips, his manner was so provoking, that I knocked him down. He thought that I was doing from fear, what I did only from shame. He insulted me; and I punished him on the spot. There, I behaved like a desperate coward—rather than like a hero. Now, I should do differently. I have learnt to forgive every thing in this world, but a blow: and that, I never will forgive. I take care to make this known, that no man who has a disposition to quarrel with me, may be ignorant of the stake. A child may soon be taught all these things—and you may then lay the foundation of his moral greatness. Does he manifest a partiality for any particular amusement? Do not be so foolish—I am addressing all parents—not you, my beloved—as to believe that he has a genius for that. Human creatures are born now, as they were five thousand years ago; and it is ridiculous to suppose, because a child builds card houses; plays with powder, or types, that he has a genius for architecture, war, or literature. What became of children, that were born with a genius for literature; or painting; or musick; or printing, before the invention of either? Does God supply our children with a genius, fitted to the discoveries and inventions of men, who are not to be born for centuries, and centuries, after they are dead. If so, it is probable that Fulton's alphabet may be traced, to his having scalded himself, some time or other, with the steam of a tea-pot—and that of Franklin, to a practice of stroking back the hair of cats, in a dark entry—or some other, equally rational, or philosophical pastime. No---do not believe in these manifestations of the Divinity. Look to the boy's face; movements; habits, and mind; and if you discover that he won't do for any thing else; do not make a parson, or a lawyer of him, as people commonly do, in a large and fashionable family. Be assured that it is the effectual way of making a worthless metal, yet more base. Do not teach the boy to speak pieces;---leave him unrestrained, even in company, to sit pretty much as he pleases. And not, as I have seen some men, and good men too, keep up such a cruel and intolerable system of observation, over the child, that it has no comfort of its life—and flies any where for relief—to the kitchen, rather than to the parlour---to anybody on earth, rather than to his own father. If you see any propensity to imitation, check it at once. Yet, if you find only enough of it, to render it evident that the child is not conscious of imitation, cultivate that. That is not debasing. Of course, I speak only of manner and action, and voice here, and such too, as are worth a little of our study. God has implanted within all of us, a burning sensibility to dishonour, and outrage. It is right, therefore, that we should be angry, on fitting occasions; for they will occur; and it is right, also, that the feeling of resentment, which is given to us, that we may not be trodden under foot by the arrogant, should be sometimes manifested:---but it is a base, cowardly spirit, that becomes tempestuous in its wrath, or noisy, in its anger. Let it be deep, solemn, mild, sorrowful, and determined. Then, too; if you must punish; your punishment will bear the aspect of justice; not of revenge. Away with revenge. It is brutal, bloody. The very beasts do not feel that passion. But by this, I do not mean that you are to forgive your enemy, till he be under your feet;--- or forget his indignity, until, in the language of scripture (for they understood such things well, at that time) until you have heaped “burning coals upon his head.” If you do not strike the insulter dead, at your feet, while the blood of your heart is all in a foam; and all your veins are distended to agony, with the heat that he has raised---never pursue him, never! for his blood —but merely that you may bury him alive in hot embers. That is all---and you have scripture for that. Make him feel, that he is in your power; and then, forgive him. Do not even ask him to acknowledge it.--- It is enough for you, that he sees your chariot wheels, about to roll over him; the armed hoofs of your chargers about to leap into his bosom---then, you will turn them both aside. Whatever you promise to a child, good or bad, that do you. Keep your promises with it, be they wise or foolish. This will make him respect you; and teach you caution in future. If there be two of you, never interfere with each other. No matter how wrong the wife is, at the time; let the husband never interfere. No matter how preposterous and violent is the husband; let the wife forbear all entreaty and remonstrance, till the children are sent away. Never speak to a child, in a passion---still less, strike it. But beware how you punish it, with a pleasant countenance. That is the cruellest tyranny. Let your front be steady; and your manner that, which he never sees, unless he have done wrong. Begin to treat him like a man, as soon as possible; not by reasoning with him; or by encouraging him to smartness; for few things are so detestable as your smart men and women, except it be smart children;--- but, by addressing yourself to his understanding, in matters of simplicity and plainness; and by showing him that you have confidence in him; and by expecting him to do, what your experience convinces you, that he is able to do. Let your punishment be proportioned to his faults, with great nicety; but never punish him, never, unless you have the fullest evidence of the fault; for that connexion once broken, between misconduct and mortification; guilt and pain;---he will begin to lose his reverence for you. It is better to be blind---than to see wrong. It is better to overlook two certain offences, than punish your child once, for a fault that he did not commit. The evil effects are many. If you cannot learn the truth in one case, you cannot in another;---he will say; and, in the end, will probably cheat you into a notion, that he is better than he is, merely because you have let him know, that you have once thought him worse than he was. In short---when you have once punished a child, for a fault, of which he was innocent, you have given the death blow to his belief in your infallibility. You have taught him that you do not know when he is guilty---or, that you are wicked and unjust; ---and that it is the same thing to him, whether he be innocent or guilty. Beware of that lesson. He will never forget it. Nourish in him a high sense of honour. Teach him to regard any withdrawing of your confidence and respect, as the most grievous punishment. Accustom him to reposing all his little sorrow, and humiliation, and discouragement, in your bosom. Be temperate; and uniform, above all things. Never permit him to weep. Let him understand, that that is unmanly, in every case; but disgraceful, to the last degree, to weep from bodily pain, or terrour. Would you stimulate him in his studies? Teach him to regard them as a privilege. Should he play truant? Forbid him to go to school for a month. A longer time might reconcile him to the punishment; and enable him to find new pastimes, and new companions.— Would you have him go to church?---fond of his Bible? If he be a bad boy, prohibit his entrance to the one, and his reading of the other, for awhile. If good, go with him to church: not in fine clothes---but poorly clad; with the privilege of giving away his superfluity to the poor, with his own hand. Do not, if he be a bad boy, set him to committing a hymn; or reading a chapter in the Bible; for it is the sure way, to make him hate them both. Such associations are destructive to our reverence for both. Hence is it, that we have so little true relish for the simplicity and beauty of Scripture; and for many of the richest specimens of eloquence in the classicks. They are constantly associated in our minds, with the recollection of our school-tasks; labour; coarse familiarity; and punishment. Neither should ever be seen in a school. So with every other study. By a judicious and unwearied perseverance, you may bring a child, as you may a man, to any habit of application, as to his food and rest. Create a habit; and you give him a continually augmenting impulse; an impulse, too, that is irresistible, exactly in proportion to the difficulty there was, at first, in forming the habit. Would you have him a lawyer? Do not name him after Mansfield, or Parsons, or Kent, or Erskine. Such things only make his first attempts, in life, a matter of ridicule. Do not put him up in a chair, to recite awkward verse, with a gesture, like the clockwork, that you see annually wound up, and exhibited, at Cambridge University; creatures cunningly put together: automata, that raise first one clumsy arm, and then the other, as natural as life, at every other sentence. Would you make a minister of the gospel of him? Teach him that he is to be God's vicegerent. Carry him to see Mr. A. Show him why that man is disqualified. He wants authority—voice—dignity—action. To Mr. B. His pronunciation is detestable; his whine execrable. Your nerves are jarred to death, by his barbarisms. Strange that men will be above such little things, as correct pronunciation, and clean teeth; when they know, that the best discourse—the most overpowering eloquence—lose their effect for awhile, if our ears be made to tingle with a provincialism. We cannot attend to the reasoning, where we are fretted with the sound; the meaning of a sentence is lost, if we are made to swallow it, word for word. To Mr. C. He is of the Boston school of Unitarians: ninety-nine out of one hundred, of whom, are the servile imitators of a young, ambitious fellow, there, who happened to be coaxed into the desk, when he ought to have been harnessed for the field;—or sent abroad on any mission but one of Christ and conversion[14] [14] Conversion—Quere de hoc. Does the author use the word in a religious, or legal sense? In the latter, I dare say—for nothing else would account for the zeal, and eagerness, and success, of some missionaries in conversion.—Ed. —all have his dainty action, and melifluous cadence—and sickening affectation. Bid your boy avoid that example, as he would chanting in the pulpit. Take him to Mr. D—, he is of the orthodox tune—Andover—or Princeton— look at his arms—his hands—watch him, when he meditates the pathetick. What on earth can be so ridiculous? Nothing, except his attempt at eloquence and storm. Why does he gesticulate? Why!—not because he feels; not because, there is any sympathy between the vessels of his heart, and those of his limbs: not because there is any illustration in their movement —for his manner and action; and voice and tone; and look and language, are perpetually at war. It is Cicero speaking---and Roscius acting---but then, you must suppose that each has a different piece; or that one is deaf and the other blind---or, you have no faithful idea of his gesture. But why does he use it? Because he has heard that, where he preaches, for a man to stand in the pulpit like a skewered turkey, is to be, not exactly the thing.---So he takes the hint, unskewers his arms; and flourishes them about, like a telegraph--- cramped---in a high wind---or, as the turkey might, if it should try to fly, after it was unskewered. Having taught him this---that action is not to be learnt by a diagram in the “American Preceptor;”— nor by the attitude of any actor, in any situation---take him to see what hypocrisy and villany are. Show to him a minister of the Most High---breathing fire and smoke into the hearts of men; and pollution into that of every woman, that he meets---a minister, arraigned, accused; but braving it out; and the women defending him. Why? Mistaken creatures! They are mothers and wives; irreproachable, it may be, for aught but their blindness and infatuation toward their pastor, who should be burnt to death; scourged to the bone, in the publick vol. ii. A a market place, by their husbands and fathers; and crucified to death, for the desolation, that he hath wrought in many a family of love; for the undying reproach, that he hath thrown upon the ministry of God---yet they adhere to him, till he repeat his offence---the scoundrel, lest, by abandoning him, they should seem to admit him to be guilty, him, who was the companion of their sick chamber, and death bed;---the only unprohibited visiter, next to their husband, even to the household sanctuary. Unhappy women! It is enough, for them, who break the bread of eternal life, to be suspected of such deeds, to authorize you to abandon them. Are they wronged? God will defend them!--- It is not for women and wives; mothers and daughters, to rampart, even a man of God, who is charged with such deliberate infamy. Ministers are but men— it is true---but they should be the best of men. No man should permit the live coal to touch his lips, until he be made sure, in a measure, of his resisting power; for, who of all men have such temptations?--- so uninterrupted, so seductive. They are bitterly watched. It is the better for them. The wicked and profligate love to spy out their nakedness; and drag them shivering, before the publick. They know this. He knew it---yet he spoiled the innocent---laid his profane hands, freshly, it may be, from the distribution of the consecrated elements,---the body and blood of Christ, himself---he laid these hands, first, upon the bosom of another man's wife---and next, upon the naked heart of the virgin. God! why slept thy thunder!---Why was he not reduced on the spot, to ashes and cinders!--or driven, by thine Angel, naked upon the cold world, with all the plague spots, black and fiery, as they were, upon his heart, revealed. Do we delight in such things?— Is it a reproach to us, that we delight to tear away the profane and lewd from the altar?---that we have the courage to pluck down the priesthood of sensuality, that are enthroned in the temples? No---we deny it not. We glory in it. Lead me to the man that, standing up before Jehovah himself; aware that the eyes of all heaven and earth are upon him—that the people of the skies are reading his heart, and shuddering at his blasphemy; and wondering at the compassion of God; and asking, with their eyes, and uplifted hands, if his patience and forbearance be not utterly exhausted. Lead me to him— let me hear him denouncing his fellow men—while his own heart is festering in corruption;—raining fire upon the sore places of other men—while he, himself, from the crown of his head, to the sole of his foot, is running with greenness and death; and I will pluck him down from the sanctuary, though he be clinging to the horns of the altar. Ah, that will I—while I have breath—for ever and ever. Teach the boy this—if he be to minister in holy things, that, it were better, never to have been born, than to go into the temple, with unclean hands. Then, lead him to another man—one of the pupils of Doctor —, a pupil, worthy of his master....one, that dares to stand up, before his Maker; and reason, with the arrogant manner, that men use, when they reason before their inferiours....one, that hesitates not, after the manner of his preceptor, to avow himself an Apostle... and interrogate the Divinity, even in the pavillion of his darkness---one, that tore a daughter, from the bosom of her father---ran away with her---married her--- and went into the pulpit;---stood up, before the men and women, whom he had been calling upon, for years, to “obey their parents,”---and defended it! Gracious heaven! to what has this world come, when the ministers of our holy religion, have the folly and presumption, and wickedness, to intrigue and plot, for novel writers and dramatists!---to steal away the daughters of their congregation---and then---to plead love! ---love, at such an age---and in such people. I do not say that I would not do this thing....but, I say that no honest man would do it. I do not say, that no man ought ever to set a father at defiance--- and break into the peace of a family, with fire brands, and bitterness of heart....but I say that a minister of the gospel, who remembered his duty, his influence, and his obligation....if he were worthy of the office, would have died, ten thousand times over, before he would have done it. But....it had become a matter of too deep an interest to the happiness of another. Ridiculous! Nay, worse than ridiculous. What!....would an honest man steal into the heart of any woman....abuse the confidence of a father....and skulk and prevaricate---yet, never consult him. Would not an honest, an honourable man, go first, to the father---aye, first! at the first symptom of affection, in his own heart, if he meant not to extinguish it---and lay his pretension and character before him. I do not ask if he should court the father, before he did the danghter---no!—Still less, do I ask, that he should engage the father's influence, or any earthly influence, over the heart of the woman; for, women are strangely jealous, on such subjects. To break the seal of a letter, first; to be the first, that knows of the tumult in another's heart, are things of inconceivable importance to them; things, that men cannot understand—but I do say, that, as an honest man, he should enable the father to do what the daughter never would —and, probably, never could do;—and that is, to enquire into his history and character, before her affections are engaged. Was this done? No. The poison is insinuated; a noble heart is drugged to death, in secrecy—and then, this anointed of the Lord, declares it to be too late, to think of duty—and that love must have way. My boy—I would say. Behold these men. They are beacons. Men are frail---their hearts will dissolve, though they be about the altar, if the hand of Love, or Wealth, or Ambition be laid heavily, and hotly, upon them---but, there should be decency in their fall. It should be regal, like that of Cæsar. They should gather up their robing around them and shut up their infirmities; and hide, if they could, the inroad, that had been made upon their immortality---and not fall, obscenely and nakedly, while the sacred elements were distributing. No---I would say---No, my son---if it must be; if thou canst not, in some measure, cease to be a man; and cast off the most profligate and shameful of man's vices, seduction and dishonesty; if thou canst not practice the commonest act of self denial, that, of forbearance in gross sensuality; nor be humble of deportment, even, in the temple of thy God, I would say to thee, then, Go down from the altar. Be a man, yet, though thou canst not be of the priesthood; tear off thy consecrated habiliments; lay them reverently upon the pile.... set fire to them, with thine own hands; and never, again, open thy lips, aloud, as an instructor, and an example to other men. Wouldst thou be a lawyer? Beware of this man's example. Shun it, as thou wouldst emasculation---. avoid the manner of that man, as thou wouldst that of a foaming lunatick---and of that---and that---and that; for reasons that, boy as thou art, if thou hast the commonest principles of good taste, or independence, will make them all hateful to thee. Take care to see the end of thy speech, before thou beginnest it. Above all---accustom thyself to thinking whole sentences, a once. I would as soon have a drunken surgeon blundering about me, with a sharp knife, as a lawyer, about my case performing experiments upon it, at my cost.... beginning a sentence, without knowing where it would carry him---and arguing, as the fashion is now, in circulo. Permit me---I know a man---a smooth spoken fellow ---one of the most gentlemanly and gracious of the children of men: remarkable, for his “vast legal erudition:” and truly, I am greatly inclined to believe that it is vast for no learned man ever husbanded his erudition better: and, where there is so little expenditure, with any accumulation at all, there must, in time, be a respectable stock---this man, of all that I know, I would have one avoid. His reasoning is literally endless---his learning, so profound, as to be bottomless---his faculty, immeasurable---his rhetorick, and grammar, unparalleled. No man makes so many points: and no man keeps them so constantly in view, all at the same time, as he. True, I have, more than once, thought, that the superiority of a lawyer's mind, should consist, not vol. ii. Aa 2 so much in seeing, as in not seeing. The disciplined vision never sees but one thing at a time: the, undisciplined, (in the person, newly couched, for example,) sees every thing, and in the same degree of proximity. The feeble mind, like the feeble eye, has to learn, after it has been couched, or lanced: not so much to see many things, as to see what it pleases, to the exclusion of every thing else. And, I have always thought that logician, and that lawyer, who made many points, in an argument, to be in rather a bad way; and that, seeing more than his neighbour, is rather an evidence, in both, of a weaker, than of a stronger sight: while seeing further is not. I mention this gentleman, because he is generally known: and I would have every admonition felt. I know not what more, I could say, my dear wife. Much is upon my mind: but, I have wandered widely, from the mark, and it is now too late to return. I cannot even pause, to reconsider it. Let it go, therefore, with all its ruin upon its head. That I am not mistaken, in many things: some serious; many frivolous ones, would be too much to hope, even with my presumption: but that, whatever I have said, has been said, honestly; with an honesty, equal to its boldness, I am sure. Farewell! How unlike any thing that I have ever written before. But, you will forgive it. Yours— WILLIAM.</field>

It would not readily be believed; I dare say, that our chief troubles for a time, were about petty, and trivial matters, such as the romantick, and poetical; or, in plainer language, the foolish readers, of foolish poetry, and novels, would laugh to scorn. Yet they were so;---and, my whole object in telling this tale, is to entrap some of these people, who never read any thing but poetry, and novels; into reading what will be of use to them, in spite of their precaution; and instil, if it be possible, some heathful doctrine into their hearts, before they are aware of it. Yet—this frank avowal of my purpose may defeat it—they will detect the hook—and avoid it; or nibble off the gilding, from the bait—or refuse to be drugged at all, however tempting the odour, or beautiful the colour of my preparation. Be it so, then. Their blood be upon their own heads. I would teach then, what nothing else, but humiliation, and disappointment can teach them— if they would let me. My wife had been educated in a frugal, domestick way; from her childhood, accustomed to children, and having the chief care of a large family, she had the best of instruction in the matter of training them. She was a woman too, of good sense—of practical good sense—; and, while she knew that I was neither a glutton, nor an epicure—she knew that, if I were not a beast, I would not be utterly indifferent about my food. Add to this, that I was remarkable for my regularity. My business was of a nature, that, if I hoped to prosper in it. I was obliged to be punctual. She knew this; and did her best to aid me in it. I never complained---never, by a hint, or a look, but I felt, soon after our marriage, that my business was diminishing; that I was fast losing my character, for scrupulous punctuality; indeed, so far, had my forbearance gone, that I dared not make an engagement, unless I was ready to go, without my breakfast, dinner, or tea. Poor Emma was distressed. She resolved, and re-resolved again, and again, every night when she went to bed, that the next day, the very next, she would turn over a new leaf—have breakfast an hour earlier at least—and just at the right time. Yet the next day came. I rose early; went about my business; returned, a whole hour beyond the time, announced for breakfast; and found the room cold—and the table not set out. This would happen—I know not how often:—but once, I met her at the door---and she coloured.---When I took her hand— “Do not scold me, dear—I—” “Scold you!” said I, kissing her forehead. “No dear, I shall never scold---but— “But—you know that I deserve it,” she added, smiling---`the servants, I do not like to blame them; but they always wait for you.” I called the cook up—: and repeated my directions, in a firm tone, to have the table set, whether I had come, or not, at certain hours. But scarcely had I given the order, than I felt ashamed of myself. It was unmanly. “I really forgot myself,” said I, to Emma—“that was your province; and it is capable of being misinterpreted. I pray you dear, to be a little more peremptory. Choose your own hours—there is the clock, you see. matters little what those hours are; but it is of the last importance in my business, that they should be certain. Tell the girl this; and, if possible, make her regard it. This will cost you some trouble, and time, I foresee, at first;—but we must be patient. And after awhile, it will be pleasanter for her, and for you; and casier, to conform to them. I see that you are hurt.” “Not at your reproaches—but at my own,” she replied—looking up in my face, in her sweet way. “I lament, that I had not been earlier taught, the importance of punctuality, in our household management.” “I begin to feel now, that it is essential to comfort; it will be difficult, I am sure, to learn a habit of so serious a nature, so constantly required too, in domestick economy—but I shall learn it---I will—” “Yes, my dear, I know it. I am not impatient. I am less so, I believe, than you are. Because, I know the difficulty of acquiring such a habit. Nay, I am less troubled about it, at this moment, than you are. But that it can be attained, is certain, in time; by one far less zealous, and less in earnest, than you. Look about you. Very ordinary women, you will find, characterised by consummate regularity. You will have most trouble with the servants; but we must be patient with them—make them, if we can, take an interest in our household; forgive a great deal—but, if all will not do, unpleasant as it is to keep changing them continually---you must turn them off. Let them understand this, at once. The first time, that they disappoint you, let the order go from you. I will have them look to you, as their mistress, whom they are to obey—and I am heartily ashamed of my interference a moment ago—but I forgot myself, and wished to spare you. Let them understand, that the first time that they disappoint you, for one half hour, in the time of meals, (unavoidable accidents excepted,) they shall troop without mercy—: and, that I shall forgive them for any thing, sooner than for want of respect to you.” Here ended our first lesson. The good effects were not immediately visible; but, before six months had passed, no man's family was better managed than mine. I was never afraid to ask a friend home to dinner, without notice---and was always sure of finding somewhat, that would be welcome to a hungry man, at a certain hour---and if he were not hungry, he ought never to complain, if the dinner did not please him--- he would get what I got---and what more would a reasonable man expect? There were some other little things, matters of no moment, that occurred; and some, that made me smile at her affectionate temper, and simplicity: thus, if I happened to eat more heartily, than usual, of some new dish, (only because it was new) I was sure to see it upon my table every day---if not every night, till I was heartily sick of it. These were the natural errours of a kind heart, and a watchful, delicate assiduity. Thus passed away our life, for the first year of our marriage; that season of trial, and apprenticeship; when all the secret affinities; and hidden antipathies of our nature, are sure to discover themselves:--- and when, under the process of assimilation, we learn that our permanent happiness in life, is not made up of large, showy items; that evenness of temper; patience; sweetness, and affection, are enough to make people happy; but that the higher, and more intoxicating sensations are more apt to be ruinous, than profitable. A husband ought never to be a hero---nor a statesman--- nor a poet---nor a demi-god. He should be a rational man; obedient, under adversity; submissive to heaven; and willing to toil all the days of his life, for little else than the quiet of a family. Would he be great; terrible—let him never marry. Let him break his own heart, if he will;—let him hazard his own life, if he dare—but let him not hazard the heart of another—the blood of his wife, and children. No, no!— no heroes for husbands! At last—O, how my heart eddies in my bosom, at the thought of it! I feel, for a moment, as if I had been in a long, long dream; and waked with the little soft feet of my boy, patting over my face. At last, I was a father. The hour of agony had passed; the hour of travail, to my spirit too; for I wept blood in my anguish, and affright—but, at last, heaven was merciful to me; and the dear babe was put into my arms. O, then, then! felt I, for the first time, the sanctity of our union consummate! Emma had born a babe to me. Our beings were incorporate for ever, and ever— anew—and heaven had embodied the essence, and spirit, of her beauty, and my strength, in one little im mortal creature. Ah, the tears gushed out from my eyes, as if my whole heart were running away. At last, I began to put in practice my simple theory of education—nay, not a theory—it did not deserve that name. I wanted my child to resemble me; and yet I wanted him to be brave, and good, and great; and I was neither—alas! neither good, nor brave, nor great. One evening, to induce an uniformity of opinion, between her, and myself—while I was alone, for the first time—at night—and away from my beloved Emma—I scribbled the following remarks, on education. They are hardly worth preserving---nor would they be preserved, had I not fallen upon them, accidentally, the other day, very much worn---the writing faded--- the ink diluted and spread; and the paper wet, as with a heavy, and continual rain---through every page--- and almost illegible. Alas! It was no rain—it was only the rain of her eyes---of her heart---poor Emma! She could not agree with me; and what could she do but weep over it![15] [15] See Remarks, p. 279. I cannot well pause now. I am hurrying, more, and more, as I approach the perilous place. Let me go over it at once. For three whole years, I was the happiest of human beings---prosperous in my affairs; growing in love, and reputation; with nothing upon this earth to distress me, except an occasional indisposition of Leister---or Anna, (my little daughter) or my wife. When one day— when— yes, yes, I will tell it---one day, on entering the room, suddenly, I saw Albert Hammond, sitting upon the sofa, with my wife; and, when I approached, he arose in some confusion; and I saw that she had been weeping. I trembled---I stood still---I bowed, haughtily, to him; for, some how or other, I had never been able to endure him, since the disclosure that Elizabeth had made to me; and, I had not seen him, for a long time. I had tried to be cordial; but. I could not. He returned my bow, with troubled eyes; and passed, leisurely, out of the apartment. I was entirely silent, for a moment; and affected a sort of unconcern, that I was far from feeling; but, lest I might appear to be pained, I entered, immediately, into a cheerful conversation, with Emma; taking no notice of her distress; and endeavouring to persuade myself, that I cared nothing about it. But, I deceived myself—I deceived her. Yet, I did not know it, till afterward—when I found myself, at midnight, walking my room, as I awoke, at the sound of a faint cry, from the bed. I started—broad awake—but stood, for some minutes, without knowing where I was, till I heard her voice again. I was pacing the floor, for some time, she believed—the sound of my steps had waked her—and she had spoken to me, repeatedly, before I answered. Poor heart—she knew not, that I was asleep. I leaned over the blessed creature—half sobbing, myself—and kissed her eye-lids, which I found all dripping wet, with tears. “What ailed you, William?” she said, leaning upon her elbow—and pushing back her beautiful hair, under her night cap. The star light shone in upon her neck and one shoulder, while she lay there; and never, in all my life, never did I see any bosom so touchingly beautiful. Her dazzling white hand held her transparent drapery about her bosom; and her damp eyes were lifted with such a reverential, and deep tenderness, upon my own, that, overcome by my feeling, yet, unable to explain it—nay, even ashamed to speak of it, I fell upon her neck, and wept—aye, wept, like a child. Yet, still, she was silent; silent as death, while her heart beat, as though it would burst through her bosom —what could I do? I was but a man. She knew my nature. She had been apprised of it, by my own sister; cautioned against this very thing. She knew, that I would rather die, than ask her, what Hammond had said to her; or why she had been weeping? Yet— O, was it pride that kept her silent? Wo to such pride! I can say no more. I loved her yet, passionately; and forgave her, in my heart; and sought there, again and again, to excuse her—but, I never slept in her bosom, again—never—as I was wont---I know not how it was—I loved her, none the less---I respected her, as truly---yet from that hour, I was, another man toward her. Not long after this, Anna was born---a sweet, delicate creature; and again, we passed away a whole year of love and friendship. In the mean time, my affairs had prospered, beyond all example; and I had taken a country seat, a short distance from town, where I spent the greater part of my time. It was a fine old mansion, large, and built by a French planter, of noble, if not royal blood; who had been driven from St. Domingo, with the wreck of a princely fortune, by the blacks....I had been told. It had been constructed, with every attention to comfort and seclusion. I was pleased with it, at first sight. I know not why....perhaps, from the vast, cool, roomy appearance of it....perhaps, from a certain air of nobility and foreign state, about it. It had been, for several years, under the superintendance of a poor family, who had suffered it to fall to decay, until just before I took it, when they had been pursuaded to repair. it. I would have bought the house, at once: but the lawyer, whom I employed, could get no satisfactory account of the title, and dissuaded me from it: adding, that he was not at all clear, about the right of the poor family, to receive the rent: and advising me, to correspond, directly, `after I was in possession,” with the alleged owner, who must have been a man of great wealth, and munificence. And so I thought....for, there was a great deal of foreign marble, iron, and mahogany, about the house: and, to complete the whole, it was said to be haunted....for what reason, nobody could tell: though, every body avoided it, after night fall---and no wonder---for it was a lonely and desolate place, with no house in sight; and only a few of the finest old trees in the world; and a sheet of water, completely hidden by great willow trees, set all round it. However, I liked the house, and so did Emma. To me, it was like an old acquaintance....it seemed to me, that I knew every part of it; and, so familiar, from the first, was I, that Emma spoke of it, as if she thought that I had lived in it, before. vol. ii. B b I saw Hammond, sometimes, but very rarely: and I had learned to affect a cordiality, that I did not feel. But, what alarmed me, more than anything else, was this I found out, accidentally, that Emma and Hammond had been very intimate, before we were married---or even acquainted. I wondered, now, that she had never mentioned it. Why had she never spoken of him, except, when it could not be avoided? Could it be! Death and darkness! The hottest fire would not have scorched me, like that thought! Who knows! I cried, who knows but she may have loved him! Elizabeth loved him—and—by heaven---it was true! I now remembered his confusion, the first time that I ever saw her. What, then, I had passed over, as unworthy of notice, now rushed upon me, like a giant. Love him! No, no....it could not be. Yet, Elizabeth had loved him---and she had been secret, too. No! No! I knew that her honour was mine; that she would sooner die, ten thousand deaths, than betray mine. But, what comfort was that to me? She had married me---but how should I ever know, imprudent creature, that she was, whether it was not, because she, too, like Elizabeth, had loved Albert Hammond, hopelessly. Monstrous and crushing as the thought was, it grew into shape, and proportion; and, such was the heat and tempest of my wrath, that, had not God struck my daughter to the heart, instantly, before my eyes, just when I was ready to perpetrate the deed, I should, most assuredly, have slain Hammond. Yet, just as had been foretold, I grew kinder and gentler, every hour, toward Emma; probably; for such is poor human nature—that she might feel the greater tenderness for me, when I should have done some deed of desperation. Often, very often too, when we have been sitting together, have I looked upon her gentle face, until my eyes overflowed;—then, kissed her chaste forehead—and left her, abruptly: sure that, —no, no—I will not believe, in spite of all that happened afterward—I will not believe it!—She did love me! Was I not the father of her babes? her comforter? her friend? her husband? her chosen one? Was ever woman prouder of man, than she, of me? But, about this time, a dangerous and beautiful creature, had thrown herself, immediately in my way. I know not why I did not rebuke her, at once, to the dust—my own vanity, perhaps; my desire of showing Emma that others could love me; my compassion too, for her—(the woman, I mean)—a stedfast confidence in myself; and in my own strength. We met, time and again. I put her aside. Time and again, did I forbear to destroy her, though she was importunate for death; until I awoke, at last, horrour struck, at what I had done. I had not been a villain—I had not violated my marriage vow; but, under the vain pretence of giving an innocent, but very imprudent woman, a terrible lesson, I had permitted her unpractised heart to delude itself with passion; to drug itself, with a mortal poison. One thing only, consoled me. I was innocent; and so was the woman. But, she owed her innocence, not to her own strength; no, but to my forbearance; for, once, she had been utterly in my power; once, so entirely at my mercy, that, when she came to her senses, I thought that she would have dropped dead at my feet. From that hour, we never met; and I had felt a reluctance to tell Emma of her, at all. But, I overcame it. I told her—and she wept, bitterly, very bitterly; till I, at last, was a little offended. “O, William! I would not have believed it. I have not believed it!” I was amazed. Have not believed it!---I—. “O, think not that I have been ignorant of it. I knew of every meeting; every one; and, I have waited till this hour, to hear you disown it: and now, with all my confidence in you, that---merciful heaven! how you look! your eyes! your lips.” I know not how I looked---but I fell, as if she had cut me to the heart. What!---how could convince her. I had told her, now; but how would she ever know that I had not told her, because I was afraid that she knew it, or would know it---from somebody else; O! death! death!—what bitterness of heart followed that thought! “I did not believe it, William—I did not!---O, hear me!---I have disbelieved it all. Letter after letter, have I burnt, the moment that I saw an allusion---that ---(her tears gushed out, again)—I have waited to hear you disavow it.” I thought of Hammond---but I was silent as the grave---he must have been the slanderer. The slanderer!---how could that be! How should he know that we were innocent! He could not. There were all the appearances of guilt. Letter after letter!---what did she mean; what letters?— Emma threw her arms about my neck; and sobbed for ten minutes, as if her heart would break—“your looks are---are--terrible William--don't---do---don't— look so—they terrify me to death”---said she. I fell upon my knees---“Emma!” I cried---“Emma! you know my truth! You must, you will believe me! By my hope of salvation, I have been true to my nuptial vow, in thought and word, and deed! As there is a God in Heaven, I am innocent! As I hope for his mercy, I knew not that you knew a word of this; or that you ever would hear of it!” This appeared to comfort her. I could perceive it; her sobbing grew less audible. `It was imprudent, dear,” she said, however, in a low whisper. “Yes, it was---I admit it. Sure, as I was, of my strength, it was tempting Providence;---nay, for I cannot deceive thee, I am not sure that, if I had been certain of never being discovered, I should not have”— “O, in mercy! do not tell me so, William!-- do not!” she cried, looking her hands, with a low cry, of intolerable anguish—“You would not have denied it?” “Never!” said I—“never. I would have been the first to tell you of it—and leave you for ever”—(she shuddered all over.) “William! my husband;” she said—carrying my hands, passionately, to her mouth—“say not so!—whatever happen—whatever—the time is past now, for any other separation than that of death. Neither of us would survive it. Do not be rash!—It might happen, dear, it might, strong as you are—that—Oh heaven! —no, no, I will not imagine it—it would kill me—but if it should (wildly) O, I pray thee, do not abandon me —me!—and thy little ones!—kneel down, William— kneel down, with me—O, for the love of heaven, William! do kneel!—Come Leister! come! (the child had crept up, and buried his yellow head in her lap, holding on at her dress, all the while)—Kneel there, dear! Down, down, with thee, my boy!—Swear to me, William—(I had knelt too, I could'nt have stood upright)—Now, swear by thy hope of happiness, hereafter!—by all our love—our children!—never to abandon them!—never to leave them---or me---whatever may happen to thee!” I obeyed---bowed my head upon her shoulder, and wept there: but I could not utter a word. “Yea---it was rash and presumptuous in me;”---said I---“my heart reproaches me for it;---it is not doing as I would be done by—a sister; a wife; a daughter; a dear one---how could I endure that!--- Ellen, I am wrong. I should pray in my heart, that they might be taught wisdom, by as cheap a lesson. No!---I will not reproach myself. I deserve praise, rather than blame (she shook her head mildly—and the tears, from her overcharged eyes, fell upon Leister's uplifted face---“mama!--it rain mama!” he cried---“O! mama! mama! ou choke my hand!”)—I did that which no human being would believe---I forebore to destroy a woman—that---nay dear, if it distress you, I will say no more about it.” “Thank you,” she replied, inaudibly; but the motion of her mouth was full of thankfulness and modesty. “Allow me,” I continued, “to say only this, dear Emma, for your consolation---I have risen in my own confidence.” “I am sorry for it, William. It will lead to danger” —she answered, meekly. “And,” I continued, “much as I regret it, on some accounts; yet, I have done as I would be done by; and I would thank the man, who should have done just so, and no more, by a wife, child, or—how pale you are, dear.” “I feel very sick and faint---I—” she attempted to arise---but her strength failed, and she fell into my arms. vol. ii. B b 2 The very next day, my sweet Anna was seized with an unpleasant tightness across the chest. We endeavoured to relieve her---not that we were at all alarmed about her---but—I cannot well bear to repeat it---the poor, dear little thing died—died, in the deep night; and, for a time, all my acquiescence and submission, was a sick stupor; a dark and blind, and obstinate tranquillity. And, when that had passed away---rage, and anguish, and throes of downright rebellion, to heaven. Emma was altogether more patient and submissive, than I---hers were the sorrows of a mother,— her heart bled in wardly, silent as death;---and, while she prayed to be obedient and resigned; she wept, as if there were nothing left, upon all this great earth, to love; and nothing, in heaven or earth, that could comfort her. I carried Leister to his little sister's coffin; and tried to make him comprehend what death was. He cried and screamed; but his childish sorrow was soon over; and I could hardly forgive him for it. It appeared to me, so unnatural---and he kissed her dead mouth; eyes; forehead and hair, at my bidding; and wept bitterly, for a little while, because he saw his mother weeping; but, the next moment, almost, I heard his joyous laugh, below, as if delighted at his release. My heart contracted, suddenly, at the cry. I remembered the affectionate, caressing temper of Anna. It appeared to me, for a little time, that it were better for me to be buried with her --but- -poor Emma! she wanted comfort. In the first shock, she bore the bereavement better than I; but, after a little time, I found that what I had taken for fortitude, was really but a sort of stupefaction. She had been stunned by the violence of the blow; and it was only when life rushed back to her bruised and sore heart, distending it with new blood, that the agony was felt to her. O, then...then, learnt I, something of what mothers feel, when a part, of themselves, hath been suddenly smitten with death; blasted in its beauty--buried---buried...buried, before their eyes! For a whole week, we dared not mention the name of our child; but Leister was perpetually inquiring about her—and, one evening, when I had been startled by some tone like hers; and turned around, half expecting, in the forgetfulness of the moment, to see my little daughter there—I found his mother in tears. “How like it was!” said I. “Yes”...she answered...“I thought that it was Anna herself---the dear prattler. He has many of her pretty ways, I find, now...I never observed them before; and, indeed, once or twice to day. I have been struck with that resemblance, which every body has hitherto seen, except ourselves...what a comfort it is!”—God!...where am I...now...now!—Oh, what a cruel delusion...I had forgotten where I was...all that I had suffered and lost —many years, and many deaths.” “It is natural,” said I...“We cannot see our children grow or change; (seeking to comfort her) but others, who see them less frequently, do. We are struck only by the difference—strangers, by the resemblance in children. We wonder that they are not more alike...they, that are so much.” “But ah! how different in temper, they were. She was so affectionate,” said my wife. “Nay, my dear Emma...that is human nature. The green turf hallows all that it covers. Whatever is lost, irretrievably, to us, becomes inestimable. This poor boy has a thousand qualities, that will twine about our hearts, yet...we must be prepared for it;...and prepared, love,” I added...“for everything. It is the only way.” “He understood me, and shuddered...leaning upon my shoulder.” “How good and beautiful, she looked!” said I...“when she took the medicine—mouthful after mouthful—the dear, little, patient creature...and permitted the leeches to be put upon her face; while her very flesh crawled; and she shut her eyes, and held her breath, for terrour.” “Yes, and when she said, “good by'e cousin!...and good by'e. pa—” the poor little thing!” “Do you remember, too,” I replied, dashing off my tears, with a brief feeling of consolation.. “how she looked, when she asked me, if she was going to be put into the ground?” “Remember it!—O, my husband—do I not remember it! and how her clear eyes looked up to heaven, when I kissed her, and told her that she would go to God — “must her stay with God, ma'—,” said Leister, putting his head into her lap...“won't he let her come back?” “No, my child;...but, if you are good, he will let you come and see him.” “And sister too...I want to see sister, ma'—I do want to see her”—(here he began crying for a moment— but was very speedily comforted.) That was the first blow—but—now bear with me. The last is at hand—I— * * * * * That great house grew awful to me after the death of Anna—I was afraid to be alone in it—I determined to remove—but, some how or other; and, contrary to all my habits of life, I kept postponing it from day to day; and from week to week, till I had'nt the heart to leave it, desolate, frightfully desolate, as it was, to me, after the death of my child, with my small family. How often--ah, how often, have I started, at the sound of my own footstep, when I trod the great landing of the main stair case; and heard the hollow, rumbling echo, that followed, through every room in the house, like something subterranean. Aye, and stopped and thought, intently, about it—as if—I know not what—but, I swear to you, that the feeling which I had at such a time, was much like what I should think a man would have, who had lived in some other shape, before, in the world. I felt as if, when I had been something else—no matter what —beast or man—fowl or reptile—I had been a tenant of that old habitation. And yet, it was impossible that I should be familiar with it.—I had never seen it, till the very week before I had hired it; and might have lived, for ever, without having seen it, but for an accident. In walking one day, altogether alone, I was gradually seduced by a strange appearance of familiarity, to something that I had seen before, in the walk—to persevere; until I came in view of a large, noble looking house. People were at work, in every part of it,— and the setting sun was shining all through it—till the windows looked, as if there were a great fire in every room. I did not enter; but stopped to talk with a savage looking old man, who was giving directions about setting up a sort of enclosure, that had been broken down---the very traces of which were nearly extinct.--- I was a good deal struck by his countenance; and entered into conversation with him. He told me, in a few words, without once looking me in the face, that he was repairing it for his master, and meant to let it. I determined, on the spot, a thing that I cannot account for, it was like nothing that I ever did before...to take it, on his own terms; and to remove immediately. A few days after, the whole affair was completed; and we were most comfortably situated for the summer season; but it was very bleak and bitter in the winter, at our new mansion. But enough of this---I should not mention it all, but for the singular feeling that used to take me, every now and then, by surprise; either at the sound of Emma's voice ...or that of my own; or, at the situation or appearance of something about that house...which made me start broad awake, sometimes, as if I had just then discovered the mystery: and yet that mystery would always elude me; and leave me, nevertheless, strangely dissatisfied with myself and my memory.” One day, I had just been fitting out a ship for Smyrna. She was all ready to sail; and I had been so very busy for some weeks, that I had scarcely time to eat or sleep; and, for the second time, since our marriage, had slept away from home. Yet, I was very happy; and the more so, for having determined, in my own mind, that if the issue of this voyage should be prosperous, I would leave off trade; quit the city, calmly; and go into some quiet retirement, where I could “live, love, and die alone”[16] [16] Quere. Should it not be “live, love, and lie alone?” Ed. —with my own dear wife and boy. It was within a week of my birth day; and I was planning a thousand pleasant dreams for the future, on my way home; and felt, I do believe, a more bounding pulse, than I had, since Anna's death; and all my heart was running over with warmth and tenderness. A friend stopped me; an aged and good man—there was a strange seriousness in his manner; and he led me, before I knew it, wide of the way home. Reader—be patient with me—I cannot tell thee, what he said—shame and passion will not permit it. Something, I had heard before; something, in the shape of rumour; but I had laughed it all to scorn;—and now, for husbands are the last, either to hear or believe such things, I would have torn the tongue out of his throat, by the roots, had he been a young man;—but, at him —I only laughed—bitterly, I do suppose; for my tears fell upon my lip, I remember; and made me start, while I laughed, as if they had been drops of molten lead. I went directly home—patience!—patience!—thou proud heart—patience, for one moment!—and then break if thou wilt, into ten thousand pieces!—I went directly home. There was my boy; my beautiful, bright eye'd boy, at the door;—he ran into my arms, and kissed me, repeatedly, where I stood, upon the great marble slab, at the first landing.—I remember that, because he was bare-footed; and, when I put him on it---he kept jumping up and down, for a whole minute-- laughing and slapping his hands together, like a child in a bath---and exclaiming cole! cole! cole! fader ---O, how cole him be! fader!---fader, proper cole!--- till my hot eyes ran over upon his face. Ah, little knew I, what it all meant. I heard Emma's voice; and ran up to the room---the little parlour above---and there,---paused a moment, with a strange, unnatural feeling of doubt and suffocation; for, as I laid my hand upon the lock, I heard, what my disturbed senses took to be, the sound of a man's voice, in low conversation, “God forgive me!” I cried, putting my hands to my temples, as if I had been guilty of blasphemy---“a man's voice!---with my wife!.. at such a time.” I opened the door, reader, I did, as I hope to go to heaven, with a smile of affection upon my lips, ready to tell her, the woman herself, how foolishly I had been alarmed, and how, for a moment, I had dishonoured her---and— * * * * * * * * * * —I entered—a man was there!---she was struggling, and in tears; but his lips were upon her hand. It was not yet dark---but I could not mistake him---it was Albert Hammond. For a moment, I thought that I should never breathe again. But the next, I was calm ---very calm; calm as death. I went up to Emma—she had fallen upon the sofa---at the sight of me---with a cry, as if her heart had broken--gasping...and white...I went up to her. I pressed my mouth to her cold forehead. My boy ran to me---for a moment, I was on the point of dashing him through the window...but I forbore; I merely put him upon her bosom...pressed my lips once more to hers...to her eyes---to her cheeks, and murmured in her ear...farewell, for ever and ever! She was senseless; but, at the sound, she shook in every limb... moaned...and her lips moved—but, I regarded her not. I turned round...the apartment was empty; I went staggering, through the rooms, I know not whither; till, all at once...as I stood again upon the great marble slab...I saw...like a flash of tremendous lightning...a perfect explosion of brightness—or my eyes cheated me, the same lamp lying there, with the oil running out of it--that I had seen twenty years before, in my dream—and heard one general outcry of desolation; while I bounded, from the top, to the bottom of the stair case, at one leap—as if, at that moment, our whole household had broken up, and departed for ever. I rushed onward, grappling my own throat, I have been told, since, and shrieking as I went—for my dream, that horrible dream, was all before me!—and I cursed myself that I had never discovered it till then.—Emma was the woman that I saw!—that was the house!— and that was the frightful desolation, which I had seen in a vision, shadowed out to me, till my hair rose!— Onward I went!---blind and dizzy; doing, I know not what; saying, I care not what; but there were people, that I passed, I remember; and animals; or the shadows of men and animals; for they cried out, and fled from me; and still I paused not; nor breathed; nor turned aside; but went reeling, headlong, toward the city; all my past life confounding itself in my mind, with the present and the future. It was like a great ocean breaking up in midnight darkness...covered with ice and fire -- human creatures...wreck and ruin;...and the first thing that I knew...after, I know not how long a time ---only a few minutes, I should judge, if any mortal man could have gone so far in so short a time;...I was near the water...standing and looking at it, and wringing my hands;...and the next intelligible thing that I knew, is, that I stood upon the wharf;---and that the stars shone fifty feet, down, into the dark water, just as they had eighteen years before, when I had been well nigh drowning myself...for a moment, it appeared to me, that all that had passed since, was a dream,— that I was still a boy;...but the dashing of oars, sounded near me; and I recollected my purpose. “Wait for me, till twelve,” (it was then nine) and no longer— weigh anchor, and be ready, at this spot, to take a man on board, who will come”...said I. I then went to my counting room...wrote a farewell letter to Elizabeth;...some instructions about my property, giving it all to my wife and child; appointing her brother to its management;...took a pair of pistols from the desk, and went in pursuit of Hammond— We met...! don't know how...but we met...God brought it about. I handed him a pistol, in silence. He refused it---I tendered it, again---he still refused. —I threw it at his head; and, deliberately, levelled at his heart. He never moved---he did not even cover his face. I saw his dark eyes; and, if anything in this world, could have persuaded me of his innocence, it would have been his untroubled forehead, as the star light shone upon it; and his large, humid eyes. I fired, and he fell. The report of the pistol alarmed the watch. They sprung their rattles; and I ran toward them, as if calling for assistance. I was universally known; and, when they saw me, and heard that a man was wounded; they gave themselves no trouble about me; and, I ran down, immediately, to the wharf; sprang into the boat; and, in three hours, we were leaping, with every sail set, through the blue ocean. To me, it was like a dream. Was I a murderer! “Probably:” I answered. Why need I dwell upon what happened, in the voyage? I will not. My house---and the voice of my wife---and the desolation of it, were all before me, night, and day. We were once driven all over the water, it appeared, before a hurricane; lay, waterlogged, utterly helpless, and dismasted, for four days, and nights; every moment expecting to go to the bottom---the great sea making a perpetual breach over us. Yet, I never trembled, nor prayed---heard nothing, nor saw nothing. The sky was like a great room to me; and the whole world, like an untenanted house. But, at length, we arrived at Smyrna. There I sold my ship, and cargo; put the proceeds on board of another vessel, returning, for the use of Emma, and my boy. Yes, my boy---by heaven, she never dishonoured me. I know it---I feel it, in every artery. I felt it, even while I kissed her for the last time---but no matter. I then went, with a little gold in my pocket to Constantinople. Seven months, had I been there, when, one day, as I was wandering in the Greek suburbs; or rather the Galata, where the merchants of all nations are permitted to assemble—I came, suddenly, in contact with an apparition, that made me leap from my feet. I could not see the face. It was dressed in black, after the manner of the Greeks; but the shape, and gesture, were—what folly!—I really trembled to see it turn round, it was so like Hammond. It turned. Gracious God! It was Hammond, himself! He uttered a cry of transport, when he saw me. I stepped back—and shook with passion; for though I had repented of his death, while I thought it probable, that he was dead, and I, his destroyer; yet, now, that he stood before me strong in health—I began to feel for my dagger. He saw my purpose. “By heaven, William Adams,” he cried. “This is too much for mortal patience. I will bear with it no longer. Thrice have I saved your life; twice would you have taken mine— and all to no purpose....now! but, raise your arm against me, a third time, and by the living God, I will tear you limb from limb!” Vol. ii. Cc Where was my strength, then! By heaven, I was in a sweat, from head to foot. A child could have slain me. There was that, in his terrible voice, when in wrath, that shook me to dissolution. My ancient cowardice returned upon me—and strangled with fear— flooded, and drowned all the valour of my blood, and heart. I was like a child, before him. “William Adams,” he repeated, approaching me, but with his arm, folded---“I want some conversation with you.” “Begone!” I cried, as soon as I could find my voice: “begone! man!...devil! and leave me. Begone!—” “You dare not follow me,” said the Dwarf. I turned, I am sure, with the bitterest expression of hatred, and scorn, that he ever saw in man's face; for he shrivelled before it, for a moment---and then walked on, as defying me to follow him. I did follow him—so closely that, had he but turned upon me, I should have driven my lifted dagger up to the hilt, into his neck; but he did not turn; nor look behind; and, for my soul, I could not strike him, an unarmed man, without seeing his face. No!...I could not. I followed him to the very end of the great canal, passing through the suburbs of Hassan Pashaw, and Taphana, unmolested. At last, just at the entrance of one of the Bezesteens, or market houses; he turned full upon me; stepping back one pace, as he did so; and stood—as if he suspected my purpose; knew the whole nature of my heart, and what I was waiting for—at the distance of about six feet from me, leaning upon a Turkish cimeter---naked, and glittering like a crooked flame. “William Adams,” he said, a third time...“I have not sought your life---but I am weary of my own. I heard you speak, many years ago, of your skill in the broadsword. There is a cimeter, (throwing me his; and instantly flourishing another, in a circle of light, around his head.) You then signified a desire to amuse yourself with me. I have never met with my match. You would have slain me---I knew it by your breathing---as we came along. I would not have the weight of my blood upon your heart, William, in any other than an honourable way. You are now armed. So am I. We shall find but little difference in the whirl, or guard, of a cimeter, and sabre. Only---if you mean to cut---you must not strike---but present the edge---and thrust. It has the temper, and the edge, to sever the bones: it is not by a blow, that they cleave their felt turbans here. What say you? Shall we set our foot here, in silence, under that blue sky--- under the very eyes of God, who hath commanded us not to spill our brother's blood--here!—giving nor taking no quarter, till the disenthralled spirit of one shall rush into his presence, from where we now stand!...streaming with blood. What say you? My patience is entirely exhausted. You are silent. I know not what you may meditate; but I bid you beware, if you think of grappling with me. One blow, and I will show no mercy, whatever may become of me. You have worn out my nature; turned all my heart to bitterness...year after year, sir, have I pursued you for your—speak!—is it battle, and death, or not?” I had taken up the cimeter---but I was unable to stretch my arm...I let it fall. His voice penetrated to my very heart. What it was, I know not, but an unaccountable belief took instant possession of me, that he was innocent, and wronged. “I know not, Hammond, what is the meaning of these tears....I would not have believed, two hours ago, that it was in the power of any mortal creature, to make my heart beave, and yearn, in this way...to conjure up, as you have, such a feeling of humanity in it....to....O, man, man! I weep before you; I, that have not wept for a whole year...I stand weeping before you, and am not ashammed of it. Tell me...are you not a villain?” “No.” “Have you not wronged me?” “How?” “No subterfuge, Hammond: if you have, you know how...I cannot speak it. Have you not wronged me?” “No, Will am Adams...no...so help me God!..neither in thought; nor word; nor deed!” “I know not,” said I, “rightly, where I am...but... there is my hand...let us go home...my...my...wife—” He shook his head...but he embraced me; and I endured it, though I felt the truth breaking in upon me again...and then...well, well— we shall soon come to it...I—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Return voyage...Wrecked...Reduced to extremity...Death of... Ah, heaven!---It is past midnight—I see it by my watch---I cannot sleep. Distressing, and awful dreams have set upon my heart, and wrought within it, all night long. I cannot support it many months longer. I have not had one quiet sleep, for many weeks, since I found that letter---rash, rash man—O Emma!...Emma! No!...not for a single hour. Ah, what would I not give for one short sweet slumber---- one blessed dream of forgetfulness! It is four weeks this night, since I finished the last chapter. The work is near to its completion; and as if, with the ending of it, my own life were to end, I cannot advance a step, without weeping---and yet, why should I weep? Why sorrow? The world is dead to me. There is not one heart left within its cold circumference, holding any affinity with mine. And I...oh, there is no desolation like the widowed one---; here am I, a shipwrecked old man---old, long before my time; a childless father---a wifeless husband---a fatherless child. O Lord! Put thou me, into the middle of the deep ocean--- where a black sky, and a black water are all about me, and over me, and under me; helpless, and alone; and thou canst not make me more desolate than I am! What have I done, to offend thee, O, my Father! What done?---peace fool, peace!---down, down, thou rebellious heart!--What have I not done, to offend a righteous, and benevolent One! Father! father! have compassion upon me---spare me! O spare me! I dare not meet thee! I am afraid to die! My days have been few, and full of trouble---yet---thy will be done!---nay, nay---that is all a lie---I cannot say---thy will be done---I cannot--- no...would that I could prevent it! Then would I never die, and thy will...O, my Maker...never should be done...but mine! vol. ii. Cc 2 I have looked back upon the last chapter. I foresee that I never shall live to complete, what I have attempted. Some other hand may do it. I wonder that I ever had the courage to attempt it; and though, I have told but little of my eventful life, I wonder more that I have been able to tell what I have, so distinctly...so carelessly. It is incoherent, to be sure...but I wonder, that it is not more so. I shudder too, sometimes, when I think that — yes! I will tell it...when I think that these are but the symptoms of that terrible malady which has shaken our whole house, generation, after generation, to the dust. I—O, Emma—my wife! my wife! I return. It matters little how Hammond succeeded, in winning me, to embark for my country...but he did succeed; and, though, by a tacit agreement, we never spoke of, nor alluded, to the past; yet we were constantly together, on our way home, to my family...no, not to my family...I was determined never to see her again. Innocent, or guilty, it mattered not...but let me not taint her pure name...she was innocent...I feel the conviction here, here, warm at my heart, bubbling like the milk of woman...to nourish some hope of hers, not dearer to her, than this of mine, to me! My blood will bear testimony to it...but innocent, or guilty, it matters not. She knew the penalty of concealment. She rashly encountered it...and—I trembled whenever I thought of it. What had become of her? I dared not ask. Nor did he dare to mention her name. What he reserved for me, I know not:...some pleasant surprise, it may be.... poor wretch!...but he never approached the subject, except once, indeed, when..I came upon him, suddenly; and saw him thrust a miniature, that I could have sworn was Emma's, into his bosom...his tears fell, like a shower of dew from the tree tops, into the smooth sea; for we were lying becalmed, in a water, so clear, and beautiful, that the shadow of the ship was like the ship itself. He came to me, and took my hand; and, perhaps, for he thrust the other into his bosom...perhaps he was about to give me the miniature...but I flung aside the hand...and walked away from him. The next time that we met...there was a dead silence between us; but he came to me, at length, and would have spoken to me...I knew that he would...of my wife...but he dared not. I looked at him, and he stood appalled before my eyes. Again, he would have put some papers into my hand, but I threw them from me. “No,” said I...for the last time...“No...in no shape, or manner, or form, will I ever listen to you, or to her!” His manner was very solemn. “It is for your peace, William...that I ask it: and yet, I doubt if your peace would be promoted by it---but, farewell! My resolution is now taken. There are the papers! Do as you will about reading them. But I would advise you to take them; and, when I am dead, if you should survive me...read them.” “No,” I answered...“No!” spurning them with my foot...“I will never touch them again.” Hammond calmly took them up; wiped his eyes; and we never exchanged another word, till more than a month after, when—I struck him bloody, and blinded to the deck of our shattered vessel. Let me tell you how that was...We were drifting, a fiery wreck upon the wide ocean...not a spar standing...the ruins of our vessel yet smoking about us...reduced to the last extremity of famine, and fury. Just then, when all of our crew, but three, had gone raving mad before my face...as I stood, with parched lips, and throbbing eyes, that I could not shut, for the soul of me...I saw the most beautiful vegetation below me, and bright water, rippling through it...turf...and singing birds; and slippery pebbles...God be praised! I cried! leaping into it. But some devil held me back. It was Hammond...I raised my arm, and he fell, the blood gushing out of his ears, and nostrils; but he still held on, and I...I... I, Obanquetted on the loathsome...I— no matter, here was another time, that he had saved me...another, and another! And then, we came home, home!—and then—O, My wife! my wife! * * * * * By God---I will tell it. Emma was in her grave. She had died, of a broken heart. Leister was in his grave. He had died, immediately after I left him. My sister---heaven for ever bless her---she was yet left to me! kinder than ever, but---a little, a very little disordered, from the calamities and trials that she had endured, and—. And I---O, my God! my God!---have mercy upon me!—I knew that I should never live to finish it—have mercy upon me! O, have mercy!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Conclusion by Hammond...Explanation...Elizabeth...Fate-of William Adams...Early intimacy of Hammond and Emma...Emma's letter to her husband. A manuscript has been put into my hands, by a woman, who, while she was living, had no equal upon the earth. She was upon her death bed; and she commanded me to take it, and relate all that had happened to her brother, from the time that his reason last wandered; and to read no more of it, than what she seemed to intimate concerned myself. The rest was sealed up; and I have just read; or rather, last night, I finished reading, all that I was permitted to. My hand shakes yet, with terrour and grief; and, I can hardly persuade myself, that actions, so innocent as mine; so well meant, as they were, could have been capable of such an evil interpretation. I remember my own agency; and I shudder at it. I look back, in vain, for consolation; in vain, for the proud feeling of self approval, that upheld me, at the time of the catastrophe. I am innocent—and yet, I am inconsolable. What should I be, then, had I been guilty! I quake, to think of it. Eight years have now passed away, since William Adams, the brother of Elizabeth, was struck crazy. He was an extraordinary man; and, if he should have done justice to himself, in any measure, while telling a part of his own history, the reader must have been satisfied of it. He had few equals; but, his passions were tempestuous, beyond all example. I know not what he may have said of me; for, I have not been permitted to read it; but, I have gathered enough from Miss Adams, (his sister,) on her death bed, when she committed the manuscript to my charge, last summer, to believe that it is a true history of his own life. If so, I have, probably, a material share in it; for, at times, we were friends; ready to die for eachother; and, at times, he was my mortal enemy; but, always generous; and, never my enemy, but when under mental alienation; or some strong and terrible delusion. He died—I must be forgiven, for coming to it so abruptly; but, I cannot bear to think of it—of mortal apprehension—died, from the fear of dying. “O, God!” he was heard to cry out, one night, as if in prayer, a short time before the utter destruction of his faculties; “O, God! God! have compassion upon me! I cannot dwell in the uninhabited place—Emma! Emma!—I am afraid to die!—O, no! no!—I cannot die—I dare not! O, my God! my God! let me live a little longer—take me away from this desolate house!—Hide me, where thou wilt; O, Lord God Almighty!” And, many a time has he caught the arm of the keeper, while the writer was remonstrating with him—and held him, with his white teeth chattering; his lips, blue and swollen; and, to use the keeper's own words—“his nose, livid and pinched up;” and shrieking out, that he was haunted by two jabbering imps—“there! there!--- do you not see it?---O, Christ! Christ! have merey on me. I cannot die---I cannot! Emma! Emma!---pity me---pray for me! Do you not hear him? He keeps saying, death is near! death is near!---O, you do not hear it---you must hear it! Ah, my dear friend---stay by me---O, do! do!---Will you not?---O, Lord God of heaven and earth! have mercy upon me! No living creature about me!---not one---and a house like the universe!” And then, he would fall away into a paroxysm of terrour, as if he saw something. Alas---he was, after I knew him---the greatest coward on earth---respecting death. He knew it, and acknowledged it; and trembled like a child; and cried like a child, when they ventured to speak to him, about death. But, enough of this. It is frightful to think of it. The family are now extinct. He, poor fellow, died but a few months ago; and Elizabeth has just followed him. My obligation is now in force. I have but just left her green, untrodden grave; and I cannot die in peace, until I have fulfilled all that I promised to her. She, too, was a very extraordinary creature; but, probably, her brother has already left an account of her; if so. I will not attempt it. There is a vividness in his language, when in conversation; (I know not how he may write, except, from the little that I have now read) that would leave me nothing to say, if I were to follow him, on the same subject; and there were a truth and sincerity in his nature, so opposed to all artifice, or concealment, that, whatever he may have said, may be depended on. I know what I say---and I am willing to abide by it. What he may have said; even of me, evil or good, I am sure, was of his knowledge and belief. But, enough of this. By looking back, upon the incidents related, so far as I have been permitted to see them: and recalling dates, I find that the manuscript must have concluded about the very time; and, perhaps, on the very night, that he was found wandering, in a heavy rain, about the church yard, where his wife, of whom he had been distractedly fond, lay interred. He had been shut up in his room, for more than a year; and the letter which is added to this, lay open upon his table. How he came by it, I know not. He had refused to see me; or hear from me: and more than a year had passed, since I had abandoned the thought of explanation; or attempted to put her letter into his hands. I never knew how he came by it. It was in my case, and I never missed it— but it could not have been long with him; for I remembered having seen it in the usual place, with her miniature, which I had once obtained, without her knowledge, from an artist to whom she sat—and had worn, all her life. From that hour, he never spoke a rational word. At times, he was outrageous; and, though there were minutes, when he would look piteously upon me; and pluck out a whole handful of his hair, at a time (which had turned as gray as an old man's of seventy) and sit a whole day together, and look at it—and then walk about, as if he neither saw, nor heard, nor felt any thing; yet I am sure that he never had one hour of heaven's light, within the deep darkness of his brain; nor one glimpse of reality from that, till the time of his death. Yet such were his amazing powers of expression, that they were many serious attempts made to get him liberated from confinement, under the strange belief, that he was not mad, but melancholy; and only wanted a little gentleness, and attention, to bring all his faculties out anew. Alas!—their commiseration was vain. He was stricken to the heart; and, when he died—poor fellow---there was an awful, steady melancholy in his eyes, while he rivetted them upon me; that, had I not known beyond a doubt, that he was mad, would have terrified me into a belief, that he was dying, not of delirium, but of a broken heart. Sometimes he would talk of blood, in a low voice, to himself; and say that many visions, which he had once, in his early days, were all now fulfilling: and then: but nobody attempted to fathom the wandering of the unhappy man—that there were worms dropping about him—; and then he would rebuke the keepers of the hospital, for abusing him, as if they were determined to deprive him of his senses. Strangers went to see him; and some of them came away, I have been told, fully possessed with the opinion, that he was not deranged; or, that if he was, it was a derangement produced by a black conspiracy. Poor creatures! Who would have conspired against him? Violent as he was---overbearing as he was---there was not a dry eye in the city, when God smote him with madness; not a heart, that did not heave with compassion, and sympathy. O, better would it have been to be exposed to the fury of wild beasts, than for men, that had so practised upon his stout heart, and noble talent, to show their faces abroad. But, let me leave him. He died, I fear, under a feeling of relentless, and implacable bitterness towards me. I am sorry for it. I did not deserve it. Soon after his death. I was induced to make some enquiries about his family, or that part of it, rather, which I had not personally known. I succeeded beyond all expectation, by an accident, that I cannot mention here, without a breach of confidence. Enough, however, for me to say, that, from having been continually with his immediate relations, I was mistaken, I suppose, for his brother Sampson Achilles, who was also deformed, and dwarfish; and entrusted with a manuscript, which I have the best reason to believe is true, wherein I find a record of the family, with all its intermarriages, for nearly two hundred years. For my salvation, I would not make that record publick—it is a catalogue of nothing but crime and madness; desperate suffering, and destructive genius. Several of the earliest of the family in this country, perished in the ancient Indian wars: one of them, whose life is contained in the manuscript, of which I speak—a woman—was hung at Salem, in Massachusetts, for witchcraft—and sorcery—: another nearly related to the father of this Mr. Adams, a young and beautiful girl, destroyed herself in a manner, that would be believed impossible—absolutely impossible. She had always been remarkable for her violent temper, and great beauty. When a mere child, such was the former, that on one occasion, she was confined to her bed for two months; covered with blisters—having no less than six upon her at one time, merely because her school mistress had slapped her, on the hand:— more than once did she attempt her own life, before she was twelve years of age: and her beauty was so extraordinary, that an agent of the royal government, to the last colonial governour, of Massachusetts, mentions it, in one of his official despatches, of the day, as absolutely “wonderful, and miraculous.” He—himself, lived to see her a corpse. She loved—and, the passion of love, in such a child, was the breath of life to it. Her parents discovered it—she fled to the woods— went among the Indians—was found, almost naked; and squalid, with suffering, and sickness—brought home, confined, tempted—but all in vain. Her last words were. Let me go free—treat me kindly—and I never will see him again, without your consent; but— treat me, in any other way—and my blood be upon your own head. They left her, taking care to secure the doors, and windows—and removing all possible means of self destruction, as they thought—even to the bed cords, and the bed linen—and the glass. But when vol. ii. D d they came to the door in the morning, and tried to open it, they found it fastened within. They called. It was frightfully still. They burst it open. She was found dead—lying flat upon the floor; with her face— swollen, and discoloured, though very beautiful, in a basin of water. In that way, had she died. Who, that ever lived, could have done the same thing. I have known one case like it, since:—that of a man, who sat down, and leaned his throat against a rope, until it strangled him. A second was quite as terrible—nay, a thousand time more terrible than this. It was the case of an uncle on his father's side. His name was Augustine. He was a proud, wayward, melancholy man. He was married—and had five children. He kept company with nobody; and nobody knew whither he went sometimes, for days together. He would take up his rifle; strike into the woods; without giving his family any notice; or preparing them for it, by any symptom of departure. No one knew where to look for him— and nobody dared to enquire—for he was known to have shot several Indians—and one white man, under pretence of mistaking him for an Indian, because he was lurking in his path, in a time of great peril to the white settlers. At last, he grew jealous of his wife— yet nobody knew it, till, after his death; for she loved him passionately, though she trembled before him. He was the handsomest man of his day—I have heard several people declare, who knew him: tall—square shouldered—with an eye like the bald-eagle—and an arm, like that of the panther. At last, he determined to die. And, that the woman of his heart might feel it—he determined to die by the hand of her own children; those very children, whose legitimacy, he never could have doubted, if he had not been a madman; for every one of them was the talk of the whole county round, for his beauty, and courage. One day, when his wife had gone to a neighbour's— he put on his wedding clothes—dressed himself with great care—collected a great quantity of brush-wood; made a sort of cabin of it; lining the whole with the, driest, that he could find—and leaving a small hole just large enough to admit his body. He then disposed about the cabin, all the little, pleasant, endearing relicks of early affection, that he had left; and commanded the largest boy to go to the house for some fire. The boy refused—for there was something, he said, so frightful, in his father's look, that he was afraid to leave him alone. At last, however, he consented— and brought the fire. That done, the father kissed all the children—embraced them all—wept upon them all—told them to be good to their mother; and to love the “baby,” the child, then at the breast, which was the real cause of all that he had done—and then made the second child set fire to the brush-wood. It was all in a roaring blaze—in a moment. The pitch, and rosin, and combustible leaves, were lighted up, instantaneously, as by a flash of lightning. The children fled, screaming, to the woods. And the neighbours, afar off, suspecting that the Indians were upon them, blew their horns, and mustered man and horse, in every direction—and kept pouring in, to the rescue. They found the wretched man, and tore him out of the flames, in spite of all his powerful resistance, and half suffocating curses; but he broke away from them again; and threw himself into the blaze. They were reinforced; and, at last, succeeded in extinguishing the flames, and dragging him out—with a great part of his body burnt to a coal. He could hardly utter a sound—but the noise of cursing, and bitter reproach, was continually issuing from his whole chest, which was outwardly consumed, so that the motion of his lungs could be seen, agitating, and convulsing, the cinders—that still adhered to his whole body. Yet he did not die—that night—but told them that they were fools, and deserved death to them, and theirs—for their meddling—that he had been sold to his MASTER, who would call at eleven, the next day, for him; that, if they had let him die in his own way, his body and soul both, would have been consumed; and the MASTER outwitted. The most remarkable circumstance, after all, perhaps, was that—precisely at eleven, the next day, he died. But the other case, in the same family, was, if possible, more terrible yet; and a thousand times more affecting. One would be led to think, that a judgment was upon the family; for none of them seemed to die, if I may trust to the manuscript, in a natural way: perhaps, however, it was only a constitutional predisposition to blood—a derangement, that led to bloodshed. The last was the case of a younger sister, whom I well recollect, for the uncommon brilliancy of her dark eyes. She was married to the younger son of a British nobleman; a small, but very handsome man; who, if report told the truth, had been a sad profligate, at home. She loved him to distraction—and bore three children, the youngest of whom had remarkably large blue eyes, totally unlike the rest of the blood. I have never heard the story aright; and the manuscript is not very satisfactory—but the amount of it is nearly what I shall relate—: a part of it I know to be true, from my own knowledge; and the principal facts, I will answer for. It is only in the less material circumstances, that I have any doubt at all. This child with the large blue eyes, when about eight months old, had became the very god of the father— to the exclusion of all the other children, and even of the mother. It was for ever in his arms. Scarcely would he permit it to go away, for a moment; and, at last, he actually slept with the boy in his bosom. For a long time, the mother appeared to be pleased with it,—and doated but the more fondly upon him, because he doated upon the child. Before the birth of the baby, as it was common to call the youngest child, in every family, he had been hardly ever at home;—but now, he was never away, nor abroad. The people wondered at the change;—and a thousand strange and foolish conjectures were afloat. Some said that it was not her child—but one of his—that he had contrived to exchange:--and some were wicked enough, to say, that the other children were not his; or that he thought so. Whatever it was, however, the wife, at last, grew uneasy. Go to the house when they would, they always found her looking seriously, at the baby, and rocking the little creature, all the day long, with her foot upon the cradle. At last, however—the catastrophe, which I am about to relate, took place; some said, in consequence of a meddling, bad woman, having come to her house, and told her of a girl with very large blue eyes, whom her husband had loved to distraction, before he married her; others, that a beautiful girl, with the whitest neck in the world—and the largest, clear blue eyes---from over the sea—who knew the family of her husband; and only came to die upon his bosom;—had come one day to the house, when he was absent—and had fits, when she found that he was married;—and others, who are supported by the manuscript, say that poor Margaret (that was her name) had once found a miniature among the papers of her husband, long after their marriage, of such a blue-eyed woman, with a profusion of hair, like floss-gold;—and, that he had amused her with some idle tale of school-boy love, until she had forgotten it;—but, that, one day, she came into the room unexpectedly, and found him comparing the face of the child, with that of the miniature, and weeping all the while. She stood over him, says the writer, and heard him sob—and saw him take a bunch of golden hair out of his bosom, compare it with the hair of the child—and hold it to his own eyes and mouth, and then to the mouth of the babe—and then fall upon the neck of it, in a paroxsym of tenderness—during which, with her poor heart smitten to the very core, and her brain giddy—she escaped from the room, without having been discovered:-and that, from the hour when she saw that, her own eyes were no longer the same—they became cold, unsettled, melancholy, and were always full—till one day a strange woman, with blue eyes did come for her husband, when he was away—and, after sitting awhile, fainted away, and was put to bed; and that, upon the bosom of the unknown woman, after it was all over, was found the string---a ribband twisted ---soiled and torn---as in a desperate struggle---for the blood of her neck was on it, with a small piece of gold adhering to it---from which a miniature had been vol. ii. D d 2 wrenched, while she was insensible; and ground to dust, upon the floor. After the affair was all over---it is told that people tried to discover the features of the person, in the broken ivory; but, that it was all in vain. And the strange woman, when she awoke, and found her miniature gone—which she did, before she discovered any other sign of life, began to scream, and tear her hair; and never stopped, until she, herself, was a corpse. But let me return to poor Margaret. By and by, the husband came home; and, contrary to his usual practice, he went to his wife first, where she sat, as usual, rocking the cradle; and kissed her forehead— before he attempted to take up the child, or even to uncover its little face, and look at it. “You look very pale Margaret, what is the matter with you?---and now that I look at you, again---why, what have you been doing. You are dressed like a bride. I don't know when I have seen you look so lovely—and---but why so very serious?”— “Faver,” said a little fat, bare-footed boy---cuddling up to him, and leaning against his father's arm, which was affectionately resting on the mother's lap—“Faver--Hi--hi---mammy--ee--ee--is toot---and tut, tut-off ee baby's head.” The father paid no attention to the child, for some time; but kept playing with his hair, and talking to his wife; and complimenting her on her appearance. “But why so serious, Moggy---have I offended you? Nay, nay, your eyes, love, are strangely altered...hush (the child kept repeating what he had said) hush, you little rascal...what's that—no, no, Margaret...let him stay... what is it, that he says? You understand him best.” “Ask him yourself, Edward” said she...It was the first word that she spoke, and the last. “Gracious God, Margaret—are you ill!—your voice frightens me”—said he. “Come here, Bob—what's that you say? “Hi---i—me---mammy.....mammy....I's a feered--- Faver.” “Speak! will you.” The boy attempted, several times...and, at last, succeeded in telling the wretched man, that his mammy had cut off the baby's head, with a sharp razor. The father went to the cradle...turned his eyes upon his wife...who smiled, and fell back in convulsions;... threw down the clothes, and found that the child, had told nothing but the truth—the head was really cut off..and the cradle was full of blood. I he story. I admit, is almost too horrible to tell... but I know it to be true, in all the material circumstances. And truth may be forgiven, where fiction should be execrated. Such was the family on the side of the father; and such an abstract of their history. What wonder that my poor friend became the inmate of a mad house, at last. But let me return to him again. Before he married Miss Larence—nay, before he saw her—I had seen her, and loved her. But there were circumstances to prevent me from ever acknowledging my passion. She never knew it. And when I found that they had met; and were truly devoted to each other; as I had no hope for myself, I did all that I could to promote their marriage; cautioning her, however, as I did, (for I was an intimate friend of her, and her family, for many years, though Mr. Adams knew it not, for reasons, which I shall explain, by and by,) to beware of two or three dangerous propensities in his character. But she was a woman;—and though I told her very plainly, that he had shown symptoms of derangement, more than once, (from violent passion, I believe)—was distinguished for a certain high handed profligacy among women; and jealous beyond all example. Yet, she so loved him—that she could not give him up. I saw this—when it was too late;—and, when it would have been death to him and her, if I had been discovered to have had any agency or acquaintance with her. Perhaps I was wrong; but such were my motives; and such was my belief at the time. The result has shown, that I had been wiser, had I been more open and direct in my counsel. I am sorrow-stricken now; but my heart does not reproach me; for I acted then, with the best intention; and feel, only, what every man of common humanity would feel, who had been in any manner instrumental, in the suffering or destruction of another. At last, however, I grew alarmed. Emma Larence (that was the name of the woman, whom he married) became too passionately fond of him; and, though I knew that he would sooner tear his own heart out, than shed one tear upon her hard, if it sullied her; yet, I did tremble for her. I knew her nature, too well. I knew that he would never marry a woman, whose heart he had not tried in fire; who was not capable of resisting him to death. I interfered, therefore, trembling as I did so; lest my interference should be mistaken by her; her, whom it was difficult for me to approach at all, without a trembling and sickness of the heart; and sure that, if it came to the knowledge of Mr. Adams, he would cut my throat. But, he behaved to her, like a man, at the last moment---a man!---yea, like a prince! Never had I thought so much of him. But when I looked, with some degree of exultation, to their future marriage, now that he had redeemed himself so gallantly— I found that he had been dismissed---and insulted! I knew his temper. I was amazed at his moderation. I inquired into the affair; and, from my soul, I pitied her inexperience, and their infatuation. William Adams—I must take the liberty of calling him so, yet —was of an unforgiving temper, till he knew her; a man, that would have taken her out of her bed, at midnight; and set fire to the house, if the thought had entered his head—six months before, was now so bettered, by his love for her, that he bore, patiently, with what few men like him could have born. I spoke to him of it, and asked him how it was. “It is for her sake,” he replied, with solemnity. “I love her, too devoutly; too truly, to hazard her happiness, in any way. She was right, in dismissing me, for a time; but, she did wrong, to leave me no hope, none; after I had humbled myself, as no mortal man had ever seen me humbled before. And I am afraid that she will live to repent it; but, assuredly, I do hope that she may not. I love her, yet—I shall love her, to my dying day. But, I have now done all that I can, for a reconciliation. If we ever meet, it must now be, by accident. I cannot advance—and she dare not. I am bound, by my own feeling of honour and rectitude. I have done all that a man, a man of honour, and a Christian could do. I cannot advance—and she will not, though she die, and I die, while we are both wishing for a reconciliation. I know her well; better, I believe, than her own father knows her; in some parts of her character, I am sure that I do. His interference was wise, and humane; but, the determination was her own—altogether her own—uninfluenced, as I am told, and believe; (for, I have never met her, since)—nay, even against his influence; for, he urged a greater time, for consideration—and told me, in black and white, that, if her determination had been otherwise, he would have promoted our happiness, by all the means in his power.” Your prudent parents dare not attempt to influence the judgment of a child in marriage!—Why?—Their reason is admirable. Lest, if she should be unhappy, she might blame them! The same reason should prevent them from ever giving her any advice. If it be not useful in weighty matters, it is impertinent in light ones. Any advice may be disastrous. I have suffered keenly—just enough to learn, that, a certain degree of bruising, quickens our sensibility, and makes our heart sore; but encrease that, ever so little, and you deaden the one, and make the other callous. I have already mentioned what the father said. William repeated it, word for word. He told me that they were apart, in all probability, for ever. This was unexpected to me: I began, now, to feel some confidence in her wisdom; to repent that I had interfered at all; for, such love as his, could not be mistaken; and, if, under all the irritation of a dismissal, he could still speak so feelingly; and so reverently of her, I felt persuaded that he was the man, to make her happy, beyond all others. I determined, therefore, to bring about a reconciliation, so soon as I could be satisfied, that it was wisest and best. I waited for some time, I felt that such things should not be hurried; and I felt, above all, my own accountability, if I should have had any hand in such an undertaking. Time would give me an opportunity of studying his character, more closely; it would prove his constancy, and principle; and love; and her's also. And, more than that, it would enable me to understand the nature of that infirmity, to whose visitation, he had been formerly subjected; and that strange jealousy of his, the nature of which, I never rightly understood; or I, certainly, should have done differently from what I did. After much inquiry, and reading, and consultation, I found that this temporary derangement of his, was nothing more than a blind and tempestuous passion. ---Subdue his passion; and his madness would never return. This was a difficult task; but, so long a time had elapsed—nearly a year, during which, I had never seen him, but once; and then, only for a moment, transported, beyond the common bounds of rightful anger, that I began to feel tranquil, on that score. I set about the reconciliation, therefore, in good earnest; and, that neither should ever have cause to reproach me, for my agency, I made it secret and natural. Another good effect arose, from this conduct; it kept each, uncertain of the result, till it came to them; and, they were happy. I permitted neither to make the first advance—and neither, to believe that the other did; thus, keeping a reservation for the worst, in case another separation should occur. At last, they married. And, if ever man and woman were happy, upon this earth, they were. He was a most wise, attentive, gentle, affectionate husband; and grew more and more amiable, under her sweet influence, every day of his life, All the world could perceive it. I loved them both; but, there were reasons, which prevented me from going to the house, except on particular occasions. I was not envious of their love. No!—it made my heart feel warm, to look upon them; and their sweet boy—the bravest-hearted little fellow that I ever saw—but, I never left them, without a melancholy feeling, that saddened me, for many a day afterward—almost beyond my power to shake off—a sensation, that nearly blinded me, at times, when busiest with the common transactions of life. The fact was, that—but no, there is no necessity for telling why I was so deeply interested in her happiness and his. They removed into the country—to a magnificent old mansion—which I never entered without feeling that I was in the habitation of princes. I mention this, because the tremendous desolation that fell upon that house, a few nights after he left it—had an effect upon my mind, that I can never forget. It was struck with lightning; and, for five minutes, I am told, it was all in a bright blaze; the smoke, and fire issuing from every window, door, and chimney, in it, as if a great quantity of powder had been blown up—and then it was all as instantaneously dark again. Perhaps it was blown up—for once, I remember hearing a terrible intimation from him, that—God!—I am frightened at my own thought—but I must tell it—and while, I do, I wonder that it never occurred to me before. He once told me, that, if he were ever suspicious of Emma's love—he would destroy her, himself, and all the children—either by fire, or powder—and that he was prepared. I laughed at the time; for it was in a moment of pleasantry—but now, I remember it, with horrour; for it is quite possible that the lightning, when it struck the house, found its way to the powder, and blew off the roof—and shattered the walls, and tore all the windows—and blackened the whole, as it was, when I saw it. Yes—it must have been powder—the lightning never produced such a change, so instantaneously. I sometimes met her as I walked, or rode—and now, and then, for a moment, at church; and once or twice, in the street, when we usually exchanged a few friendly inquiries, and parted: but one day—my blood boils at the recollection of it. I heard, in no gentle way, that I was mentioned as an old lover of hers—and, as being rather too intimate with her, after her marriage. I, a lover of hers!—Yes! I did love her, with all my heart, and all my soul—but she—the noble and beautiful woman, she never dreamt of my rashness, or presumption. But this was no tale to be told her by another. I went myself, therefore, to her home. I told her, as delicately, as I could, that I should see her no more. I dared not tell her why—I dared not. I am not the handsomest man in the world; and I should have trembled in the mild rebuke of her dark eye, had I uttered one word of myself. She was affected, even to tears—agitated, till, I had almost been obliged to support her with my arm—but no!—that might not be—she would sooner have died. No woman was ever truer to her allegiance — and then, at the most critical moment of my interview; when she had just communicated some story, that she had heard, repeatedly, about her husband, in a mysterious way—and that very day, in a letter, signed with my name, which she was so generous as to say, that she knew had never been written by me—detailing a shameful intrigue of her husband with a beautiful woman, of her acquaintance; when I had just bidden her to be comforted—for, though I had heard of the story, and knew the parties, the woman, in particular, in whom I had little confidence, yet that I would pledge life, and soul, upon his fidelity. I did not pretend, I said, to understand his motives for their long, and lonely conference together—but, be assured, said I, “he is never the man to keep any thing a secret from you—never the man to wrong you—no, never!” Just then the door opened, and her husband entered, pale as a dead man—faltering in his step. I was sitting upon one end of a large sofa; she, upon the other. We were both startled—and I—I hardly knew why, there was—I knew not wherefore, some feeling of guiltness, and consternation, about me, which I ought to have understood, and gone back to explain—but I did not—and left him, immediately, in a state of confusion, and perplexity, that I cannot describe, exchanging only a formal bow. There it ended—but I always comforted myself in the belief, that his wife had told him all that passed between us, at that time. I have reason now, to believe, that she did not—why, I do not pretend to say—but, whatever was her motive, she was wrong. Perhaps she misunderstood the nature of his jealousy; and, having gone one step in concealment, was obliged to go another; lest, by retracting, she should appear to make the first appear too serious a matter. Perhaps too, she had heard the same stories, that I had; but had too much respect for me; and too much value for her husband's life; a rash, headstrong man, at all times; but like the bruised lion, where his wife was named lightly, or irreverently—to risk our quarrelling. I am sorry that she knew me so ill. I would not have quarrelled with him—I would have told the whole truth; and then, if he could have shot me, he might. I should not have raised my hand. A long time after this, when I had nearly forgotten that there had been any ill blood between her husband and myself, I returned, unexpectedly, to the city, after a long absence, late one afternoon; I was to leave it again the next day, early, on a voyage for my health, that would prevent me from seeing the family again for many a month; perhaps for years—perhaps for ever. I could not bear to part with them—all the world to me—without one farewell. I went first to Mr. Adams' counting room; but he was abroad, and exceedingly busy, I found, in getting off a ship to Smyrna, and the East Indies. I went to every place, where I thought it possible to see him, until I thought it best to go, at once, to his own house, with the privilege of an old friend. I was shown up into the little parlour; the only small, comfortable room in the house; and found his wife romping with her boy. She was heartily glad to see me; and shook hands, cordially, with me—told me, what was true, that she had given up all hope of ever meeting me again. She spoke of her happiness; her unutterable happiness; her children, and her husband, as blessings, in some measure, for which she was indebted to me. She was eloquent; and, before I knew it, her little boy, whom I held in my arms—bawled out, vol. ii. E e that I was crying in his face. It was too true. I could not look upon that lovely, and high minded woman, without cursing myself, that I had been made so— hush! hush—my rebellious heart!—thy voice must not be heard in this council of death. Whether she read my thought, I know not; but, as I rose to go, she put her beautiful hand into mine, with great emotion, saying, “heaven bless, and protect you, noble minded man!” Could I do less—it was the only reward, that I ever coveted—I put my lips respectfully to her hand—but— I heard a suppressed breathing—I turned— There stood her husband, again!—there! like an apparition, before me. I knew not what devil possessed me. But I could neither stir hand, nor foot—nor utter a sound. The room grew suddenly dark—whirled round with me—and, if I recollect right, his wife fell upon a sofa, with a faint cry—just as I rushed into the street, like one stunned by some tremendous visitation. I walked, hurriedly, for a few squares, until I came to a full sense of my own folly, in having left the room—as I did. I determined then, to go back— but, on looking about me, I found, that I was far out of the city; and I hurried on, determined to call him out of bed, if there were no other way; and put his heart at rest, before I left him. But heaven had willed otherwise. In turning down a long street, after several hours of laborious travelling, I saw somebody hurrying across it, far below me, like a madman—my figure seemed to catch his eye, for he immediately stopped— it was all still as death; and, near where I stood, were three large trees, and a broad pavement. He came striding towards me—but so wild of mien; so altered in his voice, that I did not know him, till he had offered me a pistol. It was Adams, himself. I strove to soothe him. But he shut his lips, firmly; and looked like one, whom nothing, upon this earth could turn aside from blood. For the first time in all my life, my presence of mind deserted me. I ought to have leaped upon him, and disarmed him. I could have done it, I am sure. And, that I did it not, was not owing to any personal apprehension; but merely, heaven forgive me!—because I was really willing to die—weary of life. I know not how often he repeated the offer; but, I constantly refused it, until he hurled one of the weapons at my head, and shot away, with the other, a part of my right cheek; thereby adding, if it were possible, to the natural deformity of—poh—poh—let me not talk of myself. I fell—and thought that I felt the bullet pass through my head; and I was thankful for it; but, I still preserved my senses; and, after a little time, recovered. Reader! have you a heart of iron? If not, throw down the book. Would, that I had never promised to tell the tale!—But, the promise has been made, and shall be performed. If you have a heart of iron then, proceed. After a little inquiry, I found that Adams, who, we thought, for a time, had made away with himself, or been consumed in his own house—which the whole family left, that very night—and never entered again---even to take care of the furniture—stay---I am confounding dates, it was before the fire, that I was at the house—had probably, gone off, in his own ship; as she had sailed, that very night; and a boat had been seen waiting, at one of the wharves, till a late hour— and then, hurrying over the water, as if, for life and death. This hope kept his wife alive—and, this, alone. We dispatched two pilot boats after the ship; and, instead of going to the south of France, as I had determined, I wrote a note to his wife—for, I had determined never to see her again—telling her to keep up a stout heart; for, dead or alive, I would bring back her husband. God sustained her, for a while. She replied, at the end of three days; thanking me, and enclosing a letter for him, which I promised to deliver into his own hands. I saw, by the date of the note, that she was no longer at the country seat; and I rode out, to make some enquiry of the servants. By heaven, I cannot attempt to describe the awful and savage desolation of the place. The great front door was wide open—several of the windows—the entry strewed with the clothing of women and children—nay, the very candles and lamps were standing. I went through the house. Not a living creature could be seen—and there were no neighbours, nearer than the old man, of whom they had hired the house. I knew not what to do—it was enough to break my heart, to think of the family; and to look at the noble pictures—the rich furniture, that was left— all exposed to the depredation of the world. I locked all the rooms—fastened the windows, in the best way that I could; taking care to place every thing, precisely as I found it; even to the wine glasses, and cards, that were left upon a table, in one of the rooms, where, I suppose, that some neighbours had been playing whist, the night before—came away; and sent the keys to Mrs. Adams—Emma. The next morning, two hours before day, I set sail—after his own ship—for Smyrna. Three nights after, in a tremendous thunderstorm—the house was struck with lightning—but, from that day to this, I have never felt satisfied about it. There can be no doubt that the lightning struck it; because, it could be traced, when I returned, through one end of the roof; and, it is highly probable, that the whole was blown off, with gunpowder—but, what became of the old man? Nobody knew.—He had been seen, two days before, travelling, backward and forward, continually —night and day—with a covered wagon, loaded down; perhaps—it is possible—that he robbed the house; and then burnt it down, or blew it up—to conceal the robbery. I sailed, as I have said, and arrived at Smyrna; and, finally traced him to Constantinople—chiefly, by the beauty of his person; for, he was a man, to be distinguished, among ten thousand, by his lordly bearing;— and, after a search of six whole months, hearing of him, every now and then, among the Jews—Christians— Turks—and Greeks—I, at last, came upon him, all at once—when I had gone out, after the Greek manner, armed with two cimeters. This had well nigh been fatal to us. For a moment, I was a fool—a madman —and forgot all my errand—his blessed wife and children. But, heaven be praised! I prevailed at last; and, after a tempestuous voyage, during which, we were reduced to such misery, that we preyed upon each other; we arrived at Philadelphia, again. We were too late—too late—the angel was in her grave. Her boy had died, immediately after our departure; but, hope had buoyed up her heart. The mother was smitten to death; but the wife lived on; praying to her Maker, only to meet her dear husband once more; to meet, and return one kiss of forgiveness, and reconciliation;—and then, to die. She had no hope of life; no wish to live,—I heard the intelligence first—and I, it was, that would have told him the tale; but he spurned me from him; and, for a moment, I hardly pitied him—he had scorned even her letter; that, of which I would have let out my heart's blood; though, in his soul, I do know that he believed her innocent.—But—God smote him, to the brain. He maddened—and—farewell, reader, whoever thou art—farewell!—I shall only seal up her own letter, and add it to the bundle, just as it was written. She wrote it, upon her death bed. LETTER OF EMMA ADAMS, TO HER HUSBAND. (Enclosed.) O, my husband! my husband! what shall I say to thee!—I am blind, and sick, and desolate; and thou art far away!—William, my husband!—O, come back to me—Leister is sleeping in his little crib, at my side, but I—I cannot sleep. I never shall sleep again, William, if thou art not returned to me. Night after night, have I watched for thy tread;—night after night, overcome by drowsiness; and wet to the heart, with the tears of our child, I have sunk, for a single moment, into some terrible dream—fancied that we were restored to one another—that thy strong arm was about me —thy true heart beating against mine—and woke, with a shriek, that startled my poor boy; till, brave as he is, he would cower, and hide his little face and hands in my vol. ii.

      <field name="fulltext">POSTSCRIPT. It has been said of Randolph, that it contains too much private history. Ah!—how know the people that there is any private history in it? How came such private history to be so universally known. Again. A friend of the author has been asked, a hundred times, more or less, why certain anecdotes are mentioned in Randolph;—why he has let fall his iron retribution, with such tremendous power, upon the innocent and unoffending. Lo!—his answer. To those, who never heard any thing of these anecdotes, till they met with them in Randolph, they will have no significance---they will pass, for the invention of a Novel writer. But, if any man should understand them, it will be because he had heard them before---in some other shape---misrepresented, as a deadly slander; and here, he will learn the whole truth. A human creature, whose worst fault was, that, if he did wrong, no matter how secretly; no matter, how tempted or provoked---he could neither eat nor sleep, till he had confessed the wrong, and made atonement for it; he once told of a transgression, that no man knew; and prayed to be forgiven. What was the consequence? Apparent, and open-hearted forgiveness---but real hatred, and cowardly vengeance; unspeakable treachery and cruelty; while he was treated, to his face, like a man---and a good man. One of the many, who so treated him, went about, telling of him, confidentially, the most atrocious lies---lies, I say; because, although there might be some fact in them, yet, there were combined with it, so much falsehood, concealment, misrepresentation--- so much detestible malice and folly---perverse and wicked ingenuity---that the mind and heart of a great multitude, were secretly prejudiced against a comparatively innocent man, without giving him any reason, to imagine, or suspect the cause. The story never came to his ears—and how was he to contradict, or explain it? It came not to the ears of any intimate friend—for no man will venture to say that, to the intimate friend of another, which he would not say to that other, himself. Strangers could not be expected to tell him the tale; or to inquire into the truth of it. They heard it, confidentially. It was enough for them, to tell it, confidentially. But, one day—by a strange accident—the sufferer, himself, came to the knowledge of it. What did he? There were persons, whom he would not injure nor wound, for all that the world could give, so linked to the slanderer, that, if he suffered, they also would suffer. But then, how should he defend himself? He thought much of it—and, at last, came to a resolution:—there was no other way. He determined to write a book, which would only be understood for what it was, (a refutation of the vile and wicked calumny, which had been secretly poured, like a deadly poison, into the ears of society, and left to run through all the channels of life) by them, that had heard the calumny; and felt only by them, that had felt, or administered, the poison; while, to all the rest of the world, the book would pass for a novel—and the remedy, for a cordial. He did so. Do they complain that the story is known; that they, and theirs, are dying with shame and terrour. It is their own fault. Had they told nothing; or told, what they did tell, true or false, boldly, and like men— or told the whole truth, in any way, like men, or women; they never should have been punished; the thunder should not have fallen. Did they know the author of Randolph; and could they persuade themselves, that he would permit his name to go down to his children—or, to posterity—for they are all as children to him—so blackened and defaced. No—he has done righteously—and most righteous has been the retribution! The poison, like that poured into the ears of sleeping Denmark, was most deadly.— But, it was the nature of the remedy, to go only where the poison had been—was—or would be. What, then, if the blood vessels were ruptured—and the arteries exploded—and flashes of fire escaped in the conflict— what then?—it was not the fault of the physician. His remedy was innocent, except where it encountered the evil. Since Randolph has appeared, hundreds have confessed, that they had heard the wicked, sneaking fabrication, whispered about, in confidence, long and long before; and are perfectly thunderstruck at the truth.— And, but for Randolph, the injured man would never have known, nor suspected, the extent of his injury;— nor ever had an opportunity of confounding the slanderer. But enough. Let them that will, try the temper of their blades in this kind of warfare. The spirit of Randolph, whether he be dead or alive, will not abandon the undertaking; nor faint, nor rest, till he have rescued his own reputation, and put to shame the slanderers, for ever;—and, if there be no other way, he will publish their names, at full length, men, women, and children. That, I will promise, for him, and in his name. Editor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDITORIAL NOTICE. I make no apology for publishing, in a way, that I hope, will have a proper effect, the following remarkable letter; from a man, who has been challenged, as the author of Randolph; and publickly posted as a “CRAVEN,” “unpossessed of courage!” for not fighting in that character. I had heard the story a thousand times repeated, with every circumstance of aggravation, ridicule and infamy; before I arrived at the simple truth; and obtained a sight of the whole correspondence, between the parties; which, for the encouragement of all men, who have the great moral bravery, to deride the “world's dread laugh,” and set publick opinion, whenever it contradicts the judgment of their hearts, at open defiance, I have thought proper to publish. Mr. Neal seems to think, that it requires no great courage to refuse a challenge. But I think differently—nor, do I greatly approve of his pleasantry, in a matter of such solemn and universal concern, as this;—for, one is puzzled to know, whether he be in earnest, or not; whether he have refused to fight, from principle, fear; or, from singularity of temper. Much, therefore, of the good effect that might have been produced, by his refusal to fight, will, undoubtedly, be lost, while we are left to doubt of his motive. To one, who is, at this moment, the only man living, who knows the true author of Randolph, Logan and Seventy six, there would be something, in all this uproar and speculation, exceedingly amusing, were it not for the frightful interest that he, in common with all other men, who have the courage to think for themselves, begins to feel for the consequences of this duelling mania;—consequences, which must be fatal, to some one or more human beings, before this affair is at an end—unless every other man, to whom these works may be attributed, shall dare to do, as Mr. Neal has done—refuse to give the satisfaction of blood, —to anybody and everybody, who may choose to call him out—until he shall be shown to have done wrong—or, at least, to have done right, with a bad motive:—to have told what is false;—or, to have gone, without provocation, among the mighty of the land, living or dead; and arraigned them, like a sorcerer—in spite of themselves, for the amusement, hatred or derision of the world. No man; or rather, no writer—(for the author meddles with no men; but only with writers, and politicians, and painters; and criticks; and actors—and orators, and statesmen)—no writer is treated with more unsparing severity, than Mr. Neal, himself, by this formidable Randolph.— There is a cold, desperate carelessness;—a want of feeling, and common humanity; to say nothing of the wicked, heedless indifference and levity, and a bitter injustice, in the criticism upon Mr. Neal, which are not to be found in that upon any other writer mentioned in the work. Yet Mr. Neal is the first man, called upon to do battle for the book; although I took particular care to give the address of the author himself, at the endof Randolph; that all, who might complain of having been assailed by an assassin, might have an opportunity at least, of being heard;—and, although, no one has ever thought proper to avail himself, in the only way pointed out, of an opportunity for personal explanation, with the author, or with his friend. I did not say; and I do not say, that either the author of Randolph, “if living, and in this country,” or his friend, “if he should be absent, or dead,” will undertake to fight every man—right or wrong—with or without reason, who may choose to desire it, even through the channel pointed out. Nor, when he spoke of Mr. Pinkney's habit of, wiping his mouth on his cuff—or picking his nose, with his finger, in solemn argument; and said that he had seen it; and held himself answerable for what he said—did I understand him to mean that, whether true or false, he would fight any man that might happen not to have seen it. No—he meant what he said, that he would hold himself answerable for the truth of what he had written: and, if it were disputed, and he failed to prove it all—every tittle of it—then, and not till then, would be the time to fight. My opinion of the character is, that it is perfectly true—but then, the question is, whether the advantage is equal to the mischief of such truth —whether, what has been said, might not have been more gently said—particularly by such a man as Randolph, of such a man as William Pinkney—whom he speaks of, throughout, as a marvel, and a prodigy. However, not to take up the time of the reader, in the discussion of a law, which I despise and contemn, for its vol. ii. Ff absurdity—a code of honour, as it is called, made for the government of boys; and of them, that have not confidence in themselves;—and no other opportunity for distinction, or notoriety, rather, than that, which grows out of their own rash interpretation of it,—I will proceed to the correspondence itself; remarking, by the way, that, little disposed as I ever am to smile, in a question of bloodshed, I can hardly forbear, in this case, when I reflect upon the oddity and strange boldness of Mr. Neal's behaviour. Most men of his age, and standing, would consider themselves; and be considered by their fellow men, irretrievably, and perpetually disgraced, on having been posted for cowardice. Yet this man, sits down, deliberately, to aid the design of his mortal enemy; to perpetuate his own disgrace; and to make a circumstantial record of the whole transaction, which, if common men are to be believed, were enough to “consign a person to eternal infamy.” Really—if any thing, in this world, would tend to make the code of honour; and all its penalties, etiquette and sanction, supremely ridiculous, it is a course of conduct like this;—for, does it not show, that the man, who has been posted, does'nt care a fig for it?— Does it not show, that he is willing to abide all the consequences of it? Does he not multiply the copies, in a way, that the author of the hand-bill could never do—and give to them, a circulation, and durability, that may last; and, probably will last, as long as his own name; or the name of Pinkney, or Randolph, shall have a place in the memory of man. The following letter from Mr. Neal himself, will explain all the circumstances of the affair.—Editor. New-York, —. “Yes, my dear W—, it is all very true, I have been challenged and posted—challenged, as the author of that “execrable Randolph;” and posted as a “CRAVEN,” “unpossessed of courage,” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c: pretty much in the manner, that you have heard. It is not true, however, that I have been “whipped”—“cropped”—“horsewhipped”— “pulled”—“kicked”—“insulted”—“or shot.” Still, however, all that has happened to me, in the matter, I am willing to relate; first, however, calling your attention to the hand-bill below; that you may, if you can, puzzle out the meaning of it, as the people did here, after several days of unspeakable perplexity. I pray you to have it copied by the printers, in the very same type; word for word; and letter for letter—taking care to mark the size of the paper, by little dotted lines; and, having done that, I pray you to have it published, with my letter, at the fag end of the next work, that your friend — shall publish. By the way, that Errata, of his, so far as I have seen the proofs—I can make neither head nor tale of. It won't do—take my, word for it. Why does he not come out, with the last of the series—(I dare say, that the publick would be glad to see it)—and I, for my part, do not scruple to say, that it is worth all the rest of them, together; and that, if it be, as you tell me, the last, that the author did write—or that will ever be published of his—I do not doubt that he will find it so, not only in fame but profit. But, now for the “hand-bill.” (Here followed a little dirty bit of paper, in the following words—Ed.) The undersigned, (1) having entered into some correspondence with the reputed author of “Randolph;” who is, or is not. (2) sufficiently described as John Neal, a gentleman by indulgent courtesy;—informs honourable men, that he has found him unpossessed (3) of courage to make satisfaction for the insolence of his folly. (4) Stating thus much, the undersigned commits this Craven (5) to his infamy. (6) EDWARD C. PINKNEY. Baltimore, Oct. 11, 1823. (1) The undersigned—quite diplomatick. (2) That is—I have challenged John Neal, who is, or is not, the author of Randolph—because he is. (3) Beautifully expressed. How much more beautiful, and cautious, than to say—I found him without courage, or destitute of courage. (4) To be read either way—“insolence of his folly”—or “folly of his insolence.” (5) Craven—Blackstone—The young gentleman has read law, to great advantage. (6) Awful, to be sure—what will become of poor Mr. Neal, after that dooming, or consignment, rather.—Ed. Well—you have now read the mysterious paper, which you will perceive, by and by, was to be framed “in the worst terms, that contempt could devise!” What do you think of it? And now, for my account of the transaction. I shall be very particular—very—for, it were a thousand pities, that so complete a ceremony should not be circumstantially recorded, for the benefit of all who are so prone to valorous achievement—in time of peace—as are the junior population of our navy. Soon after the terrible book, “styled Randolph,” had appeared in this place;---while it was yet generally understood, and believed, to be made up of profanity, blasphemy, and obscenity;---and generally reported, on the best authority, that the author had denounced Jesus Christ, for a juggler---William Pinkney, for a blackguard---and George Washington, as no better than he should be:---while the whole town was ringing with a report, that the book had been suppressed, over, and over again; and that none of that class of men, so proverbial for their independence, and moral purity---and disinterstedness—and publick spirit--- and courage—called booksellers, would venture to touch it with a pair of tongs---a gentleman called upon me, late one afternoon, with the following very modest, and polite note. NO. I. “Sir: You are reputedly the author of a work, lately published, and styled Randolph; for this reason you will readily understand why the son of William Pinkney requires you to disavow unequivocally in writing, any agency in the publication of the work, in question. I await your answer. And am sir, very respectfully, &amp;c. EDW. C. PINKNEY. John Neal, Esq. Oct. 10, 1823. To this note, I replied, immediately, as follows---not a little amused, however, at the peremptory style; and unlucky phraseology of it; for, even if I had been the author of Randolph---it were a hundred to one, that I could have “disavowed”—“unequivocally”—“in writing”—(what) “all agency in the publication of it. But suppose that I could not disavow all agency in the publication of it---is that any reason, why I should stand up, and be shot at? Vol. ii. Ff 2. Nay, even if I had been the author---I should entertain very different notions of my accountability, to this young gentleman, than he, himself, would seem to entertain. I should say---“sir---what I have said, is true. It may have been harshly said---it may be misunderstood—but it was not said lightly; nor with a malicious intention; but from a sense of duty. Show me that it is not true; and then, I hold myself bound, as a man, to give you satisfaction, either by a publick retraction, of what I have said; or by giving you an opportunity to cut my throat.” But here, the utmost that could be said of us, had I fought Mr. P.— in justification of both—would have been, that I was accused —of having had some agency—in the publication of a book, the author of which entertained a different opinion—from Mr. Pinkney, the son of Mr. Pinkney—of the father. REPLY—NO. II. “Sir: “I do not admit the right of any man, whether he be the son of Mr. Pinkney, or not, to call upon me for an answer, either one way or the other, in the matter in question. I shall neither own, nor deny the authorship of Randolph, for the present, at least, whatever I may be disposed to do, hereafter. “However, I do not hesitate to say, that I have read the work in question; and that the portrait, of Mr. Pinkney, is altogether true, in its general features, according to my own observation; and that, if it be not so, there are enough to contradict the author, and confound him, whoever he may be. “Yours, with sincere respect, “JOHN NEAL. “Mr. Edw. C. Pinkney. “Balt. 10th Oct. 1823.” I had folded the preceding note; taken a copy; and was about to direct it; when the gentleman who brought it, desired permission to read it. I consented—and he, after declaring it not satisfactory, gave me another—without leaving my room—as follows:— NO. III. “Sir: “As you refuse to comply with my former demand, be pleased to make arrangements with my friend, for the alternative usual in such cases. It were well that they should be speedy. “I am, sir, “Very respectfully, “EDW. C. PINKNEY. “John Neal, Esq. “Oct. 10, 1823.” For a moment, I was a little angry, I confess. Mr. P. not having seen my reply, could not be considered as challenging me, for my own opinion of his father, as expressed in the note—and of course, if I fought, it must be (under that state of the affair) because I would not disavow all agency, in the publication of Randolph! That was devilish hard, I thought—it gave me no chance of backing out—by any sort of apology, or explanation—provided that I would'nt lie—and had been unlucky enough to correct a proof, or too, of Randolph; as I have, of twenty other works, that I never wrote. I desired a little time to reflect, before I replied to the challenge; mentioning that, if I did not fight, I should trouble a gentleman whom we both knew, to bear my answer: The friend of Mr. P. then left me, taking with him my reply, marked No. II. However, I soon made up my mind, without consulting anybody—and without much difficulty too, I confess—not to fight—and handed my answer, that evening, within half an hour, while the paroxysm of forbearance was at the height—to my friend, above alluded to; one of the best men that ever lived; wholly ignorant of duelling-etiquette— but full of true courage. These were my reasons, pro and con. It may amuse you, to know how I came to the conclusion. I must fight, because I am challenged. Being the challenged party, I can choose my weapons. I choose the small sword; with which, I have little to fear from any man living—in this country, certainly. The affair will make a noise—prevent others from challenging me; and I shall have the credit of introducing a far less bloody, and fatal mode of deciding personal controversies, than that of the pistol. On the other side, I asked, what I was going to fight for?—By fighting, I should countenance duelling—to which I was particularly averse, just at that time---acknowledge myself to be answerable for whatever there might be offensive, or foolish—or even misunderstood, in Randolph; and fifty people at least, would be obliged to challenge me, then—or be suspected of cowardice;—and I should be obliged to fight them all, one after the other; or be posted at last! Again.—However reluctantly, I might be compelled to run Mr. P. through the body, in self-defence—then, of course, I must run every one of his brothers through the body, as fast as they were old enough. Their brother's blood would cry to them, continually, from the ground. They would have to avenge his murder;--- and murder, it would be, in their eyes; and, probably, in those of the publick; who, in their sympathy with the family, would magnify my skill in the weapon, which I had chosen, a thousand fold; and his ignorance, in the same proportion. They would talk, too, of my age, and of his---of my temper, and of his;—and say, that he was a young man full of genius, and sensibility---a poet---an officer in the navy, which is, and ought to be our national boast---the only one of all the sons, unmarried, and at home, old enough to quarrel, in defence of their great father; and, that he was obliged, therefore, to call upon me for my disavowal; and that my answer was only intended to provoke him; and that, after he received it, he could do no otherwise, than challenge me---and that I ought never to have fought him. Now, all this would be exceedingly hard to bear---and not the less hard for being true;—nor the more easily born, because there might be blood upon my hands: or because I was not upheld by my own conviction of right; which alone would enable me to support all the rest. With it, I could bear any thing. Without it, nothing; whatever the world might say. Well, my friend delivered, for me, the following note— not, however, till the next day; having been unable to meet the party, to whom it was to be given, that evening; although he called for the purpose. NO. IV. “Sir: “Your last note would not seem to require much consideration; but I have given it a good deal; and my reply is, that I cannot accept a challenge, under the circumstances of this case, whatever I might do, where I held myself amenable to the laws of honour, or society, for any outrage upon either. “Yours, with respect, “JOHN NEAL. “Mr. Edw. C. Pinkney. “Balt. 10th Oct. 1823.” Now, I should not have scrupled, for a single moment, had I been called upon, in a less peremptory way, out of respect to the family; and to the afflicted sensibility of the son, whom, I really believe to be fashioned of excellent materials, to give him unquestionable proof of my veneration for the great industry, mind, and talent, of his dead father; nay, I would have taken some pains to convince him, that no man would sooner uplift an arm, in defence of all that ought to be defended, in his memory, than I, myself; I should have said—“Sir, it matters not, whether I am, or am not the author of Randolph. Publick men are publick property. I only say, that, if I were the son of Mr. Pinkney, I would thank the man that drew his character, in that book; for, no man ever spoke so highly; or so much to the purpose, of his august intellect; and I would have forgiven him, at least, if I did not thank him, for any harsh or careless phraseology, when I found, what is the truth, that it had no application, to any thing but the outward manner and appearance of Mr. Pinkney—none to his moral or private character; (for which, by the way, he ought to thank me;) but, was altogether confined to his publick and manifest one.” But, be that as it may; I neither said, nor meant to say anything at that time, after being so called upon, to appease the exasperated young man; and, the next day, I received the following note; which, but for the threat in it, would have produced from me, all that Mr. P. could have desired. No. V. “Sir: “I have received your singular answer to my note. Reconsider its subject—and write more to my satisfaction before the evening, or I will post you, in the worst terms that contempt can devise. I am, &amp;c. EDW. C. PINKNEY. To John Neal, Esq. Oct. 11, 1823. To this note, I made no reply—except, by desiring my friend, verbally, to say that I had no answer to make to it. He did so, after suggesting a more conciliatory course, which I could not accede to, on the same morning, (Saturday, 11th Oct.) That day, and the next, the publick excitement was at the height. Nobody had read the book. Yet, all pretended to talk about it. At last, a few copies got abroad; and men began to look about them, and ask each other, what I had been challenged for. On the Monday following, the threat was accomplished. A multitude of little hand bills, of which this, which I send to you, is a true copy, were scattered in every direction. Yet, was it with the greatest difficulty that I could get a sight of one; this, which I have here, we ought to preserve, as a literary curiosity. One week, only, has passed; and there is not a copy to be had, for love or money—nay, before the sun had gone down, on that very day, it was almost impossible to find one—so that, Mr. Edward C. Pinkney may thank me, for giving effect, to his own mode of punishment. It would be not a little amusing, if people should, hereafter, have to turn to Randolph, to know, who Mr. Pinkney was—to that very Randolph, as the only record; or the best record of Mr. Pinkney the father; or of Mr Pinkney the son.[17] [17] I take it for granted that Errata will appear next; in which case, the son may be indebted to that, for all that will be known of him. And yet, I have no doubt that it will be so. The father, great as he was, has left nothing behind him, worthy of his power; for, all his cotemporaries have gone; or are going, one after the other, into their graves; so that, by the end of another year, he will only be known, through the magnifying mist, and obscurity of tradition. And the son, unless he be a wiser man than his father; and a more provident one, whatever may be his future reputation, will leave nothing behind him, so permanent as these very works, which are so scouted and denounced. The truth is, if it must be told, that it is on my own account—not on his—that I preserve this account of my own infamy. I expected better things of the young man, than such a “nasty lame and impotent conclusion;” such a childish catastrophe. I had seen some very pretty poetry of his; I had heard that he was ambitious, melancholy, proud, singular, and full of sensibility; on which account, I could forgive a fellow, for any thing; that he had fought two or three duels—and written two or three songs—all which, in our present state of society, would be likely to make a man very terrible, and very interesting—to the ladies; and, therefore, I looked for a hand-bill, that would make my blood thrill and tingle; and my teeth chatter, to the twentieth generation, at least. But why tell of such an affair. Mr. P. is a man of genius; and, for that very reason, I should have looked for something, exceedingly like rigmarole, in a case, where the best writer, in our language, must have been puzzled, to justify himself for posting me. One word, however, of the book. I do not blame Mr. Pinkney much; but I do blame the man[18] [18] A man, however, to whom the author of Randolph owes an apology, which he ought not to be excused from making, by any conduct of the man, himself. He is mentioned in Randolph;—an honour, to which nothing, that he ever did, said, or thought, would entitle him —but in a manner, totally unworthy of Randolph, himself, and the story, I have reason to believe, is not strictly true, that is told of him there. who sent the book to him, at a time, when the whole city was in an uproar, with the offensive passages marked. What might have been the consequences, had I not been a coward; not only to Mr. P. and myself, but to our families, I leave to him to—imagine, and reflect upon. God forgive him, for hazarding what he did! There was hardly any choice left to Mr. P.---a son ---a poet---an officer in the navy—at his age---after having the book thrust upon him, in that way; and nobody had a right to expect that I would not fight. Let him reflect that, what Mr. P. might have passed over, had he been older and wiser; or, had he read the whole character alone, deliberately, he could not but madden over, when called upon, almost by acclamation, to fight the reputed author; and when obtruded upon, by the impertinent sympathy of a man, whose commiseration, in any case, ought to be regarded as a mortal affront. Left to himself, I have such an opinion of his good sense; and of his veneration for his father, as to believe that he would have deliberated a good while, before he risked the shedding of a man's blood, who had only been suspected, of having called his father, a giant. People pretend—ministers of the gospel, and religious people—that it requires a great deal of courage to refuse a challenge. They are mistaken. I did'nt find it so. They say, too, that few men have the nerve, to bear being posted. Poh!—I found it a very easy matter. It never gave me any trouble. And, to encourage other men to depend upon their own hearts, and heads, in all like cases, rather than upon what, they may believe to be the publick sentiment, I would merely mention to them, that, before a week had passed, it would have been exceedingly difficult to find a respectable man in the whole city of Baltimore, who did not justify me, for refusing to fight; whatever he might have thought of Randolph. It is a remarkable case, I admit. I never knew one like it. Let a man have refused to accept a challenge—in any case, that I have ever known; or heard of; and there were always people enough to blame him; or to call him a coward; whether they understood the reason of his refusal, or not; but, in this case, there really seems to be but one opinion—and that is altogether in my favour, so far as it regards the duel; unpopular as I am, and hope to remain. It was the object of Mr. P. of course, to bring the matter to issue before a military tribunal, where the lex non scripta of chivalry, would be expounded, according to the sensibility, and passion, of each and every one of the judges. For the very same reason, it was to my interest, to bring it before a literary tribunal, where I should not tremble to encounter any man, I care not whom, with the consecrated weapon of the court—a pen; but I waved that right, and have even put aside all my privilege, as a lawyer, to bring the question into another court,[19] [19] Sending a challenge, in Maryland, has been a disabling offence, by statute. I had the same right to bring him before a court of justice; that he had to bring me before a court of honour; and more power— for he, I am told, is a student at law. which would be emphatically mine, for the same reason that a court of honour would be his; and, finally, have brought it, in this formal shape, before the common superiour of both him, and myself—PUBLICK OPINION; protesting, by the way, that I shall have no sort of respect for its decision, if it do not sanction my conduct; and not much more, if it do; for what can the publick know of my true motive, for not spilling this man's blood; and it is the motive alone—which cannot be known, but to my Maker—that I ought to be judged by; and that I shall be judged by, after all. For nearly ten years, I have been trying to establish a tribunal, for my own comfort, superiour to that of publick opinion. I have hazarded every thing in the experiment; and, at last, so far as it concerns my own conduct—in my own view—I have succeeded. I never trouble myself, now, about what other men would do; or what they would not do; or what they would expect me to do, in any given case. I merely do, what I, myself, hold to be right. I may be mistaken in my judgment; and I am, undoubtedly, in many cases; but that is not my fault. Among other matters, up on which I have determined to do—as I please—is that of fighting duels. I will not fight, because I am challenged; I will not fight, because another may choose it; but, if I fight, at all, it shall be, because I choose it. Luckily for me, I have the choice of alternatives, to a greater degree, than most men. I can talk as loud as another. I can write as boldly; and as effectually. I have no fear of personal chastisement, in any way, from any man; and I am not of a temper to put up with any insult. Should I abandon all these means of defence, at once—and go out to combat, with arms, to which I am less accustomed, merely because the opinion of a foolish mob may require it; or the passions of a foolish boy—goaded on by meddling coxcombs —ambitious of distinction, in any way; and a slave to his education, may lead him in my way. Really, it were about as ridiculous a piece of magnanimity, for a good shot with a pistol, to go blindfolded in the field; or, for a fine swordsman to fight with ramrods, in obedience to fashion. No— I shall do no such thing. I shall defend myself with the weapons to which I am most accustomed—my tongue, pen, fist, or sword, as may best please me; trusting to Him, that hath armed and endowed me; and careless of the consequences, whatever they may be, so long as I am supported by my own approbation. I have heard a great deal of blustering, in one way and another, about this novel; and not a few second hand threats of personal chastisement, have occasionally come to my ears, accompanied with many a hint to keep close; or, at least, to arm myself: but no man has yet been fool hardy enough to attempt any thing of the sort, although I have put myself, repeatedly, in the way of several, who, I had been told, were determined to “make an example of me;” although I have gone about, and shall continue to go, much more than I ever have before—unarmed and alone[20] [20] Till this foolish uproar—I used to carry a sword-cane—no matter why—it was not from fear.—I threw it aside, immediately. Till then, I was hardly ever seen at a publick place; or in the street, alone.— Since then, I have made it a point to go alone—to every publick place—sometimes, to two or three, on the same evening;—to keep in the street continually—and without any companion. I mention these things, partly by way of boasting—and, partly, in justice to myself; because a multitude of lies have been told about the matter—not in Baltimore—for here, they would not be believed—but in other parts of our country. -where-ever it is most likely, that such an attempt may be made. vol. ii. Gg I do not invite it—but, I cannot say that I wish to avoid it, even though it may be made by giants, or armed ruffians;— and, if it should happen, I promise them that know me— with the blessing of God—to leave an example, whatever may be the consequences---though my adversaries may be twice my size, and cased in armour---that shall go far to discourage all men from any repetition of the outrage. I would recommend, however, to all those, whose friends are kind enough to see allusions to, and likeness of them, in Randolph—to look them in the face, and ask them, how they dare to see any thing of the sort, unless it be quite too plain for dispute. For myself, I am perfectly sure, that the author of Randolph never heard a syllable of many stories, and adventures, which, it is now said, that, he has a particular reference to. Nay—I go further. I say, at once, that whoever he may be, he is too formidable, and too generous, to hunt such small game, as are continually affecting, of late, to be run out of breath, by him. I say, moreover, that he is precisely the man, that is wanted for this age; and this people—with all his faults, and all his follies:— having both the moral courage, and the talent, to tell the truth, so that men will remember it, in spite of their teeth; and that, therefore, he has no more right, than have our Judges or Senators; or any other minister of justice, necessary to this people and time, to go out into the field of battle, and be shot at, like an ordinary man. His country has a claim upon him; and if he be yet alive, it is a solemn duty on his part, to keep himself beyond the reach of any thing, that may prevent him from obeying her call, whenever it may be; or, whatever it may be. But no matter for him. There will be, of course, different opinions of me; and of my motive, for refusing to fight. Most men will attribute it to cowardice—a very few, to principle—some to obstinacy—and some to affectation, or singularity. And there is one man, who knows me well, and has known me for many years: who will say that I have done this thing, merely because nobody else would, or could have done it; because I knew that, if I did'nt fight, more noise would be made about it, than if I did—and, merely to baffle all calculation concerning me; for, he is one of those, who take it for granted that, whatever no other man would do, right or wrong, that would I do, in any given case: and one of those, who say that “I will do, what I think right—and will not do, what I think wrong---but then, the devil of it is, that I have false notions of right and wrong!” —alas! if that be true, whose fault is it---mine or my Maker? Let every man do the like; and we shall have much less trouble in this world. There---good by'e. A friend of mine predicts, that I shall be elected honorary member of every Peace Society in the country;---and really, if the truth must be told---I cannot help saying that, in my own opinion, I deserve to be canonized, at least, in this age of duelling. Yours, most heartily, my dear W—. JOHN NEAL. Baltimore, 14th Oct. 1823. P. S. I wonder that Mr. John E. Hall has not challenged me, since I have been posted for a coward. But, I take it for granted, that he has not heard of it, yet;---or that, he still entertains a doubt on the subject of my cowardice. I am told by a man, who knows him well, that I may depend upon a challenge, whenever he shall come to be satisfied, that I won't fight. J N.</field>
