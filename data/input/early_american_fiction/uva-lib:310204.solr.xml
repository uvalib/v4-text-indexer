      <field name="fulltext">Southern District of New-York, ss. (L.S.) Be it remembered, that on the tenth day of June, in the fortieth year of the Independence of the United States of America, Charles N. Baldwin, of the said district, hath deposited in this office the title of a book the right whereof he claims as proprietor, in the words and figures following, to wit: “The Champions of Freedom, or the Mysterious Chief, a Romance of the Nineteenth Century; founded on the Events of the War between the United States and Great-Britain, which terminated in March, 1815. By Samuel Woodworth. “Miracles our Champions wrought, Who their daring deeds shall tell? O, how gloriously they fought! How triumphantly they fell!” —Montgomery. In conformity to the Act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, “An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the time therein mentioned.” And also to an Act entitled “An Act, Supplementary to an Act, entitled `An Act for the Encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned,' and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.” THERON RUDD, Clerk of the Southern District of New-York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. “And what do you think of it?” asked I, as my classical friend entered the room where I was writing. I knew his errand without raising my eyes. “Think of it!” exclaimed he, in a tone that expressed more contempt than anger—“I think that you had better burn it than print it.” So saying, he threw down the manuscript of the first volume, and took a seat by the table. I confess that I felt a little disconcerted, and, without venturing to meet his eye, I laid down my pen, and began carelessly to turn over the leaves of the unfortunate manuscript. After a disagreeable silence of three minutes, he added—“Burn it, and save your reputation.” Thinks I to myself, there is no flattery in all this, at any rate; and after some hesitation, I requested him to point out the faults he had discovered. “It is all a fault,” answered he, “from beginning to end. The grand fundamental rule of composition is violated in every chapter. It is a literary monster.” “The very thing I aimed at,” exclaimed I, with affected composure; for at that moment a little devil called Obstinacy, popped into my bosom, and I felt determined to justify my bantling, right or wrong. “Monsters are the only animals that meet encouragement in this age of refinement. But which do you consider the most prominent feature in my monster?” “It is all monstrous,” he replied; “the plot is unnatural, the incidents absurd, and the language inelegant. But the greatest monster of all is your Mysterious Chief.” “The absurdity of the incidents must not be imputed to me,” said I; “they are all copied from life—most of them are historically correct.” “So much the worse! the mixture of truth and fiction is the very thing that constitutes a literary monster. Horace says”— “A fig for Horace! Who authorised him to lay down rules for me? My sole end and aim has been to produce a work of my own; and the more it differs from any thing that has ever preceded it, so much the better have I succeeded in the attempt.” “Give me leave to tell you, sir,” replied my friend, very gravely, “that the present age is too enlightened to swallow such stuff as is written in those pages. The great majority of mankind have discarded such false and super-stitious ideas; and true philosophy not only teaches us that they are absurd, but that the occurrence of such incidents as they are predicated on is absolutely impossible. Depend upon it, your work is damned.” “It is very possible that majorities may be wrong,” I replied; “nay, both revelation and history assure us that a great majority of mankind always have been wrong. It is, also, very possible, that what some learned men term the light of true philosophy, may only be an ignis fatuus. Such, in my opinion, is every light that is not kindled at the fountain of light—the great luminary of revelation. If I differ in opinion from all the world, there can be no unpropriety in expressing that opinion—none in maintaining it, until my understanding is convinced of the error. Want of knowledge is more excusable than want of sincerity.” “But pray, sir, be so good as to explain the design of this work. What useful end can possibly be attained by its publication?” “This advertisement,” I replied, “is a ready answer to your question. With your permission I will read it. “ADVERTISEMENT. “The grand object intended by the work here announced to the public, is a monument of American patriotism and bravery, embellished with a picture of those humbler virtues, which, though not so dazzling to the imagination, are not the less honorable to human nature and our national character. “It is admitted that the late brilliant achievements of our heroic countrymen, like those of their forefathers, are already inscribed on imperishable columns of Naval and Military glory; and so long as the Atlantic rolls, the Mississippi flows, or the Niagara thunders down its rocky precipice, so long shall their names and valorous deeds be united in the grateful remembrance of admiring posterity. But the untempered lustre of martial glory will often dazzle until it pains; and a continued series of warlike achievements, however brilliant in their nature, or important in their effects, soon becomes (to many readers) a disagreeable and tiresome monotony; they gaze awhile with wonder and admiration, until, stunned with the din, they hasten from the scene, and seek relief in the more placid enjoyments of peaceful pursuits and rural occupations; or in the contemplation of love, friendship, and the arts. “To furnish this relief without alluring from the subject—to soften the rough notes of the bugle by the gentler tones of the lyre—to mingle the flowers of fancy with the laurels of victory—and to shift the scene occasionally from the hostile camp to the mansion of love, has been the author's aim in the projected work, and he trusts that the attempt has not been entirely unsuccessful. To this end, many private events have been interwoven with the thread of public history; without, however, once losing sight of the direct line of chronology, which has ever been carefully kept in view throughout the work. This pertinacity in adhering to matters of fact, combined with the very nature of the subject, has introduced more agents on the stage than would be welcome or admissible in a work of mere imagination. But this will be pardoned by the candid reader, on the grounds just premised, viz. the impossibility of avoiding it without a violation of fact. “Although termed a Romance, and embellished with a few fictitious scenes, incidents, and characters, it will, nevertheless, be the most correct and complete History of the recent War, that has yet appeared. Every event of importance will here be found detailed in order; and all those who, by their courage, enterprise, or success, (whether on ocean, lake, or land) have contributed to the interest of these events, will here receive every notice their ambition can wish—every respect their services merit. “On the whole, it is believed that this work will be found equally interesting, as a history or a novel; and the lovers of each will find themselves pleasantly led from one to another of their own favorite scenes, without a very wearisome march through those of their opponents in taste.” The moment I had finished, my friend exclaimed, “But why introduce any thing supernatural? Is that necessary to your plot?” “Just as necessary,” I replied, “as a tail to a devil.” “How! explain yourself.” “A short story will do it. An opulent old nobleman in France, whose picture-gallery was richly decorated with scenes from Milton's Paradise Lost, offered a prize-medal of princely value, to the artist who should produce the best painting of Satan's Journey through Chaos, when —“eagerly the fiend, “O'er bog, or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, “With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursu'd his way.” “The successful candidate for this glittering prize was a poor painter of Laon, whose professional exercises had always been confined to the humbler essays of lettering a sign, or painting a flower-de-luce on the knapsacks of the French infantry. Fired by a sudden blaze of heaven-born genius, he now grasped the palet, and many were the days and nights he passed in sleepless industry, plying his brush, while his family were starving. At length the fallen angel rose upon his enraptured view, tugging his arduous way through realms of blackets night; “Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, “Half flying.” “When the piece was finished, the exulting painter called in his friends to witness his success, and begged each one to express his opinion of the performance, and point out any imperfections they might discover, as he had yet several weeks before him, in which he could make improvements. Learned or unlearned, critics are all alike. One found fault with the drapery, another with the fiend, and a third with both. The lamplighter thought chaos was unnaturally dark; the printer objected to the devil's size, and the tailor disliked the set of his mail: while the blacksmith insisted that the mouth of hell ought to blaze in the distance. All could discover faults, but no one could see the same. “It now only remained for the curate to give his opinion, who, after examining the piece very critically, unfortunately discovered that the three distinguishing characteristics of a true devil were wanting—the horns, tail, and much-celebrated cloven-foot. The whole body of assembled critics now stood aghast, staring at each other in mute astonishment, while the sagacious curate strutted about with no little importance. The painter, however, (like some authors) was obstinate, and insisted that the most modern and fashionable devils differed very little from men, and that the appendages mentioned by the curate had long been out of vogue. The curate expostulated, and the painter insisted; the one quoted Latin, and the other quoted Milton; the curate spoke of heresy, and the painter began to yield, and at length proposed a compromise which he expressed in the following words: “`I agree with monsieur Curate in part. The cloven foot and the horns may be proper; but for the tail, I will never give up.' “`Well, since I have furnished you with another week's work,' replied the triumphant curate, `I will now take my leave; when you have finished the horns and the foot, I will undertake to convince you of the impropriety, nay, the absolute impiety, of omitting the tail.' “`Stay a moment,' answered the painter. `The horns and the foot are already formed.' “`Where are they?' “`The former are concealed by the helmet, and the latter is behind that sulphurous cloud. But never talk to me about the tail.' “`Madman!' exclaimed the zealous churchman, vexed at such want of orthodoxy in his opponent—`why, all the world, both clergy and laity, have agreed that the devil has a tail; and without one yours will be condemned and rejected.' “`All the world,' the painter coolly replied, `both clergy and laity, are perfectly welcome to their opinion. This painting shall not be altered; and if all the world reject the devil, we can do without clergymen.” My friend offered no comment, but immediately took his leave, as I shall do, after dropping A WORD TO THE READER. The Champions of Freedom cannot fail of being patronised by Americans, even though dressed in home-spun uniform, coarse and inelegant. It is of domestic manufacture, and cannot displease the eye of a patriot. In the Mysterious Chief you may possibly recognise an old acquaintance; if not, you will gain a new one, and will never repent his introduction. I could enumerate many faults that will be readily discovered in this work; but they are principally such as could not be avoided without altering the plan. I have dared a bold flight in a new and untried region, in which “success would have been immortality”—let the failure be consecrated by the attempt. With regard to the execution of my plan, I have little to say. It is my first attempt, and I have done the best I could. In many respects I have studied the interest of the reader alone, by making short paragraphs, and lessening the length of a chapter when its subject is dull, and increasing it when the incidents are interesting. For the biographical facts interspersed throughout the work, I most gratefully acknowledge that I am indebted to two of the first literary publications in this country— the Port Folio and the Analectic Magazine. I feel it my duty to add, that the songs introduced into the work, were set to music while it was in press, and may be obtained of my very excellent friend, Mr. E. Riley, music seller, in Chatham-street. I will here take my leave of the reader, with two lines that I designed as a motto for the title-page—but which may not be amiss here: Show here a vicious thought, however brief, A thought immoral—and I'll tear the leaf.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 CHAPTER I. A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE. —At sixteen years, When he might act the woman in the scene, He proved best man i' the field, and for his mede Was brow-bound with the oak. Shakspeare. AMONG the early champions of American freedom, few, perhaps, bore arms with more honor to themselves or success to the glorious cause, than Major Willoughby. He was the only son of the most opulent farmer in the state of Massachusetts, who designed his son for the study and practice of the law. But while he was preparing for an admittance into Harvard University, the plains of Lexington were wet with the blood of his countrymen. Adieu, now, to the peaceful pursuits of literature. The soul of young Willoughby was in arms; and all the youth of his standing were flying to the revolutionary standard. Some obtained commissions; but he was of too impatient a temper to await the dull formula of an application, and the uncertainty of its success. He therefore endeavored to raise and equip a volunteer corps at his own expense; but failing, from youth and inexperience, in that laudable attempt, he determined to enter the provincial army as a private. His father was strongly opposed to this step, and the tears of his mother for some time deferred its execution. After a long and severe struggle, however, between filial affection and a romantic enthusiasm for arms, the latter obtained the ascendency; and, in the following year, he joined the American standard at Kingsbridge, a few days before the battle of White Plains. But the keen discernment of the immortal Washington did not long permit his ardor to burn in obscurity. Having, fortuitously, drawn him from the ranks to supply some temporary vacancy in his personal suite, he thought he perceived in the young recruit, merits too promising to remain shrouded by his present situation, and powers of action which only wanted a theatre for their display, and encouragement for their success. A closer inspection soon determined him to cultivate the seeds of future greatness which he was convinced he had discovered in the gallant youth; and, with this end in view, seized every occasion of drawing forth those latent talents for usefulness, which might otherwise have been lost to his country and unprofitable to their possessor. The battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, and Germantown, together with many subsequent events of minor consequence, so firmly established this favorable opinion, and did such ample justice to the penetration of his chief, that in little more than one year from the period of his enrolment, the fortunate Willoughby wore an epaulet, and on the receipt of his commission from Congress, it was presented him by his commander in chief, accompanied with an elegant sword as a testimony of the general's personal esteem. The flame, long smothered, now burst forth without restraint. Placed by the hand of friendship in the path of glory, Willoughby determined to reach the dazzling goal, or perish in the race. With the sword of Washington in his hand, he resolved to carve himself a name, or leave one behind him written with his blood. Opportunities soon occurred, and were met by him with so much bravery and address, that in less than two years from his promotion, this young soldier of fortune was brevetted a major, and his name enrolled on the journal of Congress. He was now but twenty-two years of age, and had attained to the summit of his youthful ambition. Honored with the public notice, and blest with the private friendship of the first of men, he felt his bosom glow with the most unbounded gratitude to Heaven and his noble patron; and in the enthusiasm of his feelings, he vowed to devote his future life and services to Freedom and Washington. To keep this vow in constant remembrance, he had his sword fancifully inscribed with the following motto: “My God, my Country, and Washington;” and on the reverse—“Never surrendered but with life.” The confidence of his general was not misplaced; for the breast of Willoughby was the seat of honor and every noble virtue. In the unfortunate battle of Camden, which soon after occurred, he added new laurels to the blooming chaplet that already encircled his temples; but was there disabled by a wound which for some time deprived his country of his useful services. At the opening of the campaign in the following year, however, he was so far recovered as again to take the field, and at Yorktown his skill and gallantry were so eminently displayed, that no small share of that day's glory was attributed to himself. Attached to the person of Washington by the strong ties of gratitude and veneration, he looked forward to a separation as the most unpleasant occurrence that he could ever encounter; and the glorious peace of 1783, the long-looked-for reward of all their toils and sufferings— the great object of all their arduous struggles and distressing privations, was embittered to the grateful Willoughby by the event he so much deprecated. The army was disbanded, and the hero who had a crown within his reach and a sceptre at his command, resigned them both into the hands of his legitimate sovereign—The People, and retired, like Cincinuatus, from the camp to the plough. The major could not accompany him in his retirement, though earnestly solicited; for the recent death of his father, and the unsettled condition of his estate, imperiously demanded his presence and attention in the state of Massachusetts, whither he immediately repaired, after taking an affectionate leave of his friend and 2* benefactor, the Champion of Freedom, the friend of mankind. During the happy months of the succeeding autumn, Willoughby was united in marriage to the amiable Miss Cushing, a near relative of the Hon. William Cushing, of Scituate, in the county of Plymouth; and two purer souls, more congenial in sentiment, or more ardent in affection, never interchanged their faith at the hymenial shrine. Nearly of the same age, and brought up from childhood together, reciprocal affection had, almost imperceptibly, united their hearts; and sympathy of taste, virtue, and mutual tenderness, gradually mingled their spirits, and made them entirely one. If any event was now wanting to complete his earthly happiness, it was that which occurred in the following summer, when his beloved Amelia presented him with an infant daughter. This was a new source of untasted delight, and while the happy father received this dear pledge of their mutual love in his arms, he silently ejaculated his most fervent thanks to the Great Author of every good. Days, months, and years of happiness rolled on, and three daughters were the fruits of their nuptials. It shall not be insisted that the acquisition of a son would not have tended to heighten their felicity, but if that reflection ever drew a sigh from either bosom, it was never breathed to the ear of the other. They felt too much gratitude for the blessings which Providence had bestowed, to murmur for those which he saw good to withhold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. THE SPEAKING CORPSE. This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes. Shakspeare. Major Willoughby had been frequently solicited to accept of some civil office in his native state, but always declined the proposal as incongenial to his more active disposition. But in the year 1790, when the Indians of the southwestern frontier resumed the hatchet and the scalping knife, and commenced their desolating incursions among our back settlements, he again buckled on the cuiras, and braved the dangers of the western wilderness against these unprincipled savages. But the Sword of Washington was on his thigh, which, in his romantic imagination, was a talisman more potent than any recorded in the fables of antiquity. But he had not now to contend with an honorable magnanimous enemy, but to cope with foes more ferocious than the panthers that prowled their forests, more subtle than the serpents which infested their morasses. A battle was fought in the winter following, in which the Americans gained nothing but honorable wounds, and suffered the loss of near seven hundred of their bravest troops. Willoughby was wounded, and General St. Clair very narrowly escaped destruction. Many skirmishes, much hardships, and little success attended their subsequent campaigns, until the year 1794, when, on the twentieth of August, under the gallant Wayne, they obtained a complete and decisive victory, near the rapids of the Miami, where the Indians were totally defeated, and the foundation laid of a safe and durable peace. Previous to this important event, Willoughby had lost a friend to whom he was very strongly attached, in the death of Robert Elliott. This gentleman was unfortunately slain near the Muskingum river, by a party of hostile Indians, while he was conducting the necessary supplies for the American army. This melancholy event cast a peculiar gloom over the mind of Willoughby, and it was some time before he recovered his wonted cheerfulness. On the morning of the twentieth of August, he felt unusually dejected, and never had entered an action with such depression of spirits and gloomy forebodings, as now hung about him. His personal courage had not deserted him, but he felt sensations which he could neither account for nor describe. Something seemed to impress him with the idea that some heavy disaster was impending over him, and that he should never again embrace his dear Amelia, or kiss his prattling babes. It was now five months since he had left them on the present campaign, and nearly two since he had received a letter from his wife. If he should fall in the approaching contest, it would afford her some consolation to receive his last farewell. He therefore seized a pencil and hastily wrote a few tender lines, bidding Amelia and her children an affectionate adieu, which he directed to be dispatched by express, should the event prove fatal to himself; then breathing a silent but fervent prayer for the safety and happiness of his family, he was in a moment ready for the field. “My God, my Country, and Washington!” he exclaimed as he drew his well-tried sword, and Willoughby “was himself again.” In the hottest of the engagement, while hatchets, swords and bayonets were clashing in dreadful response to the hellish yells of the savages, the right hand of Willoughby was pierced by an arrow, and the sword of Washington fell from his grasp. He had scarcely regained it when the stroke of a tomahawk severed the same hand from his wrist. In this situation, unable to retreat, he fought with his left hand, until fainting with loss of blood, he was carried from the field. In the mean time the enemy were routed, and the victory decided. “O that I had a son!” exclaimed Willoughby when the surgeon had finished dressing his wound, “O that I had a son to inherit this sword, since I can no more wield it myself. Had I but one son to give my country in my room. I would swear never to repine at this misfortune, or any other that may befal me. I had bound myself by a most solemn vow, never to relinquish this weapon but with life, and twice, this ill-omened day, has it been struck from my hand by a savage. O that I had a son to redeem my vow.” “You have a son!” murmured a voice in a low, but very distinct accent. Every eye was directed to the spot, where lay the lifeless body of a Miami Chief, who had fallen early in the action. The anguish of Willoughby's wound was now almost forgotten in the amazement that absorbed his every faculty, and all present exhibited signs of the most unaffected astonishment. Each one was well convinced that there was neither life nor motion in the gigantic form before them; and that the words proceeded from no other source, they were, however reluctantly, compelled to believe. If any doubts existed on that point, they were instantly removed; for the same words were repeated, almost in the ear of an officer who was stooping to examine the corpse, and yet sufficiently audible and articulate for every one present to hear and understand: “You have a son, to redeem your vow.” More than eight hundred miles from the field of battle, at that moment, the wife of Willoughby was delivered of an infant. He was, at length, blest with a son! Blest, did I say? It was a blessing purchased at a dreadful price, to have redeemed which, he would have been willing to relinquish son, daughters, fortune, fame, and all. Amelia expired in giving it birth! Happy for Willoughby he did not learn the dreadful truth until his health was in a great degree restored. Few men had loved like him—few men ever experienced anguish like his. A very natural curiosity in those who witnessed the foregoing phenomenon, induced a most critical contemplation of this oracular corpse. And here a new source of surprise and admiration presented itself. More symmetry of form, regularity of features, and dignity of countenance, were never united in man. The prowess of Hercules appeared combined with the graces of Adonis. His death-wound was directly through his heart, and made by a rifle ball: but no distortion of feature was visible in his aspect; and nothing like ferocity had shaded the placidity of his brow. His eyes were closed as in a pleasant sleep, and every muscle composed in majestic serenity. His hatchet lay by his side, and he had a dagger in his girdle of wampum. But who he was, remained an impenetrable mystery. Several prisoners were brought to examine him, but neither of them would acknowledge that he knew him, although his countenance was one of those which can never be forgotten. Previous to his being removed from the spot where he fell, an expert artist, belonging to the regiment, took a faithful copy of this interesting figure, painted at full length, which he presented to Major Willoughby on the termination of the campaign.</field>

Thompson. —The man that consecrates his hours By vigorous effort, and an honest aim, At once extracts the sting of time and death; He walks with nature, and her paths are peace. Young. Many lingering months rolled heavily away without restoring tranquillity to the widowed breast of Willoughby. But he had sworn never to complain, and not a murmur escaped his lips. He, however, avoided all society; and a settled gloom, not entirely untinctured with superstition, pervaded his mind. He felt a void which nothing on earth could supply. His only solace was in the caresses of his children; and his only remaining wish, to see them educated and happy, and then to join his Amelia in those blissful regions where the anguish of parting could be felt no more. His infant son engrossed his most particular attention; but the singular circumstances of his birth being ever present in his imagination, kept alive and cherished those reflections which were most detrimental to his peace. He could not help considering him as connected with some extraordinary destiny, in the contemplation of which, he often detected himself absorbed in the reverie of romance; so entirely wrapt in a vision of the future, as to forget the occurrences which were passing around him. The luxuriant wilds of Miami occasionally obtruded on his fancy, and the phenomenon of a speaking corpse was not wanting to finish the picture. The recurrence of one sentiment, however, would, at times, absorb every other in his bosom; and that one was his eternal gratitude to Washington. In reflecting that this god-like man had been the patron of his youth, and the arbiter of his fortune, he could almost forget his domestic affliction. The token of his friendship, his inestimable sword, was religiously preserved, as the richest legacy he could bequeath a son, evidently destined by Heaven to wield it with success in the sacred cause of freedom. He had already bestowed on him the name of that illustrious hero, and fondly hoped that the gift might be accompanied by a portion of his spirit. As he pressed the infant in his arms, he would breathe a mental prayer that he might be modelled from the pattern of human perfection whose name he bore. “Make him but the successful champion of his country's rights, and it is all the earthly blessing I ask for my son.” This unqualified veneration for a human being, was a pardonable weakness in Willoughby, if we take into consideration the peculiar circumstances that created it, with which the reader is already acquainted. But a new affliction awaited him, which for a time diverted the current of his reflections into a different channel. The small-pox broke out in the neighbourhood, and before the anxious parent could give that terrible disorder its most favorable chance, by innoculation, his two eldest daughters again enjoyed the caresses of their angel mother. Amelia and George recovered. Willoughby did not become a misanthrope; but he now determined to adopt a plan which he had occasionally contemplated, viz. that of bidding an eternal adieu to the busy haunts of civilization, and immuring himself, for the remainder of his life, in the western wilderness. Not as a hermit; but as a Grecian philosopher, with an unfrequented grove for his academy, and his darling children his only pupils. He had always dreaded the contagion of vicious example to the young and inexperienced mind; and at this time all the vices of the old world were daily imported into the new, accompanied with their pernicious and enervating luxuries. He readily foresaw, that if this growing evil continued, the rising generation would prove but weak and puny representatives of their heroic fathers, the champions of American freedom. He lamented that it was not in his power to prevent so great a national calamity, but wished at any rate to save his own son, by snatching him in season from the sphere of contagion, and placing him beyond the reach of its influence. The loss of two lovely daughters fixed this wavering resolution. He had not forgotten 3 the romantic scenes on the southern border of lake Erie; and in that delightful region, though then arrayed in the wildest garb of nature, he determined to fix his future residence. Accordingly, having procured from government the requisite patent, sold his paternal estate, and placed his children under the temporary protection of their maternal uncle, he took possession of his wild retreat in the following spring. A few hardy laborers, procured for the purpose, under his tasteful and judicious direction, soon converted a portion of this wilderness into a beautiful garden, and literally “caused the desart to blossom as the rose.” In less than two years a neat rural mansion was erected on the charming spot, finished in a style of cottage elegance, and bountifully supplied with every domestic comfort—save the greatest. It stood on a gentle declivity, not half a mile from the shore of the lake, and about the same distance from the river Cayahoga. This beautiful spot abounded with fruit of the most delicious kind, and in the most luxuriant quantity. It was in the centre of a grove of black and white mulberry trees, interspersed with chesnuts, cherries, plumbs, and the custard apple. At a little distance was a forest of sycamore, whose lofty branches were entwined with grape-vines, and beneath whose shade reposed the wild deer and game of various descriptions. Turkeys, geese, ducks, and swans, were visible in every direction; and the woods were vocal with their feathered tenants. This paradisical retreat the major denominated Mulberry-grove, by which appellation it still continues to be distinguished, though most of the trees have disappeared. A maiden sister, about two years younger than himself, his two children, a female domestic, and two or three laborers, composed the whole of Willoughby's household. This sister had been disappointed, in a most tender attachment, by the death of her lover, who fell on Bunker-hill, gallantly fighting for his country's freedom. The idea of a second engagement was sacrilege to her first and only love, and she therefore determined to remain a vestal for life. She wished to retire from society, and could think of no situation so congenial to her present taste, as the rural retreat of her disabled brother, whom she loved with true sisterly affection, and whose voluntary solitude she wished to solace by her tender assiduities. In the education of his children, his rural occupations, and the society of his sister, the grief of Willoughby gradually wore away. But it had imparted a perpetual cast of melancholy, a sombre tint to his character and deportment, that rendered both peculiarly interesting. His principal recreations were hunting and fishing; the former, however, could be but partially enjoyed, from the loss of his hand. Books, of which he had a valuable selection, occupied the evening, and the writing a journal of his military career, was his morning amusement. Though not liberally educated, he was an accomplished English scholar; and, since his misfortune, had acquired the art of writing an elegant character with his left hand. It is to this journal I am indebted for the facts here recorded. He had valuable correspondents, in various parts of the United States, with whom he continued an epistolary communication, among whom were several members of the general government, and gentlemen of distinction in the army and navy. Thus was “solitude sweetened” by friendship, though uninterrupted by the presence of friends. Gardening was a science for which he had a great predilection, and no inconsiderable taste; at any rate, there are few at this day which exhibit a more happy combination of utile cum dulce, than that which flourished under the direction of Major Willoughby. In this manner lived our modern recluse, if not happy, at least contented; cultivating, by turns, the fertile soil without, and the susceptible minds within. Two of the most perfect of all human beings, in his estimation, were selected for his models, and his greatest desire was to form his children like them: To make his daughter a second Amelia—his son another Washington. He still continued to enjoy the friendship and confidence of that patriot and hero, until death terminated his earthly career of glory and usefulness; when, at the age of sixty-eight, he passed into that permanent state of existence where virtue is sure to meet its eternal reward.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. SON OF A BACK-WOODS-MAN. In truth he was a strange and wayward wight, Fond of each gentle and each dreadful scene, In darkness and in storm he found delight; Nor less than when on ocean-wave serene The southern sun diffused his dazzling sheen. Beattie's Minstrel. George Washington Willoughby was the child of Nature, and his greatest delight the contemplation of her sublime and romantic features. This taste was derived from the very source which gratified it, the rude and majestic scenery which surrounded the isolated residence of his childhood. Every thing was wild about him, except the domestic animals in his father's inclosures. The scream of the eagle and the roaring of cataracts were sounds familiar to his infantile ear. The whipperwill's melancholy notes lulled him to repose, and the warbling of the mock-bird awoke him in the morning. The wild goats were seen browsing on the sides of the mountain, and the timid deer brushing through thickets of chesnut and sycamore. On one hand rose an almost impenetrable forest, on the other rolled the waves of an inland ocean. Here flowed a tranquil river, and there dashed an impetuous water-fall. The son of Major Willoughby was a stranger to the weak indulgences and pernicious luxuries which enervate the systems and ruin the constitutions of half the infantile race. Fed on plain but wholesome viands, he murmured not for dainties of whose existence he was ignorant. Health bloomed in his cheeks—pleasure sparkled 3 in his eyes—strength and elasticity were displayed in his limbs. Every step was a bound— every movement, agility. He was an infant Hercules. In disposition he was a compound of contrarieties. With all his father's enthusiasm and daring enterprise, he had no small portion of his mother's gentleness, combined with an obstinacy which belonged to neither. Any opposition that encountered this spirit, served only to increase its inflexibility. His ardor always rose in proportion to the strength of the obstacle which opposed it. One thing alone could divert him from the pursuit, and that was a conviction of its impropriety; and he possessed so much intuitive veneration for the opinions and authority of his father, that he generally yielded an immediate assent and obedience. The natural objects which surrounded him, almost unrivalled for their wild magnificence, were native to him, for he had no recollection of having ever seen any other. Rocky mountains, craggy steeps, and frightful precipices, were subjects of his earliest contemplation, and had at length become as familiar to his footsteps as the umbrageous vistas of his father's garden. He would climb the most rugged promontory that overlooked the lake, leap from rock to rock, and fearlessly rest on the brink of unfathomable chasms. With a curiosity ardent as his perseverance, he delighted in exploring untrodden recesses, and penetrating every excavation he discovered. In ascending the tallest tree, he rivalled its native squirrel, and the finny inhabitants of Erie were scarcely more familiar to its waves. He caught birds for his sister, and killed rattle-snakes for his diversion. He would angle for fish, shoot teal with his bow, and swim like a spaniel for his game. His amusements were diversified by the seasons. When the earth was covered with the snows of winter, he coursed down the hills in his sled, or swept the glossy surface of the lake on his skates. In all these health-giving exercises his father most freely indulged him. They promoted mental activity, and increased corporeal vigor. While they imperceptibly begat in his mind the conceptions of lofty enterprise, they secured to his person the requisite powers for execution. It is possible, however, that the solitude of his situation, connected with the wild ferocity of nature around him, might have too strongly marked the lineaments of his character, had it not already imbibed a trait that corrected the bias. This was his taste for literature, and eagerness for intellectual acquirements. Ever submissive to parental counsel, there arose no difficulty in arranging a plan for the enjoyment of both his favorite pursuits, by making each alternately a relaxation from the other. When his lesson begat lassitude, athletic diversions relieved. When exercise wearied, study afforded repose. His constitution was too mercurial for indolence, either of mind or body: one or both were perpetually in motion. The education and recreations of the lovely Amelia, (who was two years older than George) were not dissimilar to those of her brother. She did not indeed accompany him in all his daring excursions, but she would run, wrestle, pitch quoits, shoot the bow, and skate with him. Their scholastic exercises were the same, with the exception of a few feminine accomplishments taught by their aunt. They loved each other tenderly, and were never so happy as in interchanging some little offices of kindness. George would climb trees to plunder birds-nests for Amelia; and Amelia gathered flowers to make nosegays for George. He selected the richest clusters of wild grapes to regale her, or shook the black mulberries from their branches, while she held her apron to receive them. Ignorant of the world, and innocent as the lambs they caressed, they scarcely knew that such a thing as misery existed. The melancholy cast of their father's habits was imperceptible to them, because they saw nothing but his kindness. He never, in their presence, conversed on past afflictions, but merely imparted enough to give them a vague idea that they had a mother in heaven, whom they should one day see, if they continued to be good children. Though a firm believer in revealed religion himself, he did not think it his duty to perplex the unformed minds of his children with creeds and catechisms which they could not comprehend. The plain precepts of practical piety, he was most careful to inculeate, with the great fundamental truths of theology; but always insisted that the human mind should be in some measure matured before theology itself was studied as a science. Though Willoughby acted as tutor to his children, he was careful to assume none of that chilling austerity which too often damps the ardor of infantile genius, or cramps it in the iron fetters of terror. He studied with them, and treated them more as companions than pupils—he was their friend and adviser. But his commands, though always mildly uttered, were as immutable as the laws of Persia. The mandate once passed his lips, the most implicit obedience was expected, and (after a few practical illustrations of the penalty) never expected in vain. A natural aptitude to learn, soon made their tasks a pleasure which they would not have willingly relinquished. Amelia was conscious of being in advance of her brother, yet, to encourage his application, she generously affected to be in the rear; and while she pretended to ask him for information, was imperceptibly furnishing him with new ideas. Thus he profited by her instruction, while his feelings were spared the pain of discovering it. One source of enjoyment, to George in particular, was the recital of their father's adventures, to which they would listen with the most greedy attention, while the various sensations they produced in their tender minds, were visibly reflected from their expressive little countenances. When the soft twilight of evening had suspended the various duties of the day, the season of social converse commenced. On an ample platform, before the door, the whole family would assemble, and while the major was enjoying his pipe, the children would entreat him to renew the interesting subject. Perhaps the moon would be just entering upon a pure field of unclouded azure, spangled with myriads of glittering constellations. The tenants of a neighbouring fen would be murmuring their loves, while some solitary owl uttered her complaints to the woods. No scene could be better adapted to the subject. The whole party could distinctly hear the rushing of that very stream which received the corses of many who fell in the battle he was describing. The nightly howl of the wolf and catamount, at times, saluted their ears; and the narrator had reposed where a watch-fire alone kept those monsters aloof. The shuddering Amelia, with an exclamation of terror, clung closer to her affectionate aunt. The flashing eyes of her brother betrayed the tire that was kindling in his bosom. It burst forth: “My dear father, when I am grown a man, shall I not fight for freedom too?” His hand was extended—his cheeks glowed— his attitude was supplicating. His father gazed on him a moment with delight, then snatched him in his arms, and pressed him to his heart. “Yes, my dear boy! for that was you granted to my prayer—for that did I devote you to my country before I knew of your birth. If its freedom be again in danger—if her rights should be once more trampled on by tyrants—go, in God's name; and may you wield the sword of Washington with as much ardor and success as your father has done.” George almost shouted with joy, and strutted along the platform with the deportment of a hero. But Amelia wept with terror, flew from her aunt to her brother, and clinging round his neck, begged him to relinquish the dreadful design. “If you should go to these wicked wars, (she sobbed out) what will become of me! You will be killed, or lose your-limbs, and poor Amelia will break her heart.” “Be not alarmed, my love;” interrupted her delighted father; “I hope we are to enjoy many years of peace and happiness before another hostile weapon is drawn. Banish your fears— your brother shall not be taken from you.” With this assurance she returned to the side of her aunt, and tranquillity was again restored to her bosom.</field>

The infant hero takes the daring leap, And boldly plunges in the frightful deep; There pants and struggles with the whirling wave, Risking his own a fellow's life to save. Anon. The only human visitants, that had ever interrupted the profound solitude of the Willoughby family, were warriors and hunters belonging to a neighbouring tribe of friendly Indians. These untutored children of nature found a constant welcome at this seat of hospitality, from which they never departed without receiving refreshment, and some trifling token of its owner's bounty. Gratitude is not exclusively the virtue of christians, although a christian virtue. Many of these savages possessed it in an eminent degree. The hospitality of “One Hand” became proverbial among them, and the best of their game was generally selected as a present for their host. It was some time before George could become reconciled to the presence of these red intruders. He never saw an Indian but he thought of his father's mutilated limb, and felt his little spirit rising in open rebellion against the doctrine of charity inculcated by his father. How very evident it is, that “love thy enemies” must be a divine precept, when it is so opposite and so repugnant to our depraved natures. To his sister alone he would give vent to his feelings on this occasion, and console himself with the hope of soon becoming a man, and possessing that wonderful sword whose almost magic virtues he had so often heard his father extol. “Don't think of it, George! These are not the bad men who deprived papa of his hand. You must not be angry with every body for the fault of one. If you and I were to quarrel, would you never be friends with me again? Say, George, suppose we were to be so wicked as to fight, and I was even to bite off your little finger, would you never forgive me?” “Yes,” exclaimed her brother, “I would forgive you any thing, even if you broke my arm. But to cut off the hand, and the right hand too, of so good and so useful a man as my father—I don't feel that I can forgive that, Amelia. And if these are not the same men, I am sure they are exactly like them, and would be as cruel. The picture of the strange chief over the fire-place, is an exact likeness of Tecumseh.” “Come, come, George, the great book our father reads to us, instructs us to judge no one rashly, but to love all, even our enemies. But these poor Indians, who have never been taught to read, are not our enemies now, even if they once were. Besides, the misfortune we lament occurred in open war; and I have heard you say that in a fair fight”—She knew what key to touch. “Yes, I know, Amelia; I won't be angry with them any more. I am sure it is wrong, else my father and you would not tell me so. But if they make war again, when I am big, and have Washington's sword—” Amelia arrested the threat by placing her hand on his lips. “I don't love to hear you talk on that subject, George; whenever a word is mentioned about Indians, about war, and about that terrible sword, your cheeks grow so red, and your eyes look so fierce, and you seem so cross, that I hardly know you. Come, my brother, be goodnatured, and let us finish our lesson.” In this manner would affection and reason ever smooth whatever was rough, and soften all that was hard in the temper of George. By slow degrees this very natural antipathy wore off, till a cool acquaintance grew into friendship and intimacy, when an incident occurred, not very trivial in its nature, nor entirely unimportant in its consequences. It was a mild day in March. The ice of the lake was not entirely broken up, nor the snow dissolved from the hills. Several of George's red acquaintances, (among whom was Logan, a chief of distinction, with his only son) had stopped at the Grove, on their return from a hunting excursion. On the margin of the lake was a huge rock, at the foot of which they had kindled a fire, and were seated around it on stones, regaling themselves with venison and rabbit, broiled on the coals, and bread and cider brought by Amelia from the house. The son of Logan was playing with George on the ice. This young Indian was about twelve years old, hale and active, with regular features and graceful form. He had already distinguished 4 himself in the chase, and exhibited tokens of future greatness in the hostile field: he was the pride of his father, and a great favorite among the young warriors of his tribe. His long black hair, which shone like the glossy plumage of the raven, hung loose upon his shoulders. A cap of variegated feathers adorned his head; his red hunting-frock was fastened by a belt of wampum, curiously embroidered with porcupine quills; bracelets of party-colored shells ornamented his wrists and ancles, and his mockasons were trimmed with the teeth of a catamount he had slain. As he flew after George on the ice, he resembled the feathered Mercury of the Greeks. At some distance from the shore the ice was thin and frequently open, of which the boys had been carefully cautioned. But, in the ardor of pursuit, they ventured too far, and one of these treacherous openings lay in the direct line of a race unrivalled by the wind for swiftness. George, who was on his skates, providentially saw the threatening danger, avoided it by a timely curve, and endeavored to warn his friend. But the speed of the young savage could neither be arrested nor his course diverted; he flew past George like lightning, and disappeared beneath the ice. Amelia was at that moment accepting from one of her grateful guests, an ornament for her neck, ingeniously woven from the scarlet feathers of the flamingo. It dropped from her hand, while with a shrick of terror she pointed to the fatal spot. The Indians sent forth a yell of horror, and darted upon the ice. George knew that there was not an instant to be lost by seeking assistance from the shore— his play-fellow must perish, or be saved on the moment. He had once risen to the surface, but beyond his reach; in a moment he re-appeared at a still greater distance. It was the crisis of his fate; with a desperate plunge George caught him by the hair, by which he sustained him with one hand, while he seized hold of the ice with the other. The ice gave way, and both were descending for ever, as Logan caught George by the wrist, and saved them both from a watery grave. By this time the whole family had been alarmed, and were hastening to the spot, when they met the dripping youths returning in safety with the Indians. No words can describe the different sensations which agitated each one of the now happy group. In the genuine language of nature Logan poured out his thanks to the heroic boy who had risked his own life to save a poor Indian's; while George expressed his gratitude to Logan for preserving them both. Congratulations were mutually interchanged by all. Amelia, however, was insensible to every thing but her brother; she had seen him plunge into the water, and could scarcely realize his safety. With a kind of frantic rapture she now clasped him in her arms, and sobbed aloud on his bosom. “Noble boy!” exclaimed his enraptured father. “You have realized my hopes. Doubly precious to me is that life which has thus been voluntarily jeopardized to save a fellow being; yet, dear as it is and ever will be to my heart, I had rather see it sacrificed to duty, than meanly preserved by shrinking from its performance.” George had acted, perhaps, more from an impulse of instinct, than from any definite idea of duty: he knew not precisely how much he had risked, but he was sure that he had gained more than an equivalent. The commendations he received from all, were very grateful to his feelings; but this undisguised approbation of his father, so warmly expressed, filled his young bosom with a tumult of delight. In the fulness of his joy he embraced the grateful object of his perilous achievement, and called him his brother; and then whispered his sister—“Yes, Amelia, this is better than fighting.” This little adventure created a chain of friendship too strong to be broken. Never were red and white so harmoniously mingled, and the union was too perfect for time to weaken. The story was circulated with avidity, and celebrated in the rude songs of the natives. Logan had always been a faithful friend to the whites, and a warm advocate with his countrymen in the cause of American freedom. The strong tie of gratitude was now interwoven with this zealous attachment. Alone and single-handed, he now would have contended with a host in defence of his friends. The son was not backward in evincing his sense of the obligation he was under to his generous preserver. His visits became more frequent and regular, and any service in his power was at George's command. He taught him to shoot the bow with an accuracy that he had conceived impossible, and to draw an arrow from his quiver with the grace of Diana; to make canoes of the bark of trees, and ornament them with a thousand ingenious devices; to throw the hatchet with remarkable precision, and sound the war-whoop with considerable effect. In short, the society of the young Indian soon became so essential to the happiness of George, that his impatience would chide the lingering weeks of his red brother's absence. His studies were not neglected; but so well did he profit from young Logan's lessons, that, at the age of ten, George Washington Willoughby had become quite an accomplished savage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE BLIND HARPER. At last a soft and solemn breathing sound, Rose like a stream of rich distilled perfumes, And stole upon the air, that even Silence Was took ere she was aware, and wish'd she might Deny her nature, and be never more Still, to be so displaced. Milton. The current of emigration from the east to the west, had run so rapidly during the foregoing period, that our recluses began to find themselves surrounded by civilized neighbors. Though this circumstance would have been unpleasant to Willoughby at an early period of his exile, he now regarded it with no inconsiderable satisfaction. He was formed for society, nor had his long exclusion unfitted him for its enjoyments. Well aware that these hardy enterprizing settlers were not of that class he had been so eager to shun, he felt no repugnance at their approach. Without some social intercourse, the manners of his children could not acquire a certain degree of refinement indispensably necessary on their entering the world. 4* He intended that his son, at a proper period, should finish his studies at the university; but without some graduating medium, the too sudden transition from nature to art would be very unpleasant to his feelings, if not deleterious to his hopes; for among the latent qualities of the boy's mind, which were daily unfolding and presenting themselves to the parent's view, there was readily discovered a large share of that exquisite sensibility which shrinks from the approach of derision or contempt, as the sensitive plant from the touch. In the year one thousand eight hundred and nine, George was fifteen years of age, with a stature and strength that would have passed for seventeen. In the mean time, several little villages had grown up around them, the nearest of which was at the distance of five miles; a few scattering habitations were somewhat nearer. The sound of the exterminating axe was now heard from a thousand directions, and the forests melted before it. Fire followed the axe, and luxuriant vegetation succeeded the fire. Roads were levelled, waggons constructed, and intercourse increased. With the Willoughby family the ice was soon broken. Acquaintances were formed, visits made, and visitors received. The major had recovered enough of cheerfulness to make every one pleased with him and each other; and his sister, now just on the right side of fifty, exhibited the rare phenomenon of an agreeable old maid. George was pleased, and Amelia delighted; for they at length saw a specimen of that world of which they had heard a little, read much, and thought more. Every thing, by degrees, assumed a different aspect; and a taste for external accomplishments was soon observable in these two children of the desert. Their aunt encouraged and directed the renovation, while the father smiled his approbation of its progress. Thus the few seeds of refinement accidentally dropt in the wilderness, took such successful root, that in a few months these “aukward rustics” were looked up to by the villagers as the models of taste and good breeding. It was summer; and, invited by the peculiar beauty of the scene, our young hero and his sister had imperceptibly extended a morning ramble beyond their accustomed circuit. The dew yet glittered on the honey-suckle, where the bee had just commenced his delicious vocation. The air was lulled into a solemn stillness; not a leaf was in motion, save that of the aspin; or when the wild deer rustled through the clustering dogwood and scattered its blossoms in their path. The ground was carpeted with the richest verdure, through which the wild strawberry lifted its purple head. Fatigued with walking, they sat down on a bank of moss, around which crept the fragrant sweet-briar and the fadeless laurel, to survey the various beauties around them. The broad lake was in view, like a polished mirror, in which the swan was surveying her snowy plumage and graceful neck as she sailed along its reflective surface. At a distance were several vessels becalmed, and here and there appeared a sportsman in his skiff, dimpling the lake with his oar. It was that kind of stillness which can seem to be heard, that now surrounded them, interrupted only by the solitary tap of the wood-pecker, when a soft strain of music broke gently on the ear. They listened with surprize and delight, to an air of peculiar sweetness, but as new to their ear, as were the tones which composed it; now swelling with impressive energy and then dying away in the softest murmurs. It seemed the effect of enchantment, and they rose to discover the unseen minstrel. After proceeding some distance, they suddenly emerged from the woods, and found themselves at the door of a small log house, built in the Indian style, of square timber, the joints and crevices plastered with clay; a little further were several workmen laying the foundation of a more commodious mansion. The music which had drawn them to the spot had ceased, but they believed this cabin contained the performer; nor were they mistaken, for while they hesitated about entering, the strain was renewed, accompanied by a female voice. They paused on the threshold, and listened in breathless delight to the following song: Hibernia's tears forever flow, Her barp in silence slumbers; Her bards the patriot song forego, Nor dare to breathe its numbers. No more they bid the swelling tone In Freedom's cause awaken; Those happy days of bliss are flown, And Erin weeps forsaken. But though her sons in exile roam, They sleep on Freedom's pillow; And Erin's daughters find a home, Beyond the western billow. There shall they breathe the glowing strain, To joy's extatic numbers; There Erin's harp shall wake again, In rapture from its slumbers. All was again silent in the cottage; but the curiosity of the delighted auditors was far from sinking to repose with the closing strain. In their eagerness to obtain a sight of the performer and his unknown instrument, ceremony was forgotten: they lifted the latch and entered unobserved. Every thing within wore an air of comfort and neatness; but this was not yet observed by the curious intruders, for their attention was riveted to a more interesting subject. On a bench directly opposite the door, sat the most venerable figure they had ever beheld, in front of whom stood an elegant formed girl, holding a cup of milk to his lips, with a hand of the most delicate whiteness; and beside him stood the instrument from which he had drawn such enchanting melody. The “harp of Erin” was instantly recognized, of which George and Amelia had often read, but which they had never seen nor heard until this fortunate morning. The position of the female prevented her seeing the visitors; and the old harper, as they immediately suspected, was bereft of sight. It has been intimated that our young foresters possessed sensibility and enthusiasm. Both had been excited by the adventure, and were now heightened by the scene before them. “Enough, my child,” said the old man, as she took the cup from his lips, and wiped his silvered temples with her white handkerchief; “thank you, my love—thank you.” George never took pains to suppress his feelings, unless they were accompanied by a consciousness of criminality, and then he generally conquered them. But he felt no such conscious ness on the present occasion, but exclaimed with considerable vehemence—“An angel! Amelia, an angel!” The old harper uttered an exclamation of surprise, while the cup fell from the hand of the startled damsel. An apology, however, was instantly made, with so much grace and good-breeding, that the whole group were perfectly satisfied and pleased with each other, and after half an hour's conversation, felt less like strangers than they did like old acquaintances. In the course of this interview, our adventurers learned the following particulars: that the name of their beautiful little hostess was Catharine Fleming; that Ireland was her native country; that the old blind harper (Dennis O'Hara) was her grand-father, and that her parents were just gone over to the neighboring village, from whence she every moment expected their return. While Catharine and Amelia were engaged in conversation, George had approached the harp, and begged permission to examine its form and construction. He touched the wires, and they complained in discord. Both then united in a request to hear its aged master perform, who politely complied, and charmed his guests with several popular airs of his native country. He commenced with the ancient Gradh gan fios,[1] [1] Love in secret. which is perhaps one of the most pleasing compositions that any country has produced, and his auditors were in extacies during its performance. He next played Ad ccoigreac ma bin tu,† † If to a foreign clime you go. which he informed them was the oldest air now extant. “It is so ancient,” added he, “that the name of its author is unknown, and no trace can be discovered of the century in which it was produced. At the Belfast meeting of harpers, on the twelfth day of July, in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, it was sung by only one person, who was of great age, and although numbers were present, few knew it even by name; but we were all greatly delighted with the composition, and I learned it on hearing it repeated.” He then performed Carolan's Fairy Queen, and the ancient air Ta an samradh teacht,[2] [2] Summer is coming. and ended with the celebrated Scarfuint na Gompanach.† † Pasting of Friends. In these performances his very soul seemed engaged, bursting its tangible fetters, and floating in melody to another world. His feelings, at length, became too ardent, tears fell on his hand, and his grand-daughter prevailed on him to stop, and attend to some cheerful topic of discourse. But the instantaneous change of a key, is as difficult in feeling as in music. “Be not surprized, young man, that these poor blind eyes should weep—they have seen too much. Yes,” he continued with increased emotion, “they have seen one of my sons expire on a scaffold for his contempt of tyranny, and another dragged like a slave on board the tyrant's floating dungeons. No wonder their sight was blasted.” The curiosity of George was excited, but he saw the propriety of restraining it for the present, and joined with his sister in diverting the old man from the subject. “My poor uncle Patrick,” said Catharine, in answer to Amelia's enquiring glance; “he was—” but the theme was too painful, and she paused. “Uncle William is in the navy,” she resumed, wiping a tear from her eye—“on board the Majestic, please God he be living.” The old harper groaned heavily. In a few minutes they were joined by the parents of this charming girl, just returned from the next village, whither they had been to make some necessary purchases. A mutual introduction took place, and the conversation became general, pleasing and animated; till, alarmed at the height of the sun, Amelia proposed to return, and these new friends separated with mutual promises of improving their intimacy. On their way home, George suddenly awoke from a deep fit of musing, and exclaimed, “I must learn to play the harp, Amelia, and O'Hara shall be my teacher.” At breakfast, the relation of their adventure was closed with the same suggestion. His father was always ready to indulge every innocent wish; a harp was purchased by his agent at New-York, and George soon became a player of no inconsiderable merit. In the mean time, his sister, under her aunt's tuition, could touch the guitar with judgment and taste. Her voice was melody itself, and George turned poet to furnish her with songs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. A DIALOGUE ON POLITICS. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not. Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's. Shakspeare. Major Willoughby soon became intimate with his Irish neighbors, and deemed their society a valuable acquisition. Fleming had been, for several years, the proprietor of an extensive linen factory, in his native country; but being nearly ruined by the treachery of an agent, he had collected the scattered fragments of his fortune, and migrated to America. Ohio lands were cheap, and he had purchased a farm adjoining that of Willoughby, both extending to the shores of the lake. Fleming was now about forty years old, and had seen the world without becoming contaminated with its vices. His reading had been extensive, and his observation discerning. He could converse with equal facility on literature, agriculture, or the arts. The politics of Europe were “familiar as his garter,” and in ethics or philosophy he was never at a loss. Mrs. Fleming possessed a very amiable disposition, social in her manners, and delicate in her sentiments; but destitute of that repulsive stiffness which is often assumed and mistaken for modesty. Her education was not finished, but natural good sense supplied the deficiency. Blest with a strong retentive memory, and an excellent taste, she could immediately copy and adopt for 5 her own, what it cost others much pains and study to acquire. Their daughter, Catharine, had counted thirteen springs, and in that little period had made a progress in the useful branches of education, uncommon for her sex in this age of false refinement. She was blest with parents, who both united in the unfashionable opinion that a correct knowledge of reading, writing, grammar, and history, added to a thorough acquaintance with her needle, were more valuable acquirements than those which are merely ornamental, and therefore ought to be studied first. They contended that the former would remain a never-failing source of profit and delight, long after the season for enjoying the latter was for ever gone. Happily for Catharine, she had imbibed the same notion, and was as ambitious of excelling in the useful sciences as her school-mates were in the polite accomplishments. Having thus early secured the most valuable and lasting, she was ready to commence the lighter exercises of ornament and refinement, when the revolution in her father's circumstances at once interrupted the arrangement, and demonstrated the utility of that system on which it had been made. But Catharine Fleming needed no external ornament to render her pleasing. A soul of innocence and beneficence emanated through her beautiful countenance, and charmed every one with its sweetness. Whether in the city or country, the ball-room or dairy, she would still be lovely, for her beauties were all her own, all internal, yet all visible. But what more particularly endeared her to the Willoughby family was her affectionate attention to her poor old grand-father. O'Hara was blind and possessed no earthly solace for his affliction but his harp and his darling grand-daughter. The former had been the friend and companion of his youth; the latter was the eyes and comfort of his age. While bending over his harp, and drinking in the melody of its silver tones, the images of past enjoyments would sometimes rush on his mind, and drown his sightless eye-balls with tears. These were wiped away by the tender hand of his favorite, and his mind diverted to forget their source. She would call to mind his favorite song, and warble it in concert with his harp. A few months after the event recorded in the foregoing chapter, Fleming dined at the Grove, in company with a gentleman, who was then on a tour of public business through the western country. This was Judge Brown, from the state of New-York, one of Fleming's earliest acquaintances on his arrival in the United States; a member of the Society of Friends, a magistrate of no inconsiderable celebrity, and well known as a man of learning and exemplary piety. The early education of Brown had been such as the youth of that sect commonly receive; accurate and useful so far as it went, without aspiring to elegant literature, or mere speculative science.[3] [3] See Analectic Magazine, vol. v. p. 292. But his mind was too active and inquisitive to rest content with these humble rudiments, and by seizing upon every opportunity of improvement, he had gradually acquired a large fund of various and well-digested knowledge. He had for several years resided in the city of New-York, as teacher of the public school of the society of Friends, but had afterwards been induced, by the offer of an advantageous purchase of a large tract of land, near the shore of Lake Ontario, to remove thither and establish a settlement, which had rapidly improved, while Brown rose with it, in wealth, importance, and public estimation. He was now judge of the county court, and a leading man in all the public business of that part of the country. After the cloth was removed, an interesting conversation commenced on the subject of botany and chemistry, with which the Judge was intimately acquainted. The progress of American manufactures was the next topic, on which Fleming appeared perfectly at home. The subject of manufactures insensibly led to that of commerce; and from commerce, at that day, it was remarkably easy to slide into politics. The negotiations then pending between the United States and Great Britain were spoken of, when the major expressed a confident hope that an amicable arrangement would take place with the two governments, peace be preserved, and commercial rights respected; and ended with something like an encomium on England, which gave more surprize than pleasure to the mind of Fleming. “Is it possible, Major Willoughby,” he exclaimed, “that such can be your sentiments of a nation, whose injustice and violation of faith have become proverbial all over the world; whose ambition claims the sole and supreme government of the ocean, the great highway of nations, and who extends her conquests for the purpose of enslaving the vanquished?” “I am no apologist,” returned Willoughby, “for the ambition of England, and least of all for the injustice of her corrupted ministry. It is of the nation at large that I speak, people like ourselves, who would as readily and cheerfully render justice to us, as to each other. I allude to the people of England, and not to the public servants of that people, who have too often deceived and betrayed them. In my opinion, gentlemen, these two nations, America and England, are distined by heaven to become the two greatest on earth, and will one day be united in the strictest bonds of amity and peace.” “Was such thy opinion during the revolutionary war?” enquired the quaker. “Yes, sir—we warred against a government that would have enslaved us; and to preserve our freedom, were obliged to raise our hands against our brethren; not that we loved them less, but that we loved our posterity more. We fought for rational liberty, were successful, and all antipathies should cease. “Enemies in war —in peace, friends.” “But how, sir,” exclaimed Fleming, “is it possible for antipathies to cease, when aggressions are still continued? You say America was successful. But let me ask, what security has she acquired from foreign insults and injustice? Although England may not attempt to raise a revenue in our states and territories, does she not still do it from our commerce, and are not some thousands of native Americans enslaved in her navy?” “When I express a hope of an amicable adjustment of differences,” observed Willoughby, “I wish to be understood as meaning also an honorable reparation for injuries, indemnity for the past and security for the future. Much as I 5* desire peace, I would insist on strict justice. For though it is the duty of an individual to forgive, bear, and forbear, the precept will not apply in a national point of view.” “I have always understood,” interrupted the Judge, “that whatever could be predicated of an individual, was equally predicable of a body or a nation. I would thank thee, friend, to discriminate.” “I conceive differently,” replied the major; “as an individual I forgive, bear, and forbear, because I am willing to undergo, for my single self, all the temporal evils resulting from such a conduct, in order to conquer my natural propensity to the contrary, and discharge my duty as a christian. All this I should do and suffer for the sake of promoting my eternal welfare. But as the representative of a nation, I have no right to control the freedom of their will by entailing on them the temporal evils of humility, without I could, by so doing, promote their future and eternal welfare; for any acts of forbearance on the part of government, however laudable in themselves, will never be imputed by the Almighty to a people who do not sanction them. So that what is a present loss and eternal gain to an individual, would be a permanent loss and no future gain to the nation at large.” “But dost thou not believe,” asked Brown, “that the Almighty would bless that nation whose government acted on such principles, and preserve them not only from temporal evils, but future ruin?” “No, sir,” answered the major, “I cannot believe that the Almighty will ever bestow any peculiar blessing on a wicked man for the sake of a good one. His blessings flow alike to all, if all would prepare themselves alike to receive them.” “But it seems to me, gentlemen, that you are wandering from the subject,” said Fleming; “you say, major, that government ought to exact strict justice from England, as the basis of an honorable treaty?” “I am of that opinion, sir, and hope, at the same time, that they will not overlook an account of the same nature which remains unsettled with the French emperor.” “There, sir,” cried Fleming, “I must beg leave to differ with you—the account with France is not of the same nature. The French government never impressed your seamen, murdered a Pearce, attacked a Chesapeake, nor violated the edicts of your government. Still, sir, I am no apologist for Bonaparte; I consider him on the continent what his rival is on the ocean, an insatiable tyrant, thirsting for universal dominion; and to all tyranny, of every description, I am a sworn and eternal enemy.” “All the aggressions you have mentioned,” answered the major. “must be atoned for; or else, not withstanding the horrors attending on war, (the greatest but one of human calamities) the respect we owe ourselves, and the justice we owe our posterity, will compel us to the dreadful alternative. But I hope better things.” “Pray, sir,” enquired Fleming, “to what political party do you belong?” Willoughby smiled. “To none, sir: I am an American, the only name I profess—a champion of freedom, the only title I covet. Whoever endangers that is an enemy, not to me, but to my country.” “Not your enemy, major?” asked Fleming in a tone of surprize. “No, sir, I never had an enemy. I lost a hand, not in fighting for myself, but in defending my country. Though my sword has tasted blood, my feelings and passions had no agency in the act. I felt that I was engaged in a duty similar to that in which we are engaged in fighting and subduing our internal spiritual enemies, our evil propensities, which we are commanded to overcome and destroy, though dearer to us than life. For as we do the one for the welfare and happiness of the country which protects us, so we perform the other for the promotion and extension of our Redeemer's kingdom; and our share of felicity in each is always proportionate to the uses we perform for both.” “A very strange discrimination, and most singular comparison,” was Fleming's remark. “Pray friend,” enquired Brown, “to what religious sect dost thou belong?” Willoughby again smiled. “To none, Sir. In religion as in politics, I know but one party. I am a christian, and know of no name under heaven by which man can be saved, but that of Jesus Christ, our Creator and Redeemer.” “But this is again flying from the subject,” said Fleming. “You say, sir, that you are an American, so are we all (by birth or adoption); but which of the two administrations do you prefer, the federal or republican?” “Mr. Fleming, you must consider the question of considerable importance by the earnestness with which you urge it—but I consider it of no importance whatever. The last fifteen years of my life has been passed in a wilderness; I have taken no part in the various questions of policy which have arisen in that period. From the loop-holes of retreat I have, indeed, occasionally peeped at mankind, and like the poet, whose expression I use, have sighed for their follies and crimes. I have seen two great political parties, by turns, possess the ascendency and hold the reins of government. I entirely approve of neither. I have found much to commend, but still more to condemn in the measures of both. Self-love, and the love of dominion, have, in my opinion, influenced them all, and this will continue to be the case until human nature is renovated.” “A singular politician!” exclaimed Fleming, as he rose to depart—“but, we will renew the subject at another time. Mr. Brown, I shall expect you to tea.” “A still more singular christian,” said the quaker, with a smile. “Pray tell me, friend, how dost thou reconcile the doctrines of Christ, for whom thou appearest to have a great reverence, with thy notions of patriotism and military duties?” “My dear sir,” replied Willoughby, “there is not a man on earth, even the most zealous of your sect, that is more fully convinced than I am that all the wars which have ever desolated this fair globe of earth, have originated from `men's lusts which war in the members.' The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the fuel which evil spirits, by blasts from hell, too often kindle to an infernal blaze in the hearts of the children of men.” “How then canst thou conscientiously engage in them?” “Why, sir, in my opinion,” answered the major, “the true merits of the question must rest upon this point: is it lawful to resist the unjust aggressions of wicked men, in their mercenary or ambitious attempts to rob us of those inestimable blessings, and unalienable rights, which nature, or rather nature's God, has bestowed upon us, in order to promote our happiness, and the happiness of our posterity?” “Trust to God alone,” answered the quaker, “and he will protect them for us.” “Pardon me,” replied Willoughby; “would not that be like casting ourselves from the pinnacle of Solomon's temple, and trusting to God to give his angels charge to bear us up? This would be tempting God, as the devil wished our Saviour to tempt him, when he made that proposition, not knowing that he was addressing God himself. But permit me to illustrate my first position: That infernal spirits can only effect their evil designs, in this world, through the medium or agency of such unhappy mortals as have, previously, been brought under their wicked influence by passive compliance, is a truth, which no christian, I presume, will deny; and hence by a transposition as logical as any in algebra, the question before us, when stripped of all external terms and forms, appears to be this: Is it lawful, upon gospel principles, to arrest or oppose the movements of infernal spirits, in attempting to deprive us of those blessings which a bountiful and gracious Providence has bestowed upon us as men, or as christians?” “I would answer in the negative,” said the quaker. “Let every meek, just, and pious man, so oppressed, plead, rebuke, and remonstrate against the impropriety, impolicy, and injustice of such offenders; and to convince and turn the current of public opinion against them; which would, as it became general, sweep gradually their oppressors into the fathomless ocean. Religion is supernatural and checks self-defence.” “But self-defence, sir, is the first law of nature, it is a principle implanted in us by God for the preservation of our lives. It is this principle which prompts us to extend our hand when falling, or to guard off an impending blow; or, if that is out of our power, to disable the hand which is giving it. I still think, sir, that it would be tempting the Almighty to remain in either case perfectly passive, and trust to him for protection.” “I will grant,” replied Brown, “that self-defence is the first law of nature, but those who are united to that which is far superior to nature, have nothing to do with it—I mean those who are united to that which causes us, contrary to nature, to love our enemies. For God loved us while we were his enemies, and we, by loving them, become godlike and godly. He that loves his neighbour as himself cannot kill or plunder him, consequently cannot go to war with him.” “Show me a nation,” replied the major, “who are all, nearly all, or even a majority of them, united to Christ in the blessed union to which you allude, and I will grant that the celestial sphere which would in that case surround them, would repel a host of foes, and be to them a wall of impenetrable brass. But where is there such a nation?” “But has not persecution, when rightly borne, been advantageous to the cause of the oppressed;” asked the quaker, “and so much so, that the blood of the martyrs is proverbial, as being a seed to the church? If so, who need fear but that the Lord will help those who trust in his protection?” “I will admit it, sir,” replied Willoughby, “provided those who trust in him have so far become united to him by a good life as to deserve his protection. But with what face can an unregenerated wilful sinner say, `I trust to God for protection.' It is little less than blasphemy, for he has no right to claim or expect such protection —he has suffered himself to become an internal associate with evil spirits, and he must fight his way with their earthly representatives as well as he can. Will not the same observation apply to a nation of which a large majority are unrepenting violators of the divine law?” “Thy mode of reasoning is rather novel,” observed the quaker, “and perhaps I do not perfectly comprehend it. But tell me, friend, why was not the quaker administration of Pennsylvania attacked and plundered by the savages as were the fighting New-Englanders?” “That may be accounted for,” replied the major, “by that noble spirit of equity and sound policy towards the Indians in which William Penn founded his community; but, still, sir, on examining their history, we find that at Philadelphia there were commonly a few regular troops for the protection of the peaceable. And even under the government of the Penns, when there was a majority of quakers in the legislature, a sufficient number of them were obliged to resign, and non-quakers placed in their room, in order to vote some military supplies on a requisition of the executive of the province. Here was evidently an impracticable theory tested, and, as such, should have been abandoned as disorderly in its action.” “I am not prepared to controvert the fact, friend; but are not the precepts of the gospel expressly against taking up the sword?” “Yes, sir, and also expressly against disobedience to those in authority; therefore, if we suppose the command to obey those in authority sacred, and the command not to take up the sword sacred, it is evident that when the government orders its citizens out to defend their country, one of these two laws, both equally authoritative, must fall to the ground. So that herein an apparent incongruity is ascribed to the Scriptures, where, in fact, no such incongruity exists; for I believe that the divine law is adapted to three different states in man, viz. the state of wickedness in which he is by nature, and which, for distinction sake, I will term his natural state; a state of growing better, which I will distinguish by the term progressive; and the state of being positively good, (I mean a restoration to that paradisical state in which man was pronounced good by his Maker.) Now, sir, if you will allow me to use these three different terms, to distinguish the three different states predicable of man, I will proceed.” “I have no objection to the terms, friend,” replied the quaker, “and I must confess that in thy premises there seems to be something like method. Proceed.” “Admitting then,” continued the major, “that every man must be in one or another of these three states, either positively bad, growing better, or positively good, it must be allowed that a mode of conduct which would become him in one 6 of these states, would be highly absurd, and entirely out of order in another; for the divine law, embracing a threefold period of actions adapted to these three different states, provides within itself rules for each period respectively, and it is our duty to exercise our rationality in discriminating what is suitable and proper to our actual state, either as individuals, societies, or nations.” “I am all attention, friend—proceed.” “The precepts, then, of the gospel,” continued Willoughby, “embracing, as they do, three different states of progression, give to man an understanding and perception, in due order, of what is relative to his existing condition therein, beyond which, if he attempts to soar, he quickly becomes the victim of his temerity, by lapsing into enthusiasm. Thus the circumstance I have mentioned respecting the vote for military supplies, in the Pennsylvania legislature, may be deemed a successful exhibition and refutation of spiritual enthusiasm.” “But it is most certainly the duty of all men in all states to do right,” interrupted the quaker. “We are all called upon alike to imitate Christ who went about doing good. Does not this command apply to every state of man?” “Yes, sir, but if you review my premises, you will instantly perceive, that when a man in the lowest or natural state begins, from pure motives, to practise this command to do good, he then leaves the first and enters into the second state mentioned; he is then no longer in a natural but a progressive state, (as we agreed to call the two first) he is evidently growing better, and if he continues to obey the command in that state, until it becomes his greatest delight to do good, until it is his meat and drink to do his Master's will, he then passes into the highest state of the three, which we agreed to term paradisical, and then his regeneration is complete. We should certainly imitate Christ, but this imitation must be according to the practical order in which we are placed as parts of a whole; not as distinct integers in external things. For instance, in our imitation of the blessed Redeemer, it would be ridiculous and absurd to attempt the same things that were done by him, as to work miracles, walk on the sea, or die on the cross.” “We can at least imitate him in humility,” replied the quaker; “we can imitate him also in a reliance on divine protection. `Put up thy sword,' said he to Peter; `the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?” “You are right, sir,” returned the major, “as far as you go; but you stop short of the point we are aiming at. When our Lord caused his disciple to put up his sword, telling him, at the same time, that legions of angels were at his command, if he chose to call them to his assistance; we are instructed that it was agreeable to the divine providence that he should suffer, not resist; for in this he was the type of a future church whose members shall have all arrived at the third state, which we have termed paradisical; I say he was herein a type or figure of the paradisical man in his own future celestial church, when all shall submit themselves, without resistance, to his supreme power. But to attempt to practise this submission until we have attained that state, is out of order in individuals, and still more so in the government of a nation. At this day, and in our present low state as to goodness and truth, submission, on quaker principles, would be a direct acknowledgment of the authority of evil to govern comparative good, and force to govern wisdom, which, in my opinion, almost amounts to an avowed allegiance to the devil; (pardon my plainness) as if the right to reign was in him, and, therefore, we should unresistingly submit to his government.” “Thy reasoning appears to me strange and contradictory,” observed the quaker; “but give me leave to ask one plain question: Would not the extension of our principles eventually stop the ravages of war, and tend to introduce a millenium?” “It appears evident to me,” answered Willoughby, “that whenever good sense and sound discretion pervade a community generally, it must have a decided aversion to war. But we find that the quaker institution has not operated to prevent war; nay, it has operated the other way; for the Friends, by taking too high ground, have been less useful than they might otherwise have been, as a christian seet. It was not so with our Lord, who sat with publicans and sinners, that he might thus enjoy a fit opportunity for instructing them. Indeed, I speak from experience when I say that there is scarcely a situation where a religious man, if he has firmness and good sense, can be more in the way of doing good than in a camp.” “Thy remarks on this subject,” said the quaker rising, “are new and interesting, but not quite intelligible to my comprehension. But I will give them a due weight in my mind, and call on thee again to pursue the subject. But now the lateness of the hour compels me to depart. Farewell.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. DAWNING AFFECTION. Round Love's Elysian bowers The softest prospects rise; There bloom the sweetest flowers, There shine the purest skies; And joy and rapture gild awhile The cloudless heaven of Beauty's smile. Montgomery. Major Willoughby had resisted frequent solicitations from the maternal uncle of his children, who resided in Boston, to permit Amelia to pass a twelvemonth with his family in that metropolise. The great length of the journey, however, and their mutual reluctance to a separation, had been hitherto urged against the proposal. But it was now renewed with so much earnestness by every member of the Cushing family, and not being objected to by Amelia herself, it was agreed that when her brother repaired to New-England, to complete his preparation for entering Harvard University, Amelia should, at the same time, comply with the urgent wish of her mother's relatives. This event was to take place on the following spring. George was already a good classical scholar, and had, until lately, pursued his studies with unremitting industry and assiduity. Climbing trees and mountains had not in the least retarded them; hunting and fishing had not once interrupted them; his Indian associates and athletic exercises had never hindered or delayed the performance of a task or the getting of a lesson. 6* But, somehow, his harp, that fascinating harp, seemed now to engross his whole attention. O'Hara had agreed to give him three lessons a week; but George was at Fleming's at least once a day—probably to practise: but if I have any recollection of the nature of the human heart at that tender age, it was to practise a lesson never included in his contract with the old harper, or even thought of by the parties. Nay, the pupil himself was ignorant of the subject, nor ever dreamed what proficiency he was making, until this course of studies was interrupted. I have said that George became a poet to write songs for his sister; but I feel it my duty to add that these little juvenile productions were always sung first by Miss Catharine Fleming. Kate had a sweet voice, and it was very natural to try them by that ordeal before submitting them to the inspection of the right owner. To be sure, Amelia would sometimes express a little surprise at the uniform sameness of the subject, and archly observe, that had they come from any young man, save her brother, she should certainly have considered them as overtures of the tenderest regard. It is not easy to determine how these complimentary effusions were relished by the Hibernian lass, but she possessed too much good breeding to refuse rehearsing them when requested by George; such a refusal would have been rude, and nearly tantamount to condemning the pieces. And so, from a principle of politeness merely, she always sung them in her best style, while the poet performed an accompaniment on his harp. When George was not present she was always repeating them, without a second. The following is offered as a specimen. YES OR NO. The groves their vernal sweets have lost, No blossoms now perfume the gale, The lawns are silver'd o'er with frost, And autumn lingers in the vale. But do the seasons, as they roll, Affect the heart with joy and woe? Can autumn thus depress the soul? Or spring elate it?—yes, or no? The grove again shall yield its shade, And vernal sweets perfume the gale, The modest violet deck the glade, And richest verdure clothe the vale. But will the flower of hope survive, And gain from spring a brighter glow? A smile, sweet maid, would bid it thrive, Wilt thou bestow it?—yes, or no? The foregoing lines were sung extempore, by George, at the conclusion of a lesson, when no one was present but his old blind tutor and Catharine. The first verse went off unnoticed; but there was such a peculiar expression thrown into the last, that his lovely auditor raised her soft blue eyes from her needle, and met the ardent gaze of the poet. A sensation at once new and indescribable darted through her frame, raised a slight tremor in her bosom, and called the carnation to her cheek. George rose gently from his seat, and repeated in a softer tone and still more tender cadence, “Wilt thou bestow it?—yes, or no?” Her answer was a bewitching smile. In a sudden extacy he forgot himself and imprinted an impassioned kiss on her lips. Catharine dared not chide him, because that would have betrayed to her grand-father this little breach of decorum in his pupil. Her disposition was too gentle to bear anger, and she smiled her forgiveness on the spot; when, in George's hurry to express his gratitude, he inadvertently repeated the offence. Until this period George had exhibited no indications of a passion for the belles-lettres, and it was not without considerable surprise and regret that his father noticed the sudden and extraordinary metamorphosis. Logical disquisitions had given place to lighter exercises, and all internal excitements to action appeared to be at once transferred from the head to the heart. The investigation of the major and minor of a syllogism was less pleasing than the modulations of those two keys on his harp. The solution of a problem had become dull and tedious, while the construction of an acrostic or sonnet was productive of amusement and delight. Willoughby beheld in these unwelcome symptoms, if not the total frustration of his hopes, at least a dangerous innovation on his long-concerted plans. His scheme of education had been calculated to insure that energy of mind and strength of nerve which he considered indispensible in the cabinet or the field. To this end all his labors had been directed, for on this point all his wishes centered. Success kept pace with exertion, and promised to crown his brightest hopes. Every revolving month met his son nearer the goal; and no obstacle had retarded his speed—no allurement diverted his course. No wonder then that the anxious parent was grieved to witness his present aberration, to see him quit the race when the prize was almost within his reach. The major had always felt something like contempt for the profession of a poet, which he held in nearly the same light as Chesterfield held that of a fiddler. Pay them for their performances, (was the precept of both) but never perform yourself. “A modern poet,” he would sometimes say to his children, “always reminds me of the story of Little Red Ridinghood, who, being sent on an errand, sauntered from the high road into the fields, where she amused herself with chasing butterflies and plucking dandelions, until the approach of evening alarmed her, when she had to grope the remainder of her way in darkness, and the end of her journey was ruin.” Had the major been aware of the real cause of the change he lamented, it would have given him little or no uneasiness, for he would have thought it a mere temporary delirium, which the next summer's novelties would quickly dissipate in air. It would have given him no surprise to learn that the society of so charming a girl as Miss Fleming had produced such effects in the mind of a youth like George, who had been brought up in seclusion, without ever conversing with a female, save his sister and aunt. He would have recollected that Cupid often joins in the innocent gambols of childhood, and though not able to pierce the bosom with his dart, will often tickle the lips with its feather. Willoughby took an early opportunity of expostulating with his son on the frivolity of his present pursuits; and George, for the first time, listened to paternal advice with pain, and promised obedience with reluctance. The winter passed rapidly away, and all the beauties it had stolen from nature were soon restored by spring. The period was at hand for George to bid a long adieu to the scenes of his childhood, and both pleasure and pain were mingled in the contemplation of the event. His father and sister were to accompany him on the journey; but, his aunt—his harp—and Catharine were to be left behind. For several successive days previous to his departure, he had waited on the Flemings for the purpose of taking leave of the family; but had always returned without introducing the subject. He could not account for it, but he felt that every day increased the difficulty. He had never known the pain of parting with a dear friend, and he shrunk from the trial. But knowing the impossibility of avoiding it, he at length summoned resolution to meet it. “To-morrow I set out for New-England,” said he to Mr. Fleming, in a tone of assumed gaiety, as he rose to depart; “have you any commands?” “None, sir, I thank you; but accept my most sincere wishes that a pleasant journey and future prosperity may attend you.” “And do you leave us so soon?” asked Mrs. Fleming. “Indeed, Mr. Willoughby, we shall lack your society much.” “Nothing, madam, but duty could induce me to leave scenes which will always be so dear to my recollection, and to relinquish society to whom I am so fondly attached. But I hope to revisit them again at every autumn vacation.” Poor George! had he reflected on the shortness of the vacation, and the prodigious length of the journey, he would have expressed no such hope. “You and Catharine have been playmates together so long,” said Fleming, “that the poor girl will be quite lost without you. Will you not, my dear?” Catharine was marking a handkerchief for herself, had nearly completed the C, and was too intent on her work to reply. She, however, stole a side glance at George, which spoke a volume to his soul. He saw her tears, and his own voice faltered as he said, “I think, sir, that we shall not forget each other—at least I can answer for myself.” Catharine's needle flew still more rapidly. “And do you part with your friend so unceremoniously, my love?” asked her mother, surprised at her daughter's apparent inattention; “not even wish him a pleasant journey!” Her tears fell fast on her work. “What letter do you call that, my love,” enquired her father, with a smile—“a C or a G?” It was indeed a G, and the distressed girl hid her face in the handkerchief. George pitied her embarrassment, from his soul; and Mrs. Fleming began to suspect that her reproof had been malapropos. “Katy, my dear, you are ill!” “Who is ill?” cried O'Hara. “Come hither my darling, to your grand-father, and tell me what ails thee.” She darted to the old harper, clung round his neck, and wept aloud. “What is the matter, my little pet?” enquired the old man, alarmed at her convulsive sobs— who has hurt or ill-treated thee? Tell your own grand-father what the matter is!” “Nothing, sir, nothing at all; only I was—I had a little—I am not ill now, indeed I am not; I am quite well.” “Why, how your poor cheek burns!” continued the old man, “you have quite a fever, and tremble all over like a leaf. Your mother must put you to bed.” “This is the effect of your wild-goose-chase after a foolish bird,” observed Fleming, and then turning to George, he continued, “the mock-bird you gave her escaped from his cage, and Kate has been pursuing him over hedge and ditch the whole morning, and has probably caught cold. But the bird mocked her pursuit.” “And what could induce the little rogue to leave you?” cried George, now venturing to take her hand. “Because I loved him, I suppose,” answered she, smiling through her tears. “If you love him,” replied George, with a gentle pressure of the hand, “I am certain that he will return to you.” More was meant than met the ear, and the affectionate girl read it in his speaking eye. Her father had walked to the window, and she stood without the sphere of her mother's observation. It was a critical moment: if their lips were to meet in eighteen long months, now was the time; the request was made, and the assent given by the eyes alone; their lips did meet, just as Fleming was turning on his heel towards them. “I shall certainly claim it as my property,” cried George, affecting to have been speaking about the handkerchief; “since you have marked it with the initial of my name; and I will appeal to your father for the justice of my claim.” Fleming decided in his favor; but Catharine objected. “Consider it as a loan, then,” said George, “and I will leave my harp in pledge for its safe restoration.” Catharine had lost her bird, and began to fear that she should possess no visible token to remind her of her absent friend, when the last proposition was made. She therefore assented to it with more pleasure than she was willing to express. That handkerchief was still moist with the tears of affection, and George would have sooner parted with an eye than have relinquished it. Had she asked in return a kingly crown, like Flodoardo, he would have pledged himself to procure it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. THE JOURNEY. O how canst thou renounce the boundless store Of charms which nature to her votary yields: The warbling woodland, the resounding shore, The pomp of groves, and garniture of fields; All that the genial ray of morning gilds, All that the mountain's sheltering bosom yields, And all the dread magnificence of heaven: O how canst thou renounce, and hope to be forgiven? Beattie's Minstrel. On the twenty-fifth day of April, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ten, Major Willoughby, with his two children, commenced their journey. Willoughby and Amelia rode in a light covered waggon, drawn by a pair of young bay mares, and driven by a lad who had, for some 7 time, served them in capacity of cowherd and ostler. George was mounted on a spirited black gelding, which his father had given him on his last birth-day. The morning was fine, and the early flowers of spring were here and there peeping through the tender verdure that covered the earth. Their course was nearly east, and the sun, just emerging from the dusky forests before them, seemed a golden beacon to direct them. All nature was awake, vivified, and happy. The sound of the axe was heard from the woods, and every thicket was vocal with the matins of their feathered tenants. Our hero and his courser were both elated, and the whole party alive to the beauties around them. On the left, further than the eye could reach, was spread the unruffled waters of Erie, and on the right, the scene was pleasingly diversified with farms and cottages, leafy groves, and lengthened prairies, cornfields and orchards, hills and vallies. The lilac was in bloom, and its fragrance sweetened the air. They stopped to take leave of Fleming, whom they found alone in his garden; his wife and daughter were gone to the village, so that George, Catharine, and Amelia, were spared the pain of a formal parting. George dismounted and entered the house, where he found his old tutor playing his favorite Ad ccoidreac ma bin tu. They parted with mutual regret. The travellers proceeded on their journey. As they ascended a little eminence which was soon to conceal from their view the dear scenes of their childhood, George and Amelia often looked back, while various recollections crowded on their susceptible minds. The road began to descend, and the party continued sunk in musing silence for several miles. The major first awoke, struck with the wonderful improvements which the country exhibited. Fourteen years before, he had travelled over the same tract, when scarce a mark of civilization cheered his solitary way. Then, journeying with pack-horses, his party could scarcely penetrate the dark and tangled forests, or ford the impetuous streams. Now all was changed. A good road was levelled before them, and the streams were arched with substantial bridges. He was prepared to behold a great alteration, but it far exceeded his anticipations. The yell of the savage had given place to the cheerful note of industry; the solitary canoe of the Indian was no longer seen stealing along the bank of a river in quest of his game; but instead thereof, vessels of considerable magnitude, loaded with the produce of the soil, were sailing majestically towards the lake, destined for the Canadian market. They had provided a stock of provisions in the carriage, as a remedy against the probable scarcity of inns on this unfrequented road, so that they might take refreshment on any pleasant spot, in the open air; but for lodging they depended on the hospitality of the scattered settlers. Soon after mid-day they reached the banks of Chagrin River, on which they found a most beautiful spot, where they alighted for refreshment and repose. A spring of pure water gushed from the foot of a rock, and after meandering over a path of gravel, fell into the bosom of the river. A natural shelf, on the side of this rock, served them for a table, and banks of moss furnished them with seats far richer than velvet. Their repast was moistened with some exhilirating American wine, from the vineyards of New-Switzerland, in the Indiana Territory, where the enterprising Swiss emigrants had been very successful in its manufacture. At a short distance below them was a fine farm, and an orchard of thriving fruit trees; herds of cattle were seen reposing in the shade, or browzing in the thicket; the rapid clicking of a distant mill, serenaded them on one hand, and the tinkling of a sheep-bell was heard on the other. After finishing their meal, and feeding their horses, they resumed their journey along the banks of this rapid stream, to an indifferent bridge, on which they crossed, and travelled onward through a country more thickly settled than any they had yet passed, since leaving the vicinity of Cayahoga. Lake Erie was no longer visible, the road lying about three miles from its shores; but the sylvan prospect still continued delightful. In a few hours they reached the bank of Grand-River, where they found a commodious inn, at which they determined to pass the night. Here they met with a venerable old missionary from New-England, who had been on a visit to New-Salem, a Moravian settlement of Christian Indians, on the western bank of Huron-River, about forty miles from Mulberry-Grove. He was now on his return, but had been detained several days at Grand-River, by an attack of the fever and ague. He was, however, so far recovered, as to be able to proceed in company with the Willoughby party, who resumed their journey on the following morning. Their road lay along the left bank of the river, to the lake shore, of which they now had a beautiful and uninterrupted view. Here they crossed the river on a handsome wooden bridge, and proceeded along the margin of the lake, on a road of sand—level, smooth, and so firm, that their horses feet left no traces in its unyielding surface. The morning was clear and beautiful, the lake unruffled, and the road delightful. High on their right, rose the almost inaccessible bank, like a wall or parapet, varying in its height from thirty to seventy feet, and extending, both before and behind them, as far as the eye could reach. For above fourteen miles no human habitation saluted their view. The good old missionary was a valuable acquisition to the party; his conversation was improving and entertaining, and he appeared to be perfectly well acquainted with the road they were travelling; describing every prominent feature of the country, between Cleveland and Erie. He gave his companions a brief history of the people to whom he had been preaching, and related many ancedotes which had occurred during his stay among them. He also described many natural curiosities, and Indian antiquities, which he had visited and inspected; among the latter, he mentioned the numerous remains of ancient fortifications, with which the western country abounds, burrows for the dead, images, inscriptions, and curious utensils. The most of these, however, were familiar to his auditors. “The fortified camps,” observed the missionary. “I consider the greatest curiosity of all, and am sometimes almost induced to believe that nations have existed in this country, all traces of whom are now lost. At any rate, we are certain that the erection of such works as those appear 7* to have been, was never the result of savage ingenuity or labor. What is your opinion, Major?” “On this subject,” replied Willoughby, “conjecture may weary itself in vain. At what period, by what people, and for what purpose, these works were constructed, no one living can inform us. The oldest natives have lost all tradition respecting them, and their history must for ever lie buried in oblivion.” “One tradition respecting them,” replied the missionary, “is yet extant among the tribe with whom I have been residing. It is by them believed, that some thousand moons ago, their forefathers had become so monstrously degenerate, and abominably wicked, that the Great Spirit sent an entirely new species of beasts among them, which destroyed them by thousands; and their description of these animals exactly corresponds with the skeleton of the mammoth, several of which, you know, have been dug up in different parts of the western country. The number of these monsters, they say, was small, but their size and strength so prodigious, that a whole family would scarcely serve as a breakfast for the least of them; and such was the extent of their ravages, that the world was rapidly becoming depopulated. “In the midst of the general consternation, one old sachem alone, esteemed by his tribe as a prophet, appeared cool, collected, and undismayed. He had often exhorted them to abstain from their enormities, and had predicted the punishment which their evil deeds were drawing upon their devoted race. But they heeded him not, until too fatally convinced of their folly. He now preached to them with more effect and success, and persuaded them to repent of their misdeeds, reform their lives, and boldly unite in a system of defence against the common enemy, instead of deserting their wigwams, and leaving their squaws and papooses a prey to the ruthless devourers. They listened to his remonstrances, and all united in the work of defence, with so much industry and zeal, that in a few days a hundred of these forts were erected and provisioned, into which they all retreated on the next approach of the enemy, and there sustained a regular siege, until their besiegers famished for the want of food.” “And could not those mighty animals carry such a fortress by storm?” asked George with a smile. “I think not,” replied the missionary. “If you ever visit Peale's Museum, in Philadelphia, and examine the skeleton of the mammoth, you will think so too. He must have been even more unwieldy than the elephant, which, I believe, has never been celebrated for his agility in leaping. No, sir; allowing the tradition to be founded on fact, the poor mammoth must have stood gazing wishfully over the wall, and starved with plenty in view. They say that he was created expressly to prey on man, and that human flesh was his only food. If such was the case, he must have circumambulated the parapet in despair; feasting his eyes with dainties, which were beyond the reach of his jaws.” “If it was thus that the race became extinct, how happens it,” asked George, “that their bones are not always found near these fortifications?” “That is also accounted for,” returned the missionary. “It is supposed that many of them, as a last resort, applied to the salt-licks for relief, and there expired; and it is thought by some, that all wild animals resort thither, merely for the medicinal virtues contained in the salt. One late traveller, indeed, has gone so far as to assert that the air of this state is `impregnated with a poisonous exhalation, so offensive, even to the brute creation, as to compel them to migrate several hundred miles, annually, in search of an antidote, which he takes to be the real cause of their visits to the salt-licks and springs.” “The travels of Mr. Ashe,” replied Willoughby, “lately published in some of the eastern states, from which your quotation is made, is a work calculated to give very erroneous impressions to the minds of foreigners, and for that purpose alone was it written; a pitiful attempt, among many others, to arrest the current of emigration. We who reside in the regions he affects to describe, know the work to be a tissue of falsehood and contradiction, and I lament the prostitution of that press through which it has gained its ephemeral existence.” “You express yourself, sir, rather warmly on the subject,” observed the missionary; “but I agree with you in opinion; and could easily point out to your recollection a gross libel for every page. The investigation, however, would furnish no reward for the trouble.” By this time our travellers had reached an aperture in the palisade which led into the country, and a plantation opened on their view. Here they stopped to feed their horses, and partake of some refreshment. They then again set forward, still pursuing their journey along the banks of the lake, and, about sun-set, arrived at Ashtabula-River, which they crossed in a large flat-bottomed boat, and were hospitably entertained, at the boatman's house, on the opposite bank. On the morning they resumed their journey, and, after travelling about seventeen miles, entered the state of Pennsylvania. Here the country gradually became more elevated, the settlements more numerous, and the roads far better. Towards the close of the day, they reached a beautiful turnpike, which led them to the town of Erie, where they arrived at about eight o'clock in the evening. Here Major Willoughby found a distant relation, with whom he had frequently corresponded, and who was so rejoiced to see the party, that he insisted on their spending a week at his house. This invitation was, however, declined, and after reposing two days beneath his hospitable roof, and taking leave of their fellow traveller, they again set forward, and arrived at Maysville, a thriving little village at the head of Chataque Lake, in the state of New-York. This beautiful lake is about eighteen miles in length, and about three in width, surrounded by groves of oak, chesnut, and hickory, here and there interspersed with cottages and farms; the face of the country agreeably undulated with gentle swells and fertile vallies, and well watered with springs and brooks. On the following morning they left this village, and proceeded, on an indifferent road, towards Bath, a post-town in Steuben county, a distance of more than one hundred miles, which they reached on the third day, at noon, and where they again enjoyed a few hours' repose. From Bath they travelled through Catharine's Town to Ithaea, a small village of about fifty houses, near the south end of Cayuga Lake. Here they reposed one night, and then proceeded, on a fine new turnpike, to Owego, a considerable town in Broome county, where they dined, and arrived at Unadilla late in the evening. This was the most pleasant route they had yet travelled, being along the banks of the Susquehanna River, abounding with beautiful and romantic scenery. The next morning they continued their course on the Appian Way Turnpike, which stretches among the lofty hills through which the Susquehanna flows, and crossed that delightful stream at the Great Bend, where stands a handsome little village; then travelled through the valley formed by the Salt Lick Creek, and left the river far behind them. After crossing the north-east corner of Pennsylvania state, and the river Delaware, they slept at Bethel, in Sullivan County. On the following evening they arrived at the village of Newburgh, pleasantly situated on the bank of the majestic Hudson. Here the major sold his rustic equipage, and George was, with great reluctance, persuaded to part with his favorite horse. The mode of travelling, however, in this part of the country, had become so easy and delightful, that the remainder of their journey required no such auxiliaries. They embarked on board of the North River Steam-boat, on the following morning, for New-York. The admiration of our back-woods party was considerably excited on seeing the “huge canoe” propelled along by the irresistible power of steam; but their attention was soon diverted from the wonders of art to the beauties of nature, who appears to have chosen the borders of this stream for the boldest strokes of her pencil. The rude and solitary grandeur of West-Point, inspired George and Amelia with ideas of sublimity which the shores of Lake Erie had never suggested. With the rocks near the mouth of Cayahoga,[4] [4] Col. Broadshead suffered shipwreck here in the Revolutionary war, and lost a number of his men, when a strong wind arose, so that the last canoe narrowly escaped. The heathen Indians, when they pass this impending danger, offer a sacrifice of tobacco to the water. which for several miles project over the lake, rising seventy feet perpendicular from the water, they were indeed familiar; but their effect was not so striking as that produced by the present scene. What they now beheld was a fit subject for the pencil of a Salvator, or the pen of a Radcliffe: “Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic spell, “Here scorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.” To Willoughby the scene was familiar, and recalled to his mind events that were long past, while he pointed out the interesting objects to his children. There stood the fortress from whose impregnable walls the storm of war was rolled back upon our invaders; where the traitor Arnold plotted his country's ruin, and where the patriot Washington toiled for her safety. The narrator's bosom glowed with sensations to which he had for some time been a stranger, and the manly tear trembled in his noble eye. As they glided along between these stupendous piles of mountains, a kind of silent awe insensibly crept through the hearts of our admiring young strangers; a feeling which the sullen majesty of the scene is admirably fitted to inspire. The “banner of freedom” was waving in the clouds, above the frowning ramparts of Fort Clinton; and George's bosom bounded with a sudden glow of enthusiasm as it caught his eye. At that moment the distant roll of the drum floated to his ear, and he shouted his feelings in a rapturous huzza! As they proceeded down the river, his father pointed out the spot where the Vulture, a British sloop of war, had been stationed, to facilitate the treasonable negociations of Arnold, and where the unfortunate Major Andre had been landed to communicate with the traitor. Fortunately for America, but unhappily for the gallant Andre, the Vulture shifted her position while he was on shore, and the boatmen refused to conduct him on board, as she lay exposed to the fire of a cannon which had been sent to annoy her. In attempting to effect his escape by land, he was taken, and suffered death as a spy. Arnold escaped on board the Vulture, and was conveyed to New-York, then occupied by the enemy. In a few hours our travellers found themselves in the first commercial city in the United States, where they tarried long enough to adapt their costume to the prevailing fashion, to visit the public places of amusement, and to inspect every object calculated to excite or gratify curiosity. On the twentieth day of May they embarked on board a New-England packet, and after a pleasant voyage of twelve hours, arrived at Newport, in the state of Rhode-Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. SPRIGS OF LAUREL. Sons of the deep, ye spirits brave! 'Tis yours to build Columbia's fame; To prove her rights on ocean's wave, And spread a balo round her name. Skilful and bold, by labor nursed, By honor taught, by hardship tried; In danger and in glory first, Your country's hope, her joy, her pride. Anon. At Newport, Willoughby found several old friends, some of whom had been his companions in arms, and this circumstance induced him to suspend his journey for a week. With the Hon. Christopher G. Champlin, a member of Congress, he had been very intimate in his youth, and the renewal of that intimacy now gave them reciprocal pleasure. In the mean time Amelia formed a very pleasing acquaintance with his lovely neice, Miss Eliza Mason. This amiable and interesting young lady was addressed by a lover to whom she was affianced, and the tenderest attachment existed between them. The name of this happy youth was Perry, an officer in the United States navy, about twenty-four years old. To a manly deportment, and decisive firmness of character, he united an amiable disposition, unassuming address, and prepossessing appearance. Though early launched among the familiar scenes of naval life, (and no where is familiarity more apt to be licentious and encroaching) yet his native gentility and sober dignity of demeanor, had always chastened without restraining the freedom of intimacy. 8 Moral excellence, high-minded courtesy, and pure unsullied honor, were the sterling ingredients which composed his character. George saw, appreciated, and loved. He felt himself irresistibly drawn to a being whose soul seemed the repository of every noble virtue; and on retiring from his first interview, he exclaimed to his father with enthusiasm, “that man was born, sir, for a Champion of Freedom.” If his first impression was thus favorable to the object of his admiration, a few days' intimacy heightened it to the warmest and purest friendship, and George secretly wished that his father had seen fit to place him also in the way of acquiring naval renown. Lieut. Perry was actually descended, on the maternal side, from the Wallaces, so celebrated in the annals of Scotland, and he would have borne the name of William Wallace, had not the sudden death of a beloved uncle induced his parents to change it. His mother, though of Scotch extraction, was born in Ireland, and married in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four, to Raymond H. Perry, esq. who had taken an active part, both by sea and land, in the cause of American freedom. This excellent woman had devoted herself to the education of her children, and formed their youthful minds to early habits of virtue and religion. So successful had she been in these attempts, that neither his thirst for glory, nor the bustle of a naval life, were able to seduce the mind of Lieut. Perry from the salutary impressions which he received in early youth. At the age of fourteen he had entered the service as a midshipman, on board the General Greene, then commanded by his father. When that ship went out of commission he was transferred to a squadron destined for the Mediterranean, where he served during the Tripolitan war. His extreme youth prevented his having an opportunity of distinguishing himself; but the faithfulness and intelligence with which he discharged the duties of his station, recommended him greatly to the favor of his superior officers; whilst his private virtues, and the manly dignity of his deportment, commanded the friendship and respect of his associates. On returning from the Mediterranean, he continued sedulously attentive to his profession, and though the reduction of the navy, and the neglect into which it had now fallen, disheartened many of the officers, and occasioned several to resign, yet he determined to adhere to its fortunes, confident that it must, at some future period, rise to importance. He now commanded the Revenge, and was employed in cruising along the coast, to enforce the embargo law. Such was lieutenant Perry when introduced to our “back-woods” travellers, and so assiduous was he that the period of their stay in Newport should be agreeably filled up, that scarce a day or evening passed, without their joining some party of amusement created by his influence, so that the intended week was actually extended to a fortnight. It was here that our young foresters were first initiated into the sphere of genuine refinement, and began to assume the fascinating blandishments of polite life. But the ground-work was so excellent, that it rather imparted grace to the embroidery, than received attractions from it. After passing two weeks in the most agreeable intercourse, our travellers, on the fourth of June, bade their new friends an affectionate adieu, and reached Providence the same evening. Here the major had previously agreed, by letter, to spend a few days with an old friend and brother-soldier, who had been a fellow-laborer with him through the whole of the arduous struggle for American Independence. The name of this veteran was Allen, who had been early appointed a first lieutenant in the revolutionary army, and was actively engaged in most of the battles which were fought during the war. He commanded the Rhode-Island line of troops at the battle of Saratoga, when he was advanced to the rank of major; and, since the peace, had been appointed, by the legislature of his state, brigadier-general of militia. His lady was the governor's sister, and possessed an amiable disposition, and captivating manners. The reception of Willoughby was such as might be expected, after so long a separation. While he chose to remain in town with his children, it was insisted that the general's house should be their quarters, and nothing was neglected that might conduce to the happiness of their situation. The general's son, William Henry, who was now on a short furlough to visit his friends, was a lieutenant in the navy, and attached to the frigate United States, under the command of commodore Decatur. He was now, apparently, about twenty-four years of age, with a combination of gallantry, grace, and intrepidity in his character, that irresistibly attracted the heart of George. Perhaps a more polished and polite sailor never trod the deck of a ship. In the hour of danger, he had already proved himself calm, intrepid, and persevering; in private intercourse, he was guarded, affable, and delicate. Glory was the mistress of his soul, and he panted for an opportunity to woo her in the cannon's mouth. Notwithstanding the present youth and rusticity of George Willoughby, there was something in his countenance and manners that bespoke a real greatness of soul; this was quickly discerned by young Allen, and a cordial intimacy was the consequence; which, short as it was, kindled into a flame, a spark that had long been smothering in the bosom of George. When Allen recounted some of his adventures in the Mediterranean, during the Tripolitan war, the natural disposition of our hero would burst through all restraint, and his enthusiasm draw smiles from every spectator. “O that I could enter the navy!” was then the first wish of his bosom. But he knew that his father would listen to no such proposal, until his education was completed, and this consideration alone, prevented his making the request. It had always been the intention of General Allen, that Henry should receive a liberal education, who, for this purpose, went through the preparatory studies. He panted, however, for more active life, and, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his parents, entered the navy, as a midshipman, in the year eighteen hundred. In three months after his appointment, he was ordered on board the frigate George Washington, [5] [5] See Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 2. commanded by captain Bainbridge, to carry 8* presents to the dey of Algiers. On his departure, he wrote to his father, “I now bid you a short adieu; but, should it be the last, you shall have the satisfaction to hear of my good conduct, in my station, as an officer and as a gentleman.” This cruise was attended with peculiarity of incident. The demand of the dey of Algiers, that the frigate should be employed in carrying his presents to the grand seignor at Constantinople, and the unavailing reluctance and remonstrances of captain Bainbridge, are circumstances generally known. It was the first time that the flag of an American frigate had waved in the harbor of Constantinople. The fine order of the ship, and the excellent discipline observed amongst the officers and men, tended to impress very high ideas of the American character, in a quarter of the world were before it was unknown. On the nineteenth of April, in the following year, young Allen again hailed the verdant landscapes of his native country; and, while he was solacing himself in the hope of once more visiting his family and friends, he was ordered on board the Philadelphia, under the command of captain Baron, to scour the Mediterranean sea again, from whence he returned after a cruise of fifteen months; and before the expiration of the year eighteen hundred and six, had returned from his fourth cruise in the same classical regions. During these different voyages, he visited many objects of curiosity, both of nature and art. He ascended Mount ætna, in company with commodore Rodgers, and, in returning, they lost their way amongst fields of lava, but were found by the monks in the convents below. He likewise visited Mount Vesuvius, and the cities of Herculaneum and Pompcia, besides many of the public buildings in the different cities on the shores of the Mediterranean. In February, eighteen hundred and seven, he received orders from government to join the frigate Chesapeake, commanded by captain Baron, then fitting out at Washington, for carrying supplies to the Mediterranean squadron. He remained in Philadelphia while the ship was preparing for sea, during which time he was busily employed in recruiting men for the service, and then entered as third lieutenant. At the time of the sailing of this ship, the United States were at peace with all the world, and the Chesapeake was intended rather as a store-ship than a cruiser. Besides the supplies she carried, she was much burthened with the luggage of passengers, among whom were two ladies, with their servants. Captain Baron was aware that his ship was not in fit condition to proceed to sea; but, trusting to the circumstance that the country was in profound peace, he unfortunately sailed, unprepared as he was, calculating that he should be enabled, long before he reached the European shores, to have his ship put in order. What a mistaken, imprudent, fatal security! Two British seventy-fours, the Bellona and Triumph; the Leopard, carrying fifty guns, and the Melampus, thirty-eight—under the command of commodore Douglass, were lying in Lynnhaven-bay. They were freely receiving, from our country, supplies of every kind of which they stood in need; they were partaking largely of the hospitality of its inhabitants; yet, at this moment, commodore Douglass held in his possession an order from his admiral, to take, forcibly, out of the Chesapeake, a part of her crew; and he was meditating to execute this offensive order, in a manner the most irritating to our country, and the most derogatory to our navy. Had the object of commodore Douglass been simply to take the men, and to produce the least possible irritation, he would, most obviously, have followed the Chesapeake out to sea with his whole force, and there would then, perhaps, have been no reproach on the navy, had she surrendered without firing a gun. Commodore Douglass dared not send the Melampus, as she was a frigate of the same class with the Chesapeake, and might, therefore, not have succeeded. The Leopard was sent: she was of force to insure to the British success, even had the Chesapeake been in complete order; and yet the force was not so overbearing but that the Chesapeake ought to have fought; and had she not fought, and fought well, the navy would have been disgraced. The navy was disgraced. The Chesapeake was boarded by an officer from the Leopard, with a written demand, which the American commandant knew he must absolutely and positively refuse; and which he did refuse, without, however, making any preparation to support his refusal with force. He should have detained the boarding officer, and ordered his men to beat to quarters. A full half hour elapsed, from the receipt of this demand before an answer was composed, written, and copied, and in that time the ship might have been nearly prepared for action. But all the officers remained ignorant of the contents of the note, and no preparation was made. The first gun was fired from the Leopard before the key of the Chesapeake's magazine was delivered to the gunner. Allen was at the galley, and, snatching a coal from the flames, fired the only gun which was discharged, and which pierced the ward-room of the Leopard. At that moment a shot from the Leopard struck a man on the breast, who fell at Allen's feet, covering him with blood, and splinters of bones. One man had his leg carried away, two an arm each, and two more were wounded severely—five out of the eight whom Allen had collected at this gun. The colours were then struck, by order of the captain, who called his officers into the cabin, and asked their opinions. Allen's answer was, “Sir, you have disgraced us!” Although three years had elapsed since this event, young Allen could not speak on the subject with composure. In relating the circumstance to George, he broke forth into the following exclamation: “To see so many brave men standing to their quarters, amidst the blood of their butchered and wounded countrymen, and hear their cries, without the means of avenging them! and when, in three minutes we could have avenged them! to have the flag of my country disgraced! Was it for this that I had continued so long in the service, contrary to the wishes of all my friends! To be so mortified, humbled, cut to the soul! Yes, to have the finger of scorn pointing at me as one of the officers of the Chesapeake! But do not think, my friend, that I feel that I have not done my duty. Perish the thought! I proudly feel that I would have willingly given my trifling life, an offering for the wounded honor of my country. But, when I act like Baron, may I die, unpitied and forgotten, and no tear be shed to my memory. May I lie on some barren shore, and may my bones whiten in the sun, be pelted by the pitiless storm, and may the name of Allen be blasted with infamy.” At the request of the officers of the Chesapeake, in a letter, drawn up by Allen, to the secretary of the navy, a court-martial was convened, and, after a patient hearing, commodore Baron was divested of his commission. On leaving the ship, all the officers were called on deck to witness his departure, a respect always paid to the commander, when entering or departing from his vessel. He now left her, passing through a line of officers: but no tear of regret was shed— every brow was contracted, every countenance was stern; and captain Baron, beholding the repulsive looks of his officers, fainted. Intrepidity, however, was not the only excellence in the character of lieutenant Allen; his private affections were as warm as his public. Though his mind was at times inflamed by a sense of indignant sensibility, that prompted him to pour into the ear of masculine confidence the complaints of his lacerated mind, in his intercourse with the gentle circle that surrounded his paternal hearth, his conversation was replete with domestic tenderness and affection. When in company with the fair, he could enter into all the innocent levities of ordinary converse, and seemed as anxious to veil his heroic and indignant passions, as if this indulgence was criminal in such intercourse. Notwithstanding the ocean mania with which George Willoughby was affected, by the conversation and manners of his new friend, it was soon dissipated; for on the second evening of their stay at the general's, the two old veterans “fought all their battles o'er again,” and kindled in George's bosom as ardent a desire to storm an embattled parapet, as he had just before felt to board a frigate from the yard-arm. A hero he was resolved to be—no matter where or how. The last impression was in favor of the army. In the course of the conversation, the name of Andre was mentioned, and the general was sensibly affected. He had been entrusted with the charge of that unfortunate but gallant officer, while under sentence of death; and sat up with him the whole night previous to his execution. Andre conversed with him on a variety of subjects, in which he uniformly spoke of the American character in terms of the strongest respect, and expressed his gratitude for the kindness and delicacy with which he was treated during his confinement. So affecting was this interview to Allen, that he could never relate the circumstance without great emotion.[6] [6] See Port Folio, vol. iii. p. 2.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. BOSTON. Cradle of Freedom! whose propitious birth Was bless'd by Heaven, and hail'd with joy by earth; Thy happy sons first hail'd her from the skies, And bade the flame upon her altar rise, Though tyrants threatened and their slaves reviled, While merciless Heroes sought to slay the child, Still undismayed, her banner she unfurl'd, And gave a Nation to the admiring world. Anon. On the eighth day of June, in the year one thousand eight hundred and ten, Major Willoughby, with his two children, entered the metropolis of Massachusetts, after an absence of fourteen years. I shall not attempt to detail the various recollections which now crowded on his mind, nor describe the sensations which they produced in his bosom. He was silent and contemplative, as the carriage rattled over the pavements of Cornhill, while George and Amelia were animated with present novelty, and anticipated enjoyment. Their fatiguing journey was terminated, and all its little perils forgotten, in the happy meeting of long-parted friends. Major Willoughby immediately commenced the requisite arrangements respecting his children, who were both placed under the care of their uncle, and the necessary tutors provided for finishing their education. The commencement, at Harvard University, was to take place on the twenty-ninth of August, and, on the nineteenth of the following month, which would terminate the vacation, George was to begin his collegiate course of studies, provided his application, in the mean time, should qualify him to pass the customary examination. After arranging these plans, and spending a few weeks in Boston, the major took an affectionate leave of his children and friends, and returned, in safety, to Mulberry-grove. The family, to which the reader is now about to be introduced, and with whom our hero and his sister resided, was of the first class in the town of Boston. Mr. Cushing was a merchant of very extensive connexions, and the “golden days of commercial prosperity” had blest him with an ample fortune; his wife was the most amiable of women, and their daughter, Ellen, every thing the fond parent could wish. She was an only child, had acquired every accomplishment that a genteel education could bestow, and, if she possessed a fault, it was the too free indulgence of an uncommon vivacity. George now applied to his studies with all his former ardor, and so intense was his application, that nothing else could divert his attention. The entreaties of his uncle and aunt, the advice of his sister, and the attractions of his volatile cousin, all combined, could seldom entice him from his books, or draw him into a party of pleasure. The town amusements possessed no charms for his studious and contemplative mind, for they bore no similitude to his former recreations. Whenever he did emerge from his closet, (or, as Ellen chose to call it, his den) it was to fly far from the ceaseless tumult that distracted his attention. On the verdant banks of Charles-river, hr could catch some traces of the paradise he had left, pursue his meditations in quiet, and give ample scope to his poetic fancy. Here he would 9 stroll for hours, watch the setting sun, sigh for his harp, and think upon Catharine. Amelia and Ellen were sometimes his companions in these rural excursions; but he more frequently enjoyed them in solitude, with Homer, Horace, or Plutarch in his hand. Amelia expressed her apprehensions for his health, and his cousin was fearful for his brain; she called him her hermit, her savage, and her Adonis, and would gravely entreat him to become “civilized, humanized, and christianized.” George answered her raillery with a smile, but continued his favorite pursuits, until they were interrupted by his removal to Cambridge. A regular correspondence had been settled between major Willoughby and his children, and scarcely a week elapsed without a letter from Mulberry-grove, filled with the most affectionate advice respecting their education and conduct in life. From one of them I have been permitted to make the following extract: “I am happy, my dear boy, to learn from your last, dated at Cambridge, that you have at length formally entered the first literary institution in the United States. In this new situation you will doubtless feel and exhibit a little awkwardness at first; but this will gradually wear away, until you find yourself perfectly at home. I feel no fears for you on this head, and but few on any other. Continue to cherish those sentiments of virtue and honor for which I have so often commended you, and not only my hopes, but my warmest wishes will be realized. “One thing, however, I feel it my duty to observe, viz. that though there is no situation in life entirely exempt from temptations, (because, we are all born with more or less propensities to evil—the sad effects of man's dreadful fall) yet those you have hitherto had to contend with are trifling, compared with what you must encounter in the world, on which you are now entering. It behoves you, therefore, to be ever on your guard, nor suffer the citadel of virtue to be taken by surprise. “In selecting your companions, and, above all, in the choice of an intimate friend, too much circumspection cannot be used. On this subject I have already written much, but it is a matter of such great importance, that it cannot be too often nor too earnestly recommended. Reputation, fortune, happiness, all depend upon it. A thoughtless or an imprudent choice, is the fatal rock on which too many split. Before you take any one to your bosom or admit him to your confidence, be certain that he is neither an infidel nor a libertine. Study his motives, his propensities, and his temper; the affections of his heart, and the occupation of his intellect. Become perfectly acquainted with his disposition, and sift his character to the bottom. Should you find yourself once deceived, let it double your circumspection, and never parly with the devil after discovering his cloven-foot. “There is one subject on which I have said but little, and that is, politics. Your secluded situation, I presume, has hitherto preserved your mind from any undue prejudices against either of the two great political parties which exist in our country. But you are now moving in a sphere in which you will be frequently called upon to express a decided opinion on the subject. This you may do without belonging to either side. Preserve your independence, and never forget that there are good men in all classes, as well as bad; that genuine patriotism exists in every section of the Union, and is not the exclusive virtue of any party, and that you may be a friend and champion of Freedom, without wearing a badge of political distinction. Possess opinions of your own on all subjects, and express them, when necessary, with moderation and firmness. God has given you reason, and it will be an unpardonable abuse of his bounty, to let another control it. Beware of prejudice and bigotry— they bespeak a weak mind; weigh with coolness and deliberation the relative merits of every question before you pass a final decision, and never suffer yourself to become the slave or the tool of a sect or a party. “Remember the following: “Love your God above all beings, your religion above all things, your country above all nations, your friends above all men, your family next, and yourself last. “Whoever strictly adheres to these rules, and shapes his conduct accordingly, must be a good politician, and a good man, whatever be his religious or political creed; for `His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.' “The farewell address of our beloved Washington, read next to your Bible. Make that your political creed, and you cannot err in your political conduct. `Frown indignantly on the first dawning of an attempt to alienate any portion of this country from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred ties which now link its various parts.' “This is the language of that god-like man, the friend of your father, and the father of his country. To me, there is a charm in the name of Washington that I can neither account for nor describe. In the deepest solitude I love to repeat it and dwell upon the sound; it is more fascinating to my ear than the sweetest music. An elegant writer, in a work now before me, expresses his own feelings on the same subject in the following words: `The character of that wonderful man, equally above the reach of detraction and praise, is, literally, novum monumentum in terris—a new and unheard of monument on earth. With the beams of glory playing around it, its basis is an empire, its top is in the heavens. It throws its effulgence on the remotest nations, and is a beacon-light for the direction of virtuous ambition. In contemplating an object so stupendous and dazzling, Panegyric becomes dumb, Imagination abandons her search after imagery, and Fancy throws aside her colors in despair. The pen and the pencil were formed for common purposes—for the portraying and decoration of common subjects. But the character of Washington, passing the widest boundaries of nature, swells to a prodigy, and is all but miraculous.'[7] [7] Editor of the Port Folio. `No monarch, on his throne,' says Inchiquin, `was ever so great as Washington in his retirement.' “A few words more on politics, and I have done. Always bear in mind that the ruler of any and every nation, represents, for the time being, the Governor of the Universe, in his kingly capacity. Never, therefore, be guilty of disrespect 9* to this his representative character, whatever may be your opinion of the man. Shun that politician, of either party, who thinks it no impiety to damn the president: such a man is in grain a rebel, let his external patriotism appear ever so conspicuous. This remark applies to every government under heaven, but in a peculiar manner to this free republic, where our rulers are appointed by a majority of the ruled. The president of the United States, therefore, not only represents, in common with kings, the Governor of the Universe, but he represents him conjoined to his church on earth; for those citizens whose free suffrages elect a ruler, stand in the same relation to that ruler that the christian church does to its divine head; for, by their own free suffrages do the regenerate choose Christ as their king. “But though you should be induced to give a decided preference to one or the other of our political parties, never enlist your passions in the cause you espouse, for that would be like commencing a military operation with an undisciplined rabble of disorganizing outlaws and traitors: your own defeat will be the certain consequence. Harvard University is scarcely disrobed of the habiliments of mourning, for the untimely fate of a most promising youth—an amiable, but rash victim to the demon of party. The story of young Austin is fresh in the recollection of all, and is a melancholy comment on the weakness of human nature, when unsupported by a true sense of religion. “He was a student, like yourself, but in which class I do not recollect; I only know that he acquired great applause for his application and proficiency. Some political newspaper squib, of a personal nature, of which his father was the avowed author, drew a challenge from the offended party, (Selfridge, an attorney at law) which being rejected by the elder Austin, the latter was posted for a coward. Indignant at this imaginary disgrace of his father, young Austin flew to Boston, met the challenger on the public exchange, and undertook to cane him on the spot. Selfridge received a blow on the head, and then shot his assailant through the heart, who fell on the pavement, weltering in his blood, and expired. Behold the effects of an intemperate attachment to either party! Here was a young man, cut off in the morning of life, with the most flattering prospects around him, leaving a large circle of relations and friends to lament the disastrous event. You may learn the particulars of this awful tragedy from almost any member of the university, or of your friends in Boston. Perhaps you have already read the trial of Selfridge, who was arraigned for manslaughter, and acquitted. I found a copy among some books I purchased while in Boston. “Malignant party spirit has been aptly compared to the Bohon Upas, or poison tree of Java, and its influence and effects to the polluted atmosphere and sterile region which surrounds that deadly tree. `It is not air, but the breath of hell, teeming with desolation and horror. Its soil produces nothing but noisome and poisonous weeds, and is covered with the bleached bones of its wretched victims. In the midst of this garden of death stands the fatal tree, guarded by the demon of destruction, whose touch deranges heaven's noblest plan, perverts life's genial fluid to corroding venom, and changes the healthful form to a putrid mass of corrupted mortality.' “Thus the pestilent Upas, the hydra of trees, “Its boughs o'er the wilderness spreads, “And with livid contagion polluting the breeze, “Its mildewing influence sheds; “The birds on the wing, and the flowers in their beds, “Are slain by its venomous breath, “That darkens the noon-day with death, “And pale ghosts of travellers wander around, “While their mouldering skeletons whiten the ground.”[8] [8] Montgomery's Poems, page 167. “Shun, as you hope to prosper, this fatal spot; let neither fame, wealth, nor rank, allure you within the sphere of its baneful influence; preserve your integrity and independence, and be charitable to all men. Thus will you experience a rich reward in the consciousness of deserving one. “In my last, I forgot to communicate an interesting fact. In returning from Boston, I travelled by the way of Worcester, Albany, and Buffalo; at the latter place, I embarked on board a schooner, and came to Cleveland by water. In passing through Auburn, a beautiful village on the Owasco lake, I fell in company with a gentleman, whose home is in the neighborhood of judge Brown, the amiable quaker who dined with us at Mulberry-grove (you may recollect) about two years ago. The judge, as his neighbor informed me, enjoyed good health, and, when he left the village, was in full uniform, on parade, at the head of his regiment! He is colonel of militia! A happy triumph of reason and patriotism over the prejudices of early education. Adieu.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. A CRITICAL MOMENT. “The Handkerchief:—the Handkerchief!” Shakepeare. At Cambridge George found himself moving in a new world, and his whole deportment became gradually changed as he adapted himself to the situation in which he was now placed. Like Godwin's Fleetwood, (and like almost every other student of similar habits and disposition) the savage of Cayahoga soon became metamorphosed into a classical buck; “as he could not escape the coxcombs of the University, he surrendered himself into their hands with the best grace he could, and selected one young person for a friend, who kindly undertook his introduction into the world.” But, like too many others, he was unfortunate in his choice, for beneath a specious exterior, this Thomas Sandford, his new friend, wore a corrupt heart. He was three years older than George, had lost his father at an early age, and was the ruined victim of maternal indulgence. The virtuous disposition, correct habits, and ingenuous manners of George, could not long escape the notice of his class-mates, and while he thereby gained the esteem of a few, he became the subject of derision with many. Among the latter was Sandford himself, though he concealed the sentiment under the mask of consummate hypocrisy. He considered all religion as a farce, and its votaries as mere actors in a drama, assuming a language and habit foreign to their real character. In compelling his friend to relinquish this garb, he thought he should confer on him a most essential benefit. But aware of the strength of early prejudices, he knew that great caution and circumspection were to be employed in the undertaking, but he also knew that if his efforts were crowned with success, his triumph would be worth the labor. To unmask the hypocrite, and then hold him up to the derision of his associates, was the object he contemplated, and to effect which he put in requisition all the little ingenuity of which he was master. For this purpose, he sought every opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance with his intended victim, and of ingratiating himself into his favor, until he could gain his entire confidence; he entered into his sentiments, flattered his taste, and counterfeited the friend and the moralist with so much success, that notwithstanding the caution of his father, the unsuspecting honesty of George was imposed upon; a stranger to deceit himself, he was too generous to suspect it in others. He felt grateful that a youth of young Sandford's accomplishments and correct deportment should thus court his intimacy, and felt it a duty to make every return in his power. He recollected the advice of his dear father, to associate with none but the good and the virtuous, and congratulated himself on his good fortune in the choice he had made. Almost every evening, during the winter, was passed in each other's society. Having thus succeeded, almost beyond his hopes, in deceiving, Sandford had no doubt of equal success in seducing. He began by occasionally expatiating on the pleasures of sense in the most glowing and exuberant language he could command, and took frequent opportunities of reading to him the poems of the voluptuous Moore, and others who like him have prostituted their talents in giving to the haggard looks of vice the most exquisite coloring and captivating softness. All this, however, produced no other effect on George than that of drawing from him his most solemn protest against the immoral tendency of such productions, and some demonstrations of surprise at the taste of his friend. The mother of Sandford resided in Boston, and our hero consented to accompany him thither on one of his weekly visits. It was in the twilight of a moonless evening in May, when they crossed the bridge, and quite dark before they reached their place of destination. A servant received them at the door, and showed them into an elegant parlour where a middle-aged lady was sitting, who rose to receive them; and welcomed her dear Thomas with many demonstrations of pleasure. George was introduced by his friend, who then left the room, and in a few minutes returned with two beautiful girls, his sisters. Our hero now found himself very agreeably situated, and wondered within himself why all the female world were not so civil, polite, and condescending as the trio with whom he was now conversing, and he more than once complimented Mrs. Sandford on the blessings she possessed in two such daughters. The sweetest smiles and kindest words were the answers he received to every observation he made. “Excepting Catharine, (thought he) Amelia, and Ellen, I have never before seen such agreeable girls, and Mrs Sandford is certainly the most amiable of women—my aunt Cushing excepted.” In a short time supper was introduced and invitingly served up, when, by the kind interference of his friend, George found himself seated at table by the side of Maria, one of these pretty sisters. The social glass went round, the conversation became lively, and the polite attentions of his fair entertainers unremitting. As soon as their repast was finished, Sandford ordered more wine for himself and his friend, while he requested Maria to favor them with a few airs on the Piano Forte. George earnestly seconded the request, led her to the instrument, and listened to a sweeter voice than he had ever heard, except Catharine's. The subject was love, and the beautiful Maria did it ample justice. George stood by her side, and every tone reached his soul. The fair performer would occasionally accompany some exquisite cadence with a glance of tenderness from her soft blue eyes, that made his every pulse throb with an extatic sensation he had never before experienced. He forgot himself, his friends, and the world—forgot what he had drank, and accepted a bumper from the attentive Sandford whenever offered. Wine, music, and beauty, all combined to charm his senses into a delightful trance—he was absorbed in a sweet delirium, and knew not, cared not, when or how it would terminate. Maria rose from the instrument, and in stepping forward her foot caught in the carpet; she must certainly have fallen, but for the fortunate position of the bewildered George, who received her in his arms. Her cheek was prest to his, and her lovely breast throbbed against his wildly palpitating bosom. Her long hair fell from the comb that had sustained it, and in flowing luxuriance enveloped them both in a kind of vail. His hand was in hers, she unconsciously prest it, and they sunk on an adjacent sopha with their burning lips glued to each other's. The mother, sister, and Sandford, had disappeared. George Washington Willoughby was in the arms of a prostitute! And must the fair fabric of virtue, so industriously erected by the best of parents, be in one fatal moment destroyed? No. Though reason slumbered, his guardian angel was awake, and by what casuists would falsely call accident, directed his eye to the floor, where lay the handkerchief of Catharine Fleming, with the fortunate G staring him full in the face. With something like a shrick he sprang from the guilty embrace of the astonished syren, snatched the token of his Catharine from the floor, and dropping on his knees ejaculated with convulsive energy, “Almighty God. I thank thee!” Then seizing his hat, darted into the street, and left the town. There is no such thing as accident or chance; never was—never will be. Every occurrence in the world, however trifling or accidental it may appear, is brought to pass by some cause originating in the spiritual world. All contingencies or accidents, usually ascribed to chance or fortune, are of divine providence, which operates in such an invisible and incomprehensible manner, for the sole purpose of preserving man in a state of perfect liberty and freedom, so that he may either attribute them to Providence or to chance. If Providence always acted in a visible and comprehensible 10 manner, man would be compelled, from this sensible appearance, to acknowledge it. and yet he is such by nature, that in his life and conduct he would contradict it. This is the reason that miracles have so seldom wrought conviction on the human mind. Our not possessing discernment sufficient to trace the connexion of those minute links which unite the chain of more conspicuous events, is no argument against the existence of such connexion. One end of the chain is only visible to us, the other is in the spiritual world. It was a circumstance of no apparent consequence, scarcely worth recording, that an agitated female should take a few wrong stitches in a piece of cambric; and thereby produce a letter but little differing in form from the one she intended to mark; yet, trifling as it may appear, that little letter was the instrument of Providence in saving her dearest friend from embarking on a sea of guilty pleasures, where none escape shipwreck, and few eternal destruction. It would perhaps be doing injustice to the reader's penetration to inform him that our hero had not been introduced at Mrs. Sandford's, but to one of those temples of pleasure which disgrace every populous town. This scheme of villany had been long hatching in the mind of Sandford, who was confident of its success. The weak indulgence of his mother supplied him with whatever money he wanted, and that was a sufficient passport to houses of this description, and removed every difficulty in the arrangement of this deep-laid plan of seduction. His mother and sisters were personated by the most frail of their sex. who had previously studied the parts they were to perform, and the managers left the stage when they saw the catastrophe of the drama at hand. Sandford retired with his paramour chuckling at his success, and anticipating the triumph which awaited him. Maria was almost frantic with rage, on seeing her prey escape from the silken snare which had been so artfully woven. She had anticipated a rich harvest of gain from the artless “novice,” and could not brook her disappointment. So much confidence had she in her personal charms, that a doubt of success had never crossed her mind; what then must have been her mortification at seeing those charms rejected with such coldness and contempt, at the moment when she thought them triumphant. She cursed George for a fool, and pursued him to the door, but he had vanished. For the part she had acted, Sandford had promised a liberal reward, and this she resolved not to forfeit by an impolitic report, and therefore retired alone to her chamber. Sandford, who entered the parlour soon after, had no doubt but his friend had accompanied her, and at a late hour departed for his mother's, clated with a pleasure which devils alone might envy. George was not acquainted with this part of the town, but ran on, regardless of his course, without once venturing to look behind him. When he became a little more composed, he slackened his speed, and began to reflect on the incidents of the evening. Never before had he reflected on his conduct with pain, but now, the picture filled him with despair. Bewildered with the wine he had drank, he knew not precisely of what he had been guilty, but a general idea of impropriety pervaded his mind. “What have I done!” exclaimed he, smiting his forehead—“how have I acted! I was a guest in the family of my friend, who treated me like their own son, and how shamefully have I repaid their kindness and hospitality! how basely abused their confidence! To get intoxicated, and then attempt to corrupt the honor of an innocent artless girl, who confided in me as the friend of her brother! O my dear father! I am unworthy your love! Amelia—Catharine—it would break your hearts to know it. How can I look my injured friend in the face? he will read my meditated guilt and despise the wretch who could be tempted to abuse his confidence. How damning are the effects of drunkenness.” Absorbed in such reflections as these, he pursued his solitary way; a watchman directed him to Cambridge-street, he crossed the bridge, arrived at the College about midnight, and for the first time retired to bed unhappy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. AN EXPLANATION. Why should the sacred character of virtue Shine on a villain's countenance? Ye powers; Why fix'd you not a brand on Treason's front That we might know to avoid perfidious mortals. Den. Iphig. For several days our hero was thoughtful and dejected, avoided all society as far as was compatible with his situation, and above every thing dreaded a private interview with Sandford. The latter, who was now studying how to publish his imaginary triumph so as to produce the most sport in the College, saw the embarrassment of George, but imputed it to the wrong cause. He had given the abandoned Maria positive instructions to inform her lover of his real situation, before she suffered him to leave her arms. This he was prompted to do by a regard for the honor of his family, not doubting but the night of rapture he had procured for his friend, would effectually atone for the deception he had used. “George's present shyness was therefore extremely natural in a novice, one too who had ever been zealous in condemning the vice into which he had now been initiated; but it would speedily wear off as sinning became more familiar. He was perhaps ashamed that his weakness was known to his friend. It would all help to increase the sport he was preparing for the class, though his own agency was to appear entirely accidental.” Such was the reasoning of this youthful libertine, to confirm which he visited George in his room, and invited him to renew his visit; who declined the proposition with an earnestness that somewhat disconcerted the inviter. “My mother and sisters will always be glad to see you,” said Sandford, with a look and emphasis which he thought would be understood, but which the embarrassment of George prevented his observing. “I have no reason to doubt it, from my former reception.” “I hope you were agreeably entertained,” said Sandford, with an arch inquisitive look. “Too much so,” answered George, and he checked himself. “Nothing was lacking that could contribute to my happiness. But I cannot repeat the visit; because —” 10* “Come, come! my dear Willoughby,” interrupted his insinuating seducer—“forgive your Sandford an error (if you will call it such) which arose from his friendship alone. Heaven is my witness that I had nothing but your happiness in view, and you confess that you was happy. Let the end sanctify the means.” “I impute no blame whatever to you,” replied George; “I am confident that your motives were generous, and I know that my reception was kind. I repeat that I was happy—very happy. But every leisure moment in future will be devoted to my studies.” George was now convinced that his friend had either not noticed his particular attentions to Maria, or else had different notions of propriety from himself. This consideration afforded him some relief, but at the same time gave him considerable surprise. Had Sandford embraced Amelia Willoughby on a first interview, kissed her, fallen on a sofa with her in his arms, and profaned her pure bosom with a licentious hand, drunk or sober, George would have knocked him down. But Sandford had left the room-and so had the rest! How came they to leave the room? Was not the conduct of Maria very different from what he would have approved in his sister under similar circumstances? Had she not made some undue and improper advances? That could not be true, or her worthy mother must have observed it, and would most certainly have reproved her. He had heard them spoken of as a very respectable family. But why had not his rude and abrupt departure drawn some inquiries from his friend? All was doubt and uncertainty; the whole scene was but imperfectly remembered, and George was bewildered in a labyrinth of conjecture. He was awakened from this reverie by Sandford's renewing his request; which he did in language that filled George with the most unfeigned astonishment: “What, my dear friend, can be your objections? You have passed the Rubicon you so much dreaded, and still exist in health and safety. Or to use one of your bible figures, you have tasted the forbidden fruit, and are yet alive to confess its sweetness and the happiness it yielded. Why not now eat your fill? If tasting incurs the penalty, cating cannot increase it. Away then with these shackles of priest-craft, and let us be happy in the way which God intended.” George had never recoiled from a rattle-snake, in the wilds of Ohio, with such an instinctive abhorrence as he now shrunk from Sandford, for he could only understand him as inviting the dishonor of his own sister, whose lips he thought were meant by the forbidden fruit he had tasted. He was for a moment struck dumb with amazement, and then exclaimed— “Couple not the name of Deity with so impious a sentiment! O Sandford! how have I been deceived in you! Surely, surely, such cannot be your serious opinion. You jest with your friend!” “Indeed I do not,” replied Sandford, “these are my real sentiments, and I am greatly deceived if you do not shortly adopt them yourself.” “Never! never!” exclaimed George with increasing earnestness, “I must first be lost indeed. Think what a scene of wickedness and misery would be produced by their general adoption; this fair world would become a theatre of the wildest confusion and disorder. Where could you imbibe such pernicious maxims?” “Call them not pernicious,” said Sandford, “when their end is delight. Is there not interwoven, with our very existence, an aversion to pain, and a love of pleasure? Why then should we act in opposition to these propensities? Is not their very existence a sufficient proof that we should obey their dictates? A contrary opinion is derogatory to that Being who implanted them in our breasts, unless you consider him as a tyrant, delighting in the pain of his creatures.” “Your premises are false,” cried George, and therefore all the arguments that can be raised upon them must fall to the ground. Our passions never came from God.” “To what other source can they owe their existence?” asked Sandford. “All things proceed from God, and by him alone they are and they were created. Pray explain yourself.” “With the Holy Scriptures for my guide,” replied George, “I will undertake it. Man was originally created in the image and likeness of his Maker, who blest him, and pronounced him good. His mind was then a paradisical garden, planted by Omnipotence himself, and abounding with the most delectable fruits of love and wisdom, continually refreshed by a never-ceasing stream of life and mercy. The divine fountain of good, whence all his happiness flowed, was the supreme object of his love, and his neighbor was regarded as his second self. “But, being endowed with a free volition, he possessed the power of transferring this love to inferior objects, and, in process of time, the unhappy transfer was gradually effected. From adoring the fountain, he began to contemplate the stream, till forgetting its source, he madly imagined it originated in himself. Self-love succeeded, and, like a wily serpent, seduced his affections, corrupted his judgment, and insinuated the forbidden idea of self-sufficiency. This was that accursed fruit which he had been prohibited from tasting. `Eat,' said the serpent, `and imagine thyself a god.' Man ate, and knew his Creator no more. “The dreadful consequence was a total perversion of all the good he had received. Conjugal love degenerated into lust; self-preservation was debased to self-love, and self-love reduced to selfishness; innocent enjoyments became guilty intemperance, prudence was perverted to suspicion, and economy to covetousness; manly firmness sunk to wilful obstinacy; generous emulation descended to envy, and envy produced wrath, malice, hatred, revenge, and murder. In short, the love of good which had been implanted by Heaven in his soul, was adulterated, perverted, and transformed into the love of evil. Every affection that had been given to promote his happiness, was changed by himself into a lawless passion, productive of the keenest misery. Thus our passions were never bestowed by God, but are the perversion of good affections, which were given to make us happy. `Evil, be thou my good,' said man, and evil became his life. “Such was the fall of man; and the love of evil, thus acquired, has descended from father to son, in regular succession, while each generation has increased its magnitude and malignity by inventions of their own—except where its hereditary course has been arrested by the work of regeneration. To increase man's ability for the performance of this work, to instruct him in its nature, and to assist him in the process, was the object of our Saviour's mission on earth. “Away, then, with that contemptible sophistry which would persuade us that our passions were implanted in us by God, and that we must consent to remain their passive vassals, instead of striving to control and govern them.” Sandford smiled rather contemptuously at the gravity and earnestness with which George delivered this harangue, and then replied: “You were undoubtedly designed for the pulpit, Wilioughby, and I hope to live to see you ordained. But your sophistry beats mine all hollow. Pray tell me what you mean by the love of evil descending from father to son? I'll bet two to one that there is not a clergyman in the state who ever dreamt of so curious an idea, and I feel an irresistible desire to hear it explained. Gratify me, if you please.” “I will endeavor to make myself understood,” replied George, with his usual good nature. “In the present degenerate state of our natures, we are more prone to evil than to good; this is a truth which no one can deny who believes the Scriptures. These bad propensities can only be conquered and destroyed by a continued struggle against them, and some are wise enough to engage in this mental warfare, with sufficient zeal and sincerity to effect that desirable object; for, whenever this contention with our internal enemies is resolutely persisted in, Heaven always crowns our humble efforts with complete success. I mean, if we apply to Heaven for assistance— but never without. This is what I call regeneration. “If these propensities to evil are thus effectually eradicated from the minds of a young connubial pair, previous to their union, their happy offspring will be much less susceptible of similar temptations. For as the soul of every child is as much the offspring of the parent's soul, as its body is of the parent's body, all dispositions, inherent in the soul, must descend from the parent to the offspring. It is this hereditary evil, thus descending, and continually accumulating, that has made this world what it now is, a scene of wars, hatred, cruelties, thefts, murders, and every other crime. “Were not these hereditary propensities to evil, now and then arrested in their descent, by the reformation and regeneration of the few who are wise enough to see the necessity of such a change, the whole human race would, ere this, have been destroyed by the monstrous accumulation. “Thus, sir, have I, briefly as possible, endeavored to comply with your request. The sentiments I have exprest, were inculcated by the best of parents, who has nothing but my welfare in view, and who has never yet put a restraint on a single inclination of my heart, that was compatible with its future peace.” Sandford here broke out into a broad laugh, and George requested to be made acquainted with the cause of his unreasonable mirth. “That the son of such a parent, endowed with such strict precepts of piety, and professing such elevated sentiments of virtue, should pass a night in a brothel! Ha! ha! ha! A clear perception of the whole truth, now, for the first time, flashed like lightning on the mind of George. Had he obeyed the first impulse that followed this conviction, the serpent had been dashed from a third-story window into the College yard; our hero's personal prowess would have found no difficulty in the undertaking; but he had been taught to examine every doubtful impulse by the light of the understanding, and one moment restored his calmness. “Mr. Sandford,” said he with great solemnity, “the only punishment that I shall condescend to inflict on you for your diabolical treachery, is, that of depriving you of an imaginary triumph. I did not remain in the place to which your fiend-like artifice had conducted me, two minutes after you left the room, but escaped as innocent as I entered it. Of this you may be convinced by enquiring. So, sir, the triumph is mine, and is the effect of those paternal precepts which you have the hardihood to ridicule.” Sandford was thunderstruck at this intelligence; but assumed composure enough to ask in a tone of low irony— “And pray, parson Willoughby, what other good precept has this dear parent taught you?” “One more, which I shall immediately put in practice,” answered George, with offended dignity, “and that is, to hold no parley with the devil after I have once discovered his cloven-foot.” So saying, he opened the door of his room, and added, in a tone quite new to his guest, “Avaunt! thou imp of darkness! and never again dare profane this room with thy hateful presence, nor pollute my atmosphere with thy contaminated breath. Start!” “In my own time, sir!” answered Sandford, as he assumed a menacing attitude, and in the next moment he lay prostrate in the hall, with his senses bewildered by the sudden transition. George closed his door, while the fallen hero thought it most prudent to slink to his own room, and there plan some scheme of vengeance, in the execution of which, his own personal safety would not be jeopardized. But, before that scheme could be brought to maturity, he was obliged to withdraw from the University, to avoid being publicly expelled, with two others, for a riot in which they had been engaged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. FEMALE SMALL TALK. “Trifles, light as air.” Shakspeare. A few days after the foregoing event, a package of letters arrived from Mulberry-grove, directed to Mr. Cushing, among which was one for Amelia, from her friend Catharine, and another from major Willoughby to his son, who had just arrived in town, to spend the spring vacation, which lasted two weeks from the fifteenth day of May. Catharine's epistle was couched in affectionate terms, and bespoke the sincerest friendship, in a style peculiarly chaste and correct. Towards the conclusion, she gave a description of several new neighbors that had settled around them, noticed many public improvements, mentioned that their new house was completed and 11 furnished, and concluded with lamenting the absence of her friend Amelia, and expressing many wishes for her speedy return. George listened in the most anxious suspense, while his sister was reading this letter, and heard the usual conclusion without the least reference to himself. “Is that all?” exclaimed he, as Amelia was folding the paper. “Why, is not that long enough for a female?” said his sister, with a smile; “what more could you possibly contrive for her to say?” “O, nothing, answered her brother, with a sigh, and walked whistling to the window. “Aye! here is a postscript,” said Amelia, and George was at her elbow in an instant—“but I confess that I cannot understand it. Perhaps you possess some key to unlock its meaning.” George snatched the letter from her hand, and read— “When you see your brother, tell him that his harp is safe, and still tuned to the key of G, as he left it. My grandfather assures me that I have made considerable proficiency in learning to play: the only air, however, which I can execute tolerably, is `Yes or No.' Inform him, also, if you please, that my bird has never yet returned, as he assured me it would, although I frequently dream that I have him in my bosom. Young Logan was here about a month since, and appeared quite dejected at the loss of his friend and preserver. He told your father that George would forget all he had taught him, which he considers of much more real importance than all his book-learning. So you must caution your brother to forget nothing that he has once learnt, and least of all, the letters of his gamut.” George did possess a key to unlock its meaning —it was the key of “G transposed from C,” and it vibrated in unison with the tenderest fibre of his heart; he unconsciously prest the paper to his lips, and his sister smiled. “Are you giving or receiving, my Adonis of the woods?” exclaimed his cousin Ellen. George did not understand her, and she put into his hands the New-York Columbian, where he read the following: GIVING AND RECEIVING. The suppliant departed, while gratitude's tear In his joy-beaming eye was suspended; My heart bounded light, for my Mary was near, Who thus the donation commended: “The bosom which softens at Misery's wound, “And proffers the balsam to heal him, “With the glow of contentment must joyfully bound— “And such is the breast of my Selim.” “But which,” I exclaimed, as the fair one I prest, While her eye with affection was brightened. “Receiver or donor, which think you most blest? “Whose joy by the action most heightened?” “The being, she answered, you saved from despair, “Who tastes, by the sudden reversion, “Of exquisite bliss a proportionate share “To the depth of his recent immersion.” Her answer was sweetened with love's nectared kiss, And my breast with the transport was heaving. As I owned, with a sigh, that though giving was bliss, It was faint to the joy of receiving. “And do you think, George, that a kiss would adhere to that paper during a journey of six hundred miles?” asked Amelia; “If, however, there was one deposited in that letter, it must of course be my property, and I insist upon your restoring it instantly. There—that's a good boy. But wont your cousin Ellen be jealous?” George called her a mad-cap, and saluted his cousin. “There are other young ladies in the room,” observed Ellen. “But I dare not presume”—said George, hesitating and blushing. “Dare not presume to treat the ladies with neglect,” cried Ellen, “and bestow no partial favours in this company.” The young ladies tittered, and George felt an additional glow in his face. “O the dear little lump of modesty!” exclaimed the ever gay Ellen. “Why, George, you must come oftener to this polite metronolis, and teach us the art of blushing. The ladies will be infinitely obliged to you, as it will save a world of cosmetics.” “I fear I should lose the art myself, by attempting to teach it,” replied George, a little reassured. “But why does my cousin wish to revive so antiquated a fashion?” “Merely to keep you back-woods-men in countenance. But do tell me if there can be any roses in that dismal part of the world since you and Amelia left it; for it is my opinion that you two have robbed madam Nature of all her carnation—in that part of her territory at least.” “Our complexions are the result of a healthy climate and pure atmosphere,” answered George; “but the ladies of Boston would there be taken for spectres.” “O the brute!— “Of a super-angelic order, cousin, of course.” “But we have strangely deserted the subject,” cried Ellen, rising, and leading her cousin forward to the two visiting ladies. “There, sir, I command you, in the name of gallantry, beauty, and love, to treat all this good company alike; and now disobey me on your peril!” “But will it not be rude?” asked George, with an earnestness that made them all laugh. “Very rude,” replied his sister, “to neglect it. Ellen, you will have to polish the young savage.” “It was a bliss to which I thought it presumption to aspire,” said he, as his lips met those of the fair strangers. “Born for our use, you live but to oblige us,” exclaimed Ellen. The young ladies, whom George had been thus compelled to salute, were the daughters of judge Palmer, a gentleman of no inconsiderable notoriety as a lawyer and politician. The eldest, whose name was Harriet, was about eighteen years old, not remarkably handsome, but famed for her filial affection and domestic virtues. Sophia, her sister, was three years younger, a pert little miss, of considerable beauty, and very vain. I have been thus particular in introducing them to the reader, because he will meet them again, if he has patience to prosecute the journey of this history a few stages more. If not, he must be content to drop their acquaintance here, and bid them an eternal adieu. “And now,” cried Amelia, “you are not aware of the favor you have conferred on me. I knew not what in the world to fill my paper with, in answering Catharine's letter, and you have furnished me with a subject.” “In what manner?” asked he. 11* “Why, I can now tell her, in the first place, that I have seen my brother, and told him what she desired; and, in the next place, that he is in a very high key, (say G in alt.) and in the third place, that he studies very hard—to please the ladies; and fourthly and lastly, that he kisses them all at the first interview. Is not there a subject for a letter?” “Amelia! you will not write any such thing,” said George, in a tone of alarm that much diverted the ladies. “Wont I? You see then!” “Make me your friend,” cried Ellen, “and I will furnish you with a talisman, that will exact the most implicit obedience from your sister.” “What can that be?” “This—only look,” and she began counting her fingers—M,O,R,S,E.” Amelia was visibly embarrassed, and blushed very deeply. “See! see!” exclaimed Ellen—“behold its wonderful effects! Whenever that girl threatens you again, you have nothing to do but what I have just shown you, and mum is the word, she is dumb directly.” “How you run on, cousin Ellen,” cried Amelia; “my brother will think you crazy.” George knew not what to think, and was just going to request an explanation, as the door opened, and a gentleman entered with the air and ease of an old acquaintance. “You know the old proverb,” exclaimed Ellen. “There are so many old proverbs,” replied the gentleman, “that I may not be fortunate enough to hit upon the one to which the facetious Ellen alludes.” “Well, I shall not assist you,” said she, “only we were just speaking of you as you made your appearance. Mr. Willoughby, give me leave to introduce, to your most particular acquaintance, Mr. Morse—not the geography maker. Mr. Morse, this is Mr. George Washington Willoughby, the only son of major Edward Willoughby, and brother to Miss Amelia C. Willoughby, heir apparent to all his father's estate, real and personal, together with the sword of Washington. Nay, do not be alarmed, sir, he will only inherit half the said estate, having generously agreed to transfer the other half to his dearly beloved sister, the aforesaid Amelia C. Willoughby, on the day of her espousals with Mr. Somebody, which event, we understand, is to take place some time in the month of December next, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eleven.” “O you inconscionable babbler!” exclaimed Morse, “I wish that my new friend here would find a curb for that tongue.” “It must not be a matrimonial curb, I assure you,” replied Ellen; “I could talk a husband to death every fortnight. Besides, that fellow is a savage, just out of the wilderness, where he left a beautiful unfinished work, entitled, the `Wild Irish Girl,' which he knows all by heart; besides several modern songs, among which is that of `Kate of Colerain.' And even his dearly beloved sister, the aforesaid Miss Amelia C. Willoughby, is so much of a savage, that she is always talking about one Logan, and it would not surprise me, in the course of two or three years, to see a couple of papooses on her back, unless some civilized christian will condescend to take her himself.” “Peace! my dear cousin, if you love me,” cried Amelia, “and do not compel me to leave the room.” “Not for the world, Amelia, and if you threaten it again—Cousin George, exhibit the talisman I gave you.” “Excuse me Ellen, a generous conqueror will never refuse quarter when it is called for.” “Well, I am sure that no one can impeach my generosity. When you begged so hard to salute these ladies, sir, did I not at length give you leave, though will extreme reluctance? “You will allow me the same liberty, I hope, Miss Ellen?” said Morse. “No, hang me if I do,” replied she, because your request springs from interested motives.” Tea was here introduced, and this trifling suspended; but George had heard enough to interest his curiosity; he, therefore, after tea, retired with his aunt, and received the following information: Mr. Morse was a young man of respectable connexions, and the proprietor of a very lucrative manufacturing establishment; an intimate acquaintance, and great favorite of the family, and, for the last two months, since his return from Europe, the professed admirer of Amelia, at whose request Mr. Cushing had written to her father on the subject of his proposals. Major Willoughby's answer had just been received, and was to this effect: “that the inclinations of his children, in a matter of so much importance to their happiness, should never be arbitrarily controlled, nor in any manner influenced except by friendly advice; that he had perfect confidence in the prudence of his daughter, and in the wisdom and friendship of her present protectors; was well satisfied with their recommendation of the lover, and concluded with a promise of attending the celebration of the nuptials, if they should be deferred until the month of December following.” George felt perfectly satisfied with this arrangement, and returned to the parlor with his aunt. The Miss Palmers had departed, and the subject was now discussed, without restraint, by this happy little family party, the whole of whom expressed their pleasure for the promised attendance of the major at the felicitous event. The transported lover was impatient to pay his duty to so kind a parent. “I can easily perceive,” cried Ellen, “which will prove the most affectionate and dutiful son, the christian or the savage. There is my cousin George who has trifled away two hours here, with a letter from his father in his pocket, and the seal is not broken, and yet he is so fond of reading letters, that he snatches other people's out of their hands, and kisses the postscript.” The accusation was just. In attending to his sister's letter, he had entirely forgotten his own, and unconsciously deposited it in his pocket-book. He now obtained leave, and perused it without delay, after which, at the request of the family, he read it aloud. The subject was his sister's projected marriage, and his father's intended visit, with this addition—“Such an arrangement, my son, may save you the fatigue and expense of a journey to this place, and the loss of much useful time, which, I think, you can feel no inclination to incur, but for the pleasure of meeting your father, and the delay of a few months will heighten that pleasure to both of us. Should you obtain leave to make this journey, it would occupy at least three months. I would recommend, therefore, that you pass the autumn vacation at your uncle Cushing's in Boston, and return to College as soon as it expires.” “And now,” cried Ellen, “I have some hopes of you; for, if we can keep you from the forest another year, I think you will make some progress in civilization, that is, if you will leave your books at Cambridge. My papa shall purchase a harp, and you shall teach me to play, and I will sing yes or no, just as you direct me, and you shall call me Kate, and I will answer `arrah! now, my dear honey!' and we will be as happy as the day is long. Now, wont you, my dear cousin?” A recommendation from his father was the same as a command, to George. He was thinking of Catharine, and another year's absence, while his giddy cousin rattled on, unattended to; but, at the conclusion of her rhapsody, she patted him on the cheek, and compelled him to answer, “Born for your use, I live but to oblige you.” “Apropos!” exclaimed his cousin—“this evening, Cooper plays Zanga, for his own benefit, and it is his last appearance for the season.” The hint was understood, and the whole party adjourned to the theatre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. MORE NEW CHARACTERS. That which Alexander sigh'd for, That which Cæsar's soul possess'd, That which heroes, kings, have died for, Glory!—animates my breast. Montgomery. During the vacation, George resided at his uncle's as his father had proposed; but was no longer the solitaire that his volatile cousin represented him. He left his books at Cambridge, and cheerfully joined in every innocent scheme of pleasure and amusement that was proposed, while Ellen congratulated him on his progress towards a state of civilization, and gravely undertook to instruct him in the important mysteries of etiquette and the beau monde. He goodnaturedly humored her in all her directions, consented to take private lessons of Turner in the sublime science of dancing, and soon became expert at the small sword, under the tuition of Haussey. But notwithstanding the charming frivolity of Ellen Cushing, and her affected aversion to “books and bookworms,” she was herself a good English scholar, could read and speak the French language fluently, and spent considerable time in her library. In one part of her playful proposition to George, she was serious, and that was to become his pupil on the harp, for which purpose the instrument had been actually procured; but being already a proficient on the piano, and not possessing all that patient perseverance which is necessary to acquire a difficult art, she soon abandoned the design, returned to her piano, and relinquished the “outlandish instrument” to her tutor, who neither felt nor expressed any regret at the arrangement. With all Ellen's affected cheerfulness, however, she was not happy. Cupid had inflicted a deep and incurable wound in her bosom, which rankled there without hope, and without relief. I am here imparting to the reader a secret with which the dearest friend of Ellen was unacquainted. The object of her affection, was her father's chief clerk, William Orville, a young gentleman deservedly beloved by all who knew him. Brought up almost from infancy together, Ellen and William had ever felt the purest friendship for each other, which had gradually ripened into a more tender passion in the breast of the gentle fair one. William was a poor orphan boy, and jealously sensible of his dependent situation, set a strict guard over his affections as soon as he felt any symptoms of their aspiring to a mark which he thought so far beyond his reach. He was now twenty-three years of age, and had just returned from England, where he had been employed above two years as Cushing's commercial agent. When he and Ellen again met, more than ever he felt the necessity of watching his heart, for she now burst upon his dazzled view in a blaze of finished beauty, and he could have almost worshipped her as a deity. But his unassuming disposition dared not admit the idea to cross his mind, that Ellen was within his reach. “Such happiness is not for Orville,” he would sometimes exclaim; “the rich alone can reasonably hope to obtain such a prize. Were I to presume so far as to speak to her of love, her friendship, with which I am now blest, would be forfeited for ever. Down! down! presumptuous heart! be content with friendship, and look lower for love.” Poor Orville! Even while he was indulging such melancholy suggestions, Ellen was only restrained by that self-respect which so properly belongs to the sex, from throwing herself into his arms. “She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud, Prey on her damask cheek.” Indeed, rumor had whispered to her ear, that Orville was actually lavishing his attentions on Harriet Palmer, a young lady to whom the reader has already been introduced; but this, like many other tales of that loquacious deity, was entirely destitute of foundation, for Harriet's heart had long taken up its abode in the manly breast of Ellen's cousin Aylwin, and throbbed for him alone. This young gentleman commanded one of his uncle's ships in the London trade, and as he was daily expected home, it may not be improper to make the reader acquainted with him before he arrives. John Cushing Aylwin was the son of Thomas Aylwin, esq. and nephew of the Hon. William Cushing, one of the judges of the supreme court of the United States.[9] [9] See Analectic Magazine, vol. 3, page 54. His father, previous to the revolution, was a merchant in Boston, and, at the time of the siege of that town, retired to Quebec with his wife, to whom he had been then recently married. It was in this city, at the close 12 of the war, that young Aylwin was born. The first years of his boyhood displayed a generous spirit, a contempt of danger, and those ardent feelings, which, though not uncommon at that age, add much to worth, and generally characterized the subsequent stages of life. He received there the rudiments of his education, which, however, was not further extended than to the first principles of mathematics, an elementary knowledge of the Latin, and a perfect acquaintance with the French language. His father destined him to a naval life, and while yet a child, had him borne on the books of a frigate which captain Coffin, (afterwards Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin Greenly) then commanded. The intentions of his father were, however, not long after, frustrated by an occurence that young Aylwin witnessed in the streets of Quebec. The horror excited in his breast at seeing a lad whom he had known, torn from the bosom of his parents by a pressgang, caused an invincible disgust to the British naval service; he could never again be brought to think of entering it. His attachment, notwithstanding, to a sea life was not lessened; and he became urgent with his parents to send him to their relatives in New England, that he might enter the American service. While arrangements were making to carry his wishes into effect, he was suddenly left an orphan by the death of his parents, within the short space of two months of each other. This loss was in some degree alleviated by the kind attentions of a paternal uncle, who finding it impracticable to procure a suitable situation for his nephew in his favorite profession, endeavored to dissuade him from a life of danger, and turn his attention to mercantile pursuits. An effort was made to comply with the intreaties of his uncle, but it was ineffectual. He was then bound apprentice to a captain in the London trade upon most favorable terms; it being agreed that on their arrival in England, he should be permitted to remain at a naval academy for at least six months, and that he should be advanced to the grade of mate as soon as he acquired the requisite experience. As the captain had determined not to return to Quebec, he little regarded the stipulations into which he had so readily entered, and, on his arrival at London, put his vessel into the West-India trade. Two voyages were made by our youth, and such was the progress he made in his profession, that hardly had he passed his fifteenth year when he was made a mate in the ship. This pleasing dawn, (which in some degree compensated for the violation of the agreement) was soon overcast, for on the homeward voyage a dispute arose between him and his captain, which so enraged the latter, that on coming to anchor, he caused him to be kidnapped by a pressgang. He was immediately sent on board a receiving ship in the Thames, where he found himself surrounded by six or seven hundred individuals, the scourings of a vicious metropolis. All communication with friends was denied him; letters which he wrote were suppressed; hope itself was almost excluded from his breast. From this receptacle of wretchedness he was in a few weeks transferred to a gun brig. Here he was narrowly watched, and endured all the rigor exercised in the English service towards their impressed men, to induce them to enter as voluntary seamen. The great antipathy, however, which he had conceived for their service, would not permit him to subscribe to that which he considered would be his own infamy. Threats were unavailing; he had a mind that could not be subdued. After cruising in the north sea, the brig was ordered up the Miditerranean, and at the time of the invasion of Egypt by the French, was stationed on that coast. From thence the vessel was ordered to the East Indies; two years he passed on board of her in the Red Sea; and three more in different parts of the Indian Ocean. His constitution having become almost a sacrifice to the climate, he was there invalided, and permitted to return to his relatives and friends, by whom even his existence was unknown. In the course of the above service he was in several engagements, and distinguished himself particularly in one, by lashing to their brig the bowsprit of a French corvette, and then boarding. A warrant was offered him on the occasion, and promises were constantly held out to him of promotion, if he would but enter. These he always withstood, and though few indeed could he find among his messmates to commune with, yet he preferred his station of captain of the foretop to any office that could be bestowed on him in that service. While in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, almost his sole resource for amusement and instruction, was his bible. In identifying the positions of places distinguished in the sacred volume, and in tracing in the manners of the modern those of the ancient inhabitants of the surrounding countries, he would often forget the loss of his liberty and the evils of his situation. Although the inmate of the forecastle for more than six years, yet he remained untainted by the surrounding contagion. A short residence with his friends in Boston reestablished his health, and having become by adoption, what he almost considered himself by birth, a citizen of the United States, he immediately obtained from his uncle that employment in the merchant service which a thorough knowledge of seamanship entitled him to anticipate. Such was the noble youth for whom Harriet Palmer in secret sighed. The anniversary of Ellen's birth and her parent's marriage, both occurred on the sixth day of November, and had always been religiously observed by the family as a day of festivity and joy. The approaching celebration of these two events was to be more than usually brilliant, for Ellen was determined to treat her friends in the evening, to a masked ball! A fete of this kind was almost unknown on this side the Atlantic, and was a direct violation of one of the municipal regulations of the good citizens of Boston. But Ellen was so earnest in her request, and her parents so unwilling to refuse her any indulgence that would contribute to her happiness on this occasion, that they finally consented, on condition that the company should he select, few, and such as so romantic a design could be safely confided to; that no one should enter the ball-room without first unmasking to some one of the family who knew them; and that every one in coming and departing should wear over their dress a dark domino of a fashion not calculated to attract the attention and curiosity of that inquisitive class of citizens who too often neglect their own concerns to pry into those of their neighbours. To all this Ellen readily agreed, and the proper instructions were added to every card. 12* Among the numerous visitants who frequented this hospitable mansion, was general Dearborn, a veteran of the revolution, and a friend of major Willoughby. He was now collector of customs for the port of Boston, having recently resigned the arduous duties of secretary of war. This gallant officer discovered in George Willoughby all that noble enthusiasm and genuine honor, which had so eminently distinguished his father and secured him the friendship of Washington. He took every occasion of inflaming his youthful ardor by recounting the events attending his own campaigns, and particularly the desperate but unsuccessful attack on Quebec, in which he was engaged with Montgomery, Arnold, and Morgan, and their little band of veterans. Dearborn was attached to the corps under Arnold, who was wounded early in the action and carried from the field. Morgan succeeded to the command, and “with a voice louder than the tempest” animated the troops as they stormed the first barrier, and entered the town. Montgomery had already bled on immortal ground, and his division being repulsed, the corps under Morgan was exposed to a sanguinary but unavailing contest. From the windows of the store-houses, each a castle, and from the tops of the parapets, a destructive fire was poured upon the assailants. In vain was the second barrier gained by scaling ladders; double ranks of soldiers presented a forest of bayonets below, and threatened inevitable destruction to any one who should leap from the walls. Dearborn maintained for a long time this desperate warfare, until at last he and the remnant of his company, overpowered by a sortie of two hundred men with field pieces who attacked him in front and rear in a short street, were compelled to surrender. He was now put into rigid confinement, with a number of other officers, who were not allowed to converse with each other, unless in the presence of the officer of the guard. While in prison he was urgently solicited by the English officers to join the British: was promised a colonel's commission if he would accept it, and was assured, if he refused, that he would be sent out to England in the spring and inevitably hanged as a rebel. The only reply he made to their solicitations or menaces was, that he had taken up arms in defence of the liberties and rights of his country; that he never would disgrace himself nor dishonor his profession by receiving any appointment under Great Britain, but was ready to meet death in any shape rather than relinquish the glorious cause he had espoused. He was paroled in the following May. In the hard-fought battle which decided the fate of Burgoyne's army, Dearborn was ordered to pass the enemy's right wing, and take possession of eight heavy cannon which played over the British into the American lines. In executing this order, he was charged by a corps of light infantry, which he repulsed with fixed bayonets, gained the eminence, took the cannon and corps of artillery attached to them, and having disposed of them, made a rapid movement into the rear of the British lines, and gave a full fire before his approach was discovered. The British were soon after forced into a precipitate retreat, and Dearborn assisted in storming their works through the whole extent, under a tremendous fire of grape and musketry.[10] [10] See Niles' Register, vol. ii, page 178. To a recital of these events, George would listen with an attention as greedy as that of Desdemona while her gallant lover recounted his perilous deeds and hair-breadth escapes. George could never hear of wars, but — “much he wish'd To follow to the field some warlike chief.” In dreaming of future glory, playing on his harp, writing poetry, and playing with the small-sword, his hours flitted rapidly away, until the termination of the College recess recalled him to Cambridge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. AN AMERICAN MASQUERADE. Here beaux esprits in various figures lurk, Of Jew and Gentile, Bramin, Tartar, Turk; Wonder, all shapes in this assembly finds, Hermits and demons, emperors and hinds; All that diversify life's crowded field, And all prolific fantasy can yield. Hayley. Ellen's birth-day, like every other day, arrived in due order of time, and completed her seventeenth year. Her father, as usual, gave a sumptuous dinner, to which a large circle of his friends were invited. A band of music performed during the repast, which was succeeded by songs, toasts, and sentiments. This part of the festival was in honor of eighteen years uninterrupted connubial felicity which the parents of Ellen had enjoyed, and was attended solely by married guests. The evening was devoted to the celebration of Ellen's birth. A suit of three spacious apartments, in the second story of the house, was prepared, and decorated under the immediate and sole direction of Ellen and Amelia; here their united efforts of taste and fancy had been exerted for more than a week, assisted by every novel that they could procure, which contained an account of a similar fete. The three rooms, thus appropriated, were metamophosed into as many gardens, abounding with evergreens and artificial flowers, which were so artfully interwoven and arranged, as entirely to conceal the walls and ceiling. Each door and window represented the entrance of a beautiful arbor, in the flowery arch of which was suspended a gilded cage, containing different species of American singing birds, surrounded with variegated lamps, sparkling with a thousand brilliant tints. In the centre of the middle apartment was erected an elegant temple, consisting of a dome supported by eighteen Corinthian pillars, dedicated to Liberty, with a full-size statue of the goddess, standing on a pedestal, supporting the constitution with one hand, and the liberty-cap on a spear with the other. Around the gilded dome of this beautiful edifice was the music gallery. A vine of laurel, mingled with roses, crept up each column, and the American eagle was suspended from the centre of the dome over the head of the statue. On the inside of each pillar hung a shield, bearing the arms of the state it represented; and between them descended a green curtain, from the gallery to the floor, which, when dropped, concealed every thing within the temple. The adjacent apartments, on the right and left, contained each a spacious recess, which was now transformed into a beautiful pavilion, ornamented with lattice-work and flowers, and illuminated with variegated lamps. In the centre was a table, liberally furnished with fruits and other refreshments for the ladies, and surrounded with sofas for their accommodation. Two of the corresponding apartments in the third story were thrown into one, (by means of a sliding partition) for the supper-room, where the tables were fancifully decorated, and loaded with every dainty of the season, while the sideboards furnished ample supplies of American wine, from the vineyards of New-Switzerland, and every domestic beverage that could tempt the palate. Every appendage and ornament to this gala was American, though the fete itself was truly an exotic. Even the dresses of the guests were to be wholly composed of domestic fabrics, and fifty dominos, of the same materials, were prepared for those who should decline supporting characters. “O, you extravagant hussey!” exclaimed her father, as he took a survey of the apartments and their decorations, “a dozen such birth-days would make me a bankrupt.” “It is your wedding day, papa,” replied Ellen archly, at the same time kissing his hand; “and I feel it a duty as well as a pleasure to honor that event to the best of my abilities.” She was an only child, and her father smiled at her observation. At eight o'clock the company began to assemble, and were received in the front parlor, by Mr. and Mrs. Cushing, dressed in the plain costume of the New-England pilgrims, as they first landed at Plymouth. Here the guests assumed their masks, and those who were dressed for characters laid aside their dominos. They were then conducted up stairs, and ushered into an anti-chamber, adjoining the centre garden, where they were received by Ellen, habited as a shepherdess, with her crook fancifully ornamented with garlands, but without her mask. From this apartment a flight of stairs ascended to the supper-room, and directly opposite was the entrance to the ball-room. This entrance, from the anti-chamber, represented a general's marque, with the American standard on each side, united at the top, and here George Willoughby, dressed as a general officer, received the company from his cousin, and conducting them into his tent, permitted them to emerge into the full splendor of the illuminated gardens. Ellen and George could scarcely refrain from smiling at the ludicrous effect of their own arrangement, as the motley group passed under their review and inspection. There were gipseys, fortune-tellers, virgins of the sun, Venuses, Dianas, flower-girls, queens, and ballad-singers, among the ladies; and priests, sailors, knights, clowns, conjurers, pilgrims, soldiers, heathen gods, and christian devils, among the gentlemen; besides many dominos who supported no artificial character, and some of them perhaps possessed no real one. Many of the guests, particularly those of the dinner party, were in their usual dresses, and without masks, among whom was general Dearborn, and several members of the state legislature, who were assembled in a group near the temple of Liberty, to survey the happy performers in the mazy dance. While they were thus engaged, the curtains between the pillars were suddenly drawn up by an invisible hand, and hung in festoons beneath the gallery. A mask, in the Roman costume of Julius Cæsar, with the word “Ambition,” in letters of blood, on his forehead, then approached the temple, and after surveying for a moment the beautiful figure within, drew his sword, and made a desperate plunge at her breast; when, to the wonder and astonishment of all, the shield, (emblematical of the constitution) which her left hand supported, was instantly raised and parried the weapon. Three similar attempts were made with as little success, and Ambition reluctantly departed. While the spectators were expressing their admiration at the ingenuity of the machinery which must have effected this movement, and completed the happy allegory, another mask approached, in the character of Lovegold, old, decrepit, and meanly attired; on his wrinkled forehead was the word “Avarice,” written with charcoal. After tottering once or twice round the temple, stopping at each pillar to take a peep at the goddess, through a pair of leather spectacles, he paused exactly behind her, and raising a rough crab-tree cudgel, aimed a blow that must have felled the statue to the ground, had not his arm been arrested by “Patriotism,” in the costume of Cincinnatus. Several different assailants, by turns, were thus foiled in their attacks upon Liberty, some by the constitution, some by Patriotism, and others by both, in conjunction with Mars, who appeared in complete armor, and was well represented in the manly figure of Aylwin. This scene soon became so interesting, that it com manded the attention of all the company, and the dances were suspended. Eighteen little girls, dressed in white, trimmed with laurel, each holding a garland of roses in her hand, now entered the temple, surrounded the statue, united their wreaths, and performed a dance in honor of Liberty; the music playing a national air. Just as the dance terminated, a figure approached the temple, in the character of Ochrobond, in the Forty Thieves, armed with a short javelin in his right hand, and holding in his left a speckled snake, winding round his arm; his mask representing a countenance truly diabolical, so that many of the ladies screamed with affright; on his forehead was inscribed, in flame-colored characters, “Faction.” As he approached the temple, the eighteen sisters appeared terrified, but still remained united, and grasped more firmly the flowery links which connected them. Several times did the demon attempt to cut one of these wreaths, that he might enter the circle and approach nearer his intended victim; but was as often foiled in the attempt by the caution of the little girls. He then seized one of them by the arm, and attempted to tear her from the ring by force, but at that moment Patriotism repeated aloud—“Frown indignantly on the first dawning of an attempt to alienate any portion of this country from the rest, or enfeeble the sacred ties which now link its various parts.”[11] [11] Washington's Farewell Address. The demon started, relinquished his hold, and disappeared. In a few minutes, however, he returned, and with him all the discomfited enemies of Liberty, armed with bows and arrows, headed by Ambition, 13 who was supported on one hand by Britannia, and on the other by the genius of France. This motley group surrounded the temple and notched their arrows, but as the word was given to discharge, each of the sisters snatched her shield from the pillar, and opposed it to the assault, forming a complete circle of shields, each one bearing the arms of the state it protected. The arrows fell harmless at their feet, and before another discharge could be made, the assailants were put to flight by Patriotism and Mars, who attacked them sword in hand. The states replaced their shields, and renewed the dance for a few minutes, when the music ceased, and the goddess of Liberty thus addressed the admiring spectators: Vain the attempt, though men with fiends combine, To raze this Temple, or pollute the shrine; In vain each foe the threatening weapon wields, While Union guards me with a wall of shields; Till these firm pillars totter from their base, Columbia still is Freedom's dwelling-place. But, O, my sons! should yonder threatening cloud, Spread o'er this dome its dark portentous shroud; Should War's red tempest burst on Freedom's shore, And hostile cannon round our borders roar— Behold your leader! whose intrepid form [Dearborn. Shall be a bulwark to avert the storm; His glittering blade, which flash'd with Freedom's fire Where proud Quebec's embattled walls aspire, At Saratoga mock'd the lightning's flame, And carv'd his path to glory and to fame. Columbians yet, by such a chieftain led, Shall plant my standard where Montgomery bled. Having said this, she descended with graceful dignity from the pedestal, and advanced into the hall, with the eighteen sisters following in her train. “Who is she? Who can she be?” was now echoed from every mouth, and a crowd of worshippers soon surrounded the goddess, who, taking Patriotism by the arm, eluded the curious throng, and disappeared at a private door entirely concealed by foliage. It was Amelia and George who had thus disappeared. The dances were now resumed, when a beautiful la fille sauvage was seen peeping cautiously through one of the arbors, as if in search of some one that had eluded her pursuit. Her costume was strikingly characteristic, and the eyes of our idle party were soon rivetted upon her. She timidly advanced, still throwing her eyes around the garden, and starting, as if alarmed by some passing footstep. “Who are you, my pretty Indian princess?” enquired the general as she approached the party. “Pocahontas is my name.” “And whom do you seek?” After some modest hesitation, she replied— “Captain Smith.” “That's my name,” exclaimed a mask, just then approaching, in an elegant military uniform; “how can I be so happy as to serve you?” She looked up playfully in his face, and then shook her head. “Ah! you are not my Smith; he flies from Pocahontas, although she loves him, and once saved his life. But I will seek for him through all the forest. O, how this poor bosom throbs! it will be a cold pillow for him if he does not return to it soon.” “Hang him for an insensible dog! he'll never return,” replied the soldier; but here is a Smith that is ready to throw himself at your feet”—and he actually kneeled to the red princess. “No, no, no!” cried she; “you no Smith, you no soldier; you desert Miss Liberty. Now kneel again, and pray Pocahontas never tell.” Morse (for it was himself) was evidently embarrassed by this reply from the fascinating savage; not that her insinuation was correct, but because he found himself recognized by one whom he did not know. “Liberty or death, has hitherto been my motto,” cried he; “but I shall now take the liberty of changing it to Liberty or Pocahontas.” At this moment a young sailor, who had particularly regarded the fair savage from her first entrance, approached her with a respectful bow, and thus addressed her: “Pardon me, beautiful princess, for being the messenger of ill news, but duty compels me to speak—your Smith is no more! Go with me and I will show you his grave.” Pocahontas, who had started at his approach, was visibly agitated by this address. At length she exclaimed— “Dead! did you say? O, cruel white man, do not tell me so. Pocahontas will break her heart. Who slew him?” “No one, sweet Pocahontas; disease assailed him, and he bowed to the irresistible malady. But let us go and weep together over the grave of our common friend: “The full-orb'd moon will shed her silver rays To light our footsteps through the forest's maze.” “In character as a poet, Aylwin,” exclaimed Morse; “but a sailor ought to be better acquainted with lunar movements. The pale-faced goddess is not full-orb'd, but is now in her wane, and, conscious of her fading beauty, did not, this evening, presume to show her face until half past ten o'clock.” “I am neither an astronomer nor a conjurer,” replied the sailor; “and shall leave the calculation of Cynthia's precise shape, size, and altitude, to those whose brains are under her more immediate influence. For— “While this fair planet beams celestial light, Sun, moon, and stars are all eclipsed in night.” So saying, he bowed to Pocahontas, and taking her willing hand, led her away, while several voices exclaimed—“Happy Aylwin!” After eluding the eyes of curiosity, by winding among the shrubbery, he led her to a remote window-seat in the adjacent room, which, being surrounded by an arbor, entirely concealed them from observation. The gallant sailor was probably prompted by a spirit of adventure, and a curiosity to discover more of this interesting character. The motives of the fair one I shall not attempt to define. For more than a minute they gazed at each other without speaking; till the son of Neptune, beginning to feel embarrassed, took her affectionately by the hand, and enquired— “Did Pocahontas love Smith?” “You have read her history,” was the answer of the princess. Sailor. But when she thought him dead, she transferred her love to Rolfe. Let me be Rolfe, and be persuaded, lovely creature! that your Smith is dead. Pocahontas. And would you accept a transfer of the heart? That is a species of merchandise 13* of which every one wishes to be the original holder. Sailor. I will accept your heart on any terms. Name the conditions, and I swear to comply with them. Pocahontas. Quite in character as a sailor, but not as a merchant; do you often purchase “unsight, unseen?” Sailor. In this case I am willing to run the risk. With such a shape, air, voice, and hand, Heaven would never unite a bad heart, nor an indifferent face. Love has always been blind, and the risk is fair, because it is mutual. Pocahontas. No, Mr. Orville, I believe the advantage is on my side. Orville. Since you know me, fair princess— off, base vizard! But who, in the name of all that is fascinating, are you? Permit me to remove that envious mask which obstructs the rays of beauty. Pocahontas. Forbear, rash man! Can your eyes gaze at a meridian sun? Orville. I fear not, for they are already dazzled by those two twinkling stars. But every moment increases my admiration and impatience; every word you speak rivets a magic chain to my heart. O then, banish that sable cloud, and let the rosy morning burst upon my enraptured view. Pocahontas. Clouds depend upon the wind. Orville. Then my sighs shall increase to a gale; can it not be dissipated by the breath of love? Pocahontas. I had thought that no disguise could screen Harriet Palmer from the penetration of Mr. Orville. Orville. (In a tone of disappointment.) Is it possible! But your feigned voice completely deceived me. Well, Harriet, (replacing his mask) since it is you, this scene terminates, and exit Jack. Pocahontas. And why so, Mr. Orville, am I not worth a few pretty speeches? Orville. O yes; but it is trespassing on forbidden ground; besides, you know there would be no meaning in “pretty speeches” coming from me. Pocahontas. So, when you meet with an unsuspecting girl, who is not blest with that knowledge, you merely practise them for your own amusement. You should recollect, that though it be sport to you, it may be death to us. Orville. Nay, since you are serious, Harriet, I will explain. My heart is like an undutiful rebellious child. I must part with it to somebody, (and that very soon) to prevent its running away. Pocahontas. And why not let it run? Orville. Because I fear it would intrude itself among its betters, and get kicked out of doors in disgrace. I hoped to have found an asylum for it in the bosom of Pocahontas: Harriet Palmer, I know, has not one to give in exchange. Pocahontas. In plain English, Mr. Orville, you are in love with some one who does not return your affection. Is it not so? Orville. I should be over head and ears in such a scrape, if I dared. I will confess, Harriet, that there is a little spark here which I labor hard to keep smothered; but the gentlest breath of hope would blow it to a flame, that would either light me to happiness, or consume me to ashes. Pocahontas. (With a deep sigh.) Then there is no hope for—(she paused) for Pocahontas! Orville. What mean you, Harriet? Pocahontas. And who is this cruel fair one? Do I know her? Orville. You do—but she does not merit that epithet—she is the most gentle and generous of her sex. Fortune alone is cruel for placing her beyond my reach. She is rich, and I am poor. Pocahontas. Confide in me, Mr. Orville, and tell me her name. Orville. No, Harriet, not for the world! Should it ever reach her ear that I entertained a thought so presumptuous, I fear she would despise me, and I should be forever debarred the felicity of her society and friendship, which I now enjoy. The child of her father's bounty— But I am rambling. Pocahontas. (In extreme agitation.) Is it El— Ellen Cushing? Orville. Never let it escape your lips, Harriet, or I am ruined. It is Ellen Cushing.—Now say if there is room for hope? Pocahontas. Yes—for hope and happiness. Orville. How! Pocahontas. (Reclining her head on Orville's shoulder.) Ellen loves you. Orville. Do not sport with my feelings, Harriet; how can you be so cruel! Pocahontas. I do not sport—Ellen loves you; I have heard her repeat it a thousand times. Orville. Though you tell me what it would be madness to believe, Harriet, still repeat it; for, by Heaven, though I know it cannot be true, it is bliss to hear the sentence. Pocahontas. Ellen loves you. This was whispered so close, that the lips of Pocahontas touched Orville's cheek; her bosom heaved, and her whole frame was agitated. Orville, by an indescribable kind of instinct, caught her in his arms—her mask fell off—it was Ellen herself. At this critical moment they were alarmed by a universal shriek from the ladies, followed by a confused tumult, which compelled them to quit their retreat to learn the cause of the disturbance. As the reader may possibly possess a similar curiosity, I will endeavor to satisfy him in the next chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. A NEW CHARACTER. — He has, I know not what, Of greatness in his looks, and of high fate, That almost awes me. —Dryd.Mar.A-la-mode. My soul is wrapt in dreadful expectation, And listens to thee as if Fate were speaking. Den. Ap. Virg. As Orville and Pocahontas left the group at the temple, the attention of the company was attracted by a new character. This was a travelling minstrel, with his harp slung on his back— “Adorn'd with native elegance, he wore “In simplest form, the minstrel dress of yore.” He was instantly surrounded by the idlers of both sexes, offering him money to play; and after receiving several cents in his hat, he sat down on the steps of the temple to tune his harp. The band in the gallery had ceased, and the dancers began to assemble around the new comer. While he was tuning the instrument, few persons believed that he would attempt to play; but when he passed his fingers over the trembling chords, every eye glistened with surprise and pleasure. The tones were so sweet, and the melody so exquisite, that the auditors at length seemed almost entranced with wonder and delight. After running through a short, but very expressive symphony, he sung the following in a voice only surpassed in sweetness by the tones which accompanied it: THE MINSTREL. How happy is the Minstrel's lot, Whose song each care beguiles; The frowns of fortune fright him not, Nor does he court her smiles. Contented with his tuneful lyre, His art can yield the rest, He pours his soul along the wire, And rapture fires his breast. He envies not the power of kings, With all their glittering toys; The tones that warble from his strings, Impart sublimer joys. He builds a world of airy bliss, Where Love erects his throne; And though his fancy frame the kiss, Its sweets are all his own. What though no wealth his song repays, Nor laurels deck his lyre; The glow he catches from its lays, Is bliss supremely higher. What though his fairy pleasures seem Illusions shapeless toys— He would not lose so sweet a dream, For all your waking joys. As the last note of the concluding symphony expired, a mask, in the dress of a black friar, addressed the performer in a low voice, but in a tone so wonderfully singular, that George started with surprise. His stature was large, and his deportment dignified, but so completely was he enveloped in his sable cowl, that no feature, except a piercing black eye, could be discerned. Friar. Does it become the only son of Edward Willoughby, the destined champion of American Freedom, to waste his precious hours in idleness?—in worse than idleness—revelling in the lap of luxurious pleasure, and reposing on beds of roses—while his intrepid countrymen are braving the dangers of war, and snatching but a moment's rest on the cold ground, before the yell of battle arouses them to the work of death? How would that delicate hand, habituated to trill the wires of a harp—how would it handle the deadly rifle, or wield the sword of Washington? George. (Visibly embarrassed.) How—who are you? Friar. The friend of your father—the destined Mentor of his son. George. Where knew you my father? Friar. On the battle-field where he lost his hand. There he dedicated you to his country, and called on high Heaven to sanction the oath. A thousand times since has he ratified the contract, and I now claim its fulfilment. George. The son of Edward Willoughby will require no prompter when his country is in danger. But who commissioned you to prefer her claim? (He struck a few careless notes on his harp, and then asked with a smile) Who signed your credentials? Friar. Who announced your birth?—I am— At this moment the falling of a chandelier, in the adjacent room, called a universal shriek from all the ladies; which, mingled with the crash of broken glass, and the confusion of voices, created a momentary tumult, in which all were engaged, except George and the mysterious stranger, both of whom seemed too much interested in the conversation to relinquish it for so trifling an occurrence. George had now risen, and exclaimed in a tone of surprise— “Announced my birth!—Indeed you create a strange interest in my bosom. Speak—be more explicit. Who are you?” The stranger answered not, but throwing open his mantle, discovered a Miami warrior in the full dress of his tribe—an exact counterpart of the picture in major Willoughby's possession. George was lost for a moment in astonishment. George. Whoever you are, the costume of the character you have assumed is inimitably correct; and how you could thus have copied it without ever seeing the picture, I must confess I am at a loss to determine. Friar. I have nothing to do with pictures or copies. I am an original. You are my pupil, and the day fast approaches when the lessons I shall teach you must be put into practice in your country's defence. Even now the tomahawk is suspended; the ambush is laid; and before the rays of to-morrow's sun shall sparkle on the bosom of Erie, numerous white men will fall before the treachery of the foe. Your country calls! Obey her voice! for in the womb you were devoted to her service! So saying, he wrapped himself in his mantle, drew the cowl over his face, and, before George could reply, was lost among the crowd that surrounded the scene of confusion in the next room. A most tender scene between Orville and Ellen had been interrupted by the same disaster, and they were joined by our minstrel just as the signal was given for supper, when every mask was laid aside, and the whole party ascended to the banquet-hall. During the repast, Orville and Ellen were seated opposite each other, and their eyes spoke “unutterable things;” they literally banquetted on “lovers' food,” and scarcely honored with a moment's notice the delicious realities before them. Near Orville sat another who appeared also to have forgotten the purpose for which he came. This was George. The words of the Mysterious Chief still rung in his ears, and he examined every countenance at table, without discovering any feature that could have belonged to that singular character. No one knew what had become of the friar: neither his entrance nor his exit had been observed. Such a crowd of images obtruded on the mind of our hero, that he was entirely insensible to the scene of festive gaiety around him, and left the table having scarcely tasted a morsel. “Your country calls you—obey her voice, for in the womb you were devoted to her service.” What could this mean? America was at peace with all the world. He was lost in conjecture, and wandered alone through the lately crowded rooms in profound meditation. 14 “Shall I tell your fortune?” said a little gipsey to George, as he stood leaning against a pillar of the temple. He gave her his hand. Gipsey. What a beautiful hand! and how wonderfully marked with the chequers of fortune! George. And what do you discover there, my little prophetess? Gipsey. That you are beloved by a female whom you never suspected of affection, and who would cheerfully make a pilgrimage to Mecca, if by so doing she could acquire a right to this hand. George. Her name— Gipsey. I dare not tell. George. How then can I profit by your information? Gipsey. Will it give you no pleasure to know that you are beloved? George. Not unless I can love in return. Gipsey. And could you refuse your heart to an affectionate girl who doats on you? George. Suppose that I have no heart to refuse? Gipsey. Catharine will forget you—perhaps you will never see her again. George. Do you read that in my hand? Gipsey. We are interrupted—meet me at the east pavilion, there I will tell you more; and away she tripped, leaving George not a little surprized at her language and manner. At that moment his sister, with their cousin Aylwin, approached, and the latter exclaimed— “Beware of idolatry, George; here comes the deity of the temple.” George. Who is that gipsey, Amelia? Aylwin. Admirable! excellent! upon my honor. After abandoning the supper table, supper and all, with the glittering attractions around it, to enjoy a private tete a tete with a strolling gipsey, he gravely enquires, “who is she?” Don't you think that your brother is rapidly improving in refinement and gallantry? George. Do you know her, Amelia? Amelia. I am not at liberty to unmask any one of this company without their consent. The company now began to descend in crowds from the supper-room, and resume their masks, when a scene of “gay confusion” commenced. The exhilirating draughts of American wine had imparted a patriotic glow to almost every bosom, and good-humored wit and mirth now circulated without restraint. Characters and dominos who had scarcely ventured to breathe a syllable before supper, now found no difficulty in rattling out whole sentences, without regard to reason, rhyme, or syntax. Dull formality was entirely discarded, and that happy freedom tolerated which approaches to the very verge of decorum without overstepping the line. As soon as George could escape from his sister and cousin Aylwin, he resumed his mask, and strolled towards the east pavilion in search of his kind little gipsey; but as he entered the apartment a gold repeater in his pocket struck a quarter past four, and at that moment the Mysterious Chief stood again before him. Our hero started as if he had seen a spectre, while the object of his surprise exclaimed— “Relinquish the pursuit! and obey the voice of your country.” “What of my country?” inquired George, “when does she require my service?” “Now!—Hark! the war-whoop sounds!—the shriek of death echoes through the forest! and the vulture whets her beak for a bloody repast! The camp of the white man is surprised!—he bleeds!—he falls!—he rises!—and if he conquers—” “Maniac! What a singular taste for a masquerade character!” “Obey your country's call!—in the womb you was devoted to her service. I have reminded your father of his engagement. Remember me!” With this exclamation he again disappeared among the crowd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. AN AVOWAL. Love gives esteem, and then he gives desert, He either finds equality, or makes it; Like Death, he knows no difference in degrees, But planes and levels all. Dryd. Mar. A-la-mode. On the evening succeeding the foregoing fete, the light-hearted Ellen (whose artificial vivacity had given place to the genuine ebullitions of real felicity) sought a private interview with her affectionate mother, into whose maternal ear she poured her little tale of love. With her blushing face concealed in the bosom of a doating parent, she hesitated not in confiding to the same sanctuary the tenderest secrets of her heart. Not a thought nor a wish was disguised; she described the real state of her affections, and related the particulars of that interesting eclaircissement which took place at the masquerade. The result of this candid disclosure was, in the course of the following week, thus announced to the public, through the medium of Russell's Columbian Centinel: “Notice is hereby given, that William Orville has become a joint partner in the mercantile house of Nathan Cushing, and that the business of said house will, in future, be conducted under the firm of Gushing and Orville.” The tenth day of December was fixed for the celebration of the nuptials of Amelia, and all parties consented, that on the same day the fortunate Orville should lead his Ellen to the altar. Of a happier family perhaps that metropolis could not boast, until a slight tincture of gloom was thrown over it by a letter from Mulberry Grove, containing the unpleasant intelligence that Amelia's paternal aunt was severely indisposed, although her disorder was believed to be unattended with danger. This letter was addressed by the major to his son, who has generously permitted me to make from the original copy the following EXTRACT: “Every thing in the political world indicates an approaching war, and I am daily more and more impressed with a conviction of its speedy commencement. All nature seems to unite also in predicting some uncommon event, and I will venture to assert that the present year remains unparalleled in modern history for physical phenomena. “Comets, importing change to times and states, Brandish their crystal tresses in the sky.” One of those rare and erratic bodies, alike unusual for its magnitude and brilliancy, is still sweeping 14* through the southern hemisphere, which it illuminates with its “illimitable torch,” and for aught I know, —“From its fiery hair, Shakes pestilence and war.” An almost total eclipse of the sun has involved our country in darkness at noon-day.[12] [12] On the seventeenth day of September, 1811, the sun suffered an annular, amounting almost to a total eclipse. For the intensity of the summer's heat, the oldest remembrance “scarce can find a parallel.” In one place the earth has been parched with drought; in another deluged with torrents of rain; and unheard-of inundations have, in many parts, swept along with them, in promiscuous ruin, the works of nature, the monuments of art, and the products of the field. In many places pestilence, under a form entirely new, has prevailed to an alarming degree, prostrating whole families and settlements at once. The proud city of Charleston has been almost destroyed by a hurricane. Storms at sea and disastrous shipwrecks, have impoverished hundreds, and plunged thousands in mourning and lamentation; while earthquakes on land have caused our habitations to toter over our seemingly devoted heads. “I will not say that these things are certain prognostics of any greater human calamity, but I believe that they are the effects of that moral depravity from which alone all human calamities originate. “I will insist that there is more analogy between the moral and physical worlds than philosophers are willing to admit. I do not contend that comets produce wars and fightings, but I do believe that the evil passions and lusts from which wars and fightings are said to proceed, may sensibly affect the motion of matter; and even, perhaps, attract a comet from its regular orbit, to “gaze on the monster man.” “Recollect, this is merely my opinion. I would not wish you to imbibe any weak or superstitious ideas; but to view every thing in the light of reason, revelation, and philosophy. But never, I conjure you, lose sight of the close, real, and inseparable connexion which exists between spirit and matter, which is the same thing as between cause and effect. This will enable you to account for many phenomena that would otherwise remain inexplicable. Of the reality of such connexion I have abundant proof; and that wonderful sympathy which could prompt your mother's departing spirit to address her husband through the motionless lips of a lifeless corpse, has been displayed in numerous other instances, equally extraordinary. But when, from the prejudices of education and other causes, a man becomes determined to deny the existence of any connexion between the spiritual and natural worlds, the most stupendous miracle would produce no effect on his scepticism; he would not be convinced though one rose from the dead. He has adopted a different theory; and, right or wrong, he is determined to adhere to it. Whatever occurrence interferes with this theory, is deemed an illusion of the bodily senses. “I have little news to communicate. Emigration to this part of the country continues to be immense. I this morning received a letter from our neighbour Fleming, who is now on a tour of business in the state of Pennsylvania, accompanied by his daughter. It was dated at Robbstown, Westmoreland county, and contains the following paragraph: “In the course of the last four weeks, two hun “dred and thirty-six waggons and other wheeled “carriages passed through this place to the state “of Ohio, with families. Sixty persons accom “panied one waggon. About six hundred Me “rino sheep have also passed in the same direc “tion during that short period.” “If your aunt's indisposition assumes a favorable turn, (which the doctor says will be the case) I shall be in Boston by the middle of November, and there I hope to embrace a son-in-law. Adieu.” Although the countenance of Aylwin wore an incredulous smile, while his cousin George was reading the foregoing letter, to his uncle's family, he yet perfectly agreed with the writer in one assertion; that “every thing in the political world indicated an approaching war;” he had for some time considered that event inevitable. For several years he had sailed as master of a vessel, experiencing many of those vexations and losses from the respective belligerents to which American commerce had been exposed, and was convinced that the honor of the nation required a speedy settlement. Since his last return from Europe, he observed with pleasure that the political pulse beat in unison with his wishes on this subject. He had no doubt that the approaching session of congress would confirm his hopes, and that war would be declared before it again adjourned. “To continue therefore in the merchant service would be sharing the dangers without the honours of warfare: to privateering he would not willingly descend. The regular service appeared to him the only proper occupation for one who disliked inglorious ease—the field where his courage and nautical skill would find their reward.” With this impression Aylwin took an early opportunity of communicating his wishes to captain Hull, of the frigate Constitution, who invited him to take the station of sailing master on board of his ship, with an assurance that his exertions should not be wanting to procure him a lieutenancy as soon as practicable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. COINCIDENT AND CORROBORANT. —“Something still there lies In Heaven's dark volume which I read through mists! 'Tis great! prodigious! 'tis a dreadful birth Of wond'rous Fate! and now, just now disclosing, I see how terrible it dawns, And my soul sickens at it. Dryd. Oed. The middle of November arrived, without bringing major Willoughby to Boston. Day succeeded day, and still he came not. The whole month soon passed away without furnishing any intelligence from Mulberry Grove. The lovers grew uneasy, and all were fearful that the cause of this delay was melancholy, if not fatal. But on the first day of December their fears were reduced to a certainty by the following letter addressed to George. It was dated “Mulberry Grove, Ohio, Nov. 12, 1811. “My Son—I have strange things to tell you— events that will excite your “special wonder,” and which may almost cause you to doubt the veracity of your father. Attend, therefore, while I relate a series of facts as extraordinary as any that ever figured in romance, either ancient or modern. “In my last I mentioned the illness of your aunt—I then considered it trifling; but yesterday her mortal part was committed to its sister earth. “On Wednesday evening last, the sixth instant, she appeared to be considerably better, conversed cheerfully, and desired me to seek for some repose, as for the three preceding nights and days I had scarcely closed an eye. A little after eleven o'clock, she fell into a quiet sleep; when commending her to the care of the nurse, I composed myself in the old easy chair, wrapped in my great-coat, before a cheerful fire. It was some time, however, before sleep visited my eyes; my mind was occupied with far distant events, and the picture of the Mysterious Chief hung immediately in my view over the fire-place. The contemplation of this object insensibly led me into a train of reflections, with which you was necessarily connected, and in this frame of mind I fell asleep. “My waking ideas pursued me in my dreams; and wild forests, frightful precipices, treacherous ambuscades, and tented fields, floated in wild confusion before my bewildered fancy. At length, events appeared to occur in a more regular and connected series; the battle of Miami rapids was fought over again, with all its attendant particulars, and the oracular corpse lay stretched before me. “Suddenly, the scene was changed, and I found myself wandering alone on the shores of Erie; no habitation was visible, all seemed desolate, and I felt lost and bewildered. In the midst of my perplexity, I saw the figure of a man with a drawn sword in his hand, emerging from the wood with a slow and solemn step. It was the same form that I had left lifeless on the battle-field, but no wound nor blood was now visible. With a dignified step, he advanced to the place where I was standing, and with a smile of benignity tendered me his weapon; but in attempting to take it, my hand trembled, and the sword fell to the ground with a noise that awakened me. “I started from my chair, and found by the clock that I had slept more than two hours. I advanced softly to the bed, and found both patient and nurse in a sound sleep, and that of your aunt appeared so sweet and gentle that I forebore to awaken the nurse, and feeling considerably refreshed by my nap, determined to watch the remainder of the night myself. “I left the bed and walked to the window, where I amused myself awhile in gazing on the etherial expanse glowing with myriads of golden stars; the waning moon was riding “in cloudless majesty” over the eastern forests, and her silver rays glittered on the bosom of the frozen lake. “As I turned again towards the fire, my steps were impeded with something which, on examination, I found to be the sword of Washington. It had fallen, with its scabbard, from the hook by the window, and lay nearly unsheathed upon the floor. The noise produced by its falling must have been that which awakened me so suddenly from my dream; but why it should have fallen—(and at that particular moment too)—was a mystery I could not unravel. In my dream, the sword presented by the chief had fallen from my hand, either through carelessness or terror. What did that portend? The one I now replaced on the hook, had long been idle in its scabbard. Was it a reproof for remissness? That could not be, for my country had all that time been at peace. Did this weapon, —“Self unscabbarded, foreshow The footsteps of a secret foe?”* * Scott's Lady of the Lake. “While indulging such reflections, I again threw myself into the chair; and, without intending it, was instantly asleep. My former dream returned with all its particulars, and I was again awakened in exactly the same manner, for —“A clang Of angry steel that instant rang.”* With a kind of instinct I turned my eyes to the spot where I expected to see again the prostrate sword. I saw it not. The clock at that moment struck three. “I feel, my son, a reluctance to proceed; for you will immediately suspect that watching and anxiety have turned your poor father's brain. But, think of it as you will, I will leave nothing untold. The same figure that appeared in my dream, the exact counterpart of the picture on the wall, in the same dress, and with the same aspect, stood before me! “I was not in the least terrified, though the circumstance was such as would naturally produce that sensation. To have unexpectedly discovered an armed savage in my house at midnight, hovering round the couch of slumber, would, at any other time, have much alarmed me; but now I only felt surprised that a dream could thus be continued after I believed myself to be awake. I rubbed my eyes, and involuntarily exclaimed, “Is it possible!” still slowly advancing to the mysterious apparition, who smiled as I approached, with the same aspect of dignified benignity that I admired in my dream. “My sword was in his hand! but not undrawn. He gracefully presented me the hilt, with the same courteous smile and majestic attitude that graced the immortal hero who first tendered it to my acceptance. “Take it,” said he in accents that thrilled to my very soul; “take it, and redeem your vow.” “I had never forgotten the tones of that mysterious voice which announced your birth. I now heard them again. After staring a moment in astonishment, I exclaimed.—“Am I asleep or awake? This is, indeed, a most singular dream!” “The mysterious stranger heard me with a smile, and then mildly replied: “This is no dream; the time has arrived for dormant patriotism to arouse, and for those who are destined to defend their country to commence that sacred duty.” “My surprize, if possible, was heightened by this address; and though I was fully convinced that I was still dreaming, I felt an ardent curiosity to hear an explanation of his meaning. I therefore asked him, as I received the weapon, what danger threatened the safety or happiness of my country. To which he answered: “The Wabash will run with human blood before the dawn of morning. Even now the ambush is laid, the tomahawk raised, and the scalping-knife sharpened. Treachery lurks round the white men's camp. A prophet strikes at the heart of your country: and all this is but the bloody prelude of a long and more dreadful contention, 15 the result of which will depend on that of the approaching battle. If the valor of white men foil the treachery and ferocity of the cruel foe, then the Champions of Freedom will conquer in the subsequent contest with a mighty empire. If not— Washington has lived in vain, and the blood of patriots flowed for nothing.” “Admitting your assertion and prediction to be true,” I replied, “still, why am I called upon? There are thousands more capable of serving their country, who possess hands to raise in her defence.” “You have a son, whom you devoted to his country before you knew that he existed. Him have I lately seen basking in the treacherous sunshine of ease and pleasure. Rouse him to a sense of his duty, and the high calling to which he is destined. The day approaches that will light him to the field. Before he can fully acquire the art of defence, the soil of Freedom will be prest by foreign hostile steps, and stained with the blood of her children.” “Prophet! spirit! angel! or devil!” I exclaimed; “whatever you are, should the event of the coming morning verify your prediction, I will comply with your injunctions. Nay, more—my son shall receive my consent to follow the bent of his inclination, which I know will immediately lead him from college to the army. But satisfy me on one point: You seem to be a man; at any rate you wear not the countenance of a demon; how happens it that you bear so strong a resemblance to that picture?” “Resemblances,” answered he, “are no proofs of identity. Many a man has been mistaken for another.” “But tell me,” said I, “what is your name? to what tribe do you belong?—and how gained you admittance here? “Your sister sleeps,” said he, pointing to the bed, without noticing my question; “she will shortly sleep to wake no more on earth.” “My eyes were directed for a moment to your aunt; she moved, and I flew to the couch. She did not awake, and I returned to resume the conference with my mysterious guest; when, guess my astonishment, he had disappeared! No door had opened—no footstep had sounded—but the chief was nowhere to be found. “Surely—surely this is nothing but a dream!” I exclaimed with a vehemence that awakened the nurse. “What is the matter, sir?” cried she, starting from the chair in which she had been so long snoring by the side of the bed. “Matter!” I exclaimed—“come to me quick! take hold of me! shake me—wake me!” “Wake you!” repeated the good woman, rubbing her eyes, and then staring with the most unaffected surprise—“'tant possible, sure, that you are talking and walking in your sleep?” “I made her no answer, for at that moment I conceived a plan of ascertaining, the next day, whether I had been thus imposed upon by an illusive dream or not, and this plan I resolved to put into immediate execution. I opened my escritoir and wrote down the particulars as above stated, which I deposited in a certain pigeon-hole, and once more threw myself into the easy-chair, and fell into an undisturbed slumber which lasted until after sunrise. “For nearly the whole day I avoided my escritoir, being determined, in the first place, to convince myself fully that I was not only awake, but in my right reason. I conversed a little with your aunt, who had slept quietly till morning, and seemed much relieved; I chatted a while with the nurse, directed the threshers in the barns, visited Cleveland, and transacted business with several people; until every doubt was removed as to the sanity of my mind, or the wakefulness of my body. Then, towards evening, I ventured to look for my singular narrative, and found it in the spot where I left it; and yet, notwithstanding all this mass of evidence, I almost doubted my own senses. “A few days, however, removed all doubts from my mind. Yesterday morning an express passed the Grove on the way to Erie, bearing the intelligence of a dreadful battle that was fought, last Thursday morning, by the army under general Harrison, with the combined Indians under the Shawanoe prophet. As the particulars of this battle may not have reached Boston, I will relate them as far as communicated by the express, who stopped a few minutes at my house for refreshment. “On the twenty-ninth of October last, the governor of Indiana, with a small army, left Fort Harrison, on an expedition, the object of which was to break up a combination formed by the Shawanoe prophet on the Wabash, inimical to the tranquility and interests of the United States. “After a long and hazardous march, they reached the prophet's town on Wednesday, the sixth instant. Here the general held a parley with some chiefs who met him for that purpose, when it was mutually agreed to suspend all further discussion until the next day, and that, in the mean time, no hostile step should be taken on either side. “The American army then encamped on the banks of the Wabash, but were attacked the next morning, a little after four o'clock, by a host of savages, led by the treacherous prophet; and so sudden and unexpected was the assault, that it fared hard with many of our brave countrymen, some of whom were scalped in their tents. The Americans formed, however, with all possible expedition, and after a sharp contest of two hours, succeeded in beating them off with great loss, and the victory was decided with the bayonet. Two hundred fell wounded on our side, about seventy of them never to rise again. A much larger number of the Indians were destroyed, and the prophet's town was burnt to ashes. “Thus, my son, was literally fulfilled one prediction of the Mysterious Chief. Who can this being be? I am not superstitious; but `there are things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in our philosophy.' Is he supernatural? But I forbear to ask questions of one as unable to satisfy these doubts as I am myself. Whoever he be, I shall comply with my engagement, and you have my free consent to enter the army or navy as soon as you please. The relinquishment of your studies will be a great sacrifice, but if we are on the eve of a war, as this unknown Indian has predicted, you cannot too soon commence a military life. `In time of peace prepare for war,' is the language of the hero whose name you bear, and whose sword you are to wield. I know your generous, daring spirit, and unless it has been much relaxed by the new sphere in which you are moving, your soul is now `in arms, and eager for the 15* fray.' A very singular agent was made the instrument to announce your birth; a very singular agent now claims your services for our common country. `I have a son to redeem my vow.' “I possess sufficient influence at the seat of government to procure you a commission, but shall not apply for it until you accompany me thither in person. I shall set out immediately for Boston, so that you will not do wrong to expect me in the first week of December. I have been informed that a bill will be shortly laid before congress, which will probably pass, for raising an army of thirty thousand men, so that our application will be in good season. “As to the marvellous part of this letter, I would recommend you to keep it a secret for the present; possibly we may yet discover a clue to unravel the mystery. The particulars of the Wabash battle will soon appear in all the newspapers. It is probable that the account I have given is not correct in all its parts. “Harrison, you have heard me mention, was aid to the gallant Wayne, in the battle of your birth-day; he is a man of fine talents, and possesses a perfect knowledge of the topography of this state and the adjacent territories. “The pretended prophet who has thus led these deluded people to ruin, is brother to that Tecumseh, whose inveterate animosity against the people of the United States you have heard Logan mention. Some of the newspapers have represented him to be Red Jacket, the celebrated warrior who commanded the Indians by whom we were defeated, in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two, under St. Clair. But this I know to be incorrect. He was indeed in that battle, but was then too young to command. It is said that at the age of fifteen, this Indian disappeared from his relatives, and was considered as finally lost; that he strolled to Quebec, and from thence to Montreal, where he remained several years; and in this space received an education qualifying him to act the part of a prophet. Among the sciences which he studied, that of astronomy was his favorite, and the only one in which he made any considerable proficiency. By his calculations he discovered that a comet was about to make its appearance, whose orbit would approximate so near to that of our earth as to give rise to that tremulous motion which has lately been sensibly felt in several parts of the United States, the earth alternately preponderating between two great attractive powers. “With this calculation of the cometary influence in his pocket, the prophet left Quebec, and immediately set about forming the Wabash combination, instigated, no doubt, by his hot-headed brother, the fiery Tecumseh. He went on an embassy to the Creeks, in the month of August last, and required them to unite in the northern coalition, and on their refusing, he solemnly announced, in the public square, that `a lamp would shortly appear in the west to aid him in his hostile attack upon the whites; and that if they would not be influenced by his persuasion, the earth would ere long tremble to its centre.' “The lamp is in the west—the earth has shaken. No wonder that these circumstances should have had a powerful effect on the minds of these untutored Indians, and tended greatly to strengthen the confederacy. I shall be but a few days behind this letter. Adieu.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Mulberry Grove, Ohio, Nov. 12, 1811. “My Son—I have strange things to tell you— events that will excite your “special wonder,” and which may almost cause you to doubt the veracity of your father. Attend, therefore, while I relate a series of facts as extraordinary as any that ever figured in romance, either ancient or modern. “In my last I mentioned the illness of your aunt—I then considered it trifling; but yesterday her mortal part was committed to its sister earth. “On Wednesday evening last, the sixth instant, she appeared to be considerably better, conversed cheerfully, and desired me to seek for some repose, as for the three preceding nights and days I had scarcely closed an eye. A little after eleven o'clock, she fell into a quiet sleep; when commending her to the care of the nurse, I composed myself in the old easy chair, wrapped in my great-coat, before a cheerful fire. It was some time, however, before sleep visited my eyes; my mind was occupied with far distant events, and the picture of the Mysterious Chief hung immediately in my view over the fire-place. The contemplation of this object insensibly led me into a train of reflections, with which you was necessarily connected, and in this frame of mind I fell asleep. “My waking ideas pursued me in my dreams; and wild forests, frightful precipices, treacherous ambuscades, and tented fields, floated in wild confusion before my bewildered fancy. At length, events appeared to occur in a more regular and connected series; the battle of Miami rapids was fought over again, with all its attendant particulars, and the oracular corpse lay stretched before me. “Suddenly, the scene was changed, and I found myself wandering alone on the shores of Erie; no habitation was visible, all seemed desolate, and I felt lost and bewildered. In the midst of my perplexity, I saw the figure of a man with a drawn sword in his hand, emerging from the wood with a slow and solemn step. It was the same form that I had left lifeless on the battle-field, but no wound nor blood was now visible. With a dignified step, he advanced to the place where I was standing, and with a smile of benignity tendered me his weapon; but in attempting to take it, my hand trembled, and the sword fell to the ground with a noise that awakened me. “I started from my chair, and found by the clock that I had slept more than two hours. I advanced softly to the bed, and found both patient and nurse in a sound sleep, and that of your aunt appeared so sweet and gentle that I forebore to awaken the nurse, and feeling considerably refreshed by my nap, determined to watch the remainder of the night myself. “I left the bed and walked to the window, where I amused myself awhile in gazing on the etherial expanse glowing with myriads of golden stars; the waning moon was riding “in cloudless majesty” over the eastern forests, and her silver rays glittered on the bosom of the frozen lake. “As I turned again towards the fire, my steps were impeded with something which, on examination, I found to be the sword of Washington. It had fallen, with its scabbard, from the hook by the window, and lay nearly unsheathed upon the floor. The noise produced by its falling must have been that which awakened me so suddenly from my dream; but why it should have fallen—(and at that particular moment too)—was a mystery I could not unravel. In my dream, the sword presented by the chief had fallen from my hand, either through carelessness or terror. What did that portend? The one I now replaced on the hook, had long been idle in its scabbard. Was it a reproof for remissness? That could not be, for my country had all that time been at peace. Did this weapon, —“Self unscabbarded, foreshow The footsteps of a secret foe?”* * Scott's Lady of the Lake. “While indulging such reflections, I again threw myself into the chair; and, without intending it, was instantly asleep. My former dream returned with all its particulars, and I was again awakened in exactly the same manner, for —“A clang Of angry steel that instant rang.”* With a kind of instinct I turned my eyes to the spot where I expected to see again the prostrate sword. I saw it not. The clock at that moment struck three. “I feel, my son, a reluctance to proceed; for you will immediately suspect that watching and anxiety have turned your poor father's brain. But, think of it as you will, I will leave nothing untold. The same figure that appeared in my dream, the exact counterpart of the picture on the wall, in the same dress, and with the same aspect, stood before me! “I was not in the least terrified, though the circumstance was such as would naturally produce that sensation. To have unexpectedly discovered an armed savage in my house at midnight, hovering round the couch of slumber, would, at any other time, have much alarmed me; but now I only felt surprised that a dream could thus be continued after I believed myself to be awake. I rubbed my eyes, and involuntarily exclaimed, “Is it possible!” still slowly advancing to the mysterious apparition, who smiled as I approached, with the same aspect of dignified benignity that I admired in my dream. “My sword was in his hand! but not undrawn. He gracefully presented me the hilt, with the same courteous smile and majestic attitude that graced the immortal hero who first tendered it to my acceptance. “Take it,” said he in accents that thrilled to my very soul; “take it, and redeem your vow.” “I had never forgotten the tones of that mysterious voice which announced your birth. I now heard them again. After staring a moment in astonishment, I exclaimed.—“Am I asleep or awake? This is, indeed, a most singular dream!” “The mysterious stranger heard me with a smile, and then mildly replied: “This is no dream; the time has arrived for dormant patriotism to arouse, and for those who are destined to defend their country to commence that sacred duty.” “My surprize, if possible, was heightened by this address; and though I was fully convinced that I was still dreaming, I felt an ardent curiosity to hear an explanation of his meaning. I therefore asked him, as I received the weapon, what danger threatened the safety or happiness of my country. To which he answered: “The Wabash will run with human blood before the dawn of morning. Even now the ambush is laid, the tomahawk raised, and the scalping-knife sharpened. Treachery lurks round the white men's camp. A prophet strikes at the heart of your country: and all this is but the bloody prelude of a long and more dreadful contention, 15 the result of which will depend on that of the approaching battle. If the valor of white men foil the treachery and ferocity of the cruel foe, then the Champions of Freedom will conquer in the subsequent contest with a mighty empire. If not— Washington has lived in vain, and the blood of patriots flowed for nothing.” “Admitting your assertion and prediction to be true,” I replied, “still, why am I called upon? There are thousands more capable of serving their country, who possess hands to raise in her defence.” “You have a son, whom you devoted to his country before you knew that he existed. Him have I lately seen basking in the treacherous sunshine of ease and pleasure. Rouse him to a sense of his duty, and the high calling to which he is destined. The day approaches that will light him to the field. Before he can fully acquire the art of defence, the soil of Freedom will be prest by foreign hostile steps, and stained with the blood of her children.” “Prophet! spirit! angel! or devil!” I exclaimed; “whatever you are, should the event of the coming morning verify your prediction, I will comply with your injunctions. Nay, more—my son shall receive my consent to follow the bent of his inclination, which I know will immediately lead him from college to the army. But satisfy me on one point: You seem to be a man; at any rate you wear not the countenance of a demon; how happens it that you bear so strong a resemblance to that picture?” “Resemblances,” answered he, “are no proofs of identity. Many a man has been mistaken for another.” “But tell me,” said I, “what is your name? to what tribe do you belong?—and how gained you admittance here? “Your sister sleeps,” said he, pointing to the bed, without noticing my question; “she will shortly sleep to wake no more on earth.” “My eyes were directed for a moment to your aunt; she moved, and I flew to the couch. She did not awake, and I returned to resume the conference with my mysterious guest; when, guess my astonishment, he had disappeared! No door had opened—no footstep had sounded—but the chief was nowhere to be found. “Surely—surely this is nothing but a dream!” I exclaimed with a vehemence that awakened the nurse. “What is the matter, sir?” cried she, starting from the chair in which she had been so long snoring by the side of the bed. “Matter!” I exclaimed—“come to me quick! take hold of me! shake me—wake me!” “Wake you!” repeated the good woman, rubbing her eyes, and then staring with the most unaffected surprise—“'tant possible, sure, that you are talking and walking in your sleep?” “I made her no answer, for at that moment I conceived a plan of ascertaining, the next day, whether I had been thus imposed upon by an illusive dream or not, and this plan I resolved to put into immediate execution. I opened my escritoir and wrote down the particulars as above stated, which I deposited in a certain pigeon-hole, and once more threw myself into the easy-chair, and fell into an undisturbed slumber which lasted until after sunrise. “For nearly the whole day I avoided my escritoir, being determined, in the first place, to convince myself fully that I was not only awake, but in my right reason. I conversed a little with your aunt, who had slept quietly till morning, and seemed much relieved; I chatted a while with the nurse, directed the threshers in the barns, visited Cleveland, and transacted business with several people; until every doubt was removed as to the sanity of my mind, or the wakefulness of my body. Then, towards evening, I ventured to look for my singular narrative, and found it in the spot where I left it; and yet, notwithstanding all this mass of evidence, I almost doubted my own senses. “A few days, however, removed all doubts from my mind. Yesterday morning an express passed the Grove on the way to Erie, bearing the intelligence of a dreadful battle that was fought, last Thursday morning, by the army under general Harrison, with the combined Indians under the Shawanoe prophet. As the particulars of this battle may not have reached Boston, I will relate them as far as communicated by the express, who stopped a few minutes at my house for refreshment. “On the twenty-ninth of October last, the governor of Indiana, with a small army, left Fort Harrison, on an expedition, the object of which was to break up a combination formed by the Shawanoe prophet on the Wabash, inimical to the tranquility and interests of the United States. “After a long and hazardous march, they reached the prophet's town on Wednesday, the sixth instant. Here the general held a parley with some chiefs who met him for that purpose, when it was mutually agreed to suspend all further discussion until the next day, and that, in the mean time, no hostile step should be taken on either side. “The American army then encamped on the banks of the Wabash, but were attacked the next morning, a little after four o'clock, by a host of savages, led by the treacherous prophet; and so sudden and unexpected was the assault, that it fared hard with many of our brave countrymen, some of whom were scalped in their tents. The Americans formed, however, with all possible expedition, and after a sharp contest of two hours, succeeded in beating them off with great loss, and the victory was decided with the bayonet. Two hundred fell wounded on our side, about seventy of them never to rise again. A much larger number of the Indians were destroyed, and the prophet's town was burnt to ashes. “Thus, my son, was literally fulfilled one prediction of the Mysterious Chief. Who can this being be? I am not superstitious; but `there are things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in our philosophy.' Is he supernatural? But I forbear to ask questions of one as unable to satisfy these doubts as I am myself. Whoever he be, I shall comply with my engagement, and you have my free consent to enter the army or navy as soon as you please. The relinquishment of your studies will be a great sacrifice, but if we are on the eve of a war, as this unknown Indian has predicted, you cannot too soon commence a military life. `In time of peace prepare for war,' is the language of the hero whose name you bear, and whose sword you are to wield. I know your generous, daring spirit, and unless it has been much relaxed by the new sphere in which you are moving, your soul is now `in arms, and eager for the 15* fray.' A very singular agent was made the instrument to announce your birth; a very singular agent now claims your services for our common country. `I have a son to redeem my vow.' “I possess sufficient influence at the seat of government to procure you a commission, but shall not apply for it until you accompany me thither in person. I shall set out immediately for Boston, so that you will not do wrong to expect me in the first week of December. I have been informed that a bill will be shortly laid before congress, which will probably pass, for raising an army of thirty thousand men, so that our application will be in good season. “As to the marvellous part of this letter, I would recommend you to keep it a secret for the present; possibly we may yet discover a clue to unravel the mystery. The particulars of the Wabash battle will soon appear in all the newspapers. It is probable that the account I have given is not correct in all its parts. “Harrison, you have heard me mention, was aid to the gallant Wayne, in the battle of your birth-day; he is a man of fine talents, and possesses a perfect knowledge of the topography of this state and the adjacent territories. “The pretended prophet who has thus led these deluded people to ruin, is brother to that Tecumseh, whose inveterate animosity against the people of the United States you have heard Logan mention.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. HOSTILE INDICATIONS. Peace itself should not so dull a nation (Though war, nor no known quarrel were in question) But that defences, musters, preparations, Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected, As were a war in expectation. Shaks. Henry V. On the fifth day of December, major Willoughby again embraced his children. He arrived in Boston, but repaired immediately to Cambridge, and had a long conference with his son, who almost petrified him with astonishment by recounting his own interview with the Mysterious Chief, at the masquerade, on the same night, and nearly in the same hour that his father conversed with a similar being, on the same subject, in the state of Ohio! Both felt a conviction that it was a call to duty which ought immediately to be obeyed; and, under this impression, our young hero took a formal leave of the illustrious seminary to which he had already become an ornament. The tenth day of the month had been appointed for the nuptial ceremony to crown the happiness of four amiable beings; but, since the death of her aunt, Amelia had petitioned that the event might be deferred until the following summer, and urged as her reason, the impropriety of being married in sables. But to this proposition she gained no assenting voice, and it was at length overruled by the major himself, who refused to admit that the death of the old was a rational cause for delaying the happiness of the young, and the ceremony accordingly took place on the day appointed. Amelia and Ellen had been but three days brides, when the sunshine of their felicity was overcast with a temporary cloud that produced a plentiful shower before it was dissipated. To speak without a figure, their parting with George was a most affecting scene, particularly to Amelia, who had never existed a fortnight without embracing her brother, since his birth. His absence was now to be indefinite—unlimited—perhaps hazardous. But the reader's patience need not be intruded on. Let it suffice, that major Willoughby and his son took lodgings in the city of Washington near Capitol hill, on the eighteenth of the month. Congress was then in session, and the city, as usual, so filled with strangers, that our new comers found it extremely difficult to get suitably accommodated. An approaching rupture with England was here openly talked of, both by members of the cabinet, and by individuals in both houses of Congress. The bill for increasing the army was in debate, and daily gaining ground and popularity; our hero, therefore, lost no time in filing an application in the war department for an ensigncy in the United States infantry. From the weight of the recommendations which accompanied this application, no doubt was entertained of its success, and the major was determined to continue with his son until his final destination was known; in the mean time, however, he received a pressing invitation to spend the holidays with a friend in Richmond, and accordingly set out for that place, on the morning of the twenty-second, accompanied by George, and arrived there in season for celebrating the festival of Christmas. On the following day they dined with a select party at the house of his excellency, George W. Smith, governor of Virginia, where our hero met with an opportunity, for which he had long sighed, of cultivating an acquaintance with those who, like himself, had chosen the profession of arms. Several officers of the army and navy were present, and among the latter class was lieutenant Gibbon. This amiable, brave, and accomplished young man, was the son of a revolutionary officer who had valiantly served his country in “the times which tried men's souls.” Possessing an enterprizing disposition, young Gibbon had early entered as a midshipman, and was now a lieutenant in the navy; he had served in the Mediterranean, and was on board the Philadelphia frigate when that ship fell into the power of the Tripolitans. Long and tedious were the months of his captivity, but he submitted to every privation and hardship without a murmur; his unbending fortitude rose superior to calamity, and bore him up through all the miseries his oppressors could inflict. After his release from captivity, and his return to his native country, he contracted an attachment for a lovely female in Richmond, which was rewarded with a reciprocal sentiment. This young lady possessed every requisite to insure happiness in the conjugal state; virtue, beauty, wealth, and every fascinating accomplishment, enriched her in an eminent degree, and Gibbon was now anxiously awaiting the happy day which was to crown his wishes, and make him supremely blest. Preliminaries were already arranged, the bower of felicity was before him, and the path to happiness seemed short and easy. Such was the character, and such were the prospects of lieutenant Gibbon, when George was introduced to him at Richmond. He took his leave of the party at an early hour; not, however, without assuring major Willoughby (who had been intimate with his father) that he would pay his respects to him on the following day at his lodgings, and receiving the promise of George to join him at the theatre in the course of the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. A DISASTROUS EVENT. Whence the wild wail of agonizing wo That heaves each breast, and bids each eye o'erflow? Ab, me! amid the all-involving gloom That wraps the victims of terrific doom, While palsied Fancy casts an anguish'd glance, What frenzied spectres to my view advance! Appalled Nature shrinks—my harrow'd soul Dares not the direful scene of death unrol! Anon. An interesting play, entitled Family Feuds, had been announced for representation at the theatre, for the benefit of Placide; and the governor, with several of his friends, proposed to patronize the performance. The Major declined the proposition, but his son accompanied the party. It was the best house the season had afforded, and the play went off with great eclat. The afterpiece was the interesting pantomime of the “Bleeding Nun,” which commenced amid the plaudits of the admiring audience. George had read the eccentric romance from which this pantomime was selected, and consequently the plot of the piece was familiar to his recollection. The gallant Raymond saves his beloved Agnes from the most imminent danger, and bears her away in his arms. George thought of his Catharine, and, when the curtain fell on the first act, sat absorbed in tender recollections. “How happy,” thought he, “must that lover be who saves from destruction the idol of his soul! What rapture must be mingled with the sensations which heave their meeting bosoms, as he afterwards presses her in his arms! Grant, O my God, that I may be placed in such a blissful situation; grant that Catharine may owe her precious life to my courage and exertions; permit and enable me but to bear her from danger in these longing arms, and I ask no more!” A most delightful piece of music from the orchestra awoke him from the pleasing reverie, and he gazed around on the happy faces that every where met his view. On no former occasion had the theatre of Richmond exhibited a more brilliant assemblage of beauty, taste and fashion; and never, perhaps, was such an assembly more disposed to be happy. Every bosom bounded with pleasure—every eye beamed with satisfaction; care was forgotten, and incessant flashes of wit and merriment bespoke the lightness of the hearts from whence they emanated. The curtain rose on the second act of the pantomime, the orchestra was in full chorus, and an actor came forward to open the scene, when sparks of fire were seen to fall on the back part of the stage, and Robertson advanced, waving his hand to the ceiling, and exclaiming that the house was on fire! His hand was immediately stretched forth to the persons in the stage box to help them on the stage, and aid their retreat in that direction. The heart-appalling cry of fire! fire! now passed with electric velocity through the house, and all who were not rendered insensible by terror, flew from their seats to gain the lobbies and stairs. The scene that ensued baffles all description. The most heart-piercing cries pervaded the house, of “Save me! O save me!” Wives calling for their husbands, females and children shrieking, while the gathering volumes of pitchy smoke came rolling onward, extinguishing the lights, and choaking respiration. Many were trodden under foot, the stairs were blocked up, and men, women, and children precipitated themselves from the windows into the street below, some with their garments in a blaze, and their persons dreadfully burnt. The governor, in attempting to save his child, perished with it, and several of the party in his box shared the same dreadful fate. George was in the adjoining box, with his new friend Gibbon, who had under his protection the young lady to whom he was affianced. When the tumult arose her sensibility was overpowered and she fainted; her lover raised her in his arms, and endeavored to force his way through the crowd; George offered his assistance, which Gibbon declined, declaring himself to be competent to the task, and entreating our hero to assist two young ladies, who had fallen in the next box, and were apparently without protectors. With great coolness and intrepidity Gibbon then continued to make his way through the opposing multitude, until exhausted with his exertions, and overtaken by the flames, he sunk with his lovely burden to rise no more! 16 Our hero instantly perceived that the passage from the pit offered the most probable chance of safety, and raising the young ladies who had fainted from terror in an adjoining box, he took one in each arm, leaped into the pit, and bore his insensible burdens, through the thick smoke and scorching flames, until he gained in safety the semi-circular avenue which led him to the door of the theatre. Here the fresh air partially revived the almost suffocated objects of his care, and they gained the street a few minutes before the roof fell in. “My sister!” exclaimed a gentleman, and snatched one of the ladies from the arms of her preserver. He bore the other through the distracted crowd, and seated her on a stone at the corner of the street. Here she appeared to awake at once to all the horrors of her situation, and starting up, with a piercing shriek, flew with such velocity towards the scene of conflagration that our hero could hardly overtake her. She sunk again into his arms, exclaiming, in a tone that thrilled George to the soul—“Save my father! O save my dear father!” The fire at that moment shone full on her face—it was Catharine. They were in the midst of a scene that it is impossible to describe. Women with dishevelled hair, calling on their husbands; fathers and mothers shrieking for their children; husbands for their wives, and brothers for their sisters, filled the whole area on the outside of the blazing ruins. Some, who had escaped, were plunging again into the flames, to save some dear object of their regard; others were frantic, and would have rushed to destruction, but for the restraining hand of a friend. The bells were ringing, and the whole town rushing to the fatal spot. What a spectacle here awaited the horror-struck citizens of Richmond! a whole theatre enwrapped in flames, a gay and animated assembly suddenly thrown on the very verge of the grave— many of them precipitated into eternity! Virtue, genius, beauty, youth, and old age, whelmed in one promiscuous ruin! shrieks of agony mingled with the crackling flames! Our hero had hitherto preserved his presence of mind! but recognising Catharine at that dreadful moment, and the uncertainty of her father's fate, on whom she was still calling with the voice of distraction, almost unmanned him; his brain was bewildered, and it was with difficulty that he could support the lovely girl in his arms. At that moment he found himself supported by the arm of his father. “Take her,” cried George; “to you I can entrust her. Bear her to a place of safety, while I seek her father.” Exhausted, and almost lifeless, she hung on the major's arm, who, with the assistance of a young officer whom he called to his aid, supported her to the nearest house, which by this time had become a hospital filled with those who had escaped with fractured limbs, dreadful bruises, and dangerous burns. But in the general consternation, individual griefs could not be attended to. Every one was flying in search of some near relative or dear connexion, and the wounded and dying were left to condole each other with their groans. Catharine, who had not been recognized by the major, was in a kind of stupor not unlike a swoon, and in that state was left in the care of the officer who assisted in removing her from the scene of danger, while Willoughby returned to assist his son in his humane exertions. Notwithstanding the dreadful scene around him, the young stranger could not refrain from gazing on the beautiful insensible reclining on his arm. Her hair was loose, and floated wildly over her shoulders and neck; her eyes were closed, her bosom heaved, and her whole dress was disordered. He rudely gazed on charms thus heightened by distress, and almost forgot the disaster that had submitted them to his inspection. In a few minutes a man rushed into the room, whose scorched and disfigured dress scarcely retained any distinguishing marks of the sex to which it belonged. He was without a hat, and his head was severely burnt. “Where is she?” he exclaimed—“O where is my child?” and Catharine was pressed to her father's bosom, where she soon recovered her recollection, and expressed her joy in tears and sobs. As soon as she became sufficiently composed, they repaired to their lodgings, accompanied by the officer, who insisted upon seeing his charge in perfect safety before he thought of his own concerns. “O my generous preserver!” faintly exclaimed Catharine as he seated her on a sofa, “how shall I express my thanks?” “Your thanks are only due to Heaven,” answered he; “I have only done my duty; and had I lost my life in snatching you from the flames—” “How were you so fortunate as to save her?” interrupted Fleming. Officer. I saw her fall in the lobby, sir, and flew to her assistance. The pressure of the crowd was so great, and the smoke so suffocating, that I almost despaired of success; but was resolved to save or perish with her. Fleming. But why such an interest for her fate in particular, among hundreds who were in situations equally perilous, and who possessed equal claims to your assistance? Are you acquainted with us? Officer. No, sir. But—I sat in the next box to you this evening. I saw your daughter—I accidentally heard her appropriate and judicious observations—I felt that she was worthy the risk I ran.” As he said this he gently pressed her hand, which he held in his. Fleming. Why did you not tarry in the box, my child, as I requested? I was back in a moment, after ascertaining that it was easy to escape through the pit. What was my horror on not finding you in the spot where I had left you! I leaped into the boxes, and rushed into the lobby, calling on your name, but could nowhere find you. Overcome with suffocation, I fell to the floor, with my head against the wall. A little stream of fresh air issuing through a crack, revived me, and I again arose, with a determination to leap from the window, which was at that moment burst open. When I had nearly reached it, however, I almost despaired of effecting my escape through it, for the crowds that blocked it up. I pushed forward with desperation, while many dropped on all sides of me to rise no more. I mounted on the heads of the crowd, with my hair and clothes on fire, burst through the window, and reached the ground in safety. Here I again called aloud on your name, and ran like a madman among the multitude to find you, and was even on the point of rushing back into the flames, when a 16* friendly hand restrained me. I know not who, but some one called me by name, and told me that my daughter was in safety at the house we have just left. I hastened thither, and found you insensible, tenderly supported by this gentleman, who has risked his own life to preserve yours. Had I a thousand lives, sir, they should all be devoted to the preserver of my child. How shall we express our gratitude? Officer. You pain me, sir, by this language. I am richly rewarded by the consciousness of having preserved this lady. Do not lessen my happiness by talking of gratitude. Here he again pressed the hand of Catharine, and added in a whisper—“I will not object to your thanking me, for then I shall again hear that angelic voice.” Catharine, however, was silent, withdrew her hand, and sighed deeply. In the next moment she burst into tears, and exclaimed aloud, “O, why was I preserved!” “Be composed, my child,” said Fleming, pressing her to his bosom; “the dreadful scene of this evening has affected you too deeply. Permit Mrs. Crosby (the lady of the house) to conduct you to your chamber. Repose will, I hope, restore both your health and recollection.” Catharine complied in silence, and was consigned to the care of a faithful nurse; while Mrs. Crosby returned with cordials, balsams, and plasters, for the wounds of her father, which now began to pain him extremely. The officer rose to take his leave. “We must see you again, when more composed,” said Fleming, “in order to thank you as we ought. In the mean time, oblige us with your name.” The stranger hesitated a moment, and then answered—“Thomas Sandford. I must now tear myself away to assist other sufferers in this dreadful disaster, but will most certainly see you again.” Major Willoughby and his son were prevented by an accident from following Fleming immediately to the house to which his daughter had been conducted—accompany him they could not, for his speed outstript the wind. George, however, was there in a few minutes after their departure, but no Catharine was to be seen, nor could he, from all his inquiries, find any one that might assist him in the search. His father had left her in the care of an officer, but who he was, or whither he was gone, he was totally ignorant. Trusting, however, that both daughter and father were in safety, he hoped to discover their lodgings on the following morning, and therefore retired to his own, to snatch a little necessary repose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. DISSIMULATION. Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed; For he's disposed as the hateful raven. Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him; For he's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf. Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit? Shaks. Henry VI. When Sandford withdrew from Harvard University, to avoid the disgrace of a public expulsion, he turned his attention to a military life; and, through the influence of his mother's friends, obtained a captain's commission, and assumed the command of a small garrison in the state of Virginia. He anticipated no hostilities, and only aspired to become the hero of a drawing-room, and display a rich uniform on a holiday parade. He had contracted an intimacy with several young dashers of similar character, and squandered, at brothels and the gaming-table, not only all his pay, but also the bountiful supplies remitted him by his mother. The alarming cry of fire had, this evening, interrupted a game at billiards, in which he was engaged, and he was approaching the scene of conflagration as an idle spectator, when major Willoughby requested his assistance in conveying his lovely charge to a place of safety, with so much earnestness, that he could not refuse. But, no sooner had he obtained a full view of the charming but senseless Catharine, than his fiend-like heart conceived the horrid idea of her seduction, and he only awaited her return to life and recollection to convey her far distant from the reach of her friends, if she had any to seek after her. This diabolical plan, however, was frustrated by the sudden appearance of her father; when it was immediately changed to another of equal enormity, though of less precipitancy. He would accompany them to their lodgings, claim the merit of the daughter's preservation, engage her gratitude, and all the rest was easy to accomplish. The ready lie he invented appeared very plausible, and both father and daughter were elated with gratitude. So far he was successful; but could he have read the pure heart he was studying to corrupt, he would have discovered an image, which she was contemplating at the very moment when he flattered himself that his own was imparting an impression there. She withdrew her hand, and sighed, while reflections like the following crowded on her mind: “O that George Willoughby had been my preserver! But he is far off, and knew not the danger of his Catharine. How unhappy would he have been, had I perished like the rest! Compared with his, the anguish of such a death would have been trifling and momentary. O my God, teach me to be sufficiently grateful that he is spared such a trial. But whither am I wandering? Foolish girl! Perhaps he has forgotten me! Perhaps he loves another! If that should be the case, O why was I preserved?” Here busy thought burst through the organs of speech, and the exclamation (as before stated) was imputed by her father to a temporary delirium. Sandford failed not in the promised repetition of his visit. He called early the next day, and found Fleming confined to his bed, in a high fever, with his daughter sitting by the side of his pillow, watching over him with the tenderest anxiety. She rose as he entered the room, and with a faint smile presented him her hand, which he pressed with fervor to his lips. She disapproved of his freedom, but felt too much depression of spirits to chide any one—least of all the preserver of her life. Her father was in a disturbed slumber, interrupted by frequent starts and unintelligible exclamations. His left temple was severely burnt, and the whole side of his head extremely swelled and inflamed. Besides this, he had received a dangerous contusion on the right shoulder, in his fall from the window of the theatre. His physician, however, assured Catharine that rest and tranquility would speedily restore him. It was no time for Sandford to introduce the topic of love; he only indirectly intimated what would have been his theme under more happy auspices. At the present interview, he contented himself with tender glances, affectionate tones, and the most respectful attentions. He pretended to have passed a sleepless morning, merely from his fears on her account, and should now continue excessively unhappy until her dear father was restored to health. Catharine was melted with gratitude for such kindness in a stranger, and, on his taking leave, could do no less than mingle a general visiting invitation with her thanks; all of which this paragon of vanity interpreted in favor of his unhallowed wishes. In the mean time, major Willoughby and his son were seeking in vain to discover the lodgings of Fleming and his daughter. The whole city was in tears, and their inquiries were disregarded. On the day following the dreadful event, an extraordinary meeting of the city council was held, at which four gentlemen were appointed as a committee to superintend the funeral rites due to those unfortunate sufferers whose remains might not be claimed by relatives; to cause them to be collected and enclosed in urns, coffins, or other suitable receptacles, and publicly interred, with all proper respect and solemnity, and to give notice to the citizens of Richmond and Manchester of the time at which such interment would take place. This committee were also empowered to cause suitable monuments to be erected over their ashes, with such inscriptions as would be best calculated to record the melancholy and affecting catastrophe. The council also recommended an entire suspension of business for forty-eight hours; and ordained, that for four months thereafter, no public show or spectacle, or open dancing assembly should be exhibited or held in the city, under a heavy penalty. A very numerous meeting of the citizens was held at the Capitol the same day, at which another committee was appointed, to inquire into the causes of this afflicting calamity, to trace the particulars of its disastrous progress, and to ascertain the extent of its melancholy effects. From the report of this committee, it appeared that eighty-five persons had perished in this dreadful conflagration. For several days the Willoughbys continued their search; but compelled at length to relinquish the vain pursuit, George accompanied his father to Washington, almost in a state of despair. He had clasped Catharine in his arms; nay, more—he had saved her precious life, and rescued her from the most dreadful of deaths. This was a literal answer to his impious prayer. Had it made him happy? Alas! no—he was miserable in the extreme. Vain, presumptuous man! Were heaven literally to grant every wish of our selfish hearts, earth would soon become a hell, and universal damnation succeed. No supplication should ever rise from the human heart to which an earthly idea is attached—nothing, relative to the dispensations of Providence, but “thy will be done,” should ever pass the human lips. We are expressly forbidden to pray or even to “take thought” for temporal blessings; and are as expressly promised, that if we seek first for spiritual ones, the others shall be added thereto. “Not happiness herself makes good her aim, “Our very wishes give us not our wish.” Many letters of inquiry were sent to Richmond, but no tidings could be obtained of Fleming or his daughter. On the second day of January the army act became a law, and, in ten days after, our hero received his commission, and was attached to a regiment then raising in the District of Columbia. Here his father took leave of him, (after presenting him with the sword of Washington) and departed for the western country, promising to write immediately on his reaching Mulberry-grove, and communicate every information he could procure respecting the fate of Fleming and his daughter; as they must have either set out for that country, or written to Mrs. Fleming an account of their present situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. TREACHERY UNMASKED. He has profaned the sacred name of friend, And worn it into vileness: With how secure a brow and specious form He gilds the secret villain! Sure, that face Was meant for honesty, but Heav'n mismatch'd it; And furnish'd Treason out with Nature's pomp, To make its work more easy. Dryd. All for Love. About three months previous to the foregoing event, Fleming received letters advising him that the agent, to whose fraudulent conduct he imputed the sudden reduction of his fortune, had emigrated, with immense wealth, to America, and was settled in some part of Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. As Fleming had many reasons for wishing to obtain an interview with this man, he resolved upon making a journey to that state; and it was agreed that Catharine should accompany him as far as Pittsburg, on a visit to a female relation, with whom she was to remain until her father's return. At New-Lisbon, however, he learned that this relation was dead, and her children removed to Philadelphia; he therefore altered his plan, and, without stopping at Pittsburg, took his daughter with him to Philadelphia. At Lancaster, where they rested two days, he obtained some information of the object of his journey. Patrick Dobson had lately sold a considerable farm on the banks of the Susquehanna, and become a commission merchant in one of the southern cities; but in which of them, his informant could not tell. 17 After a short stay in Philadelphia, they travelled to Baltimore, and from thence to Norfolk, where Fleming learned that Dobson was then in Richmond, to which place they immediately returned. Here terminated their fruitless journey, for Dobson had sailed for the Indies a few days before their arrival. For several days after the disastrous event which had confined Fleming to his chamber, Sandford was punctual in his visits, and affected the greatest solicitude for his indisposition. During these interviews, he let slip no opportunity of acting the “diffident lover,” when unobserved by Fleming; and so great an adept was he in dissimulation, that a less artless girl than Catharine might have been deceived. She possessed too much discernment to misunderstand the silent language of love, which is most eloquent when least audible; but she knew too little of the world to detect a counterfeit, or to distinguish it from a genuine passion. She perceived with pain, that in her preserver's bosom was kindling an attachment which she could not return. She owed her life to his intrepidity, but could never repay the debt with that heart which she had long reserved for another. Although no express declaration or engagement had ever been interchanged by George and Catharine, yet their dove-like affection for each other hand produced in both a kind of intuitive idea of obligation—a sympathy in sentiment which absence had only tended to heighten, while its reciprocity was admitted as a matter of course. With this sentiment in her bosom, it would be embarrassing to hear the professions of another, and painful in the extreme, if that other should be the man to whom she was under such immense obligations. She trembled to think of it, and ardently prayed that her father's returning health might speedily enable him to take her from Richmond, and save her the painful trial she anticipated. Her prayer was not answered. Fleming slowly recovered; but, before his health was sufficiently re-established for him to commence so long a journey, Sandford had laid a regular siege to the citadel of Catharine's heart. Mistaking her gratitude for affection, he persevered with a zeal deserving a better cause, notwithstanding her prompt rejection of his overtures, and positive refusal to capitulate. Fortunately for Catharine, the impatience and impetuosity of the assailant defeated his own plans, and shortened the period of contest. He grew unguarded and daring, and made movements (too openly for their object to be mistaken) against the fortress of virtue. Catharine felt shocked and degraded by the discovery, but reaped an advantage from it which she could not otherwise have acquired. All obligation was, in one moment, absolved by the villany of his intentions. The wretch was entitled to no gratitude for preserving life, who could rob its possessor of all that renders life desirable—innocence and happiness. The debt was cancelled, and she forbade him her sight, in terms that he durst not disobey. Although he wore an epaulet, he was too great a coward to run the risk to which Catharine's complaint to her father would have inevitably exposed him; he therefore took the hint she gave, and discontinued his visits. She soon after left Richmond with her father, and arrived home in health and safety, a few days before major Willoughby reached Mulberry-Grove, who immediately communicated the circumstance to his anxious son. But Sandford had acquired a secret which made him resolve to persevere (at a more convenient opportunity) in his iniquitous pursuit. In one of his interviews with Fleming, the name of Willoughby was mentioned, and a few inquiries convinced him that his daughter was that very Catharine Fleming whose name, connected with the tenderest sentiments, had been confided to his treacherous bosom by the unsuspecting George. The disgrace of a blow, yet unatoned for, rankled in his breast, and he still smarted under the indignity, which he had not the courage openly to resent. But to seduce the affections of his adversary's mistress, enjoy her charms, and then abandon her to infamy and misery, would be a sweet revenge! a triumph worthy of Sandford! Thus urged on by a double impulse, he became too ardent in his advances, and, as before intimated, was dismissed in disgrace. Revenge alone now took entire possession of his soul, and he swore that no obstacle, time, or circumstance, should prevent its final gratification. “May Heaven's curses blast me,” he exclaimed as he traversed his chamber alone, the wretched victim of passions which he had never yet undertaken to subdue; “may hell's fiercest lightnings consume me, if I do not humble this proud Hibernian, with all her affected virtue, and mar the anticipated banquet of her sighing savage lover. He may wear the flower, after I have sipped its sweets, and engendered a venomous canker in its bosom. Yes! I will seek her in the wilds of Ohio, or follow her to the end of the world; and when we do meet, whether it be sooner or later, whether she be single or married, young or old, I will enjoy her; nor shall Heaven, earth, or hell, prevent me!” With this terrible oath on his lips, and such tempestuous passions in his heart, the wretched Sandford dared address himself to sleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. THE SOLDIER'S PROGRESS. Ambition never was my view, Though glory still has been my great pursuit; I would, by noble actions in her service, Deserve the utmost honors of my country; Nor higher do my thoughts affect to rise. Frowd's Fall of Sag. Beloved and respected by all who were worthy of his esteem, our young ensign applied himself incessantly to the study of military tactics, and in the course of three months outstript all his competitors in the theory of war, and ardently longed for an honorable occasion to reduce this theory to practice. During this period he had the satisfaction of becoming acquainted with many persons of worth and distinction, from whose conversation, manners, and experience, he acquired no little benefit. About the last of February, at Mrs. Madison's levee, he was introduced to commodore Bainbridge, who had just returned from a commercial voyage, for the prosecution of which he had obtained a furlough from the navy department. This gallant officer was now thirty-eight years of age, and for twenty years had been a “ploughman of the 17* deep.” He served with honor and success during the contest with France, and in the year eighteen hundred, received a captain's commission, when he was appointed to the command of the frigate George Washington, in which he shortly afterwards sailed for Algiers with the presents which the United States were by treaty bound to make to that regency. From Algiers he visited Constantinople, where he gave the Turks a high idea of the naval character of the United States, and returned to America in the month of April in the following year. In a few months after, he received the command of the frigate Essex, in which he again scoured the Mediterranean, to assist in chastising the insolence of the Barbarians, and after a cruise of twelve months, returned to New-York. In the year one thousand eight hundred and three, he was appointed to command the Philadelphia, a frigate built by the merchants of the city whose name she bore, and by them presented to the government. In her he once more sailed for the Mediterranean to join the American squadron under the command of commodore Preble. The unfortunate fate of this vessel has already been alluded to in a former chapter. Bainbridge, Gibbon, and the rest, became the captives of a barbarous and mercenary foe. When the termination of the Tripolitan war restored Bainbridge, with his gallant associates, to the bosom of their sympathising country, he was received (says his biographer) “rather as a returning conqueror than as a vanquished prisoner—a most unequivocal proof of public confidence, since that merit must indeed be sterling which could stand the test of such misfortunes.” Young Willoughby failed not to cultivate so valuable an acquaintance. In the society of the brave and generous only, he could find souls congenial to his own; and as the sentiment was mutual, they were equally assiduous to conciliate his esteem. His intimacy with Bainbridge, however, was soon interrupted by the departure of that gentleman for New-England, he having been appointed to the command of the navy-yard at Charlestown in Massachusetts, and of the public vessels on the eastern station. About the same time, in consequence of some new arrangements in the organization of the army, the officers of several regiments were transferred to others, and ensign Willoughby received orders to report himself to the commandant of a military post in the neighborhood of Norfolk. It was early in March when he obeyed these orders, and performed a journey of above two hundred miles, over roads which the season had rendered horrid beyond description. The general aspect of the country was as dreary as the hoisterous month in which he surveyed it, and every thing conspired to make the change disagreeable. But the duty of obedience was familiar to George, and even where its performance was painful, it was always accompanied with cheerfulness. As the spring advanced, however, our hero found his new situation very pleasant. When off duty he enjoyed frequent excursions through the beautiful scenes of Virginia—sometimes in contemplative solitude, but more frequently in the gay company of military and naval officers. The probability that an opportunity would be soon afforded of distinguishing themselves in the service of their country, was the “untired theme,” which gave an additional zest to these enjoyments, cherished the love of glory in their bosoms, and kept alive the hope of its speedy gratification. Although George thought as a hero, “he yet felt as a man.” Glory was the idol of his soul, but it was the glory of asserting and defending the rights of his country, not that of butchering his fellow-creatures. He knew that the golden halo might be, and often had been, won in an unrighteous cause; but he felt that one drop of unnecessary blood would so dim its lustre in the eye of virtue, that a genuine patriot would behold it with horror and spurn it with contempt. Much as he wished for fame, he would never seek it out of the path of duty; if it were attainable in that path, he was willing to encounter danger in its direst form to reach the glittering goal. He wished for war, because he thought it the only measure by which the honor and rights of his country could be maintained. “Had not the patriots of my father's day,” thought he, “resorted to the same dreadful alternative, when their rights were invaded, their sons would at this day have had no rights to protect; and ought we not to do as much for our posterity as our fathers have done for us?” The genuine principles of patriotism had been inculcated into him from an infant; the love of country was interwoven with his very existence; and a desire of serving her was the ruling passion of his heart. The conversation of his father, the education of his childhood, and the books he had read, all tended to render this principle permanent and lasting. It was too deep-rooted ever to be effaced. It occupied his daily thoughts, and intruded on his midnight dreams; it was the theme of his conversation in company, and the subject of his meditations in all his private walks. In one of his solitary rambles, through the most romantic parts of Norfolk county, “Where rural sweets and sylvan shades Conspire to yield delight,” he found himself bewildered with cross-roads, and stopped at a genteel-looking house to inquire the way to the village, where he had left his horse. The sun had set, and the sombre shades of evening had already begun to descend on the valleys, as he knocked at the door. He was received in a very courteous manner, by a gentleman, who informed him that the village was five miles distant, and the road not easily explored by a stranger in darkness; he was therefore pressed to tarry all night, to which, after some common-place apologies for the intrusion, he consented, and was entertained with all that generous hospitality which so eminently characterises the inhabitants of Virginia. Every thing like reserve, on either side, was quickly dissipated, and both host and guest became mutually pleased with each other. The name of the gentleman to whom our hero was thus accidentally introduced was Vaughan, a very respectable citizen, and an excellent man. He soon discovered in his guest a mind of no common cast, and listened with admiration to sentiments and aphorisms that would have become the lips of aged wisdom. Though the opinions and arguments of George were always expressed with peculiar modesty, they yet displayed a depth of thinking and a knowledge of the world that seldom failed of raising the speaker in the estimation of his opponent. On the present occasion our hero had imperceptibly introduced his favourite topic, the necessity of demanding of England a redress of national grievances, and of making the demand from the cannon's mouth. He entertained no doubt that government felt this necessity, and that congress would shortly pass a law to that effect. But whatever might have been the opinion of his host as to the necessity of a war, that gentleman doubted the speedy occurrence of such an event. Negociation appeared to be the favorite policy of the government, and that policy would probably still be adhered to. Many arguments were used in support of these different opinions. “It is natural to believe what we wish,” at length observed Vaughan; “and you gentlemen of the army appear to be much more sanguine on this point than those who are attached to the navy. The reason may be, that many of the latter already wear those laurels which the former are so eager to acquire.” “Some gentlemen of the navy, with whom I have conversed,” replied George, are not less sanguine on this subject than myself. The gallant Bainbridge, several weeks since, expressed it as his decided opinion that the present session of congress would not terminate without a declaration of war.” “Do you know lieutenant Elliot?” asked Vaughan. “Of the army?” “No, sir, of the Navy.” “Only by report,” replied George; “his father, Robert Elliot, was unfortunately slain by the Indians[13] [13] See Chap. ii. p. 7. in the same campaign, under general Wayne, in which my father lost a hand. I have often heard my father speak of him as a very particular friend, and that his death was the greatest misfortune he had, at that time, ever met with. Of the son I know nothing, but have heard that he sustained the reputation of a brave young man while a midshipman in the Mediterranean. He has since been promoted.” “Yes, sir, in June, eighteen hundred and ten, he was appointed acting lieutenant on board the Enterprize; and has since been sent with dispatches to Mr. Pinkney, our minister in London. Last year he served in the John Adams until September, when he was transferred to the Argus, on board of which he now acts as first lieutenant, although at present he is on a short furlough. During all this time, he has been preparing his mind for the severe duties of his profession, under the same impression which actuates yourself, the hope of a speedy opportunity of signalizing himself in his country's service.” “And does not that hope revive at the present indications of a rupture with England?” asked George. “He can perceive no such indications,” replied Vaughan; “or else he interprets them wrong. To use the language of an elegant writer, he is `fatigued in the chase of glory's brilliant visions that still sparkle over his head, and still elude his grasp;' he has therefore resigned his mind to the sway of the more endearing passions.” “I understand you,” said George with a smile, “he is in love.” “To-morrow, sir,” replied Vaughan, “with the permission of Providence, I shall call him son.” “I beg leave to congratulate you, sir, on the accession to your family of so amiable a member.” “I thank you, sir; and in return, if the duties of your profession will not imperiously forbid it, I shall take the liberty of insisting that you tarry with us to-morrow, and honor the ceremony with your presence.” After some hesitation, our hero consented, and it now growing late, he was conducted to a chamber, and left to repose. At breakfast, the next morning, (which was Sunday) he was introduced to the intended bride, the lovely Frances, blushing like the season, and, in a short time after, to the son of his father's friend, the gallant youth who was about to lead her to the altar of Hymen. They seemed mated by Heaven, and worthy of each other. “A matchless pair, “With equal virtue formed, and equal grace, “The same, distinguished by their sex alone; “Hers the mild lustre of the blooming morn, “And his the radiance of the risen day.” On the morning following their nuptials our hero bid the happy pair adieu, and taking a respectful leave of their hospitable parents, proceeded to the village for his horse, and returned to his quarters. Here an unexpected pleasure awaited him. A packet of letters was put into his hands, which he was informed had been left by a gentleman from Washington, who would call on him in the course of the day. He eagerly tore open the envelope, and in the superscriptions of four letters, recognized the hands of Amelia, Ellen, Morse, and his aunt; but had scarcely broken the seal of the first, when his cousin Aylwin seized him by the hand. The pleasure of this meeting was lively and reciprocal. George had a thousand fond inquiries to make, and he proposed them with such rapidity that Aylwin found it difficult to answer one in ten. At length, seizing the advantage of a momentary pause, he exclaimed: “To answer all your questions at once, your friends in Boston are all well in health, sound in intellect, and successful in business. For the state of their hearts, I refer you to their epistles. I arrived in Washington on Wednesday last, and should have been here yesterday, but for the carelessness of a stage-driver, who upset the carriage and broke an axle-tree.” “But what brought you to the seat of government?” “The invitation of captain Hull. I have applied to the department for a sailing-master's war-rant, which will probably be ready for me on my return. I shall then join the Constitution at Annapolis.” “A fine frigate and a noble commander,” exclaimed George; “may you load her with laurels.” “Amen,” responded Aylwin, “let me but have the opportunity and receive the orders to lay her alongside of the heaviest frigate in the British navy—hull to hull—then for the `unprofitable contest of trying which can do the other the most harm.' What is the name of the English frigate in the roads?” “The Macedonian, captain Carden; and that with the American flag is the United States, commanded by Decatur. Which would you bet on in case of a contest?” “On the Macedonian,” answered Aylwin, provided she was navigated by American seamen. As it is, on the United States. Heaven grant they may come as near to each other after war 18 is declared as they are now—I wish it for the honor of the American flag.” “And captain Carden wishes it for the honor of the British flag,” said George; “he is confident that with his frigate he could take Decatur's.” “Has he ever expressed such a confidence?” “He has,” replied George; “I had the honor of dining at the British consul's last week, at whose table Decatur and Carden were both present, besides a number of gentlemen of the army and navy, when the conversation turned on the comparative force of those two ships, their armament, and the number as well as excellence of their crews. Captain Carden then stated, that a British thirty-eight gun frigate was fully ascertained, by experience, to be the most efficient single-decked vessel that ever swam the ocean; that any increase of size was worse than useless, as it only rendered them more unmanageable, and concluded by saying, that from experience he felt satisfied he could take the United States with the Macedonian.” “What arrogant presumption!” “He palliated it,” continued George, “by adding, that he disclaimed any intention to question the skill or bravery of the American officers or seamen.” “Why, they once termed our frigates seventy-fours in disguise,” observed Aylwin. “Yes, and they have also called them `cock-boats with a piece of striped bunting at the masthead.' But whatever they may think of our little navy, an opportunity will soon offer for testing their opinion.” “I hope so,” exclaimed Aylwin. “But read your letters, for I must leave you for a short time, being charged with dispatches for several of the `sons of the deep,' which cannot be delivered too soon.” “I shall expect you at dinner.” “You had better not,” replied Aylwin, “for I shall board the United States, and there is too much hospitality among us sailors to suffer a comrade to depart empty. Adieu till evening.” “But do you bring no news from Washington?” inquired George. “How stands the political thermometer?” “Up to seventy-six, which I take to be blood heat. The war-fever has not abated, notwithstanding all the cooling prescriptions of certain political quacks.” “But does the disorder assume any new symptoms, of a less equivocal complexion?” “Yes, both new and unequivocal,” replied Aylwin. “The governor of Michigan territory is now at Washington, and daily closeted with the secretary of war. It is whispered that they are laying their heads together to plan a campaign against Upper Canada.” “Do you believe these whispers, Aylwin, or are you merely jesting? “So far am I from jesting on this subject, that one object of my journey to Norfolk is to give you timely notice, in order that you may petition for a transfer, and join the little army Hull is about raising; for I know that you would wish to be actively engaged in the earliest operations against our enemy—that is to be.” “I owe you a thousand thanks, my dear cousin,” replied George; “and I will instantly forward an application to the war department. The friendship which Eustis has ever professed for my father may induce him to serve his son.” “I have no doubt of it. But, once more and for the last time, adieu till evening.” For about a fortnight, the society of his cousin added much to the felicity of George, and proved a valuable acquisition to the little circle of his particular friends. But the pleasure resulting from such intercourse was limited to that period, for on the twenty-first day of April, Aylwin was summoned to Washington, obtained his warrant on the twenty-fourth, and immediately joined his frigate; and on the tenth of May George received orders which removed him far from those friends who had chosen a path to glory on the stormy main.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. CATHARINE AT HOME. What a rich feast the canker grief has made! How has it suck'd the roses of thy cheeks, And drank the liquid crystal of thine eyes! Sewel's Sir Walt. Rawl. When major Willoughby arrived at Mulberry-Grove, after obtaining a commission for his son at Washington, as recorded in the twenty-second chapter of this history, he lost no time in visiting his neighbor Fleming, who had arrived with his daughter only five days before him. An explanation immediately took place respecting every circumstance attending the catastrophe at Richmond, to the mutual astonishment of all parties. When Catharine learned that she did not owe her life to Sandford, but that she had been actually saved by the intrepidity of George, supported in his arms, and pressed to his bosom, her sensations overpowered her, and she fainted. She soon revived, however, and a few moments retreat to another apartment, supported by her mother, restored her recollection. Gratitude to her pretended preserver had hitherto sealed her lips respecting his villanous propositions; with her burning face hid in her mother's bosom, she now for the first time imparted the humiliating secret. Indignation for the affront, horror for the danger her daughter had incurred, and joy for her happy escape, almost reduced the mother to the state from which Catharine had just been recovered. It was imparted to Fleming and Willoughby—the one stamped with rage—the other returned thanks to Heaven for her deliverance. The general behaviour and particular anxiety of George at Richmond, had for the first time imparted to the mind of his father an idea which the reader has for some time entertained. But the major was unwilling to adopt it; for it was in direct opposition to his favorite doctrine, that “absence is the death of infant love.” It is true he admitted, what he knew from his own experience, that the seeds of a tender and lasting affection may be sown in childhood; but he believed that the seeds of vegetables could as easily spring up and grow without the presence of the sun, as those of love without the presence of its object. George and Catharine were scarcely past childhood when their separation took place. That separation had lasted almost two years, and was it possible, that her unfinished portrait had remained in his bosom unfaded? Or had imagination, during that period, been playing the artist, and brightening the delicate tints of infancy to the 18* full lustre of youthful beauty? At any rate, was it not evident, from present appearances, that George would never have occasion to sink under the preying despondency of a hopeless passion, if Catharine Fleming was its object? Such were the questions which arose in the mind of Willoughby as he walked back to the Grove, and although the responses of his heart were not in exact unison with the pre-conceived opinions of his head, yet, he determined to act, in one respect, as if the former were correct. He was ignorant of Sandford's former connexion with George, but thought it more than probable that the duties of their profession might one day bring them together. Were George to be made acquainted with the foregoing circumstances, unpleasant, if not fatal consequences might be produced. It was true that the mind of his son was strongly guarded against the suggestions of false honor; still, if he did really love Catharine, reason and religion might possibly (on the impulse of the moment) be both forgotten, and some disastrous event spread a circle of misery over the placid surface of their present destiny. He therefore merely informed George, by letter, that Fleming and his daughter had arrived home in safety, that Catharine was very grateful to George for his gallantry in saving her life at Richmond, and that the whole family longed for an opportunity to thank him in person. Catharine did indeed long for such an opportunity. For the first time she ventured to examine the real state of her heart, and ended with the conviction that she could bear, with comparative composure, any misfortune except the loss of that affection which she now more than ever believed was cherished for her in the bosom of George. His image, in the attitude of bidding her a silent adieu, had been ever present to her imagination, since their parting interview. The handkerchief with which he hastily arrested one truant drop that glittered on his cheek, was moist with her own tears. He had turned to “look adieu,” for he felt it impossible to articulate the word. Such was the picture on which her fancy had dwelt with growing fondness. It was that of a blooming boy; and she had almost regretted that his advance towards maturity would necessarily displace those softer graces by more manly endowments: she had felt that the slightest alteration in a single feature, would be a blemish in the lovely portrait, and mar, if not totally destroy, its identity. She loved the boy—she had never seen the man. But since the late eclaircissment the picture had been changed. A hero was now represented bearing her almost lifeless form from a scene of horror and destruction, at the imminent hazard of his own life. From motives truly disinterested and magnanimous, he had struggled with a devouring element, disdaining to shrink from personal danger while the life of a fellow-creature depended upon his courage and exertions. In vain a thousand tongues of fire demand his rescued victim—in vain the forked flames pursue him for their prey; he dashes undaunted through the sulphurous cloud, and bears his prize in triumph from the funeral pyre of Richmond's brightest hopes. To reward the perilous achievement, Heaven had directed his aid to one whose existence was dear to him—to one whose death would have inflicted a lasting wound in his bosom. His subsequent anxiety for an interview had been represented to her, and she now thought that life would be insupportable if a meeting with her preserver was much longer deferred. Many tardy weeks lingered as they passed, vivacity fled, health gradually declined, and the once blooming lively Catharine was but the pallid spectre of her former self. She sometimes resorted to the harp for relief, but her performances were too much in unison with the tone of her feelings, to impart cheerfulness to her mind; the “Parting of Friends,”[14] [14] The Irish Scarfuint na Gompanach. “Love in Secret,”† † The Irish Gradh gan fios. or some other air of a similar character, would rise unbidden from the sympathetic strings. “She touch'd the chords of joy, but low And mournful answer'd notes of wo.”† † Scott's Lady of the Lake. One circumstance that contributed not a little to the melancholy of Catharine, was the illness of her dear grandfather. During the long absence of his favorite, the poor old man had fretted himself incessantly; and the sudden impulse of joy with which he embraced her on her return, added to his terrors for the danger she had incurred, proved too powerful for his debilitated system; a raging fever, attended with frequent fits of delirium, now kept him confined to his bed. Catharine was his nurse, for in his lucid intervals he would receive assistance from no other hand; she watched continually by his pillow, except when her mother exhorted her with tears to regard her own declining health, and compelled her, at times, to relinquish the office to her parents. The tender assiduities of this affectionate family, with the excellent prescriptions of a skilful physician, were not entirely lost on O'Hara. His fever was broken, his mental faculties composed, and his strength so far restored, that in the course of a month he could walk across his chamber, supported by the arm of his attentive grand-daughter, and occasionally recreate himself on his harp. Catharine undoubtedly possessed the first place in the affections of O'Hara; but next to her he loved George Willoughby, his amiable and tractable pupil. The old man would speak of him in terms of approbation amounting to enthusiasm, and delighted to hear others mention his name. Catharine, who considered no task a hardship that could impart a ray of comfort to the afflicted heart of her poor sick grandfather, was never backward in discussing his favourite theme, the merits of master Willoughby. His heroic achievement on the lake when not ten years old, his accomplished manners, his generous disposition, his daring intrepidity, his acquirements in literature, his genius in poetry, and his skill in music, were subjects which never wearied the ear of O'Hara, nor fatigued the tongue of Catharine. She would lull him to repose with some song that George had written, and administered his nourishment in a cup which George had formed of a curious shell. The old man fretted continually at the long absence of his pupil—and so, perhaps, did Catharine. One circumstance, which occurred two years before, had tended not a little to endear the pupil to his tutor. On the seventeenth of March, the festival of Erin's tutelar saint, George requested O'Hara to perform some national air, appropriate to the occasion. The old harper refused, urging as a reason, the present degraded condition of his native country, and broke out into a torrent of invectives against the tyranny which held it in vassalage. Two days afterwards, at the conclusion of his musical exercises, George sung the following words to one of his tutor's favorite airs.— From that time forward, no power on earth could have convinced O'Hara that his pupil was not a prodigy. THE EXILED MINSTREL. “Friendless exile! old and hoary, Banish sorrow and complaint, Wake thy harp to Erin's glory, Sing the lay of Erin's saint.” 'Twas Saint Patrick's festal morning, When I met the man of grief; On his cheek the tear was burning— Wither'd was the shamrock leaf. “No,” exclaim'd the aged stranger, “Erin's glory is no more; Hordes of bloody tyrants range her, Freedom flies Hibernia's shore. “Shackled with the yoke of Britain, Doom'd to vassalage and chains, Be her name nor sung nor written, Till oppression fly her plains. “Bright she shines in ancient legends, When her sons awoke the lay, Ere her peaceful verdant regions Groan'd beneath Ambition's sway. “Ask me not to sing of glory, For, by all the griefs I bear, By these scatter'd locks so hoary, By our holy saint, I swear: “Erin's harp shall ever slumber, Never whisper through the vale, Never breathe a tuneful number Pregnant with dishonor's tale. “Fallen are the chiefs of Erin, Fallen in their country's cause; Green their tombs are now appearing, There her weeping daughters pause. “When the night-blast scours the mountains, When it murmurs through the groves, Mournful by the dusky fountains, Emmett's shade in sadness moves. “See! it points to curst oppression! Hark! it's shrieks arrest the gale! Hurl your thunders on aggression, Bid our warriors fill the vale. “Veterans, rouse! and save your nation! Hark! the trumpet calls to arms!” “Stranger! calm this perturbation, Here no martial trump alarms.” In his eye, where fire was beaming, Now appear'd the tear of grief; “No,” he sigh'd, “I was but dreaming, Erin groans without relief. “But I'll feed the fond reflection, Days of other months review, Call again to recollection Dear companions whom I knew. “Now opprest by power and vi'lence, Not a harp-string breathes a tone; Wrapt in sorrow, thought, and silence, Erin's hapless minstrels moan. “Sing of Erin's glory? madness! Would our Saint accept the lay? No—devote to silent sadness This our patron's festive day.” As the spring advanced, O'Hara's health continued to improve; and on the morning of the eleventh day of May, he accompanied his son-in-law in a pleasant ramble of nearly half a mile, during which he felt himself considerably revived by the refreshing breeze which fanned him from the lake. As they were returning, a man in a sailor's dress accosted Fleming, and requested some trifling assistance, to enable him to pursue his journey to the westward, he having walked all the way from Philadelphia, and expended the little money with which he set out. Fleming immediately conducted him to his house, and ordered breakfast to be prepared for the weary traveller. During his repast, the son of Neptune became communicative, and informed his hospitable entertainers that his name was Collins, and that he had for several years sailed in the merchant service from the port of Boston, which was his native place; but was afterwards impressed on board a British ship of war in the West-Indies, and for six years compelled to serve in his majesty's navy on different stations; and that he was finally transferred to the Macedonian, from which he effected his escape at Norfolk, by swimming from the frigate in the night. Three of his shipmates, equally anxious to breathe the invigorating air of liberty, were partners in this perilous attempt to escape from an unjust bondage— one of them only reached the shore with Collins. From Norfolk he had worked his passage, in a small coasting vessel, to Philadelphia, where he fortunately met a gentleman with whom he had been acquainted in Boston, who informed him that his parents were dead, and that his brother had purchased a farm in some part of Geauga county, in the state of Ohio, on which he now resided. This gentleman furnished him with a small sum of money, with which he commenced his journey in search of his brother. Fleming observed that his escape must have been a very hazardous undertaking. “It was so,” replied the sailor; “but we were willing to risk our lives for liberty. It was a great distance to swim in a dark night, and our poor shipmates must have sunk through fatigue. When we mustered on the shore, there was but two of us.” “Were your unfortunate shipmates both Americans?” “No, sir; but we had all been prest, and freedom is as sweet to an Englishman as to an American. There are now eight American sailors on board the Macedonian, who had agreed to come off with us, but their hearts failed them. Jack Card, Will Thompson, and Jack Wallis, backed out after they had got down the hawser. Tom Nowell, whom I left in Norfolk, was an Englishman; and one of the poor fellows that was drowned was an American, the other an Irishman, who had been prest in Belfast twelve years ago. I loved him like a brother—but `grieving's a folly,' as the song says. Poor Will and I have had many a hard pull together.” “Belfast!—twelve years ago!” exclaimed Mrs. Fleming; “his name?” “O'Hara.” “O my poor brother William!” The old harper uttered a dreadful groan, and fell lifeless on the floor. 19 The scene which followed was distressing. The females were distracted, Fleming bewildered, and the sailor astonished. O'Hara was the first object of attention; and Fleming, assisted by the sailor, raised him from the floor, and placed him on a bed; but he exhibited no tokens of life or sensation. The condition of Mrs. Fleming was little better; “Help my dear father!” “O my poor brother!” were the only expressions to which she could give utterance. The attention of Catharine was divided between her mother and grand-father, but the agitation of her spirits was so great that she afforded little assistance to either. The sailor did what he could, and lavished a thousand imprecations on his limbs and eyes for being the instrument of so much distress and confusion. But vain were all their attentions to the old harper—the sudden shock had been too violent for his feeble frame—his spirit had fled to a better world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. THE MEETING. The joys of meeting pay the pangs of absence, Else who could bear it? Rowe's Tam. A month had clapsed since the interment of O'Hara, and the family had in some measure recovered their cheerfulness, when an incident occurred by which their tranquility was again interrupted. It was Sunday, and they were, as usual, attending religious worship in the village of Cleveland, when about the middle of the service, every eye, (except a few more properly employed) was attracted by the entrance of two military officers in full dress, to whom several pew doors were thrown open, as they advanced up the principal aisle of the church. Although they entered one adjoining that of Fleming, Catharine neither saw nor heard them. Her external eyes were closed, and those of her mind lifted with humble reverence to her Heavenly Parent. Mentally accompanying the clergyman in his address to the throne of mercy, she poured out her pure soul in grateful thanksgiving for her creation, preservation, and all the blessings she enjoyed. A regiment at that moment might have marched into the church unperceived by Catharine. On resuming her seat, however, an unusual severity in her father's aspect caught her attention. Her eye anxiously followed his indignant gaze, and lighted on the image of—Sandford! I will not pretend that Catharine's devotion, pure and sincere as it was, had effectually guarded her mind against the effects of surprise; that is more than we have a right to expect from the weakness of humanity. The color forsook her cheek, and she clung to her mother for support. Alarmed at her daughter's indisposition, Mrs. Fleming led her from the pew, but had scarcely gained the aisle, when she fainted in her arms. Fleming flew to her assistance, and so did several females of her acquaintance. “Permit me, sir,” said Sandford, offering his aid, and starting with unaffected surprise on discovering whom he was addressing—whom he was supporting. The whole party left the church, followed by the other officer; when the transition to the open air immediately revived the lovely object of their solicitude; who, shuddering with terror, shrunk from the support of Sandford, and canght her father's arm. “Nay, my dear, do not be ungrateful—thank that gentleman for his gallantry—have you forgotten your generous preserver?” This was uttered by Fleming, in a tone of the most cutting irony. He then turned to the confused object of his sarcasm, and continued—“It really seems, captain Sandford, that you are sent by Heaven to protect my daughter on every critical emergency. Do me, sir, the honor to favour me with your address, that I may call on you to-morrow, and thank you as I ought.” Sandford was thunderstruck at this address; for the tone and manner of the speaker convinced him that some explanation had taken place not much to his advantage. He secretly wished himself a thousand miles off—or rather, he wished all the rest of the party at that distance, with the exception of Catharine. He was completely taken by surprise, and knew not what to say, or how to act; but at length stammered out something about a vessel that was on the point of sailing for Buffalo, in which he and his friend had engaged a passage, and awkwardly expressed his regret that his time was too limited to wait on Mr. Fleming. Then making a hasty bow, he seized the other officer by the arm, and hurried him out of sight, while Catharine was conducted by her parents to the house of an acquaintance, with whom they had promised to dine. The delicacy of Catharine's frame could not immediately surmount the shock it had received; she continued agitated and dejected during the intermission, and when the afternoon service was about to commence, expressed a desire to return home. Fleming, who readily assented to her wish, ordered the waggon to be brought up, and handed in the females, but declined accompanying them, as he preferred walking that distance in the cool hour of twilight, and wished also to attend the afternoon meeting. During the ride, both mother and daughter were silent and thoughtful; but very different were the subjects of their meditation. Catharine was reflecting on the similar effects of opposite causes. The sudden appearance of George instead of Sandford, would doubtless have imparted an agitation to her frame, equal to that which had lately overpowered it; but how different would have been her present sensations! Joy— rapture would have filled that bosom which was now laboring with sighs of sadness and regret. Mrs. Fleming had marked the indignant scorn of her husband's deportment towards Sandford, his subsequent thoughtfulness, and final determination to tarry at Cleveland the remainder of the day. These circumstances gave rise to many doubts and questions in her mind. He had never been remarkably exact in the performance of devotional exercises; why then did he, on the present occasion, express so particular a desire to attend to those duties? Might it not be his intention to seek another interview with Sandford? If so—she trembled for the consequences. This train of thinking was continued, until busy fancy had conjured up a thousand distressing fears for the safety of her husband. The more she reflected, the more plausible appeared the grounds on which her terrors were erected; until 19* her feelings became so powerfully affected, that she determined to end the dreadful suspense by returning immediately to Cleveland. Their habitation was now in full view, and separated from them only by a beautiful meadow, around which winded the carriage road, long and circuitous. Here Mrs. Fleming, assuming a composure to which her bosom was a stranger, first mentioned her intention of returning to the village. “It will be a long walk for your father,” said she to Catharine, “and I feel an inclination to repeat the ride. If you have no wish to accompany me, (and I would rather recommend repose) you may alight here, and walk to the house. The path is pleasant, and the cool shade will refresh you. If you find yourself sufficiently composed, assist Susan in preparing tea against our return.” Catharine alighted, and entered the meadow, while her mother ordered Thomas to drive back to Cleveland with as much expedition as possible. They arrived at the church door just as the congregation was dismissed; and Mrs. Fleming watched with trembling anxiety as they came out, but her husband met not her view. She now repaired to the house of her friend, who was not a little surprised at her unexpected return; but informed her that Fleming had accompanied her husband to church, and that she expected them back every moment. The fears of Mrs. Fleming were not entirely destitute of foundation. Her husband had been in search of Sandford, accompanied by his friend, and his determination was, to make a public exposure of his baseness, and then act as circumstances might dictate. Had they met, consequences of a serious nature might have been produced; for the least insolence on the part of Sandford would have insured that hero a sound cudgeling; and the other officer would probably have thought it his duty to interfere in behalf of his friend. But fortunately they did not meet. The packet in which the officers had embarked for Buffalo, sailed while Fleming was at dinner, and was nearly out of sight, when he finally ascertained that she contained the object of his pursuit. He therefore continued to stroll along the beach with his friend, until the declining sun warned them to return—when tranquility was again restored to the almost distracted bosom of his affectionate consort. In the mean time, Catharine found her little walk so agreeable, that she felt in no haste to terminate it. A row of sugar-maples on the margin of a pure rivulet, effectually screened her from the rays of the sun; birds were singing in the branches, and a thousand wild flowers scattered in her path. The refreshing breeze, at intervals, gently breathed upon her cheek, and wantoned with a profusion of ringlets, that hung below her black straw hat. But though the placid smile of nature had lulled into quiet the recent perturbation of her spirits, her reflections still flowed in a melancholy course, and were not inaptly represented by the sable habiliments of her person. She recalled to her recollection the time when that meadow was a thick grove, in which she had often strayed with George, and listened with delight to the music of his voice, or the fascinating tones of his harp. She recollected the particulars of their first interview, and his application to be come the pupil of her grandfather; his eagerness to receive his old tutor's instructions, and his patient assiduity in learning those airs which she had intimated were her particular favorites. His poor blind tutor was dead! Her dear grand-father, who loved her so tenderly, and for whom she felt all the affection of a daughter, would never more press her to his fond bosom, or receive pleasure from her dutiful attentions! His harp was forever silent, for the hand of its master was mouldering in the dust! Her feelings became enthusiastic, and she exclaimed aloud—“Sainted spirit of my dear grand-father! if it be possible for angels to remember those on earth who were once the objects of their love, look down in pity on your poor Catharine, and whisper peace to her disconsolate bosom!” A soft strain of music—more sweet—more seraphic than any that had ever met her ear, at that moment floated along on the delighted breeze. “Soft as the slumbering infant's sigh, “Sweet as the tear in Pity's eye.”[15] [15] Montgomery's Pillow. “Those silver sounds, so soft, so dear, “The listener held her breath to hear.”† † Scott's Lady of the Lake She was near the house, and the sounds evidently proceeded from thence. But what hand could produce them? She almost believed that the spirit of her grandfather was permitted in this manner to answer her ejaculation. She trembled, but not with terror; her sensations were undefinable. The music ceased, and Catharine timidly advanced; when through an open window a military uniform met her view, and the idea of Sandford shot like a bolt of ice through her trembling heart. While she was hesitating how to act, whether to retreat or advance, the door opened, and an officer darted towards her. Terror lent her wings, and she fled, but in a few moments found herself in the arms of George Washington Willoughby. “Catharine! my dear Catharine!” exclaimed he, “why do you fly me? Has the presence of George become hateful to you?” She reclined her head gently on his shoulder, and with a look of unutterable tenderness replied: “O no—O no! not you—Never would I fly from you. I thought it was—” She hesitated. “Whom, lovely creature?” “I was frightened at your sudden appearance. O George, you have been absent a great while!” “If Catharine thinks it long, then my return is blest,” replied George as he led her to a seat in a little rustic arbor covered with the full-blossomed bean, where after a tete a tete of three hours, they doubted that as many minutes had passed, so entirely were they occupied with mutual inquiries, replies, explanations, declarations, and confessions—assurances of affection and vows of eternal fidelity. It was not until they heard the waggon drive up to the house, that Catharine once recollected father, mother, Susan, or the tea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. DECLARATION OF WAR. How you awake the sleeping sword of War, We charge you in the name of God, take heed! For never two such nations did contend Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops Are every one a wo, a sore complaint, 'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the sword That makes such waste in brief mortality. Shakes. Henry V. On Monday, the first day of June, one thousand eight hundred and twelve, a confidential message was received, in both chambers of Congress, from the president of the United States, which was read with closed doors, and referred to a select committee by the senate, and to the committee of foreign relations by the house of representatives. Without the capitol walls, but one opinion prevailed respecting the character of this message—no one believed it to be pacific, but with respect to its influence on the members of the august body to whom it was addressed, many conjectures were afloat—different parties maintaining different opinions. In the mean time a very animated debate on the subject was supported within doors, under an injunction of secrecy. The message was indeed far from pacific. It recounted, in a manly style, the various, repeated, and continued aggressions of Great Britain, on the rights and interests of the United States, contrary to the known, established, and acknowledged laws of nations. It dwelt, in particular, on the subject of their impressing American seamen, and compelling them to serve in the British navy, and asserted that “thousands of American citizens, under the safeguard of public law and of their national flag, had been torn from their country, and from every thing dear to them; had been dragged on board ships of war of a foreign nation, and exposed, under the severities of their discipline, to be exiled to the most distant and deadly climes, to risk their lives in the battles of their oppressors, and to be the melancholy instruments of taking away those of their fellow-citizens.” This important document next adverted to the “violation of the rights and peace of the American coast by British cruizers, who had been in the practice of hovering over to harass departing commerce, and who had wantonly spilt American blood within the sanctuary of territorial jurisdiction.” Under pretended blockades, “without the pretence of an adequate force, and sometimes without the practicability of applying one, American commerce had been plundered in every sea, the great staples of the country cut off from their legitimate markets, and a destructive blow aimed at the agricultural and maritime interests of American citizens.” After animadverting at some length on the injustice of the orders in council, and the inhumanity of exciting the savages to hostilities, the message concluded with recommending to the early deliberation of both houses, this solemn question: “Whether the United States should continue passive under these progressive usurpations and accumulating wrongs; or opposing force to force in defence of their natural rights, should commit a just cause into the hands of the Almighty disposer of events?” The committee to whom this message was submitted in the house of representatives, made a long report on the Wednesday following, in which they travelled over the same ground of aggressions, usurpations, &amp;c. and ended by recommending an immediate appeal to arms. Mr. Calhoun, chairman of this committee, then presented a bill “declaring war between Great Britain and her dependencies, and the United States and their territories,” which was warmly opposed and obstinately debated in secret session, for two days, when it passed the house by a majority of thirty. It was then taken up in the senate, where it underwent a very enlarged discussion, and met with much opposition; but finally passed that body also, on the seventeenth of June, by a majority of six. Three different positions were assumed by the different opposers of this bill; one class attempting to prove its injustice, another its inutility, and a third its impolicy. The first of these maintained that the aggressions of England were not, in quality or extent, such as would justify an appeal to arms on the part of the United States; that the former had been compelled by imperious and peculiar circumstances to the obnoxious measures which were the subject of complaint; and that she was ever ready and willing to do the injured party ample justice, when those circumstances should cease to control her. The second class contended that, however justifiable might be a resort to the sword, the measure would fail in its object, and adduced many arguments to prove that the injuries complained of were not of such a nature as could be redressed by war in the then existing state of the world. A third party admitted that the aggressions of Great Britain were such as would justify a declaration of war against her, and that redress was attainable by such a measure, provided her adversary was sufficiently powerful to persevere in her claims, and maintain the contest with vigor. But the resources of the United States, they contended, were too limited for so vast an undertaking. A similar opinion is expressed by the dauphine of France, in Shakspeare's play of Henry V. “I well allow the occasion of our arms; But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the foe?” The bill declaring war received the signature of the president on the eighteenth of June, and was the next day publicly announced by the following proclamation: “By the President of the United States of America. “A PROCLAMATION. “Whereas the Congress of the United States, by virtue of the constituted authority vested in them, have decided by their act, bearing date the eighteenth day of the present month, that War exists between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and the dependencies thereof, and the United States of America and their territories: Now therefore I, James Madison, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the same to all whom it may concern: and I do especially enjoin on all persons holding offices, civil or military, under the authority of the United States, that they be vigilant and zealous in discharging the duties respectively incident thereto: 20 And I do moreover exhort all the good people of the United States, as they love their country; as they value the precious heritage derived from the virtue and valor of their fathers; as they feel the wrongs which have forced on them the last resort of injured nations; and as they consult the best means, under the blessings of Divine Providence, of abridging its calamities; that they exert themselves in preserving order, in promoting concord, in maintaining the authority and the efficacy of the laws, and in supporting and invigorating all the measures which may be adopted by the constituted authorities, for obtaining a speedy, a just, and an honorable peace. (L.S.) “In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents. “Done at the City of Washington, the nineteenth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and twelve, and of the Independence of the United States the thirty-sixth. (Signed) “JAMES MADISON. “By the President. (Signed) “JAMES MONROE.” In a few days after the publication of the above document, the members of the minority in congress, united in a long and animated address to their constituents, in which they entered their most solemn protest against the declaration of war. In this address they insisted, that “though the wrongs of which the United States had to complain were, in some respects, very grievous to their interests; and in many, humiliating to their feelings, yet these wrongs were of a nature which either would not justify war, or which, at that time, war would not remedy.” After using many arguments to prove the correctness of this position as it respected impressments, blockades, and orders in council, the addressers concluded by appealing more directly to those affections of the heart, which in their operation seldom wait for the sanction of the understanding. “How (asked they) shall a nation, like the United States, happy in its great local relations; removed from the bloody theatre of Europe; with a maritime border opening vast fields for enterprise; with territorial possessions exceeding every real want; its firesides safe; its altars undefiled; from invasion nothing to fear; from acquisition nothing to hope; how shall such a nation look to heaven for its smiles, while throwing away, as though they were worthless, all the blessings and joys which peace and such a distinguished lot include? With what prayers can it address the Most High, when it prepares to pour forth its youthful rage upon a neighboring people, from whose strength it has nothing to dread, from whose devastation it has nothing to gain? “If our ills were of a nature that war would remedy, if war would compensate any of our losses, or remove any of our complaints, there might be some alleviation of the suffering in the charm of the prospect. But how will war upon the land protect commerce upon the ocean? What balm has Canada for wounded honor? How are our mariners benefited by a war which exposes those who are free, without promising release to those who are impressed? “But it is said that war is demanded by honor. Is national honor a principle which thirsts after vengeance, and is appeased only by blood, which, trampling on the hopes of man, and spurning the law of God, untaught by what is past, and careless of what is to come, precipitates itself into any folly or madness to gratify a selfish vanity, or to satiate some unhallowed rage? If honor demands a war with England, what opiate lulls that honor to sleep over the wrongs done us by France?” &amp;c. To this address there were thirty-four signatures. Government had long been aware that, sooner or later, things must come to this issue, and had accordingly made such arrangements to meet the crisis as were within their power. It was necessary that a competent force should be stationed in the Michigan Territory, for the protection of the inhabitants against the incursions of the enemy, or for acting offensively, should policy require such a measure. For this purpose, the governor of that territory had been at Washington to consult with the secretary of war upon that subject, and had finally made arrangements for conducting a considerable force to Detroit. The name of this gentleman was Hull—whose military services during the revolutionary war are well known to his countrymen. He was born at Derby, in the state of Connecticut, and received his education in Yale college, where he graduated about the time that the American colonies first took up arms in opposition to the tyrannical usurpations of the mother country. He then entered the army as a volunteer, and served as aid-de-camp to the commander in chief in several eventful campaigns. He married a young lady of family and fortune, in Massachusetts, about the same time that major Willoughby led our hero's mother to the altar. He had been, for some time, governor of Michigan Territory, and was lately appointed a brigadier-general in the army. General Hull held an elevated place in the opinion of his fellow-citizens. In college he had been famed for his classical attainments, and ever since had ranked high as a scholar. He was uncle to captain Isaac Hull, of the frigate Constitution, on board of which Aylwin was sailing-master. Having made the necessary arrangements some time previous to the declaration of war, and digested a plan of the projected campaign, the general, with a few regular troops under his command, repaired to Dayton, a small town in the state of Ohio, situated near the mouth of Mad river, which is a branch of the Great Miami. Here he unfurled the standard of the “Northwestern Army,” and was soon joined by above twelve hundred volunteers from the adjacent towns, and most of those brave lads who had reaped a laurel harvest on the banks of the Wabash. With this force he took up his line of march towards Detroit, a well fortified town on the western bank of the strait which unites Lake St. Clair with the waters of Erie—separated only by a small river from the British territory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">20* CHAPTER XXVII. THE WHIP-HANDLE. When injur'd Virtue would redress obtain, Approving Justice will her cause defend; Her foe resorts to artifice in vain, The means he uses but defeat his end. Anon. In consequence of George's application to the War Department, he had received orders to report himself to the commanding officer at Fort Meigs, on or before the twenty-fifth day of June, and there join the Northwestern army in its march to Detroit; and, having sufficient time, he determined to take Mulberry-Grove in his route. He took leave of his Norfolk friends, at a convivial party, on the twentieth day of May, and repaired to Washington, where he tarried until the fourth of June, when he commenced his journey for the shores of Lake Erie. On the evening of that day, a rumor obtained currency, that the war bill had passed the house of representatives, in secret session, by a large majority. This rumor excited considerable sensation in Washington, and private expresses were hurrying off in various directions. One of these messengers stopped to change horses in Fredericktown, above forty miles from the seat of government, at the same inn where our hero was waiting supper, who instantly recognised the rider, having seen him frequently in Washington, and knew him to be an Englishman. As George intended to proceed nine miles further before he took lodgings for the night, he invited the stranger to bear him company, if he was travelling the same road; but the manner in which this invitation was declined, excited a suspicion in the mind of George that he was conveying to Canada some important information connected with the proceedings of Congress. In answer to George's inquiries, he acknowledged that he was travelling to Buffalo, but refused to communicate the object of his precipitate journey. Supper was now ready, and George invited the messenger to partake with him. He accepted a few hasty mouthfuls, and a bumper of wine; then seizing his whip, he mounted his horse, and galloped away. He had been gone but a few minutes, when our hero accidentally discovered that a strange riding whip occupied the spot on the table where he had laid his own, and naturally concluded that the messenger, in his haste, had inadvertently made the exchange. But George had no reason to lament the incident; for while he was amusing himself with cutting circles in the air, a silver tip, with which it was mounted, became unscrewed in his hand, disclosing a cavity in the handle, which contained a small roll of paper. He drew it forth, and found it to be a letter addressed to his excellency Isaac Brock, esq. governor of Upper Canada. Considering this document as a lawful prize captured from the enemy, George scrupled not to deposit it in his pocket-book. He then screwed on the tip, mounted his horse, and proceeded to Middleton, where he tarried until morning. The landlord of the inn being a magistrate, and a gentleman of respectable standing among his fellow citizens, George related to him the foregoing particulars, and requested his advice as to the manner in which the intercepted letter ought to be disposed of. “The present critical situation of the country,” replied the magistrate, “and the suspicious mode adopted for the conveyance of this letter, will, I think, justify us in examining its contents. If no grounds for detaining it should then appear, I will forward it to Buffalo by mail.” As our hero could advance no reasonable objection to this proposition, the seal was broken, and the following is a copy of the contents: “Washington City, June 4, 1812. “May it please your Excellency, “The plot thickens—war is inevitable— and the folly or madness of democracy fully established. The vassals of Bonaparte in the house of representatives, have agreed to enlist these States under the banners of the tyrant against England; there can be no doubt of the senate's concurrence—war will be declared in a few days —Detroit is the sally-port—look to Sandwich, and expect further particulars as soon as they transpire. Your ever faithful friend, X. “His Excellency Isaac Brock.” After some consultation on the subject, it was agreed that the magistrate, (who was to visit the seat of government in a few days) should take charge of this singular document, and deposit it in the War Office, for the inspection of the curious, where the writing might be recognised, and the traitorous author detected. Our hero, having first taken a copy of it, committed the original to the care of his landlord, and proceeded on his journey. His impatience to reach Mulberry-Grove allowed him no time to enjoy the beauties of the country through which he passed. He dined at Hager's Town, and slept at Messersburg, in Franklin county, Pennsylvania. The next day at noon he crossed the Juniata, a branch of the Susquehanna, running through a barren and mountainous country, and took lodgings at Bedford, sixteen miles beyond. On the fifth day of his journey, which was Monday, the eighth of June, he arrived at Pittsburg; reached Meadville on Wednesday, and entered Erie on Thursday evening. Here he exchanged his jaded steed for a fresh one; and after taking some refreshment, again pushed forward. For several miles the road was a beautiful turnpike, the evening cloudless, and the air freighted with sweets. At half past nine o'clock, the rising moon began to tip the landscapes with silver, and the joyous hum of a thousand little beings greeted her appearance. George now began to recognise sounds which had once been familiar to his ear. The scream of the owl, and the complaint of the whip-poorwill, were welcomed as the tones of friendship, for they reminded him of “times past,” and scenes most dear to his recollection. A pleasing train of images, led on by Memory, and decorated by Fancy with unreal attractions, passed in review before him. The queen of the groupe was Catharine. His own blood mounted, while that of his smoking steed dyed the rowel of his spurs. The impatience of his soul chided the dull motion of matter—he wished for the velocity of thought. At ten o'clock the next morning he crossed the Ashtabula, and took breakfast at a farm-house on the river bank. Here both horse and rider enjoyed a few hours of needful rest, and towards evening resumed their journey with invigorated spirits, The road now lay along the sandy margin of lake Erie; a natural turnpike, on which our hero's horse evinced the liveliest gratitude for the repose which his master had granted him. A little before midnight, they turned off through a clearing to a plantation, where George concluded to remain until morning. Though roused from their rest at this unseasonable hour, the farmer and his wife received the weary traveller with great cheerfulness, and entertained him with the best their house afforded. It was some time before he could convince them that he had been their guest before—they could trace no resemblance between the elegant soldier and the farmer's boy, although they recollected that the family of major Willoughby had stopped there for refreshment two years before. Early on Saturday morning he resumed his journey, and entered the village of Cleveland in the evening, about an hour after Sandford and his friend had arrived, who had travelled from Pittsburg by the way of Beaver, Canton, and Springfield, a much shorter route than that which George had taken. In less than an hour our hero embraced his father. On the following morning he was detained until a late hour in exchanging salutations with several of his old friends, who had heard of his arrival, and hastened to pay him their respects. At length, however, he stole out, and after dropping a tear of affection on the graves of his aunt and tutor, flew to the habitation of Catharine. The house was deserted, for Susan had taken that opportunity to visit a female friend in the neighborhood. He found his harp, however, and amused himself with playing, until he discovered Catharine approaching across the meadow.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVIII. LOVE AND PATRIOTISM. Love rais'd his noble thoughts to brave achievements; For love's the steel that strikes upon the flint, Gives coldness heat, exerts the hidden flame, And spreads the sparkles round to warm the world. Dryden. A short and happy week flitted rapidly away, and the day of separation again arrived. A fearful day to Catharine; for she felt that her newly-acquired felicity would depart with the source from which it emanated; and a void, still more dreadful than the former, be left in her bosom. It was the twenty-first of June—the day on which George was to bid adieu to Mulberry-Grove, and all the peaceful scenes around it. Their parting interview cannot be described, for no eye but Heaven's was permitted to witness it. Those bosoms which have never experienced the thrilling transports of reciprocal love, will feel no regret that I pass over the affecting scene in silence; while genuine lovers will duly appreciate that delicacy which forbids my intruding on its sanctity. In the awful hour of death, all disguise is discarded, and the real character of the man appears; Hypocrisy, alarmed, throws off her mask, and the heart resumes its long interrupted intercourse with the tongue and features. The effect of parting is similar, when two fond lovers are about separating for an indefinite time. Reserve is banished, the heart will be heard, and Virtue forgets to blush. One such parting interview is worth a month of wooing, for it will induce a tender confession, when nothing else can effect it; it removes all doubts, and displays the progress of affection in characters too legible to be misunderstood— “Hail, Separation! then, since it imparts “Such rapturous confidence to doubting hearts; “Delightful Parting! pledge of future bliss, “To thee I owe the long-protracted yes, “The unrestrain'd embrace, and voluntary kiss.” Major Willoughby accompanied his son as far as New-Salem, forty miles on his journey, where they found their old friend the missionary, their former fellow-traveller to Erie. He entertained them one night at his house, and showed them many curious Indian antiquities, which he had collected in his various peregrinations. The next morning our young soldier received his father's blessing, accompanied with much excellent advice, and a purse of fifty eagles, bequeathed him by his aunt. George drew his sword, and exclaimed, “Whatever be the fate of George Washington Willoughby, neither the weapon he wears, nor the name you have given him, shall ever be tarnished by his conduct; he swears to prove himself worthy of both, or perish.” So saying, he kissed the motto, and returned the blade to its scabbard; then embraced his father, shook hands with the missionary, and mounting his horse, hastened forward to join his brave countrymen in arms. He slept the next night at Sandusky, and in the afternoon following beheld the American standard waving on the walls of Fort Meigs; and within those walls he shortly after reposed. For several days our hero amused himself in exploring the surrounding country, and particularly the interesting theatre of Wayne's victory over the Indians. It would be difficult to portray his sensations on surveying the ground where his father's hand had mingled with its kindred dust, and where his own birth had been so mysteriously announced. Lost in thought, he remained for some time leaning against a tree, with his eyes fixed on the ground. From this reverie he was at length aroused by approaching footsteps; and on raising his eyes, the Mysterious Chief stood before him. His dress was like that which the friar's mantle covered at the masquerade; but the majesty of his deportment, and the dignified expression of his countenance, had given place to an air of dejection and melancholy—a shade of sorrow was visible on his brow. After a moment's silence, our astonished hero addressed him— “You see, mysterious being! that I have at length obeyed your summons. I am now in my country's service. May I hope for your approbation?” “You have it,” replied the chief; “but without me, your services will be vain.” “Will you then accompany me?” “I am always with you—for our souls are congenial; I shall always continue to be with you, unless you prohibit my approach by suffering your mind to descend from the orbit in which it now revolves, and in which I move. I am ever present with all who travel in the same circle; but with those in larger or smaller ones, I can hold no intercourse. Mars and Saturn can never revolve in the same orbit—their paths must ever remain distinct.” 21 “I do not understand you,” answered George, “your language, like yourself, is all a mystery.” “It is a mystery which you will one day clearly comprehend,” returned the chief. “But the invaders of Canada approach—you must join their standard; and whatever be the result of the expedition, do your duty, and leave the rest to Heaven. I will never desert you while you deserve my assistance. I have no access to your leader, or this campaign should end in glory.” “Why not to him, as easy as to me?” asked George. “When human philosophy can clearly explain the laws of attraction and repulsion, I will answer your question,” replied the chief. “But I shall not fail to assist and animate every one to whom I can approach. If such gain nothing else, they shall gain the approbation of their country. But to the object of my visit: While your country claims your services, she alone must possess your heart—to her your undivided affections must be devoted. Beware, then, how you suffer a rival to engross them. Patriotism must rise superior to all selfish considerations. When the Champions of Freedom have secured her temple from profanation, and when the dove shall again nestle with the eagle—then, and not till then, you may with honor yield to the gentle sway of virtuous love. But if you suffer any object to stand between you and duty, mark me—such object shall be removed. Your country claims you, and she must have you undivided—entire. Continue to deserve my friendship, by cherishing my counsels in your heart, and this high honor shall be your rich reward—your single arm shall defeat a host! Remember me!” On saying this, he walked deliberately away; and before George could frame a reply, or determine to follow him, he had turned a jutting eminence, and disappeared. In a moment George scaled the rocky summit, but could nowhere discover the object of his search; and stood for some minutes a motionless statue of wonder. The notes of a distant bugle, floating on the southern breeze, awoke him from his trance, and in a short time he could distinctly discern the waving banner and nodding plumes of an advancing host. He precipitately descended the eminence, and mounting his horse, soon met the van-guard of the Northwestern army.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIX. OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN. Now impious arms from every part resound: The peaceful peasant to the war is press'd; The fields lie fallow in inglorious rest. The plain no pasture to the flock affords; The crooked scythes are straighten'd into swords. Perfidious Mars long-plighted leagues divides, And o'er the wasted world in triumph rides. Dryd. Virg. The march of the army having been much retarded by the sick; and the greatest expedition being necessary to reach Detroit before the news of war should have subjected it to a siege, the general determined to embark all the invalids, baggage, and other incumbrances, and dispatch them by water, while he hastened on the army by land, a distance of about seventy miles. He accordingly chartered a boat and a schooner, which were brought up the river from the lake, and received their destined passengers and freight. These were ordered to sail in company, and departed from the Miami Rapids on Wednesday, the first day of July. In the night, however, they parted company, and at about ten o'clock the next day, as the schooner was passing Fort Malden, she was captured by the enemy, who had received a copy of the declaration of war, by express from Washington, a few days before. The boat was more fortunate; she passed the fort on Thursday evening by a different channel, and the next day arrived in safety at Detroit. By this unfortunate event, the army were deprived of all their hospital stores and much valuable public property, clothing, and baggage; while the commander in chief lost his instructions from the War Department, a plan of the projected campaign, and his commission; all of which fell into the hands of the captors, besides thirty prisoners, among whom were three ladies. The next day, however, two of the ladies were politely sent across to Detroit in a flag-boat, the other preferring to share the captivity of her husband. In the mean time, the army continued its march, and on Sunday evening encamped within three miles of Detroit. The citizens were very anxious for its arrival, the news of war having reached them several days before, and excited the greatest alarm for the safety of the place, there being only about one hundred regular troops to defend it in case of an attack. The hostile Indians were assembled in great numbers at Malden, where the sanguinary Tecumseh was impatiently waiting the signal to embrue his hatchet in American blood. Every moment increased the anxiety and alarm at Detroit, and every man capable of bearing arms was kept constantly on duty from Thursday until Sunday evening, (when the advancing army encamped in their vicinity) during which period no man slept except on his arms. The entrance of the army into Detroit was hailed as the harbinger of safety, and the watch-worn citizens once more reposed in peace and security. Preparations were immediately commenced for invading the enemy's territory, and with so much ardor were they prosecuted, that on the eleventh day of July the American standard was planted on British soil. The army crossed from Detroit to Sandwich, about two miles below, where they landed without much opposition. The general here issued a proclamation, calling on the inhabitants to remain neutral and quiet, and promising protection to their persons, property, and rights; at the same time warning them against taking part in the approaching contest, on the pain of being considered and treated as enemies. The effect of this address on the inhabitants of Sandwich, was a very friendly reception of the American army, which was the same day joined by above fifty of the Canadian militia, who voluntarily deserted the English standard. On Thursday, the sixteenth, the general ordered colonel Cass to take a detachment of two hundred and eighty men, and reconnoitre the advanced post of the enemy, whom he found occupying a bridge over the river Canas, about four miles from Malden. After examining their position, Cass left one company of riflemen concealed near the bridge, with orders to open their fire 21* as soon as the remainder of the detachment should appear on the opposite side of the river, in order to throw the enemy into confusion. The colonel then proceeded with the remainder of his force to a ford, five miles further up the river, where they crossed with some difficulty, and then commenced their march down the southern bank. About sunset they arrived within sight of the enemy, who were already formed, and prepared to meet their assailants. After the first discharge, however, the British retreated, and were driven about half a mile, when it became so dark, that the victors were obliged to relinquish the pursuit. In this little skirmish, ten of the enemy were wounded, three killed, and two taken prisoners. Our young ensign, who was attached to the fourth regiment of United States Infantry, had now, for the first time, seen hostile weapons opposed, and human blood flow. The consequence was, a perfect confidence in his own firmness and courage; a confidence which no one can fully possess until the extent of those qualities has been tested by a similar trial. All the operations of the invading army were, for a time, successful; and all opposition seemed to fall before it. The inhabitants seemed satisfied with the change of situation which appeared to be taking place; the Canadian militia were daily deserting to the American standard; and the whole country under the control of the army was claiming its protection. Had an immediate and vigorous attack been then made on Malden, it must have fallen an easy victory. But not a single cannon or mortar was on wheels, to carry before that place; and without such instruments of assault, an attack would be impracticable, and the attempt worse than fruitless. All furtheroperations of a hostile nature were therefore suspended, until gun-carriages could be constructed, and other preparations effected, for which purpose the greatest industry was exerted. In the mean time, an event occurred in the western territory, which materially affected the prospects of this little army. The important post of Fort Michilimackinac, commanded by lieutenant Hanks, was attacked by the combined British and Indians, and the garrison was compelled to surrender to above seven times their number. By this unfortunate event, the whole territory of Michigan became suddenly opened to the Northern Indians, who descended on that devoted country like swarms of locusts, and joined the British standard, in open hostility to the invading army—contrary to their most solemn assurances of remaining neutral. This numerous assemblage of savages, under the entire influence and immediate direction of the British commander, soon enabled him, not only to make a successful stand against the advance of the Americans, but also to surround them in such a manner, as to cut off all communication between Detroit and the United States, obstructing the only avenue by which the Northwestern army could expect succors and supplies from the country they were serving. To re-open this communication, the commander detached two hundred men, under major Van Horne, of the Ohio volunteers, with orders to cross Detroit river, and proceed as far towards Fort Meigs as the river Raisin, under the expectation that he would there meet captain Brush, with an hundred and fifty citizens of Ohio, who had volunteered to join the army, and were escorting a quantity of provisions for its use. In obeying these orders, Van Horne's detachment regained the American bank of Detroit river, and had proceeded southward as far as Brownstown, when a terrible discharge of musketry was suddenly opened upon them from an ambush, within fifty yards of the line. Four captains, one lieutenant, two ensigns, and ten privates, fell to rise no more; and a great number of others were dangerously wounded. Willoughby was slightly wounded in the arm, and his plume was shot from his hat. Notwithstanding all the exertions of the officers, the whole detachment retreated in disorder, and finally returned to camp without effecting their object. Under this sudden and unexpected change in his prospects, and despairing of an expected cooperation from the army on the Niagara river, the general determined to suspend his operations against Malden, and concentrate the main force of his army at Detroit. In pursuance of this resolution, and in opposition to the opinion and wishes of all the brave spirits who had embarked in this enterprise, the encampment was broken up in the night, and the army returned to Detroit, leaving to the mercy of the enemy many of the miserable Canadians who had openly advocated the cause of their invaders. Never had George heard an order which so much displeased him; and he burned with an inclination to dispute it. “Spirit of Washington!” he mentally exclaimed, as he witnessed the striking of the tents by torch-light; “why am I doomed to participate in this shameful flight from an inferior foe, and assist in this needless degradation of my country? Is it thus my golden dreams of glory are to evaporate in air? Were I but at the head of a regiment, or had the command of the brave Ohio volunteers, I would never obey an order that loads us with infamy!” “Remember my counsel!” uttered a voice familiar to his ear. He started, and beheld the Mysterious Chief at his side, who repeated— “Remember my counsel; whatever be the result of this expedition, do your duty, and leave the rest to Heaven. A soldier's duty, remember, is obedience. The day is approaching, when the stains of defeat will be wiped off by the hand of Victory. Let your conduct entitle you to participate in the glory of that day; for such participation depends on yourself alone. Continue to deserve my friendship, by cherishing my counsels in your heart, and your single arm shall yet defeat a host!” “Officers! to your posts—march!” was the order which interrupted this interview; George was about to reply to the singular address of the chief, but the darkness of the evening had shrouded him from his view; and he took his position in the line, which soon after began to file off towards the river; and before morning the whole army was encamped at Detroit, except a garrison of two hundred and fifty infantry, and a corps of artillerists, all under the command of major Denny, of the Ohio volunteers, who remained to protect a fortress which had been established on the bank of the river. Another attempt was then made to re-open the communication to the river Raisin, and protect the supplies which were expected under the escort of captain Brush; for which purpose a detachment of six hundred men was placed under the command of lieutenant-colonel Miller, and marched on this hazardous enterprise the same evening. At about four o'clock the next afternoon, the van-guard, commanded by captain Snelling, of the fourth United States' regiment, was fired on by an extensive line of British troops and Indians, at the lower part of the Maguago, about fourteen miles from Detroit. At this time the main body was marching in two columns, and captain Snelling maintained his position in a most gallant manner, under a very heavy fire, until the line was formed and advanced to the ground he occupied, when the whole, excepting the rear guard, was brought into action. The enemy were formed behind a temporary breast-work of logs, the Indians extending in a thick wood on their left. The gallant Miller immediately ordered the whole line to advance, and when within pistol shot of the enemy, to make a general discharge, and perform the rest with the bayonet. A scene now commenced, impossible to describe. The Americans contended with a force one third superior to their own. Five hundred Indians, almost entirely naked, horribly painted, hideously yelling and whooping, were fighting on almost every side, led on and encouraged by British regular troops. But the American troops did not disgrace themselves nor their country. They dealt out a full measure of death to the sanguinary wretches—they drove them, inch by inch, to the village of Brownstown, about two miles, when the enemy took to their boats, and the battle ended. The duration of the action was about two hours, without a moment's cessation. The Indians were commanded by Tecumseh, and, animated by his bravery, fought with great obstinacy during their retreat. The British were commanded by major Muir and both these commanders were wounded, besides several subordinates. The enemy had been on the ground several days, fortifying the place, by feeling large trees and sprang from their hiding places so suddenly upon the unsuspecting Americans, that eighteen of the latter were killed, and forty-five wounded. The actual loss of the enemy could not be ascertained by the victors, but was, undoubtedly, much greater than their own, as above forty Indians were left dead on the field, and many British prisoners were taken. Several young officers, among whom was ensign Willoughby, had requested permission to join this detachment as volunteers, and conducted themselves during the contest in a manner the most gallant and honorable, and were afterwards recommended to the general by colonel Miller, in terms of the most flattering approbation. Nothing, however, but honor, was acquired by this victory the communication being opened only so far as American beyonets could extend. The necessary care of the sick and the wounded, and a very severe storm of rain, rendered their return to camp indispensably necessary; and after remaining on the ground the following night, and part of the next day, they retraced their steps to Detroit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXX. THE CAPITULATION. On valor's side the odds of combat lie; The brave live glorious, or lamented die; The wreten who trembles in the field of fame. Meets death, or worse than death—eternal shame. Pope's Homer. After the battle of Maguago, and the return of the detachment without effecting the object of their expedition, the commander in chief became seriously alarmed for the fate of captain Brush, and the detention of those supplies on which the very existence of the army depended. An express was therefore immediately dispatched, with directions for him to take an upper route through the woods, and to reinforce his detachment with what militia he could collect in his neighborhood. On the tenth day of August, the enemy at Malden received a reinforcement of four hundred men, and the next day orders were given for the American garrison on the Canadian shore to evacuate their position, destroy the fortress, and return to Detroit. It was now whispered among the officers, that the general had stated that a capitulation of the army would be necessary! Though astonished beyond measure at this intimation, they were compelled to believe it; for it had reached them through a medium that admitted of no doubt. The commanding officers of three regiments, Miller, Cass, and M`Arthur, held a consultation on the subject, the result of which was, a determination to incur, (in the last resort) the responsibility of divesting the general of his command. On the same day they addressed a letter to the governor of Ohio, informing him of the state of affairs. On the thirteenth, the enemy took a position opposite Detroit, and began to throw up works. For two days they pursued their labors without interruption, and established a battery of considerable force. The American commander, “from the loop-holes of retreat,” beheld their progress, but gave no orders to drive them from the position they had taken. He appeared thoughtful and irresolute; giving orders one moment, and countermanding them the next: thus betraying a total deficiency in that requisite quality of a hero, which increases his firmness and confidence in proportion to the difficulties which assail them. Whispers of distrust and discontent were circulated among both officers and men; and the three confederated colonels consulted further on the plan of divesting their timid and irresolute general of a command which he was evidently incompetent to sustain. But this plan, which might, perhaps, have saved the army, town, and territory, and gloriously and successfully obtained the object of the expedition, was frustrated by an unexpected event. Two of this patriotic trio, M`Arthur and Cass, were ordered to proceed, by an upper route, towards the river Raisin, with a detachment of four hundred men, to meet the escort and supplies under captain Brush, and accompany them to Detroit. They marched on this expedition about sun-set on Friday evening, and on Saturday, at one o'clock, a flag of truce crossed the river from Sandwich, bearing a summons from general Brock for the surrender of the fort and town of Detroit; stating that he could no longer restrain 22 the fury of the savages. To this demand an immediate and spirited refusal was returned, and, soon after, the batteries of the enemy were opened on the fort and town, on which they continued to play until evening, when all the British ships of war came up the river, and anchored opposite the town. In the mean time an express, strongly escorted, had been sent after M`Arthur and Cass, with orders for them to return immediately. These orders overtook the detachment about dark, and were promptly obeyed. At day-light, on Sunday morning, the firing on both sides recommenced, and about the same time the English began to cross the river and land at the Springwells, three miles below Detroit, under cover of the fire from their shipping. They then took up their line of march, moving in a close column of platoons, twelve in front, upon the bank of the river. At this time the American fort began to be much thronged with women and children, and the old and decrepit people of the town and country, who flew thither for protection from the enemy's batteries and the anticipated barbarities of the savages. The enemy continued to advance, and the Americans were well prepared to receive them. The fourth regiment was stationed in the fort; the Ohio volunteers and a part of the Michigan militia behind some pickets, in a situation in which the whole flank of the enemy would have been exposed. The residue of the Michigan militia were in the upper part of the town to resist the incursions of the savages. Two twenty-four pounders loaded with grape-shot, were posted on a commanding eminence, ready to sweep the advancing column; and the American troops, in the eager expectation of victory, awaited in impatient silence the approach of the enemy. Not a discontent broke upon the ear—not a look of cowardice met the eye. Every man expected a proud day for his country, and each was anxious that his individual exertion should contribute to the general result. When the head of the advancing column arrived within about five hundred yards of the American line, orders were given by general Hull for the whole to retreat to the fort, and for the twenty-four pounders not to open upon the enemy. One universal burst of indignation was apparent upon the receipt of this order. Those whose conviction was the deliberate result of a dispassionate examination of passing events, saw the folly and impropriety of crowding eleven hundred men into a little work, which three hundred men could fully man, and into which the shot and shells of the enemy were incessantly falling. The fort was in this manner filled; the men were directed to stack their arms, and scarcely was an opportunity afforded of moving. Shortly after a white flag was hung out upon the walls, and a British officer rode up to inquire the cause, when a communication passed between the commanding generals, which ended in the capitulation of the whole American army, fort, town and territory. In entering into this capitulation, the general took counsel of his own feelings only. Not an officer was consulted, and no one anticipated a surrender, till he saw the white flag displayed. Even the women were indignant at so shameful a degradation of the American character, and all felt as they should have felt, but he who held in his hands the reins of authority.[16] [16] See Cass's letter to the Secretary of War. About ten o'clock the returning detachment arrived within sight of Detroit, and had a firing been heard, or any resistance visible, they would have immediately advanced and attacked the rear of the enemy. The situation in which this detachment was placed, although the result of accident, was the best for annoying the enemy, and cutting off his retreat, that could have been selected. With his raw troops enclosed between two fires, and no hopes of succor, it is hazarding little to say, that very few would have escaped. But Hull capitulated, and the American army became prisoners of war, without being suffered to raise a weapon in their own defence. Both privates and officers now ventured to express their indignant feelings without restraint; the former venting their displeasure in oaths and tears, while many of the latter tore the epaulets from their shoulders, and broke their own swords for vexation. What a sight was here for an American! As brave a little army as ever faced a foe, flushed with the hope of victory, and eagerly awaiting the approaching contest, were suddenly deprived of the laurels almost within their grasp, and obliged tamely to pass in review before an enemy, as inferior in the quality as in the number of his forces. Dispirited, hopeless, and desponding, they submitted to their humiliating fate with the best grace they could; though half of them shed tears because they had not been permitted to meet their country's foe, and to fight their country's battles. I will conclude this humiliating chapter with an extract from a letter which ensign Willoughby wrote to his father, immediately after the capitulation. EXTRACT. “To be taken prisoner, is an occurrence so frequent in war, that I think nothing of it; but to be given away to an inferior enemy—to be compelled to submit without a trial of strength, is almost insupportable. The enemy invited us to meet him in the field, and it was our duty and interest to fight. If we had been defeated in battle, a capitulation might not have been dishonorable, as it now undoubtedly is. I had rather a thousand times have fallen on the bloody field, far from my friends and paternal home, than to return thither, as I shortly must, covered with disgrace. “I know not exactly what the articles of this disgraceful capitulation are; but it is understood among us that the volunteers of our state, and the militia of Michigan, are to return home on parole. The regular troops, (many of whom were heroes on the Wabash) are surrendered as prisoners of war. All the public property at this place is given up, together with the brig Adams, lately repairing here. Cass and M`Arthur, who had been sent off with a detachment to open a communication with the river Raisin, by a different route from that of Brownstown, and who were returning to Detroit, were included in the surrender! Captain Brush, from Ohio, who was at the river Raisin, on his march to Detroit with a volunteer company, escorting thirteen hundred head of cattle, and one hundred and fifty barrels of flour, for the use of the army, was also included 22* in the surrender! A son of colonel Elliott, British Indian agent, was dispatched to the river Raisin, to apprise Brush of the terms of the capitulation, who being a noble fellow, refused, and took young Elliott about thirty miles in his retreat, and then let him return to Detroit. Brush, it is expected, will escape back to Ohio; for should they pursue him, he will have one hundred miles start of the enemy. “The Ohio volunteers are to be landed at Cleveland, and one of them has promised to call at Mulberry-Grove with this letter. I need not desire you to use him well. If I can obtain a parole, I shall soon embrace you; if not, God only knows when I shall see you again. We shall sail on Wednesday for Fort Erie. Adieu.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXI. THE ANTIDOTE. “Fame flies before, the messenger of Jove, “And shining soars, and claps her wings above.' Pope's Homer. While these unfortunate events were transpiring at the west end of lake Erie, the Champions of Freedom had unfurled her standard near its eastern borders, on the river Niagara. Detachments of regular troops and volunteers were almost daily arriving at this encampment from all parts of the country, and a formidable force was soon collected, under the command of general Smyth, besides a large body of New-York militia, commanded by general Van Rensselaer. Arrangements were likewise making, with the greatest activity, to establish on each of the lakes a naval force, sufficiently powerful to cope with that of the enemy. To effect this purpose on lake Ontario, Sacket's Harbor was protected by fortifications, and the construction and establishment of a respectable lake fleet immediately commenced, under the superintendence and direction of commodore Chauncey. At Ogdensburg, east-ward of lake Ontario, on the river St. Lawrence, was stationed a detachment of militia, under the command of brigadier-general Brown, who had been lately promoted by the governor of New-York, and by him entrusted with the general care of the northern frontier of that state; the most important points of which were, by his exertions, soon placed in a respectable state of defence. At Plattsburgh, also, on lake Champlain, great exertions were making to establish a formidable force under general Bloomfield; and a small naval establishment was, at the same time, erecting on the lake, for the purpose of co-operating with, and facilitating military operations, and preventing the enemy from receiving those supplies which treason might find agents to procure. A spirit of patriotism pervaded the whole country, not excepting those who were opposed to the declaration of war. Volunteer corps were raising in almost every town; private donations of money and clothing for the army were immense; and several gentlemen of high standing, among whom were members of legislative bodies, [17] [17] The following is an extract of a letter from a recruiting officer to his friend in New-Hampshire: “The patriotic William C. Belding, (late representative of the town of Swanzy) has enlisted in the army of the United States, at Keene, where I have a rendezvous open, which promises success. I have only to add, that Mr. Belding is a man of independent circumstances, and in whom even his political enemies cannot find a blemish. “Respectfully, yours, “JAMES WELLS.” cheerfully shouldered the musket, and marched at the word of command. Numerous corps of exempts were also organized, and all were animated with a desire of restoring the lustre of their country's tarnished honor, and were eager to risk their lives in the cause of injured Freedom. In the mean time, the unfortunate victims of Hull's timidity were sighing in captivity and inglorious indolence. The most of them had been taken to Fort Erie, and from thence to Quebec. Ensign Willoughby, with thirty others, officers and privates, were detained on board the late American brig Adams, which was now attached to the British naval force on the lake, and called the Detroit. For many lingering weeks were they confined to this floating prison, more than once in sight of that shore where rested our hero's dearest hopes. At length, however, as the autumn advanced, arrangements were made for sending these prisoners also to Quebec; and the Detroit was ordered to proceed to Fort Erie, and there land them for that purpose. In pursuance of this order, she set sail, in company with the brig Caledonia, which was loaded with furs; and on the morning of the eighth day of October, both vessels were anchored under the guns of that fortress. They were soon afterwards boarded by an officer who took an account of the prisoners, and made arrangements for their being landed in the course of the following day. When the name of Willoughby was read from the roll, the officer took a packet from his pocket, and presented it to George, informing him that it had been brought from Buffalo, two days before, by his son, who had been made a prisoner by the Americans and paroled. “I feel happy,” added he with a smile, “in believing that the duty of a British officer and that of a Christian are not altogether incompatible: the former compelled me to break that seal—the latter forbids me to forget that I am a father, and have had a son in captivity.” Our hero made a suitable reply, and having, at one glance, recognised his father's writing, eagerly retired to feast on the contents, and read as follows: “Mulberry-Grove, Ohio, Sept. 24, 1812. “I have, my brave but unfortunate boy, written several letters, and directed them to you at different military posts in Canada; but know not whether either of them has been fortunate enough to reach you. Mr. Fleming, who departs for Buffalo to-morrow morning, expects to meet a young Irish prisoner there, to whom he can safely confide this letter—he being the son of Fleming's particular friend. “The conduct of your late commander is universally condemned on this side the lines, and is, I have no doubt, the theme of ridicule on the other side. But this will afford no consolation to a generous mind; it will rather be an addition to the pains of captivity, to reflect that our country gains neither honor nor profit by our misfortunes. “But do not despond. A brighter day shall dissipate these clouds, and bid our drooping laurels revive. Remember, that —“In struggling with misfortunes, Lies the proof of virtue;” and that the order of Providence is such, that real good is often the result of apparent evil; even the misfortune which we now lament, may yet prove a real and lasting benefit to our country. Perhaps we are already indebted to it for the patriotic flame which is now blazing from Georgia to Maine—from the Illinois to the Atlantic coast. Every revolving day—almost every passing hour, is fraught with intelligence that inspires me with the ardor of youth; and I glory in the conviction that my young countrymen are worthy of their patriotic sires. Let this reflection console you in captivity, and banish unavailing regret from your bosom. Bear up with manly fortitude against the hardships of your present state, and look forward with hope to the future. By bearing misfortunes well, we acquire that elevation of soul which teaches us to despise them. —“In adversity “The mind grows strong by buffeting the tempest; “But, in success dissolving, sinks to ease, “And loses all her firmness.” “A more fortunate destiny awaited your cousin Aylwin; and Hull on the ocean has more than redeemed what was lost by Hull on the land. On the very day that your general sailed a captive from Detroit, his nephew on the ocean covered the name of Hull with imperishable glory, and dissolved the charm on which the vaunted omnipotence of Britain depended. The very hour that beheld you a desponding captive, heaped on your cousin Aylwin a full measure of fame. “You may, perhaps, have heard of the glorious event to which I allude, although your situation may have prevented your learning the particulars. I know not if you are permitted to read newspapers, or have an opportunity of seeing those published in the United States. All that they have yet contained relative to this event, formed the subject of my last letter: what I shall now communicate, is the substance of one which I this morning received from your brother-in-law Morse, and which contains, besides, the most pleasing assurances of your sister's health and happiness, and the general welfare of all your friends and relatives in that metropolis. These particulars may be depended upon as correct, they having been communicated to Morse by Aylwin himself, who arrived at Boston on the thirty-first day of last month. “Presuming that you have heard nothing of your cousin since he left you at Norfolk, to join his frigate at Annapolis, I will commence my brief narrative at the time of his sailing on his first cruise, which was on the twelfth day of July. “The Constitution had been but four days at sea, when, near Cape May, she fell close in with a whole British squadron, consisting of one ship of the line, four frigates, a brig, and a schooner; the nearest frigate within gun-shot. It was a dead calm, and the only headway to be made was by towing. The English attached all their boats to two frigates, and, by hard rowing, gained fast on the Constitution, so as to bring some of their bow guns to bear on her. In this situation they continued all day, the Constitution occasionally firing her stern chasers; and it was not until the next morning that a light breeze enabled her to escape from an enemy so much superior in force as to render a contest desperate. The whole chase lasted sixty hours, and during all that time the gallant crew of the Constitution remained at their stations without a murmur. “Aylwin, on this occasion, as sailing-master, availed himself of his station to evince his superior seamanship, and received the highest encomiums from his commander, for the judicious management of the Constitution; nay, it has since been ascertained, that the English commanders themselves expressed the greatest admiration of the skill displayed in the manœuvring and final escape of the American frigate. One of them actually threatened to hang his own sailing-master to the yard-arm if he did not lay his ship along-side the Constitution; swearing that the opportunity was worth a knighthood to him. “On arriving in port, after effecting this escape, Aylwin wrote me a letter, in which he gave a modest relation of the foregoing circumstances, and expressed his confidence of the ultimate success of our little navy. “I feel,” says he, “all possible conviction, and I can well judge from having been in the British navy, that they have not a single frigate of equal force with the Constitution, but what must, if we fall in with her and go fairly at it, strike her colors. Thank Heaven, in this chase, we had no occasion to be brought to the test; but there was not a countenance on board that displayed any thing like yielding without an heroic struggle. There seemed to be a solemn gloom in each visage, as if sensible of such a too early misfortune, yet combined with a cast of desperate resolution. It is not seldom that I have examined the human face in the hour of battle; and I never before saw a truer stamp of courage than was then to be found in every sailor's countenance.” He then adds, that (being in haste) this account is an exact duplicate of one he had just written to a particular friend—probably to yourself. “On the fifteenth of August, the day before your general's unfortunate capitulation, captain Hull again put to sea, and in four days after (for it seems that this ship cannot be a longer period on the ocean without encountering some important event) fell in with the Guerriere, an English frigate, mounting forty-nine carriage guns, and manned with above three hundred men. After exchanging some long shot by way of compliment, (to use your cousin's expression) the two ships engaged in a close and obstinate contest for ten minutes, when the mizen-mast of the Guerriere was shot away by the board; and in ten minutes more, his bowsprit was in the mizzen chains of the Constitution. Our brave tars made immediate preparations to board, but her two other masts falling at that moment, it was thought unnecessary. In fifteen minutes from the commencement of close action, the enemy fired his lee gun, in token of submission. “Captain Dacres, who commanded the Guerriere, was wounded in the action; and besides losing so fine a ship, had fifteen of his brave associates killed in the battle, and sixty-four wounded. In addition to this, upwards of twenty, who were stationed in the tops, were carried overboard with the masts. On board of the Constitution there were but seven killed, and as many more wounded. The Guerriere was so completely riddled, that captain Hull thought it best to set her on fire, after removing the prisoners, and blow her up. 23 “The number nineteen seems to have been an unfortunate one for the Guerriere. On the nineteenth of July, six years since, she was captured from the French, by the English frigate Blanche, after a contest of forty-five minutes; and on the nineteenth of August last, she was sent to the bottom after a much shorter struggle. Captain Daeres is the son of the late admiral Dacres, and was made post captain in the year eighteen hundred and six. “Aylwin received a slight wound from a musket ball. The style in which he brought his ship into action, and the manner in which he manœuvred her throughout the battle, has procured him the applause of captain Hull and all on board. Since their return to port, he has been appointed an acting lieutenant, which is the second instance in our navy of promotion from the grade of sailing-master. “Now, if you envy your cousin Aylwin, I will not chide you; for I know that you are not susceptible of a wish to pluck a single leaf from his laurel chaplet, merely because your own brows are not yet decorated with one. Your turn will yet come—I know it will; and I do not flatter you in asserting that you earned a few sprigs at Maguago, where your conduct was highly approved by colonel Miller, who was pleased to say, in a letter to a friend of mine, that “ensign Willoughby would make a hero, worthy his gallant father.” “If all I have yet written is not a sufficient balm for your wounded spirits, I will again call your attention to the exhilirating theme of American patriotism, in instances of which your native state (for so you choose to call Ohio) stands unrivalled, though not alone. “About two thousand volunteers, completely armed and equipped, and furnished with thirty days' provisions, have mounted their war-horses, and are at Urbana, destined to protect our frontiers from savage barbarity, until relieved by the army now on their march thither. They are composed of the most respectable and useful citizens the state of Ohio can boast. Our quota of drafted militia are now organized, and will in a few days be ready to take the field, when Ohio will present, for the service of the nation, seven thousand as brave and hardy soldiers as ever pulled a trigger. A company is also organized in Cincinnatti, and completely armed, consisting of such citizens as are legally exempt from military duty on account of age, official situations, and invalidity, including ministers of the gospel of different denominations. Their object is the defence of the adjacent frontier in case of emergency. “Our neighbors in Kentucky are not much behind us. When the news of the fall of Detroit reached Lexington, instead of deploring the loss, the citizens immediately set about repairing it. An immense number of volunteers immediately came forward, among whom were several members of congress, and shouldered their muskets in their country's cause. Four hundred regulars, and eighteen hundred volunteers, have marched from that state to the general rendezvous at Urbana. They are (to use the language of my informant) “some of the best stuff in Kentucky”— they seem indignant at the late news, anxious to wipe off the stain from the American name; and all of them are eager and determined to march under the banner of Harrison, who has taken the command of the western army. Three complete regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and five hundred mounted riflemen, are also on their way to take the same route. Colonel James Smith, distinguished for his services during the Indian war and revolution; who was one of the Black Boys of the Sliding Hill expedition, in the state of Pennsylvania; and who is now eighty years of age, has gone to join the army under general Harrison. He has gone to fight the battles of his country; not by paper declarations, or oral wailings; no—the report of his gun is to give to the enemy the first warning of his injured feelings. The greatest enthusiasm prevails throughout the whole western country: almost every man has volunteered his services; and, if we may judge from appearances, it will not be long before these “back-woods-men” wipe away the stain upon the American arms, by the ignominious surrender of Detroit, and the whole Northwestern army. “The citizens of Albany, in the state of New-York, immediately on hearing of the surrender of general Hull, commenced a subscription for raising a regiment of volunteers. Very liberal subscriptions were made for the comfort and convenience of those who might offer their services. A regiment of volunteers is also raising in the city of Baltimore, and fifteen thousand dollars have already been subscribed for the purpose of furnishing the men with every thing necessary for their comfort. Fifteen hundred men are immediately to march from Virginia, to rendezvous at Point Pleasant, on the Ohio. The LADIES of Richmond volunteered their services to make tents, knapsacks, &amp;c. for the soldiers, and in a few days all things were ready. “In short, our newspapers are filled with instances of loyalty and zeal, which promise that the war will produce much heroism, and secure a final triumph over the enemy. Towns and districts are turning out hundreds and thousands of volunteers; citizens, exempted by age or otherwise from military duty, are forming themselves into corps, for defence of the country, committees of public safety, correspondence, &amp;c. Camps are forming near the Canada lines, for the purpose of invading that country. At or near Niagara there are at least four thousand troops, and large numbers at Greenbush: to both these stations considerable numbers are yet expected. The New-England people will, notwithstanding the insinuations to the contrary, do their duty; the people of Canada are discontented, oppressed, and sullenly silent; privateering increases with general and astonishing activity; warlike stores, ammunition, &amp;c. are forwarded to the different posts and depots in great quantities; and, to sum up all, the nation is rapidly assuming that armed attitude which leaves nothing to fear—every thing to hope. “One instance more of genuine patriotism, and I have done with that subject for the present. I know that it will please you, for the patriot is a particular friend of yours, the old gentleman who last winter performed an essential piece of service for you in Norfolk, and for whom you have so often expressed the warmest esteem and gratitude. It seems that he has been solicited by some of his children, who reside in the interior of Virginia, to remove higher up the country, in order 23* to be out of the reach of danger in case of invasion of the sea-board by the enemy. In his answer he thus expresses himself—“I feel none of those alarms which some of our citizens do, to induce me to move away and leave our houses behind us, instead of staying at home in order to be ready with our guns upon our shoulders, to turn out and protect our property. God forbid that I should be so base as to move off in time of danger, and leave others behind me to fight my country's cause. No! let me die an honorable death rather than give up one inch of ground to the enemies of my country. I may move, but I hope no faster than I am forced. I was once young, and am now near sixty, and never did I see a real friend to his country suffer; for the Lord will provide for them; so I have recommended old and young to stand ready, and dispute every inch of ground with the enemies of our country, and to despise every man, without respect to age, who shall move away, and expect others to do that duty which his country demands, and in which he ought to participate.” “I shall extend this letter to a mammoth size, at the rate I go on; I will therefore conclude with a brief narrative of a few “war events” that have transpired since “the conquest of Sandwich.” “On Sunday morning, the nineteenth of July last, the English sailors on lake Ontario, having a mind to divert themselves a little on the Sabbath, in what they thought a defenceless port, made an attack on Sacket's Harbor, not expecting, I presume, to find a single gun mounted at that place. “Early in the morning, an English squadron of five sail was discovered beating up for the harbor, consisting of the Royal George, carrying twenty-four guns; the Prince-Regent, of twenty-two; the Earl Moira, of twenty; the Seneca, of eighteen; and another whose name and force I have forgotten. The troops were immediately called to arms, and expresses sent to call in the neighboring detachments and volunteers, who arrived in the course of the day to the amount of nearly three thousand. Soon after sun-rise, the Prince-Regent brought to and captured the custom-house boat, about seven miles from the harbor, on her return from Gravelly Point. The boat's crew were liberated and set on shore, with a message to colonel Bellinger, the commandant at the Harbor, demanding the surrender of the brig Oneida, and the late British schooner Nelson, seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and fitting for a privateer; and declaring, that in case of a refusal to surrender the vessels, the squadron would burn the village, or lay the inhabitants under contribution. Soon after this, captain Woolsey left the harbor in the Oneida, and ran down within a league of the squadron; when he returned, and moored his vessel on a line with a battery which had been recently erected, with springs on his cables. Captain Woolsey being the most experienced engineer present, left the Oneida under the command of a lieutenant, and went on shore and took the command of a thirty-two pounder, mounted the day before on the battery, the other guns of which consisted of nine-pounders. “By this time, the enemy had arrived within gun-shot; the Royal George, as flag-ship, ahead; and firing was commenced from the thirty-two pounder. This was returned by the squadron, which stood off and on—and a brisk cannonading was reciprocally continued for more than two hours, all our guns being well manned and served—and it was plainly discovered that the Royal George and Prince Regent were much injured. At this time, as the flag-ship was wearing, to give another broadside, a ball from the thirty-two pounder was seen to strike and rake her completely; after which the squadron fired but a few guns, and bore away for Kingston—our brave citizens giving three hearty cheers, and greeting the ears of his majesty's faithful subjects with the well-remembered tune of Yankee Doodle from all the music at the post—not a man being hurt on our side. One of our shot carried away the fore-top-gallant-mast of the Prince Regent. “The officers, detached troops, volunteers, and citizens, universally displayed a degree of firmness, intrepidity, and patriotism, on the occasion, worthy the Champions of Freedom. “The action was maintained within point-blank shot. Most of the enemy's balls struck the rocks below the battery, and one thirty-two pound shot was picked up by our citizens, it having lodged near the breast-work. “Sacket's Harbor, however, has since been better fortified, and has become the naval depot of lake Ontario. Captain Chauncey, late commandant of the naval force in the harbor of New-York, has been appointed to create, equip, and man a considerable squadron on that lake, of which he is to have the command. “On the fifteenth of August last, the day before you became a prisoner. Fort Chicago, (commonly called Fort Dearborn) situated at the head of the Illinois, near lake Michigan, was evacuated by the American garrison, who were nearly all massacred, after leaving the fort, by the Indians, who were besieging it. This fort was commanded by captain Heald, who had, a few days before, received orders from general Hull to evacuate the post, and proceed with his corps to Detroit, after disposing of the public property as he should think best. But before he could leave the fort, he found himself compelled to capitulate with the savages who surrounded it; and the terms agreed to by both parties were, that the Indians should spare the lives of the garrison, who were to have as much of the arms, ammunition, provisions, &amp;c. as they could carry away. Captain Wells, who had come from Fort Wayne to conduct the garrison to that place, at night ordered a quantity of powder and balls to be thrown into the Chicago river, to prevent its falling into the hands of the Indians; which, when they discovered in the morning, so incensed them, that they fired upon the garrison about a mile from the fort, and a terrible slaughter ensued. Three women and nine children were among the slain; captain Wells had his breast cut open, and his heart roasted and eaten by the chiefs present. Captain Heald, the commandant of the garrison, and his lady, were both wounded; the former through both his thighs, and the latter by a rifle ball in her wrist, and another through the same arm. Their lives were saved by Mr. Burnet, a trader, who was among the Indians: he claimed them as friends, and offered to purchase their ransom. Captain Heald and his lady are now at St. Josephs, with Mr. Burnet. There were no British officers or troops in this engagement. “Fort Harrison, commanded by captain Taylor, was attacked on the night of the fourth instant, by a numerous body of Indians, who attempted to make a breach by firing the block-house; but by great exertions the fire was extinguished; and after a severe contest, which lasted the whole night, the Indians were dispersed, and relinquished the attack. There is every reason to believe that the fort has since been relieved, as a respectable force has been sent for that purpose. Captain Taylor has been brevetted a major for his gallant defence of the fort. “Fort Bellevue, on the Mississippi, was also attacked about the same time, and gallantly and successfully defended by lieutenants Hamilton and Vasques. “I will confess that I am not altogether without apprehensions for the safety of the settlers on the southern borders of Erie. The English are at present complete masters of the lake, and the movements of the savages on the Canadian side are suspicious, to say the least of them. The invitations and lures held out to the Indians on this side, and the removal into Canada of the Sandusky tribe, has excited considerable apprehensions, especially in the citizens of Erie. But I hope for the best. “My old friend and fellow-soldier, Dearborn, the hero of your temple-scene at Ellen's masquerade, who, you know, was last winter appointed a major-general in the army, has actually taken the field against his old enemies. If the English still remember Saratoga, the name of Dearborn will strike a panic in their hearts. I believe his head-quarters are at Albany. “Our friend Brown, the quaker, has been promoted from a colonel to a brigadier-general, and with about five hundred militia, is entrusted with the defence of Ogdensburgh, on the St. Lawrence. “Harrison, the hero of the Wabash, has been appointed a major-general, and, as I have before mentioned, has taken the command of the Northwestern army. By the last accounts from the westward, he was proceeding rapidly towards Fort Wayne, which was said to be besieged by the Indians; and vast numbers of volunteers were marching from different parts to reinforce him—so that it may be fairly calculated, that in a short time he will have ten thousand men under his command; men who are thirsting to redeem the tarnished honor of the American arms. If our western troops are properly furnished with provisions and the munitions of war, you may soon expect to hear of the American standard being again reared in Upper Canada, by a force which shall bear down all opposition. “General Bloomfield has a considerable force at Plattsburgh, on our northern frontier; and the continual marching of troops to reinforce him, seem to indicate an intention of making a descent upon Canada from that quarter. “The unfortunate inhabitants of Richmond have been again visited with a distressing calamity. On Wednesday, the sixteenth instant, the powder-mills were blown up with a most terrible explosion, and the mangled remains of fifteen unfortunate beings, employed in the buildings, were scattered in almost every direction—legs broken, sculls fractured, carcases almost cut in two, arms torn off, were scattered about in horrible profusion. One corpse was thrown a hundred yards, into the trunk of a tree; an arm and hand driven three or four hundred yards from the scene of wo. “While these events have been taking place on land, others of not less interest have occurred on the turbulent domains of Neptune. “On the twenty-third of June last, two days after leaving port, commodore Rodgers, in the frigate President, had a running fight with the English frigate Belvidere. In this affair, which lasted more than three hours, the Belvidere had two men killed, and twenty-two wounded, but finally escaped after lightening, by throwing overboard her boats, casks, spars, and, it is believed, some of her guns. “The President received a considerable number of shot in her sails and rigging, but was not materially injured. The chase was continued till midnight, when it was relinquished as hopeless, and the President hove to for the squadron to come up. Early in the chase, one of the President's chase-guns, on that side for a considerable time. The President had three killed and nineteen wounded, most of the latter slightly; of the wounded, sixteen were by the bursting of the gun. It was by the same gun commodore Rodgers had his leg fractured, but has recovered. “While I am on this subject, I cannot refrain from mentioning an instance of juvenile heroism in a young midshipman on board the President; who, though scarcely thirteen years of age, conducted himself, through the whole of this affair, like a veteran hero. A twenty-four pound shot from the Belvidere wounded him in the left hip, carried away his pistols and dirk, broke three of his ribs, and so shattered his arm as to render immediate amputation necessary; the whole of which he bore with the calmness of a stoic. The same shot killed three men, and wounded two others. Eight days afterwards a sail was descried, supposed to be an enemy; when, notwithstanding the severity of the youngster's wounds, he flew upon deck, and reported himself fit for duty, requesting that his name might be struck from the doctor's books; which request, however, was not complied with. His name is Nathaniel Lawrence Montgomery, cousin to captain James Lawrence, of the Hornet, and son of Dr. Thomas W. Montgomery, a physician of high standing in the city of New-York, who has three sons, all in the navy. What patriot would not be a father? One of his sons is a surgeon on board the Essex, captain Porter: and this reminds me of another event, which is the last I will trouble you with at this time. “On the thirteenth of August, his Britannic majesty's sloop of war Alert commenced an action with the Essex, and in eight minutes struck her colors, with seven feet water in her hold, and much cut to pieces, with three men wounded. “The Dey of Algiers has declared war against the United States; and here I close my budget of news. If its perusal will tend to lighten in the least the weight of “the captive's chain,” I shall think that the hour I have been writing has not been mispent. Heaven bless you, and restore you speedily to your country and friends. Farewell. E. W.”</field>

It is not seldom that I have examined the human face in the hour of battle; and I never before saw a truer stamp of courage than was then to be found in every sailor's countenance.” He then adds, that (being in haste) this account is an exact duplicate of one he had just written to a particular friend—probably to yourself. “On the fifteenth of August, the day before your general's unfortunate capitulation, captain Hull again put to sea, and in four days after (for it seems that this ship cannot be a longer period on the ocean without encountering some important event) fell in with the Guerriere, an English frigate, mounting forty-nine carriage guns, and manned with above three hundred men. After exchanging some long shot by way of compliment, (to use your cousin's expression) the two ships engaged in a close and obstinate contest for ten minutes, when the mizen-mast of the Guerriere was shot away by the board; and in ten minutes more, his bowsprit was in the mizzen chains of the Constitution. Our brave tars made immediate preparations to board, but her two other masts falling at that moment, it was thought unnecessary. In fifteen minutes from the commencement of close action, the enemy fired his lee gun, in token of submission. “Captain Dacres, who commanded the Guerriere, was wounded in the action; and besides losing so fine a ship, had fifteen of his brave associates killed in the battle, and sixty-four wounded. In addition to this, upwards of twenty, who were stationed in the tops, were carried overboard with the masts. On board of the Constitution there were but seven killed, and as many more wounded. The Guerriere was so completely riddled, that captain Hull thought it best to set her on fire, after removing the prisoners, and blow her up. 23 “The number nineteen seems to have been an unfortunate one for the Guerriere. On the nineteenth of July, six years since, she was captured from the French, by the English frigate Blanche, after a contest of forty-five minutes; and on the nineteenth of August last, she was sent to the bottom after a much shorter struggle. Captain Daeres is the son of the late admiral Dacres, and was made post captain in the year eighteen hundred and six. “Aylwin received a slight wound from a musket ball. The style in which he brought his ship into action, and the manner in which he manœuvred her throughout the battle, has procured him the applause of captain Hull and all on board. Since their return to port, he has been appointed an acting lieutenant, which is the second instance in our navy of promotion from the grade of sailing-master. “Now, if you envy your cousin Aylwin, I will not chide you; for I know that you are not susceptible of a wish to pluck a single leaf from his laurel chaplet, merely because your own brows are not yet decorated with one. Your turn will yet come—I know it will; and I do not flatter you in asserting that you earned a few sprigs at Maguago, where your conduct was highly approved by colonel Miller, who was pleased to say, in a letter to a friend of mine, that “ensign Willoughby would make a hero, worthy his gallant father.” “If all I have yet written is not a sufficient balm for your wounded spirits, I will again call your attention to the exhilirating theme of American patriotism, in instances of which your native state (for so you choose to call Ohio) stands unrivalled, though not alone. “About two thousand volunteers, completely armed and equipped, and furnished with thirty days' provisions, have mounted their war-horses, and are at Urbana, destined to protect our frontiers from savage barbarity, until relieved by the army now on their march thither. They are composed of the most respectable and useful citizens the state of Ohio can boast. Our quota of drafted militia are now organized, and will in a few days be ready to take the field, when Ohio will present, for the service of the nation, seven thousand as brave and hardy soldiers as ever pulled a trigger. A company is also organized in Cincinnatti, and completely armed, consisting of such citizens as are legally exempt from military duty on account of age, official situations, and invalidity, including ministers of the gospel of different denominations. Their object is the defence of the adjacent frontier in case of emergency. “Our neighbors in Kentucky are not much behind us. When the news of the fall of Detroit reached Lexington, instead of deploring the loss, the citizens immediately set about repairing it. An immense number of volunteers immediately came forward, among whom were several members of congress, and shouldered their muskets in their country's cause. Four hundred regulars, and eighteen hundred volunteers, have marched from that state to the general rendezvous at Urbana. They are (to use the language of my informant) “some of the best stuff in Kentucky”— they seem indignant at the late news, anxious to wipe off the stain from the American name; and all of them are eager and determined to march under the banner of Harrison, who has taken the command of the western army. Three complete regiments of infantry, one regiment of cavalry, and five hundred mounted riflemen, are also on their way to take the same route. Colonel James Smith, distinguished for his services during the Indian war and revolution; who was one of the Black Boys of the Sliding Hill expedition, in the state of Pennsylvania; and who is now eighty years of age, has gone to join the army under general Harrison. He has gone to fight the battles of his country; not by paper declarations, or oral wailings; no—the report of his gun is to give to the enemy the first warning of his injured feelings. The greatest enthusiasm prevails throughout the whole western country: almost every man has volunteered his services; and, if we may judge from appearances, it will not be long before these “back-woods-men” wipe away the stain upon the American arms, by the ignominious surrender of Detroit, and the whole Northwestern army. “The citizens of Albany, in the state of New-York, immediately on hearing of the surrender of general Hull, commenced a subscription for raising a regiment of volunteers. Very liberal subscriptions were made for the comfort and convenience of those who might offer their services. A regiment of volunteers is also raising in the city of Baltimore, and fifteen thousand dollars have already been subscribed for the purpose of furnishing the men with every thing necessary for their comfort. Fifteen hundred men are immediately to march from Virginia, to rendezvous at Point Pleasant, on the Ohio. The LADIES of Richmond volunteered their services to make tents, knapsacks, &amp;c. for the soldiers, and in a few days all things were ready. “In short, our newspapers are filled with instances of loyalty and zeal, which promise that the war will produce much heroism, and secure a final triumph over the enemy. Towns and districts are turning out hundreds and thousands of volunteers; citizens, exempted by age or otherwise from military duty, are forming themselves into corps, for defence of the country, committees of public safety, correspondence, &amp;c. Camps are forming near the Canada lines, for the purpose of invading that country. At or near Niagara there are at least four thousand troops, and large numbers at Greenbush: to both these stations considerable numbers are yet expected. The New-England people will, notwithstanding the insinuations to the contrary, do their duty; the people of Canada are discontented, oppressed, and sullenly silent; privateering increases with general and astonishing activity; warlike stores, ammunition, &amp;c. are forwarded to the different posts and depots in great quantities; and, to sum up all, the nation is rapidly assuming that armed attitude which leaves nothing to fear—every thing to hope. “One instance more of genuine patriotism, and I have done with that subject for the present. I know that it will please you, for the patriot is a particular friend of yours, the old gentleman who last winter performed an essential piece of service for you in Norfolk, and for whom you have so often expressed the warmest esteem and gratitude. It seems that he has been solicited by some of his children, who reside in the interior of Virginia, to remove higher up the country, in order 23* to be out of the reach of danger in case of invasion of the sea-board by the enemy. In his answer he thus expresses himself—“I feel none of those alarms which some of our citizens do, to induce me to move away and leave our houses behind us, instead of staying at home in order to be ready with our guns upon our shoulders, to turn out and protect our property. God forbid that I should be so base as to move off in time of danger, and leave others behind me to fight my country's cause. No! let me die an honorable death rather than give up one inch of ground to the enemies of my country. I may move, but I hope no faster than I am forced. I was once young, and am now near sixty, and never did I see a real friend to his country suffer; for the Lord will provide for them; so I have recommended old and young to stand ready, and dispute every inch of ground with the enemies of our country, and to despise every man, without respect to age, who shall move away, and expect others to do that duty which his country demands, and in which he ought to participate.” “I shall extend this letter to a mammoth size, at the rate I go on; I will therefore conclude with a brief narrative of a few “war events” that have transpired since “the conquest of Sandwich.” “On Sunday morning, the nineteenth of July last, the English sailors on lake Ontario, having a mind to divert themselves a little on the Sabbath, in what they thought a defenceless port, made an attack on Sacket's Harbor, not expecting, I presume, to find a single gun mounted at that place. “Early in the morning, an English squadron of five sail was discovered beating up for the harbor, consisting of the Royal George, carrying twenty-four guns; the Prince-Regent, of twenty-two; the Earl Moira, of twenty; the Seneca, of eighteen; and another whose name and force I have forgotten. The troops were immediately called to arms, and expresses sent to call in the neighboring detachments and volunteers, who arrived in the course of the day to the amount of nearly three thousand. Soon after sun-rise, the Prince-Regent brought to and captured the custom-house boat, about seven miles from the harbor, on her return from Gravelly Point. The boat's crew were liberated and set on shore, with a message to colonel Bellinger, the commandant at the Harbor, demanding the surrender of the brig Oneida, and the late British schooner Nelson, seized for a breach of the revenue laws, and fitting for a privateer; and declaring, that in case of a refusal to surrender the vessels, the squadron would burn the village, or lay the inhabitants under contribution. Soon after this, captain Woolsey left the harbor in the Oneida, and ran down within a league of the squadron; when he returned, and moored his vessel on a line with a battery which had been recently erected, with springs on his cables. Captain Woolsey being the most experienced engineer present, left the Oneida under the command of a lieutenant, and went on shore and took the command of a thirty-two pounder, mounted the day before on the battery, the other guns of which consisted of nine-pounders. “By this time, the enemy had arrived within gun-shot; the Royal George, as flag-ship, ahead; and firing was commenced from the thirty-two pounder. This was returned by the squadron, which stood off and on—and a brisk cannonading was reciprocally continued for more than two hours, all our guns being well manned and served—and it was plainly discovered that the Royal George and Prince Regent were much injured. At this time, as the flag-ship was wearing, to give another broadside, a ball from the thirty-two pounder was seen to strike and rake her completely; after which the squadron fired but a few guns, and bore away for Kingston—our brave citizens giving three hearty cheers, and greeting the ears of his majesty's faithful subjects with the well-remembered tune of Yankee Doodle from all the music at the post—not a man being hurt on our side. One of our shot carried away the fore-top-gallant-mast of the Prince Regent. “The officers, detached troops, volunteers, and citizens, universally displayed a degree of firmness, intrepidity, and patriotism, on the occasion, worthy the Champions of Freedom. “The action was maintained within point-blank shot. Most of the enemy's balls struck the rocks below the battery, and one thirty-two pound shot was picked up by our citizens, it having lodged near the breast-work. “Sacket's Harbor, however, has since been better fortified, and has become the naval depot of lake Ontario. Captain Chauncey, late commandant of the naval force in the harbor of New-York, has been appointed to create, equip, and man a considerable squadron on that lake, of which he is to have the command. “On the fifteenth of August last, the day before you became a prisoner. Fort Chicago, (commonly called Fort Dearborn) situated at the head of the Illinois, near lake Michigan, was evacuated by the American garrison, who were nearly all massacred, after leaving the fort, by the Indians, who were besieging it. This fort was commanded by captain Heald, who had, a few days before, received orders from general Hull to evacuate the post, and proceed with his corps to Detroit, after disposing of the public property as he should think best. But before he could leave the fort, he found himself compelled to capitulate with the savages who surrounded it; and the terms agreed to by both parties were, that the Indians should spare the lives of the garrison, who were to have as much of the arms, ammunition, provisions, &amp;c. as they could carry away. Captain Wells, who had come from Fort Wayne to conduct the garrison to that place, at night ordered a quantity of powder and balls to be thrown into the Chicago river, to prevent its falling into the hands of the Indians; which, when they discovered in the morning, so incensed them, that they fired upon the garrison about a mile from the fort, and a terrible slaughter ensued. Three women and nine children were among the slain; captain Wells had his breast cut open, and his heart roasted and eaten by the chiefs present. Captain Heald, the commandant of the garrison, and his lady, were both wounded; the former through both his thighs, and the latter by a rifle ball in her wrist, and another through the same arm. Their lives were saved by Mr. Burnet, a trader, who was among the Indians: he claimed them as friends, and offered to purchase their ransom. Captain Heald and his lady are now at St. Josephs, with Mr. Burnet. There were no British officers or troops in this engagement. “Fort Harrison, commanded by captain Taylor, was attacked on the night of the fourth instant, by a numerous body of Indians, who attempted to make a breach by firing the block-house; but by great exertions the fire was extinguished; and after a severe contest, which lasted the whole night, the Indians were dispersed, and relinquished the attack. There is every reason to believe that the fort has since been relieved, as a respectable force has been sent for that purpose. Captain Taylor has been brevetted a major for his gallant defence of the fort. “Fort Bellevue, on the Mississippi, was also attacked about the same time, and gallantly and successfully defended by lieutenants Hamilton and Vasques. “I will confess that I am not altogether without apprehensions for the safety of the settlers on the southern borders of Erie. The English are at present complete masters of the lake, and the movements of the savages on the Canadian side are suspicious, to say the least of them. The invitations and lures held out to the Indians on this side, and the removal into Canada of the Sandusky tribe, has excited considerable apprehensions, especially in the citizens of Erie. But I hope for the best. “My old friend and fellow-soldier, Dearborn, the hero of your temple-scene at Ellen's masquerade, who, you know, was last winter appointed a major-general in the army, has actually taken the field against his old enemies. If the English still remember Saratoga, the name of Dearborn will strike a panic in their hearts. I believe his head-quarters are at Albany. “Our friend Brown, the quaker, has been promoted from a colonel to a brigadier-general, and with about five hundred militia, is entrusted with the defence of Ogdensburgh, on the St. Lawrence. “Harrison, the hero of the Wabash, has been appointed a major-general, and, as I have before mentioned, has taken the command of the Northwestern army. By the last accounts from the westward, he was proceeding rapidly towards Fort Wayne, which was said to be besieged by the Indians; and vast numbers of volunteers were marching from different parts to reinforce him—so that it may be fairly calculated, that in a short time he will have ten thousand men under his command; men who are thirsting to redeem the tarnished honor of the American arms. If our western troops are properly furnished with provisions and the munitions of war, you may soon expect to hear of the American standard being again reared in Upper Canada, by a force which shall bear down all opposition. “General Bloomfield has a considerable force at Plattsburgh, on our northern frontier; and the continual marching of troops to reinforce him, seem to indicate an intention of making a descent upon Canada from that quarter. “The unfortunate inhabitants of Richmond have been again visited with a distressing calamity. On Wednesday, the sixteenth instant, the powder-mills were blown up with a most terrible explosion, and the mangled remains of fifteen unfortunate beings, employed in the buildings, were scattered in almost every direction—legs broken, sculls fractured, carcases almost cut in two, arms torn off, were scattered about in horrible profusion. One corpse was thrown a hundred yards, into the trunk of a tree; an arm and hand driven three or four hundred yards from the scene of wo. “While these events have been taking place on land, others of not less interest have occurred on the turbulent domains of Neptune. “On the twenty-third of June last, two days after leaving port, commodore Rodgers, in the frigate President, had a running fight with the English frigate Belvidere. In this affair, which lasted more than three hours, the Belvidere had two men killed, and twenty-two wounded, but finally escaped after lightening, by throwing overboard her boats, casks, spars, and, it is believed, some of her guns. “The President received a considerable number of shot in her sails and rigging, but was not materially injured. The chase was continued till midnight, when it was relinquished as hopeless, and the President hove to for the squadron to come up. Early in the chase, one of the President's chase-guns, on that side for a considerable time. The President had three killed and nineteen wounded, most of the latter slightly; of the wounded, sixteen were by the bursting of the gun. It was by the same gun commodore Rodgers had his leg fractured, but has recovered. “While I am on this subject, I cannot refrain from mentioning an instance of juvenile heroism in a young midshipman on board the President; who, though scarcely thirteen years of age, conducted himself, through the whole of this affair, like a veteran hero. A twenty-four pound shot from the Belvidere wounded him in the left hip, carried away his pistols and dirk, broke three of his ribs, and so shattered his arm as to render immediate amputation necessary; the whole of which he bore with the calmness of a stoic. The same shot killed three men, and wounded two others. Eight days afterwards a sail was descried, supposed to be an enemy; when, notwithstanding the severity of the youngster's wounds, he flew upon deck, and reported himself fit for duty, requesting that his name might be struck from the doctor's books; which request, however, was not complied with. His name is Nathaniel Lawrence Montgomery, cousin to captain James Lawrence, of the Hornet, and son of Dr. Thomas W. Montgomery, a physician of high standing in the city of New-York, who has three sons, all in the navy. What patriot would not be a father? One of his sons is a surgeon on board the Essex, captain Porter: and this reminds me of another event, which is the last I will trouble you with at this time. “On the thirteenth of August, his Britannic majesty's sloop of war Alert commenced an action with the Essex, and in eight minutes struck her colors, with seven feet water in her hold, and much cut to pieces, with three men wounded. “The Dey of Algiers has declared war against the United States; and here I close my budget of news. If its perusal will tend to lighten in the least the weight of “the captive's chain,” I shall think that the hour I have been writing has not been mispent. Heaven bless you, and restore you speedily to your country and friends. Farewell. E. W.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">24 CHAPTER XXXII. THE EMANCIPATION. The darkest hour of sorrow's night Precedes the rosy dawn of light. Anon. In reading his father's letter, traversing the deck, and gazing wishfully at the American shore, our impatient hero lashed on the tardy hours. The shades of evening at length began to descend upon Niagara's dusky wave, and the eastern landscapes, browned by the breath of autumn, became gradually shrouded with a mantle of gloom. Still he lingered, to watch the distant lights, which, to his view, shone like the stars of Liberty, glittering from her favored shore, and marking the happy abodes of freemen. The tattoo's drowsy clamor aroused him from his reverie, and, with a deep sigh, he left his position, and directed his gaze to the westward. The moon was visible—a rayless crescent, slowly descending to the horizon—and but a few stars peeped through the scattered fragments of autumnal clouds. The wind sighed sadly through the rigging, while the rippling of the current against the vessel's prow, produced a melancholy response. It was not now a scene to cheer the drooping spirits of a captive soldier, and he left it to seek relief among the gay spirits assembled in the officers' ward-room; but found none, until he retired to his own birth, when he was visited by the drowsy god of slumber, who “sat on his eye-lids” until three hours past the “noon of night.” From a sweet dream of happiness, our hero was suddenly awakened by an unusual noise above him; in the next instant, the clash of arms and report of pistols roused every slumberer from his hammock, and the English sailors flew upon deck, where tumult and confusion appeared to reign for several minutes. Again all was still, and, in a moment after, the American prisoners were summoned, and informed that the vessel had changed masters; and that, if agreeable, the Englishmen would exchange situations with them, and occupy their births below. The sensations produced by this intelligence can be better conceived than described. In ten minutes from the first alarm, their former guards were all secured as prisoners, and the vessel under weigh. The Caledonia was also under sail, having suffered a simultaneous surprise. An attempt was first made by the captors, in both vessels, to stem the course of the river, and enter lake Erie; but that was soon found to be impracticable, owing to the rapidity of the current, and the lightness of the wind; orders were therefore given to alter their course, and run down the river. The morning now began to dawn, and the vessels were opposite the British batteries, in a river not a mile in width. They were obliged to pass these forts under a dreadful fire of round, grape, and canister, which was poured into them from heavy ordnance and light artillery. The Caledonia was fortunate enough to gain in safety the American shore, and anchored under one of the American batteries at Black Rock, effectually covered from the fire of the enemy; while the Detroit was compelled to cast anchor within four hundred yards of two batteries that were incessantly venting their blazing fury upon her. The commander of the Detroit hailed an officer of the flying artillery on shore, assuring him that if another gun was fired on the brig, he would bring the prisoners on deck, and expose them to the same fate that awaited the rest. This threat was, however, disregarded, and a destructive fire continued to assail them. The eyes of George were now, for the first time, directed to the young hero of this daring enterprise, but sought in vain to trace in his manly visage a disposition to put so barbarous a threat in execution. He looked again, and knew the countenance; it was the youth whose nuptials he had so unexpectedly attended, seven months before, in Virginia—it was the gallant Elliott. This was not a moment, however, for George to discover himself. All the guns had been brought on that side of the vessel which was next to the enemy, and the brave fellows stationed at them returned the fire of their enemies with interest, as long as their ammunition lasted. An attempt was then made to send a line to the American shore, by which the vessel might be drawn in; but not a breath of wind was stirring, and the current ran so rapidly that the boat could not reach the shore. Attempts, equally fruitless, were also made to send lines on board from the river bank. Almost every shot from the enemy took effect on this unfortunate vessel; her severed rigging dangled in strings, her canvas hung in ribbons, and every part of her hull that appeared above water, was disfigured with wounds. Elliott now ordered the cable to be cut, with an intention of drifting down the stream beyond the reach of the hostile batteries, and there making a stand against the flying artillery. A few light airs played over the river, and every piece of canvas not rendered entirely useless, was displayed to catch them. After drifting a few minutes, gradually nearing the eastern bank of the river, she struck on a sand-bar at the head of Squaw Island, and there grounded, still exposed to the British fire. Finding it impossible to get her off, Elliott reluctantly abandoned her; having previously sent ashore the prisoners. An active scene now ensued; the deserted vessel was immediately boarded by above forty English soldiers, who were nearly every one destroyed by a brisk fire now opened upon the brig from the American artillery, commanded by lieutenant-colonel Scott. Thus this contested prize lay between two hostile forts, exposed to the fire of both, and was soon unable to float; she was therefore set on fire by the Americans, and burnt to the water's edge. During this contest, the American army lost a very valuable officer, who was killed by a grape-shot from across the river, as he was approaching the beach on horseback. This was major Cuyler, aid to general Hall, a gentleman universally esteemed, and deservedly so; for he possessed that warmth of feeling which is the brightest ornament of valor; that spirit of liberality and frankness which is a virtue in every breast, but pre-eminently so in the bosom of a soldier. It was not until evening that George ventured to seek an interview with his brave friend and deliverer; and the pleasure resulting from it was a 24* rich compensation for all his recent misfortunes. At his earnest request, Elliott related to him those particulars relative to his unexpected emancipation from captivity, with which he was as yet necessarily unacquainted. “The command of lake Erie,” said he, “has been entrusted to me, for the present, with instructions to create and equip a squadron, as soon as possible, able to meet the whole naval force of the enemy. In pursuance of my orders, I have already purchased some vessels in the river for the use of government, but find myself much embarrassed with the difficulty of getting them up the Niagara into the lake. When the Detroit and Caledonia anchored yesterday under fort Erie, I instantly formed the resolution of boarding, and, if possible, obtaining possession of two such fine vessels; for though my instructions only extend to building and purchasing, I still conceive that capturing is by far the most expeditious and economical method of constructing a navy. “A body of brave tars were on their way to this place from New-York, destined for the lake service, and I heard that they were but a short distance off; I therefore dispatched an express to the officers, desiring them to use all possible expedition in getting on their men, as I had important service to perform. On their arrival, which was about twelve o'clock yesterday, I discovered that they were not furnished with either cutlasses or battleaxes, and had only about twenty pistols among them all. But on application to generals Smyth and Hall, of the regulars and militia, I was supplied with a few arms; and general Smyth was so good, on my request, as immediately to detach fifty men from the regulars, armed with muskets. “By four o'clock in the afternoon, I had my men selected, and stationed in two boats, which I had previously prepared for the purpose. With these boats, fifty men in each, and under circumstances very disadvantageous, the men having scarcely had time to refresh themselves after a fatiguing march of five hundred miles, we put off from the mouth of Buffalo creek, at one o'clock this morning, and at three were alongside the vessels. In the space of about ten minutes, we had the prisoners all secured, the topsails sheeted home, and the vessels under way. Unfortunately the wind was not sufficiently strong to get us up against a rapid current into the lake, where I had understood another armed vessel lay at anchor, and we were therefore obliged to run down the river by the forts. “In boarding the Detroit, one of my men was killed, and acting midshipman Cummins received a bayonet through his leg. For a few minutes, I was assailed by three powerful Englishmen, whom I kept at bay with my cutlass alone. The boat which boarded the other vessel was commanded by sailing-master Watts, who performed his duty in a masterly style. During the whole affair, only six Americans have been injured, one of whom is dead, and four others, I fear, are mortally wounded; an almost miraculous escape, considering our exposed situation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXXIII. A FRUITLESS CONTEST. And now both hosts their broken troops unite, In equal rank, and mix in mortal fight. They strike, they push, they throng the scanty space, Resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace, And where one falls another fills his place. Dryd. Virg. The active part which lieutenant-colonel Scott had taken in the foregoing events, his ardor in dislodging the enemy from the contested prize, and the readiness with which he afforded her the protection of his cannon, secured him the friendship of Elliott, and excited a peculiar interest in the breast of George to learn the history of so promising an officer. All the information, however, that he could acquire respecting the gallant subject of his curiosity, was, that he was born and educated in Virginia, where, for six years, he had been in the practice of the law, with flattering indications of success; that the attack upon the frigate Chesapeake, which kindled into a flame every young and active spirit of the nation, first roused him from the calm pursuits of peace, and induced him to accept a captaincy in a regiment of light artillery; that he had ever since prosecuted his military studies with unremitting ardor; that soon after the declaration of war, he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the second regiment of artillery, commanded by Izard; and that he had recently arrived on the Niagara with two companies of his regiment, which were posted at Black Rock, to protect the navy-yard. In the foregoing spirited little affair, he first `fleshed his maiden sword.' Like the hero of Sweden, he had heard the bullets whistle around him, and determined that from thenceforth that should be his music. A few days had elapsed since our hero's restoration to liberty, when he was informed that a secret expedition was on foot at Lewiston, the head-quarters of the Northern army, in which colonel Scott had been invited to participate. He therefore immediately applied for and obtained permission to serve in the projected enterprize; and by forced marches through mud, rain, and sleet, arrived at Lewiston, under the enterprizing Scott, early on Tuesday morning, the thirteenth of October. The successful gallantry of Elliott in recovering the two brigs, had excited in all the frontier troops a strong disposition to be actively employed. They had become weary of an indolent encampment; and hearing that their brethren in arms, on other stations, were almost daily reaping laurels in successful skirmishes, they wished for similar opportunities, and murmured against their commander for not giving them orders to act. General Van Rensselaer was not insensible to this disposition in the soldiers under his command; and he inferred from it that a crisis in the campaign was rapidly advancing, and that it was an object of immediate necessity to strike some bold and important blow, or consent to relinquish the objects for which so much toil and expense had been incurred. Under these impressions, he determined to make a descent upon Queenston, on the Canadian shore, dislodge the enemy from the heights, and gain possession of the village, where the troops might be sheltered from the inclemency of the approaching winter. At this time, there was at Lewiston about two thousand five hundred militia, raw and undisciplined, besides detachments of regulars, which had arrived from Fort Niagara, under lieutenant-colonels Fenwick and Chrystie, and major Mullany, to join in the expedition. Two columns, of three hundred men each, were to make a simultaneous descent on the British shore; one of them to be led by Chrystie, the other by colonel Van Rensselaer, who had the chief command of the expedition. As soon as the heights should be carried, Fenwick was to pass over with the light artillery, Mullany to follow with his detachment, and other troops to succeed in order. Such were the arrangements which had been made, when the gallant Scott, with his intrepid little division, arrived at Lewiston, at four o'clock in the morning. Finding no boats suitable for the transportation of artillery, he was obliged to restrain the ardor of his troops, and place them in battery on the American shore, where, at day-break, they opened a spirited fire, to clear the opposite bank while the landing was effected. All the boats which had been collected, were divided equally between the two advancing columns, but were insufficient to embark the whole at once, and were altogether inadequate to the service for which they had been collected. The movements of the Americans were soon discovered by the enemy, and a brisk fire of musketry was poured from the whole line of the Canada shore, and immediately after, three blazing batteries scattered a shower of destruction among the advancing boats, dimpling the river on every side of them. Scott's two pieces of artillery, under the command of Towson and Barker, kept up a sweeping fire on the opposite shore, and they were assailed in return by shells from the enemy's mortar. The river at this place was a sheet of violent eddies, which much embarrassed the boats, so that it was with great difficulty they could proceed in any order. Colonel Van Rensselaer, however, soon reached the opposite shore, with about one hundred men, a portion of each column, and effected a landing amidst a tremendous fire, directed upon him from every point, against which his column advanced very tardily. Chrystie had been less fortunate; his boat was soon perforated by the enemy's fire, and became unmanageable, while he received a shot in his hand. With some difficulty he regained the American shore, about half a mile below the point of embarkation, and afterwards crossed in another boat. Several of these frail vehicles had been destroyed in this attack, many of the pilots and boatmen deserted the enterprize, and every thing connected with it began to wear an inauspicious aspect. As soon as the remaining boats had returned, Fenwick and Mullany embarked, with as many of their men as could be carried, amounting to about two hundred in all. Destitute of pilots, and exposed to an impetuous current, they were compelled to land where they could, and found themselves immediately under the enemy's batteries, where the whole were made prisoners, except eight or ten men, who escaped with Mullany in his boat; Fenwick was severely wounded in three or four places. Ensign Willoughby, who had hitherto assisted in serving Towson's piece of artillery, was burning with impatience to participate in the glory of a closer contest. He had witnessed the fate of Fenwick's detachment, saw the tardiness with which embarkations were effected, and trembled for the fate of the little band who were desperately maintaining the footing they had gained. He was now relieved at the gun, and, without waiting for orders, or even asking permission, rushed to the shore, and sprang into the first boat that was departing. In the mean time, the troops which had effected their landing under Van Rensselaer, were hotly engaged, and gradually gaining ground on the enemy; but their leader had scarcely advanced two hundred paces when he received four wounds, and was forced to leave the field; not, however, without having first ordered his officers to proceed with rapidity, and storm the fort; at the same time imparting to them such local information as he possessed with respect to the ground which was to be contested. The troops now acted without a common commander; the regulars took the lead, led on by their respective captains, Wool, Malcolm, Armstrong, Ogilvie, and lieutenant Randolph. Other small parties, of twenty or thirty men each, followed on as the boats successively arrived. Sixty determined young heroes, ten of whom were militia, followed their leaders up the heights, and having gallantly carried a battery which was planted midway the declivity, gained the great height called the mountain. Here they gave three cheers, and rushed like tigers upon the astonished foe, who received them on the points of their bayonets. After the third charge, however, the enemy's consolidated phalanx was broken, and driven down the hill in every direction. Each individual of this intrepid band, merits a niche in the temple of Fame; would I could rescue all their names from oblivion, and enrich this page by recording them. But such is the fate of war, that Alexanders and Cæsars may fall unnoticed in the ranks, and the most exalted merit (unless decorated with an epaulet) exist unacknowledged and unrewarded. Their leader was the heroic Ogilvie, seconded by the undaunted Wool, who was still bleeding from the wounds he had received; and by his side rushed on the impetuous Willoughby; lieutenants Kearney, Carr, Hugginian, Sammons, Randolph, and Gansevoort, with ensign Reeves, followed with enthusiasm, each one emulous to be foremost in danger. Whatever be the names or rank of the remaining sixty, the noblest title in the gift of their country is incontestably theirs—the Champions of Freedom. Completely beaten and dispersed by this handful of men, the fugitives fled to the village of Queenston, where they were met and rallied by general Brock, who had brought with him a considerable detachment, and instantly advanced to the charge. The Americans still possessed the hill, to which the path of ascent was winding and difficult; but no difficulties can deter the brave—Brock led on his undaunted followers in the very face of death. His horse fell under him, and he advanced on foot. Young Willoughby, whose ardor had kept him constantly in front of the hottest battle, received a ball in his hip, and would have fallen but for the ready arm of a private soldier named Wilklow, who exclaimed—“Courage, my dear sir—I have just unhorsed the British general.” 25 “And I have done nothing;” replied Willoughby; “but give me your rifle and I may disperse the whole column.” With considerable difficulty, still supported by the soldier, he levelled the piece and fired. The gallant but unfortunate Brock fell lifeless to the earth within an hundred paces of the American line, and his panic-struck followers fled in disorder, notwithstanding all the exertions of their officers to bring them back to the charge. Men who in Egypt had acquired the title of Invincibles, became a fugitive rabble in front of a phalanx of FREEMEN. Again the Americans had time to breathe, and were, in the interval, joined by Scott, who had been ordered over to take the command of the whole of the troops engaged; but the presence of general Wadsworth, who commanded the militia, enabled him to confine his attention to the regulars, consisting of about two hundred and thirty men, whose courage and ardor had increased with the difficulties that opposed them. Scott immediately drew his little army up into a strong position, in which he could at once receive the enemy and cover the ferry; for he every moment expected to be reinforced by all the troops at Lewiston. By this time a large body of Indians, who had been collected at Fort George, were on their way to the scene of action. Their approach was announced to the routed invincibles, who were, with some difficulty, again rallied, and in conjunction with their red allies, brought to the charge. A short but terrible conflict ensued. Again were the Champions of Freedom victorious; again were the enemy completely routed by the rifle and bayonet, and compelled to fly in the wildest disorder, while the Americans pursued them as far as was compatible with the protection of the ferry, from whence a reinforcement was still expected. It was with some difficulty, however, that the ardor of pursuit could be checked by the officers, and the flushed victors reinstated in their former commanding position. During this action, the commander-in-chief himself was on the ground, and in expectation of further attacks, gave immediate orders for fortifying and strengthening the position of the troops. But perceiving no signs of an approaching reinforcement from the American shore, he immediately recrossed the river to accelerate the movements of the militia, and urge them to embark. But, alas! their ardor had entirely subsided, and no arguments could induce them to proceed. In vain the general rode through the ranks and conjured them by every thing they held dear or valuable, to join their brave countrymen in the field; in vain colonel Bloom exhibited his bleeding wounds, and exhorted them to accompany him in search of redress—they forgot to what country they belonged, and seemed content to witness the fate of their brethren on the opposite shore, while they themselves were far removed from danger. Nothing was wanting but their presence to secure the hard-earned victory, and prevent a renewal of the contest; and yet they refused to embark! The British invincibles had now again rallied. Ashamed of their disorderly flight before a handful of men who had never witnessed a regular engagement, they were at length induced to renew the attack. With direful whoops and yells, the savages commenced the assault, and several American bosoms recoiled from the impetuous charge. The advanced pickets gave way, and a host of fierce demons, blood-stained and horribly painted, plunged into the midst of the American lines. All was now confusion, horror, and dismay; defeat and massacre seemed, for a moment, inevitable, and were only prevented by the cool and deliberate bravery of Scott. Animated by his courage and example, the broken and retreating column suddenly turned upon the foe, and throwing itself forward with resistless impetuosity, bore down all before it, and again turned the “tide of war.” The enemy once more fled with precipitation, leaving a horrid rampart of human bodies in front of the American lines. After these frequent defeats, the enemy was content to wait the arrival of a column of eight hundred and fifty fresh troops from Fort George, which were perceived advancing with rapidity, and were now within a mile of Queenston Heights, commanded by general Sheaffe. Chrystie and Mullany at this moment gave Scott the unwelcome intelligence that no aid was to be expected from Lewiston, except a supply of cartridges; but that if a retreat was resorted to, general Van Rensselaer would endeavor to cover it with his cannon, and send as many boats as possible to receive them. Scott was thunderstruck at this intelligence: and, to increase his mortification, it was immediately afterwards ascertained that every boat still remained fastened to the American shore. The British reinforcements continued to advance, and the light troops and Indians were ready to renew the battle. Retreat having now become to the Americans almost as hopeless as succor, Scott resolved to receive the enemy on the ground which he occupied; when, if any survived the shock, it would be time enough to surrender. Sheaffe approached warily with his force; obliqued to the right from the road, and formed a junction with the Indians, in the rear of the Heights. No doubt he suspected that the little band of Americans in view was but the out-post of the principal army. But, whatever he thought, he advanced with firmness to the charge, when a most obstinate and bloody conflict commenced. Scott was determined on a desperate stand before he yielded; and gave his orders with intrepidity and coolness, amid a scene that would have filled common breasts with dismay. The clash of arms, the incessant roar of musketry, the dreadful thunder of ordnance, and the still more appalling yell of savages, mingled in horrid confusion; while the ground ran with blood, and was thickly covered with mangled bodies. At length they closed, with a shock that made the solid mountain tremble to its base. Scott's little band of heroes, consolidated into a close phalanx, stood the charge undismayed—almost unmoved; while many of the desperate assailants were impaled on their bristling bayonets. Nothing, for some minutes, could shake this little phalanx; but it was every moment growing weaker, being exposed to a cannonade that carried death in every discharge. At length, being nearly surrounded on all sides, they gave way, broke, and made a precipitate retreat to the bank of the river, and halted under cover of a precipice which protected them from a shower of musketry that rattled like hail-stones over their heads. Here Scott mustered the panting fugitives, and found that his little army had dwindled to one hundred and thirty nine. END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
