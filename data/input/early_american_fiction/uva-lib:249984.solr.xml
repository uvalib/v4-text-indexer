      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II.—A GUY RIVERS. VOL. II. CHAPTER I. —“Dread souls that so devise Such rugged deed, such dark amount of crime.” “Oh, fly!—I do implore—if you would live— The murderers set upon you. Hark! they come! There's but a moment left you for escape; That lost, all's over; and these eyes shall see Your heart's blood streaming—seeing nothing more.” The night began to wane, and still did Lucy Munro keep lonely vigil in her chamber. How could she sleep? Threatened herself with a connexion so dreadful as to her mind was that proposed with Guy Rivers—deeply interested as she now felt herself in the fortunes of the young stranger, for whose fate and safety, knowing the unfavourable position in which he stood with the outlaws, she had every thing to apprehend—it can cause no wonder when we say sleep grew a stranger to her eyes, and without retiring to her couch, though extinguishing her light, she sat musing by the window of her chamber upon the thousand conflicting and sad thoughts that were at strife in her spirit. She had not been long in this position when the sound of approaching horsemen reached her ears, and after a brief interval, during which she could perceive that they had alighted, she heard the door of the hall gently unclosed, and footsteps, as if set down with a nice caution, passing through the passage. A light danced for a moment fitfully along the chamber, as if borne from the sleeping apartment of Munro to that adjoining the hall in which the family were accustomed to pursue their domestic avocations. Then came an occasional murmur of speech to her ears, and then silence. Perplexed with these circumstances, and wondering at the return of Munro at an hour something unusual—prompted too by a presentiment of something wrong, and apprehensive on the score of Ralph's safety—a curiosity, not surely under these circumstances discreditable, to know what was going on, determined her to ascertain something more of the character of the nocturnal visitation. She felt assured from the strangeness of the occurrence that evil was afoot, and solicitous for its prevention, she was persuaded to the measure solely with the view to good. Hastily, yet cautiously, but with trembling hands, undoing the door of her apartment, she made her way into the long and dark gallery, with which she was perfectly familiar, and soon gained the apartment already referred to. The door fortunately stood nearly closed, and she was therefore enabled to pass it by and gain the hall, which immediately adjoined, and lay in perfect darkness; without herself being seen, she was enabled, through a crevice in the partition dividing the two rooms, to survey its inmates, and to hear distinctly at the same time every thing that was uttered. As she expected, there were the two conspirators, Rivers and Munro, earnestly engaged in discourse; to which, as it concerns materially our progress, we may well be permitted to lend our attention. They spoke on a variety of topics entirely foreign to the understanding of the half-affrighted and nervously-susceptible, but still resolute young girl who heard them; and nothing but her deep anxieties for one, whose own importance in her eyes at that moment she did not conjecture, could have sustained her while listening to a dialogue full of atrocious intention and development, and larded throughout with a familiar and sometimes foul phraseology that certainly was not altogether unseemly in such association. “Well, Blundell's gone too, they say. He's heartily frightened. A few more will follow, and we must both be out of the way. The rest could not well be identified, and whether they are or not does not concern me, except that they may blab of their confederates. Such as seem likely to suffer detection must be frightened off; and this, by-the-way, is not so difficult a matter. Pippin knows nothing of himself. Forrester is too much involved to be forward. It was in this way I aroused and set him on. His hot blood took fire at some little hints that I threw out, and the fool became a leader in the mischief. There's no danger from him—besides, they say, he's off too. Old Walton has broken off the match between him and his daughter on this very score, and the fellow's almost mad on the strength of it. So Raymond tells me, and, I take it, truly. There's but one left who might trouble us, and it is now understood that a single mode only offers for his silence. We are perfectly agreed as to this, and no more scruples.” The quick sense of the maiden readily taught her who the one meant was; and her heart trembled convulsively within her, as with a word, Munro, replying to Rivers, gave his assent. “Why, yes—it must be done, I suppose, though somehow or other I would it could be got rid of in any other way.” “You see for yourself, Wat, there can be no other way; for as long as he lives, there is no security. The few surviving guard will be seen to, and they saw too little to be dangerous. They were like stunned and stupified men. This boy alone was cool and collected, and is so obstinate in what he knows and thinks, that he troubles neither himself nor his neighbours with doubt or difficulty. I knew him a few years ago, when something more of a boy than now; and even then he was the same character.” “But why not let him start, and take the woods for it? How easy to settle the matter on the road-side, in a thousand different ways. The accumulation of these occurrences in the village, as much as any thing else, will break us up. I don't care for myself, for I expect to be off for a time, but I want to see the old woman and Lucy keep quiet possession here; but—” “You are becoming an old woman yourself, Wat, and should be under guardianship. All these scruples are late; and indeed, even were they not, they would be still useless. We have determined on the thing, and the sooner we set about it the better. The night wanes; and I have much to see to before daylight. To-morrow I must sleep— sleep—” and for a moment Rivers seemed to muse upon the word sleep, which he thrice repeated, then suddenly proceeding, as if no pause had taken place, he abruptly placed his hand upon the shoulder of Munro, and asked— “You will bear the lantern—this is all you need perform. I am resolute for the rest.” “What will you use—dirk?”— “Yes—it is silent in its office, and not less sure. Are all asleep, think you—your wife?” “Quite so—sound when I entered the chamber.” “Well, the sooner to business the better. Is there water in that pitcher? I am strangely thirsty to-night—brandy were not amiss at such a time.” And speaking this to himself, as it were, Rivers approached the side-table, where stood the commodities he sought. In this approach the maiden had a more perfect view of the malignities of his savage face; and as he left the table, and again commenced a brief conversation in an under-tone with Munro, no longer doubting the dreadful object which they had in view, she seized the opportunity with as much speed as was consistent with caution and her trembling nerves, to leave the place of espionage, and seek her chamber. But to what purpose had she heard all this, if she suffered the fearful deed to proceed to execution. The thought was momentary, but carried to her heart, in that moment, the fullest conviction of her duty. She rushed hurriedly again into the passage—and though apprehending momentarily that her knees would sink from under her—took her way up the narrow flight of steps leading into the second story, and to the youth's chamber. As she reached the door, a feminine scruple came over her. A young girl seeking the apartment of a man at midnight— she shrunk back with a new feeling. But the dread necessity drove her on, and with cautious hand undoing the latch which secured the door by thrusting her hand through an interstice between the logs—wondering at the same time at the incautious manner in which, at such a period and place, the youth had provided for his sleeping hours—she stood tremblingly within the chamber. Wrapped in unconscious slumbers, Ralph Colleton lay dreaming upon his rude couch of a thousand strange influences and associations. His roving fancies had gone to and fro, between his uncle and his bewitching cousin, until his heart grew softened and satisfied, not less with the native pleasures which they revived in his memory, than of the sweet oblivion which they brought of the many painful and perilous prospects with which he had more recently become familiar. He had no thought of the present, and the pictures of the past were all rich and ravishing. To his wandering sense at that moment there came a sweet vision of beauty and love—of an affection warmly cherished— green as the summer leaves—fresh as its flowers— flinging odours about his spirit, and reawakening in its fullest extent the partially slumbering passion —reviving many a hope, and provoking with many a delicious anticipation. The form of the one, lovely beyond comparison, flitted before him, while her name, murmured with words of passion by his parted lips, carried with its utterance a sweet promise of a pure faith, and an unforgetting affection. Never once, since the hour of his departure from home, had he, in his waking moments, permitted that name to find a place upon his lips, and now syllabled into sound by them in his unconscious dreams, it fell with a stunning influence upon an auditor, whose heart grew colder in due proportion with the unconscious but warm tenderness of epithet with which his tongue coupled its utterance. The now completely unhappy Lucy stood sad and statue-like. She heard enough to teach her the true character of her own feelings for one, whose articulated dreams had revealed the secret of his passion for another; and almost forgetting for a while the office upon which she had come, she continued to give ear to those sounds which brought to her heart only additional misery. How long Ralph, in his mental wanderings, would have gone on, as we have seen, incoherently developing his heart's history, may not be said. Gathering courage at last, with a noble energy the maiden proceeded to her proposed duty, and his slumbers were broken. With a half-awakened consciousness he raised himself partially up in his couch, and sought to listen. He was not deceived; a whispered sentence came to his ears, addressed to himself, and succeeded by a pause of several moments' continuance. Again his name was uttered. Half doubting his senses, he passed his hand repeatedly over his eyes, and again listened for the repetition of that voice, the identity of which he had as yet failed utterly to distinguish. The sounds were repeated, and the words grew more and more distinct. He now caught in part the tenor of the sentence, though imperfectly heard. It seemed to convey some warning of danger, and the person who spoke appeared, from the tremulous accents, to labour under many apprehensions. The voice proceeded with increased emphasis, advising his instant departure from the house—speaking of nameless dangers— of murderous intrigue and conspiracy, and warning against even the delay of a single instant. The character of Ralph was finely marked, and firmness of purpose and a ready decision were among its most prominent attributes. Hastily leaping from his couch, therefore, with a single bound he reached the door of his chamber, which, to his astonishment, he found entirely unfastened. The movement was so sudden and so entirely unlooked for, that the intruder was taken by surprise; and beheld, while the youth closed securely the entrance, the hope of escape entirely cut off. Ralph advanced towards his visiter, the dim outline of whose person was visible upon the wall. Lifting his arm as he approached, what was his astonishment to perceive the object of his assault sink before him upon the floor, while the pleading voice of a woman called upon him for mercy. “Spare me, Mr. Colleton—spare me”—she exclaimed, in undisguised terror. “You here, Miss Munro, and at this hour of the night?” was the wondering inquiry, as he lifted her from the ground, her limbs, trembling with agitation, scarcely able to support even her slender form. “Forgive me, sir, forgive me. Think not ill of me, I pray you. I come to save you,—indeed, Mr. Colleton, I do—and nothing, believe me, would have brought me here but the knowledge of your immediate danger.” She felt the delicacy of her situation, and recognising her motive readily, we will do him the justice to say, Ralph felt it too in the assurance of her lips. A respectful delicacy pervaded his manner as he inquired earnestly— “What is this danger, Miss Munro? I believe you fear for me, but may you not have exaggerated the cause of alarm to yourself. What have I to fear—from what would you save me?” “Nay, ask me not, sir, but fly. There is but little time for explanation, believe me. I know and do not imagine the danger. I cannot tell you all, nor can you with safety bestow the time to hear. Your murderers are awake—they are in this very house, and nothing but instant flight can save you from their hands.” “But from whom, Miss Munro, am I to fear all this. What has given you this alarm, which, until you can give me some clue to this mystery, I must regard as unadvised and without foundation. I feel the kindness and interest of your solicitude— Vol. II.—B deeply feel, and greatly respect it; but, unless you can give me some reasonable instance for your fears, I must be stubborn in resisting a conviction which would have me fly, like a midnight felon, without having even seen the face of my foe.” “Oh, heed not these false scruples. There is no shame in such a flight, and believe me, sir, I speak not unadvisedly. Nothing, sir, but the most urgent and immediate danger would have prompted me, at this hour, to come here. If you would survive this night, take advantage of the moment and fly. This moment you must determine—I know not, indeed, if it be not too late even now for your extrication. The murderers, by this time, are upon the way to your chamber, and they will not heed your prayers, and they will scorn any defence which you might offer.” “But who are they of whom you speak, Miss Munro? If I must fly, let me at least know from what and whom. What are my offences, and who are they whom I have offended?” “That is soon told, though I fear me, sir, we waste the time in doing so. You have offended Rivers, and you know but little of him if you think it possible for him to forget or forgive where once injured, however slightly. The miners generally have been taught to regard you as one whose destruction alone can ensure their safety from punishment for their late aggressions. My uncle too, I grieve to say it, is too much under the influence of Rivers, and does indeed just what his suggestions prescribe. They have plotted your death, and will not scruple at its performance. They are even now below, meditating its execution. By the merest good fortune I overheard their design, from which I feel persuaded nothing now can make them recede. Rely nothing on their fear of human punishment. They care perhaps just as little for the laws of man as of God, both of which they violate hourly with impunity, and from both of which they have always hitherto contrived to secure themselves. Let me entreat, therefore, that you will take no heed of that manful courage which would be honourable and proper with a fair enemy. Do not think that I am a victim to unmeasured and womanly fears. I have seen too much of the doings of these men, not to feel that no fancies of mine can do them injustice. They would murder you in your bed, and walk from the scene of their crime with confidence into the very courts of justice.” “I believe you, Miss Munro, and nothing doubt the correctness of your opinion with regard to the character of these men. Indeed, I have reason to know that what you say of Rivers, I have already realized in my own person. This attempt, if he makes it, will be the second in which he has put my life in hazard, and I believe him, therefore, not too good for any attempt of this evil nature. But why may I not defend myself from the assassins? I can make these logs tenable till daylight from all their assaults, and then I should receive succour from the villagers without question. You see, too, I have arms which may prove troublesome to an enemy.” “Trust not these chances: let me entreat that you rely not upon them. Were you able, as you say, to sustain yourself for the rest of the night in this apartment, there would be no relief in the morning, for how would you make your situation understood? Many of the villagers will have flown before to-morrow into the nation, until the pursuit is well over, which will most certainly be commenced before long. Some of them have already gone, having heard of the approach of the residue of the Georgia Guard, to which the survivors at the late affair bore the particulars. Those who venture to remain will not come nigh this house, dreading to be involved in the difficulties which now threaten its occupants. Their caution would only be the more increased on hearing of any commotion. Wait not, therefore, I implore you, for the dawning of the day: it could never dawn to you. Rivers I know too well: he would overreach you by some subtlety or other; and how easy, even while we speak, to shoot you down through these distorted logs. Trust not, trust not, I entreat you; there is a sure way of escape, and you still have time, if at once you avail yourself of it.” The maid spoke with earnestness and warmth, for the terrors of her mind had given animation to her anxiety, while she sought to persuade the somewhat stubborn youth into the proposed and certainly judicious flight she contemplated for him. Her trepidation had made her part with much of that retreating timidity which had usually distinguished her manner; and perfectly assured herself of the causes of her present apprehension, she did not scruple to exhibit—indeed she did not seem altogether conscious of—the deep interest which she took in the fate and fortunes of him who stood beside her. Flattered as he must have been by the marked feeling, which she could neither disguise nor he mistake, the youth did not, however, for a moment seek to abuse it; but with a habit at once gentle and respectful, combated the various arguments and suggestions which, with a single eye to his safety, she urged for his departure. In so doing, he obtained from her all the particulars of her discovery, and was at length convinced that her apprehensions were by no means groundless. She had accidentally come upon the conspirators at an interesting moment in their deliberations, which at once revealed their object and its aim; and he at length saw that, except in flight, according to her proposition, the chances were numerous against his safety. While they thus deliberated, the distant sound of a chair falling below, occurring at an hour so unusual, gave an added force to her suggestions, and while it prompted anew her entreaties, greatly diminished his reluctance to the flight. “I will do just as you advise. I know not, Miss Munro, why my fate and fortune should have provoked in you such an interest, unless it be that yours being a less selfish sex than ours, you are not apt to enter into calculations as to the loss of quiet or of personal risk, which, in so doing, you may incur. Whatever be the motive, however, I am grateful for its effects, and shall not readily forget the gentleness of that spirit which has done so much for the solace and the safety of one so sad in its aspect and so much a stranger in all respects.” The youth spoke with emphasis; and coupled as was his language with a tone and manner the most tender yet respectful, it necessarily relieved from all perplexity that feeling of propriety and maiden delicacy, which otherwise must have made her situation an awkward one. Ralph was not so dull, however, as not to perceive, that, to a livelier emotion, he might in justice attribute the conduct of his companion; but with a highly honourable fastidiousness, he himself suggested a motive for her proceeding, which her own delicacy rendered improper for her utterance. Still the youth was not marble exactly; and, as he spoke, his arm B 2 gently encircled her waist: and her form, as if incapable of its own support, hung for a moment, with apathetic lifelessness, upon his bosom; while her head, with an impulse not difficult to define, drooped like a bending and dewy lily upon his arm. But the passive emotion, if we may so style it, was soon over; and, with an effort, in which firmness and feebleness strongly encountered, she freed herself from his hold with an erect pride of manner, which gave a sweet finish to the momentary display which she had made of womanly weakness. Her voice, as she called upon him to follow her into the passage, was again firm in a moment, and pervaded by a cold ease which seemed to him artificial. “There is but little time left you now, sir, for escape: it were criminal not to use it. Follow me boldly, but cautiously—I will lead the way—the house is familiar to me, in night and day, and there must be no waste of time.” He would have resisted this conduct, and himself taken the lead in the advance; but placing her small and trembling hand upon his arm, she insisted upon the course she had prescribed, and in a manner which he did not venture to resist. Their steps were slow into the open space which, seeming as an introduction to, at the same time separated the various chambers of the dwelling, and terminated in the large and cumbrous stairway which conducted to the lower story, and to which their course was now directed. The passage was of some length, but with cautious tread they proceeded in safety and without noise to the head of the stairway, when the maiden, who still preserved the lead, motioned him back, retreating herself, as she did so, into the cover of a small recess, formed by the stairs, which it partially overhung, and presenting a doubtful apology for a closet. Its door hung upon a broken and single hinge, unclosed, leaving however so small an aperture that it might be difficult to account for their entrance. There, amid the dust and mystery of time-worn household trumpery, old saddles, broken bridles, and more than one dismembered harness, they came to a pause, and were enabled now to perceive the realization in part of her apprehensions. A small lantern, the rays of light from which feebly made their way through a single square in front, disclosed to the sight the dim forms of the two assassins, moving upward to the contemplated deed of blood. The terrors of Lucy, as she surveyed their approach, were great; but with a mind and spirit beyond those commonly in the possession of her sex, she was enabled to conquer and rise above them; and though her heart beat with a thick and hurried apprehension, her soul grew calmer the more closely approached the danger. Her alarm to the mind of Ralph was now sufficiently justified, as, looking through a crevice in the narrow apartment in which he stood, he surveyed the malignant and hell-branded visage of Rivers, peering like a dim and baleful light in advance of his companion; in whose face a partial glimmer of the lamp revealed a something of reluctance, which rendered it doubtful how far Munro had in reality gone willingly on the task. It was, under all the circumstances, a curious survey for the youth. He was a man of high passions, sudden of action, impetuous and unhesitating. In a fair field, he would not have been at a loss for a single moment; but here, the situation was so new, that he was more and more undetermined in his spirit. He saw them commissioned with his murder, treading, one by one, the several steps below him—approaching momently nigher and nigher— and his heart beat audibly with conflicting emotions, while with one hand he grasped convulsively and desperately the handle of his dirk—the other being fully employed in sustaining the almost fainting form of his high-souled but delicate companion. He felt that, if discovered, he could do little in his defence and against assault; and though without a thought but that of fierce struggle to the last, his reason taught him to perceive with how little hope of success. As they continued to advance, he could distinctly trace every change of expression in their several countenances. In that of Rivers, linked with the hideousness that his wound conferred upon it, he noted the more wicked workings of a spirit, the fell character of whose features received no moderate exaggeration from the dim and flickering glare of the lamp which his hand unsteadily carried. The whole face had in it something awfully fearful. He seemed, in its expression, already striking the blow at the breast of his victim, or rioting with a fiendish revenge in his groaned agonies. A brief dialogue between his companion and himself more fully describes the character of the monster. “Stay—you hurry too much in this matter—” said Munro, putting his hand on that of Rivers, and restraining his steps for a moment as he paused, seemingly to listen. He continued,— “Your hand trembles, Rivers, and you let your lamp dance about too much to find it useful. Your footstep is hurried, and but now the stairs creaked heavily beneath you. You must proceed with more caution, or we shall be overheard. These are sleepless times, and this youth, who appears to trouble you more than man ever troubled you before, may be just as much awake as ourselves. If you are determined in this thing, be not imprudent.” Rivers, who on reaching the head of the flight had been about to hurry forward precipitately, now paused, though with much reluctance; and to the speech of his companion, with a fearful expression of the lips, which, as they parted, disclosed the teeth white and closely clenched beneath them, replied, though without directly referring to its import— “If I am determined—do you say!—But is not that the chamber where he sleeps?” “No; old Barton sleeps there—he sleeps at the end of the gallery. Be calm—why do you work your fingers in that manner?” “See you not my knife is in them? I thought at that moment that it was between his ribs and working about in his heart. It was a sweet fancy, and, though I could not hear his groans as I stooped over him to listen, I almost thought I felt them.” The hand of the maiden grasped that of Ralph convulsively as these muttered words came to their ears, and her respiration grew more difficult and painful. He shuddered at the vindictive spirit which the wretch exhibited, while his own, putting on a feller and a fiercer temper, could scarcely resist the impulse which would have prompted him at once to rush forth and stab him where he stood. But the counsels of prudence had their influence, and he remained quiet and firm. The companion of the ruffian felt no less than his other hearers the savage nature of this mood, as thus, in his way, he partially rebuked it:— “These are horrid fancies, Rivers—more like those which we should look to find in a panther than in a man, and you delight in them quite too much. Can you not kill your enemy without drinking his blood?” “And where then would be the pleasure of revenge?”—he muttered, between his closed teeth. “The soldier who in battle slays his opponent, hates him not—he has no personal animosity to indulge. The man has never crossed his path in love or in ambition—yet he shoots him down, ruthlessly and relentlessly. Shall he do no more who hates— who fears—who sickens at the sight of the man who has crossed his path in love and in ambition? I tell you, Munro, I hate this boy—this beardless, this overweening and insolent boy. He has overthrown, he has mortified me, where I alone should have stood supreme and supereminent. He has wronged me—it may be without intention; but, what care I for that qualification. Shall it be less an evil because he by whom it is perpetrated has neither the soul nor the sense to be conscious of his error. The child who trifles with the powder match is lessoned by the explosion which destroys him. It must be so with him. I never yet forgave a wrong, however slight and unimportant—I never will. It is not in my nature to do so; and as long as this boy can sleep at night, I cannot. I will not seek to sleep until he is laid in the long and unbroken slumber.” The whole of this brief dialogue, which had passed directly beside the recess in which the maiden and youth had taken shelter, was distinctly audible to them both. The blood of Ralph boiled within him at this latter speech of the ruffian, in which he avowed a spirit of such dire malignity, as, in its utter disproportionateness to the supposed offence of the youth, could only have been sanctioned by the nature which he had declared to have always been his prompter; and, at its close, the arm of the youth, grasping his weapon, was involuntarily stretched forth, and an instant more would have found it buried in the bosom of the wretch—but the action did not escape the quick eye of his companion, who, though trembling with undiminished terror, was yet mistress of all her senses, and perceived the ill-advised nature of his design. With a motion equally involuntary and sudden with his own, her taper fingers grasped his wrist, and her eyes bright with dewy lustres, were directed upwards, sweetly and appealingly to those which now bent themselves down upon her. In that moment of excitement and impending terror, a consciousness of her situation and a sense of shame which more than ever agitated her, rushed through her mind, and she leaned against the side of the closet for that support for which her now revived and awakened scruples forbade any reference to him from whom she had so recently received it. Still, there was nothing abrupt or unkind in her manner, and the youth did not hesitate again to place his arm around and in support of the form which, in reality, needed his services. In doing so, however, a slight noise was the consequence, which the quick sense of Rivers readily discerned. “Hark!—heard you nothing, Munro—no sound? Hear you no breathing?—It seems near at hand,— in that closet.” “Thou hast a quick ear to-night, Guy, as well as a quick step. I heard, and hear nothing, save the snorings of old Barton, whose chamber is just beside you to the left. He has always had a reputation for the wild music which his nose contrives, during his sleep, to keep up in his neighbourhood.” “It came from the opposite quarter, Munro, and was not unlike the suppressed respiration of one who listens.” “Pshaw! that cannot be. There is no chamber there. That is but the old closet in which we store away lumber. You are quite too regardful of your senses. They will keep us here all night, and the fact is, I wish the business well over.” “Where does Lucy sleep?” “In the off shed-room below. What of her?” “Of her—oh nothing!” and Rivers paused musingly in the utterance of this reply, which fell syllable by syllable from his lips. The landlord proceeded:— “Pass on, Rivers; pass on: or have you determined better about this matter? Shall the youngster live? Indeed, I see not that his evidence, even if he gives it, which I very much doubt, can do us much harm, seeing that a few days more will put us out of the reach of judge and jury alike.” “You would have made a prime counsellor and subtle disputant, Munro, worthy of the Philadelphia lawyers,” returned the other, in a sneer, which has, from what cause we know not, become a proverb in the southern country. “You think only of one part of this subject, and have no passions, no emotions: you can talk all day long on matters of feeling, without showing any. Did I not say but now, that while that boy slept I could not?” “Are you sure that when he ceases to sleep the case will be any better!” The answer to this inquiry was unheard, as the goodly pair passed on to the tenantless chamber. Watching their progress, and under the guidance of the young maiden, who seemed endued with a courage and conduct worthy of more experience and a stronger sex, our hero emerged from his place of precarious and uncomfortable concealment, and descended to the lower floor. A few moments sufficed to throw the saddle upon his steed, without arousing the sable groom; and having brought him under the shadow of a tree at some little distance from the house, he found no further obstruction in the way of his safe and sudden flight. He had fastened the door of his chamber on leaving it with much more caution than upon retiring for the night; and having withdrawn the key, which he now hurled into the woods, he felt assured that, unless the assassins had other than the common modes of entry, he should gain a little time from the delay they would experience from this interruption; and this interval, returning to the doorway, he employed in acknowledgments which were well due to the young and trembling woman who stood beside him. “Take this little token, sweet Lucy,” said he, throwing about her neck the chain and casket which he had unbound from his own—“take this little token of Ralph Colleton's gratitude for this night's good service. I shall redeem it, if I live, at a more pleasant season, but you must keep it for me now. I will not soon forget the devotedness with which, on this occasion, you have perilled so much for a stranger. Should we never again meet, I pray you to remember me in your prayers, as I shall always remember you in mine.” He little knew, while thus he spoke, in a manner, so humbly of himself, of the deep interest which his uniform gentleness of manner and respectful deference, so different to what she had been accustomed in that region to encounter, had inspired in her bosom; and so small at this period was his vanity, that he did not trust himself for a moment to regard the conjecture—which ever and anon thrust itself upon him—that the fearless devotion of the maiden in his behalf and for his safety, had in reality a far more selfish origin than the mere general humanity of her sex and spirit. We will not say that Vol. II.—C she would not have done the same by any other member of the human family in like circumstances; but it is not uncharitable to believe that she would have been less anxiously interested, less warm in her interest, and less pained in the event of an unfortunate result. Clasping the gorgeous chain about her neck, his arm again gently encircled her waist—her head drooped upon her bosom—she did not speak—she appeared scarcely to feel. For a moment, life and all its pulses seemed resolutely at a stand; and with some apprehensions, the youth drew her to his bosom, and spoke with words full of tenderness. She made no answer to his immediate speech; but her hands, as if unconsciously, struck the spring which locked the casket which hung upon the chain,and the miniature lay open before her, the dim light of the moon shining down upon it. She reclosed it suddenly, and undoing it from the chain, placed it with a trembling hand in his own; and with an effort of calm and quiet playfulness, reminded him of the unintended gift. He received it, but only to place it again in her hand, reuniting it to the chain. “Keep it,” said he, “Miss Munro—keep it until I return to reclaim it. It will be as safe in your hands—much safer indeed, than in mine. She whose features it describes will not chide, that, at a moment of peril, I place it in the care of one as gentle as herself.” Her eyes were downcast, as, again receiving it, she inquired with a girlish simplicity, “Is her name Edith, Mr. Colleton, of whom these features are the likeness?” The youth, surprised by the question, met the inquiry with another. “How know you?—wherefore do you ask?” She saw his astonishment, and with a calm which had not, during the whole scene between them, marked her voice or demeanour, she replied instantly:— “No matter—no matter, sir. I know not well why I put the question—certainly with no object; and am now more than answered.” The youth pondered over the affair in silence for a few moments, but desirous of satisfying the curiosity of the maiden, though on a subject and in relation to one of whom he had sworn himself to silence—wondering, at the same time, not less at the inquiry than the knowledge, in part at least, which it conveyed, of that which he had locked up, as he thought, in the recesses of his own bosom,— was about to reply, when a hurried step, and a sudden noise from the upper apartment of the house, warned them of the dangers of further delay. The maiden interrupted with rapid tones the speech he was about to commence:— “Fly, sir,—fly. There is no time to be lost. You have lingered too long already. Do not hesitate longer—you have heard the determination of Rivers—this disappointment will only make him more furious. Fly, then, and speak not. Take the left road at the fork: it leads to the river. It is the dullest, and if they pursue, they will be most likely to fall into the other.” “Farewell, then, my good, my protecting angel —I shall not forget you—have no apprehensions for me—I have now but few for myself. Yet, ere I go—” and he bent down, and before she was conscious of his design, his lips were pressed warmly to her pale and beautiful forehead. “Be not vexed —chide me not,” he murmured—“regard me as a brother—if I live I shall certainly become one, Farewell!” Leaping with a single bound to his saddle, he stood erect for a moment, then vigorously applying his spurs, he had vanished in an instant from the sight. She paused until the steps of his steed ceased to fall upon her ears; then, with a mournful spirit and a heavy step, she slowly re-entered the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. —“Where goes he, on what route! If thou deny'st me, by the gods, I swear, The wrath I've kept for him, with treasured hate, That sought no other game, I'll wreak on thee— I'll stab thee on the instant—speak, or die!” Lucy Munro re-entered the dwelling at a moment most inopportune. It was not less her obvious policy than desire—prompted as well by the necessity of escaping the notice and consequent suspicions of those whom she had defrauded of their prey, as by a due sense of that delicate propriety which belonged to her sex, and which her education, as the reader will have conjectured, had taught her properly to estimate—that made her now seek to avoid scrutiny or observation at the moment of her return. Though the niece, and now under the sole direction and authority of Munro, she was the child of one as little like that personage in spirit and pursuit as may well be imagined. It is not necessary that we should more particularly dwell upon this difference. It happened with the two brothers, as many of us have discovered in other cases, that their mental and moral make, though seemingly under the same tutorship, was widely dissimilar. The elder Munro, at an early period in life, broke through all restraints—defied all responsibilities—scorned all human consequences, took no pride or pleasure in any of its domestic associations, and was only known as a vicious profligate, with whom nothing might be done in the way of restraint or reformation. When grown to manhood, he suddenly left his parental home, and went, for a time, no one could say whither. When heard of, it appeared from all accounts that his licentiousness of habit had not deserted him,—still, however, it had not, as had been anticipated, led to any fearful or very pernicious results. Years passed on, the parents died, and the brothers grew more than ever separate; when, in different and remote communities, they each took wives to themselves. The younger, Edgar Munro, the father of Lucy, grew prosperous in business—for a season at least—and, until borne down by a rush of unfavourable and conflicting circumstances, he spared neither pains nor expense in the culture of the young mind of that daughter whose fortunes are now somewhat before us. Nothing which might tend in the slightest to her personal improvement had been withheld; and the due feminine grace and accomplishment which followed these cares, fitted the maiden for the most refined intellectual converse, and for every gentle association. She was familiar with books; had acquired a large taste for letters; and a vein of romantic enthusiasm, not uncommon to the southern temperament, and which she possessed in a considerable degree, was not a little sharpened and exaggerated by the works which fell into her hands. It was, possibly, the influence of such an education which impelled her to the risk which she had taken for the safety of Ralph Colleton. Tenderly loved and gently nurtured by her parents, it was at that period in her life in which their presence and guardianship were most seriously needed, that she became an orphan; and her future charge necessarily devolved upon an C 2 uncle, between whom and her father, since their early manhood, but little commerce or association of any kind had taken place. The one looked upon the other as too licentious, if not criminally so, in his habits and pursuits—he did not know their extent, or dream of their character, or he had never doubted for an instant; while he, in turn, so estimated, did not fail to consider and to style his more sedate brother an inveterate and tedious proser; a dull sermonizer on feelings which he knew nothing about, and could never understand—one who prosed on to the end of the chapter, without charm or change, worrying all about him with exhortations to which they yielded no regard. The parties were fairly quits, and there was no love lost between them. They saw each other but seldom, and when the surviving brother took up his abode in the new purchase, as the Indian acquisitions of modern times have been usually styled, he was lost sight of, for a time, entirely, by his more staid and worthy kinsman. Still, Edgar Munro did not look upon his brother as utterly bad. A wild indifference to social forms, and those staid customs which in the estimation of society become virtues, was, in his idea, the most serious error of which Walter had been guilty—in this thought he persisted to the last, and did not so much feel the privations to which his death must subject his child, in the belief and hope that his brother would not only be able but willing to supply the loss. In one respect he was not mistaken. The afflictions which threw the niece of Walter a dependant upon his bounty, and a charge upon his attention, revived, in some measure, his almost smothered, and in part forgotten regards of kindred; and with a tolerably good grace he came forward to the duty, and took the orphan to the asylum, such as it was, to which his brother's deathbed prayer had recommended her. At first, there was something to her young mind savouring of the romance to which she had rather given herself up, in the notion of a woodland cottage, and rural sports, and wild vines gadding fantastically around secluded bowers; but the reality—the sad reality of such a home and its associations—pressed too soon and heavily upon her to permit her much longer to entertain or encourage the dream of that glad fancy in which she originally set out. The sphere of her transfer, it was soon evident, was neither grateful to the heart nor suited to the mind whose education had been such as hers; and the spirit of the young maiden, at all times given rather to a quiet aspect of melancholy than to any very animated impulses, put on, in its new abiding place, a garb of increased severity, which at certain moments indicated more of deep and settled misanthropy than any mere constitutionality of habit. Munro was not at all times rude of speech and manner; and, when he pleased, knew well how so to direct himself as to soothe such a disposition. He saw, and in a little while well understood, the temper of his niece; and with a consideration under all circumstances rather creditable, he would most usually defer, with a ready accommodation of his own, to her peculiarities. He was pleased and proud of her accomplishments; and from being thus proud, so far as such an emotion could consistently comport with a life and a licentiousness such as his, he had learned, in reality, to love the object who could thus awaken a sentiment so much beyond those inculcated by all his other habits. To her, he exhibited none of the harsh manner which marked his intercourse with all other persons; and, in his heart, sincerely regretted, and sought to avoid the necessity, which, as we have elsewhere seen, had made him pledge her hand to Rivers—a disposition of it which he knew was no less galling and painful to her than it was irksome yet unavoidable to himself. Unhappily, however, for these sentiments, he was too much under the control and at the mercy of his colleague to resist or refuse his application for her person; and though for a long time baffling, under vain pretences, the pursuit of that ferocious ruffian, he felt that the time was at hand, unless some providential interference willed it otherwise, when the sacrifice would be insisted on and must be made; or, probably, her safety, as well as his own, might necessarily be compromised. He knew too well the character of Rivers, and was too much in his power to risk much in opposition to his will and desires: and, as we have already heard him declare, from having been at one time, and in some respects, the tutor, he had now become, from the operation of circumstances, the mere creature and instrument of that unprincipled wretch. Whatever may have been the crimes of Munro beyond those already developed—known to, and in the possession of Rivers—and whatever the nature of those ties, as well of league as of mutual risk, which bound the parties together in such close affinity, it is not necessary that we should state, nor, indeed, might it be altogether within our compass or capacity to do so. Their connexion had, we doubt not, many ramifications; and was strengthened, there is little question, by a thousand mutual necessities, resulting from their joint and frequently repeated violations of the laws of the land. They were both members of an irregular club, known by its constituents in Georgia as the most atrocious criminal that ever offended society or defied its punishments; and the almost masonic mysteries and bond which distinguished the members provided them with a pledge of security, which gave an added impetus to their already reckless vindictiveness against man and humanity. In a country, the population of which, few and far between, is spread over a wide, wild, and little cultivated territory, the chances of punishment for crime, rarely realized, scarcely occasioned a thought among offenders; and invited, by the impunity which marked their atrocities, their reiterated commission. We have digressed, however, somewhat from our narrative, but thus much was necessary to the proper understanding of the portions immediately before us, and to the consideration of which we now return. The moment was inopportune, as we have already remarked, at which Lucy Munro endeavoured to effect her return to her own apartment. She was compelled, for the attainment of this object, to cross directly over the great hall, from the room adjoining and back of which the little shed-room projected in which she lodged. This hall was immediately entered upon from the passage way, leading into the court in front, and but a few steps were necessary for its attainment. The hall had but a single outlet besides that through which she now entered, and this led at once into the adjoining apartment, through which only could she make her way to her own. Unhappily, this passage also contained the stairway flight which led into the upper story of the building; and, in her haste to accomplish her return, she had penetrated too far to effect her retreat, when a sudden change of direction in the light which Rivers carried, sufficed to develop the form of that person, at the foot of the stairs, followed by Munro, just returning from the attempt which she had rendered fruitless, and now approaching directly towards her. Conscious of the awkwardness of her situation, and with a degree of apprehension which now for the first time seemed to paralyze altogether her faculties, she endeavoured, but with some uncertainty and hesitation of manner, to gain the shelter of the wall which stretched dimly beside her; a hope not entirely vain, had she pursued it decisively, since the lamp which Rivers carried gave forth but a feeble ray, barely adequate to the task of guiding the footsteps of those who employed it. But the glance of the outlaw, rendered, it would seem, more malignantly penetrating from his recent disappointment, detected the movement; and though, from the imperfectness of the light, uncertain of the object, with a ready activity, the result of a conviction that the long sought-for victim was now before him, he sprung forward, flinging aside the lamp as he did so, and grasping with one hand and with rigid gripe the almost fainting girl, the other brandishing a bared knife, was uplifted to strike, when her shrieks arrested the blow. Disappointed in not finding the object he sought, the fury of the outlaw was rather heightened than diminished when he discovered that his arm only encircled a young and terrified female; and his teeth were gnashed in token of the bitter wrath in his bosom, and angry curses came from his lips in the undisguised vexation of his spirit. In the meantime, Munro advanced, and the lamp having been dashed out in the onset of Rivers, they were still ignorant of the character of their prisoner, until having somewhat recovered from her first alarm, and struggling at her deliverance from the painful gripe which secured her arm, she exclaimed:— “Unhand me, sir—unhand me, on the instant. What mean you by this violence?” “Ha! it is you then, fair mistress, that have done this work. It is you that have intermeddled in matters so far beyond your accustomed province, interfering in the concerns of men, prying into their plans, and arresting their execution. By my soul, I had not thought you so ready or so apt; but how do you reconcile it to your notions of propriety to be abroad at an hour which is something late for a coy damsel? Munro—you must look to these rare doings, or they will work you some difficulty in time to come.” Munro advanced and addressed her with some sternness—“Why are you abroad, Lucy, and at this hour? why this seeming disquietude, and what has alarmed you? why have you left your chamber?” The uncle did not obtain, nor indeed did he appear to expect any answer to his inquiries; they seemed merely to have been put for form sake. In the mean while, Rivers still held possession of her arm, and she continued fruitlessly struggling for some moments in his grasp, referring at length to the speaker for that interference which he now appeared slow to manifest. “Oh, sir—will you suffer me to be treated thus —will you not make this man undo his hold, and let me retire to my chamber?” “You should have been there long before this, Lucy,” was the reply, in a grave, stern accent. “You must not complain if, found thus, at midnight, in a part of the building remote from your chamber, you should be liable to suspicions of meddling with things which should not concern you.” “Come, mistress—pray answer to this. Where have you been to-night—what doing—why abroad. Have you been eaves-dropping—telling tales— hatching plots?” The natural ferocity of Rivers's manner was rather heightened by the tone which he assumed. The maiden, struggling still for the release for which her spirit would not suffer her to implore— exclaimed:— “Insolent! By what right ask you these or any questions of me? Unhand me, coward—unhand me. You are strong and brave only where the feeble are your opponents.” But he maintained his grasp with even more rigidity than before; and she turned towards the spot at which stood her uncle, but he had left the apartment for a light. “Your speech is bold, fair mistress, and ill suits my temper. You must be more chary of your language, or you will provoke me beyond my own strength of restraint. You are my property— my slave, if I so please it, and all your appeals to your uncle will be of no effect. Hark you—you have done that to-night for which I am almost tempted to put this dagger into your heart, woman as you are. You have come between me and my victim—between me and my enemy. I had summed up all my wrongs, intending their settlement to-night. You have thwarted all my hopes—you have defrauded me of all my anticipations. What is it prevents me from putting you to death on the spot? Nothing—I have no fears, no loves to withhold and keep me back. I live but for revenge, and that which stays and would prevent me from its enjoyment must also become its victim.” At this moment Munro returned with a lamp. The affrighted girl again appealed to him, but he heeded her not. He soon left the passage, and the outlaw proceeded:—“You love this youth—nay, shrink not back; let not your head droop in shame; he is worthy of your love, and for this among other things I hate him. He is worthy of the love of others, and for this too I hate him. Fool that you are, he cares not for you; spite of all your aid to-night, he will not remember you to-morrow—he has no thought of you—his hope is built upon—he is wedded to another. “Hear me, then—your life is in my hands, and at my mercy. There are none present who could interfere and arrest the blow. My dagger is even now upon your bosom—do you not feel it? At a word—a single suggestion of my thought—it performs its office, and for this night's defeat I am half revenged. You may arrest my arm—you may procure your release—even more—you may escape from the bondage of that union with me for which your uncle stands pledged, if you please.” “Speak—say—how!” was the eager exclamation of the maiden when this last suggestion met her ears. “Put me on the scent—say on what route have you sent this boy, that I may realize the revenge I so often dream of.” “Never, never, as I hope to live. I would rather you should strike me dead on the spot.” “Why, so I will,” he exclaimed, furiously, and his arm rose and the weapon descended, but he arrested the stroke as it approached her. “No—not yet. There will be time enough for this, and you will perhaps be more ready and resigned when I have got rid of this youth in whom you are so much interested. I need not disguise my purpose to you—you must have known it, when conspiring for its defeat; and now, Lucy, be assured, I shall not slumber in pursuit of him. I Vol. II.—D may be delayed, my revenge may be protracted, but I shall close with him at last. Withholding the clue which you may unfold cannot serve him very greatly; and having it in your hands, you may serve yourself and me. Take my offer—put me on his route, so that he shall not escape me, and be free henceforward from pursuit, or, as you phrase it, from persecution of mine.” “You offer highly, very highly, Guy Rivers, and I should be tempted to any thing save this. But I have not taken this step to undo it. I shall give you no clue, no assistance which may lead to crime and to the murder of the innocent. Release my hand, sir, and suffer me to retire.” “You have the means of safety and release in your own hands—a single condition complied with, and, so far as I am concerned, they are yours. Where is he gone—where secreted? What is the route which you have advised him to take. Speak, and to the point, Lucy Munro, for I may not longer be trifled with.” “He is safe, and by this time, I hope, beyond your reach. I tell you thus much, because I feel that it cannot yield you more satisfaction than it yields to me.” “It is in vain, woman, that you would trifle with and delay me: he cannot escape me in the end. All these woods are familiar to me, in night as in day, as the apartment in which we stand; and towards this boy I entertain a feeling which will endue me with an activity and energy as unshrinking in the pursuit as the appetite for revenge is keen which gives them birth and impulse. I hate him with a sleepless, an unforgiving hate, that cannot be quieted. He has dishonoured me in the presence of these men—he has been the instrument through which I bear this badge, this brand-stamp on my cheek—he has come between my passion and its object—nay, droop not—I have no reference now to you, though you, too, have been won by his insidious attractions, while he gives you no thought in return—he has done more than this, occasioned more than this, and wonder not that I had it in my heart at one moment to-night to put my dagger into your bosom, since through you it had been defrauded of its object. But why tremble—do you not tell me he is safe?” “I do—and for this reason I tremble. I tremble with joy, not fear. I rejoice that through my poor help he is safe. I did it all. I sought him—hear me, Guy Rivers, for in his safety I feel strong to speak—I sought him even in his chamber, and felt no shame—I led the way—I guided him through all the avenues of the house—when you ascended the stairs we stood over it in the closet which stands at its head. We beheld your progress—saw, and counted every step you took; heard every word you uttered; and, more than once, when your fiend soul spoke through your lips, in horrible threatenings, my hand arrested the weapon with which the youth whom you now seek would have sent you to your long account, with all your sins upon your head. I saved you from his blow; not because you deserved to live, but because, at that moment, you were too little prepared to die.” It would be difficult to imagine—certainly impossible to describe, the rage of Rivers, as, with an excited spirit, the young girl, still trembling, as she expressed it, from joy, not fear, avowed all the particulars of Colleton's escape. She proceeded with much of the fervour and manner of one roused into all the inspiration of a holy defiance of danger: “Wonder not, therefore, that I tremble—my soul is full of joy at his escape. I heed not the sneer and the sarcasm which is upon your lips and in your eyes. I went boldly and confidently even into the chamber of the youth—I aroused him from his slumbers—I defied, at that moment of peril, what were far worse to me than your suspicions—I defied such as might have been his. I was conscious of no sin—no improper thought— and I called upon God to protect and to sanction me in what I had undertaken. He has done so, and I bless him for the sanction.” She sank upon her knees as she spoke, and her lips murmured and parted as if in prayer, while the tears—tears of gladness—streamed warmly and abundantly from her eyes. The rage of the outlaw grew momently darker and less governable. The white foam collected about his mouth—while his hands, though still retaining their gripe upon hers, trembled almost as much as her own. He spoke in broken and bitter words. “And may God curse you for it. You have dared much, Lucy Munro, this hour. You have bearded a worse fury than the tiger thirsting after blood. What madness prompts you to this folly? You have heard me avow my utter, uncontrollable hatred of this man— my determination, if possible, to destroy him, and yet you interpose. You dare to save him in my defiance. You teach him our designs, and labour to thwart them yourself. Hear me, girl—you know me well—you know I never threaten without execution. I can understand how it is that a spirit, feeling at this moment as does your own, should defy death. But bethink you—is there nothing in your thought which is worse than death—from the terrors of which, the pure mind, however fortified by heroic resolution, must still shrink and tremble? Beware, then, how you chafe me. Say where the youth has gone, and in this way retrieve, if you can, the error which taught you to connive at his escape.” “I know not what you mean, and have no fears of any thing you can do. On this point I feel secure, and bid you defiance. To think now, that, having chiefly effected the escape of the youth, I would place him again within your power, argues a degree of stupidity in me that is wantonly insulting. I tell you he has fled—by this time—beyond your reach. I say no more. It is enough that he is in safety: before a word of mine puts him in danger, I'll perish by your hands or any hands.” “Then shall you perish, fool!” cried the ruffian, and his hand, hurried by the ferocious impulse of his rage, was again uplifted, when, in her struggles at freedom, a new object met his sight in the chain and portrait which Ralph had flung about her neck, and which, now falling from her bosom, arrested his attention, and seemed to awaken some recognition in his mind. His hold relaxed upon her arm, and with eager haste he seized the portrait, tearing it away with a single wrench from the rich chain to which it was appended, and which now in broken fragments was strewn upon the floor. Lucy sprang towards him convulsively, and vainly endeavoured at its recovery. Rivers broke the spring, and his eyes gazed with serpent-like fixedness upon the exquisitely beautiful features which it developed. His whole appearance underwent a change. The sternness had departed from his face, which now put on an air of abstraction and wandering not usually a habit with it. He gazed long and fixedly upon the portrait, unheeding the efforts of the girl to obtain it, and muttering at frequent intervals detached sentences, having little dependence upon one another:— “Ay—it is she,” he exclaimed—“true to the D 2 life—bright, beautiful, young, innocent—and I— But let me not think!” Then turning to the maid— “Fond fool—see you the object of adoration with him whom you so unprofitably adore. He loves her, girl—her—she, whom I—but why should I tell it you—is it not enough that we have both loved and loved in vain; and, in my revenge, you too shall acquire yours.” “I have nothing to revenge, Guy Rivers— nothing for you, above all others, to revenge. Give me the miniature; I have it in trust, and it must not go out of my possession.” She clung to him as she spoke, fruitlessly endeavouring at the recovery of that which he studiously kept from her reach. He parried her efforts for a while with something of forbearance; but ere long his original temper returned, and he exclaimed, with all the air of the demon— “Why will you tempt me, and why longer should I trifle? You cannot have the picture—it belongs, or should belong, as well as its original, to me. My concern is now with the robber from whom you obtained it. Will you not say upon what route he went? Will you not guide me—and, remember well—there are some terrors greater to your mind than any threat of death. Declare, for the last time—what road he took.” The maiden was still, and showed no sign of reply. Her eye wandered—her spirit was in prayer. She was alone with a ruffian, irresponsible and reckless, and she had many fears. “Will you not speak?” he cried—“then you must hear. Disclose the fact, Lucy—say, what is the road, or what the course you have directed for this youth's escape, or—” and stooping down he finished the sentence in the ears of the stunned and suffering girl. She started at the threat, for such it was, with undisguised horror. “Monster as you are—foul and ferocious you do but threaten, Guy Rivers—you would not dare such a thing!” The creeping terror of her voice, as she spoke, fully contradicted the confidence which her words expressed. “Ay, but by hell, and I dare even more!” was the instant response of the ruffian. “Then heaven be merciful to thee and me,” was all that she said, when she sank senselessly at his feet, just as his arms, with audacious grasp, were encircling her waist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “Oh, rate me as you will—I do not care— For I am stern and savage like yourself; But let your words to her fall on her ear Smoothly, as do young lovers' sentences, And yet be coy in this.” At this moment Munro re-entered the apartment, and his presence served to restrain the lawlessness of that fiercer passion which had no other restraint at that moment. The attention of the landlord was immediately called to the condition of his prostrate and much-abused niece; and reproving his companion for his violence, without comprehending or conjecturing its extent, he raised her carefully from the floor and seated her in a chair that stood in a corner of the apartment. But she seemed utterly unconscious all the while. Her nerves had received a shock which threatened to impair her senses. Her cheeks were cold and ashy—her lips were livid, and parted frequently as her teeth opened and shut with all the spasmodic energy of one suffering from ague. Once or twice her eyes brightened with the intelligence of returning consciousness; which, as Munro saw, he hurried his companion for the pursuit. It had now become a matter of stern necessity with himself to put on some degree of activity in the affair, since the flight of the youth indicated a knowledge of the design entertained against him, and, doubtless, of all the parties. Rivers, during all this time, seemed wrapped in thought; so much so, indeed, as now most strangely to need the promptings, rather than, as heretofore, the restraints of his companion, in the pursuit of blood. “Come, Guy—delay no longer. You little know Lucy if you think we shall get any thing out of her. You may strike, but you cannot make her speak where her mind's fixed. Where she's bent on a course, nothing can move her from it—'twas a trick of her father's—and I smack something of it myself. Nay, let go her hand—she must not be used roughly; for though she has stood in our way, she's a noble creature—too noble for us, by far, Guy—and must not be ill-treated.” “A plague on her nobility. Think you not she knows all our design, and has told it all to this boy. Would you believe it of her nobleness, that she has sought him this night in his chamber—led him forth—taught him our secret; and, sheltered in the closet above the stairway as we ascended, watched all our movements, and heard every thing we said. I told you that something was stirring, but you are duller than the owl.” “Well, it's too late now for talk. I've been out to the stable, and find his horse gone, saddle and bridle—at its entrance I found this dirk, which looks something like the one which he drew on you. He must have dropped it in bringing forth his horse.” “It is not too late—I know the woods well, and he does not. We must pursue. He will doubtless take one or other of the two traces at the fork, and his hoofs will soon tell us which. Our horses are refreshed by this, and are in readiness. You have pistols: see to the flints and priming. There must be no scruples now. The matter has gone quite too far for quiet, and though the affair was all mine at first, it is now as perfectly yours.” As Rivers spoke, Munro drew forth his pistols and looked carefuly at the priming. The sharp click of the springing steel, as the pan was thrown open, now fully aroused Lucy to that consciousness which had been only partial in the greater part of this dialogue. Springing to her feet, she rushed forward to her uncle, and looked appealingly into his face, though she did not speak, while her hand grasped tenaciously his arm. “What means the girl?—” exclaimed Munro, now apprehensive of some mental derangement. She spoke, with a solemn emphasis, but a single sentence:— “It is written—thou shalt do no murder!” The solemn tone—the sudden, the almost fierce action, the peculiar abruptness of the apostrophe— the whitely robed, the almost spiritual elevation of figure—all so dramatic—combined necessarily to startle and surprise; and, for a few moments, no answer was returned to the unlooked-for speech. But the effect could not be permanent upon minds made familiar with the thousand forms of human and strong energies. Munro, after a brief pause, replied— “Who speaks of murder, girl? Why this wild, this uncalled-for exhortation?” “Not wild, not uncalled-for, uncle, but most necessary. Wherefore would you pursue the youth —arms in your hands, hatred in your heart, and horrible threatenings upon your lips. Why put yourself into the hands of this fierce monster, as the sharp instrument, to do his vengeance and gratify his savage malignity against the young and the gentle. If you would do no murder—not so he. He will do it—he will make you do it—but he will have it done. Approach me not—approach me not—let me die, rather, Oh God—my uncle, let him come not near me if you would not see me die upon the spot—” she exclaimed, in the most terrified manner, and with a shuddering horror as Rivers, towards the conclusion of her speech, had advanced towards her with the view to an answer. To her uncle she again addressed herself, with an energy which gave additional emphasis to her language:— “Uncle—you are my father now—you will not forget the dying prayer of a brother. My prayer is his. Keep that man from me—let me not see him—let him come not near me with his polluted and polluting breath. You know not what he is— you know him but as a stabber—as a hater—as a thief! But were my knowledge yours—could I utter in your ears the foul language—the fiend-threatenings which his accursed lips uttered in mine,—but no—save me from him is all I ask— protect the poor orphan—the feeble, the trampled child of your brother. Keep me from the presence of that bad man!” As she spoke, she sank at the feet of the person she addressed—her hands were clasped about his knees, and she lay there shuddering and shrinking, until he lifted her up in his arms. Somewhat softened by his kindness of manner, the pressure upon her brain of that ague-agony was immediately relieved, and a succession of tears and sobs marked the diminished influence of her terrors. But, as Rivers attempted something in reply, she started— “Let me go—let me not hear him speak. His breath is pollution—his words are full of foul threats and dreadful thoughts. If you knew all that I know—if you feared what I fear, uncle— you would nigh slay him on the spot.” This mental suffering of his niece was not without its influence upon her uncle; who, as we have said before, had a certain kind and degree of pride —pride of character, we may almost call it—not inconsistent with pursuits and a condition of life wild and wicked even as his. His eye sternly settled upon that of his companion, as, without a word, he bore the almost lifeless girl into the chamber of his wife, who, aroused by the clamour, now and then looked forth upon the scene, but was too much the creature of timidity to venture entirely amid the disputants. Placing her under the charge of the old lady, he uttered a few consolatory words in her ear, but she heard him not. Her thoughts evidently wandered to other than selfish considerations at that moment, and as he left the chamber, she raised her finger impressively—“Do no murder, uncle—let him not persuade you into crime—break off from a league which compels you to brook a foul insult to those you are bound in duty to protect.” “Would I could!” was his muttered sentence as he left the chamber. He felt the justice of the counsel, but wore the bewildered expression of countenance of one conscious of what is right, but wanting courage for its adoption. “She has told you no foolish story of me?” was the somewhat anxious speech of Rivers upon the reappearance of the landlord. “She has said nothing in words, Guy Rivers— but much in look, that made me doubt whether you, and not this boy we pursue, should not have my weapon in your throat. But, beware! The honour of that child of Edgar Munro is to me what would have been my own; and let me find that you have gone a little beyond the permitted point in speech or action, and we cut asunder. I shall then make as little bones of putting a bullet through your ribs as into those of the wild bullock of the hills. I am what I am—my hope is that she may always be the pure creature which she now is, if it were only that she might pray for me.” “She has mistaken me, Munro—” “Say no more, Guy. She has not much mistaken you, or I have. Let us say no more on this subject—you know my mind, and will be advised—let us now be off. The horses are in readiness and waiting, and a good spur will bring us with the game. The youth, you say, has money about him, a gold watch, and—” “Yes—all—but what of that? Are there more scruples now?” “No, no!” and the fierce superiority of Rivers in all matters of crime over his companion, was manifested in this single sentence—“but, to strike, and strike for nothing, you know, is scarcely wisdom.” “We do not strike for nothing, even though no money come of it. I do not, at least—” was the half-muttered reply of Rivers, as the two proceeded into the court in the rear of the building, where their horses were in waiting. In a few moments they were in full speed over the hard and stony road, with different emotions in their bosoms, yet both with the same object.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. —“Wretch! what art thou about? * * * * * 'tis now upon the stroke— A hand is stretch'd out, and another too! As though it were a grasping. Look, look, look!” “His black branching horns have received the death stroke, He sprawls and falls headlong.” Symmons' Eschylus —Cassandra. We have witnessed the departure of our friend Forrester from the place of his trysting. He went forth with renewed confidence in the future, and with a strong sentiment of hope enkindled in his bosom. His course lay for the deep west—the unopened forests and mighty waters of the Mississippi valley. The sting was somewhat taken from his conscience, and with a renewed desire of life, and warmly anticipating its enjoyments, he began to find, as he rode quietly along under the light of the moon and through the bending foliage, numberless apologies for his offences. The condition of things generally underwent a change strictly corresponding with that in the favour of his affections. “But who shall ride from his destiny?” saith the proverb. The wing of the bird is no security against the shaft of the fowler, and the helmet and the shield keep not away the Vol. II.—E draught that is poisoned. He who wears the greaves, the gorget and the coat of mail, holds defiance to the storm of battle; but he drinks and dies in the hall of banqueting. What matters it, too, though the eagle soars and screams among the clouds, half way up to heaven—flaunting his proud pinions, and glaring with audacious glance in the very eye of the sun—death waits for him in the quiet of his own aerie, nestling with his brood. These are the goodly texts of that Arabian sage, in whose garden-tree, so much was he the beloved of heaven, the birds came and nightly sang for him those solemn truths—those lessons of a perfect wisdom—which none but the favoured of the Deity are ever permitted to hear. They will find a sufficient commentary in the fortune of the rider whom we have just beheld setting out from his parting with his mistress, on his way of new adventure—his heart comparatively light, and his spirit made buoyant with the throng of pleasant fancies which continually gathered about his thoughts. The interview between Forrester and his mistress had been somewhat protracted, and his route from her residence to the road in which we find him, being somewhat circuitous, the night had waned considerably in advance of his progress. He now rode carelessly, as one who mused—his horse, not urged by its rider, became somewhat careful of his vigour, and his gait was moderated much from that which had marked his outset. He had not long entered upon the trace through the thick wood, when the sound of other hoofs came down upon the wind; not to his ears, for, swallowed up in his own meditations, his senses had lost much of their wonted acuteness. He had not been long gone from the point of road in which we have thought proper to find him, when his place upon the same route was supplied by the pursuing party, Rivers and Munro. They were both admirably mounted, but seemed little to regard, in their manner of using them, the value of the good beasts which they bestrode—driving them as they did, resolutely over fallen trees and jutting rocks, their sides already dashed with foam, and the flanks bloody with the repeated application of the rowel. It was soon evident that farther pursuit at such a rate would be impossible; and Munro, as well for the protection of the horses, as with the knowledge of this necessity, insisted upon a more moderated and measured pace. Much against his own will, Rivers assented, though his impatience frequently found utterance in words querulously sarcastic. The love of gain was a besetting sin of the landlord, and it was by this passion that his accomplice found it easy, on most occasions, to defeat the suggestions of his better judgment. The tauntings of the former, therefore, were particularly bestowed upon this feature in his character, as he found himself compelled to yield to the requisition of the latter, with whom the value of the horses was no small consideration. “Well, well,” said Rivers, “if you say so, it must be so; though I am sure, if we push briskly ahead, we shall find our bargain in it. You too will find the horse of the youth, upon which you had long since set your eyes and heart, a full equivalent, even if we entirely ruin the miserable beasts we ride.” “The horse you ride is no miserable beast,” retorted the landlord, who had some of the pride of a southron in this particular, and seemed solicitous for the honour of his stud—“you have jaded him by your furious gait, and seem entirely insensible to the fact that our progress for the last half hour, continued much longer, would knock up any animal. I'm not so sure, too, Guy, that we shall find the youngester, or that we shall be able to get our own bargain out of him when found. He's a tough colt, I take it, and will show fight unless you surprise him.” “Stay—hear you nothing now, as the wind sets up from below? Was not that the tramping of a horse?” They drew up cautiously as the inquiry was put by Rivers, and pausing for a few minutes, listened attentively. Munro dismounted, and laying his ear to the ground, endeavoured to detect and distinguish the distant sounds, which, in that way, may be heard with far greater readiness; but he arose without being satisfied. “You hear nothing?” “Not a sound but that which we make ourselves. Your ears to-night are marvellous quick, but they catch nothing. This is the third time to-night you have fancied sounds, and heard what I could not; and I claim to have senses in quite as high perfection as your own.” “And without doubt you have; but, know you not, Munro, that wherever the passions are concerned, the senses become so much more acute; and, indeed, are so many sentinels and spies— scouring about perpetually, and with this advantage over all other sentinels, that they then never slumber. So, whether one hates or loves, the ear and the eye take heed of all that is going on—they minister to the prevailing passion, and seem, in their own exercise, to acquire some of the motive and impulse which belongs to it.” “I believe this in most respects to be the case. I have observed it on more than one occasion myself, and in my own person. But, Guy, in all that you have said, and all that I have seen, I do not yet understand why it is that you entertain such a mortal antipathy to this young man, more than to many others who have at times crossed your path. I now understand the necessity for putting him out of the way; but this is another matter. Before we thought it possible that he could injure us, you had the same violent hatred, and would have destroyed him at the first glance. There is more in this, Guy, than you have been willing to let out; and I look upon it as strange, to say nothing more, that I should be kept so much in the dark upon the subject.” Rivers smiled grimly at the inquiry, and replied at once, though with evident insincerity,— “Perhaps my desire to get rid of him then, arose from a presentiment that we should have to do it in the end. You know I have a gift of foreseeing and foretelling.” “This won't do for me, Guy; I know you too well to regard you as one likely to be influenced by notions of this nature—you must put me on some other scent.” “Why, so I would, Wat, if I were assured that I myself knew the precise impulse which sets me on this work. But the fact is, my hate to the boy springs from certain influences which may not be defined by name—which grow out of those moral mysteries of our nature, for which we can scarcely account to ourselves; and, by the operation of which, we are led to the performance of things without seemingly any adequate cause or necessity. A few reflections might give you the full force of this. Why do some men shrink from a cat? There is an instance now in John Bremer; a fellow, you know, who would make no more ado about exchanging rifle shots with his enemy at twenty E 2 paces, than at taking dinner; yet a black cat throws him into fits, from which for two days he never perfectly recovers. Again—there are some persons to whom the perfume of flowers brings sickness, and the song of a bird sadness. How are we to account for all these things, unless you do so by a reference to the peculiar make of the man? In this way you may understand why it is that I hate this boy, and would destroy him. He is my black cat, and his presence for ever throws me into fits.” “I have heard of the things of which you speak, and have known some of them myself; but I never could believe that nature had been the occasion. I was always inclined to think that circumstances in childhood, of which the recollection is forgotten—such as great and sudden fright to the infant, or a blow which affected the brain, were the operating influences. All these things, however, only affect the fancies—they beget fears and notions—never deep and abiding hatred—unquiet passion, and long-treasured malignity, such as I find in you on this occasion.” “Upon this point, Munro, you may be correct. I do not mean to say that hatred and a desire to destroy are consequent to antipathies such as you describe; but still, something may be said in favour of such a notion. It appears to me but natural to seek the destruction of that which is odious or irksome to any of our senses. Why do you crush the crawling spider with your heel?—You fear not its venom—inspect it, and the mechanism of its make, the architecture of its own fabrication, are, to the full, as wonderful as any thing within your comprehension; but yet, without knowing why, with an impulse given you, as it would seem, from infancy, you seek its destruction with a persevering industry, which might lead one to suppose you had in view your direst enemy.” “This is all very true—and from infancy up we do this thing, but the cause cannot be in any loathsomeness which its presence occasions in your mind, for we perceive the same boy destroying with measured tortures the gaudiest butterfly which his hat can encompass.” “Non sequitur,” said Rivers. “What's that? some of your d—d law gibberish, I suppose. If you want me to talk with you at all, Guy, you must speak in a language I understand.” “Why, so I will, Wat. I only meant to say, in a phrase common to the law, and which your friend Pippin makes use of a dozen times a day, that it did not follow, from what you said, that the causes which led to the death of the spider and the butterfly were the same. This we may know by the manner in which they are respectively destroyed. The boy, with much precaution and an aversion he does not seek to disguise, in his attempts on the spider, employs his shoe or a stick for the purpose of slaughter. But, with the butterfly, the case is altogether different. He first catches, and does not fear to hold it in his hand. He inspects it closely, and proceeds to analyze that which his young thought has already taught him is a beautiful creation of the insect world. He strips it, wing by wing, of its gaudy covering; and then, with a feeling of ineffable scorn, that so wealthy a noble should go unarmed and unprotected, he dashes him to the ground, and terminates his sufferings without farther scruple. The spider, having a sting, he is compelled to fear, and consequently taught to respect. The feelings are all perfectly natural, however, which prompt his proceedings. The curiosity is common and innate which impels him to the inspection of the inspection of the insect; and that feeling is equally a natural impulse which prompts him to the death of the spider without hesitation. So with me—it is enough that I hate this boy, though possessed of numberless attractions of mind and person. Shall I do him the kindness to inquire whether there be reason for the mood which prompts me to destroy him?” “You were always too much for me, Guy, at this sort of argument, and you talk the matter over ingeniously enough, I grant; but still I am not satisfied, that a mere antipathy, without show of reason, originally induced your dislike to this young man. When you first sought to do him up, you were conscious of this, and gave, as a reason for the desire, the cut upon your face, which so much disfigured your loveliness.” Rivers did not appear very much to relish or regard this speech, which had something of satire in it; but he was wise enough to restrain his feelings, as, reverting back to their original topic, he spoke in the following manner:— “You are unusually earnest after reasons and motives for action, to-night: is it not strange, Munro, that it has never occasioned surprise in your mind, that one like myself, so far superior in numerous respects to the men I have consented to lead and herd with, should have made such my profession?” “Not at all,” was the immediate and ready response of his companion. “Not at all. This was no mystery to me, for I very well knew that you had no choice, no alternative. What else could you have done? Outlawed and under sentence, I knew that you could never return, in any safety or security, whatever might be your disguise, to the society which had driven you out—and I'm sure that your chance would be but a bad one were you to seek a return to the old practice at Gwinnett court-house. Any attempt there to argue a fellow out of the halter would be only to argue yourself into it.” “Pshaw, Munro—that is the case now—that is the necessity and difficulty of to-day. But where, and what was the necessity, think you, when, in the midst of good practice at Gwinnett bar, where I ruled without competitor, riding roughshod over bench, bar, and jury, dreaded alike by all, I threw myself into the ranks of these men, and put on their habits? I speak not now in praise of myself, more than the facts, as you yourself know them, will sufficiently warrant. I am now above those idle vanities which would make me deceive myself as to my own mental merits; but, that such was my standing there and then, I hold indisputable.” “It is true. I sometimes look back at the manner in which you used to bully the old judge and the gaping jury and your own brother lawyers, while the foam would run through your clenched teeth and from your lips in very passion; and then I wondered, when you were doing so well, that you ever gave up there, to undertake a business the very first job in which put your neck in danger.” “You may well wonder, Munro—I could not well explain the mystery to myself, were I to try; and it is this which made the question and doubt which we set out to explain. To those who knew me well from the first, it is not matter of surprise that I should be for ever in excitements of one kind or another. From my childhood up, my temper was of a restless and unquiet character—I was always a peevish, a fretful and discontented person, I looked with scorn and contempt upon the humdrum ways of those about me, and longed for perpetual change, and wild and fruitful circumstance. My passions, always fretful and excitable, were never satisfied except when I was employed in some way which enabled me to feed and keep alive the irritation which was their and my very breath of life. With such a spirit, how could I be what men style and consider a good man? What folly to expect it. Virtue is but a sleepy, indoor, domestic quality—inconsistent with enterprise or great activity. There are no drones so perfect in the world as the true orthodox. It is for this reason, and from this cause, that a great man is seldom, if ever, a good one. It is inconsistent with the very nature of things to expect it, unless it be from a co-operation of singular circumstances, whose return is with the comets. Vice, on the contrary, is endowed with strong passions—a feverish thirst after forbidden fruits and waters—a bird-nesting propensity, that carries it away from the haunts of the crowded city, into strange wilds and interminable forests. It lives upon adventure—it counts its years by incidents, and has no other mode of computing time or of enjoying life. This fact— and it is undeniable with respect to both the parties—will furnish a sufficient reason why the best heroes of the best poets are always great criminals. Were this not the case, from what would the interest be drawn?—where would be the incident, if all men, pursuing the quiet paths of non-interference with the rights, the lives, or the liberties of one another, spilt no blood, invaded no territory, robbed no lord of his lady, enslaved and made no captives in war? A virtuous hero would be a useless personage both in play and poem—and the spectator or reader would fall asleep over the utterance of stale apothegms. What writer of sense, for instance, would dream of bringing up George Washington to figure in either of these forms before the world—and how, if he did so, would he prevent reader or auditor from getting excessively tired, and perhaps disgusted, with one, whom all men are now agreed to regard as the hero of civilization? Nor do I utter sentiments which are subjects either of doubt or disputation. I could put the question in such a form as would bring the million to agree with me. Look, for instance, at the execution of a criminal. See the thousands that will assemble, day after day, after travelling miles for that single object, to gape and gaze upon the last agonizing pangs and paroxysms of a fellow-creature—not regarding for an instant the fatigue of their position, the press of the crowd, or the loss of a dinner —totally unsusceptible, it would seem, of the several influences of heat and cold, wind and rain, which at any other time would have driven them to their beds or firesides. The same motive which provokes this desire in the spectator, is the parent, to a certain extent, of the very crime which has led to the exhibition. It is the morbid appetite, which sometimes grows to madness—the creature of unregulated passions, ill judged direction, and sometimes, even of the laws and usages of society itself, which is so much interested in the promotion of characteristics the very reverse. It may be that I have more of this perilous stuff about me than the generality of mankind; but I am satisfied there are few of them, taught as I have been, and the prey of like influences, whose temper had been very different from mine. The early and operating circumstances under which I grew up, all tended to the rank growth and encouragement of the more violent and vexing passions. I was the victim of a tyranny, which, in the end, made me too a tyrant. To feel myself and exercise the temper thus taught me, I had to acquire power in order to secure victims; and all my aims in life, all my desires, tended to this one pursuit. Indifferent to me, alike, the spider who could sting, or the harmless butterfly whose only offensiveness is in the folly of his wearing a glitter which he cannot take care of. I was a merciless enemy, giving no quarter; and with an Ishmaelitish spirit, lifting my hand against all the tribes that were buzzing around me.” “I believe you have spoken the truth, Guy, so far as your particular qualities of temper are concerned; for, had I undertaken to have spoken for you in relation to this subject, I should probably have said, though not to the same degree, the same thing; but the wonder with me is, how, with such feelings, you should have so long remained in quiet, and in some respects, perfectly harmless.” “There is as little mystery in the one as in the other. You may judge that my sphere of action— speaking of action in a literal sense—was rather circumscribed at Gwinnett court-house: but, the fact is, I was then but acquiring my education. I was, for the first time, studying men, and the study of rogues is not unaptly fitted to make one take up the business. I found it to have that effect. But, even at Gwinnett court-house—learning, as I did, and what I did, there was one passion, or perhaps a modified form of the ruling passion, which might have swallowed up all the rest had time been allowed it. I was young, and not free from vanity—particularly as, for the first time, my ears had been won with praise and gentle flatteries. The possession of early, and afterwards undisputed talents, acquired for me deference and respect; and I was soon tempted to desire the applauses of the swinish multitude, and to feel a thirsting after public distinction. In short, I grew ambitious. I soon became sick and tired of the applauses, the fame, of my own ten-mile horizon: its origin seemed equivocal—its worth and quality questionable, at the best. My spirit grew troubled with a wholesale discontent, and roved in search of a wider field—a more elevated and extensive empire. But how could I—the petty lawyer of a county court, in the midst of a wilderness, appropriate time, find means and opportunities even for travel? I was poor, and profits are few to a small lawyer, whose best cases are paid for by a bale of cotton or a negro, when both of them are down in the market. In vain, and repeatedly, did I struggle with circumstances that for ever foiled me in my desires; until, in a rash and accursed hour, when chance, and you, and the devil, threw the opportunity for crime in my path! It did not escape me, and—but you know the rest.” “I do—but would rather hear you tell it. When you speak thus, you put me in mind of some of the stump speeches you used to make, when you ran for the Legislature.” “Ay,—that was another, and not the least of the many reverses which my ambition was doomed to meet with. You knew the man who opposed me—you know that a more shallow and insignificant fop and fool never yet dared to thrust his head into a deliberative assembly. But, he was rich, and I poor. He a potato, the growth of the soil;—I, though generally admitted a plant of more promise and pretension,—I was an exotic! He was a patrician—one of the small nobility—a growth, sui generis, of the place—” “Damn your Latin;—stop with that, if you please.” “Well, well!—he was one of the great men, I was a poor plebeian, whose chief misfortune, at Vol. II.—F that time, consisted in my not having a father or a great grandfather a better man than myself! His money did the work, and I was bought and beat out of my election, which I considered certain. I then acquired a knowledge of two things. I learned duly to estimate the value of the democratic principle, when I beheld the vile slaves, whose votes his money had commanded, laughing in scorn at the miserable creature they had themselves put over them. They felt not—not they—the double shame of their doings. They felt that he was King Log, but never dreamt that they were his subjects. This taught me, too, the value of money —its wonderful magic and mystery. In the mood occasioned by all these things, you found me, for the first time, and in a ready temper for any villany. You attempted to console me for my defeats, but I heard you not until you spoke of revenge! I was not then to learn how to be vindictive:—I had always been so. I knew, by instinct, how to lap blood—you only taught me how to scent it! My first great crime proved my nature. Performed under your direction, though without your aid, it was wantonly cruel in its execution, since the prize desired might readily have been obtained without the life of its possessor. You, more merciful than myself, would have held me back, and arrested my stroke; but that would have been taking from the repast its finish—the pleasure, for it was such to me in my condition of mind, would have been lost entirely. It may sound strangely even in your ears when I say so, but I could no more have kept my knife from that man's throat, than I could have taken wing for the heavens. He was a poor coward,—made no struggle, and begged most piteously for his life —had the audacity to talk of his great possessions, his rank in society, his wife and children—these were enjoyments all withheld from me—these were the very things the want of which had made me what I was—what I am—and furiously I struck my weapon into his mouth, silencing his insulting speech. Should such a mean spirit as his have joys which were denied to me?—I spurned his quivering carcass with my foot. At that moment, I felt myself:—I had something to live for. I knew my appetite, and felt that it was native. I had acquired a knowledge of a new luxury, and ceased to wonder at the crimes of a Nero and a Caligula. Think you, Munro, that the thousands who assemble at the execution of a criminal trouble themselves to inquire into the merits of his case—into the justice of his death and punishment? Ask they whether he is the victim of justice or of tyranny? No!—they go to see a show—they love blood, and in this way have the enjoyment furnished to their hands, without the risk which must follow the shedding of it for themselves.” “There is one thing, Guy, upon which I never thought to ask you. What became of that beautiful young girl from Carolina, on a visit to the village, when you lost your election? You were then cavorting about her in great style, and I could see that you were well-nigh as much mad after her as upon the loss of the seat.” Rivers started at the inquiry in astonishment or anger, and for a few moments gave no reply. He soon recovered himself, however; for, though at times exhibiting the passions of a demoniac, he was too much of a proficient not to be able, in the end, to command the coolness of the villain. “I had thought to have said nothing on this subject, Munro, but there are few things which escape your observation. In replying to you on this point, you will now have all the mystery explained of my rancorous pursuit of this boy. That girl— then a mere girl—refused me, as perhaps you know; and when, heated with wine and irritated with rejection, I pressed the point rather too warmly, she treated me with contempt and withdrew from the apartment. This youth is the favoured—the successful rival:—he was but a boy then—but I knew him, and saw then, what neither of them saw, that they loved each other. Look upon this picture, Walter—now, while the moon streams through these branches upon it, and wonder not that it maddened, and still maddens me, to think, that for his smooth face, and stern affectation of superiority, I was to be sacrificed and despised. She was probably a year older than himself: but I saw at the time, though both of them appeared unconscious of the fact, that she loved him then. What with her rejection and scorn, coming at the same time with my election defeat, I am what I am. These defeats were wormwood to my soul; and, if I am criminal, the parties concerned in them have been the cause of the crime.” “How do you make that out? I do not understand you.” “Very likely—you are not alone. The million would say with yourself. But hear the case as I put it, and not as it is put by the majority. Providence endowed me with a certain superiority of mind over my fellows. I had capacities which they had not—talents to which they did not aspire, and the possession of which they readily conceded to me. These talents fitted me for certain stations in society, to which, as I had the talents pre-eminently for such stations, the inference is fair that Providence intended me for some such station. But I was denied my place. Society, guilty of favouritism and prejudice, gave to others, not so well fitted as myself for its purposes or necessities, the station in all particulars designed for me. I was denied my birthright, and rebelled. Can society complain, when prostituting herself and depriving me of my rights, that I resisted her usurpation and denied her authority. Shall she, doing wrong herself in the first instance, undertake to punish? Surely not. My rights were admitted—my superior capacity;—but the people were rotten to the core—they had not even the virtue of truth to themselves. They made their own governors of the vilest and the worst. They willingly became slaves, and are punished in more ways than one. They first create the tyrants—for tyrants are the creatures of the people they sway, and never make themselves—they next drive into banishment their more legitimate rulers; and the consequence, in the third place, is, that they make enemies of those whom they exile. Such is the case with me, and such —But hark! That surely is the tread of a horse. Do you hear it? there is no mistake now—” and as he spoke, the measured trampings were heard resounding at some distance seemingly in advance of them. “We must now use the spur, Munro—your horses have had indulgence enough for the last hour, and we may tax them a little now.” “Well, push on as you please—but do you know any thing of this route, and what course will you pursue in doing him up?” “Leave all that to me—as for the route, it is an old acquaintance, and the blaze on this tree reminds me that we can here have a short cut which will carry us at a good sweep round this hill, bringing us upon the main trace, about two miles further down. We must take this course, and spur on, that we may F 2 get ahead of him, and be quietly stationed when he comes. We shall gain it, I am confident, before our man, who seems to be taking it easily. He will have three miles at the least to go, and over a road that will keep him in a walk half the way. We shall be there in time.” They reached the point proposed in due season; their victim had not yet made his appearance, and they had sufficient time for all their arrangements. The place was one well calculated for the successful accomplishment of a deed of darkness. The road at the foot of the hill narrowed into a path scarcely wide enough for the passage of a single horseman. The shrubbery and copse on either side overhung it; and in many places were so thickly interwoven, that when, as at intervals of the night, the moon shone out among the thick and broken clouds, which hung upon and mostly obscured her course, her scattered rays scarcely penetrated the dense enclosure. At length the horseman approached and in silence. Descending the hill, his motion was slow and tedious—he entered the fatal avenue, and, when in the midst of it, Rivers started from the side of his comrade, and advancing under the shelter of a tree, a waited his progress. He came—no word was spoken—a single stroke was given, and the horseman, throwing up his hands, grasped the limb which projected over, while his horse passed from under him. He held on for a moment to the branch, while a groan of deepest agony, mental as well as physical, broke from his lips, when he fell supine to the ground. At that moment, the moon shone forth unimpeded and unobscured by a single cloud. The person of the wounded man was fully apparent to the sight. He struggled, but spoke not; and the hand of Rivers was again uplifted, when Munro rushed forward. “Stay—away, Guy—we are mistaken—this is not our man.” The victim heard the words, and, with something like an effort at a laugh, though seemingly in great pain, exclaimed— “Ah, Munro, is that you?—I am so glad; but I'm afraid you come too late. This is a sad jest!” It was Forrester who spoke, and Munro would have saved him; but Rivers, who had done himself no injustice in the narrative which we have already heard, rejected the more merciful suggestion. The wounded man saw his action and heard the controversy, and the few words he was enabled to utter were those of prayer and entreaty. “Save me, Wat—he will strike again—I have done you no harm—I will do you none—and— would live, Wat—would live—happy—Kate.” He threw up his hands with fearful energy as he beheld his murderer—from whom Munro had wrested the weapon originally used—aiming a second blow with the small hatchet which he always wore. The interposition of Munro was without avail; the sharp steel drove through, separating the extended fingers of the fallen man as he threw them up, and crushing and crunching deeply into the scull. The unhappy woodman sank back, without groan or further word, even as an ox beneath the stunning stroke of the butcher.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “A rash and ruinous deed. Thou art too quick; Thy madness blinds thee, and thy rude stroke falls Wide of the victim.” There was the pause of a moment, after the deed, in which no word was spoken. The murderer at length, with the utmost composure, wiping his bloody weapon upon the long grass on the road side, interrupted a silence which was certainly painful to the landlord, if not to himself, by exclaiming— “Well, Munro, so far our ride has been for nothing, and so much time has been lost already, that I fear it is now hopeless to attempt further pursuit of the boy, at least for to-night. What say you?” The person addressed did not reply to the interrogatory, but in a language the result of a different course of thought, he returned,— “It will be no wonder, Guy, if the whole country turns out upon us. You are too wanton in your doings. Wherefore, when I told you of your error, did you strike the poor wretch again.” The landlord, it will be seen, spoke simply with reference to policy and expediency, and deserves as little credit for humanity as the individual he rebuked. In this particular lay the difference between them. Both were equally ruffianly, but the one had less of passion, less of feeling, and more of profession in the matter. With the other, the trade of crime was adopted strictly in subservience to the dictates of ill-regulated desires and emotions, suffering defeat in their hope of indulgence, and stimulating to a morbid action which became a disease. The references of Munro were always addressed to the petty gains; and the miserly nature, thus perpetually exhibiting itself, at the expense of all other emotions, was, in fact, the true influence which subjected him almost to the sole dictation of his accomplice—in whom a somewhat lofty distaste for such a peculiarity had occasioned a manner and habit of mind, the superiority of which was readily felt by the other. “Why strike again?” was the response of Rivers. “You talk like a child. Would you have him live to blab? Saw you not that he knew us both? Are you so green as to think, if suffered to escape, his tongue or hands would have been idle? You should know better. But the fact is, he could not have lived. The first blow was fatal; and, if I had deliberated for an instant, I should have followed the suggestions of your humanity—I should have withheld the second, which merely terminated his agony.” “It was a rash deed, and I would we had made sure of your man before blindly rushing into these unnecessary risks.” “Your scruples and complainings, Wat, remind me of that farm-yard philosopher, who always locked the door of his stable after the steed had been stolen. You have your sermon ready in time for the funeral, but not during the life for whose benefit you make it. But whose fault was it that we followed the wrong game. Did you not make certain of the fresh track at the fork, so that there was no doubting you?” “I did—there was a fresh track, and our coming upon Forrester proves it. There may have been another on the other prong of the fork, and doubtless the youth we pursue has taken it; but you were in such an infernal hurry that I had scarce time to find out what I did.” “Well, you will preach no more on the subject. We have failed, and accounting for won't mend the failure. As for this bull-headed fellow, he deserves his fate for his old insolence. He was for ever putting himself in my way, and may not complain that I have at last put him out of it. But come, we have no further need to remain here, though just as little to pursue further in the present condition of our horses.” “What shall we do with the body? we cannot leave it here.” “Why not?—What should we do with it, I pray? The wolves may want a dinner to-morrow, and I would be charitable. Yet stay—where is the youth's dirk which you found at the stable? Give it me.” “What would you do?” “You shall see. Forrester's horse is off—fairly frightened, and will take the route back to the old range. He will doubtless go to old Walton's clearing, and carry the first news. There will be a search, and when they find the body, they will not overlook the weapon, which I shall place beside it. There will then be other pursuers than me—and if it brings the boy to the gallows, I shall not regret our mistake to-night.” As he spoke, he received the dagger, the sheath of which he threw at some distance in advance upon the road, while he smeared the blade with the blood, now fast coagulating, of the murdered man, which still, however, continued to trickle from the body. “You are well taught in the profession, Guy, and, if you would let me, I would leave it off, if for no other reason than the very shame of being so much outdone in it. But we may as well strip him. If his gold is in his pouch, it will be a spoil worth the taking, for he has been melting and running for several days past at Murkey's furnace.” Rivers turned away, and the feeling which his countenance exhibited might have been that of disdainful contempt as he replied— “Take it, if you please—I am in no want of his money. My object was not his robbery.” The scorn was seemingly understood; for, without proceeding to do as he proposed, Munro retained his position for a few moments, appearing to busy himself with the bridle of his horse, having adjusted which he returned to his companion. “Well, are you ready for a start. We have a good piece to ride, and should be in motion. We have both of us much to do in the next three days, or rather nights; and need not hesitate what to take hold of first. The court will sit on Monday, and if you are determined to stand and see it out —a plan I don't altogether like—why, we must prepare to get rid of such witnesses as we may think likely to become troublesome.” “That matter will be seen to. I have ordered Dillon to have ten men in readiness, if need be for so many, to carry off Pippin, and a few others, till the adjournment. It will be a dear jest to the lawyer, and one not less novel than terrifying to him, to miss a court under such circumstances. I take it, he has never been absent from a session for twenty years; for, if sick before, he is certain to get well in time for business, spite of his physician.” The grim smile which disfigured still more the visage of Rivers at the ludicrous association which the proposed abduction of the lawyer awakened in his mind, was reflected fully back from that of his companion, whose habit, however, in this respect, was more notorious for gravity than any other less stable expression. He carried out in words the fancied occurrence, described the lawyer as raving over his undocketed and unargued cases, and the numberless embryos lying composedly in his pigeon-holes, awaiting, with praiseworthy patience, the moment when they should take upon them a local habitation and a name; while he, upon whom they so much depended, was fretting with unassuaged fury in the constraints of his prison, and the absence from that scene of his repeated triumphs which before had never been at a loss for his presence. “But, come—let us mount,” said the landlord, who did not feel much disposed to lose much, if any time for a jest. “There is much more than this to be done yet in the village; and, I take it, you feel in no disposition to waste more time to-night. Let us be off.” “So say I, but I go not back with you to-night, Wat. I strike across the woods into the other road, where I have much to see to; besides going down the branch to Dixon's Ford, and Wolf's Neck, where I must see our men and have them ready. I shall not be in the village, therefore, until late to-morrow night, if then.” “What—you are for the cross-roads, again,” said Munro. “I tell you what, Guy, you must have done with that girl before Lucy shall be yours. It's bad enough—bad enough that she should be compelled to look to you for love. It were a sad thing if the little she might expect were to be divided between two or more.” “Pshaw—you are growing Puritan because of the dark. I tell you I have done with her. I cannot altogether forget what she was, nor what I have made her; and just at this time she is in need of my assistance. Good-night! I shall see Dillon and the rest of them by morning, and prepare for the difficulty. My disguise shall be complete, and if you are wise you will see to your own. I would not think of flight, for much may be made out of the country, and I know of none better for our purposes. Good-night!” Thus saying, the outlaw struck into the forest, and Munro, lingering until he was fairly out of sight and hearing, proceeded to rifle the person of Forrester—an act which the disdainful manner and language of his companion had made him hitherto forbear. The speech of Rivers on this subject had been felt; and, taken in connexion with the air of authority which the natural mental superiority of the latter had necessarily imparted to his address, there was much in it highly offensive to the less adventurous ruffian. A few moments sufficed to effect the lightening of the woodman's purse of the earnings which had been so essential a feature in his dreams of cottage happiness; and while engaged in this transfer, the discontent of the landlord occasionally broke out into words— “He carries himself highly, indeed; and we who are his agents and aids must stand reproved whenever it pleases his humour. Well! I am in for it now, and there is no chance of my getting safely out of the scrape just at this moment; but the day will come, and, by God, I will have a settlement that'll go near draining his heart of all the blood in it.” As he spoke in bitterness, he approached his horse, and flinging the bridle over his neck, was in a little while a good distance on his way from the scene of blood, over which Silence now folded her Vol. II.—G wings, brooding undisturbed, as if nothing had taken place below; so little is the sympathy which the transient and inanimate nature at any time exhibits, with that, to the enjoyment of which it yields the bloom and odour of leaf and flower, soft zephyrs and refreshing waters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “Ye may not slay him now. The hour's adverse, His star is in the zenith, and it burns Brighter and brighter now. Ye arm in vain.” Let us now return to our young traveller, whose escape we have already narrated. Utterly unconscious of the melancholy circumstance which had diverted his enemies from the pursuit of himself, he had followed studiously the parting directions of the young maiden, to whose noble feeling and fearless courage he was indebted for his present safety; and taken the almost blind path which she had hastily described to him. On this route he had for some time proceeded, with a motion not extravagantly free, but sufficiently so, having the start, and with the several delays to which his pursuers had been subjected, to have escaped the danger—while the vigour of his steed lasted—even had they fallen on the proper route. He had proceeded in this way for several miles, when at length he came upon a place whence several roads diverged into opposite sections of the country. Ignorant of the localities, he reined in his horse, and deliberated with himself for a few moments as to the path he should pursue. While thus engaged, a broad bright glare of flame suddenly illumined the woods on his left hand, followed with the shrieks, equally sudden, seemingly of a woman. There was no hesitation in the action of the youth. With unscrupulous and fearless precipitation, he gave his horse the necessary direction, and with a smart application of the rowel, plunged down the narrow path towards the spot from whence the alarm had arisen. As he approached, the light grew more intense, and he at length discovered a little cottage-like dwelling, completely embowered in thick foliage, through the crevices of which the flame proceeded, revealing the cause of terror, and illuminating for some distance the dense woods around. The shrieks still continued; and throwing himself from his horse, Ralph darted forward, and with a single and sudden application of his foot, struck the door from its hinges, and entered the dwelling just in time to save its inmates from the worst of all manner of death. The apartment was in a light blaze—the drapery of a couch which stood in one corner partially consumed, and, at the first glance, the whole prospect indicating but little hope of a successful struggle with the conflagration. There was no time to be lost, yet the scene was enough to have paralyzed the nerves of the most heroic action. On the couch thus circumstanced lay an ancient lady, seemingly in the very last stages of disease, and progressing rapidly to dissolution. She seemed only at intervals conscious of the fire. At her side, in a situation almost as helpless as her own, was the young female whose screams had first awakened the attention of the traveller. She lay moaning beside the couch, shrieking at intervals, and though in momentary danger from the flames, which continued to increase, taking no steps for their arrest or avoidance. Ralph went manfully to work, and had the satisfaction of finding partial success attend his efforts. With a fearless hand he grasped and tore down the inflammable and burning drapery which curtained the windows and the couch; and which, made of light cotton stuffs, presented a ready auxiliar to the progress of the destructive element. Striking down the burning shutter with a single and strong blow, he admitted the fresh air, without which suffocation must soon have followed, and throwing from the apartment such of the furniture as had been seized upon by the flames, he found little difficulty in arresting their farther advance. All this was the work of a few moments. There had been no word of intercourse between the parties, and the youth now surveyed them with looks of curious inquiry, for the first time. The invalid, as we have said, was evidently struggling with the last stages of natural decay. Her companion was evidently youthful, in spite of those marks which even the unstudied eye might have discerned in her features, of a temper and a spirit subdued and put to rest by the world's strife and trial, and by afflictions which are not often found to crowd and to make up the history and being of the young. Their position was peculiarly insulated, and Ralph wondered much at the singularity of a scene to which his own experience could furnish no parallel. Here were two lone women—living on the borders of a savage nation, and forming the frontier of a class of whites little less savage, without any protection, and, to his mind, without any motive for making such their abiding place. His wonder might possibly have taken the shape of inquiry, but that there was something of oppressive reserve and shrinking timidity in the air of the young woman, who alone could have replied to his inquiries. At this time an old female negro entered, now for the first time alarmed by the outcry, who assisted in removing such traces of the fire as still lingered about the room. She seemed to occupy a neighbouring outhouse, to which, having done what seemed absolutely necessary, she immediately retired. Colleton, with a sentiment of the deepest commiseration, proceeded to reinstate things as they might have been before the conflagration, and having done so, and having soothed, as far as he well might, the excited apprehensions of the young girl, who made her acknowledgments in a not unbecoming style, he ventured to ask a few questions as to the condition of the old lady and of herself; but finding from the answers that the subject was not an agreeable one, and having no pretence further to delay, he prepared to depart. He inquired, however, his farther route to the Chestatee river, and thus obtained a solution of the difficulty which beset him in the choice of roads at the fork. While thus employed, however, and just at the conclusion of his labours, there came another personage upon the scene, to whom it is necessary that we should direct some of our attention. It will be remembered that Rivers and Munro, after the murder of Forrester, had separated—the latter on his return to the village—the other in a direction which seemed to occasion some little dissatisfaction in the mind of his companion. After thus separating, Rivers, to whom the whole country was familiar, taking a shorter route across the forest, by which the sinuosities of the main road were generally avoided, entered, after the progress of a few miles, into the very path taken by Ralph Colleton, and which, had it been chosen by his pursuers in the first instance, must have entirely changed the features G 2 of the whole transaction. In taking this course it was not the thought of the outlaw to overtake the individual whose blood he so much desired; but with an object which will have its development as we continue, he came to the cottage at the very time when, having succeeded in overcoming the flames, Ralph was employed in a task almost as difficult—that of assuring the affrighted inmates of the absence of any farther danger. With a caution which old custom had made almost natural in such cases, Rivers, as he approached the cross-roads, concealed his horse in the cover of the woods, advanced noiselessly, and with not a little surprise to the cottage, whose externals had undergone no little alteration from the loss of the shutter; the blackened marks, visible enough in the moonlight, around the window-frame, and the general look of confusion which hung about it. A second glance made out the steed of our traveller, which he approached and examined. The survey awakened all those emotions which operated upon his spirit when referring to his successful rival; and approaching the cottage with extreme caution, he took post for awhile at one of the windows, the shutter of which, partially unclosed, enabled him to take in at a glance each particular of the entire apartment. He saw, at once, the occasion which had induced the presence, in this situation, of his most hateful enemy; and the thoughts were strangely discordant which thronged and possessed his bosom. At one moment he had drawn his pistol to his eye—his finger rested upon the trigger, and the doubt which interposed between the youth and eternity, though it sufficed for his safety then, was of the most slight and shadowy description. Again came a thought savagely sanguinary to his soul, and the weapon's muzzle fell point blank upon the devoted bosom of Ralph, when the slight figure of the young woman passing between, again arrested the design of the outlaw, who, with muttered curses, uncocking, returned the weapon to his belt. Whatever might have been the relationship between him and these females, there was an evident reluctance on the part of Rivers to exhibit his ferocious hatred of the youth before those to whom he had just rendered a great and unquestioned service; and though untroubled by any feeling of gratitude for them and for their escape, he was yet unwilling, believing, as he did, that his victim was now perfectly secure, that they should undergo any further shock, at a moment too of such severe suffering and trial as must follow with the one, from those fatal pangs which were destroying the other. Ralph now prepared to depart; and taking leave of the young woman, who alone seemed conscious of his services, and warmly acknowledged them, he proceeded to the door. Rivers, who had watched his motions attentively, and heard the directions given him by the girl for his progress, at the same moment proceeded from the window, and placed himself under the shelter of a huge tree, at a little distance on the path which his enemy was directed to pursue. Here he waited like the tiger, ready to take the fatal leap, and plunge his fangs into the bosom of his victim. Nor did he wait long. Ralph was soon upon his steed, and on the road; but the Providence that watches over and protects the innocent was with him, and it happened, most fortunately, that just before he reached the point at which his enemy stood in watch, the badness of the road had occasioned those who travelled it to diverge for a few paces into a little sinuosity, which, at a little distance on, and after the difficulty had been rounded, brought them into it again. Upon this “turn-out” (as it is technically called), Ralph entered, and the tread of his horse warned the outlaw of the change in his enemy's position. This change did not at the moment trouble him much, though, such was his temper, every thing which had the effect of thwarting or restraining, though for an instant, his desires, irritated him to madness. He set about to retrieve the lost ground by passing at once across the little copse which interposed between the two paths. He had just gained a position in it commanding the path, when the traveller approached, moving on unconscious of all danger, and happy with the pleasing excitement natural to one who, solicitous of human happiness, has just performed a good action. The pace of the youth was slow and inattentive. The outlaw coolly prepared his pistol as he approached—the huge tree, under the shelter of which he lurked, effectually concealed him, and his respiration grew restrained at every step in Ralph's advance. At length the form of man and horse grew fairly perceptible—it was almost beside him—the deadly aim was taken —the hand on the trigger, when suddenly, as the horseman passed beneath the fatal tree, a huge pair of wings, with a wild and flapping noise, rushed from among its branches. The steed took flight, and went headlong forward; while the outlaw, seized upon for the first time in his life with a nameless terror, in which his excited imagination took an active part, dropped the fatal weapon, and for a moment stood paralyzed. In a moment he was reassured, when the cause of his affright was explained in the uncouth hootings of the owl, whom the tread of the horse's hoofs had expelled from the quiet perch of his tree, and compelled to take shelter in another. Cursing the youth's good fortune, not less than his own weakness, the fierce passions of Rivers were such that he gnashed his teeth in something like delirium. Colleton, meanwhile, unconscious of the danger which had awaited him, was now fairly beyond all present pursuit, and so frequently and completely had his enemy been baffled in the brief progress of a single night, that he was almost led to believe—for, like most criminals, he too was not without his superstition— that his foe was under some special guardianship. With ill-concealed anger, and a stern impatience, he turned away from the spot in which he had been just foiled, and entered the dwelling, where we propose also to return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “She had a song of willow— willow—willow. Shakspeare. His entrance awakened no emotion among the inmates of the dwelling; indeed, at the moment, it was almost unperceived. The young woman happened to be in close attendance upon her parent, for such the person was, and did not observe his approach, while he stood at some little distance from the couch surveying the scene. The old lady was endeavouring, though with a feebleness that grew more apparent with every breath, to articulate something, to which she appeared to attach much importance, in the ears of the kneeling girl, who with breathless attention seemed desirous of making it out, but in vain; and signifying by her countenance the disappointment which she felt, the speaker, with something like anger, shook her skinny finger feebly in her face, and the broken and incoherent words, with rapid effort but like success, endeavoured to find their way through the half closed aperture between her teeth. The tears fell fast and full from the eyes of the kneeling girl, who neither sobbed nor spoke, but, with continued and yet despairing attention, endeavoured earnestly to catch the few words of one who was on the eve of departure, and the words of whom, at such a moment, almost invariably acquire a value never attached to them before; as the sound of a harp, when the chords are breaking, are said to articulate a sweet sorrow, as if in mourning for their own fate. The outlaw, all this while, stood apart and in silence. Although perhaps but little impressed with the native solemnity of the scene before him, he was not so ignorant of what was due to humanity, and not so unfeeling in reference to the parties here interested, as to seek to disturb its progress or propriety with tone, look, or gesture, which might make either of them regret his presence. Becoming impatient, however, of a colloquy, which, as he saw that it had not its use, and was only productive of mortification to one of the parties, he thought only prudent to terminate; he advanced towards them, and his tread, for the first time, warned the parties of his presence. With an effort which seemed supernatural, the dying woman raised herself with a sudden start in the bed, and her eyes glared upon him with a threatening horror, and her lips parting, disclosed the broken and decayed teeth beneath, ineffectually gnashing, while her long skinny fingers warned him away. All this time she appeared to speak, but the words were unarticulated, though from the expression of every feature, it was evident that indignation and reproach made up the entire amount of every thing she had to express. The outlaw was not easily influenced by anger so impotent as this; and from his manner of receiving it, it appeared that he had been for some time accustomed to a reception of a like kind from the same origin. He approached the young girl, who had now risen from her knees, and spoke to her in words of comparative kindness. “Well, Ellen, you have had an alarm, but I am glad to see you have suffered no injury. How happened the fire, which I see has been nigh burning you all up?” The young woman explained the cause of conflagration, and narrated in brief the assistance which had been received from the stranger. “But I was so terrified, Guy,” she added “that I had not presence of mind enough to thank him.” “And what should be the value of your spoken thanks, Ellen. The stranger, if he have sense, must feel that he has them, and the utterance of such things had better be let alone. But, how is the old lady now? I see she loves me no better than formerly.” “She is sinking fast, Guy, and is now incapable of speech. Before you came, she seemed desirous of saying something to me, but she tried in vain to speak, and now I scarcely think her conscious.” “Believe it not, Ellen—she is conscious of all that is going on, though her voice may fail her. Her eye is even now fixed upon me, and with the old expression. She would tear me if she could.” “Oh, think not thus of the dying, Guy; of her who has never harmed, and would never harm you, if she had the power. And yet, heaven knows, and we both know she has had reason enough to hate, and if she could, to destroy you. But she has no such feeling now.” “You mistake, Ellen, or would keep the truth from me. You know she has always hated me— and, indeed, as you say, she has had cause enough to hate and destroy me. Had another done to me as I have done to her, I should not sleep till my hand was in his heart.” “She forgives you all, Guy, I know she does, and God knows I forgive you; I, who, above all others, have most reason to curse you for ever. Think not that she can hate, upon the brink of the grave. Her mind wanders, and no wonder that the wrongs of earth press upon her memory, her reason being gone. She knows not herself of the mood which her features express. Look not upon her, Guy, I pray you, or let me turn away my eyes.” “Your spirit, Ellen, is more gentle and shrinking than hers. Had you felt like her, I verily believe that many a night when I have been at rest within your arms, you would have driven a knife into my heart.” “Horrible, Guy! how can you imagine such a thing. Base and worthless as you have made me, I am too much in your power; I fear—I love you too much; though like a poison or a firebrand you have clung to my bosom, I could not have felt for you a single thought of resentment. You say well when you call me shrinking. I am a creature of a thousand fears—I am all weakness and worthlessness.” “Well, well—let us not talk further of this. When was the doctor here last?” “In the evening he came, and left some directions, but told us plainly what we had to expect. He said she could not survive longer than the night; and she looks like it, for within the last few hours she has sunk surprisingly. But have you brought the medicine?” “I have, and some drops which are said to stimulate and strengthen.” “I fear me they are now of little use, and may only serve to keep up life in misery. But they may enable her to speak, and I should like to hear what she seems so desirous to impart.” Ellen took the cordial, and hastily preparing a portion in a wineglass according to the directions, proceeded to administer it to the gasping patient; but while the glass was at her lips, the last paroxysm of death came on, and with it something more of that consciousness now fleeting for ever. Dashing aside the nostrum with one hand, with the other she drew the shrinking and half-fainting girl to her side, and pressing her down beside her, appeared to give utterance to that, which, from the action, and the few and audible words she made out to articulate, would seem to have been a benediction. Rivers, seeing the motion, and remarking the almost supernatural strength with which the last spasms had endued her, would have taken the girl from her embrace; but his design was anticipated by the dying woman, whose eyes glared upon him with an expression rather demoniac than human, while her paralytic hand, shaking with ineffectual effort, waved him off. A broken word escaped her lips here and there, and—“sin”—“forgiveness”—was all that reached the ears of her grandchild, when her head sank back upon the pillow, and she expired without a groan. A dead silence followed this event. The girl had no uttered anguish—she spoke not her sorrows aloud; yet there was that in the wo-begone countenance, and the dumb grief, that left no doubt of the deep, though suppressed and half-subdued agony of soul within. She seemed one to whom the worst of life had been long since familiar, and Vol. II.—H where one we might readily suppose who would not find it difficult herself to die. She had certainly outlived pride and hope, if not love; and if the latter feeling had its place in her bosom, as without doubt it had, then was it a hopeless lingerer, long after the sunshine and zephyr had gone which first awakened it into bloom and flower. She knelt beside the inanimate form of her old parent, shedding no tear, and uttering no sigh. Tears would have poorly expressed the wo which at that moment she felt; and the outlaw, growing impatient of the dumb spectacle, now ventured to approach and interrupt her. She rose, meekly, and without reluctance as he spoke; with a manner which said as plainly as words could have said—`command, and I obey. Bid me go, even now, at midnight, on a perilous journey, over and into foreign lands, and I go without murmur and repining.' She was a heart-stricken—a heart-broken and abused woman—and yet she loved still, and loved her destroyer. “Ellen—” said he, taking her hand—“your mother was a Christian—a strict worshipper—one who, for the last few years of her life, seldom put the Bible out of her hands—and yet, she cursed me in her very soul as she went out of the world.” “Guy, Guy, speak not so, I pray you. Spare me this cruelty, and say not for the departed spirit what it surely never would have said of itself.” “But it did so say, Ellen, and of this I am satisfied. Hark ye, girl. I know something of mankind, and womankind too, and I am not often mistaken in the expression of human faces, and certainly was not mistaken in hers. When, in the last paroxysm, you knelt beside her with your head down upon her hand and in her grasp, and as I approached her, her eyes, which feebly threw up the film then rapidly closing over them, shot out a most angry glare of hatred and reproof, while her lips parted—I could see, though she could articulate no word—with involutions which indicated the curse that she could not speak.” “Think not so, I pray you. She had much cause to curse, and often would she have done so, but for my sake she did not. She would call me a poor fool, that so loved the one who had brought misery and shame to all of us; but her malediction was arrested, and she said it not. Oh, no! she forgave you, I know she did—heard you not the words which she uttered at the last?” “Yes, yes—but no matter. We must now talk of other things, Ellen, and first of all, you must know, then, I am about to be married.” Had a bolt from the crossbow at that moment penetrated into her heart, the person he addressed could not have been more transfixed at this speech. She started—an inquiring and tearful doubt rose into her eyes, as they settled piercingly upon his own; but the information they met with there needed no further word of assurance from his lips. He was a stern tyrant,—one, however, who did not trifle. “I feared as much, Guy—I have had thoughts which as good as told me this long before. The silent form before me has said to me over and over again, he will never wed her whom he has dishonoured. Oh, fool that I was—spite of her forebodings and my own, I thought—I still think, and oh, Guy, let me not think in vain—that there would be a time when you would take away the reproach from my name and the sin from my soul, by making me your wife, as you have so often promised.” “You have indeed thought like a child, Ellen, if you supposed that, situated as I am, I could ever marry simply because I loved.” “And will you not love her whom you are now about to wed?” “Not as much as I have loved you—not half so much as I love you now—if it be that I have such a feeling at this moment in my bosom.” “And wherefore then would you wed, Guy, with one whom you do not, whom you cannot love? In what have I offended—have I ever reproached or looked unkindly on you, Guy, even when you came to me, stern and full of reproaches, chafed with all things and with everybody?” “There are motives, Ellen, governing my actions into which you must not inquire—” “What, not inquire, when on these actions depend all my hope—all my life! Now indeed you are the tyrant which my old mother said, and all people say, you are.” The girl for a moment forgot her submissiveness, and her words were tremulous, less with sorrow than the somewhat strange spirit which her wrongs had impressed upon her. But she soon felt the sinking of the momentary inspiration, and quickly sought to remove the angry scowl which she perceived coming over the brow of her companion. “Nay, nay—forgive me, Guy—let me not reproach—let me not accuse you. I have not done so before; I would not do so now. Do with me as you please; and yet, if you are bent to wed with another, and forget and overlook your wrongs to me, there is one kindness which would become your hands, and which I would joy to receive from them. Will you do for me this kindness, Guy?— nay, now be not harsh, but say that you will do it.” She seized his hand appealingly as she spoke, and her moist but untearful eyes were fixed pleadingly upon his own. The outlaw hesitated for a moment before he replied. “I propose, Ellen, to do for you all that may be necessary—to provide you with additional comforts, and carry you to a place of additional security, where you shall live to yourself, and have good attendance.” “This is kind—this is much, Guy; but not much more than you have been accustomed to do for me. That which I seek from you now is something more than this—promise me that it shall be as I say.” “If it breaks not into my arrangements—if it makes me not go aside from my path, I will certainly do it, Ellen. Speak therefore; what is it I can do for you.” “It will interfere with none of your arrangements, Guy, I am sure; it cannot take you from your path, for you could not have provided for that of which you knew not. I have your pledge, therefore—have I not.” “You have,” was the reply, while the manner of Rivers was tinctured with something like curiosity. “That is kind—that is as you ought to be. Hear me now, then,” and her voice sunk into a whisper, as if she feared the utterance of her own words— “take your knife, Guy—pause not, do it quickly, lest I fear and tremble—strike it deep into the bosom of the poor Ellen, and lay her beside the cold parent, whose counsels she despised, and all of whose predictions are now come true. Strike— strike quickly, Guy Rivers—I have your promise— you cannot recede—if you have honour, if you have truth, you must do as I ask. Give me death— give me peace.” “Foolish girl, would you trifle with me—would you have me spurn and hate you? Beware!” The outlaw well knew the yielding and sensitive H 2 material out of which his victim had been made. His stern rebuke was well calculated to effect in her bosom that revulsion of feeling which he knew would follow any threat of a withdrawal, even of the lingering and frail fibres of that affection, few and feeble as they were, which he might have once persuaded her to believe had bound him to her. The consequence was immediate, and her subdued tone and resigned action evinced the now entire supremacy of her natural temperament. “Oh, forgive me, Guy, I know not what I ask or what I do. I am so worn and weary, and my head is so heavy, that I think it were far better if I were in my grave, with the cold frame whom we shall soon put there. Heed not what I say—I am sad and sick, and have not the spirit of reason, or a healthy will to direct me. Do with me as you will—I will obey you—go anywhere, and, worst of all, behold you wed another—ay, stand by, if you desire it, and look on the ceremony, and try to forget that you once promised me that I should be a party to it, along with you.” “You speak more wisely, Ellen—and you will think more calmly upon it when the present grief of your mother's death passes off.” “Oh, that is no grief, now, Guy,” was the rather hasty reply. “That is no grief now;—should I regret that she has escaped these tidings—should I regret that she has ceased to feel trouble, and to see and shed tears—should I mourn, Guy, that she who loved me to the last, in spite of my follies and vices, has ceased now to mourn over them? Oh, no! this is no grief, now; it was grief but a little while ago, but now you have made it matter of rejoicing.” “Think not of it,—speak no more in this strain, Ellen, lest you anger me.” “I will not—chide me not—I have no farther reproaches. Yet, Guy, is she, the lady you are about to wed—is she beautiful,—is she young—has she long raven tresses, as I had once, when your fingers used to play in them?” and with a sickly smile, which had in it something of an old vanity, she unbound the string which confined her own hair, and let it roll down upon her back in thick and beautiful volumes, black, glossy, and delicately soft as silk. The outlaw was moved. For a moment his iron muscles relaxed—a gentler expression overspread his countenance, and he took her in his arms. That single, half-reluctant embrace was a boon not much bestowed in the latter days of his victim, and it awakened a thousand tender recollections in her heart, and unsealed a warm spring of gushing waters. An infantine smile was in her eyes, while the tears were flowing down her cheeks. But, shrinking or yielding—at least to any great extent—made up very little of the character of the dark man on whom she depended, and the more than feminine weakness of the young girl who hung upon his bosom like a dying flower, received its rebuke, after a few moments of unwonted tenderness, when coldly resuming his stern habit, he put her from his arms, and announced to her his intention of immediately taking his departure. “What,” she asked—“will you not stay with me through the night, and situated as I am?” “It is impossible—even now I am waited for, and should have been some hours on my way to an appointment which I must not break. It is not with me as with you—I have obligations to others who depend on me, and who might suffer injury were I to deceive them.” “But this night, Guy—there is little of it left, and I am sure you will not be expected before the daylight. I feel a new terror when I think I shall be left by all, and here, too, alone with the dead.” “You will not be alone, and if you were, Ellen, you have been thus lonely for many months past, and should be now accustomed to it.” “Why, so I should, for it has been a fearful and a weary time, and I went not to my bed one night without dreading that I should never behold another day.” “Why, what had you to alarm you—you suffered no affright—no injury? I had taken care that throughout the forest your cottage should be respected.” “So I had your assurance, and when I thought, I believed it. I knew you had the power to do as you assured me you would, but still there were moments when our own desolation came across my mind; and what with my sorrows and my fears, I was sometimes persuaded, in my madness, to pray that I might be relieved of them, were it even by the hands of death.” “You were ever thus foolish, Ellen, and you have as little reason now to apprehend as then. Besides, it is only for the one night, and in the morning I shall send those to you who will attend to your own removal to another spot, and to the interment of the body.” “And where am I to go?” “What matters it where, Ellen? You have my assurance that it shall be a place of security, and good attendance to which I shall send you.” “True—what matters it where I go—whether among the savage or the civilized. They are to me all alike, since I may not look them in the face, or take them by the hand, or hold communion with them either at the house of God or at the family fireside.” The gloomy despondence of her spirit was uppermost; and she went on, in a series of bitter musings, denouncing herself as an outcast—a worthless something, and, in the language of the sacred text, calling on the rocks and mountains cover her. The outlaw, who had none of those fine feelings which permitted of even momentary sympathy with that desolation of heart, the sublime agonies of which are so well calculated to enlist and awaken it, cut short the string of sorrow and complaint by a fierce exclamation, which seemed to stun every sense of her spirit. “Will you never have done?” he demanded. “Am I for ever to listen to this weakness—this unavailing reproach of yourself and every thing around you? Do I not know that all your complaints and reproaches, though you address them in so many words to yourself, are intended only for my use and ear? Can I not see through the poor hypocrisy of such a lamentation? Know I not that when you curse and deplore the sin, you only withhold the malediction from him who tempted and partook of it, in the hope that his own spirit will apply it all to himself? Away, girl —I thought you had a nobler spirit—I thought you felt the love that I now find existed only in expression.” “I do feel that love—I would, Guy, that I felt it not—that it did exist only in my words. I were far happier then than I am now, since stern look and language from you would then utterly fail to vex and wound my spirit as it does now. I cannot bear your reproaches—look not thus upon me and speak not in those harsh sentences—not now—not now, at least, and in this melancholy presence.” Her looks turned upon the dead body of her parent as she spoke, and with convulsive effort she rushed towards and clasped it round. She threw herself beside the corpse and remained inanimate, while the outlaw, leaving the house for an instant, called the negro servant and commanded her attendance. He now approached the girl, and taking up her hand, which lay supine upon the bosom of the dead body, would have soothed her grief, but though she did not repulse, she yet did not regard him. “Be calm, Ellen,” he said, “recover and be firm. In the morning you shall have early and good attention, and with this object, in part, am I disposed to hurry now. Think not, girl, that I forget you. Whatever may be my fortune, I shall always have an eye to yours. I leave you now, but shall see you before long, when I shall settle you permanently and comfortably. Farewell.” He left her in seeming unconsciousness of the words whispered in her ears, yet she heard them all, and duly estimated their value. To her, to whom he had once pledged himself entirely, the cold boon of his attention and sometime care was painfully mortifying. She exhibited nothing, however, beyond what we have already seen, of the effect of this cold consolation upon her heart. There is a period in human emotions, when feeling itself becomes imperceptible—when the heart (as it were) receives the coup de grace, and days, and months, and years, before the body expires, grows unconscious of the fire which is consuming it. We would not have it understood to be altogether the case with the young destitute before us; but, at least, if she still continued to feel these still occurring influences, there was little or no outward indication of their power upon the hidden spirit. She said nothing to him on his departure, but with a half-wandering sense, that may perhaps have described something of the ruling passion of an earlier day, she rose, shortly after he had left the house, and placing herself before the small mirror which surmounted the toilet in the apartment, re-arranged with studious care, and with an eye to its most attractive appearance, the long and flowing tresses of that hair, which, as we have already remarked, was of the most silky and ravenlike description. Every ringlet was adjusted to its place, as if nothing of sorrow was about her—none of the badges and evidences of death and decay in her thought. She next proceeded to the re-adjustment of the dress she wore, taking care that a string of pearl, probably the gift of her now indifferent lover, should leave its place in the little cabinet, where, with other trinkets of the kind, it had been locked up carefully for a long season, and once more adorned with it the neck which it failed utterly to surpass in delicacy or in whiteness. Having done this, she again took her place on the couch, along with the corpse; and with a manner which did not appear to indicate a doubt of the still lingering spirit, she raised the lifeless head, with the gentlest effort placing her arm beneath, then laid her own quietly on the pillow beside it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “The rogues came down the hill, In a formidable band— And the sable captain call'd aloud, But he could'nt make us stand.” The First Fight. Ignorant, as we have already said, of his late most providential escape from the weapon of his implacable enemy, Ralph Colleton was borne forward by his affrighted steed with a degree of rapidity which entirely prevented his rider from remarking any of the objects around him, or, indeed, as the moon began to wane amid a clustering body of clouds, of determining positively whether he was still in the road or not. The trace (as public roads are called in that region) had been rudely cut out by some of the earlier travellers through the Indian country, merely traced out— and hence, perhaps, the term—by a blaze, or white spot, made upon the trees by hewing from them the bark; which badge, repeated in succession upon those growing immediately upon the line chosen for the destined road, indicated its route to the wayfarer. It had never been much travelled, and from the free use at the present time of other and more direct courses, it was left almost totally unemployed, save by those living immediately in its neighbourhood. It had therefore become, at the time of which we speak, what, in backwood phrase, is known as a blind-path. Such being the case, it is not difficult to imagine that, when able to restrain his horse, Ralph, as he feared, found himself entirely out of its guidance—wandering without direction among the old trees of the forest. Still, as for the night now nearly over, he could have no distinct point in view, and saw just as little reason to go back as forward, he gave himself but little time for scruple or hesitation. Resolutely, though with a cautious and gentle motion, he pricked his steed forward through the woods, accommodating his philosophy, as well as he could, to the various interruptions which the future, as if to rival the past, seemed to have treasured up in store for him. He had not proceeded far in this manner when he caught the dim rays of a distant fire, flickering and ascending among the trees to the left of the direction he was taking. The blaze had something in it excessively cheering, and, changing his course, he went forward under its guidance. In this effort, he stumbled upon something like a path, which, pursuing, brought him at length to a small and turbid creek, into which he plunged fearlessly, and soon found himself in swimming water. The ford had been little used, and the banks were steep, so that he got out with difficulty upon the opposite side. Having done so, his eye was enabled to take a full view of the friendly fire which had just attracted his regard, and which he soon made out to proceed from the encampment of a wagoner, such as may be seen every day, or every night, in the wild woods of the southern country. He was emigrating, with all his goods and gods, to that wonderfully winning region, in the estimation of this people, the valley of the Mississippi. The emigrant was a stout, burly, bluff old fellow, with full round cheeks, a quick, twinkling eye, and limbs rather Herculean than human. He might have been fifty-five years or so; and his two sons, one of Vol. II.—I them a man grown, the other a tall and goodly youth of eighteen, promised well to be just such vigorous and healthy looking personages as their father. The old woman, by whom we mean—in the manner of speech common to the same class and region —to indicate the spouse of the wayfarer, and mother of the two youths, was busied about the fire, boiling a pot of coffee, and preparing the family repast for the night. A somewhat late hour for supper and such employment, thought our wanderer; but the difficulty soon explained itself in the condition of their wagon, and the conversation which ensued among the travellers. There was yet another personage in the assembly, who must be left to introduce himself to the reader. The force of the traveller—for such is the term by which the number of his slaves are understood— was small; consisting of some six workers, and three or four little negro children asleep under the wagon. The workers were occupied at a little distance, in replacing boxes, beds, and some household trumpery, which had been taken out of the wagon, to enable them to effect its release from the slough in which it had cast one of its wheels, and broken its axle, and the restoration of which had made their supper so late in the night. The heavier difficulties of their labour had been got over, and with limbs warmed and chafed by the extra exercise they had undergone, the whites had thrown themselves under a tree, at a little distance from the fire at which the supper was in preparation, while a few pine torches, thrown together, gave them sufficient light to read and remark the several countenances of their group. “Well, by dogs, we've had a tough 'bout of it, boys; and, hark'ye, strannger, give us your hand. I don't know what we should have done without you, for I never seed man handle a little pole-axe as you did that same affair of your'n. You must have spent, I reckon, a pretty smart time at the use of it, now, didn't ye?” To this speech of the old farmer, a ready reply was given by the stranger, in the identical voice and language of our old acquaintance, the pedler, Jared Bunce, of whom, and of whose stock in trade, the reader will probably have some recollection. “Well, now, I guess, friend, you an't far wide of your reckoning. I've been a matter of some fifteen or twenty years knocking about, off and on, in one way or another, with this same instrument, and pretty's the service now, I tell ye, that it's done me in that bit of time.” “No doubt, no doubt—but what's your trade, if I may be so bold, that made you larn the use of it so nicely.” “Oh, what—my trade—why, to say the truth, now, I never was brought up to any trade in particular, but I play a pretty slick hand, now, I tell you, at all of them. I've been in my time a little of a farmer, a little of a merchant, a little of a sailor, and somehow or other, a little of every thing, and all sort of things. My father was jest like myself, and swore, before I was born, that I should be born jest like him—and so I was. Never were two black peas more alike. He was a 'cute old fellow, and swore he'd make me so too—and so he did. You know how he did that?—now, I'll go a York shilling 'gainst a Louisiana bit, that you can't tell to save you.” “Why no, I can't—let's hear,” was the response of the wagoner, somewhat astounded by the volubility of his new acquaintance. “Well, then, I'll tell you. He sent me away, to make my fortune and git my edication 'mongst them who wasn't cute themselves, and maybe that an't the best school for larning, a simple boy ever went to. It was the very making of me, so far as I was made.” “Well, now, that is a smart way, I should reckon, to get one's edication. And in this way I suppose you larned how to chop with your little pole-axe—dogs!—but you've made me as smart a looking axle as I ever tacked to my team.” “I tell you, friend, there's nothing like sich an edication. It does every thing for a man, and he larns to make every thing out of any thing. I could make my bread where these same Indians wouldn't find the skin of a hoe-cake; and in these woods or in the middle of the sea, t'ant any thing for me to say I can contrive always to fish up some notion that will sell in the market.” “Well, now, that's wonderful, strannger, and I should like to see how you would do it.” “You can't do nothing, no how, friend, unless you begin at the beginning. You'll have to begin when you're jest a mere boy, and set about getting your edication as I got mine. There's no two ways about it. It won't come to you; you must go to it. When you're put out into the wide world, and have no company and no acquaintance, why, what are you to do? Suppose now, when your wagon mired down, I had not come to your help, and cut out your wood, and put in the spoke, wouldn't you have had to do it yourself?” “Yes—to be sure; but then I couldn't have done it in a day. I an't handy at these things.” “Well, that was jest the way with me when I was a boy. I had nobody to help me out of the mud—nobody to splice my spokes or assist me any how, and so I larned to do it myself. And now, would you think it, I'm sometimes glad of a little turn over, or an accident, jest that I may keep my hand in, and not forget to be able to help myself or my neighbours.” “Well, you're a curous person, and I'd like to hear something more about you. But it's high time we should wet our whistles, and it's but dry talking without something to wash a clear way for the slack. So, boys, be up, and fish up the jemmijohn—I hope it han't been thumped to bits in the rut. If it has I shall be in a tearing passion.” “Well, now, that won't be reasonable, seeing that it's no use, and jest wasting good breath that might bring a fair price in the market.” “What, not get in a passion if all the whiskey's gone? That won't do, strannger, and though you have helped me out of the ditch, by dogs, no man shall prevent me from getting in a passion if I choose it.” “Oh, to be sure, friend—you an't up to my idee. I did'nt know that it was for the good it did you that you got in a passion. I am clear that when a man feels himself better from a passion, he oughtn't to be shy in getting into it. Though that wasn't a part of my edication, yet I guess, if such a thing would make me feel more comfortable, I'd get in a passion fifty times a day.” “Well, now, strannger, you talk like a man of sense. 'Drot the man, says I, who hasn't the courage to get in a passion. None but a miserable, shadow-skinning Yankee would refuse to get in a passion when his jug of whiskey was left in the road.” “Ahem—” coughed the dealer in small wares— the speech of the old wagoner grating harshly upon his senses; for if the Yankee be proud of any thing, it is of his country—its enterprise, its institutions; I 2 and of these, perhaps, he has more true and unqualified reason to be pleased and proud than any other one people on the face of the globe. He did not relish well the sitting quietly under the harsh censure of his companion, who seemed to regard the existence of a genuine emotion among the people down East as a manifest absurdity; and was thinking to come out with a defence, in detail, of the pretensions of New-England, when, prudence having first taken a survey of the huge limbs of the wagoner and calling to mind the fierce prejudices of the uneducated southrons generally against all his tribe, suggested the convenient propriety of an evasive reply. “Ahem—” repeated the Yankee, the argumentum ad hominem still prominent in his eyes— “well, now, I take it, friend, there's no love to spare for the people you speak of down in these parts. They don't seem to smell at all pleasant in this country.” “No, I guess not, strannger, as how should they —a mean, tricky, catchpenny, skulking set—that makes money out of everybody, and han't the spirit to spend it. I do hate them, now, worse than a pole-cat.” “Well, now, friend, that's strange. If you were to travel now for a spell, down about Boston or Salem in Massachusetts, or at Meriden in Connetticut, you'd hear tell of the Yankees quite different. If you believe what the people say thereabouts, you'd say there was no sich people on the face of the airth.” “That's jist because they don't know any thing about them; and it's not because they can't know them neither, for a Yankee is a varmint you can nose any where. It must be that none ever travels in those parts—selling their tin kettles, and their wooden clocks, and all their notions.” “Oh, yes, they do. They make 'em in those parts. I know it by this same reason, that I bought a lot myself from a house in Connetticut, a town called Meriden, where they make almost nothing else but clocks—where they make 'em by steam, and horse-power, and machinery, and will turn you out a hundred or two to a minute.” The pedler had somewhat “overleaped his shoulders,” as they phrase it in the west, when his companion drew himself back over the blazing embers, with a look of ill-concealed aversion, exclaiming, as he did so— “Why, you an't a Yankee, are you?” The pedler was a special pleader in one sense of the word, and knew the value of a technical distinction as well as his friend, Lawyer Pippin. His reply was prompt and professional. “Why, no, I an't a Yankee according to your idee. It's true, I was born among them, but that, you know, don't make a man one on them?” “No, to be sure not. Every man that's a freeman has a right to choose what country he shall belong to. My dad was born in Ireland, yet he always counted himself a full-blooded American.” The old man found a parallel in his father's nativity, which satisfied himself of the legitimacy of the ground taken by the pedler, and helped the latter out of his difficulty. “But here's the whiskey, standing by us all the time, waiting patiently to be drunk. Here, Nick Snell, boy, take your hands out of your breeches pocket, and run down with the calibash to the branch. The water is pretty good there, I reckon; and, strannger, after we've taken a sup, we'll eat a bite, and then lie down. It's high time, I reckon, that we do so.” It was in his progress to the branch, that Ralph Colleton came upon this member of the party. Nick Snell was no genius, and did not readily reply to the passing inquiry which was put to him by the youth, who advanced upon the main party while the dialogue between the pedler and the wagoner was in full gust. They started, as if by common consent, to their feet, as his horse's tread smote upon their ears; but satisfied with the appearance of a single man, and witnessing the jaded condition of his steed, they were content to invite him to partake with them of the rude cheer which the good woman was now busied in setting before them. The hoe-cakes and bacon were smoking finely, and the fatigue of the youth engaged his senses, with no unwillingness on their part, to detect a most savoury attraction in the assault which they made upon his sight and nostrils alike. He waited not for a second invitation, but in a few moments, having first stripped his horse, and put the saddle, by direction of the emigrant, into his wagon, he threw himself beside them upon the ground, and joined readily and heartily in the consumption of the goodly edibles which were spread out before them. They had not been long at this game when a couple of fine watch dogs which were in the camp, guarding the baggage, gave the alarm, and the whole party was on the alert, with sharp eye and cocked rifle. They commenced a survey, and at some distance could hear the tread of horsemen seemingly on the approach. The banditti, of which we have already spoken, were well known to the emigrant, and he had already to complain of divers injuries at their hands. It is not, therefore, matter of surprise, that he should place his sentinels, and prepare even for the most audacious attack. He had scarcely made this disposition of his force, which exhibited them to the best advantage, when the strangers made their appearance. They rode cautiously around, without approaching the defences sufficiently nigh to occasion strife, but evidently having for their object originally an attack upon the wayfarer. At length one of the party, which consisted of six persons, now came forward, and with a friendly tone of voice, bade them good evening, in a manner which seemed to indicate a desire to be upon a footing of the most amiable sort with them. The old man answered dryly, with some show of sarcastic indifference in his speech,— “Ay, good evening enough, if the moon had not gone down and if the stars were out, that we might pick out the honest men from the rogues.” “What, are there rogues in these parts, then, old gentleman?” asked the new comer. “Why do you ask me,” was the sturdy reply. “You ought to be able to say, without going farther than your own pockets.” “Why, you are tough to-night, my old buck,” was the somewhat crabbed speech of the visiter. “You'll find me troublesome, too, Mr. Night-walker—so take good counsel, and be off while you've whole bones, or I'll tumble you now in half a minute from your crittur, and give you a sharp supper of pine-knots.” “Well, that wouldn't be altogether kind on your part old fellow, and I mightn't be willing to let you; but as you seem not disposed to be civil, I suppose the best thing I can do is to be off.” “Ay, ay, be off. You get nothing out of us; and we've no shot that we want to throw away. Leave you alone, and Jack Ketch will save us shot.” “Ha, ha!” exclaimed the outlyer, in concert, and from the deeper emphasis which he gave it, in chorus to the laughter which followed, among the party, the dry expression of the old man's humour. “Ha, ha! old boy—you have the swing of it to-night,” was the reply of the visiter, as he rode off to his companions—“but, if you don't mind, we shall smoke you before you get into Alabam.” The robber rejoined his companions, and a sort of council for deliberation was determined upon among them. “How now, I ambert—you have been at dead fault,” was his sudden address, as he returned, to one of the party. “You assured me that old Snell and his two sons were the whole force that he carried, while I find two stout able-bodied men beside, all well armed, and ready for the attack. The old woman, too, standing with the gridiron in her fists, is equal of herself to any two men, hand to hand.” Lambert, a short, sly, dogged little personage, endeavoured to account for the error, if such it was —“but he was sure, that at starting, there were but three—they must have had company join them since. Did the lieutenant make out the appearance of the others?” “I did,” said the officer in command, “and, to say truth, they do not seem to be of the old fellow's party. They must have come upon him since the night. But how came you, Lambert, to neglect sawing the axle. You had time enough when it stood in the farm-yard last night, and you were about it a full hour. The wagon stands as stoutly on its all-fours as the first day it was built.” “I did that, sir, and did it, I thought, to the very mark. I calculated to leave enough solid to bear them to the night, when in our circuit we should come among them just in time to finish the business. The wood is stronger, perhaps, than I took it to be, but it won't hold out longer than to-morrow, I'm certain, when, if we watch, we can take our way with them.” “Well, I hope so, and we must watch them, for it won't do to let the old fellow escape. He has, I know, a matter of three or four hundred hard dollars in his possession, to buy lands in Mississippi, and it's a pity to let so much good money go out of the state.” “But why may we not set upon them now,” inquired one of the youngest of the party. “For a very good reason, Briggs—they are armed, ready, and nearly equal in number to ourselves; and though I doubt not we should be able to ride over them, yet I am not willing to leave one or more of us behind. Besides, if we keep the look-out to-morrow, as we shall, we can settle the business without any such risk.” This being the determination, the robbers, thus disappointed of their game, were nevertheless in better humour than might have been well expected; but such men are philosophers, and their very recklessness of human life is in some respects the result of a due estimate of its vicissitudes. They rode on their way laughing at the sturdy bluntness of the old wagoner, which their leader, of whom we have already heard under the name of Dillon, related to them at large. With a whoop and halloo, they cheered the travellers as they rode by, but at some distance from, the encampment. The tenants of the encampment, thus strangely but fortunately thrown together, having first seen that every thing was quiet, took their severally assigned places, and laid themselves down for repose. The pedler contenting himself with guessing that “them 'ere chaps did not make no great deal by that speculation.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “And here they dwell, the human-hating throng, Skill'd in all mischief, ripe for every wrong.” It was in the wildest and least trodden recesses of the rock and forest, that the band of outlaws, of which Rivers was the great head and leader, had fixed their place of abode and assemblage. A natural cavity, formed by the juxtaposition of two huge rocks, overhung by a third, with some few artificial additions, formed for them a cavern, in which—so admirably was it overgrown by the surrounding forest, and so finely situated among hills and abrupt ridges yielding few inducements for travel—they found the most perfect security. It is true such a shelter could not long have availed them as such, were the adjacent country in the possession of a civilized people; but the near neighbourhood of the Cherokees, by keeping back civilization, was perhaps, quite as much as the position they had chosen, its protection from the scrutiny of many, who had already, prompted by their excesses, endeavoured, but partially, on more than one occasion, to find them out. The place was distant from the village of Chestatee about ten miles, or perhaps more. No highway—no thoroughfare or public road passed in its neighbourhood, and it had been the policy of the outlaws to avoid the use of any vehicle, the traces of which might be followed. There was, beside, but little necessity for their employment. The place of counsel and deliberation was not necessarily their place of abode, and the several members of the band found it more profitable by far to reside, or keep stations, in the adjacent hamlets and stands (for by this latter name in those regions, the nightly stopping-places of wayfarers are commonly designated)—where, in most cases, they put on the appearance, and in many respects bore the reputation, of staid and sober working men. This arrangement was perhaps the very best for the predatory life they led, as it afforded opportunities for information which otherwise must have been lost to them. In this way they heard of this or that traveller—his destination—the objects he had in view, and the wealth he carried about with him. In one of these situations the knowledge of old Snell's journey, and the amount of wealth in his possession, had been acquired, and in the person of the worthy stable-boy who brought corn to the old fellow's horses the night before, and whom he rewarded with a thrip (the smallest silver coin known in the southern currency—the five cent issue excepted) we might, without spectacles, recognise the active fugleman of the outlaws, who sawed half through his axle, cleaned his wheels of all their grease, and then attempted to rob him the very night after. Nor, though thus situated, was it a matter of difficulty to call them together upon an emergency. One or more of the most trustworthy among them had only to make a tour over the road, and through the hamlets in which they were scattered within the circuit of ten or twenty miles, and as they kept Vol. II.—K usually with rigid punctuality to their several stations, they were soon apprized, and off at the first signal. A whisper in the ear of the hostler who brought out your horse, or the drover who put up the cattle, was enough; and the absence of a colt from pasture, or the missing of a stray young heifer from the flock, furnished a sufficient reason to the proprietor for the occasional absence of Tom, Dick, or Harry: who, in the meanwhile, was, most probably crying `stand' to a true man, or cutting a trunk from a sulky, or, in mere wantonness, shooting down the traveller who had perhaps given him a long chase, yet yielded nothing by way of compensation for the labour. Dillon, or, to speak more properly and to the card, Lieutenant Dillon, arrived at the place of assemblage just as the day was breaking. He was a leader of considerable influence among the outlaws, and, next to Rivers, was most popular. Indeed, in certain respects, he was far more popular; for, though perhaps not so adroit in his profession, nor so well fitted for its command, he was possessed of many of those qualities which are apt to be taking with “the fierce democratie!” He was a prince of hail fellows—was thoroughly versed in low jest and scurvy anecdote—could play at push-pins, and drink at every point in the game; and, strange to say, though always drinking, was never drunk. Nor, though thus accomplished, and thus prone to these accomplishments, did he ever neglect or forget those duties which he assumed to perform, or which were assigned him. No indulgence led him away from his post—and, on the reverse, no post compelled or constrained him into gravity. He was a careless, reckless blade, indifferent alike, it would seem, to sun or storm, rain or shine—and making of life a circle, that would not inaptly have illustrated the favourite text of Sardanapalus. He arrived at the cave, as we have said, just as the day was breaking. A shrill whistle along the ridges of wood and rock, as he passed them, denoted the various stations of the sentinels, as studiously strewn along the paths by which their place of refuge might be assailed, as if they were already beleaguered by a superior and assailing army. Without pausing to listen to the various speeches and inquiries which assailed his ears upon his arrival, he advanced to the cavern, and was told that the captain had been for some time anxiously awaiting his arrival—that he had morosely kept the inner recess of the cave, and since his return, which had not been until late in the night, had been seen but two or three times, and then but for a moment, when he had come forth to make inquiries for himself. Leaving his men differently disposed, Dillon at once penetrated into the small apartment in which his leader was lodged, assured of the propriety of the intrusion—which had otherwise subjected him, most probably, to some severe reprimand—from what had just been told him. The recess, which was separated from the outer hall by a curtain of thick coarse stuff, falling to the floor from a beam, the apertures for the reception of which had been chiselled in the rock, was dimly illuminated by a single lamp, hanging from a chain, which was in turn fastened to a pole that stretched directly across the apartment. A small table in the centre of the room, covered with a piece of cotton cloth, a few chairs, a broken mirror, and on a shelf that stood trimly in the corner, a few glasses and decanters, completed the furniture of the apartment. On the table at which the outlaw sat, lay his pistols—a huge and seemingly unwieldy, but well-made pair. A short sword, a dirk, and one or two other weapons of similar description, contemplated only for hand-to-hand purposes, lay along with them; and the better to complete the picture, now already something outré, a decanter of brandy and tumblers were contiguous. Rivers did not observe the slide of the curtain to the apartment, nor the entrance of Dillon. He was deeply absorbed in contemplation; his head rested heavily upon his two palms, while his eyes were deeply fixed upon the now opened miniature which he had torn from the neck of Lucy Munro, and which rested before him. He sighed not—he spoke not, but ever and anon, as if perfectly unconscious all the while of what he did, he drank from the tumbler of the compounded draught that stood before him, hurriedly and desperately, as if to keep the strong emotion from choking him. There was in his look a bitter agony of expression, indicating a vexed spirit, now more strongly than ever at work in a way which had, indeed, been one of the primest sources of his miserable life. It was a spirit ill at rest with itself—vexed at its own feebleness of execution—its incapacitude to attain and acquire the realization of its own wild and vague conceptions. His was the ambition of one who discovers at every step that nothing can be known, yet will not give up the unprofitable pursuit, because, even while making the discovery, he still hopes vainly that he may yet, in his own person, give the maxim the lie. For ever soaring to the sun, he was for ever realizing the fine Grecian fable of Icarus, and the sea of disappointment into which he perpetually fell, with its tumultuous tides and ever chafing billows, bearing him on from whirlpool to whirlpool, for ever battling and for ever lost. He was unconscious, as we have said, of the entrance and approach of his lieutenant, and words of bitterness, in soliloquy, fell at brief periods from his lips.— “It is after all the best—” he mused.—“Despair is the true parent of philosophy, since it begets indifference—yet do I not despair. Why should I hope? What prospect is there now, that these eyes, that lip, these many graces, and the imperial pride of that expression, which looks out like a high soul from the heaven that men talk and dream of—what delusion is there now to bid me hope they ever can be more to me than they are now. I care not for the world's ways—nor feel I now the pang of its scorn and its outlawry; yet I would it were not so, that I might, upon a field as fair as that of the most successful, assert my claim, and woo and win her—not with those childish notes of commonplace—that sickly cant of sentimental stuff which I despise, and which I know she despises no less than I. Yet, when this field was mine, as I now desire it, what more did it avail me. Where was the strong sense—the lofty reason that should then have conquered with an unobstructed force, sweeping all before it, as the flame that rushes through the long grass of the prairies. Gone—prostrate— dumb. The fierce passion was upward, and my heart was then more an outlaw than I myself am now. Yet there is one hope—one chance—one path, if not to her affections, at least to her. It shall be done, and then, most beautiful enchantress —witch, wizard, stern, and to me heartless, as thou hast ever been—thou shalt not always triumph.—I would that I could sleep on this—I would that I could sleep. There is but one time of happiness—but one time when the thorn has no sting— when the scorn bites not—when the sneer chafes not—when the pride and the spirit shrink not— K 2 when there is no wild passion to make every thing a storm and a conflagration among the senses— and that is—forgetfulness. I would that I could sleep—” and as he spoke, his head sunk upon the table with a heavy sound, as if unconsciousness had really come with the articulated wish. He started quickly, however, as now for the first time the presence of Dillon became obvious, and hurriedly thrusting the portrait into his vest, he turned quickly to the intruder, and sternly demanded the occasion of his interruption. The lieutenant was prepared, and at once replied to the interrogatory with the easy, blunt air of one who not only felt that he might be confided in, but who was then in the strict performance of his duties. “I came at your own call, captain. I have just returned from the river, and skirting down in that quarter, and was kept something later than I looked for; hearing, on my arrival, that you had been inquiring for me, I did not hesitate to present myself at once, not knowing but the business might be pressing.” “It is pressing,” responded the outlaw, seemingly well satisfied with the tacit apology. “It is pressing, Dillon, and you will have little time for rest before starting again. I myself have been riding all night, and shall be off in an hour again. But what have you to report? What's in the wind now?” “I hear but little, sir. There is some talk about a detachment of the Georgia Guard, something like a hundred men, to be sent out expressly for our benefit; but I look upon this as a mistake. Their eye is rather upon the miners, and the Indian gold lands and those who dig it, and not upon those who merely take it after it is gathered. I have heard, too, of something like a brush betwixt Fullam's troop and the miners at Tracy's diggings, but no particulars, except that the Guard got the worst of it.” “On that point I am already advised. That is well for us, since it will turn the eye of the authorities in a quarter in which we have little to do. I had some hand in that scrape myself, and set the dogs on with this object, and it is partly on this matter that I would confer with you, since there are some few of our men in the village who had large hands in it, who must not be hazarded, and must yet stay there.” “If the brush was serious, captain, that will be a matter of some difficulty; for of late, there has been so much of our business done, that government, I believe, has some thought of taking it up, and in order to do so without competition, will think of putting us down. Uncle Sam and the states, too, are quarrelling in the business, and, as I hear, there is like to be warm work between them. The Georgians are quite hot on the subject, and go where I will, they talk of nothing else than hanging the President, the Indians, and all the judges. They are brushing up their rifles, and they speak out plain.” “The more sport for us—but this is all idle. It will all end in talk, and, whether it does or not, we, at least, have nothing to do with it. But, there is drink—fill—and let us look to business before either of us sleep.” The lieutenant did as suggested by Rivers, who, rising from his seat, continued for some time to pace the apartment evidently in deep meditation. He suddenly paused, at length, and resuming his seat, inquired of Dillon as to the manner in which he had been employed through the last few days. A narration not necessary to repeat followed from the officer, in which the numerous petty details of frontier irregularity made up the chief material. Plots and counterplots were rife in his story, and more than once the outlaw interrupted his officer in the hope of abridging the petty particulars of some of their attenuated proportions—an aim not always successful, since among the numerous virtues of Lieutenant Dillon, that of precision and niceness in his statement of particulars must not be omitted. To this narration, however, though called for by himself, the superior yielded but little attention, until he proceeded to describe the adventure of the night, resulting so unsuccessfully, with the emigrating farmer. When he described the persons of the two strangers, so unexpectedly lending their aid in defence of the traveller, a new interest was awakened in the features and manner of his auditor, who here suddenly and with some energy of expression interrupted him, to make inquiries into particulars with regard to their dress and appearance, which not a little surprised Dillon, who had frequently experienced the aversion of his superior to all seemingly unnecessary minutiæ. Having been satisfied on these points, the outlaw rose, and pacing the apartment with slow steps, seemed to meditate some design which the narrative had suggested. Suddenly pausing, at length, as if all the necessary lights had shone in upon his deliberations at once, he turned to Dillon, who stood in silent waiting, and thus proceeded to detail the duties at present provided for him. “I have it,” said he, half-musingly, to his lieutenant. “I have it, Dillon—it must be so. How far, say you, is it from the place where the man— what's his name—encamped last night?” “Nine or ten miles, perhaps, or more.” “And you know his route for to-day?” “There is now but one which he can take, pursuing the route which he does.” “And upon that he will not go more than fifteen or twenty miles in the day. But not so with him —not so with him. He will scarcely be content to move at that pace, and there will be no hope in that way to overtake him.” Rivers spoke in soliloquy, and Dillon, though accustomed to many of the mental irregularities of his superior, exhibited something like surprise as he looked upon the lowering brows and unwonted indecision of the outlaw. “Of whom does the captain speak?” was his inquiry. “Of whom?—of him—of him!” was the rather abrupt response of the superior, who seemed to regard the ignorance of his lieutenant as to the object in view with almost as much wonder as that worthy entertained at the moment for the hallucinations of his captain. “Of whom should I speak—of whom should I think but the one—the thing accursed, fatal and singular, who—” and he stopped short, while his mind, now comprehending the true relationship between himself and the person beside him, which, in his moody self-examination, he had momentarily forgotten, proceeded to his designs with all of his wonted coherence. “I wander, Dillon, and am half-asleep. The fact is, I am almost worn out with this unslumbering motion. I have not been five hours out of the saddle in the last twenty-four, and it requires something more of rest, if I desire to do well what I have on hand—what, indeed, we both have on hand.” There was something apologetic in the manner, if not in the language, of the speaker; and his words seemed to indicate, if possible, an excuse for the incoherence of his address, in the physical fatigue which he had undergone—in this way to divert suspicion from those mental causes of excitement, of which, in the present situation, he felt some what ashamed. Pouring out a glass of liquor, and quaffing it without pause, he motioned to the lieutenant to do the same—a suggestion not possible for that person to misunderstand,—and then proceeded to narrate such portions of the late occurrences in and about the village as it was necessary that he should know. He carefully suppressed his own agency in any of these events, for, with the policy of the ancient, he had learned, at an early period in his life, to treat his friend as if he might one day become his enemy; and, so far as such a resolution might consistently be maintained while engaged in such an occupation as his, he rigidly observed it. “The business, Dillon, which I want you to execute, and to which you will give all your own attention, is difficult and troublesome, and requires ingenuity. You are to know, then, that Mark Forrester was killed last night, as is supposed, in a fray with a youth named Colleton, like himself a Carolinian. If such is not the opinion yet, I am determined such shall be the opinion; and have made arrangements by which the object will be attained. Of course the murderer should be taken, and I have reasons to desire that this object too should be attained. It is on this business, then, that you are to go. You must be the officer to take him.” “But where is he?—if within reach, you know there is no difficulty.” “Hear me—there is difficulty, though he is in reach. He is one of the men whom you found with the old farmer you would otherwise have attacked last night. There is difficulty, for he will fight like a wild beast, and stick to his ground like a rattlesnake; and, supported by the old fellow whom you found him with, he will be able to resist almost any force which you could muster on the emergency. The only fear I have, is, that being well-mounted, he will not keep with the company, but as they must needs travel slowly, he will go on and leave them.” “Should it not rather be a source of satisfaction than otherwise—will it not put him more completely at our disposal?” “No—for having so much the start of you, and a good animal, he will soon leave all pursuit behind him. There is a plan which I have been thinking of, and which will be the very thing, if at once acted upon. You know the sheriff, Maxson, lives on the same road,—you must take two of the men with you, pick fresh and good horses, set off to Maxson's at once with a letter which I shall give you, and he will make you special deputies for the occasion of this young man's arrest. I have arranged it so that the suspicion shall take the shape of a legal warranty, sufficient to authorize his arrest and detention. The proof of his offence will be matter of after consideration.” “But will Maxson do this—may he not refuse? You know he has been once before threatened with being brought up for his leaning towards some of us, in that affair of the Indian chief, Enakamon.” “He cannot—he dare not refuse!” said the outlaw, rising impatiently. “He holds his place and his life at my disposal, and he knows it. He will not venture to refuse me!” “He has been very scrupulous of late in all his dealings with us, you know, and has rather kept out of our way. Besides that, he has been thorough-going at several camp-meetings lately, and, when a man begins to appear over-honest, I think it high time he should be looked after by all parties.” “You are right, Dillon, you are right. I should not trust it to paper either. I will go myself. But you shall along with me, and on the way I will put you in a train for bringing out certain prisoners whom it is necessary that we should secure before the sitting of the court, and until it is over. They might be foolish enough to convict themselves and us of being more honest than their neighbours, and it is but humane to keep them from the commission of so sad an impropriety. Give orders for the best two of your troop, and have horses saddled for all four of us. We must be on the road, on the spot.” Dillon did as directed, and returned to the conference, which was conducted, on the part of his superior, with a degree of excitation and warmth, mingled with a sharp asperity of manner, something unwonted for him in the discussion and arranging of any mere matter of business. “Maxson will not refuse us; if he does, I will hang him by my saddle straps. The scoundrel owes his election to our votes, and shall he refuse us what we ask. He knows his fate too well to hesitate as to what he shall do.—And then, Dillon, when you have his commission for the arrest of this boy, spare not the spur: secure him at all hazards of horseflesh or personal inconvenience. He will not resist the laws, or any thing having their semblance; nor, indeed, has he any reason—” “No reason, sir—why, did you not say he had killed Forrester?” inquired his companion. “Your memory is sharp, master lieutenant—I did say, and I say so still. But he affects to think not, and I should not be at all surprised if he not only denies it to you, but in reality disbelieves it himself. Have you not heard of men who have learned in time to believe the lies of their own invention. Why not men doubt the truth of their own doings. There are such men, and he may be one of them. He may deny stoutly and solemnly the charge, but let him not deceive you or baffle your pursuit. We shall prove it upon him, and he shall hang, Dillon—ay, he shall hang, hang, hang— though it be under her very eyes!” It was in this way, that, in the progress of the dialogue which took place between the chief and his subordinate, the rambling malignity would break through the cooler counsels of the villain, and dark glimpses of the mystery of the transaction would burst upon the senses of the latter. Rivers had the faculty, however, seemingly intuitive, of never exhibiting too much of himself; and when hurried on by a passion seemingly too fierce and furious for restraint, he would suddenly curb himself in, while a sharp and scornful smile would curl his lips, as if he felt a consciousness, not only of his own powers of command, but of his impenetrability to all examination and analysis. The horses being now ready, the outlaw, buckling on his pistols, and hiding his dirk in his bosom, threw a huge dark cloak over his shoulders, which fully enveloped and concealed his person; and, in company with his lieutenant, and two stout men of his band, all admirably and freshly mounted, they proceeded to the abode of the sheriff, who, connected, though secretly, with Rivers and Munro, was indebted to them and the votes which in that region they could throw into the boxes, for his success in his elevation to the office which he held, and was, as might reasonably have been expected, a mere creature in their hands, and under their management. Maxson, of late days, however, Vol. II.—L whether from a reasonable apprehension, increasing duly with increasing years, that he might become at last so involved in the meshes of those crimes of his colleagues, from which, while he was compelled to share the risk, he was denied in great part the profit, had grown scrupulous—had avoided as much as possible their connexion; and the better to strengthen himself in the increasing favour of public opinion, had taken advantage of all those externals of morality and virtue which, unhappily, too frequently conceal qualities at deadly hostility with them. He had, in the popular phrase of the country “got religion;” and, like the worthy reformers of the Cromwell era, every thing which he did, and every thing which he said, had Scripture for its authority, or he had none of it. Psalm-singing commenced and ended the day in his house, and graces before meat and graces before sleep, prayers and ablutions, thanks givings and fastings, had so much thinned the animal necessities of his household, that a domestic war was the consequence, and the sheriff and the sheriff's lady held separate sway, having equally divided the dwelling between them, and ruling each their respective sovereignties with a most jealous watchfulness. All rights, not expressly delegated in the distribution of powers originally, were insisted on even to blood; and the arbitration of the sword, or rather the poker, once appealed to, most emphatically by the sovereign of the gentler sex, had cut off the euphonious utterance of one of the choicest paraphrases of Sternhold and Hopkins in the middle; and by splitting the scull of the reformed and reforming sheriff, had nearly rendered a new election necessary to the repose and well-being of the county in which they lived. But the worthy convert recovered, to the sore discomfiture of his spouse, and to the comfort and rejoicing of all true believers. The breach in his head was healed, but that which separated his family remained the same— “As rocks that had been rent asunder;” They knew the fellowship of man and wife only in so much as was absolutely essential to the keeping up of appearances to the public eye—a matter necessary to maintaining her lord in the possession of his dignity—which, as it conferred honour and profit, through him, upon her too, it was of necessity a part of her policy to continue. There had been a brush--a small gust had passed over that fair region of domestic harmony, on the very morning upon which the outlaw and his party rode up the untrimmed and half-over-grown avenue, which led to the house of the writ-server. There had been an amiable discussion between the two, as to which of them, with propriety, belonged the duty of putting on the breeches of their son Tommy, preparatory to his making his appearance at the breakfast-table. Some extraneous influence had that morning prompted the sheriff to resist the performance of a task which had now for some time been imposed upon him, and for which, therefore, there was the sanction of prescription and usage. It was an unlucky moment for the assertion of his manhood; for, a series of circumstances operating just about that time unfavourably upon the mind of his wife, she was in the worst possible humour upon which to try experiments. She heard the refusal of her liege to do the required duty, therefore, with an astonishment, not unmingled with a degree of pleasure, as it gave a full excuse for the venting forth upon him of those splenetic humours, which, for some time, had been growing and gathering in her system. The little sheriff, from long attendance on courts and camps, had acquired something more, perhaps, of the desire and disposition, than the capacity, to make long speeches and longer sermons, in the performance of both of which labours, however, he was admirably fortified by the technicals of the law, and the Bible phraseology. The quarrel had been waged for some time, and poor Tommy, the bone of contention, sitting all the while between the contending parties in a state of utter nudity, kept up a fine running accompaniment to the full tones of the wranglers, by crying bitterly for his breeches. For the first time for a long period of years, the lady found her powers of tongue fail in the proposed effect upon the understanding of her loving and legal lord; and knowing but of one other way to assail it, her hand at length grappling with the stool, from which she tumbled the breechless babe without scruple, seized upon an argument to which her adversary could oppose neither text nor technical; when, fortunately for him, the loud rapping of their early visiters at the outer door of the dwelling interposed between her wrath and its object, and spared the life of the devout sheriff for other occurrences. Bundling the naked child out of sight, the mother rushed into an inner apartment, shaking the stool in the pale countenance of her lord as she retreated, in a manner and with a significance which said, as plainly as words could say, that this temporary delay would only sharpen her appetite for vengeance, and exaggerate its terrors when the hour did arrive. It was with a hesitating step and wo-begone countenance, therefore, that the officer proceeded to his parlour, where a no less troublesome, but less awkward, trial awaited him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. “We come on warrant for your taking, sir, And do arrest you, as a dangerous man, Full of most foul design and traitorous thought, And hostile to our rule.” The high-sheriff made his appearance before his early and well-known visiters with a desperate air of composure and unconcern, the effort to attain which was readily perceptible to his companions. He could not, in the first place, well get rid of those terrors of the domestic world from which their interruption had timely shielded him; nor, on the other hand, could he feel altogether assured that the visit now paid him would not result in the exaction of some usurious interest. He had recently, as much through motives of worldly as spiritual policy, become an active religionist, in a small way, in and about the section of country in which he resided; and knowing that his professions were in some sort regarded with no small degree of doubt and suspicion by some of his brethren holding the same faith, he felt the necessity of playing a close and cautious game in all his practices. He might well be apprehensive, therefore, of the visits of those who never came but as so many omens of evil, and whose claims upon, and perfect knowledge of, his true character, were such, that he felt himself, in many respects, most completely at their mercy. Rivers did not give much time to preliminaries, but, after a few phrases of commonplace, coming L 2 directly to the point, he stated the business in hand, and demanded the assistance of the officer of justice for the arrest of one of its fugitives. There were some difficulties of form in the matter, which saved the sheriff in part, and which the outlaw had in great part overlooked. A warrant of arrest was necessary from some officer properly empowered to issue one, and a new difficulty was thus presented in the way of Colleton's pursuit. The sheriff had not the slightest objections to making deputies of the persons recommended by the outlaw, provided they were fully empowered to execute the commands of some judicial officer; beyond this, the scrupulous executioner of justice was unwilling to go; and having stood out so long in the previous controversy with his spouse, it was wonderful what a vast stock of audacious courage he now felt himself entitled, and ventured, to manifest. “I cannot do it, Master Guy—it's impossible— seeing, in the first place, that I han't any right by the laws to issue any warrant, though it's true, I has to serve them. Then, agin, in the next place, 'twont do for another reason that's jist as good, you see. It's only the other day, Master Guy, that the fear of the Lord come upon me, and I got religion; and now I've set myself up as a worker in other courts, you see, than those of man; and there be eyes around me that would see, and hearts to rejoice at the backslidings of the poor labourer. Howbeit, Master Guy, I am not the man to forget old sarvice; and if it be true that this man has been put to death in this manner, though I myself can do nothing at this time, I may put you in the way—for the sake of old time, and for the sake of justice, which requires that the slayer of his brother should also be slain—of having your wish.” Though something irritated still at the reluctance of his former creature to lend himself without scruple to his purposes, the outlaw did not hesitate to accept the overture, and to press for its immediate accomplishment. He had expostulated with the sheriff for some time on the point, and baffled and denied, he was very glad, at the conclusion of the dialogue with that worthy, to find that there was even so much of a prospect of concert, though falling far short of his original anticipations, from that quarter. He was too well aware, also, of the difficulty in the way of any proceeding without something savouring of authority in the matter; for, from a previous and rather correct estimate of Colleton's character, he well foresaw that, knowing his enemy, he would fight to the last against an arrest, which, under the forms of law and with the sanction of a known officer, he would otherwise readily recognise and submit to. Seizing, therefore, upon the speech of the sheriff, he eagerly availed himself of its opening to obtain those advantages in the affair, of which, from the canting spirit and newly-awakened morality of his late coadjutor, he had utterly begun to despair. He proceeded to reply to the suggestion as follows:— “I suppose I must content myself, Maxson, with doing in this thing as you say, though really I see not why you should now be so particular, for there are not ten men in the county who are able to determine upon any of your powers, or who would venture to measure their extent. Let us hear your plan, and I suppose it will be effectual in our object, and this is all I want. All I desire is, that our people, you know, should not be murdered by strangers without rhyme or reason.” The sheriff knew well the hypocrisy of the sentiment with which Rivers concluded, but made no remark. A single smile testified his knowledge of the nature of his colleague, and indicated his suspicion of a deeper and different motive for this new activity. Approaching the outlaw closely, he asked, in a half whisper:— “Who was the witness of the murder—who could swear for the magistrate? You must get somebody to do that.” This was another point which Rivers, in his impatience, had not thought to consider. But fruitful in expedient, his fertile mind suggested that ground of suspicion was all that the law required for apprehension at least, and having already arranged that the body of the murdered man should be found under certain circumstances, he contented himself with procuring commissions, as deputies, for his two officers, and posted away to the village. Here, as he anticipated, the intelligence had already been received—the body of Forrester had been found, and sufficient ground for suspicion to authorize a warrant was recognised in the dirk of the youth which, smeared with blood as it had been left by Rivers, had been found upon the body. Rivers had but little to do. He contrived, however, to do nothing himself. The warrant of Pippin, as magistrate, was procured, and the two officers, commissioned by the sheriff, went off in pursuit of the supposed murderer, against whom the indignation of all the village was sufficiently heightened by the recollection of the close intimacy existing between Ralph and Forrester, and the nobly characteristic manner in which the latter had volunteered to do his fighting with Rivers. The murdered man had, independent of this, no small popularity of his own, which brought out for him a warm and active sympathy highly creditable to his memory. Old Walton, too, suffered deeply, not less on his own, than his daughter's account. She, poor girl, had few words, and her sorrow, silent, if not tearless, was confined to the solitude of her own chamber. In the prosecution of the affair against Ralph, there was but one person whose testimony could have availed him, and that person was Lucy Munro. As the chief particular in evidence, and that which established the strong leading presumption against him, consisted in the discovery of his dagger alongside the body of the murdered man, and covered with his blood; it was evident that she who could prove the loss of the dagger by the youth, and its finding by Munro, prior to the event, and unaccompanied by any tokens of crime, would not only be able to free the person suspected, at least from this point of suspicion, but would be enabled to place its burden elsewhere, and with the most conclusive distinctness. This was a dilemma which Rivers and Munro did not fail to consider. The private deliberation, for an hour, of the two conspirators, determined upon the course which for mutual safety they were required to pursue; and Munro gave his niece due notice to prepare for an immediate departure with her aunt and himself, on some plausible pretence, to another portion of the country. To such a suggestion, as Lucy knew not the object, she offered no objection; and a secret departure was effected of the three, who, after a lonely ride of several hours through a route circuitously chosen to mislead, were safely brought to the sheltered and rocky abiding-place of the robbers, as we have already described it. Marks of its offensive features, however, had been so modified as not to occasion much alarm. The weapons of war had been studiously put out of sight, and apartments, distinct from those we have seen, partly the creation of nature, and partly of man, were assigned to the accommodation of the new comers. The outlaws had their instructions, and did not appear, though lurking and watching for ever around in close and immediate neighbourhood. Nor, in this particular alone, had the guilty parties made due provision for their future safety. The affair of the Guard had made more stir than had been anticipated in the rash moment which had seen its consummation; and their advices warned them of the approach of a much larger force of State troops, obedient to the direction of the district attorney, than they could well contend with. They determined, therefore, prudently for themselves, to keep as much out of the way of detection as they could; and to avoid those risks upon which a previous conference had partially persauded them to adventure. They were also apprized of the greater excitement attending the fate of Forrester, than could possibly have followed the death, in his place, of the contemplated victim: and adopting a habit of caution, heretofore but little considered in that region, they prepared for all hazards, and at the same time, tacitly determined upon the suspension of their numerous atrocities— at least, while a controlling force was in the neighbourhood. Previous impunity had led them so far, that at length the neighbouring country was aroused, and all the better classes, taking advantage of the excitement, grew bolder in the expression of their anger against those who had beset them so long. The sheriff, Maxson, had been something tutored by these influences, or, it had been fair to surmise, his scruples would have been less difficult to overcome. In the mean time, the pursuit of Ralph Colleton, as the murderer of Forrester, had been hotly urged by the officers. The pursuers knew the route, and having the control of new horses as they proceeded, at frequent intervals, gained of course at every step upon the unconscious travellers. We have seen the latter retiring to repose at a late hour of the night. Under the several fatigues which all parties had undergone, it is not strange that the sun should have arisen some little time before those who had not retired quite so early as himself. At a moderately late hour they breakfasted together—the family of the wagoner, and Ralph, and our old friend the pedler. Pursuing the same route, the two latter, after the repast, separated, with many acknowledgments on both sides, from the emigrating party, and pursued their way together. On their road, Bunce gave the youth a long and particular account of all those circumstances at the village inn by which he had been deprived of his chattels, and congratulated himself not a little on the adroit thought which had determined him to retain the good steed of the Lawyer Pippin in lieu of his losses. He spoke of it as quite a clever and creditable performance, and one as fully deserving the golden honours of the medal as many of those doings which are so rewarded. On this point his companion said little; and though he could not altogether comprehend the propriety of the pedler's morals, he certainly did not see but that the necessity and pressing danger of his situation somewhat sanctioned the deceit. He suggested this idea to Bunce, but when he came to talk of the propriety of returning the animal the moment he was fairly in safety, the speculator failed entirely to perceive the philosophy of his doctrine. The sheriff's officers came upon the wagoner a few hours after the two had separated from them. The intelligence received from him quickened their pace, and towards noon, they descried our two travellers ascending a hill a few hundred yards in advance of them. A repeated application of the spur brought them together, and, as had been anticipated by Rivers, Ralph offered not the slightest objection, when once satisfied of the legality of his arrest, to becoming their prisoner. But the consternation of Bunce was inexpressible. He endeavoured to shelter himself in the adjoining woods, and was quietly edging his steed into the covert for that purpose, on the first alarm, but was not permitted by the sharp eyes and ready unscrupulosity of the robber representatives of the law. They had no warrant, it is true, for the arrest of any other person than “the said Ralph Colleton”—but the unlucky colour of Pippin's horse, and their perfect knowledge of the animal, readily identifying him, did the business for the pedler. Under the custody of the laws, therefore, we behold the youth retracing his ground, horror-stricken at the death of Forrester—indignant at the suspicions entertained of himself as the murderer, but sanguine of the result, and firm and fearless as ever. Not so Bunce—there were cruel visions in his sight of seven-sided pine rails—fierce regulators—Lynch's law, and all that terrible paraphernalia of punishment, which is studiously arrayed in those regions for the enjoyment of evil-doers. The next day found them both securely locked up in the common jail of Chestatee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “I must go on, yet tremble—would shrink back, Yet dare not. 'Tis a good thought prompts me on, And let me stand to it. I may not lose, Whatever be the game. There are high powers That watch for the well-doing, and befriend.” The young mind of Colleton, excursive as it was, could scarcely realize to itself the strange and rapidly succeeding changes of the last few days. Shelf-exiled from the dwelling in which so much of his heart and hope had been stored up— a wanderer among the wandering—assaulted by ruffians—the witness of their crimes—pursued by the officers of justice, and finally the tenant of a prison, as a criminal himself! After the first emotions of astonishment and vexation had subsided— ignorant of the result of this last adventure, and preparing for the worst—he called for pen and paper, and briefly, to his uncle, recounted his adventures, as we have already related them, partially acknowledging his precipitance in departing from his house, but substantially insisting upon the propriety of those grounds which had made him do so. To Edith, what could he say? Nothing— every thing. His letter to her, enclosed in that to her uncle, was just such as might be expected from one with a character such as we have endeavoured to describe—that of the genuine aristocrat of Carolina—gentle, but firm—soothing, but manly—truly but loftily affectionate—the rock touched, if not softened, by the sunbeam. Warm and impetuous, Vol. II.—M but generally just in his emotions—liberal in his usual estimate of mankind, and generous, to a fault, in all his associations. Ignorant of any value in money, unless for high purposes—as subservient to taste and civilization—a graceful humanity, and an honourable affection. With a tenderness the most respectful, he reiterated his love—prayed for her prayers—frankly admitted his error in his abrupt flight, and freely promised atonement as soon as he should be freed from his difficulties; an event which, in speaking to her, he doubted not. This duty over, his mind grew somewhat relieved, and despatching a note by the jailer's deputy to the lawyer Pippin, he desired immediately to see him. Pippin had looked for such an invitation, and was already in attendance. His regrets were prodigious, but his gratification not less, as it would give him an opportunity, for some time desired, for serving so excellent a gentleman. But the lawyer shook his head with most professional uncertainty at every step of his own narration of the case, and soon convinced Ralph that he really stood in a very awkward predicament. He described the situation of the body of Forrester when found— the bloody dirk which lay beside it, having the initials of his name plainly carved upon it—his midnight flight—his close companionship with Forrester on the evening of the night in which he had been murdered—a fact proved by old Walton and his family—the intimate freedom with which Forrester had been known to confide his purposes to the youth, deducible from the joint call which they had made upon the sweetheart of the former—and many other smaller details, unimportant in themselves, but linked together with the rest of the particulars, strengthening the chain of circumstances against him to a degree which rendered it improbable that he should escape conviction. Pippin sought, however, to console his client, and, after the first development of particulars, the natural buoyancy of the youth returned. He was not disposed readily to despair, and his courage and confidence rose with the pressure of events. He entered into a plain story of all the particulars of his flight—the instrumentality of Miss Munro in that transaction, and which she could explain, in such a manner as to do away with any unfavourable impression which that circumstance, of itself, might create. Touching the dagger, he could say nothing. He had discovered its loss, but knew not at what time he had lost it. The manner in which it had been found was of course fatal, unless this fact could have been established; and for this the consulting parties saw no hope. Still, they did not despair, but proceeded to the task of preparing the defence for the day of trial, which was at hand. The technical portions of the case were managed by the lawyer, who issued his subpœnas—made voluminous notes—wrote out the exordium of his speech, and sat up all night committing it to memory. Having done all that the occasion called for in his interview with Ralph, the lawyer proceeded to visit, uncalled-for, one whom he considered a far greater criminal—the murder being proved—than his client. The cell to which the luckless pedler, Bunce, had been carried, was not far from that of the former, and the rapid step of the lawyer soon overcame the distance between. Never was man seemingly so glad to see his neighbour, as was Bunce, on this occasion, to look upon Pippin. His delight found words of the most honeyed description for his visiter, and his delight was truly infectious. The lawyer was delighted too, but his delight was of a far different origin. He had now some prospect of getting back his favourite steed —that fine animal, described by him elsewhere to the pedler, as one docile as a dog, and fleet as a deer. He had heard of the safety of his horse, and his anger with the pedler had undergone some abatement; but with the consciousness of power, as is the case with inferior minds, came a strong desire for its use. He knew that the pedler had been guilty in a legal sense of no crime—and could only be liable in a civil action for his breach of trust. But he suspected that the dealer in wares was ignorant of the advantageous distinctions in morals which the law had made, and consequently amused himself with playing upon the fears of the offender. He put on a countenance of much commiseration, and drawing a long sigh, regretted the necessity which had brought him to prepare the mind of his old friend for the last terrors of justice. But Bunce was not a man to be easily frightened. As he phrased it himself, he had been quite too long knocking about among men to be taken in by shadows, and replied stoutly—though really with some internal misgivings—to the lachrymalities of the learned counsel. He gave him to understand, that if he got into difficulty, he knew some other persons whom his confessions would make uncomfortable; and hinted pretty directly at certain practices of a certain professional gentleman, which, though the pedler knew nothing of the technical significant, might yet come under the head of barratry, and so forth. The lawyer was the more timid man of the two, and found it necessary to pare down his potency. He soon found it profitable to let the matter rest, and having made arrangements with the pedler for bringing suit for damages against two of the neighbouring farmers concerned in the demolition of his wares—who, happening to be less guilty than their accessories, had bentured to remain in the country,—Bunce found no difficulty in making his way out of the prison. There had been no right originally for his detention, but the consciousness of guilt, and some other ugly misgivings, had so relaxed the nerves of the tradesman, that he had never thought to inquire if his name were included in the warrant of arrest. It is probable that his courage and confidence would have been far less than it appears at present, had not Pippin assured him that the regulators were no longer to be feared—that the judge had arrived— that the grand jury had found bills against several of the offenders, and were still engaged in their labours—that a detachment of the state military had been ordered to the station—and that things looked as civil as it was altogether possible for such warlike exhibition to make them. It is surprising to think how fearlessly uncompromising was the conduct of Bunce under this new condition of affairs. But the pedler, in his own release from custody, was not forgetful of his less fortunate companion. He was a frequent visiter in the dungeon of Ralph Colleton,—bore all messages between the prisoner and his counsel, and contributed, by his shrewd knowledge of human kind, not a little to the material out of which his defence was to be made. He suggested the suspicion never before entertained by the youth, or entertained for a moment only, that his present arrest was the result of a scheme purposely laid with a reference to this end; and did not scruple to charge upon Rivers the entire management of the matter. Ralph could only narrate what he knew of the malignant hatred of the outlaw to himself—another fact which none but Lucy Munro could establish. Her evidence, however, M 2 would only prove Rivers to have meditated one crime; it would not free him from the imputation of having committed another. Still, so much was important, and casualties were to be relied upon for the rest. But what was the horror of all parties when it was known that neither Lucy nor any of the landlord's family were to be found. The process of subpœna was returned, and the general opinion was, that, alarmed at the approach of the military in such force, and confident that his agency in the late transactions could not long remain concealed in the possession of so many, though guilty like himself, Munro had fled to the west. The mental agony of the youth, when thus informed, cannot well be conceived. He was, for a time, utterly prostrate, and gave himself up to despair. The entreaties of the pedler, and the counsels and exhortings of the lawyer, failed equally to enliven him; and they had almost come to adopt his gloomy resignation, when, as he sat on his low bench, with head drooping on his hand, a solitary glance of sunshine fell through the barred window —the only one assigned to his cell. The smile of God, himself, that solitary ray appeared to the diseased spirit of the youth, and he grew strong in an instant. Talk of the lessons of the learned, and the reasonings of the sage—a vagrant breeze, a rippling water, a glance of the sweet sunlight, have more of consolation in them for the sad heart, than all the pleadings of philosophy. They bear the missives of a higher teacher. Bunce was an active coadjutor with the lawyer in this melancholy case. He made all inquiries— he went everywhere. He searched in all places, and spared no labour, but at length despaired. Nothing could be elicited by his inquiries, and he ceased to hope, himself, and ceased to persuade Ralph into hope. The lawyer shook his head in reply to all questions, and put on a look of mystery which is the safety-valve to all swollen pretenders. In this state of affairs, taking the horse of the youth, with a last effort at discoveries, Bunce rode forth into the surrounding country. He had heretofore taken all the common routes, to which, in his previous intercourse with the people, he had been accustomed; he now determined to strike into a path scarcely perceptible, and one which he never remembered to have seen before. He followed, mile after mile, its sinuosities. It was a wild, and, seemingly, an untrodden region. The hills shot up jaggedly from the plain around him—the fissures were rude and steep—more like embrasures, blown out by sudden power from the solid rock. Where the forest appeared, it was dense and intricate—abounding in brush and underwood; where it was deficient, the blasted heath chosen by the witches in Macbeth would have been no unfit similitude. Hopeless of human presence in this dreary region, the pedler yet rode on, as if to dissipate the unpleasant thoughts following upon his frequent disappointment. Suddenly, however, a turn in the winding path brought him in contact with a strange-looking figure, not more than five feet in height, neither boy nor man, uncouthly habited, and seemingly one to whom all converse but that of the trees and rocks, during his whole life, had been unfamiliar. The reader has already heard something of the Cherokee pony—it was upon one of these animals he rode. They are a small, but compactly made and hardy creature—of great fortitude, stubborn endurance, and an activity, which, in the travel of day after day, will seldom depart from the gallop. It was the increasing demand for these animals that had brought into existence and exercise a company, which, by a transition far from uncommon, passed readily from the plundering of horses to the cutting of throats and purses; scarcely discriminating in their reckless rapacity between the several degrees of crime in which such a practice involved them. Though somewhat uncouth in appearance, the new-comer seemed decidedly harmless—nay, almost idiotic in appearance. His smile was pleasant, though illuminating features of the ruggedest description, and the tones of his voice were even musical in the ears of the pedler, to whom any voice would probably have seemed so in that gloomy region. He very sociably addressed Bunce in the patois of that section, and the ceremonial of introduction, without delay or difficulty, was overcome duly on both sides. In the southern wilderness, indeed, it does not call for much formality, nor does a strict adherence to the received rules of etiquette become at all necessary, to make the traveller “hail fellow well met.” Any thing, in that quarter, savouring of reserve or stiffness, is punished with decided hostility or openly avowed contempt; and, in the more rude regions, the refusal to partake in the very social employments of wrestling or whiskey-drinking, has brought the scrupulous personage to the more questionable enjoyments of a regular gouging match and fight. A demure habit is the most unpopular among all classes. Freedom of manner, on the other hand, obtains confidence readily, and the heart is won, at once, by an offhanded familiarity of demeanour, which fails to recognise any inequalities in human condition. The society and the continued presence of nature, as it were, in her own peculiar abode, puts aside all merely conventional distinctions, and men meet upon a common footing. Thus, even when perfect strangers to one another, after the usual preliminaries of “how are you, friend,” or “strannger?”— “whare from?”—“whare going?”—“fair” or “foul weather”—as the case may be—the acquaintance is established, and familiarity well begun. Such was the case in the present instance. Bunce knew the people well, and exhibited his most unreluctant manner. The horses of the two, in like manner with their masters, made similar overtures; and, in a little while, their necks were drawn in lines parallel to each other. Bunce was less communicative, however, than the stranger. Still his head and heart, alike, were full, and he talked more freely than was altogether consistent with his Yankee character. He told of Ralph's predicament, and the clown sympathized; he narrated the quest which had brought him forth, and of his heretofore unrewarded labours; concluding with naming the ensuing Monday as the day of the youth's trial, when, if nothing in the mean time could be discovered of the true criminal—for the pedler never for a moment doubted that Ralph was innocent—he “mortally feared things would go again him.” “That will be hard, too—a mighty tough difficulty, now, strannger—to be hanged for other folks' doings. But, I reckon, he'll have to make up his mind to it.” “Oh, no! don't say so, now, friend, I beg you. What makes you think so?” said the anxious pedler. “Why, only from what I heer'd you say. You said so yourself, and I believed it as if I had seed it,” was the reply of the simple countryman. “Oh, yes. It's but a poor chance with him now, I guess. I'd a notion that I could find out some little particular, you see—” “No, I don't see.” “To be sure you don't, but that's my say. Everybody has a say, you know.” “No, I don't know.” “To be sure, of course you don't know, but that's what I tell you. Now you must know—” “Don't say must to me, strannger, if you want that we shall keep hands off. I don't let any man say must to me.” “No harm, friend—I didn't mean any harm,” said the worried pedler, not knowing what to make of his acquaintance, who spoke understandingly, though in language which left the fact doubtful. Avoiding all circumlocution of phrase, and dropping the “you sees,” and “you knows” from his narration, he proceeded to state his agency in procuring testimony for the youth, and of the ill success which had hitherto attended him. At length, in the course of his story, which he contrived to tell with as much caution as came within the scope of his education, he happened to speak of Lucy Munro, but had scarcely mentioned her name when his queer companion interrupted him:— “Look you, strannger, I'll lick you now, off-hand, if you don't put Miss for a handle to the gal's name. She's Miss Lucy. Don't I know her, and han't I seen her, and isn't it I, Chub Williams, as they calls me, that loves the very airth she treads?” “You know Miss Lucy?” inquired the pedler, enraptured even at this moderate discovery, though carefully coupling the prefix to her name while giving it utterance—“now, do you know Miss Lucy, friend, and will you tell me where I can find her?” “Do you think I will, and you may be looking arter her too? Drot my old hat, strannger, but I do itch to git at you.” “Oh, now, Mr. Williams—” “I won't answer to that name. Call me Chub Williams, if you wants to be polite. Mother always called me Chub, and that's the reason I like it.” “Well, Chub,”—said the other, quite paternally— “I assure you I don't love Miss Munro—and—” “What! you don't love Miss Lucy. Why, everybody ought to love her. Now, if you don't love her, I'll hammer you, strannger, off-hand.” The poor pedler professed; and satisfied, after a while, the scruples of one who, in addition to deformity, he also discovered to labour under the more serious curse of partial idiocy. Having done this, and flattered, in sundry other ways, the peculiarities of his companion, he pursued his other point with laudable pertinacity. He at length got from Chub his own history: how he had run into the woods with his mother, who had suffered from the ill treatment of her husband: how, with his own industry, he had sustained her wants, and supplied her with all the comforts which a long period had required; and how, dying, at length, she had left him—the forest boy—alone, to pursue those toils which heretofore had an object, while she yielded him in return for them society and sympathy. These particulars, got from him in a manner the most desultory, were made to preface the more important parts of the narrative. It appears that his harmlessness had kept him undisturbed, even by the wild marauders of that region, and that he still continued to procure a narrow livelihood by his woodland labours, and sought no association with that humanity which, though among fellow-creatures, would still have lacked of fellowship for him. In the transfer of Lucy from the village to the shelter of the outlaws, he had obtained a glimpse of her person and form, and had ever since been prying in the neighbourhood for a second and similar enjoyment. He now made known to the pedler her place of concealment, which he had, some time before this event, himself discovered; but which, through dread of Rivers, for whom he seemed to entertain an habitual fear, he had never ventured to penetrate. “Well, I must see her,” exclaimed Bunce. “I an't afraid, 'cause, you see, Mr. Williams—Chub, I mean, it's only justice, and to save the poor gentleman's life. I'm sure I oughtn't to be afraid, and no more I an't. Won't you go there with me, Chub?” “Can't think of it, stranger. Guy is a dark man, and mother said I must keep away when he rode in the woods. Guy don't talk—he shoots.” The pedler made sundry efforts to procure a companion for his adventure; but finding it vain, and determined to do right, he grew more resolute with the necessity, and, contenting himself with claiming the guidance of Chub, he went boldly on the path. Having reached a certain point in the woods, after a very circuitous departure from the main track, the guide pointed out to the pedler a long and rude ledge of rocks, so seeming to the glance that none could have ever conjectured to find them the abode of any thing but the serpent and the wolf. Chub gave him his directions, then alighting from his nag, which he concealed in a clump of neighbouring brush, hastily and with the agility of a monkey ran up a neighbouring tree which overhung the prospect. Bunce, left alone, grew somewhat staggered with his fears. He now half-repented of the self-imposed adventure; wondered at his own rash humanity, and might perhaps have utterly foreborne the trial, but for a single consideration. His pride was concerned, that the deformed Chub should not have occasion to laugh at his weakness. Descending, therefore, from his horse, he fastened him to the hanging branch of a neighbouring tree, and with something of desperate defiance in his manner, resolutely advanced to the silent and forbidding mass of rocks, which rose up so silently around him. In another moment, and he was lost to sight in the gloomy shadow of the entrance-passage pointed out to him by the half-witted, but not altogether ignorant, Chub.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “They have thee in their gripe, but fear thou not— The darkness is thy shelter, and the night, That's but a gloom to guilt, hath many a beam To bless and guide the true and innocent.” But the preparations of Bunce had been foreseen and provided for by those most deeply interested in his progress; and scarcely had the worthy tradesman effected his entrance fairly into the forbidden territory, when he felt himself grappled from behind. He struggled with an energy, due as much to the sudden terror as to any exercise of the free will; but he struggled in vain. The arms that were fastened about his own, bound them down with a grasp of steel; and after a few moments of desperate effort, accompanied with one or two exclamations, half surprise, half expostulation, of “Hello, friend, what do you mean—” and, “I say, now, friend, you'd better have done—” the Vol. II.—N struggle ceased, and he lay supine in the hold of the unseen person or persons—for there were more than one—who had secured him. These persons he could not then discern—the passage was cavernously dark, and had evidently been as much the work of nature as of art. A handkerchief was fastened about his eyes, and he felt himself carried on the shoulders of those who made nothing of the burden. After the progress of several minutes, in which the anxiety natural to his situation led Bunce into frequent exclamations and entreaties, he was set down, and a buzzing dialogue, as of several persons, having first taken place around him, the bandage was removed from his eyes, and he was once more permitted their free exercise. To his great wonder, however, nothing but women, of all sizes and ages, met his sight. In vain did he look around for the men who brought him. They were no longer to be seen, and so silent had been their passage out, that the unfortunate pedler was compelled to satisfy himself with the belief, that persons of the gentler sex had been in truth his captors. Had he, indeed, given up the struggle so easily? The thought was mortifying enough, and yet, when he looked around him, he grew more satisfied with his own efforts at resistance. He had never seen such strongly built women in his life; scarcely one of them but could easily have overthrown him, without stratagem, in single combat. The faces of many of them were familiar to him but where had he seen them before? His memory failed him utterly, and he gave himself up to his bewilderment. He looked around, and the scene was well calculated to affect a nervous mind. It was a fit scene for the painter of the supernatural. The small apartment in which they were was formed in great part from the natural rock; where a fissure presented itself, a huge pine tree, overthrown so as to fill the vacuity, completed what nature had left undone; and, bating the one or two rude cavities left here and there in the sides—themselves so covered as to lie hidden from all without—there was all the compactness of a regularly constructed dwelling. A single and small lamp, pendant from a beam that hung over the room, gave a feeble light, which, taken in connexion with that borrowed from without, served only to make visible the dark indistinct of the place. With something dramatic in their taste, the old women had dressed themselves in sombre habiliments, according with the general unique of all things around them; and, as the unfortunate pedler continued to gaze in wonderment, his fear grew with every progressive step in his observation. One by one, however, the old women commenced stirring, and, as they moved, now before and now behind him—his eyes following them on every side—he at length discovered, amid the group, the small and delicate form of the very being for whom he sought. There, indeed, was Lucy Munro and her aunt, holding a passive character in the strange assembly. This was encouraging; and Bunce, forgetting his wonder in the satisfaction which such a prospect afforded him, endeavoured to force his way forward to them, when a salutary twitch of the arm from one of the beldame troop, by tumbling him backwards upon the floor of the cavern, brought him again to a consideration of his predicament. He could not be restrained from speech, however, though, as he spoke, the old women saluted his face on all hands with strokes from brushes of fern, which occasioned him no small inconvenience. But he had gone too far now to recede, and in a broken manner—broken as much by his own hurry and vehemence as by the interruptions to which he was subjected —he contrived to say enough to Lucy of the situation of Colleton to revive in her an interest of the most painful character. She rushed forward, and was about to ask more from the beleaguered pedler; but it was not the policy of those having both of them in charge to permit such a proceeding. One of the stoutest of the old women now came prominently upon the scene, and with a rough voice, which it is not difficult to recognise as that of Munro, commanded the young girl away, and gave her in charge to two attendants. But she struggled still to hear, and Bunce all the while speaking, she was enabled to gather most of the particulars in his narration before her removal was effected. The mummery had ceased, and Bunce having been carried elsewhere, the maskers resumed their native apparel, having thrown aside that which had been put on for a distinct purpose. The pedler, in another and more secure department of the robber's hiding-place, was solaced with the prospect of a long and dark imprisonment. In the mean time, our little friend Chub Williams had been made to undergo his own distinct punishment for his share in the adventure. No sooner had Bunce been laid by the heels, than Rivers, who had directed the whole, advanced from the shelter of the cave, in company with his lieutenant, Dillon, both armed with rifles, and without saying a word, singling out the tree on which Chub had perched himself, took deliberate aim at the head of the unfortunate urchin. He saw the danger in an instant, and his first words were characteristic. “Now don't—don't, now, I tell you, Mr. Guy— you may hit Chub.” “Come down, then, you rascal,” was the reply, as with a laugh, lowering the weapon, he awaited the descent of the spy. “And now, Bur, what have you to say that I shouldn't wear out a hickory or two upon you?” “My name an't Bur, Mr. Guy—my name is Chub, and I don't like to be called out of my name. Mother always called me Chub.” “Well, Chub—since you like it best, though at best a bur,—what were you doing in that tree. How dare you spy into my dwelling, and send other people there? Speak, or I'll skin you alive.” “Now, don't, Mr. Guy. Don't, I beg you. 'Taint right to talk so, and I don't like it. But is that your dwelling, Mr. Guy, in truth. You really live in it, all the year round? Now, you don't, do you?” The outlaw had no fierceness when contemplating the object before him. Strange nature! He seemed to regard the deformities of mind and body, in the outcast under his eyes, as something kindred. Was there any thing like sympathy in such a feeling; or was it rather that perversity of temper, which sometimes seemes to cast an ennobling feature over violence, and to afford, here and there, a touch of that moral sunshine, which can now and then give an almost redeeming expression to the countenance of vice itself. He contemplated the idiot for a few moments with a close eye, and a mind evidently busied in thought. Laying his hand, at length, on his shoulder, he was about to speak, when the deformed started back from the touch as if in horror—a feeling, indeed, fully visible in every feature of his face. “Now, don't touch Chub, Mr. Guy. Mother said you were a dark man, and told me to keep N 2 clear of you. Don't touch me again, Mr. Guy; I don't like it.” The outlaw, musingly, spoke to his lieutenant— “And this is education—who shall doubt its importance—who shall say that it does not overthrow, and altogether destroy the original nature. The selfish mother of this miserable outcast, fearing that he might be won away from his service to her, taught him to avoid all other persons, and even those who had treated her with kindness were thus described to this poor dependant. To him the sympathies of others would have been the greatest blessing, yet she so tutored him, that, at her death, he was left desolate. You hear his account of me, gathered, as he says, and as I doubt not, from her own lips. That account is true, so far as my other relationships with mankind are concerned; but not true as regards my connexions with her. I furnished that old creature when she was starving, and when this boy, sick and impotent, could do little for her service. I never uttered a harsh word in her ears, or treated her unkindly, yet this is the character she gives of me, and this, indeed, the character which she has given of all others. A feeling of the narrowest selfishness has led her deliberately to misrepresent all mankind; and has been productive of a more ungracious result, in driving one from his species, who, more than any other, stands in need of their sympathy and association.” While Rivers spoke thus, the idiot listened with an air of the most stupid attention. His head fell on one shoulder, and one hand partially sustained it. As the former concluded his remarks, Chub recovered a posture as nearly erect as possible, and remarked, with as much significance as could comport with his general expression,—“Chub's mother was good to Chub, and Mr. Guy mustn't say nothing agin her.” “But, Chub, will you not come and live with me? I will give you a good rifle—one like this, and you shall travel everywhere with me.” “You will beat Chub when you are angry, and make him shoot people with the rifle. I won't have the rifle. I don't want it. If folks say harm to Chub, he can lick them with his fists. Chub don't want to live with you.” “Well, as you please. But come in and look at my house, and see where I live.” “And shall I see the strannger agin? I can lick him, and I told him so. But he called me Chub, and I made friends with him.” “Yes, you shall see him, and—” “And Miss Lucy too—I want to see Miss Lucy —Chub saw her, and she spoke to Chub yesterday.” The outlaw promised him all, and after this there was no farther difficulty. The unconscious idiot scrupled no longer, and followed his conductors into—prison. It was necessary, for the farther safety of the outlaws in their present abode, that such should be the case. The secret of their hiding-place was in the possession of quite too many; and the subject of deliberation among the leaders was now into the propriety of its continued tenure. The country, they felt assured, would soon be overrun with the State troops. They had no fears of discovery from this source, prior to the affair of the massacre of the Guard, which rendered necessary the secretion of many in their retreat, who, before that time, were perfectly unconscious of its existence. In addition to this, it was now known to the pedler and the idiot, neither of whom had any reason for secrecy on the subject in the event of their being able to make it public. The difficulty, with regard to the two latter, subjected them to some small risk of suffering from the ultimate resource of roguery; but so much blood had been already spilt, that the sense of the majority revolted at the farther resort to that degree of violence, particularly, too, when it was recollected that they could only hold their citadel for a certain and short period of time. It was determined, therefore, that as long as they themselves continued in their hiding-place, that Bunce and Chub should, perforce, continue their prisoners. Having so determined, and made their arrangements accordingly, the two last made captives were assigned a cell, chosen with reference to its greater security than the other portions of their hold; and sufficiently tenacious of its trust, it would seem, to have answered well its purpose. In the mean time the sufferings of Lucy Munro were such as may well be understood from the character of her feelings, as we have heretofore surveyed their expression. In her own apartment —her cell, we may style it, for she was in some sort of honourable bondage, she brooded with deep melancholy over the narrative given by the pedler. She had no reason to doubt its correctness, and the more she meditated upon it, the more acute became her misery. But a day intervened, and the trial of Ralph Colleton must take place, and without her evidence, she was well aware there could be no hope of his escape from the doom of felony— from the death of shame and physical agony. The whole picture grew up before her excited fancy— she beheld the assembled crowd—she saw him borne to execution, and her senses reeled beneath the terrible conjurations of her fancy. She threw herself prostrate upon her couch, and strove not to think, but in vain. The mind, still active, maddened, and she grew conscious herself—the worst of all kinds of consciousness—that reason was no longer secure in her sovereignty; and with a strong effort of the still firm will, she strove rather to discover the best mode of defeating the awful fate, and rescuing the victim from the death suspended above him—and she succeeded, while deliberating on such means, in quieting the more subtle workings of her imagination. Many were the thoughts which came into her brain in this examination. At one time she thought it not impossible to convey a letter, in which her testimony should be carefully set down; but the difficulty of procuring a messenger, and the doubt that such a statement would prove of any avail, decided her to seek for other means. An ordinary mind and a moderate degree of interest in the fate of the individual would have contented itself with some such step; but such a mind and such affections were not those of the high-souled and spirited Lucy. She dreaded not personal danger, and to rescue the youth, whom she so much idolized, from the doom that threatened him, she would have willingly dared to encounter that fate itself, in its darkest forms. She determined, therefore, to rely chiefly upon herself in all efforts which she could make for the purpose in view; and her object, therefore, was to effect a return to the village in time to appear at the trial. Yet how should this be done? She felt herself to be a captive: she knew the restraints upon her—and did not doubt that all her motions were sedulously observed. How then should she proceed? An agent was necessary; and, while thus deliberating with herself upon the difficulty thus assailing her at the outset, her ears were drawn to the distinct utterance of sounds, as of persons engaged in conversation, from the adjoining section of the rock. One of the voices appeared familiar, and at length she distinctly made out her own name in various parts of the dialogue. She soon distinguished the nasal tones of the pedler, whose prison adjoined her own, separated only by a huge wall of earth and rock, the rude and jagged sides of which had been made complete, where naturally imperfect for the purposes of a wall, by the free use of clay, which, plastered in huge masses into the crevices and every fissure, was no inconsiderable apology for the more perfect structures of civilization. Satisfied, at length, that the two so confined were friendly, she contrived to make them understand her contiguity, by speaking in tones sufficiently low as to be unheard beyond the apartment in which they were. In this way she was enabled to converse with the pedler, to whom all her difficulties were suggested, and to whom she did not hesitate to say that she knew that which would not fail to save the life of Colleton. Bunce was not slow to devise various measures for the further promotion of the scheme, none of which, however, served the purpose of showing to either party how they should get out, and but for the ingenuity of the idiot, it is more than probable, despairing of success, they would at length have thrown aside the hope of doing any thing for the youth as perfectly illusory. But Chub came in as a prime auxiliar. From the first moment in which he heard the gentle tones of Lucy's voice, he had busied himself with his long nails and long fingers in removing the various masses of clay which had been made to fill up the sundry crevices of the intervening wall, and had so far succeeded as to detach a large square of the rock itself, which, with all possible pains and caution, he lifted from the embrasure. This done, he could distinguish objects, though dimly, from one apartment in the other, and thus introduced the parties to a somewhat nearer acquaintance with one another. Having done so much, he reposed from his labours, content with a sight of Lucy, on whom he continued to look with a fixed and stupid admiration. He had pursued this work so noiselessly, and the maiden and Bunce had been so busily employed in discussing their several plans, that they had not observed the vast progress which Chub had made towards furnishing them with a better solution of their difficulties than any of their own previous cogitations. When Bunce saw how much had been done in one quarter, he applied himself resolutely to similar experiments on the opposite wall: and had the satisfaction of discovering that, as a dungeon, the dwelling in which they were required to remain was sadly deficient in some few of the requisites of security. With the aid of a small pick of iron, which Lucy handed him from her cell, he pierced the outer wall in several places, in which the clay had been required to do the offices of the rock, and had the satisfaction of perceiving, from the sudden influx of light in the apartment, succeeding his application of the instrument, that, with a small labour and in little time, they should be enabled to effect their escape, at least into the free air, and under the more genial vault of heaven. Having made this discovery, it was determined that nothing more should be done until night, and having filled up the apertures which they had made, with one thing or another, they proceeded to consult, with more deliberate composure, on the future progress. It was arranged that the night should be permitted to set in fairly—that Lucy should retire early, having first been studious that Munro and her aunt, with whom she more exclusively consorted—Rivers having altogether kept out of sight since her removal—should see her at the evening meal, without any departure from her usual habits. Bunce undertook to officiate as a guide, and as Chub expressed himself willing to do whatever Miss Lucy should tell him, it was arranged that he should remain, occasionally making himself heard in his cell, as if in conversation, for as long a period after their departure as might be thought necessary to put them sufficiently in advance of any pursuit—a requisition to which Chub readily gave his consent. He was the only one of the party who appeared to regard the whole matter with comparative indifference. He knew that a man was in danger of his life—he felt that he himself was in prison, and he said he would rather be out among the pine trees—but there was no rush of feeling, such as troubled the heart of the young girl, whose spirit, clothing itself in all the noblest habiliments of manhood, lifted her up into the choicest superiority of character—nor had he that anxiety to do a service to his fellow, which made the pedler throw aside some of his more wordly characteristics—he did simply as he was bid, and had no further care. Miss Lucy, he said, talked sweetly, like his mother, and Chub would do for Miss Lucy any thing that she asked him. The principle of his government was simple, and having chosen a sovereign he did not withhold his obedience. Thus stood the preparations of the three prisoners, when darkness— long looked-for, and hailed with trembling emotions —at length came down over the silent homestead of the outlaws.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “Speed, scour the woods around—let none escape, Or all is perill'd—yet forbear to strike: Bind them with cords, and see them well secured, But harm ye not their lives.” The night gathered a pace, and the usual hour of repose had come. Lucy retired to her apartment with a trembling heart, but a courageous spirit, full of a noble determination to persevere in her project. Though full of fear, she never for a moment thought of retreat from the decision which she had made. Her character afforded an admirable model for the not unfrequent union of shrinking delicacy with manly and efficient firmness. Munro and Rivers, having first been assured that all was quiet, by a ramble which they took around their hiding-place, returned to the little chamber of the latter, such as we have described it in a previous portion of our narrative, and proceeded to the further discussion of their plans. The mind of the landlord was very ill at ease. He had arrived at that time of life when repose and a fixed habitation become necessary; and when, whatever may have been the habits of earlier manhood, the mind ceases to crave the excitements of adventure, and foregoes, or would fain forego, all its roving characteristics. To this state of feeling had he come, and the circumstances which now denied him the fruition of that prospect of repose which he had been promising himself so long, were regarded with no little restlessness and impatience. Vol. II.—O At the moment, they could make no positive arrangements for the future. Munro was loath to give up the property which, in one way or other, he had acquired in the neighbourhood, and which it was impossible for him to remove to any other region; and, strange to say, a strong feeling of inhabitiveness—the love of home—if home he could be thought to have anywhere, might almost be considered a passion with his less scrupulous companion. Thus situated, they lingered on in the hope that the military would soon be withdrawn from the neighbourhood, as it could only be maintained at great expense by the State; and then, as the country was but nominally settled, and so sparsely as to scarcely merit any consideration, they felt assured that they might readily return to their old, or any practices, and without any further apprehension. The necessity, however, which made them thus deliberate, had the effect, at the same time, of impressing them with a gloomy spirit, not common to either of them. “Let us see, Munro—there is, after all, less to apprehend than we first thought. In a week, and the court will be over—in another week and the Guard will be withdrawn, and for this period only will it be necessary that we should keep dark. I think we are now perfectly safe where we are. The only persons who know of our retreat, and might be troublesome, are safe in our possession. They will hardly escape until we let them, and before we do so we shall first see that they can give us no further necessity for caution. Of our own party, none are permitted to know the secrets of our hiding-place, but those in whom we may trust confidently. I have taken care to provide for the doubtful at some distance in the adjoining woods, exaggerating so greatly the danger of exposure, that they will hardly venture to be seen under any circumstances and by anybody. Once let these two weeks go over, and I have no fears—we shall have no difficulties then.” “And what's to be done with the pedler and the fool? I say, Guy, there must be no more blood— I will not agree to it. The fact is, I feel more and more dismal every day since that poor fellow's death; and now that the youngster's taken, the thought is like fire in my brain, which tells me he may suffer for our crime.” “Why, you are grown parson. Would you go and save him, by giving up the true criminal? I shall look for that after this, and consider myself no longer in safety. If you go on in this manner, I shall begin to meditate an off-hand journey to the Mississippi.” “Ay, and the sooner we all go the better— though, to be plain, Guy—let this affair once blow over, and I care not to go with you any longer. We must then cut loose for ever. I am not a good man, I know—any thing beside; but you have carried me on, step by step, until I am what I am afraid to name to myself. You found me a rogue—you have made me a —” “Why do you hesitate? Speak it out, Munro —it is a large step gained towards reform when we learn to name truly our offences to ourselves.” “I dare not. The thought is sufficiently horrible without the thing. I hear some devil whispering it too frequently in my ears, to venture upon its utterance myself. But you—how you can live without feeling it, after your experience, which has been so much more dreadful than mine, I know not.” “I do feel it, Munro, but have long since ceased to fear it. The reiteration takes away the terror which is due rather to the novelty than to the offence. But when I began, I felt it. The first sleep I had after the affair of Jessup was full of tortures. The old man, I thought, lay beside me in my bed; his blood run under me, and clotted around me, and fastened me there, while his gashed face kept peering into mine, and his eyes danced over me with the fierce light of a threatening comet. The dream nearly drove me mad, and mad I should have been had I gone to my prayers. I knew that, and chose a different course for relief.” “What was that?” “I sought for another victim as soon after as I conveniently could. The one spectre superseded the other, until all vanished. They never trouble me now—though sometimes, in my waking moments, I have met them on the road side—glaring at me from bush or tree, until I shouted at them fiercely, and then they were gone. These are my terrors, and they do sometimes unman me.” “They would do more with me; they would destroy me on the spot. But, let us no more of this. Let us rather see if we cannot do something towards making our visions more agreeable. Do you persevere in the sacrifice of this youngster. Must he die?” “Am I a child, Walter Munro, that you ask me such a question? Must I again tell over the accursed story of my defeat and of his success? Must I speak of my thousand defeats—of my overthrown pretensions—my blasted hopes, where I had set my affections—upon which every feeling of my heart had been placed? Must I go over a story so full of pain and humiliation—must I describe my loss, in again placing before your eyes a portraiture like this? Look, man, look—and read my answer in the smile, which, denying me, provides me, in this case, with a denial as immutable as hers.” He placed before his companion the miniature of Edith, which he took from his bosom, where he seems carefully to have treasured it. He was again the envenomed and the excited savage which we have elsewhere seen him, and in which mood Munro knew well that nothing could be done with him in the shape of argument or entreaty. He went on:— “Ask me no questions, Munro, so idle, so perfectly unnecessary as this. Fortune has done handsomely here. He falls through me, yet falls by the common hangman. What a double blow is this to both of them. I have been striving to imagine their feelings, and such a repast as that effort has procured me—I would not exchange it— no—not for worlds—for nothing less, Munro, than my restoration back to that society—to that place in society, from which my fierce passions, and your cruel promptings, and the wrongs of society itself, have for ever exiled me.” “And would you return, if you could do so?” “To-morrow—to-night—this instant. I am sanguinary, Munro—revengeful—fierce—all that is bad, because I am not permitted to be better. My pride—my strong feelings and deeply absorbing mood—these have no other field for exercise. The love of home—the high ambition, which, had society done me common justice, and had not, in enslaving itself, dishonoured and defrauded me— would, under other circumstances, have made me a patriot. My pride is even now to command the admiration of men—I never sought their love. Their approbation would have made me fearless and fearful in their defence and for their rights— their injustice makes me their enemy. My passions, O 2 unprovoked and unexaggerated by mortifying repulses, would have only been a warm and stimulating influence, perpetually working in their service—but, pressed upon and irritated as they have been, they grew into so many wild beasts, and preyed upon the cruel or the careless keepers, whose gentle treatment and constant attention had tamed them into obedient servants. Yet, would I could, even now, return to that condition in which there might have been hope. The true spectre of the criminal—such as I am—the criminal chiefly from the crimes and injustice of society, not forgetting the education of my boyhood, which grew out of the same crimes, and whose most dreadful lesson is selfishness—is despair! The black waters once past, the hills rise between, and there is no return to those regions of hope, which, once lost, are lost for ever. This is the true punishment —the worst punishment which man inflicts upon his fellow—the felony of public opinion. The curse of society is no unfit illustration of that ban which its faith holds forth as the penal doom of the future. There is no return!” The dialogue, mixed up thus, throughout, with the utterance of opinions on the part of the outlaw, many of which were true, or founded in truth, yet coupled with many false deductions—was devoted, for some little while longer, to the discussion of their various necessities and plans for the future. The night had considerably progressed in this way, when, of a sudden, their ears were assailed with an eldritch screech, like that of the owl, issuing from one of the several cells around them. The quick sense of Rivers immediately discerned the voice of the idiot, and without hesitation he proceeded to that division of the rock which contained the two prisoners. To each of these apartments had been assigned a sentinel, or watch, whose own place of abode, while covered completely and from sight, and in all respects furnishing a dwelling, though rather a confined one, for himself, enabled him to attend to the duty assigned him without himself being seen. The night had been fairly set in, when Bunce, with the aid of Chub Williams, with all due caution proceeded to his task, and with so much success, that, in the course of a couple of hours, they had succeeded, not only in making a fair outlet for themselves, but for Lucy Munro too. The watchman, in the mean time, holding his station as merely nominal, gave himself as little trouble as possible; and believing all things quiet, had, after a little while, insinuated himself into the good graces of as attractive a slumber as may usually be won in the warm summer season in the south, by one to whom a night-watch is a peculiarly ungracious exercise. Before this conclusion, however, he looked forth every now and then, and deceived by the natural stillness of earth and sky, he committed the further care of the hours, somewhat in anticipation of the time, to the successor who was to relieve him on the watch. Without being conscious of this decision in their favour, and ignorant entirely of the sentinel himself, the pedler fortunately chose this period for his own departure with the young lady whom he was to escort; and who, with probably far less fear than her gallant, did not scruple, for a single instant, to go forth under his guidance. Chub took his instructions from the lips of Lucy, and promised the most implicit obedience. They had scarcely been well gone when the sentinels were changed, and one something more tenacious of discipline, or something less drowsy than his predecessor, took his place. After muttering at intervals, as directed, for the space of an hour, probably, from the time at which his companion had departed, Chub thought it only prudent to sally forth too. Accordingly, ascending to the break in the wall, through which his companion had made his way, the urchin emerged from the cavern at the unlucky moment, when, at some ten or fifteen paces in front of him, the sentinel came forth from his niche to inspect the order of his watch. Chub saw his adversary first, and his first impulse originated the scream which at once drew the attention of Rivers, as already narrated. The outlaw rushed quickly to the scene of difficulty, and before the sentinel had well recovered from the astonishment occasioned by the singularly sudden appearance and wild screech of the urchin. “Why, what is this, Briggs; what see you?” was the hasty inquiry of Rivers. “There, sir, there,” exclaimed the watch, still half bewildered, and pointing to the edge of the hill, where, in a condition seemingly of equal incertitude with himself, stood the imbecile. “Seize upon him—take him at once—let him not escape you!” were the hasty orders of the outlaw. Briggs set forward, but his approach had the effect of giving determination also to Chub; who, just as the pursuer thought himself sure of his captive, and was indeed directly upon him, doubled himself up, as it were into a complete ball, and without effort rolled headlong down the hill; gathering upon his feet as he attained the level, seemingly unhurt, and with all the agility of the monkey. “Shall I shoot, sir?” was the inquiry of Briggs, as the urchin stood off, laughing wildly at his good fortune. “Now, don't”—was the cry—“Now, don't”— was the exclamation of Chub himself, who, however, trusting nothing to the effect of his entreaty, ran vigorously on his way. “Yes, shoot him down,” was the sudden exclamation of Munro; but Rivers struck the poised weapon upward in the hands of the sentinel, to the astonishment, not less of the sentinel than of the landlord. “No—let him live, Munro. Let him live. Such as he should be spared. Is he not alone—without fellowship—scorned—an outcast—without sympathy—like myself. Let him live, let him live!” and as he concluded a direction, so strange from his lips, his countenance indicated the most foreign abstraction of his thoughts. Munro gave directions to see after the other prisoners. A few moments sufficed for this, and the panic was universal among the inmates of the rock. The secret was now lost, unless immediate pursuit could avail in the recovery of the fugitives. This pursuit was immediately undertaken, and both Rivers and Munro, taking different directions, and dispersing their whole force about the forest, set off on the search. Apprehensive of pursuit, the policy of Bunce, to whom Lucy gave up the entire direction of their flight, was determined upon with not a little judgment. Assured that his pursuers would search chiefly on the direct route between their abode and the village, to which they would necessarily surmise the flight was directed, he boldly determined upon a course, picked sinuously out, obliquing largely from the true direction, which, while it would materially lengthen the distance, would at least secure them, he thought, from the danger of contact with the scouring party. By no means ignorant of the country, in and about which he had frequently travelled in the pursuit of trade, he contrived, fortunately, in this way, completely to mislead the pursuers; and the morning found them still some distance from the village, but in a direction affording few chances of interruption in their contemplated approach to it. Lucy was dreadfully fatigued, and a frequent sense of weariness almost persuaded her to lay down life itself in utter exhaustion; but the encouraging words of the pedler, and the thought of his peril, for whose safety, though herself hopeless of all beside, she would willingly peril all, restored her, and invigorated to renewed effort. At the dawn of day they approached a small farm-house, some of the inmates of which happened to know Lucy, and, though they looked somewhat askant at her companion, and wondered not a little at the circumstance of her travelling at such a time of night, yet, as she was generally well respected, their surmises and scruples were permitted to sleep; and, after a little difficulty, they were persuaded to lend her the family pony and side-saddle, with the view to the completion of her journey. Taking some slight refreshment, she hurried on; Bunce, taking the road on foot, alongside, with all the patient docility of a squire of the middle ages; and to the great satisfaction of all parties, they arrived in sight of the village, just as Counsellor Pippin, learned in the law, was disputing with the state attorney upon the non-admissibility of certain points of testimony, which it was the policy of the former to exclude.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “Read out the doom,—the written doom of guilt, He spills man's blood, by man his blood be spilt— Let no delay impede the law's decree, Bind the chord surely, and prepare the tree.” The village of Chestatee was crowded with visiters of all descriptions. Judges and lawyers, soldiers and citizens and farmers—all classes were duly represented, and a more wholesome and subordinate disposition in that quarter, may be inferred as duly resulting from the combination. Curiosity brought many to the spot from portions of country twenty, thirty, and even forty miles off—for, usually well-provided with good horses, the southron finds a difference of ten or twenty miles no great matter. Such had been the reputation of the region here spoken of, not less for its large mineral wealth than for the ferocious character of those in its neighbourhood, that numbers, who would not otherwise have adventured, now gladly took advantage of the great excitement, and presence of so many, to look themselves upon a section of which they had heard so long and so much. There came the planter, of rather more wealth than his neighbours, solicitous for some excitement and novelty to keep himself from utter stagnation. There came the farmer, discontented with his present abiding-place, and in search of a new spot of more promise, in which to drive stakes and do better. The lawyer, from a neighbouring county, in search of a cause; and the creditor in search of his runaway debtor—the judge and the jury also added something, not less to the number than the respectability of the throng. The grand jury had found a number of bills, and most of them for the more aggravated offences in the estimation of the law. Rivers, Munro, Blundell, Forrester, were all severally and collectively included in their inquiries; but as none of the parties were to be found, for the present at least, and as one of them had been removed to another and higher jurisdiction, the case of most importance left remaining was that which charged Colleton with Forrester's murder. There was no occasion for delay; and, in gloomy and half desponding mood, though still erect and unshrinking to the eye of the beholder, Ralph refused the privilege of a traverse, and instructed Pippin to go on with the case. The lawyer himself had not the slightest objection to this procedure, for, not to be harsh in our estimate of his humanities, there is no reason to believe that he regarded for a single instant the value of his client's life, but as its preservation was to confer credit upon his capacity as his legal friend and adviser. The issue was consequently made up without delay—the indictment was read, and the prisoner put himself upon God and the country, according to the usual forms, and the case proceeded. The general impression of the spectators was decidedly in favour of the accused. His youth— the noble bearing—the ease, the unobtrusive confidence—the gentle expression, pliant and, though sad, yet entirely free from any thing like desponding weakness—all told in his favour. He was a fine specimen of the southern aristocrat—the true nobleman of that region, whose pride of character is never seen, and is only to be felt in the influence which it invariably exercises over all with whom it may have contact or connexion. Though firm in every expression, and manly in every movement, there was nothing in the habit and appearance of Ralph, which, to the eye of those around, savoured of the murderer. There was nothing ruffianly or insincere. But, as the testimony proceeded—when the degree of intimacy was shown which had existed between himself and the murdered man—when they heard that Forrester had brought him wounded and fainting to his home— had attended him—had offered even to fight for him with Rivers.—When all these facts were developed, in connexion with the sudden flight of the person so befriended—on the same night with him who had befriended him—he having a knowledge of the proposed departure of the latter, and with the finding of the bloody dagger marked with the youth's initials—this feeling very perceptibly underwent a change. The people, proverbially fickle, veered round to the opposite extreme of opinion, and a confused buzz around, sometimes made sufficiently audible to all senses, indicated the unfavourable character of the change. The witnesses were closely examined, and the story was complete and admirably coherent. The presumptions, as they were coupled together, were conclusive; and, when it was found that not a solitary witness came forward even to say that the accused was a man of character and good connexions—a circumstance which could not materially have affected the testimony as it stood, but which, wanting, gave it additional force—the unhappy youth, himself, felt that all was over. A burning flush, succeeded by a deathlike paleness, came over his face for a moment;—construed by those around into a consciousness of guilt—for, where the prejudices of men become active, all appearances of change which go Vol. II.—P not to affect the very foundation of the bias, are only additional proofs of what they have before believed. He rested his head upon his united hands in deep but momentary agony. What were his feelings then? With warm, pure emotions—with a pride, only limited by a true sense of propriety—with an ambition, whose eye was sunward ever—with affections which rendered life doubly desirable, and which made love a high and holy aspiration—with these several and predominating feelings struggling in his soul, to be told of such a doom—to be stricken from the respect of his fellows—to forfeit life, and love, and reputation—to undergo the punishment of the malefactor, and to live in memory only as a felon—ungrateful, foolish, fiendish—a creature of dishonest passions, and mad and merciless in their exercise. The tide of thought, which bore to his consciousness all these harrowing convictions, was sudden as the wing of the lightning, and nearly shattered, in that single instant, the towering manhood whose high reachings had attracted it. But the pride consequent to his education and the society in which he had lived, came to his relief; and after the first dreadful agony of soul, he again stood erect, and listened, seemingly unmoved, to the defences set up by his counsel. But how idle, even to his mind, desirous as he must have been of every species of defence, were all the vainglorious mouthings of the pettifogger. He soon discovered that the ambition of Pippin chiefly consisted in the utterance of his speech. He saw, too, in a little while, that the nonsense of the lawyer had not even the solitary merit—if such it be—of being extemporaneous; and in the slow and monotonous delivery of a long string of stale truisms, not bearing any analogy to the case in hand, he perceived the dull elaborations of the closet. But such was not the estimate of the lawyer himself. He knew what he was about; and having satisfied himself that the case was utterly hopeless, he was only solicitous that the people should see that he could still make a speech. He well knew that his auditory, perfectly assured with himself of the hopelessness of the defence, would give him the credit of having made the most of his materials, and this was all he wanted. In the course of his exhortations, however, he was unfortunate enough to make an admission for his client which was, of itself, fatal; and his argument thence became unnecessary. He admitted that the circumstances sufficiently established the charge of killing, but proceeded, however, to certain liberal assumptions, without any ground whatever of provocation on the part of Forrester, which made his murder only matter of self-defence on the side of the accused, whose crime, therefore, became justifiable; but Ralph, who had for some time been listening with manifest impatience to sundry misrepresentations, not equally evil with this, but almost equally annoying, now rose and interrupted him; and though the proceeding was something informal, proceeded to correct the statement. “No one, may it please your honour, and you, gentlemen, now presiding over my fate, can be more conscious than myself, from the nature of the evidence given in this case, of the utter hopelessness of any defence which may be offered on my behalf. But, while recognising, in their fullest force, the strong circumstantial proofs of crime which you have heard, I may be permitted to deny for myself what my counsel has been pleased to admit for me. To say that I have not been guilty of this crime, is only to repeat that which was said when I threw myself upon the justice of the country. I denied any knowledge of it then—I deny any knowledge of, or participation in it, now. I am not guilty of this killing, whether with or without justification. The blood of the unfortunate man, Forrester, is not upon my hands; and whatever may be your decree this day, of this sweet consciousness nothing can deprive me. “I consider, may it please your honour, that my counsel, having virtually abandoned my cause, I have the right to go on with it myself—” But here Pippin, who had been dreadfully impatient heretofore, started forward, with evident alarm. “Oh, no—no, your honour—my client—Mr. Colleton—how can you think such a thing? I have not, your honour, abandoned the case—on the contrary, your honour will remember, that it was while actually proceeding with the case that I was interrupted.” The youth, with a singular degree of composure, replied:— “Your honour will readily understand me, though the gentleman of the bar does not. I conceive him not only to have abandoned the case, your honour, but actually to have joined hand and hand with the prosecuting counsel. It is true, sir, that he still calls himself my counsel—and still, under that name, presumes to harangue, as he alleges, in my behalf; but, when he violates the truth, not less than my instructions—when he declares all that is alleged against me in that paper to be true—all of which I declare to be false—when he admits me to be guilty of a crime of which I am not guilty—I say that he has not only abandoned my case, but that he has betrayed the trust reposed in him. What, your honour, must the jury infer from the confession which he has just made? What!—but that in my conference with him I have made the same confession? It becomes necessary, therefore, may it please your honour, not only that I take from him, thus openly, the power which I confided to him, but that I call upon your honour to demand from him, upon oath, whether such an admission was ever made to him by me. I know that my own words will avail me nothing here—I also know why they should not—but I am surely entitled to require that he should speak out as to the truth, when his misrepresentations are to make weight against me in future. His oath, that I made no such confession to him, will avail nothing for my defence, but will avail greatly with those who, from present appearances, are likely to condemn me. I call upon him, may it please your honour, as matter of right, that he should be sworn to this particular. This, your honour will perceive, if my assertion be true, is the smallest justice which he can do me; beyond this I will ask and suggest nothing—leaving it to your own mind how far the license of his profession should be permitted to one, who thus not only abandons, but betrays and misrepresents his client.” The youth was silent, and Pippin rose to speak in his defence. Without being sworn, he admitted freely that such a confession had not been made, but that he had inferred the killing from the nature of the testimony, which he thought conclusive on the point. That his object had been to suggest a probable difficulty between the parties, in which he would have shown Forrester as the aggressor. He bungled on for some time longer in this manner, but as he digressed again into the defence of the accused, Ralph again begged to interrupt him. “I think it important, may it please your honour, that the gentleman should be sworn as to the simple P 2 fact which he has uttered. I want it on record, that, at some future day, the few who have any interest in my fate should feel no mortifying doubts of my innocence, when reminded of the occurrence—which this strange admission, improperly circulated, might otherwise occasion. Let him swear, your honour, to the fact; this, I think, I may require.” After a few moments of deliberation, his honour decided that the demand was one of right, strictly due, not merely to the prisoner, and to the abstract merits of the circumstance, but also to the necessity which such an event clearly created, of establishing certain governing principles for restraining those holding situations so responsible, who should so far wilfully betray their trusts. The lawyer was made to go through the humiliating process, and then subjected to a sharp reprimand from the judge; who, indeed, might have well gone further, in actually striking his name from the rolls of court. It was just after this interesting period in the history of the trial, and when Pippin, who could not be made to give up the case, as Ralph had required, was endeavouring to combat with the attorney of the State some incidental points of doctrine, and to resist their application to certain parts of the previously recorded testimony, that our heroine, Lucy Munro, attended by her trusty squire, Bunce, made her appearance in the court-house. She entered the hall more dead than alive. The fire was no longer in her eye—a thick haze had overspread its usually rich and lustrous expression —her form trembled with the emotion—the strong and struggling emotion of her soul—and fatigue had done much towards the general enervation of her person. The cheek was pale with the innate consciousness—the lips were blanched, and slightly parted, as if wanting in the muscular exercise which could bring them together. She tottered forward to the stand upon which the witnesses were usually assembled, and to which her course had been directed, and for a few moments after her appearance in the court-room, her progress had been as one stunned by a sudden and severe blow. But, when roused by the confused hum of human voices around her, she ventured to look up, and her eye, as if by instinct, turned upon the dark box assigned for the accused—she again saw the form, in her mind and eye, of almost faultless mould and excellence, —and then there was no more weakness—no more struggle. Her eye kindled—the colour rushed into her cheeks—a sudden spirit re-invigorated her frame—and with clasped hands she boldly ascended the small steps which led to the stand from which her evidence was to be given, and declared her ability, in low tones, almost unheard but by the judge, to furnish matter of interest and importance to the defence. Some little demur as to the formality of such a proceeding, after the evidence had been fairly closed, took place between the counsel; but, fortunately for justice, the judge was too wise and too good a man to limit the course of truth to prescribed rules, which could not be affected by a departure, in the present instance, from their restraints. The objection was overruled, and the bold, but yet trembling girl, was called upon for her testimony. A new hope had been breathed into the bosoms of the parties most concerned, on the appearance of this interruption to the headlong and impelling force of the circumstances so fatally arrayed against the prisoner. The pedler was overjoyed, and concluded that the danger was now safely over. The youth himself felt his spirit much lighter in his bosom, although he himself knew not the extent of that testimony in his favour which Lucy was enabled to give. He only knew that she could account for his sudden flight on the night of the murder, leading to a fair presumption that he had not premeditated such an act; and knew not that it was in her power to overthrow the only feature in the circumstances shown against him, by which they had been so connected as to make out his supposed guilt. Sanguine herself that this power was in her to effect the safety of the accused, Lucy had not for a moment considered the effect upon others, more nearly connected with her than the youth, of the development. These considerations were yet to come. The oath was administered,—she began her narration, but, at the very outset, the difficulties of her situation beset her. How was she to save the man she loved? How—but by showing the guilt of her uncle? How was she to prove that the dirk of the youth was not in his possession at the time of the murder? By showing that just before that time it was in the possession of Munro, who was setting forth for the express purpose of murdering the man, now accused and held guilty of the crime. The fearful gathering of thoughts and images, thus without preparation working in her mind, again destroyed the equilibrium by which her truer senses would have enforced her determination to proceed. Her head swam—her words were confused and incoherent, and perpetually contradictory. The hope which her presence had inspired as suddenly departed; and pity and doubt were the prevailing sentiments of the spectators. After several ineffectual efforts to proceed, she all at once seemed informed of the opinions around her, and gathering new courage from the dreadful thought now forcing itself upon her mind, that what she had said had done nothing towards her object—she exclaimed impetuously, advancing to the judge, and speaking alternately from him to the jury and the counsel,— “He is not guilty of this crime, believe me. I may not say what I know—I cannot—you would not expect me to reveal it. It would involve others whom I dare not name. I must not say that— but believe me, Mr. Colleton is not guilty—he did not commit the murder—it was somebody else —I know, I will swear he had no hand in the matter.” “Very well, my good girl—I have no doubt you think, and honestly believe all that you say; but what reasons have you for this bold assertion in the teeth of all the testimony which has already been given? You must not be surprised if we are slow in believing what you tell us, until you can show upon what grounds you stand forth in his behalf. Do not be terrified—speak freely—officer! a chair for the lady—tell us all that you know— keep nothing back—remember, you are sworn to speak the truth—the whole truth.” The judge spoke kindly and encouragingly, while, with considerable emphasis, he insisted upon a full statement of all she knew. But the distress of the poor girl increased with every moment of thought, which warned of the predicament in which such a statement must necessarily involve her uncle. “Oh, how can I speak all this? How can I tell that which must destroy him—” “Of whom do you speak, lady. Who is he?” inquired the attorney of the state. “He—who?—Oh, no, I can say nothing, I can tell you nothing. I know nothing but that Mr. Colleton is not guilty. He struck no blow at Forrester. I am sure of it—some other hand—some other person. How can you believe that he would do so?” There was no such charitable thought for him, however, in the mind of those who heard—as how should there be? A whispering dialogue now took place between the judge and the counsel, in which, while they evidently looked upon her as little better than demented with her love for the accused, they still appeared to hold it due to justice, not less than to humanity, to obtain from her every particular of testimony bearing on the case, which, by possibility, she might really have in her possession. Not that they really believed that she knew any thing which might avail the prisoner. Regarding her as individually and warmly interested in his life, they looked upon her appearance, and the evidence which she tendered—if so it might be styled—as solely intended to provoke sympathy, gain time, or possibly, as the result of feelings so deeply excited as to have utterly passed the bounds of all restraining reason. The judge himself, who was a good, not less than a sensible man, undertook, in concluding this conference, to pursue the examination himself, with the view to the bringing out such portions of her information as delicacy or some other more influential motive might persuade her to conceal. “You are sure, Miss Munro, of the innocence of the prisoner—so sure that you are willing to swear to it. Such is your conviction, at least; for, unless you saw the blow given by another hand, or could prove Mr. Colleton to have been elsewhere at the time of the murder, of course you could not, of a certainty, swear to any such fact. You are not now to say whether you believe him capable of such an act or not. You are to say whether you know of any circumstances which shall acquit him of the charge, or furnish a plausible reason, why others, not less than yourself, should have a like reason with yourself to believe so. Can you do this, Miss Munro? Can you show any thing in this chain of circumstances against him which, of your own knowledge, you can say to be untrue? Speak out, young lady, and rely upon every indulgence from the court.” Here the judge recapitulated all the evidence which had been furnished against the prisoner. The maiden listened with close attention, and the difficulties of her situation became more and more obvious. Finding her slow to answer, though her looks were certainly full of meaning, the presiding officer took another course for the object which he had in view. He now proceeded to her examination in the following form. “You know the prisoner?” “I do.” “You knew the murdered man?” “Perfectly.” “Were they frequently together since the appearance of the prisoner in these regions?” “Frequently.” “At the house in which you dwell?” “Yes.” “Were they together on the day preceding the night of the murder?” “They were—throughout the better portion of it.” “Did they separate at your place of residence, and what was the employment of the prisoner subsequently on the same day?” “They did separate while at our house, Mr. Colleton retiring at an early hour of the evening to his chamber.” “So far, Miss Munro, your answers correspond directly with the evidence, and now come the important portions. You will answer briefly and distinctly. After that, did you see any thing more of the prisoner, and know you of his departure from the house—the hour of the night—the occasion of his going—and the circumstances attending it?” These questions were indeed all important to the female delicacy of the maiden, and as her eye sunk in confusion, and as her cheek paled and kindled with the innate consciousness, the youth, who had hitherto been silent, now rose, and without the slightest pause or hesitancy of manner, requested of the maiden that she would say no more. “See you not, your honour, that her mind wavers—that she speaks and thinks wildly. I am satisfied that though she might say something, your honour, in accounting for my strange flight, yet, as that constitutes but a small feature in the circumstances against me, what she can allege will avail me little. Press her no farther, therefore, I entreat you. Let her retire. Her word can do me no good, and I would not that, for my sake and life, she should feel, for a single instant, an embarrassment of spirit, which, though it be honourable in its character, must necessarily be distressing in its exercise. Proceed with your judgment, I pray you—whatever it may be—I am now ready for the worst, and though innocent as the babe unborn of the crime urged against me, I am not afraid to meet its consequences. I am not unwilling to die.” “But you must not die—they will not—they cannot find you guilty! How know they you are guilty? Who dares say you are guilty, when I know you are innocent. Did I not see you fly? Did I not send you on your way—was it not to escape from murder yourself that you flew, and how should you have been guilty of that crime of which you were the destined victim yourself. Oh, no— no! you are not guilty—and the dagger—I heard that!—that is not true—Oh no, the dagger—you dropt it—” The eye of the inspired girl was caught by a glance—a single glance—from one at the opposite corner of the court-room, and that glance brought her back to the full consciousness of the fearful development she was about to make. A decrepit old woman, resting with bent form upon a staff which was planted firmly before her, seemed wrapt in the general interest pervading the court. The woman was huge of frame and rough of make; her face was large and swollen, and the tattered cap and bonnet, the soiled and coarse materials which she wore, indicated one of the humblest caste in the country. Her appearance attracted no attention, and she was unmarked by all around; few having eyes for any thing but the exciting business under consideration. But the disguise did not conceal her uncle from the glance of his niece. That one look had the desired effect—the speech was arrested before its conclusion, and the spectators, now more than ever assured of the very partial sanity of the witness, gave up any doubts which had previously manifested themselves in behalf of the accused. A second look of the landlord was emphatic enough for the purpose of completely silencing her farther evidence. She read in its fearful expression, as plainly as if spoken in words —“The next syllable you utter is fatal to your uncle —your father. Now speak, woman, if you can.” Vol. II.—Q For a single moment she was dumb and stationary—her eye turned from her uncle to the prisoner. Horror, and the agonies natural to the strife in her bosom, were in its wild expression, and, with a single cry of “I cannot—I must not save him,” from her pallid lips, she sunk down senseless upon the hard floor, and was borne out by several of the more sympathizing spectators. There was nothing now to delay the action of the court. The counsel had closed with the argument, and the judge proceeded in his charge to the jury. His remarks were rather favourable than otherwise to the prisoner. He dwelt upon his youth—his manliness—the seeming excellence of his education, and the propriety which had marked his whole behaviour on trial. These he spoke of as considerations which must, of course, make the duty which they had to perform more severely painful to all. Still, he could not do away with the strong and tenacious combination of circumstances against him. They were closely knit, and all tended strongly to the conviction of the guilt of the accused. Still they were circumstantial; and the doubts of the jury were, of course, so many arguments on the side of mercy. He concluded. But the jury had no doubts. How should they doubt? They deliberated, indeed, for form sake, but not long. In a little while they returned to their place, and the verdict was read by the clerk. “Guilty.” “Guilty,” responded the prisoner, and for a moment his head dropped upon the clasped hands, and his frame shivered as with an ague. “Guilty —guilty—Oh, my father—Edith—Edith—have I lived for this?” There was no other sign of human weakness. He arose with composure, and followed, with firm step, the officer to his dungeon. His only thought was of the sorrows and the shame of others—of those of whom he had been the passion, and the pride—of that father's memory and name, of whom he had been the cherished hope —of that maiden of whom he had been the cherished love. His firm, manly bearing won the esteem of all those who, nevertheless, at the same moment, had few if any doubts of the justice of his doom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. “I have a prayer to thee, that my fond soul Still evermore is uttering to herself, So that my lips have learn'd it, and for aye Do syllable it into sound.” Ralph Colleton was once more in his dungeon —alone—and without hope. For a moment during the progress of his trial, and at the appearance of Lucy, he deemed it possible that some providential fortune might work a change in the aspect of things, favourable to his escape from what, to his mind, was far worse than any thought of death, in the manner of his death. But when, after a moment of reflection, he perceived that the feminine delicacy of the maiden must suffer from any further testimony from her lips—when he saw that, most probably, in the minds of all who heard her narration, the circumstance of her appearance in his chamber and at such an hour of the night, and for any object, would be fatal to her reputation—when he perceived this consciousness, too, weighing down even to agony the soul of the still courageous witness—the high sense of honour which had always prompted him, not less than the chivalrous consideration of the sex taught in the south among the earliest lessons of society to its youth—compelled him to interpose, and prevent, if possible, all further utterance, which, though possibly all-important to him, would be fatally destructive to her. He did so. He succeeded, and he was in his dungeon—hope shut out from its walls, and a fearful death and ignominy written upon them. When the officers attending him had retired—when he heard the bolt shot, and saw that the eyes of curiosity were excluded—the firm spirit fled which had supported him. A passing weakness of heart grew uppermost, and he sunk down upon the single chair allotted to his prison. He buried his face in his hands, and the warm tears gushed freely through his fingers. But he heard approaching footsteps, and speedily recovered. The traces of his weakness were sedulously brushed from his cheeks, and the handkerchief employed for the purpose studiously put out of sight. He was not ashamed of the pang, but he was not willing that other eyes should behold it. Such was the nature of his pride—the pride of strength, moral strength, and superiority over those weaknesses, which, however natural they may be, are nevertheless not often becoming in the man. It was the pedler, Bunce, who made his appearance—choosing, with a feature of higher characteristic than would usually have been allotted him, rather to cheer the prison hours of the unfortunate, than to pursue his own individual advantages; which, at such a time, might not have been inconsiderable. The worthy pedler was dreadfully disappointed in the result of his late adventure. He had not given himself any trouble to inquire into the nature of those proofs which Lucy Munro had assured him were in her possesion; but satisfied as much by his own hope as by her assurance, that all would be as he wished it, he had been elevated to a pitch of almost indecorous joy, which strongly contrasted with his present depression. He had little now to say in the way of consolation, and that little was coupled with so much that was unjust to the maiden, as to call forth, at length, the rebuke of Colleton. “Forbear on this subject, my good sir—she did what she could, and what she might have said would not have served me much. It was well she said no more. Her willingness—her adventuring so much in my behalf—should alone be sufficient to protect her from every thing like blame. But tell me, Bunce, what has become of her—where is she gone, and who is now attending her?” “Why, they took her back to the old tavern. A great big woman took her there, and looked after her. I did go and had a sight on her, and there, to be sure, was Munro's wife, though her I did see, I'll be sworn, in among the rocks, where they shut us up.” “And was Munro there?” “Where—in the rocks?” “No—in the tavern? You say his wife had come back—did he trust himself there?” “I rather guess not—seeing as how he'd stand a close chance of 'quaintance with the rope. No, neither him, nor Rivers, nor any of the regulators —thank the powers—ain't to be seen nowhere. They're all off—up into the nation, I guess, or off, down in Alabam by this time, clear enough.” “And who did you see at the rocks, and what men were they that made you prisoners?” Q 2 “Men—if I said men, I was 'nation out, I guess. Did I say men?” “I understood you so.” “'Twan't men at all. Nothing better than women, and no small women neither. Didn't see a man in the neighbourhood, but Chub, and he ain't no man neither.” “What is he?” “Why, for that matter, he's neither one thing nor another—nothing, no how. What they call a hobbe-de-hoy will suit for his name sooner than any other that I know on. For he ain't a man and he ain't a boy; but jest a short, half-grown up chunk of a fellow, with bunchy shoulders, and a big head, with a mouth like an oven, and long lap ears like saddle flaps.” In this manner the pedler informed Ralph of all those previous particulars with which he had not till then been acquainted. This having been done, and the dialogue having fairly reached its termination—the words of the two having now but occasional utterance, and the youth exhibiting some strong symptoms of weariness—Bunce took his departure for the present, not, however, without again proffering his services. These Ralph did not scruple to accept—giving him, at the same time, sundry little commissions, and among them, a message of thanks and respectful consideration to Miss Munro. She, in the meanwhile, had, upon fainting in the court-room, been borne off in a state of utter insensibility to the former residence of Munro, to which place, as the pedler has already informed us, the wife of the landlord had that very morning returned, resuming, precisely as before, all the previous order of her domestic arrangements. The reason for this return may be readily assigned. The escape of the pedler and of Lucy from their place of temporary confinement had completely upset all the prior arrangements of the outlaws. They now conceived it no longer safe as a retreat; and failing as they did to overtake the fugitives, it was determined that in the disguises which had been originally suggested for their adoption, they should now venture into the village, as many of them as were willing, to obtain that degree of information which would enable them to judge what further plans to adopt. As Rivers had conjectured, Chub Williams, so far from taking for the village, had plunged deeper into the woods, flying to former and well known haunts, and regarding the face of man as that of a natural enemy. The pedler had seen none but women, or those so disguised as such as to seem none other than what their guise indicated--while Lucy had been permitted to see none but her uncle and aunt, and one or two persons she had never seen before. Under these circumstances, Rivers individually felt no apprehensions that his wild refuge would be searched; but Munro, something older, less sanguine, and somewhat more timid than his colleague, determined no longer to risk it; but having, as we have seen, effectually checked the utterance of that evidence which, in her unconscious excitation, must have involved him more deeply in the meshes of the law, besides indicating his immediate and near neighbourhood, he made his way, unobserved, from the village, having first provided for her safety, and, as he had determined to keep out of the way himself, having brought his family back to their old place of abode. He had determined on this course from a variety of considerations. Nothing, he well knew, could affect his family. He had always studiously kept them from any participation in his offences. The laws had no terror for them, and untroubled by any process against him, they could still remain and peaceably possess his property, of which he well knew, in the existing state of society in the south, no legal outlawry of himself would ever avail to deprive them. This could not have been his hope in their common flight. Such a measure, too, would only have impeded his progress, in the event of his pursuit, and have burdened him with incumbrances which would perpetually have involved him in difficulty. He calculated differently his chances. His hope was to be able, when the first excitements had overblown, to return to the village, and, at least, quietly to effect such a disposition of his property, which was not inconsiderable, as to avoid the heavy and almost entire loss which would necessarily follow any other determination. In all this, however, it may be remarked that the reasonings of Rivers, rather than his own, determined his conduct. That more adventurous ruffian had, from his superior boldness and greater capacities in general, acquired a singular and large influence over his companion: he governed him, too, as much by his desire of gain, as by any distinct superiority which he himself possessed: he stimulated his avarice with the future results of their enterprises in the same region after the passing events were over; and thus held him still in that fearful bondage of subordinate villany, whose inevitable tendency is to become the creature, and finally the victim. The gripe which, in a moral sense and with a slight reference to character, Rivers had upon the landlord, was as tenacious as that of death—but with this difference, that it was death prolonged, through a fearful, and though not a protracted, yet much too long a life. The determination of Munro was made accordingly; and, following hard upon the flight of Lucy from the rocks, we find the landlady quietly reinstated in her old home as if nothing had happened. Munro did not, however, return to the place of refuge; he had no such confidence in circumstances as Rivers; his fears had grown active in due proportion with his increase of years; and, with the increased familiarity with crime, had grown up in his mind a corresponding doubt of all persons, and an active suspicion which trusted nothing; his abode in all this time was uncertain; he now slept at one deserted lodge, and now at another—now in the disguise of one and now of another character; now on horse-back, now on foot—but in no two situations taking the same feature or disguise. In the night-time, he sometimes adventured, though with great caution, to the village, and made inquiries. On all hands, he heard of nothing but the preparations making against the clan of which he was certainly one of the prominent heads. The state was going on with activity, and a proclamation of the governor, offering a high reward for the discovery and detention of any persons having a hand in the murder of the Guard, was on one occasion put into his hands. All these things made caution necessary, and, though venturing still very considerably at times, he was yet seldom entirely off his guard. Rivers kept close in the cover of his den. That den had numberless ramifications, however, known only to himself; and his calm indifference was the result of a conviction that it would require two hundred men, properly instructed, and all at the same moment, to trace him through its many sinuosities. He too, sometimes, carefully disguised, adventured into the village, but never much in the sight of those who were not bound to him by a common danger. To Lucy he did not appear on such occasions, though he did to the old lady, and even at the family fireside. Lucy, indeed, had eyes for few objects, and thoughts but for one. She sat as one stupified with danger—yet sufficiently conscious of it as to be conscious of nothing beside. She was bewildered with the throng of horrible circumstances which had been so crowded on her mind and memory in so brief a space of time. At one moment she blamed her own weakness in suffering the trial of Ralph to progress to a consummation which she shuddered to reflect upon. Had she a right to withhold her testimony—testimony so important to the life and the honour of one, whose life and honour were no less dear to her heart than they could possibly be to his? Had she performed her duty in suffering his case to go to judgment? and such a judgment—so horrible a doom! Should she now suffer it to go to its dreadful execution, when a word from her would stay the hand of the officer, and save the life of the condemned. But would such be its effect? What credence would be given now to one, who, in the hall of justice, had sunk down like a criminal herself—withholding the truth, and contradicting it at every word of her utterance? To whom then could she apply —who could hear her plea—even though she boldly narrated all the truth—in behalf of the prisoner? She maddened as she thought on all these difficulties—her blood grew fevered—a thick haze overspread her senses, and she raved at last in the most wild delirium. Some days went by in her unconsciousness, and when she at length grew calm—when the fever of her mind had somewhat subsided,—she opened her eyes and found, to her great surprise, her uncle sitting beside her couch. It was midnight; and this was the hour he had usually chosen when making his visits to his family. In these stolen moments, his attendance was chiefly given to that hapless orphan, whose present sufferings he well knew were in great part attributable to himself. The thought smote him, for, in reference to her, all feeling had not departed from his soul. There was still a lurking sensibility—a lingering weakness of humanity—one of those pledges which nature gives of her old affiliation, and which she never entirely takes away from the human heart. There are still some strings, feeble and wanting in energy though they be, which bind even the most reckless outcast in some little particular to humanity; and, however time, and the world's variety of circumstance may have worn them and impaired their firm hold, they still sometimes, at unlooked-for hours, regrapple the long rebellious subject, and make themselves felt and understood as in the first moments of their creation. Such now was their resumed sway with Munro. While his niece--the young, the beautiful, the virtuous—so endowed by nature—so improved by education—so full of those fine graces, beyond the reach of any art, lay before him insensible--her fine mind spent in incoherent ravings; her gentle form racked with convulsive shudderings—the still small monitorial voice, unheard so long, spoke out to him in terrible rebukings. He felt in those moments how deeply he had been a criminal; how much, not of his own, he had appropriated to himself and sacrificed—and how sacred a trust he had abused, in the person of the delicate creature before him, by a determination the most cruel and perhaps unnecessary. Days had elapsed in her delirium; and such were his newly awakened feelings, that each night brought him, though at considerable risk, an attendant by her bed. His hand administered—his eyes watched over; and in the new duties of the parent, he acquired a feeling of domesticity, the pleasures of which he had never felt before. But she grew conscious at last—and her restoration relieved his mind of one apprehension which had sorely troubled it. Her condition, during her illness, was freely described to her. But she thought not of herself—she had no thought for any other than the one for whom thoughts and prayers promised now to avail but little. “Uncle—” she spoke at last—“you are here, and I rejoice to see you. I have much to say— much to beg at your hands—Oh, let me not beg in vain. Let me not find you stubborn to that which may—not make me happy—I say not that, for happy I never look to be again—but to make me as much so as human power can make me. When—” and she spoke hurriedly, while a strong and aguish shiver went through her whole frame—“when is it said that he must die?” He knew perfectly of whom she spoke, but felt reluctant to indulge her mind in a reference to a subject which had already exercised so large an influence over it. But he knew little of the distempered heart, and fell into an error by no means uncommon with society. She soon convinced him of this, when his prolonged silence left it doubtful whether he contemplated an answer. “Why are you silent—do you fear to speak? Have no fears now. We have no time for fear. We must be active—ready—bold. Feel my hand—it trembles no longer. I am no longer a weak-hearted woman.” He again doubted her sanity, and spoke to her soothingly, seeking to divert her mind to indifferent subjects; but she smiled on the endeavour, which she readily understood, and putting aside her aunt, who pressed forward with a like object, she again addressed her uncle. “Doubt me not, uncle—I rave no longer. I am now calm—calm as it is possible for me to be, having such a sorrow as mine struggling at my heart. Why should I hide it from you? It will not be hidden. I love him—love him as woman never loved man before—with a soul and spirit, all and unreservedly his, and with no thought in which he is not always the principle. I know that he loves another—I know that the passion which I feel I must feel and cherish alone; that it must burn itself away, though it burns away its dwelling-place. I am resigned to such a fate; but I am not prepared for more. I cannot bear that he too should die— and such a death. He must not die--he must not die, my uncle; though we save him--ay, save him --for another.” “Shame on you, my daughter—how can you confess so much. Think on your sex—your youth—” was the somewhat strongly worded rebuke of the old lady. “I have thought on all—on every thing. I feel all that you have said, and the thought and the feeling have been my madness. I must speak, or I shall again go mad. I am not the tame and cold creature that the world calls woman. I have been differently made. I can love in the world's despite. I can feel through the world's freeze—I can dare all, when my soul is in it, though the world sneer in scorn and contempt. But what I have said, is said to you. I would not—no—not for worlds, that he should know I said it—not for worlds!”—and her cheeks were tinged slightly, Vol. II.—R while her head rested slightly and for a single instant upon the pillow. “But all this is nothing,” she started up, and again addressed herself to the landlord. “Speak, uncle, tell me, is there yet time--yet time to save him--when is it that they say he must die?” “On Friday next, at noon.” “And this—?” “Is Monday.” “He must not die—no,—not die, then, my uncle. You must save him—you must save him. You have been the cause of his doom—you must preserve him from its execution. You owe it him as a debt--you owe it me--you owe it to yourself. Believe not, my uncle, that there is no other day than this—no other world—no other penalties than belong to this. You read no Bible, but you have a thought which must tell you that there are worlds —there is a life yet to come. I know you cannot doubt--you must not doubt--you must believe. Have a fear of its punishments—have a hope of its rewards—and listen to my prayer. You must save Ralph Colleton—ask me not how—talk not of difficulties. You must save him—you must— you must.” “Why, you forget, Lucy—my dear child—you forget that I too am in danger. This is midnight --it is only at this hour that I can steal into the village—and how, and in what manner shall I be able to do as you require?” “Oh, man!--man!—forgive me, dear uncle, I would not vex you. But if there were gold in that dungeon—broad bars of gold, or shining silver, or a prize that would make you rich, would you ask me the how and the where? Would that clumsy block, and those slight bars, and that dull jailer be an obstacle that would keep you back? Would you need a poor girl like me to tell you that the blocks might be pierced—that the bars might be broken—that the jailer might be won to the mercy which would save. You have strength—you have skill—you have the capacity, the power—there is but one thing wanting to my prayer—the will, the disposition.” “You do me wrong, Lucy—great wrong, believe me. I feel for this young man, and the thought has been no less painful to me than to you, that my agency has contributed in great measure to his danger. But what if I were to have the will, as you say—what if I went forward to the jailer and offered a bribe--would not the bribe which the State has offered for my arrest be a greater attraction than any in my gift? To scale the walls and break the bars, or in any forcible manner to effect the purpose, I must have confederates, and in whom could I venture to confide? The few to whom I could entrust such a design are, like myself, afraid to adventure or be seen, and such a design would be defeated by Rivers himself, who so much hates the youth, and is bent on his destruction.” “Speak not of him—say to him nothing—you must do it yourself, if you do it at all. You can effect much if you seriously determine. You can design and execute all, and find ready and able assistance, if you once willingly set about it. I am not able to advise, nor will you need my counsel. Assure me that you will make the effort —that you will put your whole heart into it, and I have no fears--I feel confident of his escape.” “You think too highly of my ability in this respect. There was a time, Lucy, when such a design had not been so desperate, but now—” “Oh, not so desperate now, uncle, uncle—I could not live--not a moment—were he to perish in that dreadful manner. Have I no claim upon your mercy—will you not do for me what you would do for the attainment of money—what you have done, at the bidding of that dreadful wretch, Rivers? Nay, look not away, I know it all—I know that you had the dagger of Colleton—that you put it into the hands of the wretch who struck the man—that you saw him strike—that you strove not to stop his hand. Fear you not I shall reveal it? Fear you not?—but I will not—I cannot. But this should be enough to make you strive in this service. Heard you not, too, when he spoke, knowing that my word would have saved him— rather than see me brought to the dreadful trial of telling what I knew of that night—that awful night, when you both sought his life? Oh, I could love him for this—for this one thing—were there nothing else beside worthy of my love.” The incident to which she referred had not been unregarded by the individual she addressed, and while she spoke his looks assumed a meditative expression, and he spoke as in soliloquy, and in broken sentences:— “Could I pass to the jail unperceived—gain admittance—then--but who would grapple with the jailer--how manage that?—let me see—but no— no—that is impossible!” “What is impossible?--no—nothing is impossible in this, if you will but try. Do not hesitate, dear uncle—it will look easier if you will but for a while reflect upon it. You will see many ways of bringing it about. You can get aid if you want it. There's the pedler, who is quite willing, and Chub—Chub will do much if you can only find him out.” The landlord smiled as she named these two accessaries. “Bunce—why what could the fellow do?—he's not the man for such service—now Chub might be of value, if he'd only follow orders: but that he won't do. I don't see how we're to work it, Lucy—it looks more difficult the more I think on it.” “Oh, if it's only difficult—if it's not impossible—it will be done. Do not shrink back, uncle, do not scruple. The youth has done you no wrong— you have done him much. You have brought him where he is—he would have been safe otherwise. You must save him. Save him, uncle—and hear me as I promise. You may then do with me as you please. From that moment I am your slave, and then, if it must be so—if you will then require it, I am willing then to become his slave too— him whom you have served so faithfully and so unhappily for so long a season.” “Of whom speak you?” “Guy Rivers! yes—I shall then obey you, though the funeral come with the bridal.” “Lucy!” “It is true. I hope not to survive it. It will be a worse destiny to me than even the felon death to the youth, whom I would save. Do with me as you please then—but let him not perish. Rescue him from the doom you have brought upon him—and oh, my uncle, in that other world—if there we meet —the one good deed shall atone, in the thought of my poor father, for the other most dreadful sacrifice to which his daughter now resigns herself.” The stern man was touched. He trembled, and his lips quivered convulsively as he took her hand into his own. Recovering himself, in a firm tone, not less solemn than that which she had preserved throughout the dialogue, he replied,— “Hear me, Lucy, and believe what I assure you. I will try to save this youth. I will do R 2 what I can, my poor child, to redeem the trust of your father. I have been no father to you heretofore—not much of one, at least—but it is not too late, and I will atone. I will do my best for Colleton—the thing is full of difficulty and danger, but I will try to save him. All this, however, must be unknown—not a word to anybody; and Rivers must not see you happy, or he will suspect. Better not be seen—still keep to your chamber, and rest assured that all will be done, in my power, for the rescue of the youth.” “Oh, now you are, indeed, my father—yet— uncle, shall I see you at the time when it is to be done? Tell me at what moment you seek his deliverance, that I may be upon my knees. Yet say not to him that I have done any thing or said any thing which has led to your endeavours. He will not think so well of me if you do—and, though he may not love, I would have him think always of me as if—as if I were a woman.” She was overcome with exertion, and the revived hope had, by its struggles, still further exhausted her. She sank back in slumbers far more sweet than those for some time preceding, when Munro and his wife retired from the apartment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “What, will you save him? Marry, then, I will, And here's my hand on it.” A day more had elapsed, and the bustle in the little village was increased by the arrival of other travellers. A new light came to the dungeon of Ralph Colleton, in the persons of his uncle and sweet cousin, whom his letters, at his first arrest, had apprized of his situation. They knew that situation only in part, however; and the first intimation of his doom was that which he himself gave them. The meeting was full of a painful pleasure. The youth himself was firm—muscle and mind all over; but deeply did his uncle reproach himself for his precipitation and sternness, and the grief of Edith, like all deep grief, was dumb, and had no expression. There was but the sign of wo—of wo inexpressible in the ashy lip, the glazed, the tearless and half wandering eye, and the convulsive shiver, that at intervals racked her whole frame, like strong and sudden gusts down among the foliage. The youth, if he had any at such an hour, spared his reproaches. He narrated in plain and unexaggerated language, as if engaged in the merest narration of commonplace, all the circumstances of his trial. He pointed out the difficulties, to his mind insuperable, and strove to prepare the minds of those who heard, for the final and saddest trial of all, as his own mind had prepared him. In that fearful work of preparation, the spirit of love could have no restraining influence, and never was embrace more fond than that of Ralph and the maiden. Much of his uncle's consolation was found in the better disposition which he now entertained, though at too late a day, in favour of their passion. He would now willingly consent to all. “Had you not been so precipitate, Ralph—” he said—“had you not been so proud—had you thought at all, or given me time for thought, all this trial had been spared us. Was I not irritated by other things when I spoke to you unkindly? You knew not how much I had been chafed—you should not have been so hasty.” “No more of this, uncle, I pray you. I was wrong and rash, and I blame you not. I have nobody but myself to reproach. Speak not of the matter; but, as the best preparation for all that is to come, let your thought banish me rather from contemplation. Why should the memory of so fair a creature as this be haunted by a story such as mine. Why should she behold, in her mind's eye, for ever, the picture of my dying agonies—the accursed scaffold—the—” and the emotion of his soul, at the subject of his own contemplation, choked him in his utterance, while Edith, half-fainting in his arms, prayed his forbearance. “Speak not thus—not of this, Ralph, if you would not have me perish. I am fearfully sick now—my head swims, and all is commotion at my heart. Not water—not water—give me words of hope—of consolation. Tell me that there is still some chance—some little prospect. That somebody is gone in search of evidence—in search of hope. Is there not a circumstance which may avail? Said you not something of—did you not tell me of a person who could say for you that which would have done much towards your escape? A woman, was it not—speak, who is she—let me go to her—she will not refuse to tell me all, if she be a woman.” Ralph assured her in the gentlest manner of the hopelessness of any such application; and the momentary dream which her own energies had conjured into a promise, as suddenly subsided, leaving her to a full consciousness of her desolation. Her father at length found it necessary to abridge the interview. Every moment of its protraction seemed still more to unsettle the understanding of his daughter. She spoke wildly and confusedly, and in that thought of separation which his doom perpetually forced upon her, she contemplated in all its fearful extremities, her own. She was borne away but half alive—the feeling of wo something blunted, however, by the mental unconsciousness following its realization. Private apartments were readily found them in the village, and having provided good attendance for his daughter, Col. Colleton set out, though almost entirely hopeless, to ascertain still farther the particulars of the case, and to see what might be done in behalf of one of whose innocence he felt perfectly assured. He knew Ralph too well to suspect him of falsehood; and the clear narrative which he had given —and the manly and unhesitating account of all particulars having any bearing on the case which had fallen from his lips, he knew, from all his previous highmindedness of character, might safely be relied on—assured of this himself, he deemed it not improbable that something might undergo development, in a course of active inquiry, which might tend to the creation of a like conviction in the minds of those in whom rested the control of life and judgment. His first visit was to the lawyer, from whom, however, he could procure nothing, besides being compelled, without possibility of escape, to listen to a long string of reproaches against his nephew. “I could, and would have saved him, Col. Colleton, if the power were in mortal,” was the self-sufficient speech of the little man; “but he would not—he broke in upon me when the very threshold was to be passed, and just as I was upon it. Things were in a fair train, and all might have gone well but for his boyish interruption. I would have come over the jury with a settler. I would have made out a case, sir, for their consideration, which every man of them would have believed he himself saw. I would have shown your nephew, sir, riding down the narrow trace, like a peaceable gentleman—anon, sir, you should have seen Forrester coming along full tilt after him. Forrester should have cried out with a whoop and a right royal oath—then Mr. Colleton would have heard him, and turned round to receive him. But Forrester was drunk, you know, and would not understand the young man's civilities. He blunders out a volley of curses right and left, and bullies Master Colleton for a fight, which he declines. But Forrester is too drunk to mind all that—without more ado, he mounts the young gentleman, and is about to pluck out his eyes, when he feels the dirk in his ribs, and then they cut loose. He gets the dirk from Master Colleton and makes at him—but he picks up a hatchet that happens to be lying about, and drives at his head, and down drops Forrester, as he ought to, dead as a door nail.” “Good Heavens! and why did you not bring these facts forward. They surely could not have condemned him under these circumstances.” “Bring them forward! To be sure I would have done so, but, as I tell you, just when on the threshold, at the very entrance into the transaction, up pops this hasty young fellow—I'm sorry to call your nephew so, Col. Colleton—but the fact is, he owes his situation entirely to himself. I would have saved him, but he was obstinately bent on not being saved; and just as I commenced the affair, up he pops and tells me, before all the people, that I know nothing about it. A pretty joke, indeed. I know nothing about it—and it my business to know all about it. Sir, it ruined him —I saw, from that moment, how the cat would jump. I pitied the poor fellow, but what more could I do?” “But it is not too late—we can memorialize the governor, we can put these facts in form, and by duly showing them with the accompanying proofs, we can obtain a new trial—a respite.” “Can't be done now—it's too late. Had I been let alone—had not the youth come between me and my duty, I would have saved him, sir, as, under God, I have saved hundreds before. But it's too late now.” “Oh, surely not too late—with the facts that you mention, if you will give me the names of the witnesses furnishing them, so that I can obtain their affidavits—” “Witnesses!—what witnesses?” “Why, did you not tell me of the manner in which Forrester assaulted my nephew, and forced upon him what he did as matter of self defence. Where is the proof of this?” “Oh, proof. Why, you did not think that was the true state of the case—that was only the case I was to present to the jury.” “And there is then no evidence for what you have said?” “Not a tittle, sir. Evidence is scarcely necessary in a case like this, sir, where the State proves more than you can possibly disprove. Your only hope, sir, is to present a plausible conjecture to the jury. Just set their fancies to work, and they have a taste most perfectly dramatic. What you leave undone, they will do. Where you exhibit a blank, they will supply the words wanting. Only set them on trail, and they'll tree the 'possum. They are noble hands at it, and, as I now live and talk to you, sir, not one of them who heard the plausible story which I would have made out, but would have discovered more common sense and reason in it than in all the evidence you could possibly have given them. Because, you see, I'd have given them a reason for every thing. Look, how I should have made out the story. Mr. Colleton and Forrester are excellent friends, and both agree to travel together. Well, they're to meet at the forks by midnight. In the mean time, Forrester goes to see his sweetheart, Kate Walton—a smart girl, by-the-way, colonel, and well to look on. Parting's a very uncomfortable thing, now, and they don't altogether like it. Kate cries, and Forrester storms. Well, must come, comes at last. They kiss and are off—different ways. Well, Grief's but a dry companion, and, to get rid of him, Forrester takes a drink— still Grief holds on, and then he takes another and another, until Grief gets off at last, but not before taking with him full half, and not the worst half either, of the poor fellow's senses. What then? Why then he swaggers and swears at every thing, and particularly at your nephew, who, you see, not knowing his condition, swears at him for keeping him waiting—” “Ralph Colleton never swears, Mr. Pippin,” said the colonel, grimly. “Well—well, if he didn't swear then, he might very well have sworn, and I'll be sworn but he did on that occasion; and it was very pardonable too. Well, he swears at the drunken man, not knowing his condition, and the drunken man rolls and reels like a rowdy, and gives it to him back, and then they get at it. Your nephew, who is a stout colt, buffets him well for a time, but Forrester, who is a mighty powerful built fellow, he gets the better in the long run, and both come down together in the road. Then Forrester, being uppermost, sticks his thumb into Master Colleton's eye—the left eye, I think it was—yes, the left eye it was—and the next moment it would have been out, when your nephew, not liking it, whipped out his dirk, and, 'fore Forrester could say Jack Robinson, it was playing about in his ribs; and then comes the hatchet part, just as I told it you before.” “And is none of this truth?” “God bless your soul, no. Do you suppose, if it was the truth, it would have taken so long a time in telling. I wouldn't have wasted the breath in telling it. The witnesses would have done that, if it were true; but in this was the beauty of my art, and had I been permitted to say to the jury what I've said to you, the young man would have been clear. It wouldn't have been gospel, but where's the merit of a lawyer if he can't go through a bog. This is one of the sweetest and most delightful features of the profession. Sir, it is putting the wings of fiction to the lifeless and otherwise immoveable body of the fact.” Colonel Colleton was absolutely stunned by the fertility and volubility of the speaker, and after listening for some time longer, as long as it was possible to procure from him any thing which might be of service, he took his departure, bending his way next to the wigwam, in which, for the Vol. II.—S time being, the pedler had taken up his abode. It will not be necessary that we should go with him there, as it is not probable that any thing materially serving his purpose or ours will be adduced from the narrative of Bunce. In the mean time, we will turn our attention to a personage, whose progress must correspond in all respects with that of our narrative. Guy Rivers had not been unapprized of the presence of the late comers at the village. He had his agents at work, who marked the progress of things, and conveyed their intelligence to him with no qualified fidelity. The arrival of Colonel Colleton and his daughter had been made known to him within a few hours after its occurrence, and the feelings of the outlaw were of a nature the most complex and contradictory. Secure within his den, the intricacies of which were scarcely known to any but himself, he did not study to restrain those emotions which had prompted him to so much unjustifiable outrage. With no eye to mark his actions or to note his speech, the guardian watchfulness which had secreted so much, in his association with others, was taken off, and we see much of that heart and those wild principles of its government, the mysteries of which were painful to behold. Slowly, and for a long time after the receipt of the above mentioned intelligence, he strode up and down the narrow cell of his retreat; all passions at sway and contending for the mastery—sudden action and incoherent utterance occasionally diversifying the otherwise monotonous movements of his form. At one moment, he would clench his hands with violence together, while an angry malediction would escape through his knitted teeth—at another, a demoniac smile of triumph, and a fierce laugh of gratified malignity would ring through the apartment, coming back upon him in an echo, which would again restore him to consciousness, and bring back the silence so momentarily banished. “They are here—they have come to witness his degradation—to grace my triumph—to feel it, and understand my revenge. We will see if the proud beauty knows me now—if she yet continues to discard and to disdain me. I have her now upon my own terms—she will not refuse—I am sure of her—I shall conquer her proud heart—I will lead her in chains—the heaviest chains of all—the chains of a dreadful necessity. He must die else. I will howl it in her ears with the voice of the wolf —I will paint it before her eyes with a finger dipt in blood and in darkness. She shall see him carried to the gallows—I shall make her note the halter about his neck—that neck, which, in her young thought, her arms were to have encircled only—nor shall she shut her eyes upon the last scene—nor close her ears to the last groan of my victim. She shall see and hear all, or comply with all that I demand. It must be done—but how? How shall I see her—how obtain her presence—how command her attention. Pshaw! shall a few beardless soldiers keep me back, and baffle me in this? Shall I dread the shadow now, and shrink back when the sun shines out that makes it? I will not fear. I will see her—I will bid defiance to them all. She shall know my power, and upon one condition only will I use it to save him. She will not dare to refuse the condition—she will consent—she will at last be mine—and for this I will do so much—go so far—ay, save him whom I would yet be so delighted to destroy.” Night came, and in a small apartment of one of the lowliest dwellings of Chestatee, Edith and her father sat in the deepest melancholy, conjuring up perpetually, in their minds, those images of sorrow so necessarily the concomitants of their present situation. It was somewhat late, and they had just returned from an evening visit to the dungeon of Ralph Colleton. The mind of the youth was in far better condition than theirs, and his chief employ had been in preparing them for a similar feeling of resignation with himself. He had succeeded but indifferently. They strove to appear firm, that he should not be less so than they found him; but the effort was very perceptible, and the recoil of their dammed-up emotions was only so much more fearful and overpowering. The strength of Edith had been severely tried, and her head now rested upon the bosom of her father, whose arms were required for her support, in a state of feebleness and exhaustion, leaving it doubtful, at moments, whether the vital principle had not itself utterly departed. At this period the door opened, and a stranger stood abruptly before them. His manner was sufficiently imposing, though his dress was that of the wandering countryman— savouring of the jockey, and not much unlike that frequently worn by such wayfarers as the stage-driver and carrier of the mails. He had on an overcoat, made of buckskin—an article of the Indian habit—a deep fringe of the same material hung suspended from two heavy capes that depended from the shoulder. His pantaloons were formed of the same material—a fox-skin cap rested slightly upon his head, rather more upon one side than the other; while a whip of huge dimensions occupied one of his hands. Whiskers, of a bushy form and most luxuriant growth, half-obscured his cheek, and the moustaches were sufficiently small to lead to the inference that the wearer had only recently determined upon the benefit of their association. A black silk handkerchief, wrapped loosely about his neck, completed the general outline; and the tout ensemble indicated one of those dashing blades, so frequently to be encountered in the southern country, who, despising the humdrum monotony of regular life, are ready for adventure —lads of the turf—the muster-ground—the general affray—the men who can whip their weight in wild-cats—whose general rule it is to knock down and drag out. Though startling at first to both father and daughter, the manner of the intruder was such as to forbid any further alarm than was incidental to his first abrupt appearance. His conduct was respectful and distant—closely observant in the proprieties of his address, and so studiously guarded, as to satisfy them, at the very outset, that nothing improper was intended. Still, his entrance without any intimation was sufficiently objectionable to occasion a hasty demand from Colonel Colleton, as to the meaning of his intrusion. “None, sir, is intended, which may not be atoned for,” was the reply. “I had reason to believe, Colonel Colleton, that the present melancholy circumstances of your family were such as might operate to the excuse of an intrusion, which may have the effect of making them less so—which, indeed, may go far towards the prevention of that painful event which you now contemplate as certain.” The words were electrical in their effect upon both father and daughter. The former rose from his chair, and motioned the stranger to be seated, while the daughter, rapidly rising, with an emotion which gave new life to her form, inquired, breathlessly— “Speak, sir, say—how!”—and she lingered and listened with figure bent sensibly forward, and S 2 hand uplifted and motionless, for reply. The person addressed smiled with visible effort, while slight shades of gloom, like the thin clouds fleeting over the sky at noonday, obscured at intervals the otherwise subdued and even expression of his countenance. He looked at the maiden while speaking, but his words were addressed to her father. “I need not tell you, sir, that the hopes of your nephew are gone—there is no single chance upon which he can rest a doubt whereby his safety may be secured. The doom is pronounced—the day is assigned—and the executioner is ready.” “Is your purpose insult, sir, that you tell us this?” was the rather fierce inquiry of the colonel. “Calmly, sir,”—was the response, in a manner corresponding well with the nature of his words— “my purpose, I have already said, is to bring, or at least to offer, relief—to indicate a course which may eventuate in the safety of the young man whose life is now at hazard; and to contribute myself to the object which I propose.” “Go on—go on, sir, if you please—but spare all unnecessary reference to his situation,” said the colonel, as a significant pressure of his arm by his daughter motioned him to patience. The stranger proceeded:— “My object in dwelling upon the youth's situation was, if possible, by showing its utter hopelessness in every other respect, to induce you the more willingly to hear what I had to offer, and to comply with certain conditions which must be preparatory to any development upon my part.” “There is something strangely mysterious in this. I am willing to do any thing and every thing, in reason and without dishonour, for the safety of my nephew—the more particularly as I believe him altogether innocent of the crime laid to his charge. More than this I dare not; and I shall not be willing to yield to unknown conditions, prescribed by a stranger, whatever be the object; but speak out at once, sir, and keep us no longer in suspense. In the mean time, retire, Edith, my child—we shall best transact this business in your absence. You will feel too acutely the consideration of this subject to listen to it in discussion. Go, my daughter.” But the stranger interposed, with a manner not to be questioned:— “Let her remain, Colonel Colleton—it is, indeed, only to her that I can reveal the mode and the conditions of the assistance which I am to offer. This was the preliminary condition of which I spoke. To her alone can my secret be revealed— and my conference must be entirely with her.” “But, sir—this is so strange—so unusual—so improper.” “True, Colonel Colleton—in the ordinary concerns, the every-day offices of society, it would be strange, unusual, and improper; but these are not times, and this is not a region of the world, in which the common forms are to be insisted upon. You forget, sir, that you are in the wild abiding-place of men scarcely less wild—with natures as stubborn as the rocks, and with manners as uncouth and rugged as the woodland growth which surrounds us. I know as well as yourself, that my demand is unusual, but such is my situation—such, indeed, the necessities of the whole case, that there is no alternative. I am persuaded that your nephew can be saved—I am willing to make an effort for that purpose, and my conditions are to be complied with—one of them you have heard—it is for your daughter to hear the rest.” The colonel still hesitated. He was very tenacious of those forms of society, and of intercourse between the sexes, which are rigidly insisted upon in the south, and his reluctance was manifest— while he yet hesitated, the stranger again spoke. “The condition which I have proposed, sir, is unavoidable, but I ask you not to remove from hearing—the adjoining room is not so remote, but that you can hear any application which your daughter may be pleased to make. My own security depends, not less than that of your nephew, upon your compliance, if I undertake to save him.” These suggestions prevailed. Suspecting the stranger to be one whose evidence would point to the true criminal, himself an offender, he at length assented to the arrangement, and after a few minutes further dialogue he left the room. As he retired, the stranger carefully locked the door, a movement which somewhat alarmed the maiden, but the respectful manner with which he approached her, and her own curiosity, not less than interest in the progress of the event, kept her from the exhibition of any apprehensions. The stranger now approached her. His glances, though still respectful, were long and searching upon her face. He seemed to study all its features, comparing them, as it would seem, with his own memories upon the subject. At length, as with a sense of maidenly propriety she turned sternly away, he addressed her— “Miss Colleton has forgotten me, it appears, though I have some claim to be an old acquaintance. I, at least, have a better memory for my friends—I have not forgotten her.” Edith looked upon him in astonishment, but there was no recognition in her glance. A feeling of mortified pride might have been detected in the expression of his countenance, as with a tone of calm unconsciousness, she replied— “You are certainly unremembered, if ever known, by me, sir. I am truly sorry to have forgotten one who styles himself my friend.” “Who was—who is—or rather, who is now willing again to be your friend, Miss Colleton”—was the immediate reply. “Yes, and so I will gladly call you, sir, if you succeed in what you have promised.” “I have yet promised nothing, Miss Colleton.” “True, true! but you say you have the power, and surely would not withhold it in such a time. Oh, speak, sir—tell me how you can serve us all— and receive my blessings and my thanks for ever.” “The reward is great—very great—but not greater—perhaps not as great, as I may demand for my services. But we should not be ignorant of one another in such an affair—at such a time as this. Is it true, then, that Miss Colleton has no memory which, at this moment, may spare me from the utterance of a name, which perhaps she herself would not be altogether willing to hear, and which it is not my policy to have uttered by any lips, and far less by my own. Think—remember—lady, and let me be silent still on that one subject. Let no feeling of pride influence the rejection of a remembrance which perhaps carries with it but few pleasant reflections.” Again were the maiden's eyes fixed searchingly upon the speaker, and again, conflicting with the searching character of his own glance, were they withdrawn, under the direction of a high sense of modest dignity. She had made the effort at recognition—that was evident—even to him, and had made it in vain. “Entirely forgotten—well! better that than to have been remembered as the thing I was. Would it were possible to be equally forgotten by the rest —but this too is in vain and childish. She must be taught to remember me.” Thus muttered the stranger to himself; assuming, however, an increased decision of manner at the conclusion, he approached her, and tearing from his cheeks the huge whiskers that had half-obscured them, he spoke in hurried accents:— “Look on me now, Miss Colleton—look on me now, and while you gaze upon features once sufficiently well known to your glance, let your memory but retrace the few years when it was your fortune, and my fate, to spend a few months in Gwinnett county. Do you remember the time— do you remember that bold, ambitious man, who at that time was the claimant for a public honour —who was distinguished by you in a dance, at the ball given on that occasion—who, maddened by wine, and a fierce passion which preyed upon him then, like a consuming fire, addressed you, though a mere child, and sought you for his bride, who—but I see you remember all!” “And are you then Creighton—Mr. Edward Creighton—and so changed?” And she looked upon him with an expression of simple wonder. “Ay, that was the name once—but I have another now. Would you know me better—I am Guy Rivers, where the name of Creighton must not again be spoken. It is the name of a felon— of one under doom of outlawry, whom all men are privileged to slay. I have been hunted from society—I can no longer herd with my fellows—I am without kindred, and am almost without kind. Yet, base and black with crime—doomed by mankind—banished all human abodes—the slave of fierce passions—the leagued with foul associates, I dared, in your girlhood, to love you; and, more daring still, I dare to love you now. Fear not, lady—you are Edith Colleton to me; and worthless, and vile, and reckless though I have become, for you I can hold no thought which would behold you other than you are—a creature for worship rather than for love. As such I would have you still; and for this purpose do I seek you now. I know your feeling for this young man—I saw it then, when you repulsed me. I saw that you loved each other, though neither of you were conscious of the truth. You love him now—you would not have him perish—I know well how you regard him, and I come, knowing this, to make hard conditions with you for his life.” “Keep me no longer in suspense—speak out, Mr. Creighton”—she cried, gaspingly. “Rivers—Rivers—I would not hear the other —it was by that name I was driven from my fellows.” “Mr. Rivers—say what can be done—what am I to do—money—thanks, all that we can give shall be yours, so that you save him from this fate.” “And who would speak thus for me? What fair pleader, fearless of man's opinion—that blights or blesses, without reference to right or merit— would so far speak for me!” “Many—many, Mr. Rivers,—I hope there are many. Heaven knows, though I may have slighted, in my younger days, your attentions, I know not many for whom I would more willingly plead and pray than yourself. I do remember now your talents and high reputation, and deeply do I regret the unhappy fortune which has denied them their fulfilment.” “Ah, Edith Colleton—these words would have saved me once—now they are nothing, in recompense for the hopes which are for ever gone. Your thoughts are gentle, and may sooth all spirits but my own. But sounds that lull others, lull me no longer. It is not the music of a rich dream, or of a pleasant fancy, which may beguile me into pleasure. I am dead—dead as the cold rock—to their influence. The storm which blighted me had seared, and ate into the very core. I am like the tree through which the worm has travelled—it still stands, and there is foliage upon it, but the heart is eaten out and gone. Your words touch me no longer as they did—I need something more than words and mere flatteries—flatteries so sweet even as those which come from your lips—are no longer powerful to bind me to your service. I can save the youth—I will save him, though I hate him; but the conditions are fatal to your love for him.” “I can listen—I can hear all that you may say having reference to him. You have said truly my feelings on the subject; and, sir, your own passion, if without offence I may refer to it now, will truly account for my anxiety to do him service. I know not what you may intend; I know not what you may demand for your service. All in honour—all that a maiden may grant and be true to herself, all—all, for his life and safety.” “Still, I fear me, Miss Colleton—your love for him is not sufficiently lavish to enable your liberality to keep pace with the extravagance of my demand—” “Hold, sir—on this particular there is no need of further speech. Whatever may be the extent of my regard for Ralph, it is enough that I am willing to do much, to sacrifice—to give much—in return for his rescue from this dreadful fate. Speak, therefore, your demand—spare no word—delay me, I pray, no longer.” “Hear me then: As Creighton, I loved you years ago—as Guy Rivers I love you still. The life of Ralph Colleton is forfeit—for ever forfeit— and a few days only interpose between him and eternity. I alone can save him—I can give him freedom; and, in doing so, I shall risk much, and sacrifice not a little. I am ready for this risk—I am prepared for every sacrifice—I will save him at all hazards from his doom, upon one condition!” “Speak! speak!” “That you be mine—that you fly with me—that in the wild regions of the west, where I will build you a cottage, and worship you as my own forest divinity, you take up your abode with me, and be my wife. My wife—all forms shall be complied with, and every ceremony which society may call for. Nay, shrink not back thus—” seeing her recoil in horror not less than reproach at his suggestion—“beware how you defy me—think, that I have his life in my hands—think, that I can speak his doom or his safety—think, before you reply!” “There is no time necessary for thought, sir— none—none. It cannot be. I cannot comply with the conditions which you propose. I would die first.” “And he will die too—Be not hasty, Miss Colleton—remember—it is not merely your death but his—his death upon the gallows—” “Spare me! spare me!” “The halter—the crowd—the distorted limb— the racked frame—” “Horrible—horrible!” “Would you see this—know this, and reflect upon the shame, the mental agony, far greater than all, of such a death to him?” With a strong effort, she recovered her composure, though but an instant before almost convulsed— Vol. II.—T “Have you no other terms, Mr. Rivers?” “None—none. Accept them, and he lives—I will free him, as I promise. Refuse them—deny me, and he must die, and nothing may save him then.” “Then he must die—we must both die—before we choose such terms. Sir, let me call my father. Our conference must end here. You have chosen a cruel office, but I can bear your infliction. You have tantalized a weak heart with hope, only to make it despair the more. But I am now strong, sir—stronger than ever—and we speak no more on this subject.” “Yet pause—to relent even to-morrow may be too late. To-night you must determine or never.” “I have already determined—I cannot change in this.” “There is one, lady—one young form—scarcely less beautiful than yourself, who would make the same—ay, and a far greater—sacrifice than this, for the safety of Ralph Colleton. One far less happy in his love than you, who would willingly die for him this hour. Would you be less ready than her for such a sacrifice?” “No, not less ready for death—as I live—not less willing to free him with the loss of my own life. But not ready for a sacrifice like this—not ready for this.” “You have doomed him!” “Be it so, sir. Be it so. Let me now call my father.” “Yet think, ere it be too late—once gone, not even your words shall call me back.” “Believe me, I shall not desire it.” The firmness of the maiden was finely contrasted with the disappointment of the outlaw. He was not less mortified with his own defeat than with the calm and immoveable bearing, the sweet, even dignity, which the discussion of a subject so trying to her heart, and the overthrow of all hope which her own decision must have occasioned, had failed utterly to affect. He would have renewed his suggestions, but while repeating them, a sudden commotion in the village—the trampling of feet— the buzz of many voices, and sounds of wide-spread confusion, contributed to abridge an interview already quite too long. The outlaw rushed out of the apartment, barely recognising, at his departure, the presence of Colonel Colleton, whom his daughter had now called in. The cause of the uproar we reserve for another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. “Will you stand by me, nobly as a man, And strike if there be need, nor wince and turn, Undoing what we aim at? Scruple not— There's gold to win you, if so be you lack A better thought to serve us.” The pledge which Munro had given to his niece in behalf of Colleton was productive of no small inconvenience to the former personage. Though himself unwilling, we must do him the justice to believe, that the youth should perish for a crime so completely his own, he had in him no great deal of that tenacious conscientiousness, of itself sufficiently strong to have persuaded him to such a risk, as that he had undertaken at the supplication of Lucy. The more he reflected upon the matter, the more trifling seemed the consideration. Money, now—the spoil or the steed of the traveller—would have been a far more decided stimulant to action. In regarding such an object, he certainly would have overlooked much of the danger, and have been less regardful of the consequences. The selfishness of the motive would not merely have sanctioned, but have smoothed the enterprise; and he thought too much with the majority—allowing for any lurking ambition in his mind—not to perceive that where there is gain, there must be glory. None of these consolatory thoughts came to him in the contemplation of his present purpose. To adventure his own life—perhaps to exchange places with the condemned he proposed to save— though, in such a risk, he only sought to rescue the innocent from the doom justly due to himself— was a flight of generous impulse somewhat above the usual aim of the landlord;—and, but for the impelling influence of his niece—an influence which, in spite of his own evil habits, swayed him beyond his consciousness—we should not now have to record the almost redeeming instance in the events of his life at this period—the one virtue, contrasting with, if it could not lessen or relieve, the long tissue of his offences. There were some few other influences, however —if this were not enough—coupled with that of his niece's entreaty, which gave strength and decision to his present determination. Munro was not insensible to the force of superior character, and a large feeling of veneration led him, from the first, to observe the lofty spirit and high sense of honour which distinguished the bearing and deportment of Ralph Colleton. He could not but admire the native superiority which characterized the manner of the youth, particularly when brought into contrast with that of Guy Rivers, for whom the same feeling had induced a like, though not a parallel respect, on the part of the landlord. It may appear strange to those accustomed only to a passing and superficial estimate of the thousand inconsistencies which make up that contradictory creation, the human mind, that such should be a feature in the character of a ruffian like Munro; but, to those who examine for themselves, we shall utter nothing novel when we assert, that a respect for superiority of mental and even mere moral attribute, enters largely into the habit of the ruffian generally. The murderer is not unfrequently found to possess benevolence as well as veneration in a high degree; and the zealots of all countries and religions are almost invariably creatures of strong and violent passions, to which the extravagance of their zeal and devotion furnishes an outlet, which is not always innocent in its direction or effects. Thus, in their enthusiasm—which is only a minor madness—whether the Eastern brahmin or the Spanish bigot, the English round-head or the follower of the “only true faith” at Mecca, be understood, it is but a word and a blow —though the word be a hurried prayer to the God of their adoration, and the blow be aimed with all the malevolence of hell at the bosom of a fellow-creature. There is no greater inconsistency in the one character than in the other. The temperament which, under false tuition, makes the zealot, and drives him on to the perpetration of wholesale murder, while uttering a prayer to the Deity, prompts the same individual who, as an assassin or a high-wayman, cuts your throat, and picks your pocket, and at the next moment bestows his ill-gotten gains without reservation upon the starving beggar by the wayside. There was yet another reason which swayed Munro not a little in his determination, if possible, T 2 to save the youth—and this was a lurking sentiment of hostility to Rivers. His pride, of late, on many occasions, had taken alarm at the frequent encroachments of his comrade upon its boundaries. The too much repeated display of that very mental superiority in his companion, which had so much fettered him, had aroused his own latent sense of independence; and the utterance of sundry pungent rebukes on the part of Rivers had done much towards provoking within him a new sentiment of dislike for that person, which gladly availed itself of the first legitimate occasion for exercise and development. The very superiority which commanded, and which he honoured, he hated for that very reason; and, in our analysis of moral dependency, we may add, that, in Greece, and the mere Hob of the humble farm-house, Munro might have been the countryman to vote Aristides into banishment because of his reputation for justice. The barrier is slight, the space short, the transition easy, from one to the other extreme of injustice; and the peasant who voted for the banishment of the just man, in another sphere and under other circumstances, would have been a Borgia or a Catiline. With this feeling in his bosom, Munro was yet unapprized of its existence. It is not with the man, so long hurried forward by his impulses as at last to become their creature, to analyze either their character or his own. Vice, though itself a monster, is yet the slave of a thousand influences, not vicious in themselves; and their desires it not uncommonly performs when blind-folded. It carries the knife, it strikes the blow, but is not always the chooser of its own victim. But, fortunately for Ralph Colleton, whatever and how many or how few were the impelling motives leading to this determination, Munro had decided upon the preservation of his life; and, with that energy of habit, which, in a rash office, or one violative of the laws, he had always heretofore displayed, he permitted no time to escape him unemployed for the contemplated purpose. His mind immediately addressed itself to its chosen duty, and, in one disguise or another, and those perpetually changing, he perambulated the village, making his arrangements for the desired object. The difficulties in his way were not trifling in character nor few in number; and the greatest of these was that of finding coadjutors willing to second him. He felt assured that he could confide in none of their well-known associates, who were to a man the creatures of Rivers; that outlaw, by a liberality which seemed to disdain money, and yielding every form of indulgence, having acquired over them an influence almost amounting to personal affection. Fortunately for his purpose, Rivers dared not venture much into the village or its neighbourhood; therefore, though free from any fear of obstruction from one in whose despite his whole design was undertaken, Munro was yet not a little at a loss for his co-operation. To whom, at that moment, could he turn, without putting himself in the power of an enemy? Thought only raised up new difficulties in his way, and in utter despair of any better alternative, though scarcely willing to trust to one of whom he thought so lightly, his eyes were compelled to rest, in the last hope, upon the person of the pedler, Bunce. Bunce, if the reader will remember, had, upon his release from prison, taken up his abode temporarily in the village. Under the protection now afforded by the presence of the judge, and the other officers of justice—not to speak of the many strangers from the adjacent parts, whom one cause or another had brought to the place—he had presumed to exhibit his person with much more audacity and a more perfect freedom from apprehension than had ever formed a part of his spirit and character before. He now—for ever on the go —thrust himself fearlessly into every cot and corner. No place escaped the searching analysis of his glance; and, in a scrutiny so nice, it was not long before he had made the acquaintance of every body and every thing at all worthy, in that region, to be known. He could now venture to jostle Pippin with impunity; for, since the trial in which he had so much blundered, the lawyer had lost no small portion of the confidence and esteem of his neighbours. Accused of the abandonment of his client—an offence particularly monstrous in the estimation of those who are sufficiently interested to acquire a personal feeling in such matters,—and compelled, as he had been—a worse feature still in the estimation of the same class—to “eat his own words”—he had lost caste prodigiously in the last few days, and his fine sayings ceased to own a flavour in the estimation of his neighbours. His speeches sunk below par along with himself; and the pedler, in his contumelious treatment of the disconsolate jurist, simply obeyed and indicated the direction of the popular opinion. One or two rude replies, and a nudge which the elbow of Bunce effected in the ribs of the lawyer, did provoke the latter so far as to repeat his threat on the subject of the prosecution for the horse, but the pedler snapped his fingers in his face as he did so, and bade him defiance. He also reminded Pippin of the certain malfeasances to which he had referred previously, and the consciousness of the truth was sufficiently strong and awkward to prevent his proceeding to any further measure of disquiet with the pedler. Thus, without fear, and with an audacity of which he was not a little proud, Bunce perambulated the village and its neighbourhood, in a mood and with a deportment he had never ventured upon before in that quarter. He had a variety of reasons for lingering in the village seemingly in a state of idleness. Bunce was a long-sighted fellow, and beheld the promise which it held forth, at a distance, of a large and thriving business in the neighbourhood, and he had too much sagacity not to be perfectly aware of the advantage, to a tradesman, resulting from a priority of ground. He had not lost every thing in the conflagration which destroyed his cart-body and calicoes; for, apart from sundry little debts due him in the surrounding country, he had carefully preserved around his body, in a black silk handkerchief, a small wallet, holding a moderate amount of the best paper—none of the issue of the small banks with a specie capital of thirty-seven and a half cents in the vaults,[1] [1] The newspapers some time ago related such an instance; doubtless somewhat exaggerated, but, it is to be feared—such is the propensity to gambling in our country,—not much wide of the mark. and a gross circulation in gorgeously printed notes of two hundred thousand dollars. No—Bunce, among other things, had soon learned to discriminate between good and bad paper, and the result of his education in this respect assured him of the perfect integrity of the three hundred and odd dollars which kept themselves snugly about his middle—ready to be expended for clocks and calicoes, horn buttons and wooden combs, knives and negro-handkerchiefs, whenever their proprietor should determine upon a proper whereabouts in which to fix himself. Bunce had grown tired of peddling—the trade was not less uncertain than fatiguing. Besides, travelling so much among the southrons, he had imbibed not a few of their prejudices against his vocation, and, to speak the truth, had grown somewhat ashamed of his present mode of life. He was becoming rapidly aristocratic, as we may infer from a very paternal and somewhat patronizing epistle, which he despatched about this time to his elder brother and co-partner, Ichabod Bunce, who carried on his portion of the business at their native place in Meriden, Connecticut. He told him, in a manner and vein not less lofty than surprising to his coadjutor, that it “would not be the thing, no how, to keep along, lock and lock with him, in the same gears.” It was henceforward his “idee to drive on his own hook. Times warn't as they used to be;” and the fact was—he did not say it in so many words—that the firm of Ichabod Bunce and Brother, was scarcely so creditable to the latter personage as he should altogether desire among his southern friends and acquaintances. He “guessed, therefore, best haul off,” and each—here Bunce showed his respect for his new friends by quoting their phraseology—“must paddle his own canoe.” We have minced this epistle, and have contented ourselves with providing a scrap, here and there, to the reader—despairing, as we utterly do, to gather from memory a full description of a performance so perfectly unique in its singular compound of lofty vein, with the patois and vulgar contractions of his native, and those common to his adopted country. It proved to his more staid and veteran brother, that Jared was the only one of his family likely to get above his bread and business; but while he lamented over the wanderings and follies of his brother, he could not help enjoying a sentiment of pride as he looked more closely into the matter. Who knows, thought the clock-maker to himself, but that Jared, who is a monstrous sly fellow, will pick up some southern heiress, with a thousand blackies—and a hundred acres of prime cotton land to each, and thus ennoble the blood of the Bunces by a rapid ascent, through the various grades of office in a sovereign state, until a seat in congress—in the administration itself—receives him:—and Ichabod grew more than ever pleased and satisfied with the idea, when he reflected that Jared had all along been held to possess a goodly person, and a very fair development of the parts of speech. Whether the individual of whom so much was expected, himself entertained any such anticipations or ideas, we do not pretend to say; but, certain it is, that the southern candidate for the popular suffrage could never have taken more pains to extend his acquaintance or to ingratiate himself among the people, than did our worthy friend the pedler. In the brief time which he had passed in the village after the arrest of Colleton, he had contrived to have something to say or do with almost everybody in it. He had found a word for his honour the judge, and having once spoken with that dignitary Bunce was not the man to fail at future recognition. No distance of manner, no cheerless response, to the modestly urged or moderate suggestion, could prompt him to forego an acquaintance. With the jurors he had contrived to enjoy a sup of whiskey at the tavern bar-room, and had actually, and with a manner the most adroit, gone deeply into the distribution of an entire packet of steel pens, one of which he accommodated to a reed, and to the fingers of each of the worthy twelve, who made the panel on that occasion—taking care, however, to assure them of the value of the gift, by saying, that if he were to sell the article, twenty-five cents each would be his lowest price, and that he could scarcely save himself at that. But this was not all. Having seriously determined upon abiding at the south, he adventured upon some few of the practices prevailing in that region, and on more than one occasion, a gallon of whiskey had circulated `free gratis,' and pro bono publico, at the cost of our worthy tradesman. These things, it may not be necessary to say, had elevated that worthy into no moderate importance among those around him; and, that he himself was not altogether unconscious of the change, it may be remarked that an ugly kink, or double in his back—the consequence of his pack and past humility—had gone down wonderfully, keeping due pace in its descent with the progress of present manifestations. Such was the somewhat novel position of Bunce, in the village and neighbourhood of Chestatee, when the absolute necessity of the case prompted Munro's application to him for assistance in the proposed extrication of Ralph Colleton. The landlord had not been insensible to the interest which the pedler had taken in the youth's fortune, and not doubting his perfect sympathy with the design in view, he felt the fewer scruples in approaching him for the purpose. Putting on, therefore, the disguise, which, as an old woman, had effectually concealed his true person from Bunce on a previous occasion, he waited until evening had set in fairly, and then proceeded to the abode of him he sought. The pedler was alone in his cottage, discussing, most probably, his future designs, and calculating to a nicety the various profits of each premeditated branch of his future business. Munro's disguise was intended rather to facilitate his progress without detection through the village, than to impose upon the pedler merely; but it was not unwise that he should be ignorant also of the person with whom he dealt. Affecting a tone of voice, therefore, which, however masculine, was yet totally unlike his own, the landlord demanded a private interview, which was readily granted, though, as the circumstance was really strange, with some few signs of trepidation. Bunce was no lover of old women, nor, indeed, of young ones either. He was habitually and constitutionally cold and impenetrable on the subject of all passions save that of trade, and would rather have sold a dress of calico than have kissed the prettiest damsel in creation. His manner, to the old woman who appeared before him, seemed that of one who had an uncomfortable suspicion of having pleased rather more than he intended; and it was no small relief, therefore, the first salutation being over, when the masculine tones reassured him. Munro, without much circumlocution, immediately proceeded to ask whether he was willing to lend a hand for the help of Colleton, and to save him from the gallows. “Colleton—save Master Colleton—do tell—is that what you mean?” “It is—are you the man to help your friend— will you make one along with others who are going to try for it.” “Well, now—don't be rash—give a body time to consider. It's so strange—” and the pedler showed himself bewildered by the sudden manner in which the subject had been broached. “There's little time to be lost, Bunce—if we don't set to work at once, we needn't set to work at all. Speak out, man! will you join us—now or never—to save the young fellow?” With something like desperation in his manner, as if he scrupled to commit himself too far, yet had Vol. II.—U the will to contribute considerably to the object, the pedler replied:— “Save the young fellow—well, I guess I will —but what's to be done—I'll lend a hand, to be sure, if there's no trouble to come of it. He's now somehow a likely chap, and not so stiff neither, though I did count him rather high-headed at first. But after that, he sort a smoothed down, and now I don't know nobody I'd sooner help jest now out of the slush; but I can't see how we're to set about it.” “Can you fight, Bunce—are you willing to knock down and drag out, when there's need for it?” “Why, if I was fairly listed, and if so be there's no law agin it. I don't like to run agin the law, no how, and if you could get a body clear on it, why—and there's no way to do the thing no other how—I guess I shouldn't stand too long to consider when it's to help a friend.” “It may be no child's play, Bunce, and there must be stout heart and free hand. One mustn't stop for trifles in such cases—and as for the law— when a man's friend's in danger he must make his own law.” “That wasn't my edication, no how—” said the pedler, as he paused to consider. The landlord saw no necessity for consideration, and fearful that the scruples of Bunce would be something too strong, he proceeded to smooth away the difficulty. “After all, Bunce, the probability is, we shall be able to manage the affair without violence; so we shall try, for I like blows just as little as anybody else—but it's best, you know, to make ready for the worst—nobody knows how things will turn up, and if it comes to the scratch, why one musn't mind knocking a fellow on the head if he stands in the way.” “No, to be sure not—twould be foolish to stop and think and be knocked down yourself—” “Certainly, you're right, Bunce; that's only reason.” “And yet, mister—I guess you wouldn't want that I should know your raal name, now, would you—or maybe you're going to tell it to me now— well—” “To the business—what matters it whether I have a name or not. I have a fist, you see, and—” “Yes, yes, I see—” exclaimed he of the notions, rapidly retreating, as Munro, suiting the action to the word, thrust rather more closely to the face of his companion than was altogether encouraging the ponderous mass which courtesy alone would consider a fist— “Well, I don't care, you see, to know the name, mister, but somehow it raally aint the thing, no how, to be mistering nobody knows who. I see you aint a woman plain enough from your face, and I pretty much conclude you must be a man— though you have got on—what's that now?—It's a kind of calico, I guess; but them's not fast colours, friend. I should say, now, you had been taken in pretty much by that bit of goods. It aint the kind of print, now, that's not afeared of washing.” “And if I have been taken in, Bunce, in these calicoes, you're the man that has done it—” said the landlord, laughing—“this piece was sold by you into my own hands, last March was a year, when you came back from the Cherokees.” “Now, don't. Well, I guess there must be some mistake—you aint sure, now, friend—might be some other dealer that you bought from?” “None other than yourself, Bunce. You are the man, and I can bring a dozen to prove it on you.” “Well, I 'spose what you say's true, and that jest lets me know how to mister you now, 'cause, you see, I do recollect now all about who I sold to that season.” The landlord had been overreached; and, amused with the ingenuity of the trader, he contented himself with again lifting the huge fist in a threatening manner, though the smile which accompanied the action fairly deprived it of its terrors. “Well—well,” said the landlord—“we burn daylight in such talk as this—I come to you as the only man who will or can help me in this matter, and Lucy Munro tells me you will—you made her some such promise.” “Well, now, I guess I must toe the chalk, after all—though, to say truth, I don't altogether remember any such promise. It must be right though, if she says it; and sartain she's a sweet body—I'll go my length for her any day.” “You'll not lose by it; and now hear my plan. You know Brooks, the jailer, and his bull-dog brother-in-law, Tongs? I saw you talking with both of them yesterday.” “Guess you're right. Late acquaintance though —they aint neither on 'em to my liking.” Enough for our purpose. Tongs is a brute who will drink as long as he can stand, and some time after it. Brooks is rather shy of it, but he will drink enough to stagger him, for he is pretty weak-headed. We have only to manage these fellows, and there's the end of it. They keep the jail.” “Yes, I know; but you don't count young Brooks?” “Oh, he's a mere boy. Don't matter about him. He's easily managed. Now hear to my design. Provide your jug of whiskey, with plenty of eggs and sugar, so that they shan't want any thing, and get them here. Send for Tongs at once, and let him once know what's in the wind, then ask Brooks, and he will be sure to force him to come. Say nothing of the boy—let him stay or come as they think proper. To ask all might make them suspicious. When here, ply them well, and then we shall go on according to circumstances. Brooks carries the keys along with him—get him once in for it, and I'll take them from him. If he resists or any of them—” “Knock 'em down?” “Ay, quick as you say it.” “Well, but how if they do not bring the boy, and they leave him in the jail?” “What then! Can't we knock him down too?” “But, then, they'll fix the whole business on my head. Won't Brooks and Tongs say where they got drunk, and then shan't I be in a scant fixin'?” “They dare not. They won't confess themselves drunk—it's as much as their place is worth. They will say nothing till they get sober, and then they'll get up some story that will fly against nobody.” “But—” “But what—will you never cease to but against obstacles? Are you a man—are you ready—bent to do what you can? Speak out, and let me know if I can depend on you—” exclaimed the landlord, impatiently. “Now, don't be in a passion—you're as soon off as a fly-machine, and a thought sooner. Why, didn't I say now, I'd go my length for the young gentleman? And I'm sure I'm ready, and aint at all U 2 afeared, no how. I only did want to say, that if the thing takes wind, as how it stood, it spiles all my calkilations. I couldn't stablish a consarn here, I guess, for a nation long spell of time after.” “And what then—where's your calculations? Get the young fellow clear, and what will his friends do for you? Think of that, Bunce. You go off to Carolina with him, and open store in his parts, and he buys from you all he wants—his negro cloths—his calicoes—his domestics, and stripes, and every thing. Then his family, and friends and neighbours, under his recommendation —they all buy from you; and then—the presents they will make you—the fine horses—and who knows but even a plantation and negroes may all come out of this one transaction?” “To be sure—who knows. Well—things do look slick enough, and there's a mighty deal of reason now in what you say. Large business that, I guess, in the long run. Aint I ready?—let's see —a gallon of whiskey—aint a gallon a heap too much for only three people?” “Better have ten than want. Then there must be pipes, tobacco, segars; and mind, when they get well on in drinking, I shall look to you through that window. Be sure and come to me then. Make some pretence, for as Brooks may be slow and cautious, I shall get something to drop into his liquor—a little mixture which I shall hand you.” “What mixture! No pizon, I hope. I don't go that—not I—no pizoning for me.” “Pshaw! fool,—nonsense!—if I wanted their lives, could I not choose a shorter method, and a weapon which I could more truly rely upon than I ever can upon you? It is to make them sleep that I shall give you the mixture.” “Oh, laudnum. Well, now, why couldn't you say laudnum at first, without frightening people so with your mixtures. There's no harm in laudnum, for my old aunt Tabitha chaws laudnum jest as other folks chaws tobacco.” “Well, that's all—it's only to get them asleep sooner. See now about your men at once. We have no time to lose, and if this contrivance fails, I must look about for another. It must be done to-night, or it cannot be done at all. In an hour I shall return; and hope, by that time, to find you busy with their brains. Ply them well—don't be slow or stingy—and see that you have enough of whiskey—here's money—have every thing ready.” The pedler took the money, and Munro left him. Bunce gave himself but little time and less trouble for reflection. The prospects of fortune which the landlord had magnified to his vision, were quite too enticing to be easily resisted by one whose morale was none of the largest; and having provided every thing, as agreed upon, necessary for their accommodation, he sallied forth for the more important purpose of getting his company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. “'Tis a joyous life we pass here in the woods, And the world wrings us not. We sing and laugh, And with the merry owl, the toper's bird, We hoot dull night away.” The task of getting the desired company was by no means difficult, and our pedler was not long in reporting progress. Tongs, a confirmed toper, was easily persuaded to any thing that guaranteed hard drinking. He luxuriated in the very idea of a debauch. Brooks, his brother-in-law, was a somewhat better and less pregnable person; but he was a widower, had been a good deal with Tongs, and, what with the accustomed loneliness of the office which he held, and the gloomy dwelling in which it required he should live, he found it not such an easy matter to resist the temptation of social enjoyment, and all the pleasant associations of that good-fellowship, which Bunce had taken care to depict before the minds of both parties. The attractions of Bunce himself, by-the-way, tended, not less than the whiskey and segars, to persuade the jailer, and to neutralize most of the existing prejudices current among those around him against his tribe. He had travelled much, and was no random observer. He had seen a great deal, as well of human nature as of places— could tell a good story, in good spirit, and was endowed with a dry, sneaking humour, that came out unawares upon his hearers, and made them laugh frequently in spite of themselves. Bunce had been now sufficiently long in the village to enable those about him to come at a knowledge of his parts; and his accomplishments in the several respects referred to, were by this time generally well understood. The inducement was sufficiently strong for the jailer; and, at length, having secured the main entrance of the jail carefully, he strapped the keys securely to a leathern girdle, which he wore about him, lodging them in the breast pocket of his coat, in a position the most safe in his thought and according to his previous experience, and prepared to go along with his worthy brother-in-law. Nor was the younger Brooks forgotten. Being a tall, good-looking lad of sixteen, Tongs insisted it was high time he should go among men; and the invitation of the pedler was chosen, as a happy occasion for his initiation into some of those practices, by a liberal courtesy esteemed significant of manliness. With every thing in proper trim, Bunce stood at the entrance ready to receive them. The preliminaries were soon despatched, and we behold them accordingly, all four, comfortably seated around a huge oaken table in the centre of the apartment. There was the jug, and there the glasses—the sugar, the peppermint, the nutmegs—the pipes and tobacco—all were convenient, and sufficiently tempting for the unscrupulous. The pedler did the honours with no little skill, and Tongs plunged headforward into the debauch. The whiskey was never better, and found, for this reason, any thing but security where it stood. Glass after glass, drank and replenished, attested the industrious hospitality of the host, not less than its own excellence. Tongs, averaging three draughts to one of his companions, was soon fairly under way in his progress to that state of mental self-glorification, in which the world ceases to have vicissitudes, and the animal realizes the abstractions of an ancient philosophy, and denies all pain to life. Brooks, however, though not averse to the overcoming element, had more of that vulgar quality of prudence than his brother, and far more than was thought amiable in the consideration of the pedler. For some time, therefore, he drank with measured scrupulousness, and it was with no small degree of anxiety that Bunce plied him with the bottle—complaining of his unsociableness, and watching, with the intensity of any other experimentalist, the progress of his scheme upon him. As for the lad—the younger Brooks—it was soon evident, that, once permitted, and even encouraged as he had been, by his superiors to drink, he would not, after a little while, give much, if any inconvenience to the conspirators. The design of the pedler was considerably advanced by Tongs, who, once intoxicated himself, was not slow in the endeavour to bring all around him under the same influence. “Drink, Brooks—drink, old fellow—” he exclaimed—“as you are a true man, drink, and don't fight shy of the critter. Whiskey, my boy—old Monongahely like this, I say—whiskey is wife and children—house and horse—lands and niggers— liberty, and (hiccup) plenty to live on. Don't you see how I drive a head, and don't care for the hind wheels? It's all owing to whiskey. Grog, I say—Hark ye, Mr. Pedler, grog, I say, is the wheels of life—it carries a man for'ad. Why don't men go for'ad in the world? What's the reason now? —I'll tell you. They're afeared. Well, now, who's afeared when he's got a broadside of whiskey in him. Nobody—nobody's afeared but you,—you, Ben Brooks, you're a d—d crick—crick,—you're always afeared of something, or nothing—for, after all, whenever you're afeared of something, it turns out to be nothing. All 'cause you don't drink like a man. That's his cha-cha-rack-ter, Mr. Bunce— and it's all owing 'cause he won't drink.” “Guess there's no sparing of reason in that bit of argument, now, I tell you, Mr. Tongs. Bless my heart—it's no use of talking, no how, but I'd a been clean done up, dead as a door nail, if it hadn't been for drink. Strong drink makes strong.— Many's the time, and the freezing cold, and the hard travelling in bad roads, and other dreadful fixins I've seed, would soon ha' settled me up, if it hadn't been for that same good stuff there, that Master Brooks does look as if he was afeared on. Now, don't be afeared, Master Brooks. There's no teeth in whiskey, and it never bites nobody.” “No,” said Brooks, with the utmost simplicity— “only when they take too much.” “How?” said the pedler, looking as if the sentence contained some mysterious meaning. Brooks might have explained, but for Tongs, who dashed in after this fashion:— “And who takes too much?—You don't mean to say I takes too much, Ben Brooks—I'd like to hear the two legged critter, now, to say I takes more of the stuff than does me good—I drinks in reason for the benefit of my health; and jest, you see, as a sort of medicine, Mr. Pedler; and, Brooks, you knows I never takes a drop more than is needful.” “Sometimes—sometimes Tongs, you know you aint all together right under it—now and then you take a little too much for your good—” was the mild response of Brooks to the almost fierce speech of his less scrupulous brother-in-law. The latter, thus encountered, changed his ground with singular rapidity. “Well, by dogs—and what of that!—and who is it says I shan't, if it's my notion. I'd like now to see the boy that'll stand up agin me and make such a speech. Who says I shan't take what I likes— and that I takes more than is good for me. Does you say so, Mr. Bunce—” “No,—thank ye, no. How should I say what aint true. You don't take half enough, now, its my idee, neither on you. It's all talk and no cider, and that I call monstrous dry work. Come, pass round the bottle. Here's to you, Master Tongs— Master Brooks, I drink your very good health. But fill up, fill up—you aint got nothing in your tumbler.” “No, he's a sneak—you're a sneak, Brooks, if you don't fill up to the hub. Go the whole hog, boy, and don't twist your mouth as if the stuff was physic. It's what I call nation good, now; no mistake in it, I tell you.” “Hah! that's a true word—there's no mistake in this stuff. It is jest now what I calls ginywine.” “True Monongahely, Master Pedler. Who ever reckoned to find a Yankee pedler with a raal good taste for Monongahely. Give us your fist, Mr. Bunce—I see you know's what's what. You aint been among us for nothing. You've larned something by travelling, and, by dogs, you'll come to something yit, if you live long enough, if so be you can only keep clear of the old range.” The pedler winced under the equivocal compliments poured forth in such profusion by his companion, but did not suffer any thing of this description to interfere with the vigorous prosecution of his design. He had the satisfaction to perceive that Brooks had gradually accommodated himself not a little to the element in which his brother-in-law Tongs was already floating happily; and the boy, his son, already put on the features of one over whose senses the strong liquor was momentarily obtaining the mastery. But these signs did not persuade him into any relaxation of his labours; on the contrary, encouraged by success, he plied the draughts more frequently and freely than before, and with additional evidence of the influence of the potations upon those who drank, when he found that he was enabled, unperceived, to deposite the contents of his own tumbler, in most instances, under the table around which they had gathered. In the cloud of smoke encircling them, and sent up from their several pipes, Bunce could perceive the face of his colleague in the conspiracy peering in occasionally upon the assembly, and at length, on some slight pretence, he approached the aperture agreeable to the given signal, and received from the hands of the landlord a phial containing a strong infusion of opium, which he placed cautiously in his bosom, and awaited the moment of more increased stupefaction to employ it. So favourably had the liquor operated by this time upon the faculties of all, that the elder Brooks grew garrulous and full of jest at the expense of his son-- who now, completely overcome, had sunk down with his head upon the table in a profound slumber. The pedler joined, as well as Tongs, in the merriment—this latter personage, by the way, having now put himself completely under the control of the ardent spirit, and exhibiting all the appearance of a happy madness. He howled like the wolf—imitated sundry animals—broke out into catches of song which he invariably failed to finish, and at length, grappling his brother-in-law, Brooks, around the neck, with both arms, as he sat beside Vol. II.—X him, he swore by all that was strong in Monongahely, he should give them a song. “That's jest my idee, now, Master Tongs. A song is a main fine thing, now, to fill up the chinks. First a glass, then a puff, or mayhap two, and then a song.” Brooks, who, in backwood parlance, was “considerably up a stump,”—that is to say, half drunk— after a few shows of resistance, and the utterance of some feeble scruples, which were all rapidly set aside by his companions, proceeded to pour forth the rude melody which follows:— THE HOW-D'YE-DO BOY. For a how-d'ye-do, boy, 'tis pleasure enough, (The world goes round, the world goes round) To have a sup of such goodly stuff— (The world goes round, the world goes round) To float away in a sky of fog, (The world goes round, the world goes round) And swim the while in a sea of grog; (The world goes round, the world goes round) But high or low, Let the world go. The how-d'ye-do boy don't care for it—no—no—no—no. The brother-in-law and son, who seemed to be familiar with the uncouth dithyrambic, repeated with the singer the regularly recurring second line, and this addition gave it surprising effect; the pedler joining in at the conclusion, and repeating the negative with prodigious compass of voice. The song proceeded— For a how-d'ye-do boy who smokes and drinks, (The world goes round, the world goes round) He does not care who cares or thinks— (The world goes round, the world goes round) Would Grief deny him to laugh and sing, (The world goes round, the world goes round) He knocks her down with a single sling— (The world goes round, the world goes round). So high or low, Let the world go, The how-d'ye-do boy don't care for it—no—no—no—no. The how-d'ye-do boy is a boy of the night— (The world goes round, the world goes round) It brings no cold, and it does not fright: (The world goes round, the world goes round) He buttons his coat and laughs at the shower, (The world goes round, the world goes round) And he has a song for the darkest hour— (The world goes round, the world goes round). So high or low, Let the world go— The how-d'ye-do boy don't care for it—no—no—no—no. The song gave no little delight to all parties— Tongs shouted, the pedler roared applause, and such was the general satisfaction, that it was no difficult thing to persuade Brooks to the demolition of a bumper, which Bunce adroitly proposed to the singer's own health. It was while the hilarity thus produced was at its loudest, that the pedler seized the chance to pour a moderate portion of the narcotic into the several glasses of his companions, while a second time filling them; but unfortunately for himself, not less than the design in view, just at this moment Brooks grew awkwardly conscious of his own increasing weakness,—having just reason enough left to feel that he had already drank too much. With a considerable show of resolution, therefore, he thrust away the glass so drugged for his benefit, and declared his determination to do no more of that business. He withstood all the suggestions of the pedler on the subject, and the affair began to look something less than hopeless when he proceeded to the wakening up of his son, who, overcome by the liquor, was busily employed in a profound sleep, with his head prone to the table. Tongs, who had lost nearly all the powers of action, though retaining not a few of his parts of speech, now came in fortunately to the aid of the rather discomfited pedler. Pouring forth a volley of oaths, in which his more temperate brother-in-law was denounced as a mean-spirited critter, who couldn't drink with his friend or fight with his enemy, he made an ineffectual effort to grapple furiously with the offender, while he more effectually arrested his endeavour to waken up his son. It is well, perhaps, that his animal man lacked something of its accustomed efficiency, and resolutely refused all co-operation with his mood; or, it is more than probable, such was his wrath, that his more staid brother-in-law would have been subjected to some few personal tests of blow and buffet. The proceedings throughout, suggested to the mind of the pedler a mode of executing his design, by proposing a bumper all round, with the view to healing the breach between the parties, and as a final draught preparatory to breaking-up. A suggestion so reasonable could not well be resisted; and with the best disposition in the world towards sobriety, Brooks was persuaded to assent to the measure. Unhappily, however, for the pedler, the measure was so grateful to Tongs, that before the former could officiate, the latter, with a desperate effort, reached forward, and possessing himself of his own glass, he thrust another, which happened to be the only undrugged one, and which Bunce had filled for himself, into the grasp of the jailer. The glass designed for Brooks was now in the pedler's own hands, and no time was permitted him for reflection. With a doubt as to whether he had not got hold of the posset meant for his neighbour, Bunce was yet unable to avoid the difficulty, and, in a moment, in good faith, the contents of the several glasses were fairly emptied by their holders. There was a pause of considerable duration; the several parties, Tongs particularly, sunk back quietly into their seats; and, supposing from appearances, that the effect of the drug had been complete, the pedler, though feeling excessively stupid and strange, had yet recollection enough to give the signal to his comrade. A moment only elapsed, when Munro entered the apartment, seemingly unperceived by all but the individual who had called him; and, as an air of considerable vacancy and repose overspread all the company, he naturally enough concluded the potion had taken due hold of the senses of the one whom it was his chief object to overcome. Without hesitation, therefore, and certainly asking no leave, he thrust one hand into the bosom of the worthy jailer, while the other was employed in taking a sure hold of his collar. To his great surprise, however, he found that his man had no lethargy, though severely bitten by the drink. Brooks made fierce resistance, though nothing at such a time, or indeed at any time, in the hands of one so powerfully built as Munro. “Hello! now—who are you, I say—hands off —Tongs—Tongs—hands off,—Tongs, I say—” But Tongs heard not, or heeded not, any of the rapid exclamations of the jailer, who continued to struggle. Munro gave a single glance to the pedler, whose countenance singularly contrasted with the expression which, in the performance of such a duty, and at such a time, it might have been supposed proper for it to have worn. There was a look from his eyes of most vacant and elevated beatitude—a simper sat upon his lips, whichparted ineffectually with the speech that he endeavoured to make. A still lingering consciousness of something to be done, prompted him to rise, however, X 2 and stumble towards the landlord, who, while scuffling with the jailer, thus addressed him:— “Why, Bunce, it's but half done—you've bungled. See, he's too sober by half.” “Sober—no, no—guess he's drunk—drunk as a gentleman. I say now—what must I do?” “Do,” muttered the landlord, between his teeth, and pointing to Tongs, who reeled and raved in his seat—“do as I do;” and at the word, with a single blow of his fist, he felled the still refractory jailer with as much ease as if he had been an infant in his hands. The pedler, only half conscious, turned nevertheless to the half-sleeping Tongs, and resolutely drove his fist into his face. It was at that moment that the nostrum, having taken its full effect, deprived him of the proper force which alone could have made the blow available for the design which he had manfully enough undertaken. The only result of the effort was to precipitate him, with an impetus not his own, though deriving much of its effect from his own weight, upon the person of the enfeebled Tongs; the toper clasped him round with a corresponding spirit, and they both rolled upon the floor in utter imbecility, carrying with them the table around which they had been seated, and tumbling into the general mass of bottles, pipes, and glasses, the slumbering youth, who, till that moment, lay altogether ignorant of the catastrophe. Munro, in the meanwhile, had possessed himself of the desired keys; and throwing a sack, with which he had taken care to provide himself, over the head of the still struggling but yet rather stupified jailer, he bound the mouth of it with cords closely around his body, and left him rolling, with more elasticity and far less comfort than the rest of the party, around the floor of the apartment. He now proceeded to look at the pedler, and seeing his condition, though much wondering at his falling so readily into his own temptation,—never dreaming of the mistake which he had made,—he did not waste time to get him up, as he plainly saw he could get no further service out of him. A moment's reflection taught him, that, as the condition of Bunce himself would most probably free him from any suspicion of design, the affair told as well for his purpose as if the original arrangement had succeeded. Without more pause, therefore, he left the house, carefully locking the doors on the outside so as to delay egress, and hastened immediately to the release of the prisoner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. “The chase we follow has no common price; Gold may not buy it—Gold may not restore, If once we lose it. Be your spirit strong, Firm set each muscle—never heed the stop— There is no hindrance which should catch your thought, When thus we ride for life.” The landlord lost no time in freeing the captive. A few minutes sufficed to find and fit the keys; and penetrating at once to the cell of Ralph Colleton, he soon made the youth acquainted with as much of the circumstances of his agency in the escape as might be thought necessary for the satisfaction of his immediate curiosity. He wondered at the part taken by Munro in the affair, but hesitated not to accept his assistance. Though scrupulous, and rigidly so, not to violate the laws, and having a conscientious regard to all human and social obligations, he saw no immorality in flying from a sentence, however agreeable to law, in all respects so greatly at variance with justice. A second intimation was not wanting to his decision, and without waiting until the landlord should unlock the chain which secured him, he was about to dart forward into the passage, when the restraining check which it gave to his forward movement, warned him of the difficulty. Fortunately, the obstruction was small; the master key, not only of the cells, but of the several locks to the fetters of the prison, was among the bunch of which the jailer had been dispossessed, and when found, it performed its office. The youth was again free, and a few moments only had elapsed, after the departure of Munro from the house of the pedler, when both Ralph and his deliverer were upon the high road, and bending their unrestrained course towards the Indian nation. “And now, young man,” said the landlord, “you are free. I have performed my promise to one, whose desire in this jumps full with my own. I should have been troubled enough had you perished for the death of Forrester, though, to speak the truth, I should not have risked myself, as I have done to-night, but for my promise to her.” “Who—of whom do you speak? To whom do I owe all this, if it comes not of your own head?” “And you do not conjecture? Have you not a thought on the subject? Was it likely, think you, that the young woman, who did not fear to go to a stranger's chamber at midnight, in order to save him from his enemy, would forget him altogether when a greater danger was before him?” “And to Miss Munro again do I owe my life? Noble girl! how shall I requite—how acknowledge my deep responsibility to her?” “You cannot!—I have not looked on either of you for nothing; and my observation has taught me all your feelings and hers. You cannot reward her as she deserves to be rewarded—as, indeed, she only can be rewarded by you, Mr. Colleton. Better, therefore, that you seek to make no acknowledgments.” “What mean you? Your words have a signification beyond my comprehension. I know that I am unable to requite services such as hers, and such an endeavour I surely should not attempt; but that I feel gratitude for her interposition may not well be questioned—the deepest gratitude—for in this deed, with your aid, she relieves me, not merely from death, but the worse agony of that dreadful form of death. My acknowledgments for this service were nothing, I am well aware; but these she shall have, and what else I can, without disrespect, offer.” “There is, indeed, one thing, Mr. Colleton—now that I reflect, which it may be in your power to do, and which may relieve you of some of the responsibilities which her interposition here and elsewhere imposes on you.” The landlord paused for a moment, and looked hesitatingly in Ralph's countenance. The youth saw and understood the expression, and replied readily. “Doubt not, Mr. Munro, that I shall do all things consistent with propriety, in my power to do, that may take the shape and character of requital for this service. Any thing for Miss Munro —for yourself or others—not incompatible with the character of the gentleman. Speak, sir—if you can suggest a labour of any description, not under this head, which would be grateful to yourself or her—fear not to speak, and rely upon my gratitude to serve you both.” “I thank you, Mr. Colleton—your frankness relieves me of some heavy thoughts, and I shall open my mind freely to you on the subject which now troubles it. I need not tell you what my course of life has been. I need not tell you what it is now. Bad enough, Mr. Colleton—bad enough, as you must know by this time. Life, sir, is uncertain with all persons, but far more uncertain with him whose life is such as mine. I know not the hour, sir, when I may be knocked on the head. I have no confidence in the people whom I go with— I have nothing to hope from the sympathies of society, or the protection of the laws; and I have now arrived at that time of life, when my own experience is hourly repeating in my ears the words of Scripture—“the wages of sin is death.” Mine has been a life of sin, Mr. Colleton, and I must look for its wages. These thoughts have been troubling me much of late, and I feel them particularly heavy now. But, don't think, sir, that fear for myself makes up my suffering. I fear for that poor girl, who has no protector, and may be doomed to the control of one who would make a hell on earth for all under his influence. He has made a hell of it for me.” “Who is he—whom do you mean?” “You should know him well enough by this time, for he has sought your life often enough already— GuyRivers. Well, as I say—I know not how long I shall be able to take care of and provide for that poor girl, whose wish has prompted me this night to what I have undertaken. She was my brother's child, Mr. Colleton, and a noble creature she is. If I live, sir, she will have to become the wife of Rivers—and though I love her as my own—as I have never loved my own—yet she must abide the sacrifice from which, while I live, there is no escape. But something tells me, sir, I have not long to live. I have a notion which makes me gloomy, and which has troubled me ever since you have been in prison. One dream comes to me every night—whenever I sleep—and I wake all over perspiration, and with a terror I'm ashamed of. In this dream I see my brother always, and always with the same expression. He looks at me long and mournfully, and his finger is uplifted, as if in warning. I hear no word from his lips, but they are in motion as if he spoke, and then he walks slowly away. Thus, for several nights has my mind been haunted, and I'm sure it is not for nothing. It warns me that the time is not very far distant when I shall receive the wages of a life like mine—the wages of sin—the death perhaps—who knows—the death of the felon.” “These are fearful fancies, indeed, Mr. Munro; and, whether we think on them or not, will have their influence over the strongest minded of us all: but the thoughts which they occasion to your mind, while they must be painful enough, may be the most useful, if they awaken regret of the past, and incite to amendment in the future. Without regarding them as the presentiments of death, or of any fearful change, I look upon them only as the result of your own calm reflections upon the unprofitable nature of vice; its extreme unproductiveness in the end, however enticing in the beginning; and the painful privations of human sympathy and society which are the inevitable consequences of its indulgence. These fancies are the sleepless thoughts, the fruit of an active memory, which, at such a time, unrestrained by the judgment, mingles up the counsels and the warnings of your brother and the past, with all the images and circumstances of the present time. But—go on with your suggestion. Let me do what I can for the good of those in whom you are interested.” “You are right—whatever may be my apprehensions, life is uncertain enough, and needs no dreams to make it more so. Still, I cannot rid myself of this impression, which sticks to me like a shadow. Night after night I have seen him—just as I saw him a year before he died. But his looks were full of meaning, and when his lips opened, though I heard not a word, they seemed to me to say—the hour is at hand. I am sure they spoke the truth, and I must prepare for it. If I live, Mr. Colleton, Lucy must marry Rivers—there's no hope for her escape. If I die, there's no reason for the marriage, for I can then bid him defiance. She is willing to marry him now merely on my account. If I perish before the marriage takes place, it will not take place, and she will then need a protector—” “Say no more,” exclaimed the youth, as the landlord paused for an instant—“say no more. It will be as little as I can say, when I assure you, that all that my family can do for her happiness, all that I can do—shall be done. Be at ease on this matter, and believe me that I promise you nothing which my heart would not strenuously insist upon my performing. She shall be a sister to me.” As he spoke, the landlord warmly pressed his hand, leaning forward from his saddle as he did so; but without a single accompanying word. The dialogue was continued, at intervals, in a desultory form, and without sustaining, for any length of time, any single topic. Munro seemed heavy with gloomy thoughts, and the sky now becoming lightened with the glories of the ascending moon, seemed to have no manner of influence over his sullen temperament. Not so with the youth. He grew elastic and buoyant as they proceeded—and his spirit rose, bright and gentle, as if in accordance with the pure lights which now disposed themselves, like an atmosphere of sublimated silver, throughout the forest. The thin clouds floating away from the parent orb no longer obscuring her progress, became tributaries, and were clothed in their most dazzling draperies—clustering around her pathway, and contributing, not a little, to the loveliness of that serene star from which they received so much. But the contemplations of the youth were not long permitted to run on in the gladness of his newly found liberty. On a sudden, the action of his companion became animated—he drew up his steed for an instant, then applying the rowel, exclaimed in a deep, but suppressed tone— “We are pursued—ride, now, for your life, Mr. Colleton; it is three miles to the river, and our horses will serve us well. They are chosen—give them the spur—and follow close after me.” Let us return to the village. The situation of the jailer, Brooks, and of his companions, as the landlord left them, will be readily remembered by the reader. It was not until the fugitives were fairly on the road, that the former, who had been pretty well stunned by the severe blow given him by Munro, recovered from his stupor; and he then laboured under the difficulty of freeing himself from the bag about his head and shoulders, and his incarceration in the dwelling of the pedler. The blow had come nigh to sobering him, and his efforts, accordingly, were not without success. He looked round in astonishment upon the condition of all things around him, ignorant of the individual who had wrested from him his charge, besides Vol. II.—Y subjecting his scull to the extravagant test which it had been so little able to resist or he to repel; and, almost ready to believe, from the equally prostrate condition of the pedler and his brother, that, in reality, the assailant by which he himself was overthrown was no other than the potent bottle-god of his brother's familiar worship. Such certainly would have been his impression but for the sack in which he had been enveloped, and the absence of his keys. The blow, which he had not ceased to feel, might have been got by a drunken man in a thousand ways, and was no argument to show the presence of an enemy; but the sack, and the keys—they brought instant conviction, and a rapidly increasing sobriety, which, as it duly provoked his capacity for reflection, was only so much more unpleasant than his drunkenness. But no time was to be lost, and the first movement, having essayed, though ineffectually, to kick his stupid guest and snoring brother-in-law into similar consciousness with himself, was to rush headlong to the jail, where he soon realized all the apprehensions which assailed him when discovering the loss of his keys. The prisoner was gone, and the riotous search which he soon commenced about the village collected a crowd, whose clamours, not less than his own, had occasioned the uproar which concluded the conference between Miss Colleton and Guy Rivers, as narrated in a previous chapter. The mob, approaching the residence of Colonel Colleton, as a place which might probably have been resorted to by the fugitive, brought the noise more imperiously to the ears of Rivers, and compelled his departure. He sallied forth, and in a little while ascertained the cause of the disorder. By this time the dwelling of Colonel Colleton had undergone the closest scrutiny. It was evident to the crowd, that, so far from harbouring the youth, they were not conscious of the escape; but of this Rivers was not so certain. He was satisfied in his own mind that the stern refusal of Edith to accept his overtures for the rescue, arose only from the belief that they could do without him. More than ever irritated by this idea, the outlaw was bold enough, relying upon his disguise, to come forward, and while all was indecisive in the multitude, to lay plans for a pursuit. He did not scruple to instruct the jailer as to what course should be taken for the recovery of the fugitive; and by his strong good sense and confidence of expression, he infused new hope into that heretofore much bewildered person. Nobody knew who he was, but as the village was full of strangers, who had never been seen there before, this fact occasioned neither surprise nor inquiry. His advice was taken, and a file of the Georgia Guard, which were on station in the village, now making their appearance, he suggested the course which they should pursue, and in few words gave the reasons which induced the choice. Familiar himself with all the various routes of the surrounding country, he did not doubt that the fugitive, under whatever guidance, for as yet he knew nothing of Munro's agency in the business, would take the most direct course to the Indian nation. All this was done, on his part, with an excited spirit, the result of that malignant mood which now began to apprehend the chance of being deprived of all its victims. Had this not been the case—had he not been present, the probability is, that in the variety of counsel, there would have been a far greater delay in the pursuit; but such must always be the influence of a strong and leading mind in a time of trial and popular excitement. Such a mind concentrates and makes effective the power which otherwise would have been wasted in air. His superiority of character was immediately manifest—his suggestions were adopted without dissent; and in a few moments, the two troopers, accompanied by the jailer, were in pursuit upon the very road taken by the fugitives. Rivers, in the meanwhile, though excessively anxious about the result of the pursuit, was yet too sensible of his own risk to remain much longer in the village. Annoyed not a little by the apprehended loss of that revenge which he had described as so delicious in contemplation to his mind, he could not venture to linger where he was, at a time of such general excitement and activity. With a prudent caution, therefore, more the result of an obvious necessity than of any accustomed habit of his life, he withdrew himself as soon as possible from the crowd, at the moment when Pippin—who never lost a good opportunity—had mounted upon a stump in order to address them. Breaking away just as the lawyer was swelling with some old truism, and perhaps no truth, about the rights of man and so forth, he mounted his horse, which he had concealed in the neighbourhood, and rode off to the solitude and the shelter of his den. There was one thing that troubled his mind along with its other troubles, and that was to find out who were the active parties in the escape of Colleton. In all this time, he had not for a moment suspected Munro of connexion with the affair—he had too much overrated his own influence over the landlord to permit of a thought in his mind detrimental to his conscious superiority. He had no clue, the guidance of which might bring him to the trail; for the jailer, conscious of his own irregularity, was cautious enough in suppressing every thing like a detail of the particular circumstances attending the escape; contenting himself, simply, with representing himself as having been knocked down by some persons unknown, and rifled of the keys while lying insensible. Rivers could only think of the pedler, and yet such was his habitual contempt for that person, that he dismissed the thought the moment it came into his mind. Troubled thus in spirit, and filled with a thousand conflicting notions, he had almost reached the rocks, when he was surprised to perceive, on a sudden, close at his elbow, the dwarfish figure of our old friend Chub Williams. Without exhibiting the slightest show of apprehension, the urchin resolutely continued his course along with the outlaw, unmoved by his presence, and with a degree of cavalier indifference which he had never ventured to manifest to that dangerous personage before. “Why, how now, Chub—do you not see me?” was the first inquiry of Rivers. “Can the owl see?—Chub is an owl—he can't see in the moonlight.” “Well, but, Chub—why do you call yourself an owl? You don't want to see me, boy, do you?” “Chub wants to see nobody but his mother— there's Miss Lucy now—why don't you let me see her? she talks jest like Chub's mother.” “Why, you dog, didn't you help to steal her away? Have you forgotten how you pulled away the stones? I should have you whipped for it, sir —do you know that I can whip—don't the hickories grow here?” “Yes, so Chub's mother said—but you can't whip Chub. Chub laughs—he laughs at all your whips. That for your hickories. Ha! ha! ha! Chub don't mind the hickories—you can't catch Chub, to whip him with your hickories. Try now, Y 2 if you can. Try—” and as he spoke he darted along with a rickety, waddling motion, half earnest in his flight, yet seemingly, partly with the desire to provoke pursuit. Something irritated with what was so unusual in the habit of the boy, and what he conceived only so much impertinence, the outlaw turned the horse's head down the hill after him, but, as he soon perceived, without any chance of overtaking him in so broken a region. The urchin all the while, as if encouraged by the evident hopelessness of the chase on the part of the pursuer, screeched out volley after volley of defiance and laughter—breaking out at intervals into speeches which he thought most likely to annoy and irritate. “Ha, ha, ha! Chub don't mind your hickories— Chub's fingers are long—he will pull away all the stones of your house, and then you will have to live in the tree top.” But on a sudden his tune was changed, as Rivers, half-irritated by the pertinacity of the dwarf, pulled out a pistol, and directed it at his head. In a moment, the old influence was predominant, and in undisguised terror he cried out— “Now don't—don't, Mr. Guy—don't you shoot Chub—Chub won't laugh again—he won't pull away the stones—he won't.” The outlaw now laughed himself at the terror which he had inspired, and beckoning the boy near him, he proceeded, if possible, to persuade him into a feeling of amity. There was a strange temper in him with reference to this outcast. His deformity—his desolate condition—his deficient intellect, inspired, in the breast of the fierce man, a feeling of sympathy, which he had not entertained for the whole world of humanity beside. Such is the contradictory character of the misled and the erring spirit. Warped to enjoy crime—to love the deformities of all moral things—to seek after and to surrender itself up to all manner of perversions, yet, in the long tissue, returning, at some few moments, to the original temper of that first nature not yet utterly departed, and few and feeble though the fibres be which still bind the heart to her worship, still strong enough at times to remind it of the true, however it may be insufficient to restrain it in its wanderings after the false. But the language and effort of the outlaw, though singularly kind, failed to have any of the desired effect upon the dwarf. With an unscrupulous refusal to enter the outlaw's dwelling-place in the rocks, he bounded away into a hollow of the hills, and in a moment was out of sight of his companion. Fatigued with his recent exertions, and somewhat more sullen than usual, Rivers entered the gloomy abode, into which it is not our present design to follow him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. “Oh, thou eternal Mover of the heavens, Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!— Oh, beat away the busy, meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul, And from his bosom purge the black despair.” King Henry VI. The fugitives, meanwhile, pursued their way, with the additional speed of men conscious that life and death hung upon their progress. There needed no exhortations from his companion to Ralph Colleton. More than life, with him, depended upon his speed. The shame of such a death as that to which he had been destined was for ever before his eyes, and with a heart nerved to its utmost by a reference to the awful alternative of flight, he grew reckless in the audacity with which he drove his horse forward in defiance of all obstacle and over every impediment. Nor were the present apprehensions of Munro much less than those of his companion. To be overtaken, as the participant of the flight of one whose life was forfeit, would necessarily invite to such an examination of himself as must result in the development of his true character, and such a discovery must only terminate in his conviction and sentence to the same doom. His previously uttered presentiment grew more than ever strong with the strengthening consciousness of his danger; and with an animation, the fruit of an anxiety little short of absolute fear, he stimulated the progress of Colleton, while himself driving the rowel ruthlessly into the smoking sides of the animal he bestrode. “On, sir—on, Mr. Colleton—this is no moment for graceful attitude. Bend forward—free rein—force spur. We ride for life—for life. They must not take us alive—remember that. Let them shoot— strike, if they please, but they must put no hands on us as living men. If we must die, why—any death but a dog's. Are you prepared for such a finish to your ride?” “I am—but I trust it has not come to that. How much have we yet to the river?” “Two miles at the least, and a tough road. They gain upon us—do you not hear them—we are slow—very slow. These horses—on, Syphax, dull devil—on—on!” And at every incoherent and unconnected syllable, the landlord struck his spurs into his animal, and incited the youth to do the same. “There is an old mill upon the branch to our left, where for a few hours we might lie in secret, but daylight would find us out. Shall we try a birth there, or push on for the river?” inquired Munro. “Push on, by all means—let us stop nowhere— we shall be safe if we make the nation,”—was the reply. “Ay, safe enough, but that's the rub. If we could stretch a mile or two between us, so as to cross before they heave in sight, I could take you to a place where the whole United States would never find us out—but they gain on us—I hear them every moment more and more near. The echoes are very clear to-night—always clearer and more distinct by moonlight, and they must hear us, as we hear them.” “But I hear them not—I hear no echoes but our own—” replied the youth. “Ah, that's because you have not the ears of an outlaw. There's a necessity for using our ears, one of the first that we acquire, and I can hear sounds farther, I believe, than any man I ever met, unless it be Guy Rivers. He has the ears of the devil, when his blood's up. Then he hears further than I can, though I'm not much behind him even then. Hark! they are now winding the hill not more than half a mile off, and we hear nothing of them now until they get round—the hill throws the echo to the rear, as it is more abrupt on that side than on this. At this time, if they heard us before, they cannot hear us. We could now make the old mill with some hope of their losing our track, as we strike into a blind path to do so. What say you, Master Colleton—shall we turn aside or go forward?” “Forward, I say. If we are to suffer, I would suffer on the high road, in full motion, and not be caught in a crevice like a lurking thief. Better be shot down—far better—I think with you—than risk recapture.” “Well—it's the right spirit you have, and we may clear them. We cease again to hear them. They are driving through the close grove where the trees hang so much over. God—it is but a few moments since we went through it ourselves— they gain on us—but the river is not far—speed on—bend forward, and use the spur—a few minutes more close pushing, and the river is in sight. Kill the beasts—no matter—but make the river.” “How do we cross?” inquired the youth, hurriedly, though with a confidence something increased by the manner of his companion. “Drive in—drive in—there are two fords, each within twenty yards of the other, and the river is not high. You take the path and ford to the right, as you come in sight of the water, and I'll keep the left. Your horse swims well,—so don't mind the risk; and if there's any difficulty, leave him, and take to the water yourself. The side I give you is the easiest; though it don't matter what side I take. I've gone through worse chances than this, and if we hold on for a few moments, we are safe. The next turn, and we are on the banks.” “The river—the river,” exclaimed the youth, involuntarily, as the broad and quiet stream wound before his eyes, glittering like a polished mirror in the moonlight. “Ay, there it is—now to the right—to the right. Look not behind you. Let them shoot—let them shoot, but lose not an instant to look. Plunge forward and drive in. They are close upon us, and the flat is on the other side. They can't pursue, unless they do as we, and they have no such reason for so desperate a course. They will stop—they will not follow. In—in—not a moment is to be lost—” and speaking, as they pursued their several ways, he to the left, and Ralph Colleton to the right ford, the obedient steeds plunged forward under the application of the rowel, and were fairly in the bosom of the stream, as the pursuing party rode headlong up the bank. Struggling onwards, in the very centre of the stream, with the steed, which, to do him all manner of justice, swam nobly, Ralph Colleton could not resist the temptation to look round upon his pursuers. Writhing his body in the saddle, therefore, a single glance was sufficient; and in the full glare of the moonlight, unimpeded by any interposing foliage, the prospect before his eyes was imposing and terrible enough. The pursuers were four in number—the jailer, two of the Georgia Guard, and another person unknown to him. As Munro had predicted, they did not venture to plunge in as the fugitives had done—they had no such fearful motive for the risk; and the few moments which they consumed in deliberation as to what they should do, contributed not a little to the successful experiment of the swimmers. But the youth at length caught a fearful signal of preparation,—his ear noted the sharp click of the lock, as the rifle was referred to in the final resort; and his ready sense conceived but of one, and the only mode of evading the danger so immediately at hand. Too conspicuous in his present situation to hope for escape, short of a miracle, so long as he remained upon the back of the swimming horse, he relaxed his hold, carefully drew his feet from the stirrups, resigned his seat, and only a second before the discharge of the rifle was deeply buried in the bosom of the Chestatee. The steed received the bullet in his head—plunged forward madly, to the no small danger of Ralph, who had now got a little before him—but in a few moments lay supine upon the stream, and was borne down by its current. The youth, practised in such exercises, pressed forward under the surface for a sufficient time to enable him to avoid the present glance of the enemy, and at length, in safety, rounding a jutting point of the shore, which effectually concealed him from their eyes, he gained the dry land, at the very moment in which Munro, with more success, was clambering, still mounted, up the steep sides of a neighbouring and slippery bank. Familiar with such scenes, the landlord had duly estimated the doubtful chances of his life in swimming the river directly in sight of the pursuers. He had therefore taken the precaution to oblique considerably to the left from the direct course, and did not, in consequence, appear in sight, owing to the sinuous windings of the stream, until he had actually gained the shore. The youth beheld him at this moment, and shouted aloud his own situation and safety. In a voice indicative of restored confidence in himself, no less than in his fate, the landlord, by a similar shout, recognised him, and was bending forward to the spot where he stood, when the sharp and joint report of three rifles from the opposite banks attested the discovery of his person; and, in the same instant, the rider tottered forward in his saddle—his grasp was relaxed upon the rein, and without a word, he toppled from his seat, and was borne for a few paces by his horse, dragged forward by one of his feet, which had not been released from the stirrup. He fell at length, and the youth came up with him. He heard the groans of the wounded man, and though exposing himself to the same chance, he could not determine upon flight. He might possibly have saved himself by taking the now freed animal which the landlord had ridden, and at once burying himself in the nation. But the noble weakness of pity determined him otherwise; and without scruple or fear, he resolutely advanced to the spot where Munro lay, though full in the sight of the pursuers, and prepared to render him what assistance he could. One of the troopers, in the mean time, had swum the river himself; and freeing the flat from its chains, had directed it across the stream for the passage of his companions. It was not long before they had surrounded the fugitives, and Ralph Colleton was again a prisoner, and once more made conscious of the dreadful doom from which he had, at one moment, almost conceived himself to have escaped. Munro had been shockingly wounded. One ball had pierced his thigh, inflicting a severe, though probably not a fatal wound. Another, and this had been enough, had penetrated directly behind the eyes, keeping its course so truly across, as to tear and turn the bloody orbs completely out upon the cheek beneath. The first words of the dying man were— “Is the moon gone down—lights—bring lights!” “No, Munro—the moon is still shining without a cloud, and as brightly as if it were day”—was the reply of Ralph. “Who speaks—speak again, that I may know how to believe him.” “It is I, Munro—I, Ralph Colleton.” “Then it is true—and I am a dead man. It is all over, and he came not to me for nothing. Yet, can I have no lights—no lights?—Ah!”—and the half reluctant reason grew more terribly conscious of his situation, as he thrust his fingers into the Vol. II.—Z bleeding sockets from which the fine and delicate conductor of light had been so suddenly driven. He howled aloud for several moments in his agony —in the first agony which came with that consciousness—but, recovering at length, he spoke with something of calm and coherence. “Well, Mr. Colleton—what I said was true. I knew it would be so; I had warning enough to prepare, and I did try, but it's come over soon and nothing is done. I have my wages, and the text spoke nothing but the truth. I cannot stand this pain long—it is too much—and—” The pause in his speech, from extreme agony, was filled up by a shriek that rung fearfully amid the silence of such a scene, but it lasted not long. The mind of the landlord was not enfeebled by his weakness, even at such a moment. He recovered and proceeded: “Yes, Mr. Colleton—I am a dead man. I have my wages—but my death is your life. Let me tell the story—and save you, and save Lucy,—and thus—(oh, could I believe it for an instant)—save myself! But no matter—we must talk of other things. Is that Brooks—is that Brooks beside me?” “No, it is I—Colleton.” “I know—I know”—impatiently—“who else?” “Mr. Brooks, the jailer—Ensign Martin and Brincle, of the Georgia Guard,” was the reply of the jailer. “Enough, then, for your safety, Mr. Colleton. They can prove it all, and then remember Lucy— poor Lucy! You will be in time—save her from Guy Rivers—Guy Rivers—the wretch—not Guy Rivers—no—there's a secret,—there's a secret for you, my men, shall bring you a handsome reward. Stoop—stoop, you three,—where are you? —stoop, and hear what I have to say. It is my dying word—and I swear it by all things, all powers, all terrors that can make an oath solemn with a wretch whose life is a long crime. Stoop—hear me—heed all—lose not a word—not a word—not a word. Where are you?” “We are here, beside you—we hear all that you say. Go on!” “Guy Rivers is not his name—he is not Guy Rivers—hear now—Guy Rivers is the outlaw for whom the governor's proclamation gives a high reward—a thousand dollars—the man who murdered Judge Jessup. Edward Creighton, of Gwinnett Court House—he is the murderer of Jessup—he is the murderer of Forrester, for whose death the life of Mr. Colleton here is forfeit. I saw him kill them both,—I saw more than that, but that is enough to save the innocent man and punish the guilty. Take down all that I have said. I, too, am guilty; would make amends, but it is almost too late—the night is very dark, and the earth swings about like a cradle. Ah—have you taken down on paper what I said!—I will tell you nothing more till all is written—write it down—on paper—every word— write that before I say any more.” They complied with his requisition. One of the troopers, on a scrap of paper furnished by the jailer, and placed upon the saddle of his horse, standing by, in the pale light of the moon, recorded word after word, with scrupulous exactness, of the dying man's confession. He proceeded duly to the narration of every particular of all past occurrences, as we ourselves have already detailed them to the reader, together with many more, unnecessary to our narrative, of which we had heretofore no cognizance. When this was done, the landlord required it to be read, commenting, during its perusal, and dwelling, with more circumstantial minuteness, upon many of its parts. “That will do—that will do. Now swear me, Brooks—you are in the commission,—lift my hand and swear me, so that nothing be wanting to the truth. What if there is no Bible”—he exclaimed, suddenly, as some one of the individuals present suggested a difficulty on this subject.— “What—because there is no Bible, shall there be no truth? I swear—though I have had no communion with God—I swear to the truth by him. Write down my oath—he is present—they say he is always present. I believe it now,—I only wish I had always believed it. I swear by him—he will not falsify the truth—write down my oath, while I lift my hand to him. Would it were a prayer— but I cannot pray—I am more used to oaths than prayers, and I cannot pray. Is it written—is it written? Look, Mr. Colleton, look—you know the law. If you are satisfied, I am. Will it do?” Colleton replied quickly in the affirmative, and the dying man went on:—“Remember Lucy—the poor Lucy. You will take care of her. Say no harsh words in her ears—but, why should I ask this of you, whom—Ah—it goes round—round—round —swimming—swimming. Very dark—very dark night, and the trees dance—Lucy—” The voice sunk into a faint whisper whose sounds were unsyllabled—an occasional murmur escaped them once after, in which the name of his niece was again apparent; exhibiting, at the last, the affection, however latent, which he entertained in reality for the orphan trust of his brother. In a few moments, and the form stiffened before them in all the rigid sullenness of death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. “Chafe as thou wilt, they have thee in their toils, The hunter's spear is fixed upon thy throat, And nothing now is left thee but to die.” The cupidity of his captors had been considerably provoked by the dying words of Munro. They were all of them familiar with the atrocious murder which, putting a price upon his head, had driven Creighton, then a distinguished member of the bar in one of the more civilized portions of the state, from the pale and consideration of society; and their anxieties were now entirely addressed to the new object which the recital they had just heard had set before them. They had gathered from the narrative of the dying man some idea of the place in which they would most probably find him; and though without a guide to the spot, and altogether ignorant of its localities, they determined—without reference to others, who might only subtract from their own share of the promised reward, without contributing much, if any aid, which they might not easily dispense with—at once to attempt his capture. This was the joint understanding of the whole party, Ralph Colleton excepted. In substance, the youth was now free. The evidence furnished by Munro only needed the recognition of the proper authorities to make him so; and, until this had been effected, he remained in a sort of understood restraint, but without any actual limitations. Pledging himself that they should suffer nothing from the indulgence, he mounted the horse Z 2 of Munro, whose body was cared for, and took his course back to the village; while, following the directions given them, the Guard and jailer pursued their way to the Wolf's Neck in their search after Guy Rivers. The outlaw had been deserted by nearly all his followers. The note of preparation and pursuit sounded by the State authorities, had inspired the depredators with a degree of terror, which the near approximation of the Guard, in strong numbers, to their most secluded places, had not a little tended to increase; and accordingly, at the period of which we now speak, the outlaw, deserted by all but one or two of the most adventurous—who were, however, careful enough of themselves to keep in no one place long, and cautiously to avoid their accustomed haunts—remained in his rock, in a state of gloomy despondency, not usually his characteristic. Had he been less stubborn—less ready to defy all chances and all persons, it is not improbable that Rivers would have taken counsel by their flight, and removed himself, for a time at least, from the scene of danger. But his native obstinacy, and that madness of heart which, as we are told, seizes first upon those whom God seeks to destroy, determined him against the judgment of others, and, in part, against his own, to remain where he was; probably in the fallacious hope that the storm would pass over, as, on so many previous occasions, it had already done, and leave him again free to his old practices in the same region. A feeling of pride which made him unwilling to take a suggestion of fear and flight from the course of others, had some share in this decision; and, if we add the vague hungering of his heart towards the lovely Edith, and possibly the influence of other pledges, and the imposing consideration of other duties, we shall not be greatly at a loss in understanding the injudicious indifference to the contiguous dangers, which appears to have distinguished the conduct of the otherwise politic and circumspect ruffian. That night, after his return from the village and the brief dialogue with Chub Williams, as we have already narrated it, he retired to the deepest cell of his den, and throwing himself into a seat, covering his face with his hands, he gave himself up to a meditation as true in its philosophy as it was humiliating throughout in its application to himself. Dillon, his lieutenant, if such a title may be permitted, in such a place and for such an adjunct—came to him shortly after his arrival, and in brief terms with a blunt readiness—which, coming directly to the point, did not offend the person to whom it was addressed—demanded to know what he meant to do with himself. “We can't stay here long,” said he, “the troops are gathering all round us. The country's alive with them, and in a few days we shouldn't be able to stir from the hollow of a tree without popping upon some of our hunters. In the Wolf's Neck they will surely seek us, for, though a very fine place for us while the country's thin, yet even its old owners, the wolves, would fly from it when the horn of the hunter rings through the wood. It won't be very long before they pierce to the very `nation,' and then we should have but small chance of a long grace. Jack Ketch would make mighty small work of our necks, in his hurry to go to dinner.” “And what of all this,—what is all this to me?” was the strange and rather phlegmatic response of the outlaw, who did not seem to take in the full meaning of his officer's speech, and whose mind, indeed, was at that moment wandering to far other considerations. Dillon seemed not a little astounded by this reply, and looked inquiringly into the face of the speaker, doubting, for a moment, his accustomed sanity. The stern look which his glance encountered, directed its expression elsewhere, and after a moment's pause, he replied— “Why, captain, you can't have thought of what I've been saying, or you wouldn't speak as you do. I think it's a great deal to both you and me, what I've been telling you; and the sooner you come to think so too, the better. It's only yesterday afternoon that I narrowly missed being seen at the forks by two of the Guard, well mounted, and with rifles. I had but the crook of the fork in my favour, and the hollow of the creek at the old ford where it's been washed away. They're all round us, and I don't think we're safe here another day. Indeed, I only come to see if you wouldn't be off with me, at once, into the `nation.”' “You are considerate, but must go alone. I have no apprehensions where I am, and shall not stir for the present. For yourself, you must determine as you think proper. I have no further hold on your service. I release you from the oath. Make the best of your way into the `nation'—ay, go yet farther; and, hear me, Dillon, go where you are unknown—go where you can enter society— seek for the fireside, where you can have those who, in the dark hour, will have no wish to desert you. I have no claim now upon you, and the sooner you `take the range' the better.” “And why not go along with me, captain? I hate to go alone, and hate to leave you where you are. I shan't think you out of danger while you stay here; and don't see any reason for you to do so.” “Perhaps not, Dillon; but there is reason, or I should not stay. We may not go together, even if I were to fly—our paths lie asunder. They may never more be one. Go you, therefore, and heed me not; and think of me no more. Make yourself a home in the Mississippi, or on the Red River, and get yourself a fireside and family of your own. These are the things that will keep your heart warm within you, cheering you in hours that are dark, like this.” “And why, captain,” replied the lieutenant, much affected—“why should you not take the course which you advise for me? Why not, in the Arkansas, make yourself a home, and with a wife—” “Silence, sir—not a word of that. Why come you to chafe me here, in my den? Am I to be haunted for ever with such as you, and with words like these?”—and the brow of the outlaw blackened as he spoke, and his white teeth knit together, fiercely gnashing for an instant, while the foam worked its way through the occasional aperture between them. The ebullition of passion, however, lasted not long, and the outlaw, in a moment, seemed conscious of its injustice. “I do you wrong, Dillon—but on this subject I will have no one speak. I cannot be the man you would have me; I have been schooled otherwise. My mother has taught me a different lesson,—her teachings have doomed me, and these enjoyments are now all beyond my hope.” “Your mother!” was the response of Dillon, in unaffected astonishment. “Ay, man—my mother. Is there any thing wonderful in that. She taught me this lesson with her milk—she sung it in lullabies over my cradle— she gave it me in the playthings of my boyhood— her schoolings have made me the morbid, the fierce criminal, from whose association all the gentler virtues must always desire to fly. If, in the doom which may finish my life of doom, I have any one person to accuse of all, that person is—my mother!” “Is this possible?—is it true?—it is strange, very strange.” “It is not strange—we see it every day—in almost every family. She did not tell me to lie— or to swindle, or to stab—No!—Oh, no! she would have told me that all these things were bad—but she taught me to perform them all. She roused my passions, and not my principles, into activity. She provoked the one, and suppressed the other. Did my father reprove my improprieties, she petted me, and denounced him. She crossed his better purposes, and defeated all his designs, until, at last, she made my passions too strong for my government, not less than hers, and left me, knowing the true, yet the victim of the false. What is more—while my intellect, in its calmer hours, taught me that virtue was the only source of true felicity, my ungovernable passions set the otherwise sovereign reason at defiance, and trampled it under foot. Yes—in that last hour of eternal retribution, if called upon to denounce or to accuse, I can point but to one as the author of all—the weakly fond, misjudging, misguiding woman who gave me birth. Within the last hour I have been thinking over all these things. I have been thinking how I had been cursed in childhood by one who surely loved me beyond all other things beside. I can remember how sedulously she encouraged and prompted my infant passions, uncontrolled by her reason, and since utterly unrestrainable by my own. How she stimulated me to artifices and set me the example herself, by frequently deceiving my father, and teaching me to disobey and deceive him. She told me not to lie, and she lied all day to him, on my account, and to screen me from his anger. She taught me the catechism, to say on Sunday, while during the week she schooled me in almost every possible form of ingenuity to violate all its precepts. She bribed me to do my duty, and hence my duty could only be done under the stimulating promise of a reward. She taught me that God was superior to all, and that he required obedience to certain laws, yet, as she hourly violated those laws herself in my behalf, I was taught to regard myself as far superior to him. Had she not done all this, I had not been here and thus: I had been what now I dare not think on.—It is all her work. The greatest enemy my life has ever known has been my mother.” “This is a horrible thought, captain, yet I cannot but think it true.” “It is true—I have analyzed my own history, and the causes of my character and fortunes now, and I charge it all upon her. From one influence I have traced another, until I have the sweeping amount of twenty years of crime and sorrow, and a life of hate, and probably a death of ignominy, all owing to the first ten years of my infant education, where the only teacher that I knew was the woman who gave me birth. But this concerns not you. In my calm mood, Dillon, you have the fruit of my reason—to abide its dictate I should fly with you—but I suffer from my mother's teachings even in this. My passions—my pride—my fierce hope, the creature of a maddening passion, will not let me fly, and I stay, though I stay alone, with a throat bare for the knife of the butcher, or the halter of the hangman. I will not fly.” “And I will stay with you. I can dare something too, captain, and you shall not say, that when the worst comes to the worst, Tom Dillon was the man to back out. I will not go either, and whatever is the chance, you shall not be alone.” Rivers, for a moment, seemed touched by the devotion of his follower, and spoke not for a brief interval; but suddenly the expression of his eye was changed, and he spoke briefly and sternly. “You shall not stay with me, sir. What, am I so low as this, that I may not be permitted to be alone when I will? Will my subordinates fly in my face, and presume to disobey my commands? Go, Dillon—have I not said that you must fly— that I no longer need your services? Why linger you, then, where you are no longer needed? I have that to perform which requires me to be alone, and I have no further time to spare you. Go— away!” “Do you speak in earnest, captain?” inquired the lieutenant, doubtingly, and with an expression of countenance of the most equivocal and uncertain character. “Am I so fond of trifling, that my officer asks me such a question?”—was the stern response. “Then I am your officer still—you will go with me, or I shall remain.” “Neither, Dillon. The time is past for such an arrangement. You are discharged from my service, and from your oath. The club has no further existence. Go—be a happy—a better man, in another part of the world. You have some of the weaknesses of your better nature still in you. You had no mother to change them into scorn, and strife, and bitterness. Go—you may be a better man, and have something, therefore, for which to live. I have not—my heart can know no change. It is no longer under the guidance of reason. It is quite ungovernable now. There was a time when—but why prate of this?—it is too late to think of, and only maddens the more. Besides, it makes not any thing with you, and would detain you without a purpose. Linger no longer, Dillon —speed to the west, and, at some future day, perhaps you shall see me when you least expect, and perhaps least desire it.” The manner of the outlaw was firm and commanding, and Dillon did not scruple long to recognise its requisitions. The parting was brief, though the subordinate was truly affected. He would have lingered still, but Rivers waved him off with a farewell, whose emphasis was effectual, and, in a few moments, the latter sat once more alone. His mood was that of one disappointed in all things, and, consequently, displeased and discontented with all things—querulously so. In addition to this temper, which was common to him, his spirit, at this time, laboured under a heavy feeling of despondency, and its gloomy sullenness was perhaps something lighter to himself while Dillon remained with him. We have seen the manner in which he had hurried that personage away. He had scarcely been gone, however, when the inconsistent and variable temper of the outlaw found utterance in the following soliloquy. “Ay, thus it is—they all desert me; and this is human feeling. They all fly the darkness, and this is human courage. They love themselves only, or you, only while you need no love; and this is human sympathy. I need all of these, yet I get none; and when I most need, and most desire, and most seek to obtain, I am the least provided. These Vol. II.—A a are the fruits which I have sown, however— should I shrink to gather them? Yet, there is one —but one of all, whom no reproach of mine could drive away, or make indifferent to my fate. But I will see her no more. Strange madness! The creature, who, of all the world, most loves me, and is most deserving of my love, I banish from my soul as from my sight.—And this is another fruit of my education—another curse that came with a mother —this wilful love of the perilous and the passionate —this scorn of the gentle and the soft—this fondness for the fierce contradiction—this indifference to the thing easily won—this thirst after the forbidden. Poor Ellen—so gentle, so resigned, and so fond of her destroyer—but I will not see her again. I must not—she must not stand in the way of my anxiety to conquer that pride which had ventured to hate or to despise me. I shall see Munro, and he shall lose no time in this matter. Yet, what can he be after—he should have been here before this —it now wants but little to the morning, and yet I have not slept.” Thus, striding to and fro in his apartment, the outlaw soliloquized at intervals. Throwing himself at length upon a rude couch that stood in the corner, he had disposed himself as it were for slumber, when the noise as of a falling rock attracted his attention, and without pausing, he cautiously took his way to the entrance, with a view to ascertaining the cause. He was not easily surprised, and the knowledge of surrounding danger made him doubly observant, and more than ever watchful. Let us now return to the party which had pursued the fugitives, and which, after the death of the landlord, had, as we have already narrated, adopting the design suggested by his dying words, had immediately set forth in search of the notorious outlaw, and of the reward put upon his head. Having already some general idea of the whereabouts of the fugitive, and the directions given by Munro having been of the most specific character, they found little difficulty, after a moderate ride of some four or five miles, in striking upon the path directly leading to the Wolf's Neck. At this time, fortunately for their object, they were encountered suddenly by our old acquaintance, Chub Williams, whom, but a little before, we had seen separating from the individual in whose pursuit they were now engaged. The deformed, for a while, rode alongside of the party, without seeming to recognise their existence, singing all the while a strange woodland melody of the time and region,—probably the production of some wayfaring village wit:— “Her frock it was a yaller, And she was mighty sprigh, And she bounced at many a feller, Who came a-fighting shy. Her eye was like a sarpent's eye, Her cheek was like a flower, But her tongue was like a pedler's clock, Twas a-striking every hour. And wasn't she the gal for me, And wasn't she, I pray, sir, And I'll be drot, if you say not, We'll fight this very day, sir. We'll fight this very day, sir.” “'Spose you reckon I don't see you, riding 'longside of me, and saying nothing, but listening to my song. I'm singing for my own self, and you oughtn't to listen—I didn't ax you, and I'd like to know what you're doing so nigh Chub's house.” “Why, where's your house, Chub?” asked one of the party. “You aint looking for it—is you? cause you can't think to find it a-looking down. I lives in the tree top when weather's good like to-night, and, when it aint, I go into the hollow. I've a better house than Guy Rivers—he don't take the tree at all, no how.” “And where is his house, Chub?” was the common inquiry of all the party. The dwarf looked at them for a few moments without speech, then with a whisper and a gesture significant of caution, replied— “If you're looking for Guy—'tain't so easy to find him if he don't want to be found, and you must speak softly if you hunt him whether or no. He's a bad man, that Guy—mother said so—and he lives a long way under the ground.” “And can't you show us where, Chub? We will give you money for your service.” “Hain't you got 'tatoes? Chub's hungry—hain't eat nothing to-night. Guy Rivers has plenty to eat, but he cursed Chub's mother.” “Well, show us where he is, and we'll give you plenty to eat. Plenty of potatoes and corn,” was the promise of the party. “And build up Chub's house that the fire burnt? Chub lives in the tree now. Guy Rivers' man burnt Chub's house, 'cause he said Chub was saucy.” “Yes, my boy, we'll build up your house, and give you a plenty to go upon for a year. You shall have potatoes enough for your life time, if you will show us how to come upon Guy Rivers to-night. He is a bad fellow, as you say; and we won't let him trouble you any more, if you'll only show us where he is to be found.” “Well—I reckon I can,” was the response, something more readily given than was the wont of the speaker. “Chub and Guy talked together to-night, and Guy wanted Chub to go into his house in Wolf's Neck; but it's a dark place, and Chub's afeared in the dark.” “But you mustn't be afraid now. We shall be here and follow you close—so there will be no danger. All that we ask you to do, is to find out where he is, and let us know, and if we catch him, we'll give you all we promised. We'll build the house, and give you potatoes, and a jug of whiskey.” “Whiskey too—and build the house again for Chub's mother—and potatoes? Chub's ready.” With a sagacity something inconsistent with his general idiocy, he gave some instructions for the party which indicated a perfect consciousness of the somewhat dangerous undertaking which they had in view; and, according to his directions, the troopers having reached a certain point contiguous to Wolf's Neck, were made to dismount by their idiot guide, and having fastened his, with their horses, in the shade of a small clump of brushwood, he bade them follow him with cautious tread along the margin of the road, studiously avoiding, as they did so, the dry leaves and withered branches and every movement productive of unnecessary noise. Sometimes, proceeding with the singularly rapid motion which belonged to him, they lost sight of him at moments, and preparing for this, he had advised them of the route to follow, by breaking a bush on such occasions, and leaving it at every point in the path in which a difficulty might be anticipated to occur. The great extent of the rocky cavities generally styled the Wolf's Neck, diverging, as some of its ramifications did, to various and remote points from the centre, rendered A a 2 such precaution necessary, since those on the outside could not well discover in many cases in which cavities were below, any external indications of the fact. Having now brought them to positions which gave them a commanding view of various points at the same moment, Chub instructed them to place themselves out of sight, and to await the result of the experiment he was about to try, to determine, without any risk to himself, the precise position of the outlaw at that moment. Accordingly, arming himself with a rock, scarcely smaller than his head, he contrived to secure it about his person, while, with the rapidity of a squirrel, he ascended a tree overlooking, like the others, the dwelling of the fugitive. Having first carefully ensconced himself within the sheltering branches, which he had so chosen as effectually to conceal him, he plunged the stone from his high perch in such a manner as to determine for it a rolling course down the declivity of the hill, even after it had fairly struck the earth. The stone did its duty precisely as required, and the pursuing party had the satisfaction, as we have already narrated, to behold the object of their aim emerge from the cave, and closely scrutinize the scene around him. As if satisfied that the cause of the disturbance was purely occasional, and was not the effect of design, Rivers returned to his den, and again throwing himself upon the couch of his inner apartment, appeared disposed to yield himself up to sleep. Having allowed some little time to elapse after the re-ingress of the outlaw, his hunters descended from their several points of observation, and proceeded to arrange the circumstances of his capture. In this matter Chub could help them but little. He could describe, in some particulars, such of the interior as he had, perforce, been enabled to see on a former occasion, but beyond this he could do nothing; and he was resolute not to hazard himself in entering the dominion of a personage, so fearful as Guy Rivers had been represented by his mother to his uncouth imagination. Accordingly, he staid without, closely gathered up into a lump, behind a tree, while the more determined Georgians penetrated with cautious pace into the dark avenue known in the earlier days of the colony as a retreat for the wolves when they infested that portion of the country, and hence distinguished by the appellation of the Wolf's Neck. For some time they groped onward in great uncertainty as to their course, but a crevice in the wall, at one point, gave them a glimmer of the moonlight, which, falling obliquely upon the side of the cavern, pointed out to their eyes another passage, diverging from that in which they were. They followed its course, until their further progress was arrested by a solid wall, encountering them directly in front. Here they were at a stand, until one of the party, groping along the obstruction, placed his hand upon some drapery, which hung down and yielded to the pressure, appearing to answer all the purposes of a curtain. This discovery was important—it led directly to the chamber of Rivers, in which he then lay, not asleep, but weary with fatigue, and exhausted from trying excitements. Heretofore they had gone on in perfect secrecy. The individual who had discovered the curtain motioned to his companions, and raising its folds from the bottom, listened with suppressed respiration, while he endeavoured to gather whatever sound of life might be going on within. Rivers, half asleep, and enfeebled by exhaustion of one kind or other, breathed hard and quick—occasionally, a muttered monosyllable breaking from his lips would indicate the still restless mind, always at strife with the weaker clay in which it was imprisoned. Words might be distinguished, at moments, as his feverish form was thrown from one side to the other upon his couch—but such words—they were curses— imprecations upon himself, upon all, mingled too with an occasional lamenting—the tribute which vice invariably pays to virtue—for the high places from which he had for ever fallen. The Georgian, who was of powerful frame and great muscular activity, with a cautious hand, lifting the curtain sufficiently for that purpose, on hands and knees, made his way fairly into the apartment. He was followed in the same manner by one of his companions, but the imprudent forwardness of the third desiring admission, who was the jailer Brooks, was productive of some interruption to their onward progress. Not stooping as they had done sufficiently, yet at the same time pressing forward with no small haste, his head struck the beam which projected across the entrance and from which the curtain hung, and he was precipitated back into the passage through which he had come. The noise aroused fully the half-dozing man, and with the energy and decision which was a marked feature of his character, he sprang forward with his dirk, and, familiar with all the sinuosities of his den, in darkness and in light, the chances would have been, in any other circumstances, something in his favour. But the very precipitation of the jailer, while it occasioned the alarm, had the effect, in one particular, of neutralizing its evil consequences. The two who had already penetrated the apartment, had not yet risen from their knees, and having no thought of such an obstruction, the impediment, which in that position they offered to the step the outlaw was about to take, served their purposes just as well, probably, as the original design would have done. As he leaped forward from his couch towards the passage way, his feet were caught by the Georgian who first entered, and so great was the impetus of his first awakening effort, that he was precipitated with a severe fall over the second; and half stunned, yet still striking furiously, the dirk of Rivers found a bloodless sheath in the earthen floor of the cell. In a moment the two were upon him, and by the mere weight of their bodies alone, they kept him down. Conscious of the inutility of such an endeavour, the outlaw, as soon as he could properly appreciate his situation, ceased all further struggle; without difficulty the captors bound him, and he was borne forth in silent triumph to the entrance of the cave, where Chub Williams came forward to meet them. The dwarf now approached the captive with a new confidence. He felt that his fangs were taken off, and his survey of the person his mother had taught him so to dread, was as curious as that which he would have taken of some foreign monster. As he continued this survey, Rivers, with a singular degree of calmness for such a time and such circumstances, addressed him:— “So, Chub—this is your work;—you have brought enemies to my home, and yet I gave bread to yourself and your mother. Why have you done this?” “Guy Rivers cursed Chub's mother—Guy Rivers' man burnt down Chub's house, and Guy wanted to shoot Chub on the tree.” “But didn't I keep the man from shooting you when you run away from the cave—I would have been your friend, boy—and I did not curse your mother. But go—” and half muttering to himself, and half in the hearing of the boy, he went on, as it were, in soliloquy—“so wretched, yet so revengeful—desolate, I would have taken him to my kindness, as of kin in desolation, and this is the reward. He has had nothing but kindness from me, and yet —but I am your prisoner, gentlemen—I am not unwilling. Lead on.” Without interruption, they reached the village of Chestatee at an early hour on the ensuing day, and Guy Rivers, otherwise Creighton, the outlaw, was safely locked up in the prison from which his more fortunate rival Colleton had so recently escaped. A better provision was now made for the security of the prison, and a detachment of the Georgia Guard marching that very day into the village, totally destroyed any hope of rescue that the captive might possibly have entertained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. “What boots it now, to tell the tale, Of hapless love and hopeless wail— To chide the changeful fortune now, That scorn'd the dream and stay'd the vow— Time, while it robs away each hope, Can never well with memory cope; And love, that scorns oblivion, yet Can never, where it sigh'd, forget.” We have already seen the return of Lucy Munro to the village inn of Chestatee, where, to her own and the surprise of all, her aunt had been reinstated in her old department of house-keeper, as she had held it in times past. The reasons have been already narrated to the reader, which had determined the landlord upon this measure, and we are satisfied to say that all things, so far as the law of householdery is concerned, now went on with the accustomed economy; for the old lady, having some reputation in her way, could manage the cold baked meats with most praiseworthy capacity. The indisposition of Lucy was not materially diminished by the circumstances following the successful effort to persuade the landlord to the rescue of Ralph Colleton. The feverish excitements natural to that event, and even the fruit of its fortunate issue, in the death of Munro, for whom she really had much regard, were not greatly lessened, though certainly something relieved, by the capture of Rivers and his identification with the outlawed Creighton. She was now secure from him: she had nothing further to apprehend from the prosecution of his fearful suit; and the death of her uncle, even if the situation of Rivers had left him free to urge it further, would, of itself, have relieved her from the only difficulty in the way of a resolute denial. So far, then, she was at peace. But a silent sorrow had made its way into her bosom, gnawing there with the noiselessness and certainty of the imperceptible worm, generated by the sunlight, in the richness of the fresh leaf, and wound up within its folds. She had no word of sorrow in her speech—she had no tear of sorrow in her eye—but there was a vacant sadness in the vague and wan expression of her face, that needed neither tears nor words for its perfect development. She was the victim of a passion which, as hers was a warm and impatient spirit, was doubly dangerous; and the greater pang of that passion came with the consciousness, which now she could no longer doubt, that it was entirely unrequited. She had beheld the return of Ralph Colleton—she had heard from other lips than his of his release, and of the atoning particulars of her uncle's death, in which he furnished all that was necessary in the way of testimony to the youth's enlargement and security; and though she rejoiced, fervently and deeply, at the knowledge that so much had been done for him, and so much by herself, she yet had no escape from the deep sadness of mood which necessarily came with her hopelessness. Busy tongues dwelt upon the loveliness of the maiden who had sought him in his prison—of her commanding stature—her elegance of form—her dignity of manner and expression, coupled with the warmth of a devoted love, and a passionate admiration of the youth, who had also so undesiringly made the conquest of her heart. She heard all this in silence, but not without thought. She thought of nothing beside. The forms and images of the two happy lovers were before her eyes at all moments, and her active fancy pictured the full enjoyments common to their mutual feelings, in colours so rich and warm, that, in utter despondency at last, she would throw herself listlessly upon her couch, with sometimes an unholy hope that she might not again rise from it. But she was not forgotten. The youth she had so much served, and so truly saved, was neither thoughtless nor ungrateful. Having just satisfied those most near and dear to him of his safety, and of the impunity which, after a few brief forms of law, the dying confession of the landlord had given him; and having taken, in the warm embrace of a true love, the form of the no longer withheld Edith, he felt that his next duty was to her, for whom his sense of gratitude soon discovered that every form of acknowledgment must necessarily prove weak. At an early hour, therefore,—these several duties having been done,—Ralph made his appearance at the village inn, and the summons of the youth soon brought Lucy from her chamber. She came freely and without hesitation, though her heart was tremulous with doubt and sorrow. She had nothing now to learn of her utter hopelessness, and her strength was gathered from her despair. Ralph was shocked with the surprising ravages which a few days of indisposition had made upon that fine and delicate richness of complexion and expression, which had marked her countenance before. He had no thought that she was unhappy beyond the cure of time. On the contrary, with a modesty almost coupled with dulness, having had no idea of his own influence over the maiden, he was disposed to regard the recent events—the death of Munro, capture of Rivers, &amp;c.—as they relieved her from a persecution which had been cruelly afflictive, rather calculated to produce a degree of relief, to which she had not for a long time been accustomed; and which, though mingled up with events that prevented it from being considered matter for rejoicing, was yet not a matter, for one in her situation, very greatly to deplore. Her appearance, however, only made him more assiduously gentle and affectionate in the duties he had undertaken to perform. He approached her with the freedom of one warranted by circumstances in recognising in her person a relation next to the sweetest and the dearest in life. With the familiar regard of a brother, he took her hand, and placing her beside him on the rude sofa of the humble parlour, he proceeded to those little inquiries after her health and of those about her, which usually form the initial topics of all conversation. He proceeded then to Vol. II.—B b remind her of that trying night, when, in defiance of female fears, and laudably regardless of those staid checks and restraints by which her sex would conceal or defend its weaknesses, she had dared to save his life. His manner, generally warm and precipitous, dilated something beyond its wont; and if ever gratitude had yet its expression from human lips and in human language, it was poured forth at that moment from his into the ears of Lucy Munro. And she felt its truth, she relied upon the uttered words of the speaker, and her eyes grew bright with a momentary kindling, her cheek flushed under his glance, while her heart, losing something of the chillness which had so recently oppressed it, felt lighter and less desolate in that abode of sadness and sweetness, the bosom in which it dwelt. Yet, after all, when thought came again under the old aspect—when she remembered his situation and her own, she felt the shadow once more come over her with an icy influence. It was not gratitude which her heart craved from that of Ralph Colleton. The praise and the approval and the thanks of others might have given her pleasure, but these were not enough from him; and she sighed that he from whom alone love would be valuable, had nothing less frigid than his gratitude to offer. But even that was much, and she felt it deeply. His approbation was not a little to a spirit whose reference to him was perpetual; and when—her hand in his—he recounted the adventures of that night—when he dwelt upon her courage—upon her noble disregard of opinions which might have chilled in many of her sex the fine natural currents of that godlike humanity, which conventional forms, it is well to think, cannot always fetter or abridge—when he expatiated upon all these things with all the fervour of his temperament, while with a due modesty, shrinking from the recital of its own performances, she sought to restrain him—she felt every moment additional pleasure in his speech of praise. When, at length, relating the particulars of the escape and death of Munro, he proceeded, with all the tender precaution of a brother, softening the sorrow into sadness, and plucking from grief as much of the sting as would else have caused the wound to rankle, she felt that though another might sway his heart and its richer affections, she was not altogether destitute of its consideration and its care. “And now, Lucy—my sweet sister—for my sister you are now—you will accede to your uncle's prayer and mine—you will permit me to be your brother, and to provide for you as such. In this wild region it fits not that you should longer abide. This wilderness is uncongenial—it is foreign to a nature like yours. You have been too long its tenant—mingling with creatures not made for your association, and none altogether capable of appreciating your worth. You must come with us, and live with my uncle—with my cousin Edith—” “Edith?”—and she looked inquiringly, while a slight flush of the cheek and kindling of the eye in him, followed the utterance of the single word by her, and accompanied his reply. “Yes, Edith—Edith Colleton, Lucy, is the name of my cousin, and the relationship will soon be something closer than that between us. You will love her, and she, I know, will love you as a sister, and even as the preserver of one so very humble as myself. It was a night of danger when you first heard her name, and saw her features; and when you and she will converse over that night and its events, I feel satisfied that it will bring you both only the closer to one another.” “We will not talk of it farther, Mr. Colleton—I would not willingly hear of it again. It is enough that you are now free from all such danger— enough that all things promise well for your happiness in the future. Let not any thought of past evil or of risk successfully encountered, obscure the prospect—let no thought of me produce an emotion hostile, even for a moment, to your peace.” “And why should you think, my sweet girl, and with an air of such profound sorrow, that such a thought must be productive of such an emotion. Why should the circumstances so happily terminating, though perilous at first, necessarily bring sorrow with remembrance. Surely you are now but exhibiting the sometimes coy perversity which is ascribed to your sex. You are now, in a moment of calm, but assuming those winning playfulnesses of a sex, conscious of charm and power, which, in a time of danger, your more masculine thought had rejected as unbecoming. You forget, Lucy, that I have you in charge —that you are now my sister—that my promise to your departed uncle, not less than my own desire to that effect, makes me your guardian for the future—and that I am now come, hopeful of success, to take you with me to my own sweet country, and to bring you acquainted with her—(I must keep no secret from you, who are my sister)—who has my heart—who—but you are sick, Lucy. What means this emotion?” “Nothing, nothing, Mr. Colleton. A momentary weakness from my late indisposition—it will soon be over. Indeed, I am already well. Go on, sir —Go on!” “Lucy, why these epithets? Surely I have done nothing which should compel you to such formality. Have I not spoken as one who would not offend—as one who would have you nearer to him than the mere casualty, to whom you may, and must, if only for repulsion's sake, say `Sir and Mr.' Speak to me as if I were the new friend, at least, if you will not behold in me an old one. I have received too much good service from you to permit of this constraint. Call me Ralph—or Colleton— or—or—nay, look not so coldly—why not call me your brother?” “Brother—brother be it then, Ralph Colleton— brother—brother. God knows, I need a brother, now!” and the ice of her manner was thawed quickly by his appeal, in which her accurate sense, sufficiently unclouded usually by her feelings, though themselves at all times strong, discovered only the earnestness of truth. “Ah, now, you look—and now you are indeed my sister. Hear me then, Lucy, and listen to all my plans. You have not seen Edith—my Edith now—she must be your sister too. She is now, or will be soon, something nearer to me than a sister —she is something dearer already. We shall immediately return to Carolina, and you will go along with us.” “It may not be, Ralph—I have determined otherwise. I will be your sister—as truly so as sister possibly could be—but I will not go with you. I have made other arrangements.” The youth looked up in astonishment. The manner of the maiden was firm and conclusive, and he knew not what to understand. She proceeded, as she saw his amazement:— “It may not be as you propose, Mr.—Ralph— my brother—circumstances have decreed another arrangement—another, and perhaps a less grateful, destiny for me.” “But why, Lucy, if a less pleasant, or at least a doubtful arrangement, why yield to it—why reject my solicitation? What is the plan to which, I B b 2 am sad to see, you so unhesitatingly give the preference?” “Not unhesitatingly—not unhesitatingly, I assure you. I have thought upon it deeply and long, and the decision is that of my cooler thought and calmer judgment. It is true as I have said it. It may be in a thousand respects a less fortunate one than that which you have made for me; but, at least, it will want one circumstance which would couple itself with your plan, and which would alone prompt me to deny myself all of its other advantages.” “And what is that one circumstance, dear Lucy, which affrights you so much? Let me know—what peculiarity of mine—what thoughtless impropriety —what association, which I may remove, thus prevents your acceptance of my offer, and that of Edith. Speak—spare me not in what you shall say —but let your thoughts have their due language, just as if you were—as indeed you are—my sister.” “Ask me not, Ralph. I may not utter it. It must not be whispered to myself, though I perpetually hear it. It is no impropriety—no peculiarity—no wrong thought or deed of yours, that occasions it. The evil is in me; and hence you can do nothing which can possibly change my determination.” “Strange, strange girl! What mystery is this? Where is now that feeling of affinity, of confidence, which led you to comply with my prayer, and consider me as your brother? Why keep this matter from me—why withhold a particular, the knowledge of which might be productive of a remedy for all the difficulty.” “Never—never. The knowledge of it would be destructive of all beside. It would be fatal— seek not, therefore, to know it—it would profit you nothing, and me it would crush for ever to the earth. Hear me, Ralph—my brother!—hear me. Hitherto you have known me—I am proud to think—as a strong-minded woman, heedless of all things in her desire for the good—for the right. In a moment of peril to you or to another, I would be the same woman. But the strength which supports through the trial, subsides with the difficulty. The ship that battles with the storms and the seas, with something like a kindred buoyancy,goes down with the calm that follows their first violence. It is so with me. I could do much—much more than woman generally in the day of trial, but I am the weakest of my sex when it is over. Would you have the secret of these weaknesses in your possession, when you must know that the very consciousness, that it is beyond my own control, must be fatal to that pride of sex which, perhaps, only sustains me now. Ask me not, Ralph, further on this subject. I can tell you nothing; I will tell you nothing; and to press me farther must only be to estrange me the more. It is sufficient that I call you brother—that I pledge myself to love you as a sister —as sister never loved brother before. Is not this much, Ralph Colleton—is it not enough?” The youth tried numberless other modes, but in vain, to shake her purpose; and the sorrowful expression of his voice and manner, not less than of his language, sufficiently assured her of the deep mortification which he felt upon her denial. She soothed the spirit with a gentleness peculiarly her own, and as if she had satisfied herself that she had done enough for the delicacy of her scruples in one leading consideration, she took care that her whole manner should be that of the most confiding and sisterly regard. She even endeavoured to be cheerful, seeing that her companion, with her unlooked-for denial, had lost all his elasticity; but without doing much to efface from his countenance the traces of dissatisfaction. “And what are your plans, Lucy? Let me know them, at least. Let me see how far they are likely to be grateful to your character, and to make you happy.” “Happy! happy!”—and she uttered but the two words, with a brief interval between them, while her voice trembled, and the gathering suffusion in her large and thickly-fringed blue eyes attested, more than any thing beside, the presence of that prevailing weakness of which she had spoken. “Ay, happy, Lucy. That is the word. You must not be permitted to choose a lot in life, in which the chances are not in favour of your happiness.” “I look not for that now, Ralph,” was her reply, and with such hopeless despondency visible in her face as she spoke, that, with a deeper interest, taking her hand, he again urged the request she had already so recently denied. “And why not, my sweet sister? Why should you not anticipate happiness as well as the rest of us. Who has a better right to happiness than the young, the gentle, the beautiful, the good?— And you are all of these, Lucy. You have the charms—the richer and more lasting charms, which, in the reflective mind, must always awaken admiration. You have animation, talent, various and wide—sentiment, the growth of truth, propriety, and a lofty aim—no flippancy, no weak homage of self—and—nay, my sweet Lucy, shrink not back, and look not so imploringly mortified— and a gentle beauty, that woos while it warms— having the purity of the cloudless moonlight, with all the kindling richness of a star, when the eye may single out but one, as if in defiance of the tempest, shining down from the heavens, in place of all the rest.” “You mock me—I pray you mock me not. I have suffered much, Mr. Colleton—very much, in the few last years of my life, from the sneer, and the scorn, and the control of others. But I have been taught to hope for different treatment, and a far gentler estimate. It is ill in you to take up the speech of smaller spirits, and when the sufferer is one so weak, so poor, so very wretched as I am now. I had not looked for this from you.” The words, the manner, were full of offended pride, and of a dignity resolute to assert itself, even upon the slightest suspicion of assault. Ralph took her hand gently in his own, and looked appealingly in her face. “You do me wrong, Lucy; and your thought is one, which, perhaps, explains your denial. You estimate me by a standard so low, that you can give me no confidence—” “Oh, no! no—believe me—any thing but that.” “And do I look like one who could sneer at you, Lucy. Have I been so idle usually in my speech —have I been, at all, the flippant trifler with your sex—the self-assured fopling, to whom childish flatteries, meant only for the silly ear, are the cherished familiarities? I have not surely striven for such a character, and I would not have you so esteem me. What I have said, I have said truly. I think you what I have dared to say you are. I have spoken of your beauty and your many charms, not simply because of them, for, had you not, at the same time, been securely possessed of a high intelligence and strong sense, I had said nothing, in your ears, of your own praise. I am not used to this; and am sincerely honest when I say, that I can see no reason why, with attractions like yours, you should speak so doubtingly of your chances of happiness. These chances will be yours. Come with me—come with my Edith. Let me not speak in praise of my own country, when I promise that in Carolina, your various merits will not long want for homage. They will come—believe me, Lucy—almost worthy of you —to bend before you. The young and the gallant —our nobles—and nature's nobles too, will be glad to love you, and will freely offer themselves for your favour—” “No more, Ralph; no more of this. It may not be. I have already determined. I shall still remain with my aunt, who is now destitute like myself. We have money—my uncle has at least left us well provided in that respect. We shall therefore be at no loss, nor find it difficult to leave this region for another. We shall go to a section of the country more civilized in its aspect than this; where indeed your regards will find nothing to regret, and no reason to apprehend, for us. We go among the relatives of my mother, and I shall be there as perfectly at home, and as perfectly happy, as I can be anywhere.” “And will you not tell me, Lucy, where this future and more favoured dwelling is to be?” “Better that I should not—better, far better. The duties for which the high Providence brought us together, have been, I think, fairly accomplished. I have done my part, and you, Mr. Colleton— Ralph, I mean—you have done yours. There is nothing more that we may not do apart. Here then let our conference end. It is enough that you have complied with the dying wish of my uncle— that I have not, is not your fault.” “Not my fault, Lucy, but truly my misfortune. But I give not up my hope so easily. I still trust that you will think better of your determination, and conclude to go with us. We have a sweet home, and should not be altogether so happy in it, with the thought of your absence for ever in our minds.” “What—not happy, and she with you?” “Happy—yes—but far happier with both of you. You, my sister, and—” “Say no more—” “No more now, but I shall try other lips, perhaps more persuasive than mine. Edith shall come—” “Let her not, I beg you—bring her not here— I will not see her—I would not look upon her for the world—” and as she spoke these words with a sudden energy, which had not before marked her conversation, she started from her seat, and made an effort to leave the room, but a sickness came over her senses, her eyes closed, and she sank back fainting in the arms of Ralph, which were extended just in time to sustain her. In that last speech, and the paroxysm which followed it, Ralph Colleton had discovered her secret. He could be blind no longer; and placing her gently, while yet utterly unconscious, in the arms and charge of the old lady, who just then entered the apartment, he seized the opportunity to retire, with feelings of sadness, highly honourable to that manliness and straightforward honesty of character, of which, indeed, he was a noble specimen. He entered the temporary home of his betrothed, with a tearful sorrow which awakened all her inquiries. “She will come, Ralph?”—exclaimed Edith, as he entered the room. “The sweet creature—she will come, will she not, and I may now see her, may I not?” “She will not come, Edith—and, be not surprised, my love, she declines seeing you. Edith, my own Edith—you know me well—and know that I would not deceive you. Do you think that I could have done or said any thing calculated to deceive another, and to mislead them with a thought not honestly my own? Tell me, dear Edith—thus much is necessary to free me from the doubt which I now have, whether I have altogether pursued the course of a gentleman with Lucy.” The maiden looked at him fixedly for an instant. Then, as she observed the deep sentiment of sadness and doubt diffused over all his features,— when she saw how sincerely he felt the sorrow which he had beheld preying upon the heart of the poor desolate of love he had just left—her thought at once freed him from the suspicion from which his own thought had not altogether freed himself. She at once replied:— “No, Ralph—afflict not yourself—doubt not the perfect propriety of your conduct. I have no doubt of it. You are all nobleness, and I fear not that you have been guilty of injustice in this matter. I understand your meaning, and will see Lucy myself. She shall know me—she shall not avoid me. She may shrink from you, Ralph, as from a brother; but me she shall know and acknowledge as a sister.” “My own, my generous Edith—it was ever thus —you are always the noble and the true. Go, then, but go alone. Relieve me from this sorrow if you can. I need not say to you, persuade her, if in your power; for much I doubt whether her prospects are altogether so good as she has represented them to me. So fine a creature must not be sacrificed.” She lost no time in proceeding to the dwelling and into the chamber of Lucy Munro. She regarded none of the objections of the old lady, the aunt of her she sought, who would have denied her entrance. Edith's was a spirit of the firmest mould—tenacious of its purpose, and influenced by no consideration which would have jostled with the intended good. She approached the sufferer, who lay half conscious only on her couch. Lucy could not be mistaken as to the person of her visiter. The noble features, full of generous beauty and a warm spirit, breathing affection for all human things, and doubly expanded with benevolent sweetness when gazing down upon one needing and deserving of so much—all told her that the beloved and the betrothed of Ralph Colleton was before her. She looked, and sighing deeply, turned her head upon the pillow, so as to shut out a presence so dangerously beautiful. But Edith was a woman whose thoughts, having deeply examined the minute structure of her own heart, could now readily understand that of another, which so nearly resembled it. She perceived the true course for adoption, and bending gently over the despairing girl, she possessed herself of one of her hands, while her lips, with the most playful sweetness of manner, were fastened upon those of the sufferer. The speech of such an action was instantaneous in its effect. “Oh, why are you here—why did you come?” —was the murmured inquiry of the drooping maiden. “To know you—to love you—to win you to love me, Lucy. I would be worthy of your love, dear girl. I know how worthy you are of all of mine. I have heard all.” “No—no! not all—not all—or you never would be here.” Vol. II.—C c “I have heard much, Lucy, but know more, and I love you the better because you love him.” A deep sigh burst from the lips of the maiden, while her face was again averted. “Yes, Lucy—the woman has discovered more than the man, and wonder not, therefore, that Edith Colleton knows more than her lover ever dreamed of. I know all, my Lucy—Ralph's sister and mine—and you must learn to love me for his sake. I have come to win your love. I have come to ask—to beg—to implore you, for him, not less than for myself. You know not how he suffers from your denial. He had given a solemn pledge, which your refusal has defeated. He thinks you offended with him—he feels deeply the debt you have conferred upon us all, and while his feelings of affection—affection as true and more tender than that of a brother—prompt the same thing, those of gratitude are no less strong and urgent in the desire that you will accept his offer —my offer, for, indeed, dear Lucy, it is mine. But I have another argument beyond all these. He fears that a want of confidence in him, or a more delicate scruple yet, or indifference, or some other cause, inimical to his pride and character, prompts you in all this. My reason for the entreaty is founded on a persuasion the reverse of his. I know the true cause, and feel, that, but for me and the feeling in your bosom which neither of us may name, his proffer must have been accepted. It is for this very reason that I come to solicit. I would not that another should think as I have thought, and hence I would have you, Lucy, dwell with me as Ralph's sister and mine. Fear not that I shall give up your secret—come with me and be secure.” The manner of Edith was well calculated to enforce her object—never was the tender and affectionate solicitude of a sister better exhibited, and in sweeter colours, than by her on this occasion. As she spoke, her arms were gently folded around the form of the maiden she addressed; and at one point of time, as Lucy was manifesting a disposition to rise and procure a cup of water that stood on an adjacent table—“You are sick and faint, Lucy, and I will get it for you—it is thus, when we live together, that we shall serve one another. We shall indeed be sisters—” was her ready remark, as, gently pressing her down again upon the couch, she rose hastily and procured it. All that she had said and done in this brief interview had been full of effect, and the fluctuations of Lucy's countenance during its progress would have afforded a fine study for the dramatic painter. She had conquered. Feebly, at the conclusion of a dialogue much longer protracted, she signified her assent. “Brother—brother and sister. That is much, very much for one like me—one so desolate. It is better too. Do with me then, dear sister, as you please.” “Now, indeed, Lucy, is Edith happy, and Ralph too—” “Speak not of him now—not of him—and oh, Edith, my sister, remember—my life, my heart— all, all are in your hands.” “The trust is to a sister—it is sacred—may she lose the affection which she most values when it is forgotten!” And the lips of the sisters met, and their arms were linked together in the most affectionate confidence, while the spirits of Lucy, if not more buoyant and elastic, were at least something more composed than before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. “When Nero perish'd by the justest doom Which ever the destroyer yet destroy'd, Some hands unseen strewed flow'rs upon his tomb.” Byron. There was no little stir in the village of Chestatee on the morning following that in which the scene narrated in the preceding chapter had taken place. It so happened that several of the worthy villagers had determined to remove upon that day; and Colonel Colleton and his family, consisting of his daughter, Lucy Munro, and his future son-in-law, having now no further reason for delay, had also chosen it as their day of departure for Carolina. Nor did the already named constitute the sum total of the cavalcade setting out for that region. Carolina was about to receive an accession in the person of the sagacious pedler, Bunce, who, in a previous conversation with both Colonel Colleton and Ralph, had made arrangements for future and large adventures in the way of trade—having determined, with the advice and assistance of his newly-acquired friends, to establish one of those wonders of various combination, called a country store, among the good people of Sumter District. Under their direction, and hopeful of the Colleton patronage and influence, Bunce never troubled himself to dream of unprofitable speculations; but immediately drawing up letters for his brother and some other of his kinsmen engaged in the manufacture, at Meriden and Berlin, of one kind of notion or other, he detailed his new designs, and furnished liberal orders for the articles required and deemed necessary for the wants of the free-handed backwoodsmen of the south. Lest our readers should lack any information on the subject and touching the nature of these wants, we shall narrate a brief dialogue between the younger Colleton and our worthy merchant, which took place but a few hours before their departure. “Well, Bunce, are you ready? We shall be off now in a couple of hours or so, and you must not keep us in waiting. Pack up at once, man, and make yourself ready.” “I guess you're in a little bit of a small hurry, Master Colleton, 'cause, you see, you've some reason to be so. You hain't had so easy a spell on it, no how, and I don't wonder as how you're no little airnest to get off. Well—you won't have to wait for me. I've jest got through mending my little go-cart; though, to be sure, it don't look, no how, like the thing it was. The riglators made awful sad work of the box and body, and what with patching and piecing, there's no two eends on it alike.” “Well, you're ready, however, and we shall have no difficulty at the last hour?” “None to speak on. Jared Bunce aint the chap for burning daylight; and whenever you're ready to say `go,' he's gone. But, I say, Master Ralph —there's one little matter I'd like you to look at.” “What's that?—Be quick now, for I've much to see to.” “Only a minute. Here, you see, is a letter I've jest writ to my brother, Ichabod Bunce, down in Meriden. He's a 'cute chap, and quite a Yankee, now, I tell you; and, as I knows all his ways, I've got to keep a sharp look out to see he don't come C c 2 over me. Ah, Master Ralph, it's a hard thing to say one's own flesh and blood aint the thing, but the truth's the truth to be sure, and though it does hurt in the telling, that's no reason it shouldn't be told.” “Certainly not!” “Well, as I say, Ichabod Bunce is as close and 'cute in his dealings as any man in all Connetticut, and that's no little say, I'm sartin. He's got the trick, if anybody's got it, of knowing how to make your pocket his, and squaring all things coming in by double multiplication. If he puts a shilling down, it's sure to stick to another; and if he picks one up, it never comes by itself—there's always sure to be two on 'em.” “A choice faculty for a tradesman.” “How?” “Just the man for business, I take it.” “Jest so—you're right there, Master Colleton— there's no mistake about that. Well, as I tell'd you now, though he's my own brother, I have to keep a raal sharp look out over him in all our dealings. If he says two and two makes four, I sets too to calkilate, for when he says so, I'm sure something's coming not altogether right; and though I knows, when the thing stands by itself, that two and two does make four; yet, somehow, whenever he says it, I begin to think it not altogether so sartain. Ah, he's a main hand for trade, but there's no knowing when he'll come over you.” “But, Bunce, without making morals a party to this question, as you are in copartnership with your brother, you should rather rejoice that he possesses so happy a faculty; it certainly should not be a matter of regret with you.” “Why, how—you wouldn't have me to be a mean-spirited fellow, who would live all for money, and not care how it comes. I can't, sir—'tain't my way, I assure you. I do feel that I wasn't born to live nowhere except in the south, 'cause I feel rather sort-a than not sort-a, with the people there; and so I thought when I wrote Ichabod Bunce my last letter. I told him every man on his own hook, now—for, you see, I couldn't stand his close-fisted contrivances any longer. He wanted me to work round the ring like himself, but I was quite too up--and-down for that, and so I squared off from him soon as I could. We never did agree when we were together, you see—'cause naterally, being brothers and partners, he couldn't shave me as he shaved other folks, and so, 'cause he couldn't by nature and partnership come 'cute over me, he was always grumbling, and for every yard of prints, he'd make out to send two yards of grunt and growls, and that was too much, you know, even for a pedler to stand; so we cut loose, and now as the people say on the 'Hio—every man paddle his own canoe.” “And you are now alone in the way of trade, and this store which you are about to establish is entirely on your own account?” “Guess it is, and so, you see, I must pull with single oar up stream, and shan't quarrel with no friend that helps me now and then to send the boat ahead.” “Rely upon us, Bunce. You have done too much in my behalf to permit any of our family to forget your services. We shall do all that we can towards giving you a fair start in the stream, and it will not be often that you shall require a helping-hand in paddling your canoe.” “I know'd it, Master Colleton—'Taint in Carolina, nor in Georgy, nor Virginny, no—nor down in Alabam, that a man will look long for provisions, and see none come. That's the people for me. I guess I must ha' been born by nature in the south, though I did see daylight in Connetticut.” “Very likely, Bunce—but what paper is that in your hand?” “Oh, that. That's jest what I was going now to ax you about. That's my bill of particulars, you see, that I'm going to send on by the post, to Ichabod Bunce. He'll trade with me, now we're off copartnership, and be as civil as a lawyer jest afore court time. 'Cause, you see, he'll be trying to come over me, and will throw as much dust in my eyes as he can. But I guess he don't catch me with mouth a-jar. I know his tricks, and he'll find me up to them.” “And what is it you require of me in this matter?” “Oh, nothing, but jest to look over this list, and tell me how you 'spose the things will suit your part of the country. You see I must try and larn how to please my customers, that is to be. Now, you see, here's, in the first place—for they're a great article now in the country, and turn out well in the way of sale—here's—” and he proceeded to unfold (dwelling with an emphatic and precise description of each article in turn) the immense inventory of wares and merchandises with which he was about to establish. The assortment was various enough. There were pen-knives, and jack-knives, and clasp-knives, and dirk-knives, horn and wooden combs, calicoes and clocks, and tinware and garden seeds: everything, indeed, without regard to fitness of association, which it was possible to sell in the region to which he was going. Ralph heard him through his list with tolerable patience; but when the pedler, having given it a first reading, proposed a second, with passing comments on the prospects of sale of each separate article, by way of recapitulation, the youth could stand it no longer. Apologizing to the tradesman, therefore, in good set terms, he hurried away to the completion of those preparations called for by his approaching departure. Bunce, having no auditor, was compelled to do the same; and, accordingly, a few hours after, the entire party made its appearance in the court of the village inn, where the carriages stood in waiting, and but few more causes of delay could now be anticipated. About this time another party left the village, though in a different direction. It consisted of old Walton, his wife, and daughter Kate. In their company rode our old friend the lawyer Pippin, who, hopeless now of elevation in his present whereabouts, was solicitous of a fairer field for the exhibition of his powers of law and logic than that which he now left had ever afforded him. He made but a small item in the caravan. His goods and chattels required little compression for the purposes of carriage, and a small Jersey—a light wagon in free use in that section, contained all his wardrobe, books, papers, &amp;c.—the heirlooms of a long and carefully chronicled genealogy. We may not particularize his fortunes after his removal to the valley of the Mississippi. It does not belong to the narrative; but, we may surely say, to those in whom his appearance may have provoked some interest, that subsequently he got into fine practice—was notorious for his stump speeches, and a random sheet of the “Republican Star and Banner of Independence” which we now have before us, published in the town of “Modern Ilium,” under the head of the “Triumph of Liberty and Principle,” records in the most glowing language the elevation of Peter Pippin, Esq., to the State Legislature, by seven votes majority over Colonel Hannibal Hopkins, the military candidate— Pippin 39, Hopkins 32. Such a fortunate result, if we have rightly estimated the character of the man, will have easily slaved over all the hurts which, in his earlier history, his self-love may have suffered. But the hour of departure was at hand, and assisting the fair Edith into the carriage, Ralph had the satisfaction of placing her beside the sweetly sad, the lovely, but still deeply suffering girl, to whom he owed so much in the preservation of his life; but who herself had fallen a victim to the very interest which had inspired her to save him. She was silent when he spoke, but she looked her replies, and he felt that they were sufficiently expressive. The old lady had been easily persuaded to go with her niece, and we find her seated accordingly along with Colonel Colleton in the same carriage with the young ladies. Ralph rode, as his humour prompted, sometimes on horse-back, and sometimes in a light gig—a practice adopted with little difficulty, where a sufficient number of servants enabled him to transfer the trust of one or the other conveyance to the liveried outriders who attended. Then came the compact, boxy, buggy, buttoned-up vehicle of our friend the pedler—a thing for which the unfertile character of our language, as yet, has failed to provide a fitting name—but which the backwoodsman of the west calls a go-cart; a title which the proprietor does not always esteem as significant of its manifold virtues and accommodations. With a capacious stomach, it is wisely estimated for all possible purposes; and when opened with a mysterious but highly becoming solemnity, before the gaping and wondering woodsman, how “awful neat” is the arrangement—how various and costly are its treasures, of tape and toys, cottons and calicoes, yarn and buttons, spotted silks and hose—knives and thimbles—scissors and needles— wooden clocks, and coffee-mills, &amp;c.—not to specify a closely packed and various assortment of tinware and japan, from the teakettle and coffee-pot to the drinking mug for the pet boy and the shotted rattle for the infant. A judicious distribution of the two latter, in the way of presents to the young, and the worthy pedler drives a fine bargain with the parents on the strength of it. The party was now fairly ready, but just at the moment of departure who should appear in sight but our simple friend, Chub Williams. He had never been a frequent visiter to the abodes of men, and of course all things occasioned wonder. He seemed fallen upon some strange planet, and was only won to attention by the travellers, on hearing the voice of Lucy Munro calling to him from the carriage window. He could not be made to understand the meaning of her words when she told him where she was going, but contented himself with saying he would come for her, as soon as they built up his house, to be his mother. It was for this purpose he had come to the village, from which, though surprised at all things he saw, he was anxious to get away. He had been promised, as we remember, the rebuilding of his cabin, by the men who captured Rivers; together with sundry other little acquisitions, which, as they were associated with his animal wants, the memory of the urchin did not suffer to escape him. Ralph placed in his hands a sum of money, trifling in itself, but larger in amount than Chub had ever seen at any one time before; and telling him it was all his own, rejoined the party which had already driven off. The pedler still lingered, until a bend in the road put his company out of sight; when, driving up to the idiot, who stood with open mouth wondering at his own wealth, he opened upon him the preliminaries of trade, with a respectful address, duly proportioned to the increased finances of the boy. “I say, now, Chub—seeing you have the raal grit, if it aint axing too much, what do you think to do with all that money? I guess you'd like to lay out a little on't in the way of trade; and as I aint particular where I sell, why, the sooner I begin, I guess, the better. You aint in want of nothing, eh? No knife to cut the saplings, and pare the nails, nor nothing of no kind?—Now I has every thing from—” Bunce would have gone on narrating, as we have already heard them, in detail, the name of every commodity in his wagon, but, at this stage of his speech, one of the outriders returned under the orders of Master Ralph, to see what delayed the worthy trafficker, and to render assistance if any were needed. The blacky, who was no other than our old friend Cæsar, was urgent —for the profession of peddling wins as little respect from the southern slave as from the southern freeman—and did not hesitate to declaim against the burning shame of the attempt of Mr. Bunce to wheedle the poor boy out of the money “Mass Ralph been gib 'em.” The pedler was rebuked; and closing his box, the cover of which he had temptingly thrown open to the stupid admiration of Chub, he hastily followed the direction of the servant, and bidding the now moneyed, and, therefore respectable, idiot a hearty good-bye, he drove off after his fellow wayfarers, with a free rein for Carolina; his head filled with all the fancies, and many a fine vision, of trade, which, after a certain period of life, when the sons and daughters of his young patron had grown into patrons too, he was happy enough, on a moderate scale, to realize. Let us now give our attention to another person of our narrative. Let us go to the dungeon of Guy Rivers, and behold him in a situation so entirely new to him. What a fine mind was here ruined, and how melancholy the contemplation. Well is it for mankind, that, under the distribution of a liberal providence, when the bright stars fall from their places, there is no dark void corresponding in degree with the splendours which have been taken away. Happy for humanity, that, in the eternal progress of change, the nature which is its aliment no less than its element, restores not less than its destiny removes. Yet, the knowledge that we lose not, does not materially lessen the pang when we behold the mighty fall—when we see the great mind, which, as a star, we have almost worshipped, shooting with headlong precipitance through the immense void from its place of eminence, and defrauding the eye of all the glorious presence and golden promise which had become associated with its survey. The intellect of Guy Rivers had been gigantic—the mistake—a mistake quite too common to society —consisted in an education limited entirely to the mind, and entirely neglectful of the morale of the boy. He was taught, like thousands of others; and the standards set up for his moral government, for his passions, for his emotions, were all false from the first. The capacities of his mind were good—they were great—but they had been restrained, while the passions had all been brought Vol. II.—D d into active, and at length ungovernable exercise. How was it possible that reason, thus taught to be subordinate, could hold the strife long, when passion—fierce passion—the passion of the querulous infant, and the peevish boy, bribed to its duty by the toy and the sugar-plum—was its uncompromising antagonist. But let us visit him in his dungeon—the dungeon so lately the abode of his originally destined, but now happily safe, victim. What philosophy is there to support him in his reverse—what consolation of faith, of reflection, or of a due performance of human duties. None! Every thought— every feeling—every dream was merged in one word of appalling terror, and he heard muttered for ever in his senses,—despair, despair, and die! He heard and felt the truth of the warning. There was no hope left—no sunlight came into his dungeon, and the difference in his strength and that of Ralph Colleton would have been perceptible in this single particular. The sun-glance through the barred lattice, suddenly stealing, like a friendly messenger, with a sweet and mellow smile upon his lips, was so hailed by the enthusiastic nature of the one, without guile in his own heart—Rivers would have regarded such a visiter as an intruder, the smile in his eyes would have been a sneer, and he would have turned away from it in disgust. The mind of the strong man is the medium through which the eyes see, and from which life takes all its colour. The heart is the prismatic conductor, through which the affections show, and that which is seared, or steeled or ossified—perverted utterly from its original make—can exhibit no rainbows—no arches of a sweet promise, linking the gloomy earth with the bright and the beautiful and the eternal heavens. The mind of Guy Rivers had been one of the strongest make—one of large and leading tendencies. He could not have been one of the mere numerals of society. He must have been something, or he must have perished. His spirit would have fed upon his heart otherwise, and, wanting a field and due employment, his frame must have been worn away in the morbid repinings of its governing principle. Unhappily, he had not been permitted a choice. The education of his youth had given a fatal direction to his manhood—and we find him accordingly, not satisfied with his pursuit, yet resolutely inflexible and undeviating in the pursuit of error. Such are the contradictions of the strong mind, to which, wondering as we gaze, with unreasonable and unthinking astonishment, we daily see it subject. Our philosophers are content with declaiming upon effects—they will not permit themselves or others to trace them up to their causes. —To heal the wound, the physician may probe and find out its depth and extent—the same privilege is not often conceded to the physician of the mind or of the morals, else numberless diseases, now seemingly incurable, had been long since brought within the healing scope of philosophical analysis. The popular cant would have us forbear even to look at the history of the criminal. Hang the wretch, say they, but say nothing about him. Why trace his progress?—what good can come out of the knowledge of those influences and tendencies, which have made him a criminal? Let them answer the question for themselves! The outlaw beheld the departing cavalcade from the grated window. He saw the last of all those in whose fortunes he might be supposed to have an interest. He turned from the sight with a bitter pang at his heart, and to his surprise, discovered that he was not alone in the solitude of his prison. One ministering spirit sat before him upon the long bench, the only article of furniture afforded to his dungeon. The reader has not forgotten the young woman to whose relief, from fire, Ralph Colleton so opportunely came while making his escape from his pursuers. We remember the resignation—the yielding weakness of her broken spirit to the will of her destroyer. We have seen her left desolate by the death of her only relative, and only not utterly discarded by him, to whose fatal influence over her heart at an earlier period we may ascribe all her desolation. She then yielded without a struggle to his will, and having prepared her a new abiding-place, he had not seen her after, until, unannounced and utterly unlooked-for —certainly uninvited—she appeared before him in the cell of his dungeon. Certainly, none are utterly forgotten! There are some who remember —some who feel with the sufferer, however lowly in his suffering—some who cannot forget. No one perishes without a tearful memory becoming active when informed of his fate; and though the world scorns and despises, some one heart keeps a warm sympathy, that gives a sigh over the ruin, and perhaps plants a flower upon its grave. Rivers had not surely looked for the forsaken and the defrauded girl, for whom he had shown so little love. He knew not at first how to receive her. What offices could she do for him—what influence exercise—how lighten the burden of his doom—how release him from his chains? Nothing of this could she perform, and what did she there? For sympathy, at such a moment, he cared little— for such sympathy, at least, as he could command. His pride and ambition, heretofore, had led him to despise and undervalue the easy of attainment. He was always grasping after the impossible. The fame which he had lost for ever grew doubly attractive to his mind's eye from the knowledge of this fact. The society, which had expelled him from its circle and its privileges, was an Eden in his imagination, simply on that account. The love of Edith Colleton grew more desirable from her scorn;—and the defeat of hopes so daring, made his fierce spirit writhe within him, in all the pangs of disappointment, only neutralized by his hope of revenge. And that hope was now gone—the dungeon and the doom were all that met his eyes; and what had she to do in his prison-cell and with his prison feelings, whom Providence, even in her own despite, was now about to avenge. No wonder he turned away from her in the bitterness of the thought which her appearance must necessarily have inspired. “Turn not away—speak to me, Guy—speak to me if you have pity in your soul. You shall not drive me from you—you shall not dismiss me now. I should have obeyed you at another time, though you had sent me to my death—but I cannot obey you now. I am strong now, strong—very strong since I can say so much. I am come to be with you to the last, and, if it be possible, to die with you; and you shall not refuse me. You shall not —oh, you will not—you cannot—” And as she spoke, she clung to him as one pleading herself for life to the unrelenting executioner. He replied, in a sarcasm, true to his general course of life. “Yes, Ellen—your revenge for your wrongs would not be well complete, unless your own eyes witnessed it; and you insist upon the privilege as if you duly estimated the luxury. Well!—you may stay. It needed but this, if any D d 2 thing had been needed, to show me my own impotence.” “Cruel to the last, Guy—cruel to the last. Surely the few hours between this and that of death, are too precious to be employed in bitterness. Were not prayer better—if you will not pray, Guy, let me. My prayer shall be for you; and in the forgiveness which my heart shall truly send to my lips for the wrongs you have done me and mine, I shall not altogether despair, so that you join with me, of winning a forgiveness far more important and precious. Guy—will you join with me in prayer?” “My knees are stiff, Ellen. I have not been taught to kneel.” “But it is not too late to learn.—Bend, bow with me, Guy—if you have ever loved the poor Ellen, bow with her now. It is her prayer; and oh, think, how weak is the vanity of this pride in a situation like yours. How idle the stern and stubborn spirit, when men can place you in bonds, —when men can take away life and name—when men can hoot and hiss and defile your fettered and enfeebled person. It was for a season and a trial like this, Guy, that humility was given us. It was in order to such an example that the Saviour died for us.” “He died not for me. I have gained nothing by his death. Men are as bad as ever, and wrong— the wrong which deprived me of my right in society—has been as active and prevailing a principle of human action as before he died. It is in his name now that they do the wrong, and in his name, since his death, they have contrived to find a sanction for all manner of crime. Speak no more of this, Ellen; you know nothing about it. It is all folly.” “To you, Guy, it may be. To the wise all things are folly. But to the humble heart there is a word even in what are thought follies which brings us the best of teachings. That is no folly which keeps down, in the even posture of humility, the spirit which circumstances would only bind and crush in every effort to rise. That is no folly which prepares us for reverses, and fortifies us against change and vicissitude. That is no folly which takes away the sting from affliction—which has kept me, Guy, as once before you said, from driving a knife into your heart, while it lay beating against the one to which yours had brought all manner of affliction. Oh, believe me, the faith and the feeling and the hope, not less than the fear, which has made me what I am now—which has taught me to rely only on the one—which has made me independent of all things and all loves,—ay, even of yours, when I refer to it—is no idle folly. It is the only medicine by which the heart may live. It is that which I bring to you now. Hear me then, Guy— hear the prayer of the poor Ellen, who surely has some right to be heard by you. Kneel for me, and with me, on this dungeon floor, and pray—only pray.” “And what should I pray for, and what should I say—and whom should I curse?” “Oh, curse none—say any thing you please, so that it have the form of a prayer. Say, though but a single sentence, but say it in the spirit which is right.” “Say what?” “Say—the Lord's will be done—if nothing more; but say it in the true feeling—the feeling of humble reliance upon God.” “And wherefore say this? His will must be done, and will be done, whether I say it or not. This is all idle—very idle,—and to my mind excessively ridiculous, Ellen.” “Not so, Guy, as your own sense will inform you. True, his will must be done, but there is a vast difference between desiring that it be done, and in endeavouring to resist its doing. It is one thing to pray that his will have its way without stop, but quite another to have a vain wish in one's heart to arrest its progress. But I am a poor scholar, and have no words to prove this to your mind if you are not willing to think upon the subject. If the danger is not great enough in your thought—if the happiness of that hope of immortality be not sufficiently impressive to you—how can I make it seem different. The great misfortune of the learned and the wise is, that they will not regard the necessity. If they did—if they could be less self-confident, how much more readily would all these lights from God shine out to them, than to us who want the far sense so quickly to perceive and to trace them out in the thick darkness. But it is my prayer, Guy, that you kneel with me in prayer; that you implore the feeling of preparedness for all chances which can only come from Heaven. Do this for me, Guy—Guy, my beloved—the destroyer of my youth, of all my hope, and of all of mine, making me the poor destitute and outcast that you find me now—do this one, one small service for the Ellen you have so much wronged, and she forgives you all. I have no other prayer than this—I have no other wish in life.” As she spoke she threw herself before him and clasped his knees firmly with her hands. He lifted her gently from the floor, and for a few moments maintained her in silence in his arms. At length, releasing her from his grasp, and placing her upon the bench, on which, until that moment, he had continued to sit, he replied:— “The prayer is small—very small, Ellen—which you make, and I know no good reason why I should not grant it. I have been to you all that you describe me. You have called me truly your destroyer, and the forgiveness you promise in return for this prayer is desirable even to one so callous as myself. I will do as you require.” “Oh, will you? then I shall be so happy—” was her exclamation of rejoicing. He replied gravely— “We shall see. I will, Ellen, do you as you require, but you must turn away your eyes—go to the window and look out. I would not be seen in such a position, nor while uttering such a prayer.” “Oh, be not ashamed, Guy Rivers. Give over that false sentiment of pride which is now a weakness. Be the man, the—” “Be content, Ellen, with my terms. Either as I please, or not at all. Go to the window.” She did as he directed, and a few moments had elapsed only when he called her to him. He had resumed his seat upon the bench, and his features were singularly composed and quiet. “I have done something more than you required, Ellen, for which you will also have to forgive me. Give me your hand, now.” She did so, and he placed it upon his bosom, which was now streaming with his blood. He had taken the momentary opportunity afforded him by her absence at the window to stab himself to the heart with a penknife which he had contrived to conceal upon his person. Horror-struck, the affrighted woman would have called out for assistance, but he sternly stayed her speech and action. “Not for your life, Ellen—not for your life. It is all useless. I first carefully felt for the beatings of my heart, and then struck where they were strongest. The stream flows now which will soon cease to flow, and but one thing can stop it.” “Oh, what is that, Guy—let me—” “Death,—which is at hand! Now, Ellen, do you forgive me? I ask no forgiveness from others.” “From my heart I do, believe me.” “It is well. I am weak. Let me place my head upon your bosom. It is some time, Ellen, since it has been there. How wildly does it struggle. Pray, Ellen, that it beat not long. It has a sad office! Now—lips—give me your lips, Ellen. You have forgiven me—all—every thing?” “All, all!” “It grows dark—but I care not. Yet, throw open the window—I will not rest—I will pursue. He shall not escape me—Edith—Edith!” He was silent—in the last moment his mind had wandered to the scene, in which, but a few hours before, he had witnessed the departure of Edith with his rival, Colleton. The jailer, alarmed by the first fearful cry of Ellen succeeding this event, rushed with his assistants into the cell, but too late. The spirit had departed; and they found but the now silent mourner, with folded arms, and a countenance that had in it volumes of unutterable wo, bending over the inanimate form of one, whose life and misnamed love had been the bane of hers.
