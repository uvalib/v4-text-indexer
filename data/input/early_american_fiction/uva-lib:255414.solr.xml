      <field name="fulltext">A 2 THE DEVIL AND TOM WALKER. A few miles from Boston, in Massachusetts, there is a deep inlet winding several miles into the interior of the country from Charles Bay, and terminating in a thickly wooded swamp, or morass. On one side of this inlet is a beautiful dark grove; on the opposite side the land rises abruptly from the water's edge, into a high ridge, on which grow a few scattered oaks of great age and immense size. It was under one of these gigantic trees, according to old stories, that Kidd the pirate buried his treasure. The inlet allowed a facility to bring the money in a boat secretly, and at night, to the very foot of the hill. The elevation of the place permitted a good look-out to be kept, that no one was at hand—while the remarkable trees formed good landmarks by which the place might easily be found again. The old stories add, moreover, that the devil presided at the hiding of the money, and took it under his guardianship; but this, it is well known, he always does with buried treasure, particularly when it has been ill gotten. Be that as it may, Kidd never returned to recover his wealth—being shortly after seized at Boston, sent out to England, and there hanged for a pirate. About the year 1727, just at the time when earthquakes were prevalent in New-England, and shook many tall sinners down upon their knees, there lived near this place a meagre, miserly fellow of the name of Tom Walker.— He had a wife as miserly as himself; they were so miserly that they even conspired to cheat each other. Whatever the woman could lay hands on she hid away; a hen could not cackle but she was on the alert to secure the new-laid egg. Her husband was continually prying about to detect her secret hoards, and many and fierce were the conflicts that took place about what ought to have been common property. They lived in a forlorn-looking house, that stood alone, and had an air of starvation. A few straggling savine trees, emblems of sterility, grew near it; no smoke ever curled from its chimney; no traveller stopped at its door. A miserable horse, whose ribs were as articulate as the bars of a gridiron, stalked about a field where a thin carpet of moss, scarcely covering the ragged beds of pudding-stone, tantalized and balked his hunger; and sometimes he would lean his head over the fence, look piteously at the passer-by, and seem to petition deliverance from this land of famine. The house and its inmates had altogether a bad name. Tom's wife was a tall termagant, fierce of temper, loud of tongue, and strong of arm. Her voice was often heard in A 3 wordy warfare with her husband; and his face sometimes showed signs that their conflicts were not confined to words. No one ventured, however, to interfere between them: the lonely wayfarer shrunk within himself at the horrid clamor and clapper-clawing—eyed the den of discord askance, and hurried on his way, rejoicing, if a bachelor, in his celibacy. One day that Tom Walker had been to a distant part of the neighborhood, he took what he considered a short cut homewards through the swamp. Like most short cuts, it was an ill-chosen route. The swamp was thickly grown with great gloomy pines and hemlocks—some of them ninety feet high; which made it dark at noon day, and a retreat for all the owls of the neighborhood. It was full of pits and quagmires, partly covered with weeds and mosses; where the green surface often betrayed the traveller into a gulf of black smuthering mud: there were also dark and stagnant pools, the abodes of the tadpole, the bull-frog, and the water-snake, and where trunks of pines and hemlocks lay half drowned, half rotting, looking like alligators sleeping in the mire. Tom had long been picking his way cautiously through this treacherous forest—stepping from tuft to tuft of rushes and roots which afforded precarious footholds among deep sloughs; or pacing carefully, like a cat, along the prostrate trunks of trees—startled now and then by the sudden screaming of the bittern, or the quacking of a wild duck, rising on the wing from some solitary pool. At length he arrived at a piece of firm ground, which ran out like a peninsula into the deep bosom of the swamp. It had been one of the strong holds of the Indians during their wars with the first colonists. Here they had thrown up a kind of fort which they had looked upon as almost impregnable, and had used as a place of refuge for their squaws and children. Nothing remained of the Indian fort but a few embankments gradually sinking to the level of the surrounding earth, and already over-grown in part by oaks and other forest trees, the foliage of which formed a contrast to the dark pines and hemlocks of the swamp. It was late in the dusk of evening that Tom Walker reached the old fort; and he paused there for a while to rest himself. Any one but he would have felt unwilling to linger in this lonely melancholy place—for the common people had a bad opinion of it from the stories handed down from the time of the Indian wars; when it was asserted that the savages held incantations here, and made sacrifices to the evil spirit. Tom Walker, however, was not a man to be troubled with any fears of the kind. He reposed himself for some time on the trunk of a fallen hemlock, listening to the boding cry of the tree-toad, and delving with his walking staff into a mound of black mould at his feet. As he turned up the soil unconsciously, his staff struck against something hard. He raked it out of the vegetable mould, and lo! a cloven skull with an Indian tomahawk buried deep in it, lay before him! The rust on the weapon A 4 showed the time that had elapsed since this death-blow had been given. It was a dreary memento of the fierce struggle that had taken place in this last foothold of the Indian warriors. “Humph!” said Tom Walker, as he gave the skull a kick to shake the dirt from it. “Leave that skull alone!” said a gruff voice. Tom lifted up his eyes, and beheld a great black man, seated directly opposite him on the stump of a tree. He was exceedingly surprised, having neither seen nor heard any one approach, and he was still more perplexed on observing, as well as the gathering gloom would permit, that the stranger was neither negro nor Indian. It is true, he was dressed in a rude, half Indian garb, and had a red belt or sash swathed round his body; but his face was neither black nor copper color, but swarthy and dingy and begrimed with soot, as if he had been accustomed to toil among fires and forges. He had a shock of coarse black hair, that stood out from his head in all directions; and bore an axe on his shoulder. He scowled for a moment at Tom with a pair of great red eyes. “What are you doing in my grounds?” said the black man, with a hoarse growling voice. “Your grounds?” said Tom with a sneer; “no more your grounds than mine—they belong to Deacon Peabody.” “Deacon Peabody be damn'd,” said the stranger, “as I flatter myself he will be, if he does not look more to his own sins and less to his neighbors'. Look yonder, and see how Deacon Peabody is faring.” Tom looked in the direction that the stranger pointed, and beheld one of the great trees, fair and flourishing without, but rotten at the core, and saw that it had been nearly hewn through, so that the first high wind was likely to blow it down. On the bark of the tree was scored the name of Deacon Peabody. He now looked round and found most of the tall trees marked with the name of some great men of the colony, and all more or less scored by the axe. The one on which he had been seated, and which had evidently just been hewn down, bore the name of Crowninshield; and he recollected a mighty rich man of that name, who made a vulgar display of wealth, which it was whispered he had acquired by bucaniering. “He's just ready for burning!” said the black man, with a growl of triumph. “You see I am likely to have a good stock of fire wood for winter.” “But what right have you,” said Tom, “to cut down Deacon Peabody's timber?” “The right of prior claim,” said the other. “This woodland belonged to me long before one of you white-faced Yankee race of rascals put foot upon the soil.” “And pray, who are you, if I may be so bold?” said Tom. “Oh, I go by various names. I am the Wild Huntsman in some countries; the Black Miner in others. In this neighborhood I am known by the name of the Black Woodsman. I am he to whom the red men devoted this spot, and now and then roasted a white man by way of sweet smelling sacrifice. Since the red men have been exterminated by you white savages, I amuse myself by presiding at the persecutions of Quakers and Anabaptists;—I am the great patron and prompter of slave-dealers, and the grand master of the Salem witches.” “The upshot of all which is, that, if I mistake not,” said Tom, sturdily, “you are he commonly called Old Scratch.” “The same at your service!” replied the black man, with a half civil nod. Such was the opening of this interview, according to the old story, though it has almost too familiar an air to be credited. One would think that to meet with such a singular personage in this wild lonely place, would have shaken any man's nerves: but Tom was a hard minded fellow, not easily daunted, and he had lived so long with a termagant wife, that he did not even fear the devil. It is said that after this commencement, they had a long and earnest conversation together, as Tom returned homewards. The black man told him of great sums of money which had been buried by Kidd the pirate, under the oak trees on the high ridge not far from the morass. All these were under his command and protected by his power, so that none could find them but such as propitiated his favor. These he offered to place within Tom Walker's reach, having conceived an especial kindness for him: but they were to be had only on certain conditions. What these conditions were, may easily be surmised, though Tom never disclosed them publicly. They must have been very hard, for he required time to think of them, and he was not a man to stick at trifles where money was in view. When they had reached the edge of the swamp, the stranger paused. “What proof have I that all you have been telling me is true?” said Tom. “There is my signature,” said the black man, pressing his finger on Tom's forehead. So saying, he turned off among the thickets of the swamp, and seemed, as Tom said, to go down, down, down, into the earth, until nothing but his head and shoulders could be seen, and so on, until he totally disappeared. When Tom reached home he found the black print of a finger burnt, as it were, into his forehead, which nothing could obliterate. The first news his wife had to tell him was the sudden death of Absalom Crowninshield, the rich buccanier. It was announced in the papers with the usual flourish, that “a great man had fallen in Israel.” Tom rocollected the tree which his black friend had just hewn down, and which was ready for burning. “Let the freebooter roast,” said Tom, “who cares!” He now felt convinced that all he had heard and seen was no illusion. He was not prone to let his wife into his confidence; but as this was an uneasy secret, he willingly shared it with her. All her avarice was awakened at the mention of hidden gold, and she urged her husband to comply with the black man's terms, and secure what would make them wealthy for life. However Tom might have felt disposed to sell himself to the devil, he was determined not to do so to oblige his wife; so he flatly refused out of the mere spirit of contradiction. Many and bitter were the quarrels they had on the subject; but the more she talked, the more resolute was Tom not to be damned to please her. At length she determined to drive the bargain on her own account, and if she succeeded, to keep all the gain to herself. Being of the same fearless temper as her husband, she sat off for the old Indian fort towards the close of a summer's day. She was many hours absent. When she came back she was reserved and sullen in her replies. She spoke something of a black man whom she had met about twilight, hewing at the root of a tall tree. He was sulky, however, and would not come to terms; she was to go again with a propitiatory offering, but what it was she forebore to say. The next evening she sat off again for the swamp, with her apron heavily laden. Tom waited and waited for her, but in vain: mid-night came, but she did not make her appearance: morning, noon, night returned, but still she did not come. Tom now grew uneasy for her safety; especially as he found she had carried off in her apron the silver tea-pot and spoons, and every portable article of value. Another night elapsed, another morning came; but no wife. In a word, she was never heard of more. What was her real fate nobody knows, in consequence of so many pretending to know. It is one of those facts that have become confounded by a variety of historians. Some assert that she lost her way among the tangled mazes of the swamp, and sunk into some pit or slough; others, more uncharitable, hinted that she had eloped with the household booty, and made off to some other province; while others assert that the tempter had decoyed her into a dismal quagmire, on top of which her hat was found lying. In confirmation of this, it was said a great black man, with an axe on his shoulder, was seen late that very evening coming out of the swamp, carrying a bundle tied in a check apron, with an air of surly triumph. The most current and probable story, however, observes that Tom Walker grew so anxious about the fate of his wife and his property, that he sat out at length to seek them both at the Indian fort. During a long summer's afternoon, he searched about the gloomy place, but no wife was to be seen. He called her name repeatedly, but she was no where to be heard. The bittern alone responded to his voice, as he flew screaming by; or the bull-frog croaked dolefully from a neighboring pool. At length, it is said, just in the brown hour of twilight, when the owls began to hoot and the bats to flit about, his attention was attracted by the clamor of carrion crows that were hovering about a cypress tree. He looked and beheld a bundle tied in a check apron and hanging in the branches of the tree, with a great vulture perched hard by, as if keeping watch upon it. He leaped with joy, for he recognized his wife's apron, and supposed it to contain the household valuables. “Let us get hold of the property,” said he, consolingly to himself, “and we will endeavor to do without the woman.” As he scrambled up the tree the vulture spread its wide wings, and sailed off screaming into the deep shadows of the forest. Tom seized the check apron, but, woful sight! found nothing but a heart and liver tied up in it. Such, according to the most authentic old story, was all that was to be found of Tom's wife. She had probably attempted to deal with the black man as she had been accustomed to deal with her husband; but though a female scold is generally considered a match for the devil, yet in this instance she appears to have had the worst of it. She must have died game however, from the part that remained unconquered. Indeed, it is said Tom noticed many prints of cloven feet deeply stamped about the tree, and several handsful of hair, that looked as if they had been plucked from the coarse black shock of the woodsman. Tom knew his wife's prowess by experience. He shrugged his shoulders as he looked at the signs of a fierce clapper-clawing. “Egad,” said he to himself, “Old Scratch must have had a tough time of it!” Tom consoled himself for the loss of his property by the loss of his wife; for he was a little of a philosopher. He even felt something like gratitude towards the black woodsman, who he considered had done him a kindness. He sought, therefore, to cultivate a farther acquaintance with him, but for some time without success: the old black legs played shy, for whatever people may think, he is not always to be had for calling for; he knows how to play his cards when pretty sure of his game. At length, it is said, when delay had whetted Tom's eagerness to the quick, and prepared him to agree to any thing rather than not gain the promised treasure, he met the black man one evening in his usual woodman dress, with his axe on his shoulder, sauntering along the edge of the swamp, and humming a tune. He affected to receive Tom's advance with great indifference, made brief replies, and went on humming his tune. By degrees, however, Tom brought him to business, and they began to haggle about the terms on which the former was to have the pirate's treasure. There was one condition which need not be mentioned, being generally understood in all cases where the devil grants favors; but there were others about which, though of less importance, he was inflexibly obstinate. He insisted that the money found through his means should be employed in his service. He proposed, therefore, that Tom should employ it in the black traffic; that is to say, that he should fit out a slave ship. This, however, Tom resolutely refused: he was bad enough in all conscience; but the devil himself could not tempt him to turn slave-dealer. Finding Tom so squeamish on this point, he did not insist upon it; but proposed instead, that he should turn usurer—the devil being extremely anxious for the increase of usurers, looking upon them as his peculiar people. To this no objections were made, for it was just to Tom's taste. “You shall open a broker's shop in Boston next month,” said the black man. `I'll do it to-morrow, if you wish,' said Tom. “You shall lend money at 2 per ct. a month.” `Egad, I'll charge four!' replied Tom Walker. “You shall extort bonds, foreclose mortgages, drive the merchant to bankruptcy—” `I'll drive him to the devil,' cried Tom, eagerly. “You are the usurer for my money!” said the black legs, with delight. “When will you want the rhine?” `This very night.' “Done!” said the devil. `Done!' said Tom Walker.—So they shook hands, and struck a bargain. A few days' time saw Tom Walker seated behind his desk in a counting-house in Boston. His reputation for a ready moneyed man, who would lend money out for a good consideration, soon spread abroad. Every body remembers the days of Governor Belcher, when money was particularly scarce. It was a time of paper credit. The country had been deluged with government bills—the famous Land Bank had been established—there had been a rage for speculating—the people had run mad with schemes for new settlements, and for building cities in the wilderness—land-jobbers went about with maps of grants, and townships, and eldorados, lying nobody knew where, but which every body was ready to purchase. In a word, the great speculating fever which breaks out every now and then in the country, had raged to an alarming degree, and every body was dreaming of making sudden fortunes from nothing. As usual, the fever had subsided—the dream had gone off, and the imaginary fortunes with it—the patients were left in doleful plight, and the whole country resounded with the consequent cry of `hard times.' At this propitious time of public distress did Tom Walker set up as a usurer in Boston. His door was soon thronged by customers. The needy and the adventurous—the gambling speculator—the dreaming land-jobber—the thriftless tradesman—the merchant with cracked credit....in short, every one driven to raise money by desperate means and desperate sacrifices, hurried to Tom Walker.—Thus Tom was the universal friend of the needy, and he acted like “a friend in need,”—that is to say, he always exacted good pay and good security. In proportion to the distress of the applicant was the hardness of his terms. He accumulated bonds and mortgages—gradually squeezed his customers closer and closer, and sent them at length dry as a sponge from his door. In this way he made money hand over hand— became a rich and mighty man, and exalted his cocked hat upon change. He built himself a vast house out of ostentation, but left the greater part of it unfinished and unfurnished out of parsimony. He even set up a carriage in the fulness of his vain-glory, though he nearly starved the horses which drew it; and as the ungreased wheels groaned and screeched on the exle-trees, you would have thought you heard the souls of the poor debtors he was squeezing. As Tom waxed old howover, he grew thoughtful. B Having secured the good things of this world, he began to feel anxious about those of the next. He thought with regret on the bargain he had made with his black friend, and set his wits to work to cheat him out of the conditions. He became, therefore, all of a sudden, a violent church-goer. He prayed loudly and strenuously, as if heaven were to be taken by force of lungs. Indeed, one might always tell when he had sinned most during the week, by the clamor of his Sunday devotion. The quiet christians who had been modestly and steadfastly travelling Zionward, were struck with self-reproach at seeing themselves so suddenly out-stripped in their career by this new-made convert. Tom was as rigid in religious, as in money matters; he was a stern supervisor and censurer of his neighbors, and seemed to think every sin entered up to their account became a credit on his own side of the page. He even talked of the expediency of reviving the persecution of Quakers and Anabaptists. In a word, Tom's zeal became as notorious as his riches. Still, in spite of all this strenuous attention to forms, Tom had a lurking dread that the devile after all, would have his due. That he might not be taken unawares, therefore, it is said he always carried a small Bible in his coat pocket. He had also a great folio Bible on his counting-house desk, and would frequently be found reading it when people called on business: on such occasions he would lay his green spectacles on the book, to mark the place, while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain. Some say that Tom grew a little crack-brained in his old days, and that fancying his end approaching, he had his horse new-shod, saddled and bridled, and buried with his feet uppermost; because he supposed that at the last day the world would be turned upside down—in which case he should find his horse standing ready for mounting, and he was determined at the worst to give his old friend a run for it. This, however, is probably a mere old-wives' fable. If he really did take such a precaution, it was totally superfluous: at least so says the authentic old legend, which closes his story in the following manner: On one hot afternoon in the dog-days, just as a terrible black thundergust was coming up, Tom sat in his counting-house in his white linen cap and India silk morning-gown. He was on the point of foreclosing a mortgage, by which he would complete the ruin of an unlucky land speculator, for whom he had professed the greatest friendship. The poor land-jobber begged him to grant a few months indulgence. Tom had grown testy and irritated, and refused another day. “My family will be ruined and brought upon the parish,” said the land-jobber. `Charity begins at home,' replied Tom; `I must take care of myself in these hard times.' “You have made so much money out of me,” said the speculator. Tom lost his patience and his piety—`The B 2 devil take me,' said he, `if I have made a far-thing!' Just then there were three loud knocks at the street door. He stepped out to see who was there. A black man was holding a black horse which neighed and stamped with impatience. “Tom, you're come for!” said the black fellow, gruffly. Tom shrunk back, but too late. He had left his little Bible at the bottom of his coat pocket, and his big Bible on the desk buried under the mortgage he was about to foreclose.—Never was sinner taken more unawares. The black man whisked him like a child astride the horse, and away he galloped in the midst of a thunder-storm. The clerks stuck their pens behind their ears, and stared after him from the windows. Away went Tom Walker, dashing down the streets; his white cap bobbing up and down; his morning-gown fluttering in the wind, and his steed striking fire out of the pavement at every bound. When the clerks turned to look for the black man, he had disappeared. Tom Walker never returned to foreclose the mortgage. A countryman who lived on the borders of the swamp, reported that in the height of the thunder-gust he had heard a great clattering of hoofs and a howling along the road, and that when he ran to the window he just caught sight of a figure, such as I have described, on a horse that galloped like mad across the fields, over the hills and down into the black hemlock swamp towards the old Indian fort; and that shortly after a thunderbolt fell in that direction, which seemed to set the whole forest in a blaze. The good people of Boston shook their heads and shrugged their shoulders, but had been so much accustomed to witches and goblins and tricks of the devil in all kinds of shapes from the first settlement of the colony, that they were not so much horror-struck as might have been expected. Trustees were appointed to take charge of Tom's effects. There was nothing, however, to administer upon. On searching his coffers, all his bonds and mortgages were found reduced to cinders. In place of gold and silver, his iron chest was filled with chips and shavings: two skeletons lay in his stable instead of his half-starved horses; and the very next day his great house took fire and was burnt to the ground. Such was the end of Tom Walker and his ill-gotten wealth. Let all griping money-brokers lay this story to heart. The truth of it is not to be doubted. The very hole under the oak trees, from whence he dug Kidd's money, is to be seen to this day; and the neighboring swamp and old Indian fort is often haunted in stormy nights by a figure on horseback, in a morning-gown and white cap, which is doubtless the troubled spirit of the usurer. In fact, the story has resolved itself into a proverb, and is the origin of that popular saying, prevalent throughout New-England, of “THE DEVIL AND TOM WALKER.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B 3 DEACON GRUBB AND THE OLD NICK. It was many years ago, somewhere about the time of the Dark Day, or the Comet, or the Great Earthquake, or the Cold Friday, or the Old French War,—one or the other of these distinguished epochs, which serve old chrones and gossips to fix their chronology, that there lived in the town of—blank, in the state of Massachusetts, a shrewd, calculating, demure old codger, known to every body round about as Deacon Grubb. His character will be so well understood by saying that he was a country Deacon, that I shall be excused for not delineating it at full length. Deacon Grubb cultivated a bit of a farm, officiated as Town Clerk, drove something of a trade at auctioneering, manufactured wooden bowls and tin ware, and kept the only grocery shop in the village, where he sold West India Goods “of as good quality, and on as reasonable terms, as could be found in the place.” And of a truth, considering that the Deacon had the monopoly of the trade, he must be allowed to have been somewhat reasonable in his dealing, though his gallon pot had a trick of getting jammed by accident, and his water-pail now and then overset into the rum hogshead. By the exercise of all these occupations—by looking out for the main chance, putting the best foot foremost, snatching at every good bone that was offered, and sticking to the old precept—“Get what you can, and keep what you get,”—the Deacon contrived to lay up what he called an honest penny before he was too old to relish the possession of a comfortable round sum. As times went on, and the Deacon was waxed in wealth, he began to cast about for new means to increase his stores. The more he got the more greedy he became,—a common case with many close-fiisted fellows besides deacons. Among other projects of speculation he cast his eyes upon a certain piece or parcel of land with buildings thereon situated, belonging to Joel Wetherbrain, an odd, incomprehensible sort of a fellow, who was never at home, but let his lands run to waste, and his house fall to ruins. Nobody knew exactly what to make of Joel; whether he was fool or knave, a misanthrope or an enthusiast—religious-mad, or honestly crack-brained in the way of nature; it were difficult to decide the point at this late day, especially as my old aunt (of whom I had this narrative, and who was a person of high reputation for veracity, for she never forgot a particle of a story she heard) was dubious about the matter herself.— However, that was neither here nor there. The B 4 Deacon took it hugely to heart that Joel's tenements should lie thus idle; and he formed a pious resolution to trap Joel's five wits in a bargain for the same, whereby if he could get the estate a good pennyworth, he should turn it to an excellent account in the end, and quiet his conscience by the reflection that he made fruitful one of the waste places of the earth. Though the Deacon had probably heard of a certain command forbidding him to covet his neighbor's house, yet he either thought the precept inapplicable in the case of a house without an inhabitant, or the temptation was too strong to be resisted. As he was one day sharking about the grounds, and admiring the advantages of the situation, the fatness of the soil, and the solidity of the old mansion, which, though a little shabby on the outside from neglect, was sound and compact in frame and substance, he unexpectedly encountered Joel, and in a sly, roundabout way contrived to have the subject touched upon. They made a long haggling piece of work of it, and at last the Deacon consented, although the situation was wretched, the land poor, and the house ready to tumble to pieces, to give Joel about half of what it cost originally. Joel clenched the bargain, and the Deacon went home hugging himself with the thought of having made a great spec. Well, now had the Deacon got his heart's desire.—He quickly set himself to repairing the old house, and putting the fields in order: in a short time the whole was neat and flourishing. The Deacon removed to his new estate: the minister preached a sermon the next Sunday from the text, “The hand of the diligent maketh rich,” and every body thought it the grandest bargain that had been made since the worthy settlers of the town cheated the Indians out of the land, at the expense of three cracked muskets and a pot of red paint. But just as the Deacon had taken comfortable possession of the premises, and Joel Weatherbrain had bidden adieu to the place, there got all at once into circulation the most alarming reports about the estate in question. There were stories of ghosts, goblins, and demons frequenting the place for some wonderful cause that nobody could explain. It was even said that Old Beelzebub himself haunted the house in the shape of a tinware pedlar, and that he appeared every Thanksgiving night at twelve o'clock, rattling up and down the house, and making such a clatter and tantararra as to frighten every body within hearing out of their wits. The Deacon was horrified at these accounts, the more so as he found they were universally believed. How the stories originated, nobody could tell; every one had heard them of somebody else; but there was nothing talked of but Deacon Grubb and the haunted house. It was generally believed that Old Beelzebub had taken up his quarters there, and that it would be difficult work to rout him. The Deacon had over-reached every man in the town, and with all their respect for the talents of the Old Nick, it was thought if the Deacon and the Devil came to close quarters, they would make a tough match of it. It is easy to imagine the tribulation into which the poor man was thrown by cogitating upon this matter. There was no doubt the stories were true, for this was the only manner in which Joel Weatherbrain's neglect of the estate could be accounted for—a matter which he unluckily forgot to question him about at the time of making the bargain. It was now clearly perceived why Joel was so ready to part with it at so low a price, and the Deacon could not avoid fretting himself into a fever, with chagrin at the thought of having been over-reached by such a crack-skull as Joel. Instead of making a great bargain, he found he had bought “a pig in a poke.” However, after having been a few weeks settled in his new residence, his apprehensions began to subside. He took care to nail a horse-shoe upon his barn-door, and another upon the gate in front of the house, and trusting in these sovereign precautions against witchcraft and diablerie of all colors, he made himself tolerably easy, thinking his muniments sufficiently strong to defy Beelzebub and all his tricks; but he soon found out the devil is not so easily got rid of—the more is the pity. One Saturday evening, after the Deacon had shut up his shop, and despatched those little items of business in the grocery line which are most conveniently done with closed doors, he sat down alone in his chimney corner to enjoy a comfortable pipe of tobacco. He continued a long while puffing and cogitating, but whether his thoughts were occupied with the spiritual concerns of the coming day, or were wrapt up in calculations on the profits of the past one, it becomes me not to judge; my old aunt had her opinion upon this point, but I could never get it out of her. It had got to be near midnight, and there was not a soul stirring. A dead silence reigned throughout the mansion, broken by nothing save the ticking of a death watch and a subdued pianissimo sort of grunt which accompanied every aspiration of smoke from the Deacon's lips. The candle had burnt down to the socket, and began to flicker a fitful and uncertain light, and the Deacon was in the midst of a profound reverie, with his eye fixed upon the lower end of a pot-hook which hung down the chimney. All at once he was startled by a strange noise. He looked round,—the room was full of smoke from his tobacco pipe, and the candle in the act to expire: a sudden fear crept over him, as he thought of the stories concerning the house. But there was nothing to be seen. In a few seconds he heard the same noise still louder, and now it seemed to come from the chimney. He poked his head up the chimney and listened, but all was still “It can be nothing,” said he to himself, “but the wind roaring over the top of the chimney.” He sat down again, put another candle in the candlestick, took up a coal with the tongs, and was blowing it, when he heard the same noise come down the chimney again, and presently a hollow, strange sounding voice. In surprise and astonishment he looked up and espied a couple of dim, wavering lights at the top of the chimney, but whether they were a pair of fixed stars or the twinklers of an enormous, he could not tell. Presently they grew larger, and at length, turned whitish and ghastly, like a pair of peeled onions or a couple of eggs in a soap-dish. “Mercy on my sins!” exclaimed he, “what can this mean?” He had no time to answer his own questions, for immediately there came a voice down the chimney, which sounded like a Dutchman bawling through a speaking-trumpet—“Deacon! Deacon!” `What in heaven's name do you want of me?' “Deacon, have you watered the rum?” `Ye-e-e-es,' was the slow and most unwilling reply. “Have you sanded the brown sugar?” `Ye-e-es.' “Said your prayers?” `Yes.' “Then set me a chair.” The Deacon knew not what to make of the ceremony of his new guest who thus honored him with a visit by pitching head foremost down his chimney; but knowing that some gentlemen of fashion are singular in their tastes, and wisely conjecturing that the Old Nick might have his whims as well as the rest of them, he determined to humor him. So setting an arm-chair by the fire-place, and answering that all was ready, down came the mysterious visiter slap into the fire-place, overturning as he landed, a tea-kettle, a coffee-pot, and a pan of stewed apples. The Deacon wished him joy of his safe descent, and expressed an apprehension that he had burnt his knuckles in the hot ashes; but his guest replied very civilly that he might be easy on that score, for he had a hand in such matters too often to mind a little scorching. Then brushing the ashes and soot from his knees and elbows, he sat down in the chair, crossed his legs, gave a long deep-drawn sniff, probably to ascertain whether there was any of his favorite perfume of brimstone to be smelt, turned up the whites of his enormous eyes and gave the Deacon a most ominous and inquisitive scowl, which the Deacon returned by inviting him to smoke a pipe of tobacco. The man of the chimney replied that tobacco did not agree with him—he would smoke a bunch of matches or a roll of brimstone if the time allowed, but as his stay must be short this night, he would not trouble the Deacon to fetch the tinderbox. “Then you come upon business,” replied the Deacon.” `You are right,' said the other. “Then proceed to the matter if you please.” `Not till twelve o'clock,' said the man of brimstone—`not till midnight; and it wants ten minutes of the hour,' casting at the same time a look at the Deacon's wooden clock which he had bought of a Connecticut pedlar, and paid for in damaged Bohea tea. “Oh, ah,” said the Deacon, “if the time does not suit you, I can alter it.”—So going to the clock, and moving forward the minute hand, `I have taken the liberty sometimes,' continued he, “to put back the time on Saturday night, when there was danger of my business crowding over into Sunday, and now I can make up for what has been lost by putting it forward. See there, (said he, as the hands of the clock pointed to twelve,) it is now midnight, let me know your business, I hate to encroach upon the Sabbath, but would not turn away a customer.” At this the gentleman giving a tremedous grin, exclaimed, “Deacon, they have always said you beat the Devil for tricks, and I begin to fear it may turn out so. The truth is, I have come to give you a try.” `At your service, friend Beelzebub,' said the Deacon.—`But I don't understand you.' “Why, Deacon, you must know that this house and this estate are mine.” `Yours! no such thing!' “Yes, they fell to me from their ancient owner, Hector Morterhead, a famous player at chequers, who being engaged once at play, and told he would lose, exclaimed in a passion, `The devil fetch me and all I own if I do not beat.' He lost the game, and I have haunted this house ever since.” `Umph!' ejaculated the Deacon. “Now, Deacon,” continued he, “every man who attempts to occupy this spot, must play a game of chequers with me; if he wins the game, he may remain in peaceable possession; I have beat every one so far; it is now your turn to try.” This was the strangest proposal that the Deacon had ever heard of for deciding a litigated point as to the possession of real estate; but as there was no remedy, he submitted, and producing his chequer-board, they sat down to the trial.— The Deacon was celebrated for his knowledge of the game, and would have puzzled his adversary had he been any other than what he was; but he soon found he must lose.—“It is almost broad day,” said he, “I really cannot play on Sunday; let us put off the rest of the game till another time.” `I am willing,' replied his opponent, `to grant any reasonable accommodation, especially to gentlemen of your degree. Every body will grant that deacons are long-lived.—I wait a long while for them.—I allow you a delay this once.—Next Saturday night I will call again, when the game must be finished.” So saying, he vanished up the chimney. I suppose my readers will imagine that the Deacon's sole object in putting off the game was to delay the completion of it as long as he could;—not so, he only wanted an opportunity of getting ready a trick against his adversary, which came into his head just as he was upon the point of giving up the game. He bethought himself of one of his old tricks, by which he used to play the game slyly of a Sunday. “It will do his business for him,” said the Deacon exultingly, “for altho' fire will not burn his fingers, something else will.” The visiter came according to appointment the next Saturday night, and sat down to play without taking notice that the board was different from that used on the first night. The first move he made, his hand was seized with a trembling; at the next move he lost his king, and at the third all hope of achieving his promised victory had vanished: and at every step his affairs grew more desperate, and finally at the seventh move the Deacon had won the game! The man of brimstone sprang from his seat in a passion, and overturned the chequer-board with a single blow of his fist—when lo! it appeared he had been playing upon the covers of the Deacon's Great Bible! In an instant he went off in a whizz up the chimney, and neither he nor any of his imps ever dared to try their tricks with the Deacon afterwards.</field>
