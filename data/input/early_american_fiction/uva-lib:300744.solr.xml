      <field name="fulltext">NOTE. These “Scenes,” it is thought proper to say, are purely fictitious, with no foundation whatever in historical fact, except where an obvious agreement will be found with the Scriptures. Wherever the story deviates from the straight course of the New Testament record, it is to be taken as imaginary — illustrative merely of the period chosen. For the part assigned to Herod there is a show of authority; and it will be found to conflict with the conjecture of those who, to meet the difficulty presented by Luke, xv. 1, suppose the Tetrarch to have been absent from his dominions during all the early part of our Saviour's ministry, engaged in a war with the King of Arabia. In respect to Scripture antiquities no more has been attempted than not to do them violence. Geographical and Topographical details will be found to agree essentially with the best authorities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 1 JULIAN. Praise to the God of Abraham. The locusts are flown. The land which they found flourishing and verdant as a garden, they have changed to the barrenness of a desert. The cities and the villages, but now so full of people, are become the region of desolation and death. Even the very city and house of God are level with the dust, and the ploughshare has gone over them. And here, upon the hill of Olives, I sit, a living witness of the ruin. By reason of the wonderful compassions of God, which never fail, I am escaped as a bird from the net of the fowler. Yet I take little joy in this. For why should the days of one like me be lengthened out, when the mighty and excellent of the land are cut off? I rather rejoice in this, that the spoiler is gone; the armies of the alien have ceased to devour; and they who are fled, and hidden in caves and dens of the rocks, may come forth again to inhabit the land and build up the waste places. A multitude, which no man could number, have fallen before the edge of the sword, or by famine, and the air is full of the pestilential vapors that steam up from their rotting carcases. But a greater multitude remains; and it may well be that ere many years have passed, they shall fill the land as before, and gathered into one by him who, though long delaying, will come, pay back, and more, the measure they have received. That time will surely come. Even as the Assyrian could not finally destroy, but the hand of the Almighty was put forth, and the city and the temple grew again from their ruins to a greater glory than before, so shall it be now. The Roman triumph shall be short. Messiah shall yet appear; and Jerusalem clothed in her beautiful garments shall sit upon her hills, the joy and crown of the whole earth. But for me, my eyes shall not behold it. Before that day these aged limbs shall rest in the sepulchres of Beth-Harem, and these walls will have fallen and mingled with the common earth. It is not to-morrow, nor the day after, that the kingdom shall come. Impatient Israel will not wait the appointed hour; she will not remember that with the Lord a thousand years are as a day, and a day as a thousand years. She will reign to-day or never. It is her mad haste has drawn upon her this wide destruction. Deceivers, and they who have deceived themselves, fools and wicked men, have led her to the precipice, down which she hath fallen, and now lies, as a potter's vessel, broken in fragments. And I, alas, am not clear in the great transgression. The rage which filled the people was in my heart also. I too gave heed to lying words, and bent my knee before him who, in my darkness, seemed to me as in very truth the King of Israel, and bound myself to his chariot wheels. May he whose compassions are infinite pity and forgive his servant. It is with my soul low in the dust before him, that I turn to the long past, and remember the early errors of my life. And why will ye of Rome press upon me the unwelcome task? My kinsmen might well forego any pleasure they may reap, for the pain that will be my only harvest. Yet not my only harvest. The memory of the days spent where Judith and Onias dwelt will bring with it pleasant thoughts, — if many bitter and self-reproachful also. Happily, of this portion of my life, of which you are chiefly desirous to hear, the record already exists; from which I need but draw in such fragments as shall impart all that I may care to reveal. That record lies before me just as it went forth from my full heart, and was poured into the bosom of that more than woman, — my protecting angel, rather, — Naomi the blessed. As the scenes of my earlier life rise before me out of these leaves, distinct as the outlines of these barren hills, so too does the image of my mother come up out of the obscurity of the past, and stand before me, clear and beautiful to the eye as when clothed in flesh. It was to thee, thou true mother in Israel, that I made myself visible and plain to read as a parchment scroll, and from thee in return received those holy counsels, charged with a divine wisdom, which were a pillar of light to my path; and, had I heeded them, had saved me from every error, as they did from more than I can now remember or recount. Concerning my birth and childhood in Rome, and the years which preceded my departure for the East, it needs not that I speak; for of that part of my life enough is known, and I can take no pleasure in re-perusing it. From the letters and other writings transmitted to me long since by my mother from Rome, I now draw what shall give you a somewhat living picture of those days in Judea, about which you are chiefly desirous to hear. 1*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. I thus addressed my mother, soon after reaching Cæsarea: You who know your son so well will not doubt that I took my departure from Antioch with pain. Nowhere since I passed the gates of Rome have I been entertained with such magnificence. Nowhere have the hours proved themselves so short-lived. After the dulness of Athens, and the worse than dulness of Smyrna, Ephesus, and Rhodes, it was refreshing to witness the noise and stir of the mistress of the East. So frequent were the theatres, baths, and porticos, the shows, the games, the combats of wild beasts, that I felt myself almost in the Elysium of my own Rome. What added, too, as you will believe, to my happiness, was this, that I passed everywhere for a Roman of undoubted Roman blood; or, at least, if my descent were seen, with a civility which seems native to these orientals, the knowledge of it was not betrayed by a word or look. I perceive you to smile at this, as also to utter a few words expressive of a gentle contempt for an unworthy scion of an ancient house. The contempt from you I can bear; but the smile by which you seem to enjoy what you are pleased to term my credulity, I must say and believe is wasted. For, more than once have I been assured by some of my own tribe that, but for a something in my eye, they should not suspect me to be other than a Roman. Neither, my mother, was this flattery; it was from some incapable of that meanest vice; from my real friends. But whoever were so blind as to take me for a Roman, you may be assured I was not careful to undeceive them. I enjoyed the perfect felicity while I might. And the dream was undisturbed during the whole of my sojourn there, except in a single instance, when once as I was walking in front of the baths of Tiberius, I saw approaching from an opposite point the lordly Drusus, who, as I gave signs of saluting him, turned his face in another direction, and swept along without recognising me. What think you of that? at this distance I can see your color change. But if you even feel the insult, who live so shut out from the great world, how much more must I who am in it. I think your censure is too sharp upon me, when at such moments I, somewhat hastily perhaps, wish the twelve tribes had found the fate of Pharaoh, seeing that to little else than scorn and curses, hatred and oppression, are they born who come of their lineage. Willingly would I renounce all the wisdom I have ever found in Moses and the prophets, for a little of that equal honor in the eyes of men, which more methinks than questions of philosophy or religion concerns a man's well-being. My eye is not far reaching enough to discern a single advantage in the position the Jew fills in this great theatre of life. He cherishes in his soul his faith, which he holds to be nobler and purer than that of Pythagoras or Cicero. But however much nobler and purer in his own eye, when did other than a Jew so esteem it? Who ever has heard of Romans, Greeks, or Egyptians becoming Jews, and receiving — save in numbers most inconsiderable — the Jewish faith? Yet is it likely that through so many ages a religion given of God should have remained in the world, and not have convinced men of its divinity? I, alas, have not even a conviction of its truth to sustain me under this burden of contempt and reproach. I am a Jew outwardly, carrying the signs of my descent and origin in my face and form, branded in by the Hand that made me, and by the hand that reared me, and this I cannot help. But with readiness would I lose one half my limbs, if from what remained these scars and seams of ignominy were fairly erased. You say that in Rome I mix freely with the Roman youth, that I sit at their tables and they at mine, that I join them at the games, and in every amusement of our city life. It is true; yet still I am a Jew. I am beloved of many because I am Julian; yet by the very same am I abhorred because I am a Jew. The Roman beggar who takes my gold, — for gold is gold, — begs pardon of the gods, and as he turns the corner scours the coin upon the sand. Yet, my mother, I see not why one people should thus proscribe another; nor do I look upon the wrong but with indignation. You justly accuse me with indifference to the religion of my fathers. But I have never beheld with patience the slights, insults, and oppressions which, by the stronger, have been heaped upon the weaker; nor, truly, when I reflect, can I see why the worship of a people should be charged upon them as a crime. It is these injuries which have roused within me, at times, the Jew — however for the most part in my search after pleasure, I have been too ready to forget all but what ministered directly to that end. If thou art filled with wonder at so serious a vein in me, I will soon give thee the reasons thereof; but let me first speak of my passage hither, and of that which happened immediately on my arrival. I left Antioch, as I have said, with regret. At the mouth of the Orontes I embarked in a trader, bound to Cæsarea, and then to Joppa and Alexandria. We at first were driven out to sea by an east wind, and ran quite along the shores of Cyprus; but this soon subsiding, we crossed over again to the Syrian coast, and were afterwards enabled to keep our vessel so near, — the breezes being gentle and from a safe quarter, — that I enjoyed a continued prospect of the country, with as much distinctness and satisfaction, methinks, as if I had been travelling by land; at least with distinctness enough, for every pleasure of this sort is increased by a certain degree of obscurity and dimness. Painters understand this, and over their works throw a sort of haze by some mysterious process of their divine art, which imparts to them their principal charm. No prospect and no picture is beautiful which is clear and sharp as if cut in metal. Truth itself is to me improved by a veil of this same mistiness thrown around it. But if any fault is to be found with this Syrian atmosphere, it is that of this all-involving dimness there is something too much, to that degree, indeed, that the eye is often cheated of the distant features of the landscape, — the mountains which, drawn upon the chart defore us, we know to be not far distant, not too far for the eye to reach with ease, being cut off entirely by this purple wall of partition. Happily, as we drew near the port of Berytus, beyond which lay the mountains of the Libanus and Anti-Libanus, there was not so much of the quality of which I speak in the air, as to deprive us of a view of their summits, crowned with their snowy caps, filling the whole eastern horizon. It was a magnificent mountain scene, a fitting vestibule, you will say, my mother, through which to enter the holy land of Moses and Abraham. It was, I am obliged to confess, with emotions such as I had never experienced before, that I found myself now for the first time gazing upon the shores of this wonderful people, the home of my fathers. It was beautiful to the eye, as we skirted the coast, as one long continued garden. The rich agriculture of the husbandman was pushed out to the very sands of the sea-beach, and every cape, and promontory, and lofty peak, showed, sparkling in the sun, the white walls of a village or some insulated dwelling, proving how thickly peopled must be the country, which could spare its inhabitants for the cultivation of spots naturally barren and inhospitable, but now by the hand of industry changed to a soil not less fertile than that of Italy. I could not but wish that, if it were decreed I must be a Jew, I had been born and had lived in these sunny regions; and in truth, that it had pleased heaven to have retained my parents on their native soil, seeing that there, among our own hills and plains, we could not but have been a people more respected than we now are, or ever can be, wandering over the earth, forcing ourselves upon every nation and every city, unwelcome guests, — among them but never of them. We had not long lost sight of the ridges of Lebanon, when we passed successively those ancient seats of opulence and renown, Sidon and Tyre; then doubling a lofty cape, formed by a part of Mount Carmel shooting into the sea, a few hours' sail revealed a distant prospect of Cæsarea. As we drew near, I was astonished at the magnificence of the port. It is a harbor of an immense capacity as to vessels of all kinds and sizes, yet has it been formed wholly by the hand of art. The shore presents at this part of the coast an almost even line of sandy banks running from south to north, with none of those alternate projections and inlets which are proper for the security of ships against both the current of the sea and storms of wind. Wherefore, at the cost of an immense sum, did Herod the Great construct this artificial basin, — larger than the famous one at Athens, — wherein vessels can ride in perfect safety, protected especially against the violence of the southern gales, which in this region are chiefly to be feared. The water is enclosed by a mole in the shape of a half moon, which, bending round from the south, presents its open mouth to the north, whose gentle winds allow vessels at all times to obtain an entrance. This mole, wholly of marble, and of enormous proportions, offers to the eye on the outer side a continuous range of edifices, also of marble, which seemed to me palaces as I approached at a distance, but are designed for the reception of merchandise; while on the inner side, for its entire length, it affords a broad and spacious pavement, where the ships are lightened of their burdens, and, lashed to iron rings or pillars, ride securely till their cargoes for another voyage have been received. At the entrance of the harbor, and at the very extremity of the mole, there rises a lofty tower, upon the summit of which you behold a Colossus of Asia, while on the opposite side of the entrance, upon a similar tower which terminates the shorter arm of the mole, stands a Colossus of Rome, of the like huge proportions. Towers of the same height and size shoot up along the whole length of this vast wall, intended partly as an additional feature of magnificence, and partly as a defence against the assaults of an enemy. From the VOL. I. 2 inner shore of this wide basin, — which for vastness seems a lake, — rises by a gradual ascent the city, the streets which lead from the water being crossed at regular intervals by others of the same width, which run in an opposite direction. As our vessel, — its decks thronged with passengers, — floated, driven by a gentle northern breeze, within the embrace of this spacious haven, and the crowd of shipping, the long range of lofty towers, the city with its palaces, temples, and theatres, all opened at onec to my view, I thought I had never seen anything of a more impressive grandeur. I could with difficulty persuade myself that this was a city of Judea; that, where I had expected to behold a barbarous and uncultivated people, I should thus meet instead, all the signs of elegance and taste which had marked the cities of Greece and Syria, or are to be observed in the chief towns of Italy. I remembered, indeed, the magnificence and boundless wealth of Herod, but I do not think, my mother, that even you yourself are aware of the greatness of his achievements, not only here in Cæsarea, but, as I have heard, in many other of the cities of Judea. From some of my own nation, who have been fellow-passengers, and with whom I have enjoyed much pleasant intercourse, I have learned this; and in addition, more of the present condition and recent history of the country, than I could have obtained from any sources whatsoever in Rome. Of these things I shall impart what knowledge I have gathered at myfuture leisure. Let me, at present, return to our arrival. We thus floated into this beautiful harbor, making our way slowly along amongst vessels of all nations, which like ourselves were coming in, or departing, or riding securely at their anchors. The noise and confusion were scarcely less than in the Tiber. I enjoyed the scene greatly, as I do everywhere whatever leads to uproar and contention. Particularly was I delighted with the quarrels which arose among the sailors, when the vessels either could not easily pass each other, or became entangled, when it frequently came to blows, and more or fewer were overset into the water. If they who were thus thrust overboard did not readily recover themselves by clinging to the sides of the vessel, or laying hold upon some rope, the combatants then ceased till the drowning men were drawn up again. Yet are many daily lost in these rude encounters, and I myself saw blows given and taken, which seemed to me more than enough to demolish the head on which they fell. But when the governor of a people is full of quarrel, and violence, and injustice, how can anything better be expected from the very lowest of the populace! As I stood watching what was thus going on about me, I was surprised to find ourselves suddenly brought up against a vessel, which, from the bellowings that proceeded from it, I perceived to be crowded with wild beasts, and indeed the deck was covered with their cages. As I expressed to one who stood by me, and with whom I had had frequent intercourse during the voyage, my wonder to see such a cargo making its way into a port of Judea, where the customs and religion of the people differ so widely from those of Rome and other heathen cities, he replied, that they, who knew anything of the manner in which Judea had been governed by Herod, and after him by the Ethnarch, would see, in what had occasioned surprise to me, nothing but what agreed exactly with the now altered character of the population. I answered, that I was obliged to confess great ignorance of all that related to the Jews, as I was Roman born, and my reading and studies had lain in a quite different direction. At this flourish, which I had hoped should pass with him, he quickly rejoined, “You may be Roman born, but, if so, your Hebrew blood wears well, for the Jew looks out at your eyes as plainly as the Roman out of your cloak and your speech. Never hope to play Roman with those eyes in your head.” I was somewhat taken down, as you may suppose, by this; but I put the best face upon the matter, and said that I could not but acknowledge that, although I had been born in Rome, my parents had removed thither from the upper part of Judea. My education had, however, been so completely Roman, owing to my father's early abandonment of all outward observance of his faith, that it was strictly true, as I had stated, that my ignorance was great of all that related to the present condition and late history of the country of my ancestors. “The more the pity,” replied my companion, “that a son of Abraham should be found to deny his country and his ancestry, and make a boast of what should be his shame, that he knows nothing of the people from whom he sprung. It is to such traitors” — and his dark eye sparkled like a living coal, — “that Judea owes her slavery and her apostacy, — her slavery to a foreign yoke, and her apostacy from the faith and the customs of the early days of our history. The people are no longer Jews, but Herodians, Greeks, Romans, anything, — anything but Jews. Is this a city of Jews we are 2 * entering? It stands on the soil of Judea, but it belongs not to the rightful occupants of the soil. Cæsarea is first Greek, then Roman, last and least Jewish. But — a word in your ear — the Jews that are there are of the true stuff. They are zealous for the law and for liberty. A little thing would rouse them to the defence of either or both.” As he said this, our further conversation was suddenly interrupted by our vessel coming into violent contact with that containing the cargo of wild animals, which caused them to utter their savage cries with terrific uproar; and to this was added the oaths and shouts of the sailors and the pilots, each laying upon the other the fault of the encounter, and all preparing to go from words to blows. This issue was, however, happily avoided, and the vessels being soon free of each other, we proceeded on our way. “These animals,” then resumed the Jew, “about which you wondered that they should be here, are destined to the games instituted by Herod in commemoration of the building of Cæsarea, and which return every fifth year. On the third day from this they commence; and if you are a stranger in this part of the world, and would observe the customs of a new people, you will be well repaid for the delay by remaining and witnessing them.” I said “that I should certainly do so; that was abroad for the single purpose of seeing the people of various regions, and obtaining such knowledge as might in this way be gathered without much expense of labor or thought that although, as he had seen, I was no Jew except in the misfortune of having descended from that tribe, I was yet especially desirous of dwelling awhile among them, as, if not a polite or powerful nation, they certainly were a remarkable one, and well merited the observations of a curious traveller.” A mingled look of scorn and rage was the only response I received at first for this speech He paced the deck of the vessel a few moments and I supposed would not deign to hold further communication with me. He, however, soon returned to my side, having swallowed his indignation. “Young man,” said he, “I forgive the levity of your speech, for the reason that I well deserved it for persuading you to be present at heathen sports, on a Jewish soil. But in truth they have been now so long celebrated, that they have become a part of the life of the people, and it is only a few of the stricter sort who condemn them or keep back from them. It had agreed better with my real opinions, however, had I denounced them as I should have done, and warned thee against them. But you will use in this your liberty. I now wish to say that, in spite of your enmity toward your own people, I have conceived a regard for you, and while you shall sojourn in Cæsarea offer you my house and home; and once beneath the roof of a true son of Abraham, I will not doubt that your long perished affection for the land of your fathers may be revived, and that we may send you home a Jew in nature as — forgive me — you are in outward semblance.” “Were it only for an apprehension of such lamentable issue,” I rejoined, “I should feel compelled to decline your hospitable request. May I never be more of that of which I am already too much. But beside this, I am bound in obedience to the wishes of my mother, to seek out the dwelling of the widow of Sameas, the wine merchant, with whom it is my purpose to abide, if indeed she yet lives and can receive me, for it is very many years since we have heard of her welfare, and know not now whether she be even an inhabitant of Cæsarea.” To this the stranger replied with vivacity, “The widow of Sameas! Ah, the Lord be thanked for directing your course to that haven. She is a true mother in Israel. She still lives and dwells in Cæsarea, and is of good estate. Sameas was no idler; and when he died, his widow and children inherited the fruits of his industry; and but for the unjust exactions of Pilate, their wealth had been second to that of few within the walls. As it is, they enjoy competence and more. But the dearest wealth of the house is the zeal for the law and the rights of Judea which fires the souls of Philip and Anna, the son and daughter of the Merchant. The best I can wish thee, therefore, my young Roman, is that thou mayest dwell a space in the house of Sameas, for if there be but a drop of Jewish blood in thy body, I fear not but their ardor will so warm and swell it, that it shall fill all thy veins.” We were now separated, the vessel having reached the spot where she was to be secured, and the passengers making ready to depart. The Jew, my companion, took leave of me, after first directing me in such a manner that I could not fail to find the dwelling of the widow of the wine merchant. It was with little satisfaction that I looked forward to a residence with a family of Jewish zealots. It was enough, I thought, that I had borne so long, and with such patience, the reproaches of my own mother, quite enough that, in addition, I had just been exposed to the vituperations of a fanatic, from whom I had happily escaped alive, without being now for many days, how many I could not know, but for many days shut up, without the possibility of escape, in the very hot-bed of Judaism. What a fate for me! I had almost resolved to take ship, without so much as landing, for Alexandria, when the image of your sorrowful and rebuking countenance, my mother, presented itself before me, and I turned dutifully toward the quarter of the city where dwelt the merchant. To reach it I must pass through the central parts of the city, to where it first joins the country. The place I sought I easily found; for Cæsarea, dear mother, although the capital of Judea, is not so large as Rome. And moreover as I passed along, I could not but judge that it would scarce be so enduring, seeing that, though presenting everywhere the marks of newness, it presents also everywhere the signs of premature decay. A city built in a day is very likely to last but a day. And all around, are Herod's piles of building, whether in the form of theatre, temple, market-place, or quay, already perceived to yield to the effects of time. Even the palace of the Governor, which erewhile was the residence of Herod himself, is in parts of it, ruinous through the falling asunder of the ill cemented masonry. Pilate could hardly trust to his walls to defend him against any rising of the citizens. But he is in little danger at any time, as I think, considering what the population of the city is, notwithstanding the enmity of the Jewish portion of the inhabitants. The dwelling of Sameas, after traversing the entire breadth of the city, I at length reached. A beggar issuing from a gate-way, laden with the proofs of the benevolence to which he had successfully appealed, was the only person of whom I could inquire which of the dwellings near me was that of the widow of the wine merchant. He answered, pointing to his sack of commodities which he was bearing away, “From whom but the widow of Sameas do the poor of Cæsarea depart laden in this fashion? Pass yonder threshold and thou shalt find thyself in paradise.” So saying, and waving his arm with dignity, he turned away to count over his stolen treasures. The kindhearted we always approach with confidence, so that with a quicker pace I passed the gateway and entered a spacious garden, in the centre of which, almost buried beneath overhanging foliage and flowers of every variety of form and hue, stood the dwelling of the wine merchant. A slave now immediately approached, saying he would conduct me to that part of the house where I should see those for whom I sought. As he led me on, and I observed the great beauty of the spot, and the many tokens of wealth and refinement in the garden and in the dwelling, the forms and proportions of which were now distinctly to be seen through the opening trees, I found myself growing to a more complacent humor, and better disposed, than when I left the vessel, to greet with some appearance of warmth the widow of the virtuous Sameas. It is true, I saw statue neither of god or goddess, nor vase of marble curiously wrought with nymphs and fawns, and young, dancing, half-drunk Bacchuses; nor did the imperial forms of Augustus and Tiberius greet my eye, as they do everywhere in street and garden, market-place and shop in Rome. So that from art much was wanting to give the truest grace to the picture before me; but nature seemed to have made good all defect of this sort by her superior charms; and I was made soon to forget what at first struck me as a want, by the novelty and surpassing richness and variety of plants, trees, and shrubs, both native and foreign, which met my eye. I lingered to admire, and would, at that moment, rather have remained among the beauties of nature, than have gone farther to encounter the living beauties of these half-barbarian regions; but I was civilly urged on by the attending slave, and so in a few moments ushered into the presence of the widow and her daughter. They were seated in a large and lofty portico, whose arches, overhung with flowers, opened immediately into the garden, while here and there, as the trees permitted, were seen gleaming through, the light blue waters of the Mediterranean. The mother was occupied in some labor of the needle, adjusting or repairing what seemed to me some military garment — the daughter in arranging in groups, apparently to please her own eye, some flowers which lay spread in rich profusion upon a marble table. I may suppose that I was taken to be some new applicant for the alms of the rich and benevolent widow, as the daughter, to my vexation, did not raise her head at my approach, and the mother did but rise and move toward me with a stately step — yet, I must add, with an expression of gentleness in the countenance. When I had finished my introductory narrative, and had declaimed of yourself and myself, and of the whole tribe of Alexanders, from those of Beth-Harem to those of Rome, I was one by one greeted with many smiles of welcome, and before I had ended was seated between the mother and daughter, both apparently pleased to entertain a stranger from Rome, but VOL. I. 3 still more, perhaps, one of our ancient and honorable house. The daughter, as I had spoken, turned and looked upon me, and at first I thought I had never seen anything quite so dark and forbidding as her countenance; but when, as I proceeded, it came to be lighted up with emotion and with smiles, it at length put on a more agreeable aspect, though still so dark an olive I thought I had never seen upon the skin, nor eyes so large and black set in the human head. Among all who have thronged your house from Judea, my mother, one so extremely Jewish as this young Israelite was never seen there. When I had further satisfied the widow concerning yourself, giving her so minute an account of your life and character, that I fear some part at least must have been invention rather than fact, and then had replied to all the questions which were put to me — with a real interest in public affairs — concerning Tiberius and the present power of Sejanus, the mother said, that she had hoped the provinces would be more fortunate than the capital; and indeed had hardly thought it possible that, while there was one like Tiberius in Rome, another like Pilate could have been found for Judea; but — lately especially — it was only too plain that we were to be the victims of a tyrannic power hardly less than they of Rome. I replied, “that where the head of a great empire was such a one as Tiberius, it was a natural consequence that all in society like him should float upon the surface. They would crawl forth from the hiding places of their vices, and grow great in the sunshine of their mighty example and patron. Men like your governor are common enough now in Rome, though not always are they fortunate enough to rise into place. For though the Emperor himself chooses to play the tyrant, he is not so ready as one might suppose to multiply himself in his subordinates.” “Is it not singular, then,” said Anna, “that he persists in retaining Pilate in his office, notwithstanding his cruelties, and the enmity of the people?” “He may do that,” I answered, “in agreement with a sentiment he has been heard to utter, that to change a cruel or rapacious governor of a province, is but to send a new and hungry robber to take the place of one who has already gorged himself, and is likely to rest and sleep, as it is the nature of an animal to do when he has filled himself; just as the poor wretch covered with sores begged that the flies already feeding might not be driven away, since it would only make room for a hungrier swarm.” “That,” said the young Jewess, “is indeed the sentiment of a heartless tyrant — of one who is not only indifferent to the misery he occasions, but can make a jest of it. If Rome bears patiently with the greater monster, I trust that Judea will not with the lesser.” “Take heed, my daughter,” said the widow, “how your righteous indignation finds too loud and warm an expression. There is some truth in the saying of Tiberius. We may drive away Pilate only to be cursed with a worse man.” “That were impossible,” cried the daughter. “Were you ever in Rome?” said I. “No,” replied the young girl. “I thought as much. Believe me, there are worse men in Rome than Pilate. I know those in the city — men, too, of note — who, were they here, would put to open shame the deeds of your present governor. Tiberius has proved already a rare schoolmaster. His pupils abound in the capital and throughout Italy.” “And Capreæ is just at present the schoolroom,” said Anna. “Yes, and too small for the scholars who crowd it. But, if you can pardon my ignorance, of what have you to complain here in Cæsarea? I have noticed on my arrival, and as I passed through your city, only signs of prosperity and peace; nor since I left Rome, nor indeed before for a long time, have I heard anything of evils which you are suffering under.” “Ah,” said Anna, with animation, “I know how it is with you Roman Jews. You grow to be so in love with the greatness of your adopted country, that you are soon strangely forgetful of that from which you sprang. The wrongs and sufferings of Judea, which cry to Heaven, are not heard in the din of great events and the whirl of pleasure. Many of you, so am I told, deny your name and country, and put on the dress and take the name of Roman. Pray Heaven it is not so with you, for your face is honest, and —” In her earnestness she suddenly paused, and her dark skin was covered with blushes that made her for the moment beautiful. Her eye fell upon my Roman dress, and she perceived that she had involved me in the condemnation she had pronounced. Almost enjoying her confusion, I said, “I confess my recreancy. But you will judge me with more lenity, I am sure, when I tell you how odious a thing it is to bear the name of Jew in Rome. Were one born a full grown man, he might, perhaps, find philosophy enough to steel him against the taunts and 3 * gibes of those about him. But with only the tender sensibilities of a child — it is quite too hard a yoke to bear. Roman boys taught me early to both hate and despise the religion of my fathers, which, as all the treatment I received on every side, and all the language I heard assured me, would procure for me nothing better than contempt and insult. My father, too, had renounced all of Judaism that he could. He never entered a synagogue; he observed none of the Jewish rites or festivals; his phrases were set to Roman measures; and his outward homage was paid with scrupulousness to pagan institutions, though that he despised them in his heart as much as he hated his own belief, I do not doubt. Gold, gold was his only God; and he cared not for man, but as he might help or hinder him in that only worship of his heart. Do not, my friends, accuse me of filial impiety for these sentiments. For a parent who provided for me only gold, and whose only legacy was gold, I can feel no very lively emotions of gratitude. I received from him none of the signs of a parent's love. He hardly knew me. As he moved in the morning to the narrow vault in Rome's vast centre, where he amassed his riches, with his eyes looking inwards upon some new scheme of wealth, blind and deaf to all beside and without him, he would pass me in the street as a stranger, though his eyes fell directly on me; and if I made some childish advances, which I soon learned not to do; a frown and a rebuke for a troublesome vagrant that I was, was all I ever received. As I grew into years I drew no nearer to him, nor he to me. Whatever was needful to my education in all the wisdom of the Romans or the Greeks, was bountifully supplied; nor was I denied that, whatever it might be, which wealth could procure, which was thought necessary to place me on a level with the young men of the capital in any pursuit or pleasure. But to my father's counsels or business I was never admitted. Of a single thought of his mind, or anxiety of his heart, I was never permitted to be a sharer. Here I was an annoyance and a hindrance. How can you wonder, then, I added, that I grew up not a Jew but a Roman? or how can you greatly blame me? You, my mother, will not, I am sure, condemn me for this freedom. You, more than I, know how to justify it. But when I had said these things, I then drew another picture of my other parent, and showed how all your endeavors in an opposite direction could not but fail, with all Rome and my father against you. As I paused, the widow of Sameas said, “It is not strange, such being your nurture, that Rome rather than Judea should possess your heart; nor that you should be ignorant of the condition of what to you must ever have been a place so obscure or unknown as Cæsarea. Let us hope that being now here, a witness as you will be of our frequent oppressions and insults, the love of Judea, which, sure I am, you drew in with your mother's milk, will revive, and unite you to her interests. Not that I am an advocate for open resistance. That as I deem were madness itself. We can never oppose Rome but we must be crushed. I mean only that by a wise and manly perseverance in an assertion of our just rights, both before the governor and the Emperor at Rome, we may at length perhaps obtain some redress, and the removal of some burdens, which weigh upon us with a weight too heavy to be borne.” “But your numbers,” I said, “must be so great, I should judge as a stranger, as to be a sufficient protection against lawless violence or rapacity on the part of the Roman governor. With a military force not more numerous than his, he must be weaker than the united populace.” “Ah,” replied Anna, “there is the evil we suffer under. We are not united. Even among ourselves there are those who judge very differently of the measures we ought to pursue; some are for giving blow for blow, while others counsel moderation and forbearance. And then, do you not know it? the greater part of our population is Greek, and the Greek is an enemy more bitter than even the Roman. Quarrels continually arise, and blood is often shed. The streets of Cæsarea have I seen more than once, young as I am, to run with the blood of those who have perished in these wild combats, the Greeks always in league with the Romans. Even now — but see, here comes Philip, and with ill news too, if his face may be read.” The young man, her brother, entered with haste as Anna spoke, his countenance expressive of anything but agreeable intelligence. He was above the common height, of a proud and lofty air, and a very athlete in his firm and well knit joints and massy limbs; while his countenance, dark and lowering, made you think him one designed by nature for scenes of strife and war, or even for deeds of private violence and revenge. He saluted me as his mother made me known to him, with a look and manner which declared that he at once comprehended me. He immediately addressed himself with vehemence to his mother and sister. “Our suit has been rejected, and the Greeks have triumphed. 'T is as I said it would be. A new insult is heaped upon us, and our ears are again to ring with the hisses and laughter of the city. Our warnings, our appeals, our entreaties, for we even entreated, availed nothing to change his stubborn will. He sat on his tribunal white as marble, hard as marble, cold as marble. May God do so to me, and more also, —” “Nay, nay, Philip, my son, curse not,” said his mother. “To bear is a virtue and a duty, as well as to act. Be not enslaved to your passions. Another day and Pilate may be in a better mood. He is not always thus.” “Mother, mother,” cried the young man, “if we bear more or longer, we shall deserve to bear forever; if we yield now, were I a Roman, I would no longer deign to use a Jew for my footstool, — I would not spit upon him. Nor will we yield. So says Eleazer, and so says Simon.” “Were they with you at your audience?” “They were; and from a prophet's lips there never came forth more moving words than from those of the holy Simon. Yet upon the pillars of the Hall they fell as persuasively as on the ears of Pilate. His icy front never once warmed or relaxed, or not till he uttered his decree, and the base rabble, set on by Lycias and Philæus, laughed and shouted as we turned away. How, my mother, would you have liked to be there?” The mother made no reply; but tears fell from her eyes. The face of the daughter burned with the sense of indignity and wounded pride. Philip, chafed by his own hot and hasty temper, rose, and withdrew into the garden. I followed him. Had I been easy of defeat, I should instantly have been repelled by the manner which he assumed, as he perceived that I was near him. But, as I had my own purposes to answer, I heeded him little. I joined him in his walk, and soon succeeded in convincing him that, in seeking his conversation, I had some end before me of more dignity than the mere gratification of an idle curiosity, or the passing away of a few idle moments. I gave him an account of myself, and of our family, and in return solicited such information as he was willing to impart concerning the present condition of the city, and especially of its Jewish inhabitants, in whom I could not but feel a deep interest. “I know not,” he said, with bitterness, “what interest a Roman can take in the Jews of Cæsarea.” I answered “that, perhaps, I was not so much a Roman as at first appearance he might think me; that it was true I had been almost taught from my infancy to despise my own origin, and I had indeed consorted chiefly with Romans, but that, notwithstanding the devotion I had manifested for everything Roman, there was still a feeling within that clung with a secret fondness to the land and the stock, from which I had come, and which had shown itself with a new force since I found myself on the shores of Judea, but especially since I had been beneath his roof, and had heard what I had.” He took this very coolly, and seeming to regard what I had said as words of civility, rather than anything more serious, he replied, “that I was too lately in the country to be able to join myself with intelligence to one party or another of the inhabitants; that, if it had been my habit for so many years to look upon the Jew with the eye of a Roman, to wear the Roman garb, and use the Roman tongue, and receive a Roman's homage, it was little likely my feeling of regard for the Jew in these remote outposts would be a very lasting one, seeing to how much greater danger he is exposed here than in Rome; nor was it to be much wondered at that it should be so with me.” I answered, “that I was sure my interest was as far as it went a sincere one; and if it had become a stronger one just in proportion to my better knowledge of my countrymen, and of their state, it was probable, that as I knew more, this sentiment would go on to increase in strength; and I was obliged to acknowledge, that I was, even to the present moment, extremely ignorant of the true circumstances of the Jewish people. What, I asked, is the present difficulty here in Cæsarea? A particular instance of injury on one side, and of oppression on the other, if you will give me its history, will pour more light and truth into my mind than can come from any other source.” He then, with something more of regard in his manner, invited me to follow him to a more remote part of the garden, where the ground rising to a gentle eminence, and crowned with a small building, which served as a protection from the rays of the sun, gave to those who sat within a prospect of the whole extent of Cæsarea, together with the harbor, and the Mediterranean beyond. Here we seated ourselves, and Philip gave me the information for which I had asked. “The present hostility of one part of our city toward the other,” he said, “is nothing new to those who dwell here, nor does it spring from anything new in the circumstances in which you find us. We owe not all, but the worst evils of our condition, to Herod the Great. For, when he had, determined, among other VOL. I. 4 magnificent projects, to found on this spot a city in honor of Cæsar, instead, — as would better have become him, — of filling it with the people over whom he was set as king, called hither a colony of Greeks, making out of them, and those who came from Rome and other parts of Italy, what was in truth a Pagan city. Everywhere throughout our land, even in Jerusalem itself, had he used every endeavor, and every subtle art to change the institutions of our nation, or secretly undermine them by the grafting upon them of heathen usages. Theatres, amphitheatres, and games, the combats of gladiators and of wild beasts, were to be witnessed in all our considerable cities, and even within the precints of Jerusalem itself. The people were not without an affection for the customs he thus brought in, and, even as in the days of Moses and the prophets they were prone to idolatry, so now were they prompt to worship the new idols set up before them by the great king. They were weary of the distinctions of both belief and custom, which separated them from the rest of the world, which especially built up a wall of partition between them and the refined and polite nations, the Romans and the Greeks. A large proportion of the people, therefore, entered with zeal into all the projects of Herod, which went to make our nation agree, as far as possible, with the other nations of the world. Here, in Cæsarea, he designed even that the people should be wholly Greek, if not in descent, at least in language and manners. Hebrews were not, indeed, by the laws of the place, excluded, but none were encouraged to dwell here, but such as were willing to call themselves Herodians. And what more or better was to be looked for from a base peasant of Ascalon? But, as you may believe, when the walls of the city were once up, and the port had been enclosed from the sea, and inhabitants began to pour in from every part of the world, the Jew also, — not the Herodian, but the Jew as well — was not blind to the advantages which presented themselves here to his industry, nor slow to seize upon them. Large numbers of such as were zealous for the law accordingly flocked hither from all parts of Judea, and especially from Jerusalem, and here pursued their craft, and here built their synagogues. But they were looked upon with an evil eye, — even as they are in Rome or Alexandria, — and quarrels, in no long time, broke out, and served to increase the general hatred, in which Greeks held the Jews, and the Jews the Greeks. This spirit of hate we have inherited from our parents; and fresh instances of indignity, on the part of the Greeks, have served to inflame it, and impart a tenfold bitterness. It has never died away; and when there has been an apparent peace, the same amount of angry passion has been running beneath, ready at any moment to break forth. What has within a few days happened, to enrage so our people, you may deem a slight and insufficient cause; but so thinks not the true and loyal Jew. He would die rather than renounce his ancient rights. Listen a moment longer. No sooner was Cæsarea filled in part by Jews zealous of the law, than, in agreement with their customs, they erected synagogues for their worship, and in process of years have multiplied themselves in every part of the city. Now it has happened, some of our tribe having been among the earliest inhabitants of Cæsarea, that they came to be possessors of lands and houses, which then, indeed, were at the very outer limits of the city, but now, by reason of its growth, make its very centre. And our chief synagogue, so Providence has willed, stands, as you may have seen, not far from the palace of Herod, upon a rising ground, where it is seen of all who come in or go out, and has long been, for that reason, an occasion of envy to the Greeks. After many fruitless endeavors to deprive us of it, they have devised a new plan, which, because it is made to be a sign of their devotion to Cæsar, Pilate will not oppose, although persuaded that not devotion to Cæsar, but malignity and envy toward the Jews have moved them. They have declared their purpose to erect a colossus to Tiberius, and beg of Pilate the very spot where stands the temple of our worship, which, they require, shall be levelled with the ground, that the image of a man and a monster, yet whom they will by and by call a god, may stand upon its ruins. Sooner may the great sea rise and sweep, not Cæsarea only, but Judea, from the face of the earth, than such a deed be done, while a Jew lives to ward it off; that were a judgment of God, and we would meet with open arms the rushing flood; this, but the wrath of wicked men, and, as before against the hosts of Moab, so must we now rise up as one man against the hosts of Rome. This, said Philip, is the condition of Cæsarea, and such the posture of our affairs. It offers little to interest a stranger, least of all a Roman.” I told him, in reply, “that it was not a thing to choose with me, whether I should take part with the oppressed; my nature impelled me that way; that, notwithstanding my Roman nurture, and Roman prejudices, I had still observed 4* with indignation the place, which in Rome had been assigned the Jew, and the manner in which, both by those in power and the common citizen, he had been treated; that nothing there could be done by so few against so many, and I had waited, hoping that time might, in its changes, bring some redress. But I had waited in vain, and I could only cry out against the fortune, which had made me a Roman by birth, but a Jew by blood, and so the heir of a hated and degraded name. Finding myself now upon the soil of my proper country, and hearing what I now had from himself, and what had been communicated by others, I could not but confess that my heart had grown warmer toward my native land, and I should watch with interest the affairs which were now in agitation.” Philip replied, “that I should do well to examine for myself into the state of the city, and by inquiry upon both sides, learn the exact truth in respect to the particular dispute of which he had spoken. He hoped I should dwell with them a while, and from that point, as a centre, make, my observations. But if, upon a short survey, I found myself a Roman still, I should do well, within a few days, to take my departure, since with the same certainty that Pilate adhered to his present resolution, would there be uproar, violence, and bloodshed in Cæsarea.” I said, “that no prospect of such an event, even though I should remain neutral, would drive me from Cæsarea, if for any other reasons whatever it should be my wish to prolong my residence, for I was a lover of anything else better than a state of repose, and should choose to stay and see the conflict carried on to its end. But, if I might judge from my present feelings and convictions, and if nothing adverse occurred, I should be ready to take part with him and his friends in any measures they might think it proper to adopt.” I can see an approving smile light up your countenance, my mother, as you read these words, just such a smile as came over the features, stern and dark as they were, of Philip. He took my hand with passion as I ended, saying, “he hoped God would confirm me in my present purpose, and turn my heart wholly toward the deliverance of Judea. What was about to happen in Cæsarea was truly a small matter, but it might prove the beginning of mighty revolutions. A spark had set whole cities on fire. What shall be done here, may stir up those of Jerusalem to deeds of the same sort. They especially bear Pilate no love for insults put upon them many years ago. Now will be the time for vengeance. If I judge not our people amiss, they need but such an example as we shall set them to show themselves worthy of their fathers.” I assured him, as he said this, “that I should now remain in Cæsarea till the present affair was ended, putting off my journey to Beth-Harem; and though I should not consciously interpret falsely the signs that might appear, I should not be sorry if I felt myself bound to remain here rather than go farther. I was a stranger to those in Beth-Harem, as well as to all else in Judea, and my only tie was that which now bound me so agreeably to Cæsarea.” “Are you, then,” asked Philip, with eagerness, “on the way to Beth-Harem, and do you know the great Onias, who truly may be called the prince of that region?” He was both amazed and overjoyed when he learned that Onias was the brother of my own mother; amazed, as he said, that I should to so late a period have remained a stranger to one so great as he, and my own uncle, and overjoyed that through me possibly he might be able to draw Onias over to take part in their affairs. “Yet,” he added, a shade passing over his countenance, “it will not be much that a Roman, or at best, but a half-Jew, can do for us with Onias. There is only one thing Onias scorns more than a Roman, and that is a Roman Jew.” I told him, that, perhaps, before I should see Onias, if I saw him at all, I might, by the events here in Cæsarea, be converted to a veritable Hebrew, one whom he would not disdain to take by the hand and admit to his counsels, in which case my services should not be wanting. Philip hoped it might be so; and then, after more conversation of the same sort, he rose, and taking me first to different parts of the extensive garden, brought me at length to the house, where we found the mother and daughter awaiting us, at a table spread with the best hospitality of the East. I enjoyed the repast, my mother, I must confess, not less than some of those in Rome, at which Drusus has presided, and where I have reclined upon patrician couches. Never, indeed, did I enjoy myself or my companions more. Yet am I the same person who say this? Am I he, who but so little while ago shunned a Jew as a Jew shuns a leper? Am I he, whose highest ambition hitherto hath been to ape the Roman, talk like him, walk like him, dress like him, smile like him, frown like him, and who now am the inmate of Jews, — Jews, not of Rome, who are somewhat, but of Judea, who are the refuse and offscouring of the earth, the loathing of the Roman, the scorn of the Greek, the hatred of all men; a people fit but to be the drudges and slaves of politer nations? Truly, I doubt if I be Julian, the son of Alexander, who but so late left Rome on his Eastern travels, the bosom friend of Quintius Hirpinus and Appius Lucretius, his fellow-travellers, both sons and companions of princes, and have not been, by some strange power, changed to another nature, and another person. Of another nature I certainly am, — at least of another mind; or rather, perhaps, I have come or am coming to a knowledge of my true mind, which in men oftentimes lies buried, as I think, out of sight, till events, or the will of God, reveal it. Well, most beloved mother, of one thing I am sure, that whatever change of this sort has come upon me, thou art the happier for it. Now thou hast hopes that I shall not forever bring shame upon my descent and my kindred; that I shall now, at length, perhaps, set before me the great and excellent of my native land for my examples, in place of those of Rome; some holy David, or Ahab, or Haman, if my memory be right, and try upon such steps to mount up to honor and fame in the eyes of my proper countrymen. May that come to pass, whatever it may be, which shall impart to thee the greatest pleasure. I have now passed in this ocean capital, this Jewish Rome, two days; and they have not been wholly barren of events or pleasures. But what chiefly they have impressed upon my mind is the speedy certainty of riot and violence within the city. The mutual hostility of the different portions of the inhabitants I find to be bitter to an extreme degree. The signs are many, and distinct enough, of approaching tumult. No Jew passes a Greek, but he must take an insult; and if it be returned, it then comes to blows, and others join, and the fight rages till they are separated by the Roman horse. The synagogues, often beautiful with marble, or sculptured wood, have been defaced by filth, which the licentious rabble have hurled upon them, when protected by the night. So, too, have the houses of the principal men among them been dealt with in the like manner. Yet, of all this the Roman power takes no note, but looks on, apparently pleased with the violences and indignities which are put upon the barbarians, or their only care is that there shall be no general combats; and to this end, the guard of the governor has been doubled, and ere the decree to raze the devoted synagogue shall go into effect, a legion, it is so reported, will be drawn from Jerusalem. Philip, in the mean time, with others of the principal citizens, is working in secret to make ready, in the last resort, such a defence as shall, perhaps, strike Pilate as too formidable to be trifled with. Yet, it is their purpose, that no general resistance by arms shall be made, till all other means have been tried to soften the obstinacy of the governor. The Jews, after a consultation among those who are chief among them, have resolved upon another and more numerous deputation to Pilate. Five hundred of their number, headed by the priests and elders of the synagogues, are appointed again to present themselves before the governor, and intercede for the people and their religion. All have agreed in this measure, but it has been chiefly urged by the Herodians, who are unwilling that the present peaceful order of things should be disturbed. They are for quiet and peace, on whatever terms of submission, and for adopting, to the farthest extent possible, without the absolute surrender of their national religion, the customs and usages of both Roman and Greek; it being with them, as it hath been with others whom I could name elsewhere, a point of vanity to strip themselves of everything, that by its strangeness should proclaim them Jews, retaining little but the name, and a very slight observance of their sabbaths, fast-days, and other laws and institutions of the like kind. They advocate forbearance and delay now, for the reason especially that the games of Herod are just about to be celebrated, and ought not to be disturbed. The more zealous Jews have united with them, because, for the most part, they would sincerely deprecate a general quarrel, in which the affair now seems likely enough to terminate, and hope, by a fair show of temperance and patience, to carry their end against the Greeks. But, among these last, there is a small number, — small compared with the whole, — but composed of men who set their religion before all other things, who will suffer nothing to be done, which shall so much as seem to cast contempt upon it, if even by the sacrifice of their lives the evil can be averted. These are men the most singular I have ever yet met with. Religion is to them, as they say, and as one sees, more than life; yet they are filled at the same time with the darkest, fiercest passions. The very temper and soul of the assassin seem lodged within them, so that to defend some ceremony or law of their worship, from slight or insult, they would not pause to involve a whole city in war and bloodshed. Philip, I need hardly say, is one of these; while his mother and sister, though belonging to the number of the zealous, yet are truly desirous to avoid open violence. He rather desires it, that he may revenge himself and his religion upon such as have oppressed and injured them. If, VOL. I. 5 my mother, thou wouldst know upon what side, and leagued with whom stands thy unworthy son, who as yet may be termed little more than a proselyte of the gate, — he can hardly to-day inform thee. He is at present rather a lookeron than an actor; and on which side he will by-and-by find himself, he pretends not to say. Of one thing, however, is he certain, that he will stand guardian in any time of danger over the widow of Sameas and her dark-skinned daughter. Anna thinks thus; — and she makes pretensions to a great gift of discernment; “Julian,” she said to her mother, “seems little enough of our side, if one judges by the costume, the air, and by words that lie on the surface of discourse. But by the motions of his countenance last night, when he sat listening to the words of Simon, am I sure that his heart must ever be on the side of the injured; and by what he did not say, am I sure that, either because of the early instructions of his mother, or because of his very nature, it is only the God and the faith of Moses that will ever give him rest. He wants more than he has. And where shall he find it but here among us?” So said the wise and penetrating Anna. Her mother smiled, and nodded, as if assenting. I only said in reply something that implied my thought, “that among the Jews, as among the Romans, there was too much in their religion of what was only ceremonial and barren, that too many seemed to think it enough to meet the letter of some dead ritual, while the practice of virtue was overlooked.” She only looked sad and sorrowful, as I said this, which was to me as if she had confessed that it was true enough of great proportions of her people. In her own heart, I knew it was sufficiently otherwise, though I could not say so. There is, I am sure, truth and faith enough in her to save a city. Cæsarea is now filling with the numbers of those from the country round about, who are pouring in to witness the games of Herod; numbers greater than usual, drawn now not only by a desire to see the sports, but by curiosity and interest concerning the present difference. Philip assures me that the zealous are arriving from great distances. When some new events have happened, I will write again; till then, farewell.” In this slight vein, in those days of my more than Egyptian darkness, did I open myself to my mother; who did not, thereupon, deny and disown me, as she might justly enough have done, but had patience with me, and by her timely counsels strove, and not wholly in vain, to carry up to a full and perfect growth those feelings of love toward my native country, which then just began to show themselves. In this manner, also, like a child, did I suffer myself to be afflicted, by the general hatred entertained toward our people by the other nations of the world; a hatred of which I had more reason to boast, seeing that it had its birth in those religious distinctions which exalted us above every other people. Had I possessed any power of reflection, also, or any knowledge of their writings who anciently had discoursed of the Jews, I should have perceived that all of this hatred and contempt, that had not its natural origin in envy of our superior advantages, was to be charged upon the lies, which, first engendered in the brain of the execrable Manetho, — fruitful of lies as the Nile of reptiles, — had then descended an inheritance of falsehood and error through succeeding generations, but which had ever been greedily seized upon, and with unabating malignity constantly transmitted to those who were to come after. Even the Romans, notwithstanding their greatness of character, and notwithstanding so many families of our nation had lived among them with distinction, and had even been entertained as favorites in the very household of the Cæsars, were not ashamed to treat us with the like injustice, and continually reproach us with our origin and our laws. But the wickedness and injustice were not greater on their part, than were both the vanity and the baseness on mine, so manifest in my courting the favor and regard of those who, at the very same time, so openly despised the people from whom I sprung. As you shall soon learn, however, I was presently cured of a folly, which, I doubt not now, made me to be scorned by the very persons who seemed most to flatter me; for he can never be held as worthy of a real esteem, who appears to be ashamed of his own kindred. Again I draw from my letters to my mother; for although my recollection is exact and vivid of those days and events, so that, as I think, I could set them down in order, applying to that source alone, yet in this the beginning of my history, I shall, I doubt not, more perfectly comply with your wishes, my kinsmen of Rome, if I appear before you in the very form in which I painted myself in these remote days. It was thus then, the second time, that I addresed myself to the blessed Naomi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5* II. I said, my mother, that I would write again so soon as new events had happened. That necessity presented itself immediately upon my sending to you the letter which I last wrote, — if those may by called new events which are to be witnessed, not so much in saparate acts or occurrences, as in the ripening of the time toward some general and final issue. Such seems to me to be the condition of Cæsarea. Large numbers of the people indeed, both Jews and Greeks, are little concerned by this quarrel with the Governor, being wholly engrossed by the expected games, either preparing to attend them with every circumstance of display, or to receive into their dwellings as visitors during their continuance, the friends and kinsfolk who make it their five years' custom to assemble at Cæsarea at this great festival. But greater numbers, however, although together with the rest they look forward to the games with pleasure, and to the entertainment of both friends and strangers, are much more deeply engaged by the difficulties of which I have already given you some account. The games may occupy their hands, but other interests, hopes, and fears are busy at their hearts. Especially is this the case with the Jewish portion of the population. No one would dream that less than an empire were at hazard, to judge by the demeanor of this people. In truth they seem to me at all times a solemn tribe; and this feature of their general character is darkened to a gloom like that of night, by the present aspect of their affairs. Their motion through the street is slow and cautious, with eyes cast down, or talking with one another in low and secret tones — turning continually with sudden movement the head to this side and that, as if expecting instantly the blow of an assassin, or the insult of a Greek. I confess myself amused not a little as I watch them. But if this is so with the Jews generally — or rather with the more zealous portion of them — how much more is it true of so fierce a spirit as Philip. Not the dark Casca nor the lean Cassius ever carried in their eyes what so threatened States with ruin and revolt. Although I cannot but judge his cause in the main a right one, yet can I not work up myself to his pitch of fury; but, on the contrary, do what in me lies, partly by reason, and partly by a lighter rhetoric, to soothe his almost disordered mind. My success has been much such as it would have been, had I essayed to stem the northern tide as it rushes in at the open mouth of the Port, making colossal Rome and Asia to tremble on their bases. On the morning of the day which preceded the opening of the games, and which was to witness the hearing of the Jewish deputation before Pilate, the air being close and oppressive, I sought the cooler walks of the Garden, and reaching the little arbor of which I have spoken, took out my tablets and wrote. I had been not long thus engrossed, when I was interrupted by the sudden entrance of Anna, with a countenance more than usually expressive of anxiety. She seated herself near me, saying, as she did so, “I have come seeking you, and am glad to have found you here, and yet I hardly know why I have come, and I fear lest I deprive you of time that you need for more important objects.” I assured her that I was performing no duty of more importance than writing to my mother, and that her own name was the last from my pen; of what I had said concerning her I could not inform her; it was, however, no evil report, she might well believe. But what, I asked, was it which disturbed her, for her countenance spoke of some new alarm. “It is nothing new,” she answered, “nor anything, I fear, in which you will think you can serve us, and I hardly can say why I apply to you — yet you have inspired us with a strange confidence, and we think that because you are from Rome, while still you are of our own race, you will judge of our affairs more justly than we can do, who are so near, that everything appears of perhaps an unnatural size and interest. In a word, my mother begs you, and I join her in the entreaty, to use whatever power you may possess, to moderate the zeal of Philip, and hold him back from aspiring to be a leader in these affairs. I, alas, can do nothing; for no sooner does he appear with that face of his, and his burning words, than I am straightway kindled with his ardor, and grow as hot as he.” I told her, “that what she had now asked of me, I had already of my own mind attempted, but with no good effect whatever. Philip will take no counsellor to his bosom, beside his own impatient spirit, and Simon, who, good as he is, is mad as Philip himself.” “Mad! — Julian? Oh, not quite mad” — “My dear Anna, you cannot yourself bear the whole truth.” “I will try — now say on — you must forgive me.” “Take, however, Anna, all that I would say, and not a part only. Philip is mad only in his impetuosity and haste; not wholly in the great purposes which he cherishes. I blame him not that he is restive, as a Jew, beneath Roman oppression, such as I now see it with my own eyes to be. I can with him scorn the base spirits who, with new submissions, are waiting to purchase the forbearance of the Governor. Were I a born Jew of Cæsarea, I would with Philip be a Jew in the full possession and enjoyment of my rights, or I would renounce together my faith and my country. A Jew, with the name only, is one who, with wonderful folly invites insult from the whole world, while from that which brings this universal contempt upon his head, he derives neither profit nor pleasure. In this, Anna, I speak the words of experience. I would not that Philip should be the fool that I have been. You will be glad to know, in respect to myself, that in the few days I have been here, I have lived years, and that the Demon who has so long possessed me is departing. I am become a Jew in feeling, at least, as well as in name. Henceforward, if I am still to bear reproach, it shall not be for nought. Such at least is the resolve of to-day. You now cannot doubt that I am on Philip's side, that with him I would fight for the fair rights and the honored name.” — “Ah! how I bless you,” cried Anna with glowing cheeks, “for these words. You then think with Philip, that he is right” — “But you came to me, Anna, did you not, that I might oppose him?” She answered nothing, but only covered her face with her hands. “I think Philip to be both right and wrong,” I then continued, “as, you would see yourself, if you would reflect one moment. In his principles and general purpose, he is right, so I judge; in his present action, he is wrong. He is over hasty. He will but inflame both the Governor and the Greeks to visit upon your part of the population some new violence, while he is in no condition to resist them, or take the least advantage of the contest that may ensue. He can display all the courage and spirit of one who is ready to perish for his rights; but I fear — to suffer — will be all that he can achieve. Do you not feel that it is so?” “I do believe it,” she answered. “It is my constant thought when alone; but the presence of my brother drives it away. Where he is I can only feel. I am never myself but by halves. Wisdom, I fear, I shall never reach.” “Wisdom, Anna, is not for so young as you. I am older by many years than you, yet I have not so much as come in sight of it. What I have now been saying, may sound very wise, but I know not if it be so. I can only say that I think as I do now. I pretend not to know. It is a new thing for me to be appealed to for counsel, who have hitherto been myself a dependant upon others.” “As I said these words, steps rapidly approached, and Philip entered the little building where we sat. His countenance expressed a mind disturbed and angry.” “How now, Philip,” said Anna, “what new evil have you to report with that ill-boding brow? Surely Pilate refuses not to hear us?” “No, my sister, it is not that, — but worse. Pilate refuses not to hear. But we refuse to be heard. Digest that.” “How, Philip, can that be? Was it not in full assembly of our people, that the five hundred were deputed once more to wait upon the Governor? Who can have revoked that decree but the people themselves? And they have not done it.” “The decree hath not been revoked, and the five hundred proceed this day to the judgment seat of Pilate, but with their tongues cut out and their hands bound.” “Speak not in riddles, Philip — what is it?” “It is true, Anna, as I have said, we go with our tongues out, and our hands bound. — Neither Simon, nor Eleazer is our mouth-piece, but — whom think you? Sylleus!” — “Our tongues are out indeed,” exclaimed his sister; “whose bad work has it been?” “Of all — save a sacred few. And now, may —” “Nay, Philip, swear not,” said Anna, and laid her hand across his mouth. He thrust it rudely from him, and again began his usual oath; but his affection for his sister obtained the mastery, and he suddenly paused, kissed her cheek, and asked her forgiveness. The kiss put to flight all her remaining resolutions of moderation, and changed her for the moment to but the counterpart of himself. “It might indeed, then,” she cried, “as well be that we were heard not at all. A Roman is as good a Jew as that unbelieving Sadducee — our Julian here were a better.” “Who, I pray you,” I then asked, “is this Sylleus that it so inflames you he should fill this office?” “Have you not heard of him?” said Philip. “But I forget you are but newly come to Cæsarea. Sylleus leads the Herodians; and what with their own numbers, and the faint-hearted among us of the stricter sort, it has been an easy victory to place him at the head of this embassy. I ought not in reason mayhap to VOL. I. 6 have looked for other issue than this. Yet I cannot but feel it, for it brings us bound hand and foot, to bide the will of Pilate. Peace, not truth and right, is the watch-word with these slaves with souls less in bigness than a grain of mustard-seed, or the point of a needle, who would, like their true ancestor, sell their birthright for a mess of pottage. Surely, now-a-days there can be no shame like that of being a Jew — apostates all — hypocrites and slaves.” So did he run on, full of violence till he had spent himself, and exhausted his stores of a proud and indignant passion. I could not but honor the feelings from which it all came, growing up, as they did, from that deep root of religious reverence, which, planted in his youth, had been duly nurtured, till it had spread throughout his whole nature, and drew everything to itself. Still I was sufficiently conscious that his was a virtue in its excess — in such excess that it was changed almost to a vice. His religion seemed to me little more, or better, than a blind and dangerous superstition. I dared to say to him a part of what I thought. I said, “that, according to my belief, he would gain more, by a more moderate course of action — that the laws of his own faith would be better observed, not to speak of a true policy, by conduct which should exhibit signs of patience and forbearance, and a willingness sometimes to yield a little, for the sake of peace; especially when so to yield was not to surrender anything that could be called a principle, or a point of faith; but was only bending for a time before the force of circumstances. I too would have him to be a Jew, and that not in name only, but in every act of his life, and purpose of his soul; but I would have him consider whether by a too violent and passionate demeanor, he did not, in truth, do a more treasonable act toward his religion and nation, than by one of more calmness. Pilate, surrounded by his soldiers, was not easily to be turned from his course, nor were the Greeks so few, or so weak, as to be deterred from what they had undertaken by any show of opposition, which, so far as I could judge, it was in the power of the Jews to make. It truly seemed to me, that for the present, at least, the affairs of his people would prosper more in the hands of Sylleus, than in those of Simon.” Philip listened as I spoke, and without those vehement exclamations of wonder or contempt, with which he is accustomed to interrupt those who utter opinions contrary to his own. But I could see by the fixed and grave expression of his countenance, no muscle moving, that he heeded, no more than the marble seat on which he sat, the words he had heard. “The Law,” said he, “given of God to our Fathers, is no human instrument, it is no fabric wrought by the hands of men to be altered at our pleasure, or winked out of sight at our will or convenience. It is the law of the God of Moses, and therefore wholly right, and to be obeyed and honored by those who receive it, in the spirit and in the letter, by the observance of its rites, by the keeping of its festivals, by the reverence of its Sabbaths, by the payment of its tythes — by the worship of him who founded it, and the hatred of those who would subvert it. The proper Jew is one who not only loves, but hates. The measure of contempt, that is by other nations served out to him, he returns heaped up and running over. The Jew's bond of allegiance to the Jew is not a more binding one, than that which leagues him in everlasting hatred against the gentile. Our ancestors, who with the besom of extermination and death swept the land of their inheritance of its accursed tribes, and spared neither the sucking child, nor the tender maid, nor the hoary head, are an example unto us of our day, how we should deal with any, who shall dare to set up their rest on the consecrated soil of this kingdom, not of man, but of God. “And even as he of old was but a traitor, an apostate, and a rebel, who held back his hand from the slaughter of the people whom God had devoted, — the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizite, even so is he who doth the same now. The idolatrous Canaanite of our day is the Roman and the Greek. The hand of God will ever be against us, till by the hand of those who love his law they be driven from the land, where their presence is as blasting and mildew. “I have waited, Roman, for such a day as this, and now it is come I hail it, and give God thanks. I dare not disobey the voice that sounds in my ear. As for Pilate and his legions, I care for them no more than for the chaff driven of the wind. I and the few who are with me may fall a sacrifice before that altar, on which the servants of the Most Hight have ever freely offered up themselves. But, if for the present — it will not always be in vain. Others, and other times shall reap the harvest.” “Such consequences may ensue,” I replied, “it cannot be gainsaid. The least events, so esteemed once, have proved nothing less than the corner stone of changes which have amazed the world. But no eye can discern the possibility of aught but suffering and death, in a revolt like this, without concert and without preparation. You will only furnish fresh victims to the cruelty of Pilate.” “For myself,” answered Philip, “I am ready 6 * to be a victim — I should not fall unhonored nor unavenged.” “But suppose, Philip, your fall should drag down also to the same ruin — mother and sister. There is little mercy, they say, in Pilate's heart.” Philip's stern countenance relaxed, and he gazed fondly upon Anna, who taking his hand and forgetful of everything but him, said, “let no fear, my brother, lest a little flower should perchance be trodden into the dust, lay restraint upon thy spirit. When God and Judea call, go on thy way, let perish what will that shall be under thy feet.” To say anything more I perceived to be worse than useless. We rose from our seats and in silence wound our way together to the house. At the ninth hour the deputation was to wait upon the governor. Philip soon left us to join his friends in their consultations; I did not accompany him, as he desired and urged me to do, but answered him I should be present at the hearing before the governor; in the mean time I should walk forth and observe the temper and behavior of the people. I accordingly took my way toward the principal part of the city which as yet I had scarcely seen. I was surprised, as I proceeded, by its extent, and the signs of wealth and taste even, in the forms of edifices, in the width of the streets, and the solidity of the pavements. The buildings of the city most remarkable for the costliness of their materials, for the observance of the best rules of Roman and Grecian art in their structure, for the grandeur of their parts, and the spaciousness of the grounds about them, are those which were erected by Herod the Great. As I have before said, I believe, they were built in too great haste to be built well, and there are everywhere to be discerned signs of weakness and decay; but they everywhere also give abundant evidence in their forms, proportions, and general elegance of design, that the mind that projected them had been well instructed in the best science of the capital of the world. Everything in a word is here Roman or Greek; nothing Jewish. Even the synagogues, although they are here as everywhere of peculiar form, indicating thereby to whom and what they belong, are yet both in the structure of the outer walls, of the inner porches, and the central edifice itself with its columns and roof, altogether conformable to the principles of Roman models. And truly, except the taste in such things had been borrowed from Rome, it is easy to believe there would have been but little to be witnessed among this people; for it must be confessed, my mother, that whatever portions of undoubted truth they may be in possession of, they are in other respects somewhat rude and barbarous. They possess, it cannot be denied, that which is most valuable; yet were it desirable also that they had added some of the graces and refinements of life, which give so real a beauty to the Italian and Grecian cities and provinces. A little while since and I should not have lamented this, though I might have noted it. Now I sincerely deplore it, as it tends to deprive them of the estimation among the rest of mankind which is justly their due. A virtuous man loses his power, if his countenance and manner wear not an accordant expression. And so truth methinks, religious as well as every other that is of worth, should be clothed with beauty. That can hardly be pure truth which shocks and offends by its ugliness. It is adulterate. But of all the edifices, which adorn the city, the Palace of Herod, and now the abode of our Governor, is the most conspicuous for its vastness and richness. It would not be mean in Rome. As I stood contemplating it, little heeding those in the street who were passing and repassing me, a voice at my side addressed me;— “I perceive, Sir, that you are a stranger by the manner in which you examine an object, which to us who dwell here is old and familiar. This magnificent structure we owe to the generosity and public spirit of the Great Herod; truly called the Great. He was too great to be hemmed in by the boundaries of Judaism; and though born a Hebrew aimed to be as much a Greek, and by Hercules, a Roman too, as well as a Greek. Pardon my freedom. But having little else to do, I am at your service to give you any information you may desire. I am thankful to him who can procure me occupation. Though dressed in the Roman fashion, yet, Sir, I perceive you are a Jew. But that need make no difference; I am a Greek, it is true, as you on your part may see; and you may suppose not unreasonably that I hold a Jew in small esteem, seeing how things go in Cæsarea; but, Sir, I consider man first — afterwards only whether he be Jew, Greek, or Roman. What think you?” I was so rejoiced that the noise he had made at length ceased, that, though inwardly I fear I used him hardly, I complimented him on the last sentiment he had uttered, and told him “I thought it worthy of a philosopher, which he seemed to be.” “Truly I flatter myself,” he replied, “I am somewhat of a lover of wisdom, but to say sooth, it is not always so easy to distinguish wisdom from folly, even as it is not so easy sometimes to know a philosopher from a fool. I aim at wisdom, but I often doubt whether I do not hit folly, and be not a fool.” I could not help thinking that he had arrived at one wise conclusion, and turned to depart; but he was not to be so easily shaken off; he followed, and continued to pour forth a stream of talk, by turns wise and absurd, but always rapid and noisy. He commented upon every building we passed remarkable for its beauty or its purpose, and named to me every citizen we met, Jew, or Greek, informing me as to his condition, affairs, office, or wealth. As we came before the devoted Synagogue in our walk, it furnished him with an inexhaustible theme. He said “that not Pilate himself knew better what would happen than he. Nay, not so well; for Pilate knows not at once his own mind; but the Greeks know theirs, and that it will be no impossible thing to force it upon the Governor. And before a few days are passed, Sir, these walls will lie level with the pavement. This cannot be agreeable to you Jews. It is always an evil to belong to the weaker party; but then you know the philosophic virtue of submission to what is inevitable. I trust your people will manifest their wisdom in a timely and politic acquiescence.” I asked my unavoidable companion, how he could feel so sure of Pilate's determination, especially as he was to hear the Jews again to day, by some of their people who were more inclined to accommodation. “Human nature, Sir, human nature,” — was his reply; “who knows not the Greeks? and who knows not Pilate? Prophecy is often nothing more than a shrewd judgment. The wise know what shall come to pass, from what already is, and has been. I confess, I see everything that shall be these few coming days with the same plainness as if it had already happened. There will be sad uproar, believe me.” I said, “I hoped not.” “Ah yes,” he rejoined, “it is a good thing to hope; but one hopes less as he grows older and wiser. I know a few things, but I hope in nothing. — A fair day to you, most worthy Cataphilus,” cried my companion suddenly to one who passed, gaily and richly dressed, “How is it with your great master to day? I trust he is in health.” “He is well,” replied the other, “but he is closely shut up with despatches from the Emperor — Excuse my haste” — my companion was about to lay hold upon a fold of his robe — “I will say that Zeno inquired for his welfare;” and forced himself away. — “That man,” said my new friend, “is ever in a hurry; he is, you must be informed, Pilate's chief steward, and knows many things, if one could but get them out. But it is just so with all in this noisy place. I can scarce find a man who will allow me more than a few words, ere he must perforce be off to keep some appointment. It was not so in Athens. There, one could find a few who would give you an hour or so in the markets, or at the corner of a street, or at the bath. But here, great Jupiter, I surely deem that a pot of Tyrian dye, or a bale of Egyptian cotton is held to be of more value than would be a discourse from Plato, and a merchant more honored than a philosopher. But that Cataphilus, whom we just met, as I was saying, he has a master, and that master is Pilate, and Pilate has a master, who is Tiberius. Those despatches from Rome, I trow, give him some trouble. He stands, I doubt, on slippery ground. But this in your ear. We Greeks make use of him, but we esteem him not any more than you Jews. Now, my young Hebrew, we approach the market, and a sight it is, I assure you; there behold! That too was the work of Herod. Few things in Athens are finer.” It was a noble structure indeed; and the whole scene was imposing and grand, owing both to the buildings and the crowds of people who thronged the streets and squares. We stood where we had paused, observing and admiring, till being too much jostled and incommoded by the swift moving currents of passengers, we withdrew a few paces to the steps of a portico, where we could see and converse without interruption. As we thus stood here, and Zeno enlarged with volubility upon the various objects before us, our attention was suddenly arrested by the loud tone of a voice commencing its prayers in the Hebrew tongue. I turned to the quarter whence the sound proceeded, and just within an arch of the Portico hardly separated from the street, there stood a Jew with face uplifted, and hands spread out, uttering at the top of his voice his noon-day prayers; his eyes were so turned up as to give him the appearance of one in an agony, and his voice seemed to come forth from the passages of his nose rather than from those of the mouth. So distorted was his whole countenance by the sanctimonious expression he had assumed, that I did not at first recognise my companion on board the vessel. But as soon as I had made the discovery, I asked the Greek, who the person might be who was so diligent and noisy at his devotions. Zeno was amazed at my ignorance. VOL. I. 7 “What,” said he, “hast thou been but a day in Cæsarea, and hast thou not heard of Ben-Ezra, the holiest Jew in all the city, the very head of the Pharisees, and with the common people of more sway than either Simon or Eleazer? Daily as the shadow of yonder dial falls upon the sixth hour, may this trumpet tongue be heard in the market of Cæsarea; a proclamation of holy zeal to the fools who cannot see, though they have eyes — of false and vain pretence to those who know how to use the eyes God has given them. See, his worshippers are gathering to listen. Such prayers never reach the gods. Perhaps it is not meant they should. They are answered in the effect they have upon these asses who are crowding round with their long ears erect. Let us away. This voice puts to flight my philosophy.” So we passed on and mingled in the thickest of the throng of buyers and sellers — now in greater multitudes than usual, owing to the games. With almost all the affair of the synagogue was the subject of conjecture or dispute; and from very few did I hear a word of encouragement for the poor Jew. All sorts of opprobrious language was poured forth upon our unhappy people, and prophecies freely uttered of the destruction of the building before a few more days should pass. “You see how it is, my little Jew,” cried Zeno, as we turned away from some of these, “there is no hope for you. The gods have decreed your defeat, and you are defeated. Better trouble thyself no more about it. Accompany me to the Amphitheatre to view the preparations that are going on, and leave your bewildered countrymen to Pilate. Be assured he will take care of them.” I made him comprehend at length, after repeated attempts to avert the flow of his Greek, that I was too much interested in the fate of my countrymen and friends to be absent on such an occasion. He took leave of me with reluctance, but not till he had learned where and with whom I dwelt, and had promised to bestow upon me more of his company. I returned to the house of Sameas. Anna and her mother I found employed in domestic affairs; wherefore I withdrew to my apartment, and gave myself even a higher pleasure than their society could have imparted, by conversing through my pen with you, my mother. But the time has come when it behoves me to repair to the Hall of Pilate, that I may not lose what shall there take place between the Greek and the Jew before the Roman Judge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III. The scene has passed; and I am again returned to my apartment and my tablets, to describe to you all that has happened. The Hall of Judgment, as the Cæsareans term that building, where the Roman Governor hears and judges those causes which come before him, stands not far from the palace of Herod, and, indeed, although it faces in an opposite direction, and is separated apparently from it, is yet connected with it by covered and secret passages, so that communication can be quickly made from one to the other. Pilate, they say here, being ever fearful lest some revenge, either public or private, should be taken upon him for his violences committed against communities or individuals, contrived these and divers other secret methods of escape from one building to another, and from one part of the city to another. The building is not, however, like the palace, of marble, and of the like elegance in its design and ornaments; it is, on the other hand, constructed of a dark and gloomy stone, and though grand in its form and proportions, cannot boast of what is properly termed beautiful. As I now drew near, I perceived that on all sides it was encompassed by crowds of people, waiting for the coming of the Jews, and what was to follow. The whole city seemed to have come together into one place. I was apprehensive lest owing to the multitude I should find it impossible to force myself within the building; for it appeared to me certain, that if so many were without, the space within must be more than filled. I thought it hardly worth my while to proceed, and had paused, that I might, at least, perhaps, by remaining where I was, witness the approach of the Jews, and the manner in which they would be received by so great a concourse of citizens, when I was suddenly saluted by the philosopher Zeno, from whom I had been parted but for a short time. He had evidently, by too fast walking, lost his breath, for he could utter himself only, as it were, piece-meal — a great evil to one whose usual speech is like the running of a wine cask. “How now, my Jew of Rome,” cried he, “how think you your friends are to come up with you at your rate of walking? He who ran for help from Athens to Lacedæmon — Phi —” 7* “Phidippides.” “Ah, that is it — Phidippides — Phidippides ran not so fast. It is well you halted as you did, else had you lost my salutation and my company.” “Your company,” said I, “I fear still I must lose; for owing to the numbers who are pressing into this narrow space, and are already in advance of me, I have resolved to return whence I came, though I shall miss much that I had hoped to witness.” “Now shalt thou acknowledge, Jew,” cried he, “that there is, for once, use and virtue in a Greek. Follow me; and though thou shalt not get on at the pace of Phidippides, we shall arrive soon enough. So lay hold of my gown and come on. There is not a blind alley, or a covered way, or a secret entrance in Cæsarea that 's not known to me, which is one advantage that accrueth as a consequence of having nothing to do.” So saying, he led the way, and threading his passage among the throngs, at length emerged into a bye way wholly clear of the populace. — Passing through this, I perceived that we had approached very near to the rear of the principal building; then, by now descending, and again ascending, enveloped now in darkness, then suddenly coming again to the light, meeting and seeing but few, and those apparently officials of the place, who all smiled and nodded to my companion as knowing him well, we came forth, at length, upon the broad paved area of the chief entrance; when, ascending a magnificent flight of steps, crowded with others rapidly moving in the same direction, we soon stood within the walls of the Judgment Hall more properly so called, being the vast apartment in which Pilate sits to hear whatever causes may be brought before him. With the knowledge of one who is familiar with such places, Zeno, immediately upon gaining the floor, pointed to the spot where we could both hear and see to the greatest advantage, and which none as yet had seized upon. Whereupon, we without delay secured it. “These people,” said Zeno, “though now apparently so quiet and peaceable, yet require not much to be said or done, to throw them into a ferment of passion, and mingle them in bitter fight. The Greeks have bound themselves together by oaths, not to forego their end, if it can be gained by any means which are within their reach. They are too many for you Jews, even though you were all of one mind; but as I hear and know, you are divided into parties which are little less hostile toward each other, than any or all of you are toward the Greeks. This will make their victory easy. Pilate, too, is with them.” Zeno was interrupted in his talk, which flows otherwise with a perpetual stream, by the stir occasioned by the approach and entrance of the deputation of the Jews. Their priests came at their head, clothed in the usual garments of the service, followed by Sylleus and those of the Herodians who had been selected to accompany and support him. It was among those who entered last, that I observed Philip, Simon, and Eleazer. Immediately upon this, Pilate, from an opposite entrance, made his appearance, and advanced to his chair of state, on either side of which were ranged his friends, the officers of his household, his secretaries, heralds, and soldiers. The aspect of this man is cold and dark. His countenance is bloodless, his eyes restless, near together, and set deep beneath his brows, which are straight and black. The features are very fixed, and more as if they were made of stone than of flesh. He neither smiles, nor gives evidence, on the surface, of any other emotion, either agreeable or painful; but maintains one rigid sameness of expression, except that at times a shadow so deep as to seem cast by an external object, but in truth proceeding from some terrible inward commotion lends to his face the darkness and terrors of night and death. He appears, for the most part, like one withdrawn from what is immediately before him, and brooding in secret upon some deep design. This appearance I may have seen in him, indeed, from first knowing his character; which for a selfish rapacity, and a heartless disregard of the rights and the lives of those who come within his power, has made him to be noted, not only here in the East, but at Rome also. I thought him to be one, as I observed him, into whose hands I should unwillingly fall; who would not, perhaps, indeed, injure or slay so much from feelings of wanton cruelty, as from a cold indifference to the life of another; just as there are those who will not, truly, go out of their way to crush an insect, but will not turn aside the breadth of a hair, if one should perchance lie in their path; and those who, if through some error, they have been the cause of innocent lives being destroyed will enjoy none the less their next hour's rest, or their next cup of wine. This also appeared to be the truth as to his character, from what, at this audience, I was able to observe. No sooner had he taken his seat and looked round upon the suppliants before him, than he said with abruptness; “Why is it that again, with a strange and foolish obstinacy, Jews of Cæsarea, ye seek my judgment seat? Do you think to change my mind, by this new embassy? Think you to gain anything by setting the whole city in an uproar? Who speaks for you?” One of the priests replied, “Sylleus, noble Governor, the Herodian Sylleus is set to plead for us.” “Why not the Roman Sylleus? Methinks it became you more to have among you a sect of Romans than of Herodians. Belonging to Rome, it were well that some of you, at least, bore the name.” “The name comes not,” replied humbly the same priest, “chiefly from Antipas of Galilee, but as much from his great father.” “Ah, well, that is better. There were little honor in coming of him of Galilee. Where is this Sylleus? let him say on, and let him be brief. A cause heard twice, may be heard quickly. Let Sylleus the Herodian declare himself.” Whereupon Sylleus rose, and stood before Pilate; and after much fawning, and a long exordium of swollen flatteries, he was about to enter upon somewhat more pertinent, when Pilate's impatience broke forth in a stern rebuke; — “Cease, Sylleus, to praise. We are Governor here in Cæsarea, we know; and the right arm of Cæsar. Tell us not of that with which we are already well acquainted, but come at once to the matter in hand.” “Most noble Pilate,” then began Sylleus again, “we are fain to seek thy great presence once more, for that we are well convinced, that when before we stood in this place, the people of the Jews, who are ever desirous to demean themselves as good citizens, were not represented by those who could or would make known to you the real sentiments of devotion to Cæsar, which fill the bosoms of our nation generally, and more especially of the inhabitants of this great Capital. They spake, so we judge, not so much as suitors for a favor, as after the manner of those who stood to enforce what they wished. Verily, their words were more those of the foes, than the friends of Rome. They spake too sharply of their rights, and of Rome's duty to her far off provinces, whom, said they, she is bound to protect, and defend against aggression, specially when aimed at their religion, which it hath ever been the custom of Rome to respect and secure to her subjects. Whatever truth, noble Pilate, there may be in such things, we name them not, but rather come pleading our friendship and affection for Rome, and asking to be held by her as lovers and children. It was the Great Herod who first taught our people to seek their country's prosperity no longer, in separating themselves so far from others in their manners, laws, and worship, but in mingling with the people of every nation, and adopting with freedom whatever was seen to be excellent in their various modes of life; and especially to make these interchanges with those who are the masters and the model of the whole world. It is well known to you, with what success he drew almost the whole nation after him; but particularly those who dwelt upon the sea-coast; so that in the process of not many years, the customs and manners of Rome were to be seen in a great many of our cities, and nowhere more than in Cæsarea; so that even the games and sports of the Circus and the Theatres were to be enjoyed in many places, in Cæsarea, Herodium, Gamala, Machærus, without the necessity of a voyage to Rome; and so that even our religion, for adhering to which with devotion, we have been famous through all history, we began to think might relax somewhat of its harshness, and receive somewhat of the milder spirit which marks the faith of Rome. Receive it, then, O Pilate, as a truth not to be gainsaid, that we, who live now, are more pervaded by this leaven, as many do call it, of Herod, than were those who lived but a little while before us; to that degree indeed, that, save in some few respects of little moment, the Jew of Cæsarea may, without impeaching greatly one's powers of discernment, be taken for a Roman. His garb is the same, his language the same, his amusements the same; and what separates him, is indeed but little worthy of regard. Now, most excellent Governor, if the Jews of Cæsarea be such, why should they not be dealt with as friends, subjects, citizens, and children of the Universal Empire? We see not why a synagogue of the Jews should be razed for this purpose, any more than a temple of Jupiter or Apollo. We will not yield to any in our love and honor of Rome. Condescend, great Prince, to consider this, our great affection and to grant our suit. And now —” Pilate interrupted him; “That is well said, Sylleus. Thou hast done well, and said enough. I doubt not now your love for Rome. But answer me this — are you not still Jews? Call you not yourselves Jews?” “Assuredly we do,” responded Sylleus. “Ah, hah,” said Pilate, “then are you not Romans. A Jew is a Jew. A circumcised Jew can be no Roman.” And upon that the Greeks and the rabble laughed. Pilate, as VOL. I. 8 this subsided, continued, in a sharp and bitter tone.— “You Jews are surely a short-sighted, besotted people. What cares Rome, think you, for your good will? Shall she owe you thanks and favors, that you affect her, and honor her? She owes not these to her own citizens and children. What she wants, by the Gods, she can command; her arm is long enough and strong enough to reach even to you, and what she would have you, that shall she make you. — What more would you say? Speak, for time presses, and the air grows hot.” Sylleus thus urged, and finding, doubtless, that much of the argument he had prepared could not so much as be uttered in the ears of the Governor, much less set forth in order with his usual flourishes, came, at length, after much hesitating, and a long and indirect preface — in which he was more than once interrupted and rebuked by the Procurator — to the statement of the proposition which he had been directed to reserve to the last. “The Jews of Cæsarea,” he began, “as is well known to your Greatness, and, indeed, to all the world, are a poor people, and what little wealth they can heap together is obtained by a labor, and by hardships and industry, such, it is believed, as the natives of no other land ever present an example of. And if Cæsarea is poor, so too is Jerusalem — Judea, and Galilee, and Perea, it is all the same; we are a small and poor people. Yet, according to our ability, are we willing to part with our hard-earned gains, if, in exchange, we can obtain privileges and favors which to us are more than wealth.” Pilate raised his head, and looked at Sylleus. Zeno remarked that, in his judgment, for a Jew, Sylleus was a man of discernment. “Especially,” he continued, “does it gratify us, who, as I have before aimed to show, love Rome even as her own children, when we can offer our mite to increase the lustre of her greatness. Nay, it were not reason that we looked to obtain at all times that which we covet, without some sacrifice on our part, or some relinquishment of what we value in due proportion to what we receive.” “You surely judge,” said Pilate, “like good citizens and honest men.” “Wherefore, most noble Governor,” continued Sylleus, “it is through the counsel of our chief priests and the other most esteemed persons of our body, that I now say, that to ransom what is so dearly prized by Jewish hearts, we gladly offer to the treasury of the Empire a gold talent of Jerusalem, which, though it may seem but a small sum to those who hold in their hands the wealth of the whole earth, is yet a huge one to those who, as we do, acquire our riches, if we may ever be said to possess riches, by little and little, and never much.” An evident sensation was made throughout the crowd by this proposition of the Jew. It had not been looked for. I asked Zeno if this was the way in which Rome raised taxes. “Little of money so got, ever goes to Rome,” he replied. “This is for the purse of Pilate. The Jew has touched the right chord, and it sings music in the Governor's ear. He is thinking of bracelets and ear-rings for his wife, the beautiful Procla. See, he smiles graciously on Sylleus, and seems not to catch the murmurs from the Greeks. If he heeds them not, I warrant him they will soon grow louder than he will like.” Pilate, for the moment while this was said, sat silent and unobservant of all around him, then suddenly broke out, — “Thou hast said the truth, Sylleus. Rome loves her distant subjects as her nearer, and ever accepts with pride the tokens of their regard.” He was about to proceed with other things, when he was interrupted by a loud and clear voice, which I at once recognised as Philip's. “Listen not, O Governor, to the words of one who, in every word he utters, seals the dishonor of his country” — But Philip was in his turn, rudely silenced, at Pilate's instance, by a herald who stood near; for at the same moment he had observed that Lycias, the leader of the Greeks, wished to address him. Many of the Jews now cried out for Philip, others for Sylleus, and the Greeks shouted the names of Lycias and Philæus, each party striving, by noise and uproar, to secure the success of its chief. Pilate at length succeeded in enforcing silence, and then called upon Lycias to say what he would. “Most noble Governor,” said the Greek, as soon as his voice could be made to prevail over the slowly subsiding tumult, “it is a long time that the honor, which the united Greek population of Cæsarea have proposed to render to the reigning Emperor, hath been made a matter of notoriety, both here in our city, and in the neighboring places. Even at Rome, it hath been familiarly spoken of by such as are acquainted with our affairs and been carried to the ears of Cæsar himself. It hath been also reported to Cæsar, that the imperial colossus should stand upon the loftiest point of the city — now filled by the Jewish synagogue — so that it might be conspicuous to all entering or departing 8* from the Port, and to such as travel the great roads to the Capital, as those of Asia and Rome now are; and more than this, that the ground hath already been ceded to the Greeks for this use by the Governor. To me and to us, is it plain, O Pilate, that the honor arising from this act on the part of the Greeks of Cæsarea, will be more esteemed at Rome, than will be the miserable pittance proffered by the Jews, which can hardly be thought to be equivalent to more than half the value of the building now deforming the finest quarter of the city. He can scarce be reckoned a friend of Cæsar, and of Cæsar's honor, who, for a colossus of marble upon the topmost point of Cæsarea, shall substitute a talent of gold, which, while it vanishes in the using, the other endures with nature itself, from one part of which it is carved out. If the omnipotent Tiberius be in want of money, let the Greeks of Cæsarea make a contribution of such pence as they can spare, and by the first ship despatch it to Rome.” Here was there much commotion amongst the multitude — the Greeks exulting, and the Jews showing signs of rage and impatience — Pilate's pallid face grew whiter still. Zeno said, “That Greek is bold, is he not? But were he not sure how it stands with Pilate at Rome, he might as well have cut off his own head, as said it. Trust Lycias for both courage and cunning.” Lycias was about to begin again, when Pilate, assuming his usual air, and rising, said, “I will hear no more of the matter. What I have decreed, I have decreed. The first judgment shall stand. I was willing to grant an indulgence to you, Jews of Cæsarea, and to hear what further ye might have to allege against the Judgment I had rendered; but it has proved but another occasion of tumult and confusion —” Pilate was here broken in upon by the loud voice of Philip — “The true reasons,” said he, “O Pilate, why thy judgment should not stand, have not been rendered by the false Sylleus; listen to me, and thou shalt hear them —” A new uproar was now occasioned. The Priests, with signs of rage in their distorted countenances, shouted, “Hear him not, Pilate, he is mad! The Jews themselves hold him mad.” The Greeks, too, now took sides with them in the endeavor to silence him, but his voice prevailed over all. “The true reason, O Pilate, why this judgment should not be rendered is, that it will breed riot, revolt, and war, in Cæsarea, and it may be, throughout Judea. Deem not that though some of the Jews be traitors to themselves and their God, all are therefore so. For I say unto thee, there are those in Cæsarea, and they are not a few, who will sooner pour out their blood upon the altar of their God, as did those Galileans whom thou doubtless rememberest, or ever they will see dishonor done to the house of their worship. Believe not the foul-mouthed apostate, when he tells thee that there is love between us and thee, between Israel and Rome. I tell thee there is hate — deep, deadly, inextinguishable hate, and there is nothing else. The Jew hates the Roman, defies and spits upon him. Herod did not quite, although he did almost, un-Jew us. There be some left who name not his name, but another's who lived long since, of whom, perchance, the noble Pilate has heard somewhat, Judas of Galilee! And besides him and much more, Herod Antipas, whom thou lovest not; we hold from him, and hope, helped by the God of our fathers, that he shall do a work of which the world shall hear. There is a cup in His hand, and the wine is red, and as for the dregs thereof, ye of Rome shall wring them out and drink them.” — What more Philip would have said none can tell, for at that moment Pilate's voice was heard — “Strike him to the ground! Hew down the rebel” — at which the soldiers, who were near, made towards him as they could through the press, but happily in vain; for the Jews who were around him closed him in, many of the other party joining them, and in spite of the efforts of the soldiers, whose swords and spears were flashing around and falling mercilessly upon any who were nearest — they love nothing like the blood of a Jew — Philip was thrust into the thickest of the multitude, and so escaped. But the words of Pilate were the signal for a general tumult. The whole mass, heaved to and fro in the struggles of all, either to defend themselves, to assail others, or to escape from the Hall; the confusion and the terror being increased by the stern command of Pilate, heard above all the din, for the legionaries to be drawn from the Camp to the Square, he himself at the same moment hastily disappearing through the door in the rear of the apartment, by which he had entered. The throng being now too dense to permit the use of weapons, every thought and effort of each was centered in the endeavor to fly from the place, and in the haste and hurry thus occasioned, many, both of the Greeks and Jews, were thrown down and trampled to death, in the narrow passages, and on the descent of the steps. When the streets were once gained, the apprehension of the Roman soldiery caused the crowds, with precipitation, to fly for the shelter of their homes. As for ourselves, Zeno, when he saw to what head the tumult would grow, with a prudence which is a part of his character, drew me away with haste to the near neighborhood of the entrance by which we had gained the room, so that when the tumult had reached its highest, and no more was to be witnessed with safety, we departed the way we came; many who were near us, observing our movements, and escaping by the same means. As we rapidly made our way through the narrow and secret passes, by which we had approached the Judgment Hall, the air was filled with the noise of the retreating and flying crowds, and soon, above all, was heard the clang of the trumpets of the Roman Horse, as yet at a distance, they swept along the streets toward the scene of action. So great, however, was the terror on the part of the people of this weapon of Imperial rule, that by the time the Horse had reached the Hall, they found themselves the sole occupants of the square and the streets, a moment before so thronged with half the inhabitants of Cæsarea. I soon parted from Zeno, and hastened to what I already begin to call my home. Anna and her mother were awaiting with anxiety the event of the audience. I had scarcely ended my narrative of the occurrences of the hour, when Philip appeared. He was now calm, but bore marks, in the fiery glow of his countenance, of the scenes through which he had just passed. Although he conversed with moderation, and with gentleness toward us all, yet was there a wildness and restless wandering of the eye, which showed to me that his soul was deeply agitated, and was still devising further schemes of resistance. Anna, after having heard from both of us full accounts of all that had happened, no longer made any effort to restrain herself or Philip, but surrendered herself to the undivided dominion of her religious, patriotic zeal, and by the lofty tone of her indignation, and her sincere devotion to her faith, served to lend a fresh impulse to her brother. Where this will end, or what will next ensue, I cannot pretend to divine; but the causes of discord and quarrel are too many, and now too bitter, to be speedily put at rest. I cannot wonder, my mother, at the rage into which devout Jews are thrown, or any who retain the least attachment to their country, and reverence for those who have lived before them, or any remembrance of their ancient greatness and renown, nay, who have any proper feeling for themselves, when they behold themselves, the lives of their children, their homes, the prosperity of their cities, and the religion which they have received through so many ages, made the sport of a tyranny like this. Rome at home is compassionate and indulgent — at least, magnanimous; but in her distant administration of the extremities of her vast Empire, where her own eye cannot penetrate, she is, through her ministers, oftentimes most unjust and oppressive. Pilate, as I learn, and as I see, rules in Judea, not for the good of the province over which he is set, but for his own. His first care is to turn the streams of wealth, of which he can obtain the control, into his own coffers — next into those of Rome; and whenever his own wants of more, and still more, cry out louder than usual, or the cry comes over the sea from his great master, then pretexts in abundance are found, or invented, for extraordinary assessments upon the people, and to that degree, that ruin to the merchant and the husbandman often stalks in the footsteps of the publican. Nay, among the Jews, those who lend themselves to this service, and for the sake of a livelihood, or possibly larger gains, allow themselves to be employed as collectors of these imposed burdens, are held in even greater abhorrence than the masters whom they serve. That toward both, all the anger and hate should be felt which now rage in the breast of Philip, and of those who are with him, is natural and necessary; and I blame Philip, therefore, not for his principles, but for his policy. He surrenders himself wholly to his passions, which bear him apparently with more despatch toward the attainment of his object, but deceive him, and end in leading him farther and farther from that at which he aims. He, who obeys his passions rather than his reason, is like one who, on the ocean, should hope to reach the port, trusting to the winds alone. They may drive him swiftly; but if there be no rudder and no helmsman, the faster he shall go, the farther it may be from the haven he seeks. After a stormy day, I now willingly seek repose. To-morrow the games of Herod commence, and it will not be strange if disturbances should again break out. When it shall have passed, I will record its events. The day has come and gone in peace. I will not, my mother describe the scenes I have witnessed at the Amphitheatre, resembling as they have, even to the minutest ceremonial, those of the same kind in Rome, of which you have often heard, though you never witnessed them. To thine apostate son was left that office; and faithfully were its duties fulfilled. VOL. I. 9 Never, as I think, was I absent after my tenth year, from any game or show within the walls of Rome — or never, except when my old master Plancus used to interpose, out of regard, as he averred, to my progress in my studies, and obtain from you, or from my father, an interdict to be laid upon my movements. With my father, I believe, he rarely succeeded, he being ever ambitious, that, by mingling, at all times and in every place, with the Roman youth, especially at their national sports and public games, I should grow up in their likeness, and lose my own. It was to you I owe it, that occasionally I was withheld from such scenes, and kept, instead, to my Greek. But my relish for them I find not to be quite dead within me; even on the humbler scale in which they were to-day exhibited in this provincial city. And truly I was not the only son of Abraham then and there present, but beside me, as it were, the whole Jewish population of Cæsarea — so successful have been the means resorted to, to tempt our people to adopt the customs and manners of their conquerors and masters. The more strict, indeed, were not there, such as Anna, Philip, Simon, and their friends; but they are few in comparison with the whole. On the third day of the games occurs the Sabbath, when many more will be added to the numbers of the absent; but so fatal is the power of bad example, great numbers will also be found in the seats of the Theatre — amongst whom, alas, thy son may be. On the evening of the first day — as I was but now about to say — we sat together in the Portico, looking both over the garden, and the waters of the sea, as they then sparkled under the light of the half-grown moon. Our talk was of the games, and of what had been witnessed there. I related all I had either seen or heard. Simon also was of our company; who asked me whether any difference was to be noted in the demeanor of Pilate toward the Greeks and Jews. I told him I had noticed none; or if any, that his manner was even more gracious towards those of the Jews who were near him than to any others, and what was more perhaps, that at the side of Procla sat the wife of Sylleus. “There is no good designed,” said Simon, “in any quarter, when Pilate smiles; least of all, to us. Would that his wife reigned here in Judea, instead of him. Her smiles, and they are many, are of the heart. Were her counsels followed, there were no uncertain prospect of days of peace in Judea. She is full of humanity, as he of cruelty. Toward our people she has ever shown herself prompt to do them favors, and atone, as she might, for the slights and affronts of her husband and other lordly Romans. The Lord be nigh unto her in the hour of her necessity.” “Often has she been known,” said Anna, “to interpose between the judgment of Pilate and his victim, — believed by her to be unjustly condemned, — and snatch him from the death that threatened; and sometimes has she herself in the silence of night set open the prison door, and unlocked the chain, and set the prisoner free, trusting to Pilate's love of her, — which all Cæsarea knows how fond it is, — to overlook the offence. Her heart is full of pity, and even the Jew is not shut out.” “He is not,” said Simon; “to day at the Synagogue and in the Market it passed from mouth to mouth, that Procla was on our part, and that to the wife of Sylleus she had declared as much, and had said moreover, that whatever it lay within her power to do, that would she do gladly for the furtherance of our desires. The peace with which this day has passed gives hope that justice and milder counsels will prevail.” “It is,” said Philip, “the treacherous calm that precedes the tempest; the smoothness of the stream before it shoots the precipice; the stillness that comes before the lightning; the quiet speech of Joab when he smote Abner under the fifth rib. Look not for peace till the yoke of slavery shall have been fastened upon the neck of every man, who dares to stand up and call himself a Jew. Procla's intercession may buy the life of a malefactor, or save a thief from the stocks, but at a time like this her smiles would scarce avail to change the mind of Pilate. His love of money and his dread of Cæsar are stronger both, than his love of Procla. 'T is rumored, that the Greeks more than make good the bribe of Sylleus.” “Still,” said Simon, “I will hope the best. If to-morrow shall also go over, and our temple still keep its place, I will believe that the Lord hath turned the heart of our enemy. For it is Pilate's wont not to delay what he purposes.” I could not help saying here, what I did not doubt was the truth, that it was not to be questioned that Pilate would carry into effect his purpose sooner or later; he might not do it to-morrow or the day after, but as there was no power to prevent him, and there was a strong motive for him to do the Greeks this favor, he would neither pause nor hesitate in the work before him. This was, as I learned at the Amphitheatre, the opinion of all who were most capable of judging, who knew Pilate well, and 9 * were interested in the event neither one way nor another. And I added, that I could not but hope, that, whatever iniquity there might be in the measure, it would not be resisted, but that afterward, since it could not be done before, an appeal would be made to Cæsar. However, all I could say was of little weight with any, except perhaps with Simon, who judges now more calmly in the matter than at first. As for Philip he declared if all deserted him, as most seemed likely to do, he would fall alone under the axes and engines, ere he would live to witness the impious wrong. Anna was of the same mind. Ceasing then to converse upon themes, which were sure to agitate all who engaged in them, we walked forth into the garden and spoke of other things, and lingered till a late hour among its avenues and shades. It was not till the sounds in the neighboring streets had died away, and the confused murmur that came up from the vicinity of the Amphitheatre, where idle revellers and the more dissolute youth of the city pass both day and night, had at length grown so faint as scarcely to be heard, that we were warned to our rest. The second day of the games has come and gone in like manner as the first. But there are, as it seems to me, many indications that another will not pass so quietly. At the Circus the affair of the Synagogue in all the intervals of the games was, as it were, the sole topic of discourse. Some, both of Greeks and Jews, espousing one side, and some another; for many of the Greeks are generous enough to condemn the measures which have been urged upon Pilate, and many of the Jews, on the other hand, are base enough through subserviency to the Roman power to defend him, and throw blame upon the churlishness, as they term it, of the zealous, who will listen to no propositions of surrender. Zeno, who, with his troublesome partiality for my conversation, was not long in perceiving in what part of the Theatre I had placed myself, soon joined me, “that he might enliven,” as he was pleased to say, “by his presence and discourse, the solitude in which I seemed to be pining.” I asked him, how in his judgment stood the affair of the Jews; for however this man may render himself both tedious and absurd, by the perserverance of his friendship, and the manner of his talk, it still is universally admitted in Cæsarea, that no other individual is during any one day in so many different places, sees so many persons, hears so much news, and heaps together so many facts; so that to no other source of information could I apply with so great a certainty of obtaining the knowledge for which I sought. He was very positive in his belief, in reply to my inquiries, that Pilate held to his original purpose, and that nothing now could turn him from it; that the second hearing of the Jews had done them more harm than good; that Philip had enraged him, and that he would now in spite of appearances soon take his revenge. I told him, that I thought Lycias had said more to offend than Philip. This he admitted; but replied, that it was for Pilate's interest, nay it was necessary to him, to overlook that; and besides he attributed the whole disturbance, into which Cæsarea had been thrown, to what he calls the superstitious obstinacy of the Jews. “To-morrow is your Sabbath, and to-morrow will the measure be carried into effect,” said Zeno; “I doubt this no more than that Pilate sits there before us toying with Procla's bracelets, and now turns his dark brows to watch the last agonies of that dying gladiator. He reckons much upon the Herodians — which, some say, but for mysterious reasons which I do not understand, is a false reliance — and the divisions among you; and is persuaded that there will now be but faint opposition, and that on the part only of a few madmen like Philip.” Philip throughout this day has been engaged in secret movements with his party. It is their purpose to post themselves in the immediate neighborhood of the Synagogue, concealed in the dwellings of the Jews which are nearest. Many of these are inhabited by Roman Jews, who would not admit Philip, nor any of his adherents. But an equal or a greater number are in the possession of those who are united with him. These buildings are separated from the walls of the Synagogue by very broad streets, and almost surround it, and afford a ready and secure place of concealment, while awaiting the decision of Pilate; and of retreat, if either their own desperate zeal, or the Roman sword should spare them for such an act. There can be little question but that to-morrow will behold the destruction of the Synagogue. Although no public order has been given, and the people will be tempted to the Theatre by unusual spectacles; yet those who know the manner in which Pilate conducts such affairs are well persuaded of it. Lest, my mother, the events of another day should not allow me to end and seal this letter, and commit it to the vessel which to-morrow sails for the Tiber, I will close it now, commending myself to you with all love, and offering the salutations of the widow and her daughter. When the morrow is over, I will write of its events.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV. That morrow is past. Its sun has gone down in darkness. I keep my promise, my mother, and at once tell you of its scenes and events. It was, as I have said, the Sabbath. In the household of Sameas the observances were as with those of the stricter sort in Rome, except that Philip was early abroad attending to the affairs committed to him. Anna and her mother repaired to the Synagogue. As they were departing, Anna turned to me and said, “will you not, Julian, go with us?” I said that I could not; my anxieties were too many to allow me to worship, and I did not choose to be present with my body alone. She said that my answer had rebuked her, for she was sure she should think only of Philip. “If,” said her mother, “you will not only think of Philip, but lift up your prayers for him, how, my child, could you be more devoutly employed?” “That is true,” replied the daughter, “let us go, and pray for Philip and for Judea. Farewell, Julian, go not to the games.” And with these words, the last which I heard from her, she turned away and moved in the direction of the Synagogue. Not long after their departure, I too sought the streets, uncertain whether to bend my way toward the Amphitheatre, or toward the Synagogue, which, whether I should enter it or not as a worshipper, certainly had all my thoughts. I was determined, as men ever are, by the multitude; and them I found all hurrying toward the Circus. The city seemed emptying in that direction, so great were the numbers of persons on foot and in chariots, on camels and on horses, many being from the country round about, who were thus hastening in the pursuit of pleasure. I, without will or purpose of my own, was borne along with the current. The expectations, as I conversed first with one and then with another of those who were going the same way, were great as to the entertainment to be afforded. “It was to be the great day of the games. It was announced,” said they, “as I might see for myself on the corners of all the streets, that an hundred Lions were to contend with one another, with other beasts, or with men. That was but a part of the show. There were other things greater yet. Pilate had never before, on his part, made so great provision for the amusement of the people. Old men said it brought to mind the days of Herod.” But long before I reached the plain on the outskirts of the city, where stands the Circus, I turned round, and moved in another direction, giving myself up to my meditations thinking now of you, my mother, then of my journey to Beth-Harem, and most of all, of Philip and his sister. So I kept on my way, I know not how long, till suddenly the sounds of our Sabbath music struck my ear. The street were now still, and I paused and listened The chant rose and fell with the gentle breeze that was stirring, and by its uncommon sweetness drew me on in the direction of the sound I had walked but a few paces, when, leaving the narrow street in which I had been moving, I found myself to my surprise in front of the devoted Synagogue. I stood and leaned upon a broken wall, and again listened with more attention; for the voices of Anna and her mother I knew were mingling in the strain. But I had not stood listening long, ere another sound of a very different kind from an opposite quarter fell on my ear — the distant rumbling of many wheels, the trampling of horses, and the confused murmur which betokens the movement of a multitude. My apprehensions VOL. I. 10 at once interpreted the meaning of the sound. It rapidly approached, and in a moment more a body of artisans, with their implements of labor, and massy engines for the levelling of walls, accompanied by a crowd of the populace and a small guard of Roman soldiers, came into view, and moved on toward the spot where I stood. At the same instant, as it were, the inhabitants of the street up which the army of destroyers were marching, the neighboring streets, and the square — inhabited almost wholly by Jews — became aware that the long threatened and overhanging evil was now at hand and about to fall, and poured forth to witness or to resist the desolation. As if by the power of magic a multitude now stood in the spaces, where but a moment before were but a few idlers like myself. The worshippers within the Synagogue, warned by messengers from without of the sacrilege about to be committed, we now saw descending the lofty steps in slow procession, bearing in their hands the books of the law. They fled not at the prospect of the approaching danger, but gathered around the walls of their ancient temple, as if by their presence alone, with their revered priests and elders at their head, they could avert the storm that had gathered over them, or touch with compassion the hearts of the rude servants of irrestible power, now about to commence the work of destruction. That troop of slaves with their implements — axes, saws, bars, and battering rams, — at the same time drew near, and spread themselves, as if without delay to begin the work, attempting to thrust back with violence the crowds which accumulated around them. But to this first and necessary work were their men unequal, for they had to contend not with the vile rabble that might have been found in the neighborhood of a theatre or a market, but with women, and children, and aged men, the mothers, wives, and sisters of many of the chief citizens of Cæsarea, together with the priests and ministers of their worship. And they were met, too, not by return of blows of violence of any sort, but with tears and intreaties, and importunate cries of deep distress, imploring them to withhold their hands, nor bury in ruins the venerable temple of their faith. The loud sound of wailing and lamentation, arising thus from the voices of the women, mingled in strange and mournful confusion with the rolling of the heavy wheels, the cries of those who managed the engines, the oaths and vociferations of the workmen, the shrill braying of the trumpets, and the hoarse commands of the Roman Centurion, as he essayed to preserve what order he could, hemmed in and oppressed by so great a crowd of human beings. Pilate had ordered that no assault whatever should be made upon the Jews, unless first assailed by them; and that indulgence should be shown to natural expressions of sorrow and indignation; but that open resistance should be punished without mercy. It happened soon, therefore, that the Centurion, not being permitted to resort to any measures of violence, found himself separated from the soldiers, and the soldiers from one another, by the irresistible pressure of the crowds. This was indeed of little consequence at first, because there were no signs of any other resistance being made, than that which proceeded from the weeping of the women, and the passionate exclamations of the men. But as soon as the workmen had succeeded in planting their engines, and raising their ladders, and were preparing to ply their various instruments of destruction, a scene of horror ensued, which, if that Centurion could have controlled his soldiers, might in some sort — supposing any humanity to have dwelt in his bosom — by his interposition have been prevented. For when, after having in the manner I have said planted their engines in the proper position, and they were then for the first time about to ply them upon the walls, the Jews immediately around could no longer restrain themselves, but threw themselves, the women not less than the men, upon them and clung madly to the wheels, to the beams, and even to the head itself of the rams, and also rushing in placed themselves between the instruments and the walls, so that neither could the soldiers work their engines, nor, if they could, was it possible to do so without crushing vast numbers of the people that were upon them, around them, or lying prostrate before them. Such reverence and love was there among them for the place and the Object of their worship. But when neither by entreaty, nor by such force as they could use, was it possible to tear these miserable beings from their fatal grasp, and when every warning had been given them that there would no longer be any delay, then by the force of the artisans were the engines drawn back, and when they had been so held a few moments, were let drive against the walls, and all those who had chosen so to devote themselves miserably perished. Shrieks of agony, cries of horror, and imprecations of divine vengeance at that filled the air. Yet it now availed not. The engines were quickly drawn back again, and again driven against the walls, destroying all who still were in their way. But 10 * when by the Jews, who still possessed their reason, it was thus seen that no signs of devotion and no proofs of constancy could prevent the fated devastation, they then, as it were with one accord, determined that their wives and children should no longer be permitted to be either witnesses or sharers in what was further to ensue; and they were borne away not without force, so full were they of the spirit which is ready to sacrifice itself in the service of its God, to the dwellings which bordered upon the space in which the synagogue stood. Long before this I had with anxiety searched in the crowds for Anna and her mother, but in vain. But while I with others was engaged in this service of placing the women beyond the reach of danger, it was with the greatest joy that I discovered them already secure upon the roof of one of the loftiest dwellings. Now while this duty had been performing, the Romans, taking advantage of the temporary dispersion of the crowd, plied vigorously on every side their huge battering rams, and clouds of dust, and the crash of falling stones gave evidence how rapidly the work was going on. The walls of the outer court and the porches were fast tumbling in ruins. But no sooner were the women disposed of, than the Jews, actuated by one spirit of revenge, forgetting in the heat of the hour the sacredness of the day and their resolutions of forbearance, and rushing in upon the workmen, by the overwhelming force of numbers, drove them from their posts. At this, the Roman Horse, and at the same time also the Greeks, and all others who were hostile to the Jews, poured in to the defence of the workmen; and thus all around, both within and without the walls of the Court, and throughout all the surrounding streets, were the whole multitude mingled in bloody fight. As soon, however, as the Centurion had ordered to the attack the soldiers under him, then forth from out the courts of the neighboring houses, from the windows and doors, poured fully armed, Philip, Simon, and their adherents; and though on foot fell with fury on the Roman and his troop. The Jews were now concentrated on one side of the square, the Romans and the Greeks on the other, and with or without weapons, all were engaged. But the Jews, notwithstanding their desperate bravery, and the freedom with which they sold their lives, were no match for the cavalry of the Romans, and were soon seen to yield their ground, and were, indeed, falling back fast, when they were arrested, and made to turn again with momentary success upon their enemy, by the sudden appearance of a small troop of mounted Jews, with one at their head, whose commanding air, and impetuous charge, inspired his countrymen with new courage. “Come on,” cried he, “men of Israel. For the Lord and Judea” — and, followed by his little band, fell with fury upon the Romans. It was at a moment when it was needful that fortune should show some favor to our people, though to me it was clear that they could not but soon be routed, and that with great slaughter — for Philip, upon whom dependence was placed, more than upon any other, was just then nearly borne down by the advancing Horse. But refusing steadfastly to retreat before those whom he hated, but feared not, and to whom, if so it must be, he was ready to sell his life, he sought, and engaged, hand to hand, with the Centurion. Though so unequal in their advantages, Philip made up in some manner, for his position, being on foot, by his stature, and the superior strength of his arm. The fight hung long doubtful; but, alas! as it could not but be, the Centurion prevailed, and by a well aimed blow, clove his antagonist to the ground. At this moment the Jew horseman came up, and I looked that he should on the instant revenge the death of Philip; but suddenly drawing in his horse, he cried out, in the Hebrew tongue, “Hah, Gentile, Gentile, beware the fate of Abimelech.” Had he to whom this was said understood what those words conveyed, he might, by stooping upon his horse, have evaded the messenger of death; but he knew them not; and they were scarcely uttered, when a stone from a roof struck him lifeless to the pavement. I raised my eye to the spot whence it came — it was Anna's form I there saw, bending over to behold the work she had done; but at the same instant, even as I gazed upon her with both wonder and sorrow, a javelin from the hand of a Roman pierced her through, and she fell back upon the tiles. There was then, my mother, no longer any Cæsarea for me; and I flung myself from the place where, till then, I had remained, (that I might, in the event of the house being assailed, be at hand for the defence of Anna and her mother,) and mingled as full of the spirit of revenge as any, in the thickest of the fight. — But why should I now say more? that soon happened, which I had been looking for. The news of the affray had been carried to Pilate — a legion was on the moment despatched to the Synagogue, and with its overwhelming force soon decided the contest. But I heeded not its presence, I knew it not. Blind with passion and grief, I fought madly, till, as I suppose, I fell senseless, through loss of strength and blood. — I awoke in a Roman dungeon. I am in the hands of Pilate. What the event will be I cannot foresee. If I perish, though thou wilt lose an unworthy son, yet is he one who, in whatever else he failed, failed never in his love of thee. I can now say no more. These lines I am permitted to place in the hands of Zeno, the Greek, trusting that he will despatch them speedily to Rome. Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V. Before this reaches you, my mother, you will have heard of my safety; which earlier knowledge you will owe to the friendship of the Greek, who, as he has said, — not as I believe, — simply because he had no other employment, has not ceased to devote himself to my interests. It is solely too by reason of the friendship, which so strangely and suddenly he conceived for me, that I now find myself on the way to Beth-Harem, having liberty for bonds, the vault of the heavens above me for that of Pilate's dungeon, life for death. I can never know, indeed, that Pilate would not in some other manner, — though Zeno had not interposed, — have obtained a knowledge of the circumstances to which I am beholden for my liberty. Zeno himself declares that it would certainly have been so; for that the governor, seeing how many lives had been already sacrificed, and that he might be called to account for that day's confusion, would have gladly seized upon any pretext to set free his prisoners, which yet it was by no means easy to do and preserve his own dignity and authority. However this may be, I can feel none the less my debt to the Greek, who has shown in these affairs, that however he may affect to have been moved in what he has done, by that restless temper that must be busy somewhere and about somewhat, he nevertheless possesses a heart which is not only no stranger to kind affections, but overflows with a wide and generous humanity. My reflections, when, upon awaking out of the insensibility caused by the blows I had received, I found myself in a Roman prison, all went to convince me that I should there end my days. I had been taken in arms against the reigning power; and, though I had not been long in Cæsarea, could probably easily be proved both to be a Jew, and to have been intimate with Philip and Simon, the leaders in the affray. Add to this the circumstance, that my judge was Pilate, and you too will acknowledge, my mother, that my days must have seemed to me to be numbered. That certainly was my conviction. Yet was it not attended by any self-crimination for the part I had taken, as I doubt not you will suppose it was, or for the cause in which, as it seemed, I had offered myself up. My heart approved what I had done. I had stood up for the injured, the oppressed, and the weak. I had shown myself to be, what I had at length found myself to be, a Jew; — one who was ready not only to entertain an inward persuasion, but to carry it into outward act. Hours were days and months to me in that dark solitude, for the quickness with which truths revealed themselves to me, and struck their roots into my soul, and grew up into strength and maturity. I seemed in my forlorn and hapless state, to be myself an emblem of my country, bound hand and foot, awaiting the sentence of death at the word of a tyrannic and irresistible power. My mind reviewed with pain my long alienation from the faith and worship of my fathers. My misfortune seemed to me a just judgment upon such mad apostasy, and I thenceforward devoted myself, should my life be spared, to the welfare of my country, by such acts as should appear to me to be most for her advantage and glory. Thy early instructions, my mother, written upon the soft heart of my youth, had then sunk deep; and now, in my silence and darkness, they revealed themselves and filled the place where I was with light. The history of our people, and of the care of Jehovah for them, of the good men and prophets who had taught and died for VOL. I. 11 them, all passed before me; and although I felt myself still to be ignorant and unbelieving in much more than I knew and believed, I discovered that I knew and believed greatly more than but a little while before I could have supposed, and enough to make me a Jew in very deed. The prayers, also, which at thy side, or else seated on thy knee, I had in my infancy been taught to say, though for many a year they had not passed my lips, now unbidden returned, and again ascended a sacrifice, for thy sake I will believe, not rejected. I put not my trust, my mother, in the righteousness of the thoughts and resolves, which perchance the solitary fears of my dungeon, and the human dread of a sudden, and it might be cruel death by the scourge or the cross, and not any love of what is good and right, may have prompted. That were a vain reliance. I dare not say as yet, that Rome and her seductions might not, were they soon to try me, easily uproot the virtue, that like a gourd has grown up in a night. May my newborn strength be spared such assault. Thus was I, by the strange fortunes that had befallen me, again recreated a Jew. Yet was this, as I well knew, only so much a new hindrance in the way of pardon or escape. Could I with truth have declared myself a Roman, there was not a doubt, that Pilate would, on the instant, have overlooked the natural ardor that had leagued me for the moment with the enemies of the state, seeing how I was bound to them by both the ties of friendship and of blood. As little doubt was there it seemed to me, that when he should discover, as upon examination he would, the manner in which I then stood affected both toward Rome and Judea, there would be small hope of any other event than immediate death. Day after day did I lie in my dungeon, chained to a pillar of stone, awaiting with patience, and almost more than patience through the new spirit that had taken possession of me, what should befall. No sounds disturbed the current of my thoughts, — which I have now declared to you what course they took, — save the regular approach of the jailor with the portion of food which was allowed me, and the cries, as of those who suffered torture, or who lamented aloud their wretched bondage. The jailor was one who appeared native to the horrors of the place, and to be little different from the stone on which I lay, save that he possessed the power of going from place to place. I quickly learned to refrain from seeking news from one, who either replied neither by word nor sign, or cursed me for my tribe and what he believed my crimes. Once only did he of his own accord open his lips, and that was to declare, as he did with the laugh of a demon, “that that day, at the third hour, a score of Jew dogs, — their heads downwards, — would die on as many crosses at the city gates.” His care of me, he thought, would soon be at an end. I could not but ask if he knew who they were who were to suffer. His answer was in two words, as he drew the bolt of my door, “Jew dogs.” The manner of this man made me feel that there was a lower and more pitiable state than my own. I was happy to be myself rather than such an one. Nay, it seemed to me I would sooner be the spider or the toad that crawled over and around me. But all this was to have an end. The door of my prison was opened not many days after, not by my jailor, but by Zeno the Greek, crying out with rapid and noisy vociferation, that through the intervention of Procla I had at length obtained my freedom, but on the condition, that I should at once take my departure from Cæsarea. I was as much amazed at the sight and sound of this man as if I had never known him; for in the crowd of thoughts I had been so intently revolving concerning the past and the future, the image of the Greek had not once presented itself. Philip, Anna, and their mother had often been present to my thoughts, but not Zeno. Instantly, however, I remembered my former conclusions concerning him, and was at the same time conscious, that as he was the only being in Cæsarea, beside the Jews, to whom I was known, and who had it in his power to do me any service, so it must be to him I was indebted for this unlooked for prospect of life and freedom. I therefore greeted and embraced him as a friend and benefactor. He steadfastly reiterated what at first he had declared, that it was to the powerful intercession of Procla I was beholden for my present happiness, who, having heard an account of the way in which I became a party to the plans and movements of the Jews, and how I had joined at last in the tumult only through a momentary impulse to revenge the death of my friends, pitied me, and besought Pilate for my release, — a mercy, which without much difficulty she obtained. But when I significantly asked from whom Procla could have derived her knowledge of me, a stranger in Cæsarea, — all of my nation who had known me being dead, or at least dead to Procla, — he could not, he said, but admit that among others with whom he had conversed of me and the events which had taken place, was the wife of Pilate, who had confessed, after some things he 11* had let drop, that she thought, rightly considered, I was innocent of any crime against either the power of the Procurator or the peace of the city, and ought to be set at liberty; and so she would say to Pilate. I did not fail to make him feel, — notwithstanding the difficulty of ever obtaining an entrance between either his words or sentences, so as to declare an opinion, — I did not fail to make him at length understand, that I felt how it was to his humanity and undeserved friendship, I owed my deliverance. He impatiently listened to what I had to say, more than once breaking in with somewhat to the jailor, who was at the same time busy in knocking off my chains. Both these offices were, however, at length completed, and we sallied forth from the prison into the light of day and the busy crowds of men. I now had time to ask Zeno after the events which had followed the tumult of that Sabbath day. It was but little he had to say in reply. The Jews were completely routed and dispersed. When they found that to contend longer was useless, they gave way in all directions, and made for the security of their homes. Almost all in this manner escaped from the Roman soldiery; some, however, were seized and cast into prison, — a part of whom had already perished by cruel and lingering deaths. Upon inquiring after the mother of Anna and Philip and what had befallen her, Zeno replied, that no sooner was the work of destruction at the Synagogue completed, than the Greeks in a crowd, joined by many of the Roman soldiery, made for her dwelling and soon razed it to the ground, destroying also the walls of the garden, and whatever else there was on which they could lay their rude and violent hands. The widow herself, knowing in season of the intended assault, was concealed in the dwelling of a friend, and soon as the city became calm again, disguising herself, fled for the dominions of Herod. I now yielded to the hospitable importunity of Zeno, and accompanied him to his house. This truly it was necessary for me to do, whether it liked me or not, for with the dwelling of the wine merchant had been destroyed all that which it contained; so that I could do no otherwise than take shelter beneath some friendly roof, till I should be able to repair my losses. And this too must be done with speed; for, although Zeno had used all his eloquence to that end, he could obtain for me only till the following morning to make such preparations as should be needful, in order to my departure and journey. Through the ready aid afforded by the Greek these preparations were soon completed, and before the sun had left his bed on the day succeeding that of my deliverance, I bade farewell to Cæsarea, and through its southern gate took my way into the surrounding country. A single camel was sufficient for such things as I desired to take with me, committed to the charge of his driver, a Jew of Cæsarea, well commended to me by Zeno for his knowledge of the road and his honesty. Zeno would not allow me to depart alone, but must needs, notwithstanding all the dissuasion I dared to use, accompany me a part of the way. Soon as the city gates were opened therefore we issued forth, plunging at once into the hilly region which stretches to the south of Cæsarea. I had left the particular direction we should take to Zeno, being wholly ignorant, as you may suppose, my mother, of the country I was about to traverse, except that I had a general notion of the quarter where lay the Jordan, the Salt Sea, and Jerusalem. It was with no little satisfaction that, after a scene of so much violence as had lately passed in Cæsarea, and events that had ended so disastrously to persons for whom, though known but for so short a period, I had conceived a sincere friendship, I found myself once more surrounded by nature alone, which is ever at peace. All sights and sounds at this early hour of the day, and this calm season of the year, were such as gave rise to healing thoughts. I had had enough and more than enough, for once, of what I have ever loved so well, strife and uproar; and I greeted with a real and hearty welcome the new world into which I was now entering. The air was still, the earliest rays of the sun were just lighting up the highest peaks of Mount Carmel, a few clouds lay sleeping in the East, a peasant now and then, with his loaded mule or camel, passed us on his way to the markets of the Roman capital, while others were just emerging from their dwellings to commence the labor of the day, — these and the like objects were now before and around me, and I confess I felt it to be no unwelcome change after the days spent in Cæsarea. I rode on at first silently enjoying my new existence, without a thought of my companion, or of the way we were going; and as a thing truly worthy of admiration, Zeno interrupted not my reveries, nor once uttered a word, till at length weary of myself and my thoughts, I asked him, if the camel driver were taking us on the most direct rout to Beth-Harem, for it seemed to me that we were keeping too much to the sea. “It is by no means,” replied my companion, entering eagerly the door I had opened, “the most direct way, but it is a safer way than any other; and agrees by reason of its solitariness with the wish, which but yesterday you declared, to avoid, as much as might be, the more thickly peopled districts, seeing that you felt but little in the mood of mingling or conversing with any, — a poor temper truly for a traveller; for what shall he know more of a new people or country, than before he saw them, who keeps the company only of his own thoughts? He may, indeed, publish the fact, that here he crossed a river, and there a mountain, and there passed through a city or a town, but of what the people are, who are of more account than hills or rocks, he will know no more than his mule. A country is but a larger city, and how, my young Hebrew, should I know the name and the affairs of every man in Cæsarea, as praised be the gods I do, if I went about like thee, with a shut mouth and a frost-bitten visage. If thou wouldst know what is in man, the tongue is better than instruments of torture to find it out. Used with discretion, and as need shall be with cunning, and no corner of the heart shall keep its secrets. There be few in Cæsarea, Greek, Jew, or Roman, but by the use of this gift of nature I am familiar as well with their hearts as their faces. Pilate, the dark Pilate, hath not escaped me.” “How,” I asked, interrupting the stream of words, “have you approached the inaccessible Pilate?” “Pilate,” he replied, “hath Procla, and Procla hath Cataphilus, and through these two Syracusan glasses, properly adjusted, do I read his soul. No man, not Pilate even, is wholly himself; others possess a part, more or less; he must let out into one ear or another, else, as a wine-skin, would he burst with the inward ferment. So that by a careful spying, you without difficulty learn the way through one into another, and thus by direction or indirection do you obtain universal knowledge. The sight of a man, truly considered, is more in his tongue than his eyes; the sight, I say, that sees more than trees, clouds, or hills. But for thee, if thou wouldst travel secretly and unobserved, and without using thy true eyes, this way which we take is the better; and, as I said, it is also safer, and for that reason chiefly is it that I have chosen it out of many. There may be those in Cæsarea who would gladly do thee an ill turn; for be it now known to thee, that in the affray at the Synagogue, at that moment when Philip and Anna fell, and thou didst then plunge into the thickest of the fight, many of the Romans, and some of consideration too, Greeks also as well as Romans, bit the dust; and by many has thy life been with oaths devoted. This way is therefore best for thee; it lies among these hills of Megiddo, a part of the Carmel ridge as thou seest, and is least likely of any to have been chosen as the path to Beth-Harem. Here then thou canst linger and muse at thy leisure, and dream or sleep. Yet before I leave thee should I say, that by and by turning toward the east and leaving the hill country, thou wilt suddenly find thyself at the gates of Samaria; but being a Jew, thou mayest not choose to pass among Samaritans.” Forgetting my new character I informed Zeno with some little energy, that I was a Roman, and cared not whom I travelled among; — Jew and Samaritan were alike. At this he laughed heartily, amusing himself at great length, with the ease with which I was first a Roman, then a Jew, as the occasion or circumstances seemed to require. Thus we travelled on, Zeno having found me a listener again, and overwhelming me with a flood of words — till the sun was well up, and the chill air of the morning was giving way before the heats of an unclouded Syrian day, when he declared that, with whatever reluctance, he must part from me and return to the cooler retreats of the city. I commended to him the mother of Philip and Anna, should she ever seek again the precincts of Cæsarea, and besought him, if such a step would give her pleasure, to afford her every aid she might require to enable her to reach Rome, and take up her dwelling with my mother. This he promised to do; and should such an event take place, I am sure, my mother, it will be grateful to thee as well as to myself. The Greek then turning his horse's head, and giving me his best wishes and the blessing of his gods, was soon lost sight of on his way to the city. I must confess a sadness at his departure, notwithstanding he so often proved a vexation through the mass and the strangely assorted varieties of matter, which without pause he would pour into any ear that remained open. But what was a sensible relief under such inflictions was the circumstance, that he rarely required sign of assent or dissent on the part of the listener; it was enough if there were tokens of so much life as proved him to be awake. Being now left to myself, I took more note of the country through which my road lay, and of the nearer and more distant objects by which I was surrounded. It was a region very full of beauty of every sort; and I was not sorry, though I truly lamented the loss of the Greek as one who had befriended me, to be alone in the midst of it. Hills of considerable height, VOL. I. 12 like the lower ridges of the Appenines, which here and there shoot out on either side to the Adriatic and the Tuscan seas, were on my right and left, some bare and rocky, but for the most part clothed with verdure, and showing, perched upon elevations far above the path I travelled, the dwellings of the inhabitants surrounded by their vineyards, for which they win a place where to a stranger's eye there seems little else than cliffs of rock. But wherever the ground opened, and the hills drew back a space, the cottages of the peasantry were thickly set together, buried beneath the foliage of the rich, fruit-bearing trees of these climes, or encompassed by fields covered with the best products of the season, or by plantations of the olive and the fig. The tall and majestic date tree was here and there to be seen overtopping all others, and giving a sure sign of a neighboring habitation. But chiefly was the eye pleased with the vineyards, in which, as with us, the vines are led from tree to tree and shrub to shrub, where these natural supports are at hand, so forming a thousand shady retreats from the noon-day sun. The vintage was already in progress, and descending the craggy steeps, or winding along the road, or standing at the wine presses were mules and asses heavy-laden, and almost hidden from the sight, by the overhanging burden of the red grapes of Judea. Merry and noisy with the wild songs of the country were many of the troops of laborers, as we met them coming and going with their fragrant loads. “Peace be with you,” was the good wish often bestowed upon me with free gifts of the ripe fruit they were bearing along. All that met my sight or hearing was proof of a happy and contented people, for whom the earth yielded with bounty what was needful to their support, and between whom and a prosperity such as few lands could boast no hindrance seemed to stand but this slavery to Rome; this dependence not indeed so much on Rome as on her servants, who, oftener than is known to the powers at home, thrive by the oppression and injury of the subject province. More and more, my mother, the more I know and see of our tribe, do I find myself drawn to them. Not forever should a people like this dwell thus in subjection to a foreign power. Yet have they now continued for so many years subject in this manner to Rome, and so accustomed are they to the insults and injuries of a state of slavery, that they perceive not the evil of their condition; just as the limbs long bound by chains come at length to be so hardened, that iron is as any other substance. Many have forgotten that they are slaves. So long have they borne the exactions of the tax-gatherer, that they see in him the messenger of a lawful power. Especially is this so among these hilly and remote regions, where they witness no other tokens of their dependent state besides the stated visitations of the publican; dwelling otherwise in security and peace, enjoying the religion transmitted to them by their fathers, and the various customs which distinguish them from every other people. When we had journeyed on several hours, and the heat had grown to be burdensome both to ourselves and our beasts, we looked around for a cool and pleasant spot, where we might shelter ourselves from the fierce rays of the sun, and obtain the rest and refreshment which were now greatly needed. This, after passing over a barren and sandy track, we soon found; for upon leaving it and entering again beneath the dark shadows of some trees, which from their kinds denoted habitations at hand, we perceived not far before us, beneath a spreading mulberry, one of the humbler dwellings of which we had passed so many. No ray of the sun seemed to penetrate the high roof of the mulberry and some lofty palms that were stretched over it. The signs not of poverty, though the house was small and low, were before us, but of comfort that springs from simple habits of life, and natural wants which the fruitful earth abundantly supplied. At the door, turning the mill to the sound of their voices and that of a spring which tumbled from a rock at the side of the house and fell sparkling into a rude basin below, sat two young girls so separated from all other things by their labor, the noise of the stones, their music and laughter and the tumbling rivulet, that our approach was not observed till we were quite near them, when suddenly ceasing from their work, while one shrunk backward within the door of the cottage the other at once arose, and advancing toward me, besought me in reply to my inquiries for refreshment to alight and rest myself during the heats of the day, while herself and her sister would draw water for our beasts. I was not slow to accept her hospitable offers; and in a few moments more I was reposing in the cool shade at the door of the cottage, while our animals were turned loose to feed upon the wild shrubs, and quench their thirst at the spring, from which the sisters supplied the water in their large pitchers. As they performed this service, while no others made their appearance from the dwelling, nor did any others seem to be in its neighborhood, I asked if they dwelt alone. “Not alone,” said the elder of the sisters, as she poured a fresh pitcher of water into the 12 * watering trough, “yet almost alone, for mother we have none, and our father is gone up to the Feast where he strangely abides. Our brothers are in the field on the other side of yonder hill, where they gather the grapes. We shall not see them till the sun has fallen. So it is, Sir, every day; we are at home, but the rest are for the most part away at their labor.” I asked at what feast their father was absent, and where. “Truly,” replied the girl with a look of simple surprise, “I thought you had been one of us.” “Perhaps I am,” I rejoined, “yet still I know not where your father can be gone.” “If,” she replied with hesitation and confusion, “you were a Jew, as assuredly I should judge you were from your countenance, you could not be ignorant, that the great Feast hath just passed, the Feast of the Harvest, at which it behoves every good Israelite to go up to Jerusalem, whither my father is gone, but whence ere this he should have returned.” “The hills,” cried out Ziba the camel driver, “between this and the city, be full of robbers. It calls for good courage and good arms to go through in safety.” “Our father hath both,” replied the daughter, “and we do not fear.” “But what,” rejoined the camel driver, “hath thy father, a Samaritan, to do at Jerusalem? I doubted to rest here — but” — “Fear not,” said the girl, “we are not of Samaria but Judea; but were it not so, the water of the spring could not harm thee or thy cattle.” “That may be,” replied Ziba, “or may not be; when a people are left of God, it is reason that neither their water nor their grain is wholesome.” The girl at this laughed heartily as she said, “Our grain is grown indeed partly on the soil of Samaria; beware of the cakes I shall now bake, lest they choke thee, or change thee to a Samaritan or a Devil. But rest you now while we make ready some food.” “Saying this, the sisters retreated within the cottage, bearing with them the meal they had been grinding, and while I slumbered through weariness and the heat, — it was about the fifth hour, — they prepared hot cakes of wheat and barley, milk, cheese, and honey, of which, when restored by sleep, we partook with many thanks for the great refreshment. When this was over, and Ziba was employing himself in making ready the animals for our further journey, many questions were asked concerning the late troubles in Cæsarea, a rumor of which, both going beyond and falling short of the truth, had reached this lodge in a wilderness. “We hear,” said the sisters, “that great numbers of our people were slain. But as we judge from what we know, the Jews were over hasty, and put themselves needlessly in the way of danger. Alas! we have ever been a people fond of quarrel.” “But,” said I, “do you suffer no burdens which are hard to bear, bound on you by this Roman power? And may not the slave turn on the tyrant who treads him under foot? What say your father and brothers, when the publican comes with his Roman warrant for the fruit of your labors, which goes not to the treasury at Jerusalem, but to Pilate's coffers, or across the great sea to Rome?” They replied, “Ah, Sir, but then we live in peace in our homes, and enough is left whereon to subsist. Prophets have dwelt in poverty, and why should such as we care to be rich? And, besides, if we paid not our taxes to the Romans we should pay not less to some governor of our own at Jerusalem. Our father says, that our own people, when they have held the power, have been as hard as Rome. Our brothers think not so indeed; they are ever crying out for freedom, and think that to be delivered from Rome and Pilate would be freedom; while our father tells them it would rather be anything else.” “Thy father,” cried Ziba, “if no Samaritan is worse than a Samaritan, being, as he is a dog of Herod, the slave of a slave, on whom may all curses light.” “Thy tongue,” cried the girl, “inflamed with sudden passion, is false as Gehazi's; and take heed lest his leprosy cleave to thee. My father is no slave of Herod, and no traitor in act or thought. Were all Jews such as he, then might we rule ourselves. But it is, as he says, because of the rotten heart of the people, that it is needful we be in bondage to Rome or some other power. It is for our sins that it is so, and must be so. Besides, Sir,” turning to me, “we have ever found a friend in Procla, the wife of Pilate, to whom we yearly carry up our country wine and the choicest of our fruits.” “Ah hah,” cried Ziba, “now doth thine own mouth condemn thee.” “I beseech thee,” said the girl, addressing me, “rebuke thy slave; his tonge offends. We are none the less Jews because of the favors of Procla. There are none than we more zealous in every custom of our fathers. But we may be Jews and still believe that a Roman hath a heart as well as we. If it seem strange, that we, though so distant, do know the wife of Pilate, it chanced with her, as with thee, to rest here with her attendants, as for her greater pleasure she took this more secret way, — and to those who love the face of the earth, this more pleasant way, — to Jerusalem; Pilate himself passing through Samaria. When we saw her, we learned that the Gentiles were not all such as at the synagogues we were told, but that the God of the Jews is also the God of the Gentiles, and has set his image in them. For, Sir, surely never was there in woman a gentler soul than Procla's, — nay not our mother's, — and that is much to say, too much it would seem, I doubt not, to those who knew her only. Spite of thy slave, we hope and shall say so, that no evil befel the wife of Pilate in the fight at Cæsarea — for the whole city we have heard was in arms, and many slain on either side.” I assured her that no evil had befallen her, and imparted a greater pleasure still, when I said that I myself, though I knew her not, had been beholden to her for my liberty. As I said this the younger sister exclaimed, “See another traveller approaches, he is in good time. The cakes are yet hot upon the hearth.” At the same moment emerging from a pathway among the surrounding shades, in a direction as if he had come from the sea, appeared the traveller; apparently oppressed as we had been by the heats of the mountain passes or leafless plains. After the wish of peace had been exchanged, the stranger was at once besought by the elder sister to come with his horse to the spring, and himself to alight and partake of the simple fare which still covered the board, — an offer not to be refused; indeed, which was gladly accepted. My attention was at once fixed upon the new comer, for his whole appearance was remarkable. The signs of wealth were many and great, in the horse he rode and his trappings, and in his own dress; but these, though they caught the eye first, were at once forgotten in the greater power of his countenance and form, which instantly made the beholder conceive of him as one raised above others by birth and condition, or his own natural force. He was in the midway of life or beyond. His eye, of a deep and penetrating glance, seemed not only to see what it fell upon, but to pass into it and through it, not as if with any injurious intent, but because simply it had that power. His color was as dark as that of the Jews ever is in this hot climate, — darker than we often see in Rome, except in those who have just crossed the sea, — his beard of a just length and black. These things I at once noted as he saluted me with the others, and conversed with the sisters. I would willingly have remained, but as when he arrived I, with Ziba, was just on the point of departure, I could not well do so, and therefore inquiring first the distance and the direction to the tomb of Ahab on the outskirts of Samaria, I was about to set forth, when the stranger said that as he was pursuing the same road to the same place, he would accompany and direct me, if that would give me pleasure. I was not slow to accept the proffered service, and when resting but for a few moments he had partaken of some fruit and wine, we bade farewell to our entertainers and betook ourselves to the road. When I first turned to where the young Jewess had pointed, and beheld my companion as he issued from the dark wood, it had seemed to me, as often happens, as if the same event had once taken place before, or, as if a dream had suddenly come to pass. As he approached and I beheld him nearer, I did not doubt that I had in some place and at some time before seen him. In a single moment more the truth was plain, that I looked once again upon the Jew horseman of Cæsarea, who, more like an apparition, — even like the terrible horseman that of old in the temple fell upon the royal thief, Heliodorus, — than a reality, had risen from the earth, and for a time turned the tide of battle. It was with great joy that I found myself persuaded of this truth, for it could not be but that such an one must be of power among the Jews, and fitted to give me all the knowledge and counsel I could need or desire. At first it did not appear reasonable he should have on his part any knowledge of me, but when I considered that from what Zeno had let fall, as well as from the manner in which my weapon and my body had been hacked, I had been long and fiercely engaged in the fight, — though in some sort beside myself, — it seemed to me not unlikely, that he also might have some recollection of me, which was made certain almost by the manner in which his eye now and then fell upon me, as we rode on, and was again quickly withdrawn. I, therefore, soon as an occasion would allow, turned our discourse upon Cæsarea, asking him whether he had now just left that city. He replied, that, “as I had seen, he came not immediately from that direction. He had last come from Antipatris; but since he was in Cæsarea, he had journeyed to the north as far as Sepphoris; but Herod having suddenly left that place, whom he had hoped to find present, he had not remained, but withdrawn at once to the sea coast.” VOL. I. 13 “You have not been idle,” I rejoined, “since the affair in Cæsarea, when this same horse bore you against the centurion and his troop at the moment the brave Philip was cut down.” “I too am right, then,” replied the stranger, “in supposing thee to be the young madman who broke loose at the same moment, but driving headlong and blindly into a mass of the Greeks was quickly overpowered and pinioned. I marvel to see you among the living, having once been within reach of Pilate.” I then gave him an account of the manner in which I had been so fortunate as to escape from his power; and in my turn asked him by what chance he had happened to come up at the unexpected conjuncture he did, and by what means, when the odds were so great against him, he had been able to effect his retreat. “As soon,” he replied, “as I heard of the intended outrage upon our people in Cæsarea, I resolved to be there to stand by them as I might. I could not, however, reach the place till the morning of the Sabbath when the assault took place; when, having no means of learning what was to be done on the part of the Jews, — the fight, indeed, was already begun, — I could only rush upon the scene in the manner I did, and with such followers as, with but brief notice, I could persuade to join me. I fought till the coming of a fresh legion of the Roman power made longer resistance to be certain destruction or captivity, without any attending advantage, when with the rest of our unhappy countrymen I fled; and while they took shelter in the bye ways of the city and their dwellings, I, borne by my good Arab, passed the gates, and soon gained the neighboring hills.” “But why,” I asked, “as you made toward the centurion gave you that warning — to save a life you yourself were about to take?” “For the reason,” he replied, “that even as I would not that child of mine should do the deed of Judith or Deborah, so did it grieve me that Anna a child of Sameas should, whom I had known and loved as a daughter. Neither was I willing that a brave Roman should die the death of a dog. Yet how knew I but it was the Lord's doing? And who was I to hinder or defend? Wherefore gave I forth that uncertain voice, which if the Lord so pleased the man should comprehend, and so be saved for a more worthy death with me hand to hand, a fate I should have soon dealt out to him. It pleased the Lord that he should die as a fool dies, by the hand of a woman.” “And it was to revenge her death,” I said, “that I threw myself into the fight, which otherwise I should have shunned; for I deemed it needlessly provoked.” As I said these last words, the eye of my companion fell upon me with a meaning quite different from its former expression, and which showed that dark passions were lodged within. “How sayest thou?” he bitterly asked — “needlessly provoked? Is the life of a Jew nought, and his faith nought? Shall he at the word of a Roman give up both? Is he forever to be the sport of the tyrant? Are his only words to be, here is my neck for thy foot, and my throat for thy knife? Verily I thought thou wast a Jew also. Why then didst thou fight to revenge the death of a Jewess? What was she to thee?” “She was much to me,” I said, “as was her mother — even as for two weeks and more I had dwelt beneath their roof, and in that short time had I come to love her as a sister. And it was to revenge her death, and not because I could justify the revolt of the Jews, that I joined the fight. Yet do I not, in saying this, admit that I am no Jew. I am now a Jew, if I was not in Rome whence I am but lately come, and it was because I had become a Jew, that I withstood Philip and his adherents to the last, as more mad than wise. They were as men driven by their passions, and seeking their own revenge rather than their country's good.” At this the Jew horseman looked at me as if he hardly understood me, notwithstanding his far-reaching and all-embracing eyes. A calm again came over him, and in the tones of his former conversation he said “I perceive, young man, there is virtue in thee. Abjure thy Rome a little longer, and dwell among thine own people, and thou wilt grow to be worthy of thy great descent. But the Roman Jew, as I take thee to be, is no Jew.” I said that it was my purpose to see the whole of the land, in its length and breadth, from Dan to Beersheba, and from Arabia to the shores of the Sea, ere I again returned to Rome; and but for the interruption of my plans occasioned by the tumults of Cæsarea, I should long since have been at Beth-Harem, whither I was now bound, and whence, after abiding there a space, I should set forth on my Jewish travels. “Whom seek you at Beth-Harem?” asked the stranger; “for I myself dwell there, and will guide you on the way.” I said I sought the dwelling of Onias a prince, as I was told, of that country. “None so well as I,” he quickly replied, “can 13* take you to his dwelling, for I am Onias of Beth-Harem.” At this unlooked for announcement, I was amazed as you may well suppose, my mother, and could only say in return, “that I then was his nephew, Julian of Rome, the son of Naomi.” Not less astonished, than I, was thy brother in his turn. He welcomed me heartily to the land of our Fathers, and would not doubt that, when I had dwelt for a time beneath his roof, I should take too deep root in the soil ever to flourish again in that of Italy. He asked with great affection after your welfare, and wished that you too had undertaken your travels to the East. For a long time we conversed of the condition and welfare of our family, dispersed as it is so widely in Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Syria. He ended with saying, that he trusted ere long that events of such a kind would take place in Judea, as to call back all wanderers and residents in foreign lands to their native soil; new scenes were about to unfold. Since leaving the cottage among the hills, where we had been so hospitably entertained, we had journeyed on through a richer and more highly cultivated soil. Although the region was still hilly, and rocks were to be seen jutting out on the sides of the hills, yet was there no spot to be discerned from their base to their summits, which did not bear testimony to the labors of the husbandman, and was not burdened with the products of the latter harvest. Villages on all sides, wherever the eye could reach far around, were seen half buried amongst the dense foliage of these regions, and the highways everywhere filled with the heavy wains, drawn by oxen or bulls, and laden with fruits and grain. Never had I beheld a region that gave better proof of industry and skill on the part of the inhabitants; or where the population appeared to enjoy more of the common comforts of life. We were still winding along among valleys of utmost beauty and fertility, when as the hills on the north began to open, Onias said, that we were now within the territory of Samaria, which, for his own part, he would gladly have avoided; but seeing, as he judged, that I should feel desirous to pass by a place so famous as the city of that name, he had departed from the course which he was accustomed to pursue when he crossed over from the sea to Beth-Harem. “Soon,” said he, “as we reach yonder hillock on the summit of which you can already see the ruins of the tomb of Ahab, will you obtain a view of the city.” In a few moments we stood on the place to which he had pointed. The ruins of what had been a structure of some magnificence covered the spot, over which towered palms and cypresses. Before us and below us lay the city, built upon an elevation of an oval form in the midst of an extensive plain, bounded on all sides by a circle of hills. We ourselves were upon a part of the southern range which thus hemmed it in. At a distance were visible, toward the sea, the tops of Carmel, and toward Galilee Mount Tabor, towards the Jordan Hermon and Gilboa, and behind us Gerizim and Ebal; while in the north, like the light clouds that were above us, we could just discern the snowy peaks of Lebanon. The city glittering beneath the rays of the sun, then not far above the horizon, gave unexpected tokens, in both the extent of the walls and the overtopping structures within, of its extent and the wealth of its inhabitants. I expressed to Onias my delight and surprise. “What you see,” he replied, “is the work of Herod; not, as you may believe, of those half-idolaters. Herod wanting a strong hold here in the heart of the land, rebuilt Samaria, which, since the destruction of it by Hyrcanus, had lain in ruins. Now, by reason of the immense sums which Herod expended in the building of the walls, and in erecting temples and theatres within, and especially because of the multitudes of new inhabitants, Greeks, Jews, and Romans, whom he compelled to remove thither, it is grown to be a place of some consequence, but not of so much as its foolish inhabitants are fain to believe. They are a bastard race. Upon a Gentile stock have been grafted decayed and rotten branches from all parts of the earth, so that there is as little of the blood of the Jew in a Samaritan, as there is of the true faith of a Jew in his doctrine. Come on, let us give them our backs. May their prosperity decrease daily.” I would willingly have lingered longer on a spot so agreeable in itself, and which spread out before the beholder so wide and beautiful a prospect. Inwardly resolving at some future time to return and examine at my leisure a country that seemed to offer so much to reward the observer, I followed Onias, and Samaria was soon hidden again behind hills and woods. “Sebaste,” said Onias abruptly as we resumed our journey, “Sebaste is the name which Samaria now bears, given to it by that flatterer Herod; a Roman name to a Jewish town — as ill sorted as a born Jew with a Roman name. What ill chance gave thee the name of Julian?” My father, I answered, would have it so, who, he might know, was no lover of his own race. “I might have guessed as much,” replied Onias; “Rome weaned him from Judea. And when Rome spoiled him of his Jewish nature, it wrought a greater ruin than sometimes when it spoils a kingdom. Thy father was born for greater things than he ever performed. His days were passed in amassing wealth; they should have been spent at the head of armies.” “So,” said I, “is it ever the nature of the more powerful to draw everything over to itself. The greatness, splendor, and renown of Rome, dazzle the young mind and easily take it captive. It was but a little while since, that to be known to be a Jew, was to me the great affliction of life. In truth the shame of my descent has been to me the only evil I have suffered from my birth. Wealth could satisfy every wish of my heart, but it could not cause me to be born again; it could not change the hue of my skin, nor the features of the face.” “Happy for thee, Julian, that a power higher than thyself ruled over thee and saved thee. Judea needs thee; and I trust to see thee answer to her call.” I said, that I was now bent upon knowing the exact state of the country, that I might learn what part it became me to act. I could not in Cæsarea take sides with Philip, because as I judged, he was over hasty, and outwent the judgment of the people at large, whereby he injured rather than benefited a good cause. “Nevertheless,” rejoined my Uncle, “it was a sign of the times, and showed what is in the heart of the Jews. What happened in Cæsarea would have happened also in Jericho, in Sychar, in Bethsaida, nay even in Samaria; for so much may be said for Samaritans, that they love not Rome, but look, even as we do, for a deliverance from her dominion, and for a Deliverer. Julian, the time ripens! The wise and the good of our land, with impatience await what shall ere long be made manifest.” Onias said this in deep and significant tones. I hoped that he would go on, but he paused. I then said, “that even in Rome I had heard somewhat of that concerning which he spoke; but it was little and uncertain, and I knew not what to think. From my mother I had heard of a day of deliverance to which our tribe looked forward, and of the coming of Messiah; but of what was truth and what was error, in such expectations, I knew nothing. Philip too had spoken of the same things. But, to me, it all seemed doubtful and baseless, without anything certain and fixed, to which the mind could attach itself; — while that Judea was an oppressed and degraded kingdom, that her rights were withheld, her sceptre unrighteously wrested from her grasp, her liberties gone, were things that every eye could see; and the remedy for such evils not difficult to be devised, nor out of all hope to be carried into execution.” Onias, at this, looked upon me with an expression not easy to interpret. But words soon followed. “Young man,” said he, “your speech is both pious and impious. The piety, I believe, is your own; the impiety is your father's. Had God forsaken you, as your father did, you had now been altogether as one of the Gentiles. But He has watched over and redeemed you for ends greater than you now know of. When once beneath the roofs of Beth-Harem, I shall trust to weed out the errors that now offend thy mind, and plant in their place the seeds of truth. There be others there also, men learned in our laws, at whose feet a willing disciple shall drink in wisdom as water.” Onias, as he said these words, fell back into himself, as I perceive he is ever prone to do, and we continued our way in silence. The shadows of evening were now around us, and we were travelling still among the hills that stretch to the east and south of Samaria, but not in solitudes, for the country was everywhere thickly peopled, and the ways were yet filled with travellers to and from Samaria, and with the peasants of the neighboring places, returning home with empty or loaded wagons. I was looking to keep on our journey during the early part of the night, and reach the Jordan at least, before we slept; but my uncle now informed me that a little distance beyond where we were, we should arrive at the Inn of Jael nigh unto Thebez, where we should rest, for our beasts' sake, until the following day. While he was speaking we emerged from the hills and woods, and descended the last slope which conducted us to the plains. As we thus descended, Mount Hermon was before us, over which the moon was just climbing; and beneath us lay the valley of the Jordan stretching to the horizon, covered with its villages, the nearer of which were clearly visible, with groves of the palm intermingled sending their lofty tops to the heavens. I was too much engrossed by the beauty of the scene to think of my companion; and we rode on, each pursuing his own thoughts, till we approached the Inn of Jael. This we found thronged already by those who had come to seek shelter for the night; for, at this season of the year, although a fierce heat is apt to rage through the day, the air becomes cold at night, VOL. I. 14 and heavy dews descend, so that the covering of a roof or of a tent is necessary. We at first believed there could be no room for us, the concourse of strangers was so great, the courtyards being crowded with their beasts and their lading, and the apartments and the roofs with their owners and attending slaves. But no sooner did Jael discover who was his guest than the room, which had been refused us by some to whom we had first applied, was quickly furnished. We were conducted to the roof where, a tent being spread over us, we partook of our evening meal and prepared to rest for the night. When we had supped, and I then sat looking off upon the surrounding country and conversing, Jael, our host, joined us with low obeisances and formal speech. He hoped that the great Onias had returned in peace. All the country had lamented his absence. It was many days, and seemed months, since he had bestowed upon his poor dwelling the honor of his presence. “I learn,” said he, “that thou hast been beyond Sepphoris even to Sidon.” “Farther than that, Jael,” replied Onias, “even as far as Antioch and Edessa. What hast thou heard from Beth-Harem of late; are all well?” “All are well,” replied Jael; “to day a traveller from the East, and who had passed through the midst of Beth-Harem, reported, as from those who had knowledge, that all were well in the house of Onias. — Thou wast not, then, at the outbreak at Cæsarea, where the mad-cap Philip, son of Sameas, threw all the city into a blaze.” My uncle frowned as he said, “Jael, thy soul is too much in thy purse. The Lord reward thee not according to thy zeal for him; for thy lot were then truly but as that of the wicked.” “Should I,” said Jael quickly, “plough up a wheat field thick with full and milky ears only to try a better seed? Should I shave this beard, in hope that a comelier one might sprout? Should I take out a bill against my wife, that I might win perchance a better? My beard is well enough, my wife is well enough, my wheat is well enough. Ah what shall come of change and commotion but losses? Who suffer now? None but rogues and mischief makers. Who” — “I will not reason with thee,” said my uncle with impatience. “It is well for Judea that some souls are made of other stuff.” “In my belief,” continued Jael, “the Jews of Cæsarea were dealt with after their deserts. A man now-a-days can live scarce a day in peace for these sons of Belial. But the blood let in Cæsarea may keep it cool in Jerusalem, so shall good come of it. Hast thou heard the news here on the Jordan, Onias? If we now bestir ourselves we may do greater things than they in Cæsarea.” “What mean you?” said my uncle. “I speak,” said Jael, “of John of Hebron, who hath taken pains to travel beyond the Jordan, and up and down in that region, some say, stirring up the people, but others only preaching. But who can stir the people more than he who preaches? The ears of the council or of Herod I trust will be open to take note of him.” “But what mean you?” said Onias, “and of whom do you speak? Jest not after thy fashion.” “I speak truly but what I hear,” replied Jael, “and jest not. I have not seen this wanderer myself; but have heard somewhat from every one who hath come from beyond Jordan. Some even hold him a prophet; but it were nearer a truth, I doubt not, to hold him possessed of a devil. Prophets do not grow on every bush.” “How is he followed?” asked my uncle. “From far and near,' answered Jael, “have people resorted to him, some even from Jerusalem. But that makes for nothing, seeing that they of Jerusalem are ever running after some new thing.” “What,” continued Onias, “is the manner of his life and appearance?” Jael could not say. He had heard a thousand varying accounts from travellers, but knew not which were true nor which were false. His belief was that he was one in part beside himself, and who was therefore just the kind of adventurer to amaze and seduce the people. With the help of a few magic arts, he would soon make himself great. The vociferations of new comers, now calling loudly upon Jael, put an end to our discourse; our host descended with reluctance to perform some of the duties of his office, and soon after, closing the folds of our tent, we fell asleep.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">14 * VI. Fatigued by reason of our journey of the preceding day, the sun was far advanced into the heavens before the noise of the inn-yard woke us from our slumbers, and we were ready for the pleasing labor yet before us. Crowds of travellers, in not more haste than ourselves, surrounded the gate-ways with their camels, asses, and other beasts of burden; some quarrelling with Jael on account both of their entertainment, and the sum he had demanded of them; some with each other about some idle distinction of nation or tribe; while a large number pursued in quiet their own affairs, or looked on and laughed at those, who, because life did not present enough of necessary evils, were seeking to multiply them. Jael moved among them a sort of monarch, from the power he possessed, not over others, but over himself, therefore indeed, over others also. He was not to be ruffled by any of the reproaches, which, whether justly or not, were showered upon him. Those who had abused him most he did not fail to dismiss from his dominions with some wish of peace, while from them he received, perhaps, only curses in return. “Jael,” said Onias, as we stood beneath the shadow of a plane-tree, watching the scene, while Ziba was making the last preparations; “Jael is a man who lives for himself alone. Though you behold him so pliant, and so prompt to please and serve, and so patient under what seem undeserved reproaches, he is yet as void of faith, both toward man and God, as this pomegranate-shell is of meat. His aim is but one, his purse. And to fill this in the best manner he justly thinks, is to attract by his attentiveness and submissiveness to all, people of all names and nations, — Jew, Samaritain, Arab, or Roman, it is the same to Jael, and Jael is the same to them. He is just to one, as soon as to another; and will defraud one as soon as another. In what proportion he is knave, and in what honest, no one knows. When I am on this road, and weary with the way, my feeling is, and doubtless it is so with all, “here now shall I be certain of such observances as hardly my best friend could lavish upon me;” and I approach the roof of Jael as if it were another Beth-Harem. Behold there! how to that churlish Greek he returns smiles and parting salutations for railing.” He then approached us as if for some further discourse, but we at the same moment mounting our beasts and bidding him farewell, he only wished us well on our way, and we sallied forth from the yard. “The sun shines not more constantly,” said Onias, as we plunged into some deep, thick shadows, beneath which the road here wound along, “than the face of Jael; but while the sun shines for others, Jael shines only for himself. His smiles were frowns, unless each drew fish of some sort to his net, birds of some sort to his snare. He perceives no difference between Roman, Greek, Jew, and Samaritan, but as they contribute more or less to his wealth, which grows and swells like Jordan in the early rains. Though the land now lie cursed and barren, and the enemies of the people of God rise up around her, and dwell within her very borders, carrying her not away into captivity, but binding her a captive on her own soil, not a finger would this man move for her deliverance. Nay, rather, I doubt not, would he league himself with the adversary, than that the base traffic should suffer damage, which fills his hands with gold. And many such there be here, and over the face of the whole land, so that were Messiah himself to come, I surely think they would deny him, except he came in Cæsar's name. Saw you not last night his manifest vexation at the reports brought from the Jordan?” “It was evident enough,” I replied, “that he liked them not. They foreboded in his ear a new uproar as in Cæsarea. But in these rural districts there could be little danger.” “I know not that,” answered Onias; “the people lie thickly sown among these deep shades; we see them not, but they are for multitude like the ripe seed of the mustard shaken by the winds from the tree. A great cause would call them up in hosts not easily numbered. And a slight cause rouses them. For if many be of Jael's nature, more are not. The ears of the people are wide open to any sound of liberty. The rulers, as is ever with those who enjoy power, are indeed of another mind. Change could do little for them in the best event, and might shake them from their seats. But the people do yearn, even as the hungry for food, for the approach of some power that shall raise them to their ancient place. They await its coming with impatience.” “They will then,” I said, “flock around this prophet on the Jordan; if he be one in truth. Yet we perceive no signs of it.” “There are not a few,” rejoined my uncle, “who, moved by what they deem a divine impulse, go forth to teach and declare in the streets and highways, in wild and desert places, what they might as well deliver within the walls of the synagogue. These now cease to stir the people. He, of whom Jael spoke, seems to be of this order. There will be other signs, — another approach, when He shall come. Time will unfold what it shall.” Onias here withdrew into himself, buried in thought, of which he seemed to desire no participator. So we then rode along in silence together on our way; but soon wearying of this, I left my uncle to his reflections, and turned back to where Ziba was slowly toiling along with his heavy-laden camel, that I might hold discourse with him. As I reached him he was singing at the top of his voice a song in praise of the wines of Judea; but soon as I joined him he broke off, saying, “that by the song he was singing he was trying to lose the taste of the vile drink that had been served to him by the rogue Jael, which was more sour than the visage of Ben-Ezra of Cæsarea. Truly, those maids in the woods knew how to deal with a stranger, camel-driver though he was. They were no Samaritans after all, that was certain. Their wine was sweet as a dried grape, and it was poured out like water. Jael's, indeed, was in abundance enough, but what signifies an abundance of that which cannot be swallowed. Yet would he stand by and commend it as fit for kings, and sweeter than wines of Greece or Italy, with such oaths and smiles, too, that one was ready to give the lie to his own burning throat. Well, well, wait a while, and the poorest of us will have better wine than the best of Jael's.” “How so? shall you all turn vine-dressers? or what is to happen?” “What is to happen? A Jew! and you know not that? You may hear it every day with your ears open. Things are not to remain as they are. Some new kingdom is to be set up, some say under Herod of Galilee. So the Herodians, most of them, think. As others judge, he who is to reign is yet, and shortly too, to make his appearance, but how or whence, no one knows, or can know. But why do I tell you this, when you are yourself, I doubt not, a scribe at least. Yet, methinks, I heard you are from Rome.” “I am from Rome,” I answered, “but still I am a Jew.” “What sort of Jews,” he asked, “are they in Rome? I do not know that I should think thee a Jew. Do they keep the law in Rome?” “Surely, or we were not Jews.” “I see not that,” answered Ziba. “We keep not the law here in Judea, yet we are Jews.” “There are two ways,” said I, “of keeping the law; one is, to keep the letter of the law only, as the Pharisees; the other, to observe the letter, but keep it in its spirit too.” “We only do the first here-abouts,” replied the camel-driver. “There 's that Jael; he is an elder of the synagogue hard by his inn. You would think, to see him there, as I have when on this road, that never a prophet loved God like him; yet the next day shall you pay him a full sum for sour wine, and your camel's food shall be half chaff, while he will at the same time so smile and affirm as to cheat you, before he has done, out of your own judgment. As I have heard the Prophets read and the Law, they command not only to say prayers, offer sacrifices, and go up to Jerusalem at the feasts, but to be an honest man besides. Is it not so?” “Surely, I should think it so.” “I warrant you it is, if it is anything. I truly, do not keep the law any way; I am a camel-driver. But this, that I have said, is the sort of keeping I see in Cæsarea and Jerusalem. Ah! what do I not know of some of those long-faced Pharisees? Many is the time in Cæsarea I have tracked them from the very doors of the synagogues to their haunts. For me, I love an honest sinner like myself. None of your two-faced, smooth-tongued, rotten-hearted knaves, who, having cheated the world all the week, think on the Sabbath to cheat God as well, by their fastings and prayers. It is these, who choose the highest places in the synagogues, where we can all look on and see the game that is played, that teach us to despise not them only, but the law too. Such have more to answer for than their own wickedness in the judgment-day, who have not only not kept the law themselves, but hindered those who would. There 's many a ruler of a synagogue I have known, who, if he were in the world to come to keep company with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob for his reward, it would not be good company enough for Ziba, the camel-driver.” “In the new kingdom you speak of under Herod, or some other, you will look, I suppose, to see all these things mended, shall you not?” “I know not as to that,” replied he; “as I said, I shall then look to have plenty of wine, — sweet wine, too, not such as Jael's — and other such things, for the reason which is plain enough, that the Romans will be driven off, and all that now is stolen from us and carried VOL. I. 15 away beyond sea will remain here, and the poor will have their share of it. And, perhaps, vastly more than this, for the priests tell of great things. But I believe less than half of what a priest says. Some of them say the kingdom will last a thousand years, and some forever. Many good things might come to pass in that long time, or even if less than half as long.” “But do you not suppose, that under Messiah men will be honest, — honest and good?” “I know not how that is to be,” said Ziba; “I hear not much about it, that is all I can say. They talk of great riches, great armies and victories, and of having Rome under our feet; and Romans for slaves, — dogs as they are; — but they say little about keeping the law any better then than now. And, by my head, I think if there was much to be done about that, we should hear less of the new kingdom, than we do. But come, let us prick on; there are travellers yonder about to meet us, from whom we may learn news; let us come up with thy companion, who lies in wait for them under the shade.” So saying, he urged his beast into a round pace, and we soon came up with those who were advancing from the region of the Jordan, but who, before we reached them, were pausing with Onias beneath the shadows of some spreading trees. They were a company of merchants from Philadelphia, beyond Jordan, bound to Cæsarea. After the tedious ceremonies of salutation were over, which in these parts occupy as much space, as in Rome the business itself would for which they are the preparation, — Onias first asked them of the prosperity of their city, and then of the country round about them, and if there were of late anything new concerning Arabia, which questions, when they had been diligently answered, and they had asked as many in their turn, and received the desired replies from Onias, my uncle then inquired of them concerning the rumor which had met him at the inn of Jael at Thebez, of a prophet, who had made his appearance in the neighborhood of the Jordan, and whether they had either seen him, or heard of him. He, who seemed to be the principal person of the company replied, that they had crossed the Jordan at the ford just above Enon, and had slept in that village, where indeed they had heard of the person of whom Onias spoke, but he was not now in those parts. “What,” asked Onias, eagerly, “think the people of him? and has he been at Enon?” “He has not been at Enon,” answered the other, “but passed by on this side the river. The people, however, seemed to think, from what was reported of him on all sides, that he was surely a prophet. They could speak of nothing else at the inn where we lodged, but we were too weary with the heat and travel of the day to give much heed to what was said, — besides that affairs of our own were to be transacted. If, as would seem, you are bound to the same ford at which we have crossed, you will learn there more than we can tell. It were better, I doubt not, for this wanderer, whosoever he may be, to stay at home and attend to affairs that concern himself alone. He who would mend the state does the most in that way, and most surely, when he keeps himself and his own affairs whole. The Lord will prosper the diligent. And when all are diligent, each in his own business, then riches are multiplied, and the whole land is a garden.” “The wisdom of what you say,” replied Onias, “is past all doubt. But then when men are not diligent, when the wicked rule in the land, when it is because men are the subjects of Sin that they will not mind their affairs and their households, what then shall be done? Before they will become diligent, they must be brought away from their wickedness; they must be made to know that it is their sin that stands between them and their own prosperity and the prosperity of their country, and that except they repent the vengeance of God, it may well be feared, shall be poured out upon them, as of old on these cities of the plain. But who shall do this great work? Where is the rabbi or the priest among us, who hath either wisdom or power to reach ears that are dull as adders', and hearts hard as the nether mill-stone? Verily, we may despair for Israel, except the Lord have compassion and send unto us whom he will.” “When the Lord sends or speaks,” rejoined the other, “the signs of his presence will be such as the eye cannot be blind to, but will see and confess as it does the sun over our heads. I learn not of any such signs, in this case; but rather that he of whom we speak is some houseless traveller, sordid and poor in his attire, and likely to be in the keeping of some devil, rather than his own wits. But you will hear and know what you wish as you travel further on. In the mean while the Lord keep you. Come, neighbors.” Saying this, and giving a blow to his ass, he started on his way, followed by his companions and their loaded camels; not concealing by their loud talk and laughter, as they drew off, that they held my uncle's earnestness in light esteem. After the civil encounter of the 15* first meeting, which we had observed as we rode up, I had looked for a quite different interview; but Ziba's opinion was perhaps a just one, that they had hoped to drive some trade with us, and seeing no hope of that as the conversation was prolonged, but that we were quite another sort of travellers, they scrupled not to vent their vexation in the way they did. As they disappeared, Onias broke forth; “A besotted and ignorant people! what hope is there of Judea? The one part are slaves to Rome, another part are slaves to riches, and another part are slaves to sin. Yet is the Lord as capable to turn the heart of this people, corrupt and stiff-necked as they are, as I the head of the beast I ride. One thing is not easy and another hard to him; one is not more easy than another; nor one more hard than another. He can take up all Rome in the palm of his hand, and blow it into air, even as fine dust, and this great plain of the earth itself can he crumble into atoms by a word of his mouth, and it shall vanish forever. What to him, then, is Judea, and the hearts of all her people? Can he not turn them whithersoever he will, and is there any to hinder? The end of time is come, even upon us; the days are fulfilled; and that, which all who yet have hearts desire, shall come. This broad land which to-day lies cursed and barren, delivered over to the hands of strangers, may even to-morrow, if the Lord so will, (and ere long the word shall go forth,) sit beneath the shadow of her own king, and blossom as a garden of roses. Shall Pilate longer reign where David did? Shall this Roman Nebuchadnezzar from the other side of the Great Sea forever hold us in this worse than Babylonian bondage?” These things, and more than these, did Onias pour forth, rather as if uttering what was passing through his mind, because it would come to the lips, than as addressing me. Ziba was in great astonishment, and doubted whether he, who was so caught away from earth, were not himself possessed of a spirit of prophecy. He said, “that although he was but as one of the wicked, yet when he heard one speak, who seemed filled with a good spirit, he felt moved toward him, and could be easily turned about by him as he would. The priests and elders,” he continued, “move me not, seeing they read and speak as though their own hearts gave not out what they said, but their lips only. So that if it appear that they themselves who know the law best, and are the priests of God, are not persuaded of what they declare, that it is true and excellent, how can they persuade me? I have ever seen that when I take a traveller through steep and rocky passages, full of windings and pitfalls, and reported to be beset by robbers, they ever have the faith which they behold in me. But I cannot believe the priest, because he believes not himself.” I could not deny that he had reason on his side in some good measure, and that until the synagogue was reformed, he would find little motive to change his way of life; yet, I added, that surely all the synagogues were not alike, — nor all the rulers and priests; he ought not to make one stand for all; doubtless, there were those, who were as pure as the law they taught; I had known such in Cæsarea, and even in Rome. Ziba, however, never had. He believed there were none such, and that their hypocrisies had succeeded in blinding me. So have I found this poor man, even as I have found many in Rome, having much good in his heart, and many desires of what is better, yet in truth believing in nothing, and trusting none by reason of the deceits and vices, which he had seen to be practised by those who have been the ministers of religion. Good men will ever make good men. And even in the precincts, my mother, of the idol temples of Rome, have I seen virtues to grow up and flourish, and all good habits and customs prevail among the worshippers, not, as I believe, because there was any force in the faith they had or thought they had in their gods, nor because they themselves thought there was, but only because they beheld sincerity, goodness, and simplicity in the lives of the priests, who urged such virtues upon them. If a priesthood is pure, the faith of the people will be stable; the reality, which their own hearts tell them religion is, will not be contradicted by what they see in the characters of those who profess to know and believe more than themselves. But so soon as the worshipper suspects the sincerity or the virtue of the man, who makes it his business to teach virtue and the law of faith, then it seems to him the foundations on which he had been standing are taken away from under his feet, and all is darkness and doubt. What has it been, — why should I forbear to utter the truth, — but thy virtues, my mother, which have preserved some faint light of faith in my soul. Long before I could declare the reasons why it was so, I felt that the worship of our synagogue was day by day uprooting the early religion which by thy care had been planted in my heart. I used to tell you of my thoughts, and how it was because of what I knew or believed to be true of our Priest, that I felt my youthful reverence for holy things to decline and die within me, and how it was because of what I saw and heard of the divine virtues of the venerable Saturnus, that I was almost persuaded to become a worshipper in the temple of Jupiter. They who gathered round that excellent old man, and listened to his maxims, but more than all, were daily witnesses of the manner of his life, felt that there was nothing so worthy and real as what they saw in him, and they strove to become like him. This was true faith. I heard and admired with them as often as I could elude thy watchful eye, and it was only thy image ever rising before me that saved me from throwing myself into the arms of an abhorred idolatry. For, I said, if it is not what Saturnus believes of his Jupiter, that draws me toward his temple, and I scarce know what he believes — I am persuaded, moreover, that whatever it is, it is a miserable superstition — but simply the divine beauty of his spirit and life, why for that should I esteem his religion more than my own? Shall the virtues of Saturnus, the Pagan, weigh with me more than those of Naomi the Jewess? Are they either more in number, or more god-like? If the virtues of the Pagan bind the youth who hear him to his faith, shall not the virtues of Naomi bind her son to his? So that often as for reasons, which thou knowest well, I was tempted to renounce the religion of my father, and all belief of every kind and name, it was still my unwavering faith in the reality of virtue as seen embodied in my mother, that held me back and taught me patience and humility. I waited; and distrusting my power at so young an age to determine questions so weighty and difficult, resolved to believe in virtue if in nothing else, because I saw in thee that it was a something as stable and real as the earth itself, and beautiful as the light. Our road since we left the inn of Jael, had run through a country with a surface gently flowing like the summer waves of the sea, rising and falling, but never with abruptness, save that on our left at this point of our journey there rose a steep and lofty hill. Soon leaving that behind, the prospect before and around us was wholly that of an extensive plain, crowded with villages, covered with an abundant vegetation, and giving tokens in the richness of the soil, and universal verdure, of our approach to the Jordan. As occasionally we emerged from the deep and grateful shades, which were cast over our road by the heavy-leafed trees of these warmer regions, and gained a slight elevation, we could see the waters of the river here and there gleaming through the foliage. Next, Enon rose before us, standing not far from its banks on the hither side, and Onias having affairs to despatch in that place, we made towards it, although, as you will perceive by the marks which I have set down of our journey, it lies far out of a direct course from the hills of Samaria to Beth-Harem. It was necessary that Onias should tarry there a space, and besides, as he assured me, although coming by the ford of Enon would extend the line of our travel, yet should we be abundantly repaid by the greater pleasantness of the road, especially by that part of it, which, between Enon and Beth-Harem, lies on the bank of the river, and on its eastern side. After parting from the three merchants of Philadelphia, the day being then far advanced, we had met abundance of travellers, both such as belonged to those regions, and such as had come from different parts of Peræa and Arabia. Of many had we made the same inquiries as of the merchants, and from all obtained what established the truth of the rumor which had first met us at Thebez — that a stranger from the south country had appeared on the Jordan and in the districts on either side, about whom the people were greatly stirred, but concerning whom they did not seem to have learned anything from which much could be gleaned as to his real character and purpose. The expectations of the whole nation being toward the appearance of him, whom they believe to have been promised, they readily behold in any remarkable qualities of an individual some of the features, which they expect to distinguish that great personage, and thus easily deceive themselves. What we desire to see, we are apt to think we see. So that although in this John from Hebron, there be in truth none of the signs which should announce the Messiah, all are wondering within themselves, and to one another, whether it may not be he. At Enon, while Onias was prosecuting his business with those whom he wished to see, we still continued to ask the same questions of all, as on the road, but without arriving at any knowledge that was much more distinct; and what we heard from one often was at variance from what we heard from another; and this notwithstanding John had already been on the Jordan near the place, accompanied by some who had joined him as followers; so difficult is it where the expectations are of a certain character, to make up our judgments according to the real appearances before us, rather than in agreement with what exists only in our own minds. When Onias had ended what he desired to accomplish in Enon, we set forth towards the Jordan which now lay but a few furlongs from VOL. I. 16 the town. I approached with curiosity and delight this stream of which the name and history had been so long familiar. I well remembered how, as the feet of the Priests who bore the ark touched its brim, the waters dried up, and after they had passed over, the multitudes of Israel followed in safety, notwithstanding it was the time of harvest and the Jordan overflowed all his banks — a miracle which for its greatness is like those wrought in Egypt, and which together show so evidently that God manifested himself in those days to such, and for such things, as he deemed worthy. At this time of the year we found the river deprived of more than half its waters by reason of the drought; and so, although it seemed broad, broader in truth than I had looked to find it, yet did it also appear much more shallow, seeing that I had overlooked the fact that, like all rivers which take their rise among mountains, it is subject to great inequalities, being swollen so as to overflow its banks at the time the snows melt and the early rains descend; and then during the great heats of summer being diminished in like proportion below its ordinary size. The banks were thickly grown over with every kind of shrub and tree, here and there overhanging the waters, then retreating and leaving an open space of clear grassy slope. The gaudy flowers too of this climate were everywhere glittering in the sunlight, or else themselves sending out rays of light by reason of their gorgeous colors, as they grew among the deep shadows of the trees. Birds too — now indeed silent through the heat of the day — but of hues like flame, glanced hither and thither amongst the branches of the willow or the broad terebinth. And up and down on either side of the stream were companies of the inhabitants of the neighboring cities and villages, reposing in the shade, or watching their children as they pursued the shining insects that darted through the air, or venturing into the Jordan sported in its swift running waters. The scene on either side of the stream, as it wound its way along, was very beautiful to the eye and the mind; and as we slowly bent our steps to the water there where the ford was, and entered it, we could not refuse, so inviting was all around and not least the cool waves running below, to linger and pause frequently as we went over, each confessing that if we sought to indulge our humor, it would be to remain just there where we were through the heat of the day. But as such pleasures must have an end we presently reached the further side of the river, and pursued our way on the Eastern bank down toward Beth-Harem. “Now,” exclaimed Onias, as we left the waters of the river and ascended the opposite bank, “are we within the Dominions of Herod, who is in part at least a Hebrew; yet whether a Hebrew but in part or not, it is he who should now be king of Judea. Philip is not he. He is too much the lover of peace for such times as are to unfold. Herod was born for them.” “Yet even Herod,” said I, “is subject to Rome. It matters little who is king of the Jews so long as he holds of the Romans, not of us, or of God.” “As the eye judges, Herod is truly subject to Rome,” replied Onias. “But there are those who serve and yet govern. Is Tiberius, or Sejanus truly Emperor? There are those who appear indeed to be among the low and humble, who yet, by reason of the soul that reigns within, are higher than monarchs. Some though there be a crown of universal dominion on their heads, are yet as nothing — nay as dirt — in comparison of him on whom the glory of the Lord rests. Tiberius is to-day the absolute lord of the universe, but another may be more than that to-morrow, before whom that great Emperor shall humble himself as a slave. Hast thou faith, Julian, in the prophets?” I said that I had been duly instructed in them by the piety of my mother, and that I doubted not they were moved of God. “Of whose kingdom then speaks the prophet, when he says that his kingdom shall be everlasting?” “I suppose I should answer, of the Messiah; but I pretend not to know with exactness the sense of the prophets. I am but a learner as yet in my own religion.” “Nevertheless,” said my uncle, “thou hast answered well. Doubtless it is said of the Messiah. His kingdom shall be from sea to sea. Now, even now, is the time it were come. But if God's Kingdom come now and be universal, that of Rome shall be swallowed up and lost as a drop of water in the sea. May this thy kingdom speedily come, O Lord, and thy servant behold its glory.” My uncle as he uttered this ejaculation fell into his musing frame from which it was a long time ere he showed any disposition to return and resume his discourse with me, which indeed gives me not much light from his refraining, as it were, to say all that is in his thought. He does little more at any time than approach the borders of somewhat that lies in his mind, never fairly laying open the regions about which he excites your curiosity. I presently, however, asked him of Herod, of whom we had just spoken and of whom I knew little, and of a brother of his, who held some small 16 * government under Rome in the Eastern part of Judea. “Herod,” he replied, “about whom you inquire, the oldest living son of the great Herod, and often known under the name of Antipas, is one well able to reign over a larger dominion than that which he possesses, which is indeed but a pitiful rood of earth, if one compares the territory with Rome or with what he is fit to govern. He is of all the sons of Herod the Great of the nearest approach to his father, in respect to the vigor of his mind, and all qualities that go to make a monarch worthy of his name and empire. Especially does he possess that far and deep seeing eye that penetrates the purposes and minds of other men, and knows how to lead them, and cause them to work his will, whether or not they themselves would choose to do so. He amazes by the sagacity and subtlety of his devices. For while you have deemed him to have been engaged in one enterprise, or compassing one object, suddenly it appears that he had a quite different end in view, and those who look on can only admire at a power which they cannot comprehend or measure. A great destiny awaits him. The central sun of Rome may yet grow dim before what is now the feeble glimmering star of Galilee. “More surely and sooner,” continued Onias, “might we look for such issue, could he work according to his will with his brother who governs as tetrarch in Trachonitis — Philip. But in him we find none of the signs of true greatness. He is a Jew indeed; but a Jew with none of the ambition of the Jew. It is enough for him to govern his little kingdom in peace, administering justice among his subjects, enlarging the borders of their prosperity, and paying duly and without any signs of discontent his subsidies to Rome — the proof and the badge of slavery. Though mild and gentle among his people, he is yet obstinate, and intractable to the will of his brother, who hath hitherto failed, with all his skill, to pour into him a portion of his own spirit, and wake to life a soul dead to his own honor and the greatness of his country. Were another Antipas in the seat of Philip, another day would soon arise upon unhappy Israel. Yet though to the eye of man mountains of obstruction intervene, all is easy and the way smooth to the power of the God of Abraham. A reed from the banks of Jordan in his hand shall break in pieces the earth. And by one, as well as by two or a multitude, can he confound the counsels of princes, and bring them and all their greatness to nought. What was the rosy-cheeked David, the little son of Jesse, with his sling and stones, to the giant of the Philistines with his sword like a weaver's beam? Truly in himself he was as a lamb before a lion lean with hunger. But seeing Jehovah was in the arm and sling of the boy, of what avail were the sword and strong armor of Goliath? It matters not neither how nor where Philip bestows himself, nor whether he gives or withholds. Himself, not Judea, will be the loser. So, too, touching him who dwells in Jerusalem, Herod-Philip, the affairs of the world can proceed without him, even though he should refuse to his brother the little power, which, by reason of his descent alone, he holds over the populace of the capital. Nevertheless, what he may refuse, might be won through another.” “You mean,” I said, “his wife.” For I had heard of her through Philip and Anna in Cæsarea. “Yes,” replied Onias. “I speak of her, the daughter of Aristobulus, in whom lives all the greatness of the great Herod. Had the providence of God made her a son instead of a daughter, the world had now been full of her fame. Even as a woman much might be achieved, but what can a lioness do yoked to a mule? She must first break away from the unequal bonds that yet hold her. Thou hast not seen Herodias, Julian?” “I have never been in Jerusalem,” I replied. “But she is often in Cæsarea,” said Onias, “and was there, as I have heard, at the games of Herod; was it not so?” “She was looked for, as was also her daughter, with great expectation,” I replied, “but they came not.” “Doubtless,” answered Onias, “her husband had intelligence of the expected tumult, and so forbore to put himself where his presence might have been taken amiss by Pilate. Yet I marvel why Herodias went not; since it is no less than the very life of her life to oppose her proud and lofty beauty to the milder charms of Procla, and so divide, at least, if not bear away with triumph, the praises of the theatre. Mayhap, however, Antipas was in Jerusalem.” These things I set down, my mother, as answering the questions you have asked concerning this family. As I learn more from thy close and reluctant brother, more will I deliver. We were now far on our way to Beth-Harem, and ere the sun should leave us, we should easily reach it. I was truly desirous to arrive, as with my common impatience I had become weary of my long communion with Onias, relieved only at times by a little jesting with Ziba, and not less with the sameness of verdant beauty, which stretched all along on either bank of the Jordan. Yet was it, I believe, still more than these a desire to behold the residence of Onias, and the fair Judith, that occasioned my dissatisfaction and some complaints, I fear, of the slow progress we made. Much had been told me of the estates of Onias by Philip; but more by Anna of Judith, his daughter, “who,” she would say, “is the bright star of Beth-Harem and of all that region, and in her light you, Julian, will forget this little dark shadow in Cæsarea; but then, what is that to me? I am content it should be so, while I can have the love and friendship of Philip.” Alas! my mother, that a light like that of Anna should have been so early quenched! To her, and her brother, do my thoughts continually turn back, whenever the novelty or beauty of some present object does not take me away from myself. If Philip was rash and over-confident, he was, nevertheless, brave, and a willing sacrifice for the freedom of his country. No thought of his own glory, I believe, ever had a moment's place in his mind; it was rage at the oppression of Judea, and a thirst of revenge that drove him on, and swayed him so as to blind him to the obstructions, which, mountain-high, lay between him and the attainment of his end, nor only that, but made his ruin and death as certain as his attempt. Though I could never approve as wise the measures which he pursued, and think it was only passion and the spirit of revenge that could justify them, — which truly justified all that he did, and would have justified all he could have done, or devised, — yet do I abhor the wanton tyranny, which drove him to his rebellion, and wait with impatience for the day that shall witness a just retaliation. And this the more, as the form of Anna rises before me as at the moment I last beheld her, transfixed by a Roman javelin, — that child of truth and nature, who loved her country and her faith as Roman never did, but who loved her brother more, and concealed it not, but would confess that though her reason sometimes doubted him, or rebelled, her heart was ever stronger than her reason, and made her the very counterpart of himself. Certain I am, that no other will ever again so possess my soul as Anna; yet had she lived, who could have shared any portion of that love, which was no longer hers to give, but was all her brother's? Anna dead is to me, perhaps, as much as Anna living ever could have been. As thoughts and remembrances like these arose in my mind on the way, I hardly wished to see Beth-Harem. I would rather dwell among the dead than the living. I cared neither for Onias, nor Judith. But they quickly gave way again to others, and I was ready to press my uncle to make more speed. At a moment, when I was in this latter mood, thy brother said; “Behold, there are the walls of Beth-Harem! We must now for a space part from the river and turn our faces toward the hills.” The sun was not far from his setting, and was pouring over the land a whole flood of yellow light, as we thus left the river and moved on among the more broken and uneven lands which lay toward the East. When we had continued not long in the midst of such scenes, passing among the rich fields of the husbandmen with their simple dwellings half-hidden by overhanging vines, or buried beneath fruit-trees, we at length entered upon lands, which, by the manner in which they were cultivated, and their great extent, showed that we were approaching the dwellings of some of the richer proprietors of the soil. Soon, upon emerging from a grove, through which our way had wound along, we came upon open, level grounds, covered with veneyards, olive-orchards, fields of grain, and wide-spreading pastures, in the centre of which upon a gentle elevation stood ranges of low but extensive buildings, which I needed not my uncle's exclamations to assure me were the dwelling of Onias. A few lofty palms, and a single terebinth of a great size were the only trees immediately near it, as, except that for a considerable space in every direction there stretched out a smooth and verdant floor of turf, the grounds on all sides were usefully devoted to gardens and vineyards. Over and beyond the fields and buildings of the “prince of these regions,” were visible the walls and towers of Beth-Harem, giving me to see that while it was not a place of the largest size, neither was it insignificant either for its extent, or the structures whose outlines could be distinctly discerned, gilded as they now were with the last warm rays of the declining sun. Quickening our pace, we soon threaded the winding way which led from the public road to the house. As we rapidly approached, Judith, followed by her maids, hastened to meet us. Onias, springing from his horse, tenderly embraced and kissed her, asking a thousand questions of her welfare, and of that of all the household. Then, turning to me, he said, “and here is thy half-gentile cousin of Rome, with his gentile name, Julian, the son of Naomi; he is now thy charge. Let him have no reason to say, that the barns and store-houses of Onias refused to open for him their best treasures.” “For his mother's sake, and his own,” replied the daughter, VOL. I. 17 “he is welcome; his Roman name shall not deprive him of Jewish hospitality.” Onias then leading the way, we entered the house. The refreshment of the bath, in which, and in other forms of washing, the Jews of Palestine indulge yet more than we of Rome, soon restored me to myself after the heat and fatigue of our long journey. The household of Onias I found to be numerous; composed, however, not of his own descendants, — as Judith is his only child, — but of members of our large family from every part of the world, whom he gathers round him, even as a patriarch of old, exercising over them a sort of lower providence. When we had eaten, we ascended to the spacious roof, to pass the evening hours. A broad tent was here spread to defend from the dews which at this time of the year begin to fall, and from the cool breezes which sometimes spring up in the night, even after the day has been oppressive through its heat. Here we either sat and conversed, or else walking about, I learned from the mouth of Judith the names and directions of the principal objects in the scene, being lighted up by a brighter moon than it is ever our fortune to behold in Rome. Onias seemed little disposed to join our discourse; yet, whatever was his preference for a close communion with himself alone, he never refused to lend his ear when Judith spoke. We had been talking of Rome, Cæsarea, Philip and Anna, of Pilate and Herod, to all which Onias had given but little attention, when Judith turned to him, and said; “I hope, father, that now these long expeditions will cease; or if they must still be undertaken, that you will be persuaded to send our new cousin in thy stead, who has not as yet seen that region. But what of so great moment can a vine-dresser, here on the banks of the Jordan, have to do with princes?” “My daughter,” replied Onias, “seek not to know what may not be revealed; at least, not as yet, nor to woman's ears. Let this suffice thee, — that the vine-dresser of Beth-Harem is not leagued with princes for any end which his daughter could not approve, or Jehovah smile upon.” Judith, who had evidently spoken in a sportful manner, seemed grieved by the grave reply of her father, and hastened to say, “that she doubted not her father; yet, could she not but apprehend possible evil, when he was departing so far from his wonted manner of life, and binding himself to associates so different from his former ones, as Herod of Galilee.” Onias rose and walked to and fro upon the roof. Presently he asked if any had been impatient to see him while absent. Judith replied, none, save a messenger from Machærus. Had he brought letters? asked Onias. No; his communication must be with Onias himself. He, then, kissing his daughter, and commending her to her bed, and me to early repose after the toil of our journey, descended to his apartment; we following him, and resorting also to ours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VII. I awoke, my mother, not in Rome, though my dreams had carried me there, and placed me at your side, vainly attempting to win away your attention from the book of the prophets, which according to your wont, in the morning's prime, you were diligently pondering. It was the rebuke of your sometimes severe countenance at an impertinent jest of mine, that broke my slumbers. Slowly the mists of the night drew away and left me in the full consciousness of my position. My eyes fell upon unaccustomed objects; the open casement held up before me a distant prospect of stream and plain, hill and tower, such as I never before had seen; the song of birds, whose strains were new and strange, voices of laborers or of the servants of the household calling to each other in the Syriac tongue, — not even yet an agreeable melody, — met my ear; these, and other sights and sounds by degrees informed me that I had been sleeping neither in Italy nor Rome, but was still a sojourner in the barbarous clime of the further 17 * Palestine, even upon the outskirts of the Asiatic deserts. In that sense of utter feebleness of the will with which we first wake in the morning, it seemed to me, that I would renounce all knowledge of other places and people, for the sake of being once more in Rome. I cared not for Onias, Judith, Judea, nor the whole East, in comparison with Rome and thee. But action, and the bath, and the fresh air of the housetop, soon scattered these worse than dreams, and restored me to my manhood. In a part of the dwelling not far from where I had slept, I found Onias and Judith, with others of their large household, awaiting me at a table well covered with bread, fruits, wines, and dainties unknown to the vocabulary of Roman art. Thy stern and contemplative brother saluted me, methought, with no very encouraging fervor, but very much as if he were addressing a new comer as little welcome as expected. But this I regarded not, for I knew, that so soon as his dreamy thoughts could be gathered together, some from Jerusalem, some from Galilee, and some from Rome, he would comprehend who I was, and I should be dealt with accordingly. From Judith my greeting was quite otherwise. She hastened to meet me as I entered, and by the natural ardor of her manner, and the glow of her most expressive countenance, made me feel that I was in but another home. Indeed, my mother, thy niece is very beautiful. Shall I speak of Rebecca, or Ruth, or Rachel, or Judith of old? Rebecca at the well, with our great father Isaac, as tradition paints her, was not to be placed by the side of Judith, the daughter of Onias, when she rose from her embroidered couch and gave me the salute of peace, and then proffered me the refreshments of the loaded board. I believe I only gazed at her in return, and gave as many signs of distraction as Onias himself; for before I had fully recovered myself, I heard from one who was near, “Can it be that Rome hath no women?” Those few words, not intended to reach my ear, brought me to myself, and gave a new direction to my eyes, and unloosed my tongue. There was then no want either of food for discourse, or of disposition to engage in it, save on the part of thy brother, who during the whole repast spake never a word, unless it were in reply to questions urgently pressed upon him, and those relating to the matters immediately before us. No sooner were our duties discharged towards both ourselves and the substantial dishes that had been set for our refreshment, than, Judith leading the way, we turned from the apartment where we had been sitting, and were conducted by her to an extensive portico, stretching along the side of the house that overlooks the Jordan and the vineyards which lie along his banks. The single terebinth of a giant size, of which I have already made mention, stood near this portico and spread its broad arms so far, that some of them reached and cast a grateful shade over the spot where we sat, defending our eyes agreeably against the rays of a bright summer sun. The dwelling of Onias, I could now observe to be even more extensive than in the twilight of the preceding evening I had supposed; and to be composed of parts varying greatly in their forms, giving signs of having been built at periods remote from each other, and by those who paid no regard to any other rule than to indulge each his own particular fancy in what he added or altered. As I have said the building is low and of but a single story; yet its lowness is in seeming only, owing to the large space which it covers. The rooms within are lofty, and the portico where we sat — of Roman construction and order — is of a height not less than that which adorns the house of Drusus on the Palatine. I was not surprised to find Roman architecture here beyond the Jordan; for since the power of the Herods has been felt in Judea, there is scarce a considerable town but it is adorned with Roman structures; so that to behold their forms as I travelled through the country lifting themselves up on every side, overtopping and outshining the native buildings, it truly seemed to me that I was in Italy rather than elsewhere. Sebaste, Tiberias, Gamala, Cæsarea, and Herodium not far from Machærus toward the Dead Sea, are all Roman or Greek. The older portions of the dwelling of thy brother are neither Greek nor Roman, but in a much earlier manner. They are built of huge stones rudely put together, but in a manner to defy the power of time to disjoint or cast them down; of the same manner and form with those, which are found in all the country stretching to the east of the Perea and Trachonitis, but by whom and in what age erected no history relates. They appear, travellers report, to be rather the work of Titans than of men, and have served for the dwellings of successive generations. Those parts of thy brother's house, which are the work of more modern times, bear small resemblance to each other or to the original and older portions, but spread themselves out in every various direction and form, agreeing only in the same general elevation; to this, however, there is the exception of a single broad tower rising to such a height as to overlook the whole region round about. Another Portico runs along a part of the front which faces towards the south, resembling that in which we were now sitting, but of less extent. A large space as an inner court is enclosed by the sides of the building, where a fountain plays, and over which is often drawn during the hot days of summer an awning of cloth upon a frame prepared for it, as a protection from the heat and as yielding an agreeable shade. It is without difficulty partially broken up, or removed, when either more of light, or air, or warmth is desired, or when it becomes needful either to raise objects from the court below to the roof above, or to lower them down. The proper ascent to the roof is by stairs from within the dwelling; yet it can also be ascended from without. “You are pleased, as I judge by the direction of your eye,” said Judith when we were seated, “with these proofs of a Roman taste. They cause you to feel as if you had wandered but a little way from home, and were not quite among either strangers or barbarians. Of your family we have scarce heard anything more, than that you have adopted the Roman religion with Roman customs.” “You have rightly judged,” I answered, “that I am pleased with these signs of Roman taste in this noble Portico, as well as in many other things. The useful and ornamental arts I would have common to all, and by no means confined to one people or one faith. It is no good reason because Judea holds one form of religion, in which she excels other nations, that she should reject forms of art in which others excel her. Do you not think so?” “I do indeed,” Judith replied. “Nations are more likely to live in harmony the more they can innocently adopt of each other's customs, as well as the more they can see of each other. And so thought our ancestor, Alexander, to whom we owe most of these modern additions, but so thinks not Onias, the son of Alexander.” In saying which Judith raised her eyes from the embroidery on which she was employed and turned them on her father. “Verily I do not;” rejoined Onias. “This worship of everything Roman is the new idolatry, which not less than that of old, into which our rebellious forefathers were ever falling, shows us false to our true descent, unworthy of our name and faith, rebels against God, and if we repent not, destined quickly to perish. We are one half of us pagans, heathen, Romans, Greeks, everything, in Jews' clothing. The last offence is, to be ashamed of what God hath made us, and that the Jew is. Surely God's judgments will overtake and overwhelm us. My father, — may he rest in Abraham's bosom, — was a good man, yet nevertheless a worshipper of idols not less than Ephraim. In this, at least, may I be permitted to boast, that my hatred burns toward all but Judea. Julian, I rejoice to tell thee, my daughter, is better than by your first words you have taken him for; he has in part at least renounced the false faith in which he was nurtured, and returned to that of his Fathers. Born a Jew, but living thereafter and believing as a gentile, he has now, since his foot has touched the soil of Judea, and his eye seen her dishonor and her wrongs, turned back to what he was when his only learning was such as fell upon his ear, as he sat an infant upon the knees of Naomi. If my ear deceived me not, thy cousin last evening gave thee in part a history of his life.” “He spoke,” said Judith, “of Cæsarea, of Anna and Philip, and of his adventures in their behalf; but of his faith I could gather but little. It is in truth a greater joy than I looked for to greet him not only as one of the household of Alexander, but also of that of Abraham and Moses.” I then for the satisfaction of the fair Judith imparted to her much of what I had already, on our journey thither, related to thy brother, concerning the earlier part of my life and the causes that had led on to changes so considerable. She heard with deep attention, her hands often ceasing from their employment and her countenance turned towards me, showing her too much engaged in what was said to bethink herself, whether she were listening to any other than a familiar and long accustomed voice. I wished my story longer for the sake of such a hearer. In the manner in which she yields to nature in the ardent expression of her countenance, being governed by no other power than her own feelings, Judith reminds me of Anna; but while Anna was too much swayed by others, Judith is mistress of herself, and with all her passion shows a firmness which could not be turned from any path she deemed right. So at least I judge now after so brief an acquaintance. When I had ended, Judith said, “I praise God, Julian, that he has brought you back safe amongst your own people, and to his own service. But then, I at least will tell you, what from your narrative you seem not to have learned at Cæsarea, that though Judea is trodden upon and oppressed, as you yourself have witnessed, it is not in her innocence that this has happened. She is not guiltless before God. Think not that she suffers but for her iniquities. It is these that have brought her so low, blotted VOL. I. 18 out her name even from among the nations, and caused that for these many centuries no prophet of God hath come as of old to instruct and hear us. Wickedness is in the land. They who sit in Moses' seat are usurpers. The law is honored by the lips but broken in the life. Cunning men have put their own conceits in the place of the word of God, and pass them off upon the people for his own truth. Through the multitude of such interpretations and the impudence of the priests the law is set aside and of no effect. It is not, Julian, deliverance from Rome alone that can heal our diseases. An Egyptian bondage (and ours is lighter) were not to be deplored like this great corruption of the heart. We need a physician of the soul who shall thoroughly purge it, and make it a dwelling cleansed of every foul thing, a habitation meet for the spirit of God. Freedom from Roman Power could not do this. Alas! I fear it would but swell our pride the more, and remove farther off than ever the day when God shall visit his people. Till he shall see signs of repentance he will never come, never. Jordan would sooner flow back to his springs.” As Judith said these things tears stood in her eyes, which were lifted from her work, and fixed upon the flowing river as it wound along gleaming in the sunshine. Onias, who had been pacing to and fro along the portico, now paused before his daughter and said; “Judith, Judith, thou art ever too exacting toward our unhappy land. Thou judgest her hardly. Her sins are manifold in truth, but still are we not of the seed of Abraham? and who then is like unto us? who shall ever rise into our seat? whom doth Jehovah honor but us, and for whom as for us are the ages waiting to bring forth their treasures? shall not the promises of God be made good? Moreover, what causeth the sin that is and for which the land mourneth, but this thrice cursed power of the gentile over us? While the idolater is in the land and its ruler, will not the people as of old bow down and worship the images that be everywhere set up? First, my daughter, first of all must the oppressor be smitten, and the oppressed made free; then shall the seed have been destroyed that brings forth this harvest of iniquity. Then shall righteousness find space and soil to grow, and the gentile shall not be here to cause blasting and mildew —.” A maid servant here quickly entered and said that a messenger from Machærus was just arrived in haste inquiring for Onias. Thy brother at this started, and with precipitation passed into the house following the servant. When he was gone I still sat conversing with Judith; but perceiving that her mind was now frequently withdrawn as if possessed by other thoughts, I too departed and bent my way toward the deep shades, which not far before us I beheld covering a slight elevation on the hither bank of the river. “Beneath those shades,” said Judith as I went, “you will find a calm and cool retreat, where, when as now the sun blazes with unusual heat, we sometimes pass the noonday hours. A simple structure stands beneath those trees, hidden now from our sight which overlooks the river and the vineyards. I commend you to its pleasant seats.” Saying these things she passed into the house, while I pursued my way to the vineyards on the banks, and the retreat to which Judith had commended me. Passing in my way through gardens, olive grounds, and vineyards, I came at length to the spot at which I aimed, distant at least half a Roman mile from the house. The building, hardly to be seen till approached very near, I found to be of a circular form overrun with vines, which climbing up the columns to the roof then hung down in a confusion of polished leaves, bright berries, flowers, and fruit. A few gray rocks here and there breaking through the ground rendered the ascent on the side toward the river difficult, the more as among them grew wild plants, shrubs, and flowers, according to their will, untouched by the hand of art. From the entrance, open toward the south, the eye fell first upon the slope of meadow and vineyard along the nearer bank; then upon the sacred stream as it wound slowly away and was hidden at length by overhanging foliage, and last upon a remote prospect of hill and wood, mountain and desert, even as far as the borders of the Dead Sea, till the warm haze of those regions shut in the scene and mingled the heavens and the earth together. I was not unwilling to enter where there was held out so rich a promise of rest and seclusion. Couches of many inviting forms standing around tempted to repose, of which, to say the truth, notwithstanding the sleep of a long night, I still had need. Here then I passed the morning and midday hours, now gazing forth upon the new scenes before me, and wondering what my course should be, and now watching the labors of the distant husbandman as he gathered in the last returns of the harvest; sometimes buried in musings which, beginning in somewhat bright as morning, ended as is their wont in sleep; sometimes satisfying at once both hunger and thirst with the grapes which ministering hands had heaped upon the table; and sometimes in writing to thee, my mother, to thee whose image 18 * waking or asleep is ever before me, outshining all else above or below, real or unreal. No step intruded on my privacy, no sound disturbed my slumbers or my musings, save that of the bee as he flew from flower to fruit, or from fruit to flower, or of insects and birds, as half asleep they sent forth now and then a drowsy note, showing that they as well as I were tasting the joys of a perfect repose. Thus I either sat or lay, until the sun sinking behind the hills, and the growing coolness of the air, warned me of the hour of the evening repast; for here as with us the principal meal is at the close of day, when the heat hath subsided and its labor is done. Many days like this, only varied with such changes as you, my mother, will readily imagine, now passed away. Instructed by Judith, I made myself familiar with Beth-Harem and the surrounding regions, visiting with her, or alone, all such objects and places as were worthy to be seen, either for their present interest and beauty, or for their connexion with the early history of our people. In these brief journeyings I saw and discoursed with many of the inhabitants of these parts of Judea, in every condition of life. Among all I discovered a temper of dissatisfaction, and undefined desires and expectations of somewhat soon to be unfolded of advantage and glory to the land. Some great one is to arise, they are sure, who shall fulfil in his person and his deeds, and the power of his dominion, all that seems to them foretold by their prophets. They have been much stirred by the sudden appearance of this John of Hebron on the banks and in the wildernesses of Jordan; but they do not see in him the signs of that power whose approach they are expecting, though they hold him to be one sent of God. We all desire to hear and know more of him. But, as we learn, he is now in upper Galilee. Onias has been absent many days, insomuch that Judith wonders greatly thereat. No more, my mother, at present. Name me with affection to our neighbors and friends, and especially to Hirpinus and Lucretius, who are returned, as I have heard, suddenly to Rome. Thou shalt soon hear again. Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VIII. I keep my promise, my mother, and again present myself with wishes of health and peace. Now when Onias had been absent, as I have said, many days, to the great concern of Judith, — which in these times is not strange, for so much does wickedness abound in all parts of the land, that it is not without danger that any one trusts himself in remote or unfrequented places, — he at length returned in safety indeed, but as it seemed also, in no small perturbation of mind. His manner was more close and dark than even that which is usual with him, and it was a long time before, by our approaches, whether more or less direct, we could arrive at the causes of his discomposure. Judith, by her playfulness at some seasons, and her deep earnestness at others, seldom fails to reach her father's inward ear; and though he at times turns away even from her, yet is it done never with severity, or as if it were possible for any word from her to offend him. Although her questions now seemed to grate with harshness on his spirit, yet he refused not to answer them. “We have missed you greatly, father, these many days. But since you have been in kings' palaces we look to you to make amends for your long absence, by the agreeable things you have to tell us. Saw you the fair daughter of Arabia? They say she is unhappy.” “Who say so?” asked Onias. “Surely,” said Judith, “you have heard it many times. I speak but the common rumor.” “I know not how it is,” replied Onias. “It is a pity if it be so. The great should never marry, — or not till their greatness is reached, and they can take their equal.” “Because one is great then,” exclaimed Judith, “he must no longer be a man! Truly I think as to the women of Judea, they would rather marry a man for the reason that he hath the affections of a man, than because he has the greatness of a king or hero.” “Yet,” answered Onias, “a man may find all in one, which Herod hath not. The daughter of Aretas hath a seemly beauty enough, if one, great like Herod, should have regard to the poor varnish, easily spoiled, of a fair skin — beauty more than enough to satisfy him, — but the wife of Antipas should show other and greater qualities.” “Surely she hath goodness,” said Judith, “so the world reports of her. And is that not much?” “But,” said Onias with force, “she hath not greatness. She is no meet companion of a king.” “Alas for us,” rejoined Judith. “Let me die a maid. As I have ever judged no greatness is greater than a true love. But this I see is woman's folly. — The poor lady must be unhappy I think; and all we have heard of Herodias is now, I doubt not, true. Herod's journeys to Jerusalem are in search of greatness. I marvel how the Arabian king will take these rumors. Methinks, if he be as fathers should be, Herod will have his hands more than full.” Seeing Onias to be disturbed, I asked, to divert the conversation to another subject, if at Machærus, he had learned anything concerning the affairs of Cæsarea. This gave a new turn to his thoughts, but at first, I feared, hardly a more grateful one, for he was manifestly troubled. But he spake with freedom. “Cæsarea,” he replied, “is, as I learn, still at peace. But between Pilate and Herod there is growing up discord, springing from that affair. Angry letters have passed between them. Pilate hath even thrown upon Herod the blame of my presence and taking part in the fight; and though he hath not continued to require my being delivered into his hands, as at first he did, he doth demand that the citadel of Beth-Harem be surrendered to the Roman forces to be occupied by them. To this Herod must yield, — he can do no otherwise, — so that in not many days troops from Cæsarea will cross the Jordan on this errand.” “It appears to me,” I replied,” an unreasonable measure of precaution much beyond any possible danger to Rome, to set a garrison to watch an individual — a vine-dresser here on the banks of the Jordan. Pilate's vigilance in Cæsarea was by no means in proportion to this.” “Doubtless, Julian, it is so. That is very true. It seems so, indeed. What then is true, but that Pilate sees deeper than does the common eye, and discerns dangers brewing of which others are not aware.” “But what other dangers are there, that Rome should stand in fear of?” I asked. “I can see none. The people of these regions seem quiet and at peace.” “So they appear,” replied Onias. “Surely there is nothing that shows otherwise. The Jew is all too well disposed to peace. In that rogue Jael, who keeps the inn at Thebez, you may behold one whom half the Jews of the land are not ashamed to resemble. Nevertheless there are others, if in the comparison few, who are of another mind. There may be danger from these. The cold rocky ground often covers over hidden and fatal fires.” “You utter yourself darkly, father,” said Judith; “your words hint at more than they speak.” “Be content, my daughter, with so much; neither look farther nor deeper than the words themselves which I have spoken. But whether there be danger, or not, I cannot like to see Romans in the citadel of Beth-Harem.” In this manner did Onias communicate with us on his return from the fortress of Machærus. What his apprehensions really are I cannot tell, for he plainly is not disposed at present to make even Judith a partner of his thoughts. It seems not to be believed that Pilate should have any such fears of Onias or myself, as to render so strong a measure necessary as that which he is about to take; and in my judgment he hath seized upon the affair at Cæsarea merely as a pretext, which with the people will possess some show of reason and be abundantly justified at Rome, for taking possession of a strong hold, which in the occurrence of hostilities would be of so great advantage to the stronger party. Herod, is greatly and justly incensed at so high an act of usurpation on the part of Pilate, for Beth-Harem lies within the boundaries of his tetrarchy, and is secured to him by the same acts of the senate which have given him his dominion. But what people are secure against the aggressions of Rome or her governors, when it suits their purposes to encroach upon them? The possessions of any King tributary to her stand but in a breath. A word spoken beyond the seas in the heart of Italy, and thereupon distant empires are dismembered, kings and princes dethroned, treaties violated, territories alienated, honor, justice, and mercy trampled under foot. Herod has no power to contend with Rome. He can but remonstrate — and submit. But the friendship, which hath heretofore subsisted between the Roman Governor and the Jewish Prince is from this moment at an end; and the mutual offences, which will now be given and taken on the one side and the other, it is not difficult to foresee will ere long lead to serious misunderstandings or open feud. A few days have passed away, and what Onias feared and foretold has come to pass; the Roman power has made a secure conquest in Beth-Harem. We have witnessed the arrival of the Roman troops, and the departure of those of Herod. The populace of Beth-Harem were VOL. I. 19 much stirred, when they beheld the soldiers of their own prince giving way before the arrival of those of their oppressors. As it was known both by couriers, who had gone before, and by the distant clouds of dust and sounds of martial music, that the Romans were actually approaching, the inhabitants of the town poured forth, both for the purpose of beholding the scene and of giving vent to their displeasure in insults and reproaches. We also repaired to the plains, just without the walls, and standing beneath the shade of the groves, which on this side the town everywhere encompass it, to which the inhabitants constantly resort for their recreations during the warmer days of summer, we awaited the approach of the soldiers. While here we perceived, that the people were well disposed to stir up strife whenever the soldiers should appear, to which they were diligently encouraged by many of the chief citizens, who, not less than the rabble of this strange people, seem ever ready for tumult, though nothing be to be gained thereby. They seem to have no control over their passions or of their expression, but utter freely whatever they conceive in their minds, regardless of the possible or probable consequences, which such rashness may draw after it. As we stood conversing we observed a large multitude posting themselves before the gates of the town, as if by merely placing themselves there, they could obstruct the entrance of an armed force, while the most that could happen would be throwing an obstacle in their way for a few moments, in doing which many might in the confusion be trampled to death, while no possible benefit could accrue. Nor were the Priests and Rulers of the Synagogue, Shammai and Zadok, ashamed to be among them, giving edge to their passions by their gestures and language. Zadok — the more zealous of the two, whom I had before seen in Beth-Harem on the Sabbath — when he had sufficiently bestowed his counsel on the rabble, came toward us, just then when by the braying of instruments and the neighing of horses we knew that the Romans were at hand. “Well met, Onias,” he cried, as he joined us hot with his exertions, and covered with dust, “and you too, Sir Roman — and — laying his hand on his breast, or rather on his beard, which swept over it, and bending his head toward Judith — thou also, fair Rose of Sharon; but, daughter, there will be dust on thy leaves if thou standest here, and that too from filthy Roman feet. Get thee farther back, child. Look to this flower, Onias, let it not be soiled.” “Mind not me,” said Judith; “it is not dust from without that is to be feared, even though it be from Roman feet. A breath blows it off again.” The priest cast a quick glance at the girl, as if suspecting a hidden meaning in her words. Judith immediately added, as if she had said nothing that had deserved attention, “Why, Zadok, dost thou set thyself to inflame the people more than is their nature? Their hearts are already bitter enough, methinks.” “An eye for an eye, young woman,” he answered, “as thy princely father would say also, and this young cousin of thine too if his face is to be read aright. An eye for an eye! Would it could be an eye for an eye. But it will be a long day before the Jew can do upon the gentile what he hath done upon the Jew. But a long day will have its end, and, may I be one to see it. There come the idolaters! See their pride in scarlet and horses, in armor and in music! Ah, if the sight of a mole is given me, their bones shall never rest in the sepulchres of their Fathers. Who is he at their head, sitting forsooth as if he were Cæsar himself?” One who stood by cried out, “That is Saturninus the Centurion.” While he spoke, various outcries arose from the people, while some brandished their arms in a threatening manner, or else sticks and branches broken from the trees, and others scraping up the dust in their hands threw it into the air, or hurled it against the soldiers. Just as the Centurion was passing where we stood, he could clearly perceive, that the entrance to the city was wholly obstructed by a crowd of not men only but women and children also, who thronged the way. Although from the insults heaped upon him on every side he could not but learn what was the temper of the people, yet he evidently did not suppose, that the dense body of people before him was gathered there for any other purpose than to witness his entrance, for waving his sword, while he put no check on the pace of his horse, he made a signal as if the way should be cleared, and as if expecting it would instantly be obeyed. But no movement followed. On the contrary the people pressed more closely together and increased their cries of rage. Whereupon the troops were ordered to stand still, who, though they were set upon in a thousand ways of ignominious assault, yet took no note of it save to utter in under tones fierce and bitter curses. The Centurion now advanced alone toward the crowd, and speaking to them in calm and manly tones begged them “not to hinder him in his entrance into the city; he did not come to do them any 19 * injury, but on the contrary, while he should remain among them, hoped to be a friend to them, and protect them against any evil that might threaten; perhaps he should remain but for a brief space, when the troops of Herod would be restored; if they would retire and allow him a free and easy passage, and if those who had command among them would persuade the youths and others to intermit their violence, he would promise to do them no harm nor suffer any of his soldiers to take any revenge for injuries already committed; but otherwise he might not be able to restrain their fury.” To this speech they answered only by fresh outcries and filling the air with dust. Perceiving then that the obstinacy of the people was not to be overcome, Saturninus returned to where we were standing, together with many others of the principal citizens. Singling out Onias without difficulty as chief of them all, he besought him to aid him in his peaceful endeavors, that he might not be compelled to betake himself to measures of force, which he should be sorry to resort to, not less than others would be to witness or suffer them. “It must be easily in the power of such as you seem to be,” he said, “to divert from their purpose a multitude of obstinate persons, who can certainly have no expectation of either fighting or overcoming, and are only indulging their passions to our great vexation and shame.” Before Onias could utter a word in reply, Zadok shouted forth, “Oh! press on noble Roman! There is a manly victory before thee. There stand the women and little children of our city. Ride over them with thy steel-hoofed horses, and historians shall chronicle thy deeds. As thou didst in Cæsarca, do here — ride swiftly, kill and slay.” “Thou misjudgest Romans,” replied Saturninus with mildness, “if thou thinkest we would hurt the unarmed and helpless. But surely it is more than foolish to encourage the people in these mad insults, which can at best have no other end than to convert into enemies those who now are friends and well disposed to remain so; but what thou wilt not do another will, and the gods be thanked.” These last words he said as he beheld Onias hasten towards the gate, accompanied by others, and make signs for the people to disperse. As the Centurion saw there was a hesitation among the crowd, some being disposed to yield and end their idle display of rage, he gave the order to his troop to advance at a good pace. Whereupon the whole body, nothing loth, set forward to the sound of their trumpets, and at a quicker pace too than they knew was intended, which had the desired effect; for no sooner had they approached in this manner near the crowd, quickening their motion more and more, than the terror of the sight, and the fear of being trampled to death by those whom they knew they had filled with anger, caused them to scatter in great confusion on either side of the highway, many falling and rolling over each other, to the great entertainment both of the Romans and of all who beheld it; not a few hardly escaping from under the feet of the horse; nor would have done so but for the forbearance of the riders. Without further hindrance, then, they rode on to their quarters in the midst of the city. As the last of them passed within the gates, we turned away towards thy brother's, Shammai and Zadok accompanying us. “Ah,” said Zadok, as we walked along, “doth it not grieve the heart of a son of the freeman Abraham, who wandered to and fro from Dan to Beersheba without let or hindrance whithersoever he would, and when it pleased him went even unto Egypt, his wife Sarah with him, and when it pleased him came back again, calling no man master, being a slave to no one, doth it not, I say, grieve the heart of one of this generation, to behold how we are fallen into this accursed slavery to the gentile — our towns held by his soldiers, our steps dogged by his taxgatherers?” “Yet,” said Judith, “is it better to wait the Lord's time for our deliverance than seek it by our wisdom and strength. He hath promised, and the promise will be kept.” — “Yea, young maiden, as in the synagogue I have oft affirmed — to which thine ears I joy to perceive have not been closed. He hath promised indeed, and even in our day do we look for the fulfilment. Moses hath spoken of the salvation, and all the prophets. But holy Daniel — hath he not in words not to be doubted or gainsaid, as I will show thee —” “Therefore, Rabbi, what I would say,” gently interposed Judith, — willing to avert the threatened rehearsal, “is, that seeing the promises have been given, which because given of Jehovah will be kept, ought we not to wait rather in patience times which he hath appointed for our redemption, than strive to hasten them by acts of our own. We are as the blind when we aim to look into the designs of infinite intelligence; and as children who should think to move Mount Hermon, when we do aught in the hope to hinder or hasten them.” Zadok scowled at these words of Judith, but added, “What the Lord hath done in the days past of our history to the gentile, and the worshippers of idols, to such as gave themselves to the worship of Baal and Moloch, and even to their priests, killing and slaying, he hath taught his people to do. How oft by his prophets of old did he send them forth to destroy his despisers from off the face of the Earth.” “Doubtless,” replied Judith, “it is that for which I would have our people now wait. Let the Prophet who is to come, and for whom we now wait, appear, and whither he shall lead let us follow, and what he shall command, let us do. But while he comes not, let us withhold our hand. It is his bidding that shall make deeds innocent, which without shall be black with guilt.” “Thy words,” here interposed Shammai, “are as those of the wise king of Israel — they are as apples of gold in pictures of silver.” Judith perceived as she thought a hidden reproach in the words of the Rabbi, and feeling as if in her earnestness she had offended against what was due to her elder, her face was covered with blushes and fell upon her breast as she said; “nay, Rabbi, I meant not to teach, but only to speak for the cause of present peace. Surely it can be of no avail that the scenes of Cæsarea should be repeated in Beth-Harem. We there lost those whom we greatly loved, yet hath their loss brought no profit to our nation. The power against which we would contend is too mighty to resist, if God be not on our side. Alas! Father, forgive me; I fear I teach again” — and the fair girl covered her face with her hands. “We need,” said Shammai in gentler tones, “to be rather forgiven of thee. They who hold of Judas are apt to be of a harsh and hasty speech, which must make our peace with thee, my daughter. We are a fierce and contentious race.” We had now reached the dwelling of Onias. When we had entered, Judith hastened to offer for our refreshment delicious grapes with pitchers of wine just from the presses and water cooled with the snows of Lebanon. To the Rulers she presented with her own hands the bunches that were ripest, and fairest, and poured out for them the new wine, mingling with it both snow and water. Their spirit was greatly softened by the services of Judith, and by the cooling effects of the fruit and wine, and Shammai holding up the cup from which he had drank, and looking intently at its proportions said; “Verily, Onias, the cunning of man is like the cunning of Him who made him. How many are his devices for our comfort and adornment. Here is this cup of silver curiously wrought, from Rome I doubt not; these carpets from Persia; these rich hangings from Damascus; these couches of silk from the farther India. Wisdom, saith Solomon, is better than silver, or gold, or rubies. Yea, O wise man, so it is. Yet these are good nevertheless, and thou wast too wise to give them bad names. So again he saith, there is nothing better for a man in this life, than that he should eat and drink, which is also a wise saying. We may well call that wise which simply describeth a natural thing. It needed not he should have eaten so good grapes or drunk so good wine as these to have taught him that. Every man will say it, who in the morning riseth and findeth nothing better than a cake baked on the coals, with a piece of honey. As I think, it is only when a man eats or drinks that he can say his soul is without trouble. Verily he is righteous overmuch, as the great king saith, and one greatly impertinent moreover, who, like the foolish Essenes, seeketh to please God by refusing with contempt the good things he hath taken the pains to create, and cause the earth to bring forth for his entertainment. It would be right, that such an one in the resurrection should be defrauded of his expectations. He, that despiseth what the Lord hath made and pronounced good, should himself be despised and his portion taken from him. Daughter, this wine is good. Yes — that is what I would have — let it be filled once more. Onias, who is this Saturninus, as some one called him, whom we are to have to rule over us?” Onias replied, that he knew not. “Perhaps then,” continued the ruler, “our young Roman knoweth him.” To this I answered, that I knew only his name, that he was of a good family (the family, my mother, of M. Scævola Saturninus) and had served with credit in the army. “May he and his army perish,” cried Zadok, “ere they leave the walls of Beth-Harem.” “In the mean while,” said Onias, “it were better that the people trouble him not. What is done, let it be done, not as to-day.” “Ah, Onias, I see thee. Thou wouldst take them by craft, thou wouldst catch them by subtlety.” “I would not catch them at all,” Onias replied; “but let them dwell among us in peace. When the time cometh it will be seen that it is come. I shall trust to see this same Saturninus and know him.” So we conversed of many things, till Shammai, bethinking himself of affairs that required his presence, took his departure, Zadok accompanying him. The elder of the two rulers — VOL. I. 20 Shammai — is one whom for many things both Judith and Onias esteem; while for other reasons they think but lightly of him. He is, if one may say so, a sort of Epicurean in a Jew's dress — and among what nation, tribe, or religion is not the Epicurean to be found? The dispositions which nature hath given him are such as inspire affection; but the boldness with which he administers the office of ruler of the synagogue, while in his heart he doubts or disbelieves the faith of which he makes so open a profession, causeth him to be treated not so much as a friend whom they can admit to their entire confidence and love, as one whose cheerful presence and discourse add greatly to the pleasures of any society of which he makes a part. His years ensure him reverence. Judith, indeed, having known him from a child, doth more than reverence him. Of Zadok thou shalt hear another time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IX. The longer I remain among this people, my mother, the more strange do they seem; but the more too do I become bound to them, and especially to the members of this household. They are a people beyond any other religious, and yet, as I suppose, beyond any other superstitious and wicked; which seems to proceed from this, that they make distinctions between the worship of God, and virtue; and consider these two things as not necessarily joined together. Not but what the same error is to be observed elsewhere, but that here it appears to be more universal. Prayers are made upon all occasions, and in all places, but they are a ceremony by themselves; and being once said, the matter is over; so much was due to God by command, agreement, or custom, or tradition, and the debt has been paid. Then how their life shall be ordered is another affair, and governed by interests, rules, and motives which belong to itself. Some who are esteemed to stand at the head of the religion, and who generally are of the Pharisees, are as remarkable for their want of goodness, or rather as notorious for their vices, as for their piety toward God shown in a strict observance of the Sabbath and the least points of the Law. So long as religion shall be held as somewhat distinct from virtue must it continue to be so; and so long will the faith in one God, in which we may justly boast over all other nations, be little better for the interests of goodness than the Roman's faith in many. But at the same time is it true, that some have been instructed even as it was my fortune to be by thee. Their religion hath been connected with their life; their many prayers and fastings, their sacrifices and offerings, their goings up to the feasts, their observance of the law to its smallest requirement in every outward rite and act, has all been done not in the place of virtue, but in addition and as incentives to it. Of this sort I need hardly say to thee are Onias and Judith. They are careful observers of the law; but while exact in the mere ceremonial part, they are even more exact in what pertains to righteousness. Nay, they would by many be thought to neglect observances on which others greatly pride themselves, though none can be found to charge them with any infringement of the greater matters of the law. The hypocrisies and over-righteousness of the Pharisees are not theirs, nor the indifference of the Sadducees. They believe in Moses and the Prophets — in the law that guides them in this life, and in the resurrection at the last day, for which the law fits them by its commands. But they pretend not to more than they have. They are content to do what to them seems necessary, without seeking to gain the admiration of others by extraordinary acts of piety and the observance of all the lesser points of the law. Truly, their lives are beautiful. Onias indeed oftentimes seems severe and harsh; but he is a just man and fears God, and serves him in that very way which to him seems right. The law withlb&gt; the traditions, which are its interpretation, are to him the lights — the greater and the lesser, by which he draws every breath and shapes every step in life. He asks for no more or better. He sees no defect, there is nothing incomplete to be supplied. If the law were truly kept, Israel, he says, would rise to her proper glory, and would overshadow the whole earth, — prosperity and riches and love and glory would make the land of Judea the wonder of the earth, and the seat of an everlasting kingdom, for its felicity, like the paradise of the first pair. 20* Judith, though her reverence for the law is great, and though she reads diligently the prophets, and observes their precepts, and performs the required rights, is yet secretly sad and unsatisfied. So much have I gathered, not from any set disclosure she hath made of her thoughts, but rather from the language of her countenance, from words that have dropped from her, and yet more from what she hath not said when certain subjects have formed the matter of discourse. With the rest of the people she is anxiously dwelling on what the future shall reveal, but differing from them, her hopes are of some one, who shall prove himself to be a reformer of the manners of her nation, as much and as well as the subduer of her enemies. She thinks that the medicine needed is partly that which shall purge the heart. So that when she speaks of the Messiah, it is as a prophet and a priest that she delights chiefly to regard him. She asks for a teacher and a guide, who shall lead her farther into a knowledge of God and of things invisible, than she can now penetrate. The priests of the law do not give her what she asks — the law itself is dark and refuses to speak of the things of which she desires most to learn. The harp of David, though the music is sweet, and all the tones it speaks find an accordant response in her soul, yet are not its notes enough to answer one by one to the wants she feels. The harmony is not complete. For myself, my mother, I judge that this people want liberty first — truth afterwards. The truths for which a soul like Judith's sighs would fall on stony ground falling upon the hearts of slaves. In the slave the thoughts are bound as well as the limbs. They cannot think or feel as men, who cannot move and act as men. The outward bondage becomes necessarily one that is inward also, seeing the body and the mind are one. Is it not in vain therefore to look for any great advantages to come from a prophet, who shall not first appear and act in the character of a deliverer and conqueror? So thinks Onias, and so thinks the nation. When the looked-for Messiah shall appear, it is certain, so judges the whole people, that he will appear as one who shall first of all bring deliverance to the captive, and a ransom for such as are under bonds; nor can any signs in heaven or on earth show the approach of the true Shiloh, but such as proclaim him prince and conqueror. How astonishing the news I hear through thy letters and the common channels of the present ascendency and power of Sejanus! With any due proportion of humanity and modesty it is not to be doubted, that he might have founded a name and authority that might have overshadowed Tiberius. But, surely, the gods having now decreed his destruction have made him mad. Is it possible Romans should endure such remorseless cruelties? What a fate is this of a city and empire like Rome, — with an emperor buried in a desert island, old in years and older in crime, feebler through lust and intemperance than through age, the object of universal detestation, yet ruling these many millions with the mere breath of his mouth, and besides him, this second self in Rome, carrying on his own schemes of cruelty and ambition, pleasing his great master in proportion to his excesses, since the iniquity of the satellite serves as a shield for that of the principal. When will the justice of God overtake such wickedness? You are alarmed, my mother, at such language, lest spies and informers should bear it to the secret tribunals of power. Be not afraid. My letters are entrusted to none but known and faithful hands. Besides we are not of the noble Roman families. We are not a mark high enough for the emperor or his tool. Nevertheless read them in secrecy, with doors and windows closed; and then carefully conceal or destroy them. The coming to Beth-Harem of C. Sentius Saturninus, my mother, has, both to the inhabitants of the city and to us of the household of Onias, proved anything rather than an evil. His presence, together with his soldiers, has acted as a wholesome restraint on the licentious rabble, and the quarrelsome factions within the walls, keeping or restoring peace where Herod's authority was wont oftentimes to fail; and to us he shows himself well disposed to cultivate our society and friendship, and make himself of service in many ways. When the duties of his office allow him a season of recreation, he seeks the precincts of thy brother's dwelling, and either walking up and down on the banks of the Jordan in company with thy son and niece, sitting under the vine-covered arbor, of which I have told thee, or else at the table, partaking of the hospitality of Onias, we have enjoyed many hours of agreeable intercourse. He is youthful for the rank he holds, but his great merit in campaigns, both in Germany and the East, have won for him early advancement. The qualities of his heart are as remarkable, as those of his intellect; so that even in the army he has been called the good Centurion. If rigorous in preserving discipline, he is not unnecessarily severe. His justice may always be relied upon; and when he punishes, it is against the feelings of his nature; he would pardon if it could be done with safety. It was the last Sabbath that Onias made a supper for Saturninus, at which sat down many guests besides. Shammai, Eliel, Zadok, and Eleazer, rulers, and doctors of the law from Beth Harem were also there. The house was bright with the multitude of lamps, and the tables bent beneath the wealth both of the service and of the meats with which it was loaded. Music was added to the entertainment, which came to us not too loud nor yet too faint, from a neighboring apartment; and as the feast drew to a close, there were gathered on the grounds before the dwelling other members of the household, the servants, the husbandmen, and all of every other humble office belonging to this great vine-dresser, where to the sound of the timbrel, pipe, and harp, and by the light of the fading day and the new moon, they joined in dances common to the inhabitants of the country. When we had sat at the tables the usual time, we then resorted to the portico and the rooms overlooking the Jordan, where for our entertainment we either watched the movements of the rustic dance, or fell into such discourse as our thoughts were led to by the time and place, and the objects around us. “Thus it is,” said Saturninus to Judith, “that you of Judea keep your day of worship. It is not so with your people, as I think, in Rome.” “So it may seem,” said Judith, “because there by the necessary confinement of a city, our usages are not made visible to every eye as here, and you, I doubt, were never, when in Rome, within the dwelling of a Jew.” “I must confess,” replied the Centurion, “I never was; but I can truly affirm that this has not been because of any hostility which I have entertained toward your nation, but simply because chance never threw me into their society.” “I doubt not your word,” replied Judith. “If it had been your fortune to have mingled with us in Rome, you would have found I may presume to say mainly the same observances there as here; for we are to a wonder the same people the earth over. How say you, Julian? for your testimony must be beyond dispute.” I said that it was certainly so. “The stranger, however,” observed Saturninus, conceives of this day as if it were rather a day of fasting and worship alone.” “It is far otherwise,” answered Judith. “We worship indeed on this day, and we rest from labor, as do also our cattle and servants; but otherwise it is a day of feasting, not of fasting. It must be the strictness with which labor of every kind is prohibited which hath given origin to the feeling you have expressed. Labor is indeed absolutely forbidden — that is the great end of the appointment. Our merciful law hath taken good care of the humble and the poor in this, that the rich and the great cannot deprive them, nor even the more helpless dumb beast of this repose. No man however great in Israel dares compel the toil, or even permit it, of man, woman, or animal. This you will allow is both wise and merciful.” “It is indeed,” replied the Roman. “I wish that in this point at least, the law of the Jew were also the law of the Roman and of the world.” “But” continued Judith laughing, “so exacting is our law on this point, that were you, Saturninus, to become one of us, and were so much as to break the law in the least iota, even by bearing your sword or lance from one place to another, we should stone you even to death.” “Alas then,” replied Saturninus, “I can never be a Jew. But I suppose you speak but in jest.” “Well,” said Judith, “we are not so savage or so strict now. If you will become a proselyte, I can promise you an easier yoke. Nay for that, some of our doctors make it light enough. But that must not be heard by our Rulers. Shammai's voice happily shields us. We need not fear being overheard, when he hath the argument.” A loud burst of merriment from the group of dancers before us here for a moment interrupted our conversation. Judith, springing from her seat and beholding the gayety of the peasants, their wives, and children, could not be restrained from joining them, but saying that she would return soon bounded along the portico and down the flight of steps and in a moment was in the midst of them the merriest and most agile of all. Such an example being given, I was not slow to do likewise, so that till we were well wearied with our exertions we continued to mingle with the dancers and partake their pleasures. The delight which the accession of Judith to their numbers occasioned, — whom all of her servants and dependents seem so to love that her service is their highest pleasure, — was very manifest in the increased hilarity with which they engaged in their sport as soon as she became one of them. When we returned to the Portico, Saturninus was seated and conversing with the Doctors, whom we also joined. They had been evidently talking of the synagogue, for Saturninus was inquiring of Shammai, why the stranger from Enon had that morning been denied the privilege which he sought of speaking to the people, while others were freely allowed. “Should a man,” answered Zadok before Shammai could find his words, “who is a follower VOL. I. 21 of one that is reported to be rather in the keeping of an evil spirit than of his own, be allowed to speak in the name of the Lord? It is not every one, though he may esteem himself wise and as one of the elders, whom we are ready to take at his own word. It was not hard to guess with what new insolence he would have entertained our ears.” “Nevertheless,” said Eleazer, “I would gladly have heard what it was he was so swollen with. His own mouth, I doubt not, would have condemned him more than any reproof of ours.” “So without doubt it might have been,” interrupted the bitter voice of Zadok, “but so it might not have been, and had the bag of wind once found vent, who can tell what blasphemies would have flowed abroad, to seduce, and deceive, and pollute the hearer? What John hath done, he would have striven to do.” “His mouth was well stopped,” said the other. “Aye,” said Eliel, “it was — for the people would have heard him gladly.” “I should not marvel, if on the next Sabbath,” said Eleazer, “they clamored more still to hear him.” “Let them clamor,” replied Zadok, “they are neither rulers nor doctors, nor will all their uproar make them so. There are the streets and the highways; let him use them, and none will hinder. Ere the next Sabbath it were no wonder if the half-witted populace of Beth-Harem took him for the Christ himself, as I hear in the region of Genessareth they begin to do his master.” “So it is indeed reported as I learn,” said Eleazer, “but it is reported also that he says plainly he is not the Christ.” “He saith it to-day mayhap,” rejoined Zadok, “but let the folly of the people in those parts increase, as it is the nature of folly to do, and carry greater crowds than now to his Baptism, and we shall see what his meekness will do. His sordid attire, his fastings and prayers are the gins and snares to catch fools, and when the multitude of them hath sufficiently grown, he will have cheated himself, as well as them, into an opinion of his own greatness he did not at first entertain. Fools make fools.” “It were well methinks,” said Shammai, “if there were not so many others to set gins and snares of the same sort to cheat those whose sight is small. If John catches the people in that way, he is not the first who by fastings and long prayers has gotten a good opinion among the people, which, if they could have seen behind the veil of his prayers into his deeds, might not have retained its fragrant odor.” It was easy to see at whom Shammai shot his shaft, for Zadok's brow grew darker and his lips drew back from his long teeth as he said; “It is no crime to observe the Law of Moses even to a tything of mint and cummin, that I have ever heard. The blessing of Jehovah is upon such. The law is the law, and it is not kept except it be kept.” “Most true, Rabbi,” said Shammai, “In respect of the rites of the Law, they are delivered with exactness and are kept but in one manner. In respect of other things we have choice. They are not so weighty. In them justice may be put by for a time; so did David. The Jew, who should strive to be more than he, surely would seek to be righteous overmuch.” Zadok stroked his beard but answered not. “But if that be truth,” continued Shammai, “which we have lately heard, the world will not long be afflicted with either the wisdom or the folly of this madman, if he be indeed a madman.” “What is it? what is it?” said Zadok reviving. “Why this,” said the Ruler, “that he is thrusting himself into Herod's affairs, which is much as if he leaped into a lion's den.” “That is news indeed!” replied the other. “Ha! ha! I had not heard it. But what is it he hath done? Let us hear.” “Behold now,” said Shammai, “how this learned Doctor scenteth evil afar off and snuffeth up the odor thereof as of a pleasant sacrifice. It were a charity to his soul not to answer him. Why is the heart made to delight in misfortunes of others and vent curses on them? The Jew by his nature, young Roman, curses thee and all thy people.” “As I judge,” replied Saturninus, “it is the Jew that curses, and not the man who lives under the Jew. A Jew infant reared in Rome would not speak such curses. It is your law that shuts your hearts against the love of others. Nature has no such tuition.” “No, Saturninus,” quickly interrupted Judith, “it is not our Law so much as the traditions which have supplanted it. True it is, our people were made the instrument to destroy impure and idolatrous tribes, and have been instructed not to mix with any nations, worshippers of many gods. But this was, that a purer religion might be preserved among one people at least, that should be a pattern to the rest of mankind. The Jewish is the only people who cleave to one God, without image or picture through which to adore him, or by which to conceive of him.” 21 * “What is it he hath done, Shammai,” said Zadok, with impatience, “what is it he hath done? let us know.” “That is true,” rejoined Saturninus. “But it has availed little to mankind that you have held a better faith, while a spirit so hostile toward others hath prevailed. For men are little inclined to copy those whom they hate, or by whom they are hated.” “Doubtless that is so,” said Onias, “but the truth hath been too great to be wholly destroyed in that way. Just as the sun shines through dark clouds and thick mists, so hath this truth shone through all our errors, vices, and wickedness, and cast some light upon those who were sitting in darkness. We have hindered it much, but not altogether. Our commerce, and even our wars have served to carry it abroad.” “Yea,” said Shammai, “that is so; but after all that hath been done for us, and in spite of the law and our worship, the Jewish world is but as any other. Jerusalem smells not sweeter, I fear me, to the Lord, than Rome or Alexandria.” “The man is mad,” quoth Zadok, “and speaketh blasphemy. Verily, Shammai, it were a righteous act to cast thee out of the synagogue.” “Then,” said the ruler, “would there be at length a chance of my amendment. A man is rarely better than his companions.” “Hear him!” said Zadok, “Hear his railings! But cease now, and let it be known what thou hast heard of John.” “It is this only, that he raves madly against Herod for what he is reported to purpose concerning Philip's wife. The king, trusting to have ended his iniquity in peace ere it got much abroad is now as mad as he.” “Ah! that is good!” cried Zadok. “Now we shall see what a prophet can do against a king. Now we shall see how this tanner from Enon will bear himself on the Sabbath.” “Nay, they may claim thus much at our hand,” said Shammai, “both John and his disciples, that they are bold and fear no one, — and that is a prophet's mark.” “Now,” cried Zadok, “let us sing hosannas. Shammai holds John to be a prophet! Let us report it in Beth-Harem — Shammai, the learned doctor and ruler of the Synagogue, that stands between the market and the citadel, and which once heard the voice of great Hillel, Shammai, the Hebrew, the Greek, the Philosopher, follows after John of Hebron with an uncombed beard, unwashen hands, a beggar's robe, and a leathern girdle about his loins” — “The grinding of millstones,” cried Shammai interrupting the hoarse sound, “the braying of asses, the shrieking of the wind among the dry cedars of the Dead Sea, the creaking of the wine press, are not to be named, Zadok, with the shrill trumpet of thy voice. Thou needest not repeat thy proclamation, for it has already been heard beyond the walls of Beth-Harem.” With these sayings, partly in jest, and as it seemed to me partly in earnest, these learned scribes and rulers took their departure, and returned to the city. When they were gone, it being still early, and the sounds of the dancers and their music being over, we continued sitting and conversing. “These priests and rulers,” said Saturninus, “take life lightly, if one may judge them by their words. They seem each as if two persons, the one light and sportful and open, the other standing back, close, secret, and dark. They appeared not to utter their true thoughts, but to be playing with the subjects that came up.” “It is partly so, indeed,” said Judith, “as perhaps with all of us, at least with very many of us, we are one thing to the eye, one thing on the surface, but another quite to him who hath sight to see beyond, and wit to draw up what is there in the greater depths. Sometimes the outer clothing is the fairer and better, but often it covers over a worthier thing than itself, and conceals it from all but those gifted with a sharper, and more penetrating vision.” “Yet,” continued Saturninus, “in one thing they seemed to agree, in showing dislike of the prophet, who is said to have risen up, and to have commenced the labors of a reformer. But why should one be feared, who comes only as a teacher of virtue?” “The rulers dislike and oppose him,” said Onias, “not because he is a prophet, if indeed he be one, but because he is not more of one. The common people, as you may have been told, crowd his steps and hear him gladly. They are caught with every one who sets up a pretension like this.” “But,” said the Roman, “even if he were no more than a reformer of the morals of a people, were I a Jew, I should receive him gladly. It were a happy day for Rome, could some one arise whom the gods should fill with a spirit and a power to waken her from her slumbers of death. There are many there, whose prayer to the gods is, morning and evening, at home and in the temples, for more knowledge and light. For the darkness now is one that may be felt. The people still worship the ancient gods with faith in them more or less. But the learned and the thoughtful ask for a better religion than their ancestors have bequeathed, ere they can give it their belief and their obedience. We are buried in mysterious gloom. We grope as blind men, not knowing whence we come nor whither we go. We have an instinct, which teaches the reality of some Cause equal to the production of this broad world, and the overhanging sun and stars. But we know him not; we know not how to conceive of him, nor in what manner with most acceptance to approach him, save that here also our instincts serve us somewhat, but guide each one a different way. What we mean by virtue, we are persuaded with some general conviction, must be the most pleasing offering we can bring to the altar of the Supreme God; but we know not in what proportion we should bring him that offering, or others of prayer, sacrifices, garlands, and music; moreover we cannot tell how to think of our life, what it is, and when to terminate — of death, what it is, and to what with certainty it bears us. So that we of Rome long for nothing more than for a teacher and reformer, who should by his genius exercise authority over the minds of men, and by divine inspirations pour into them the light of truth. I would give an ear even to one of not more promise than this wanderer in the wildernesses of Jordan, seeing that perchance he may be filled with a divine spirit — for it would appear that we are not able of ourselves, who see so little way, to say in what manner and with what appearances a messenger from God would approach us.” “It is to me,” said Judith, “a pleasure to hear such opinions. Dwelling, even as I do, under a religious law, which hath the true God for its author, even I desire a knowledge superior to that which now, as a people we possess. And with many, with multitudes in our unhappy country, I wait for the redemption of Israel, for a new comforting of the people of God. And with certainty do we look for a teacher, who shall complete and perfect the law now given to us, and establish us in a condition of virtue and happiness, as well as of outward glory, we now cannot so much as dream of. Night and day, day and night, do prayers go up from this whole people, from the sinner as well as the saint, from the child on its mother's knee, as well as from him who is standing on the borders of his grave, that God would please to cause a new day to rise upon us, and his kingdom to come and be established in the midst of us. I cannot then but look with expectation toward every one who approaches and gives any signs that God is with him. What to think of John I know not, nor do others, as it would seem. The common people, who in some things see clearest — would not God endow them with a sense to know his messenger when he should come — follow after him, as we hear, daily in increasing numbers, and by baptism are enrolled among his disciples. Would he were in this region, that I might hear for myself and judge for myself.” “My dear child,” said Onias, “think not of John, nor of any great thing as to come of him. He is nought, stark nought. I too at first looked toward him with expectation, or rather with a wondering curiosity, but God is not with him. He too is a deceiver, or deceived, like so many who have gone before him. In the early days of thy mother Eunice all Judea was stirred from its lowest depths, yet it proved in the end but a delusion of Satan.” “Of whom and of what speak you,” I asked. “Doubtless the knowledge of what I would speak of never reached thy ears, for it was before thou sawest the light. I speak of the child born at Bethlehem.” “Not even a rumor,” said I, “hath ever reached me.” “It fell out in the latter part of the reign of the great Herod. I even was but a child.” “Herod I know; and of him heard much at Cæsarea; but not of what you now name.” “Surely,” said Judith, “have I heard from my mother, in my youth, tales of the wonderful child born at Nazareth or Bethlehem — born too I remember me in the stable of an inn, whom kings came and worshipped. The rest is gone from me, or has mixed itself with a thousand such tales from the far East.” “In Jerusalem and all the neighboring parts,” said Onias, “as indeed throughout Judea, have fables, — some with portions of truth intermingled, passed from mouth to mouth. I then, as I have said, was but a child, yet did many things fall upon my ear, which sank in and have not since departed. But I rather speak of what afterwards came to my knowledge. All Jerusalem was at that time in great expectation of the immediate appearing of the Messiah, and ready to convert anything beyond the facts of every day into a wonder. Among a thousand rumors no one knew what to believe, and the events since that day have shown that there was nothing to be believed. But the stories handed down assert the birth of a child, as thou hast said, Judith, in the stable of an inn of Bethlehem, — whose parents were strangers of Nazareth in Galilee, — and whose birth was declared to some shepherds in the neighborhood of the town by a vision of angels. As I think, and as many thought then, what those peasants saw was in their dream. Yet so confidently VOL. I. 22 was the vision reported, and beside that, the appearance of a bright star, pointing to the very spot where the child lay, that many believed, and it came to be a rumor throughout the city and all the parts round about, that he who was to be King of the Jews was at last born. This coming soon, as it could hardly fail to do, to the ears of Herod, alarmed him not a little; for it was not unknown to him, that the people were constantly looking when this future king should come and assume his throne. Nay, there were not wanting flatterers, who persuaded Herod that he himself was the looked for Messiah. But he believed them not. Yet not being ready to surrender his power into the hands of any other, and fearing, lest there might be some truth in the tales which were passing from one to another, and filled the city, he, according to his nature, determined upon a cruel measure for allaying his apprehensions; for he gave sudden and secret orders for all the children in Bethlehem to be seized and slaughtered, that so the new-born king might perish with them. Yet the order was not so secretly given, but that a warning came to many in season, who escaped the intended destruction. Among them, it was affirmed by some, was the young child, though by others it was asserted that it had perished. But since, it has been well known that they fled — the parents and the child — to their native place, where they have dwelt, he who was to be a king, quite forgetting his high dignity, living and laboring humbly enough, subject to his father as a carpenter. Wherefore the wonders related of his birth are thus shown to be delusions or worse. The only thing we know to have been real was the destruction of innocent children by the king, of which the parents of the child were the cause, either by their own acts and delusions, or the delusions and acts of others, which they could not prevent. Their own safety they effected, but left behind others miserably to perish through their means.” “This is a strange story,” said I. “Not so strange to us,” replied Onias, “who are ever greedy of what is marvellous, and who dwell on the borders of the land of fables.” “Who,” asked Judith, “were these people from Nazareth, that they should pretend to the glory of being parents of the Messiah? Is it not our belief, that he shall come of the House of David? Surely their lineage might be traced.” “So much was true,” replied Onias. “It was found, that they were in truth of that family, though poor and unknown.” “What, father, was the name they bore?” asked Judith. “I have forgotten,” answered Onias; “nor do I remember that of the child; though among other feigned things it was sent abroad, that an angel had announced the name by which it should be called. “Were there many who gave their faith to such pretences?” I asked. “It cannot be denied,” said Onias, “that very many believed, and more waited in hope to see what might come of it. But the more wise and prudent saw not, in any of the things affirmed, the signs that should fitly announce the Messiah of Judea. Especially was it clear, that he, upon whose shoulders was to rest the government of Israel and of the world, would not first breathe in the feeding trough of a camel. It is not so kings are born; much less the King of kings. How should the people of God know their sovereign in such a form, and how should they be guilty, should they reject or destroy him? After a time no more was heard of this wonder of Bethlehem; and by the generations of to-day it is forgotten that such events have been.” “So, you will have us to believe,” I said, “will it be with this John of Hebron.” “That,” Onias replied, “is what I would say. The signs of Judea's deliverer are not more in this baptizing wanderer of the wilderness than they were in that peasant's child. And when the people have run after him, and fed their foolish hopes on chaff, they will return to themselves, and wait. Many times have our hopes been cast down, and they will be again if in our folly we fasten them on this new preacher. A good man he may be, but no more. He who is to come hath not yet come; nevertheless he may not be far off, but standing in the midst of us while our eyes see him not. John indeed speaks of one to follow him. But neither is it he.” Saying this, Onias rose and withdrew. When he was gone Judith said, “My father will not believe until such an one appears as he looketh for, and John is far from that. But so I, Julian, cannot judge. Are we to say how a messenger of God shall manifest himself to men, or what form, whether that of a servant or a king, his Messiah shall take? Alas! for me a king were a small gift indeed. What to me were it if David again came forth from the grave, or his greater son, or any of the Prophets, and erected here in Judea the throne which so many are impatient to behold? Of what avail were such an one to me? My soul — and, Julian, I am not alone — hungers for somewhat more nutritious, that can feed and support a higher life than that of the body — for an entertainment 22* richer and more divine than could ever be had in a king's palace. We have kings now, and courts of luxury. I could resort to Herod, or Pilate, or Philip, but what should I find there that I want?” “But, dear Judith,” said I, “do you not now in saying this yourself commit the error which you have just noted in Onias? He turns away from this wild man of the wilderness, this son of thunder, this unlettered and humble child of nature, this stern preacher of righteousness, because he does not agree with the picture he has formed in his mind of the Prophet whom God will send, when he sends forth his Messiah; and do not you also make your own thought the measure of what God shall do, when you refuse your homage to a king? Yet, surely, when the prophets speak of him who is to come, it is of one who is to govern Israel, and rule over the kingdom of David — it is ever of the Christ, as King.” “Yes, Julian,” she replied, “without doubt I have condemned myself. I am wrong. I should have no judgment in matters too high for the reach of our poor thoughts. And yet how can one, who feels the darkness within, cease to conjecture and hope, and look forward for that which the heart, as God hath made it, pants for, as the spent hart for the water-brooks? But surely our wisdom is, as our office, to wait for the signs in patience of the soul, which shall give us assurance of the Prophet of God whenever he shall appear. To you, Saturninus, these opinions I suppose are strange and new.” “Not so,” replied the Centurion; “I have been long in Judea, and the faith and the hopes of her people are already familiar to my ear, and my mind. I have heard much of that of which you have now spoken, and ever listen with satisfaction to any who converse of such things, as thereby I become more exact in my knowledge of the forms of religious faith, which prevail among your people; and it has ever been the thoughts of men concerning their religious observances and doctrines, that have possessed for me the highest power of attraction. As I enter the precincts of the dwelling of a new people, it is the first investigation with me, what is their belief of the gods? or have they none? or do they worship the forms of nature, and the instruments of her power? Among you of Judea have I alone found thoughts of God, worthy of the mind to entertain concerning that being, whom no mind can ever understand. I mean among the common people, and the whole people; for among us, philosophers have long held and do now hold opinions on such things, hardly less worthy to be reverenced than such as are to be found in your sacred books. But with you, adequate thoughts and conceptions of the Divinity are a universal inheritance.” “So,” said Judith, “they may seem to you, when you place them by the side of opinions held by the Roman populace. But so they seem not to me, and to many of our tribe who wait for the coming of the Just One. Our doctors and priests by their traditions, by which they have changed the law delivered by Moses, and in its place thrust their own figments, under which they escape from the obligations of a true piety, and in its stead offer to God and man the dead sacrifice of a ceremonial exactness, have corrupted not only our religion but the very hearts of the people, and with truth doubtless it may be affirmed, that beneath the fair and painted show we make of faith and love, their is hid unbelief, hatred, malice, and all uncleanness. The visible and apparent goodness is as a treacherous covering of verdure and flowers over dead men's graves, through which he who treads thereon falls into depths of foul corruption, that the mind dares not contemplate. Of your Roman people there must be more hope than of us, we having perverted and thrust from us a higher truth. I wait with hope to hear good things yet of John. As yet all that we learn is as nothing. We hear to-day by such as have come from farther up the river, that he declares himself to be but the herald of one greater than himself, but who that greater is, or who himself is, only darkly hints.” “So,” said I, “Ziba hath reported to me, receiving it from those who deal in news at Beth-Harem. The people, he says, are greatly moved with curiosity, many having gone up toward Galilee in the desire to see him. They were not a little enraged that the rulers gave not to his disciple, the Tanner of Enon, the liberty to declare himself. But in private dwellings they have heard him, and even on the steps of the market-place. They intend that on the next Sabbath his voice shall be heard in the Synagogue, if any power of theirs can bring it to pass.” “The heart of our people properly so called, Saturninus,” said Judith, “is better than that of their guides and masters, our proud counsellors and doctors. Among our sequestered valleys, away from corrupt cities, they are still in some sort a pure and simple tribe — believers in the spirit of our law as well as formal observers of the letter. Were a prophet indeed to arise, it is from them I should look for a just judgment concerning him, rather than from their masters, the Pharisees and doctors.” The moon now sinking below the horizon, and the inhabitants of the house having withdrawn from their amusement, the Centurion bid us farewell and turned toward the gates of Beth-Harem. It is not difficult to see, my mother, with what attractive power Judith acts upon Saturninus. He can neither hear other persons nor see other objects, while she is near; nor is it wonderful, for it is the same with all who approach her. But it would, methinks, amuse the dark Pilate, were it made known to him, that he whom he sent into these regions to observe and control an enemy, is already, as it were, become the friend and associate of his household. He may indeed know this, and suppose that his spy has but so much the nearer access for his observations. And it would be so, were Saturninus capable of playing two parts. But of that no one who had ever looked upon his countenance, in which are written, in characters that cannot deceive, honesty and truth, could believe him guilty. He comes to the dwelling of thy brother as a friend, and will do none other than the offices and acts of a friend. And truly in this manner does he gain most successfully the ends of his sojourn in Beth-Harem. For no one could so secure the adherence and quiet of Beth-Harem and its suburbs, as by showing himself the friend and companion of Onias. But as friendly as he is toward Onias, so is he to the inhabitants of the city, and especially to the more religious among them.

      <field name="fulltext">X. The beauty of this region, my mother, which lies on the shores of the Jordan, would delight your eye which so loves to dwell on the works of nature. If Tivoli and the Alban hills, the base of Soracte, the sea views of Baiæ and Naples, draw you so often from the heated walls of Rome, and send you back again so much happier and better, as you do ever affirm, not less would this Jewish world minister to both mind and body, to the eye loving beauty alone, and to the soul, seeking God in beauty as in all things. Indeed to thy spirit, which ever seems half caught away from earth by its familiar musings upon the future and unseen, this land would supply a nourishment others never can. Even I have come to perceive and feel the difference. It is like no other spot of earth. The mind thinks of the many times through so many centuries that the spirit of the Universe, the infinite and incomprehensible energy on which all depend, while from other nations he hath hidden himself in a silence and darkness never violated, hath here made himself visible, hath here conversed with man, and taught and guided him as a child, that through one people so instructed truth might be then spread abroad in the world — and thinking thus, a dread falls upon it in the midst of the scenes, where such things have been, which, though it awes the soul, yet strangely adds to the pleasure with which it gazes and contemplates. The very leaves of the trees as they tremble on their branches seem shaken by the invisible God; the dark woods and the silent grotto are here entered with a hesitating step, as if there especially would be felt his presence. On the banks of the sacred Jordan the ear hears Him in the murmuring of its waters. And over the face of the whole land, and in the overhanging air there seems brooding the spirit of Him, who hath indeed made all, and is the Father of all, but is in a nearer sense, as the past hath proved, the Father and Protector of this people, and may at any moment and in any place again make himself suddenly to be seen, and heard, and felt. Now especially are all looking and waiting for the place and the hour, when He shall shine forth and put in some soul his mind and his power, and establish his kingdom as of old in the sight of all men. Every rumor of what is strange is caught up and magnified, VOL. I. 23 and wherever it goes finds those full of feverish expectations, who are prompt to believe. Is this feeling that holds all alike, the high and the low, the slave and the lord, the Pharisee, the Sadducee, and the Herodian, the mother and the child, the sound and diseased of mind, the whole and the possessed, the Samaritan as well as the Jew, — is this a delusion? or is it indeed stirred up within us by the visitings of God himself, as a preparation for that which is to be soon unfolded? Oh, my mother, who can doubt, that hath dwelt upon the writings of our Scriptures, as I have lately done, whether it be of a divine origin, this general moving and heaving of the common mind? The time spoken of by the prophets hath come, and as they are true, must the kingdom of God quickly appear. And of a surety if ever this people is to be saved, it must be now; if ever they are to be snatched from the jaws of the devourer, it must be now ere they are quite swallowed up. A little while and they will be dissolved and lost in the mighty mass of the Leviathan, whose teeth are now gnashing upon them ready to destroy. Concerning this I have now at length somewhat of moment to say unto thee. But let it come in its order. It was on the first day of the week, the day following that on which Saturninus supped with Onias, that as I sat reading, not as in Rome, Ennius or Virgil or Seneca, but the Prophets, Judith with steps light as a falling leaf, drew near, and wished to converse. For Judith I was ready, alas! how ready, to close even the Prophets. I saw at once that some trouble had come into her clear spirit to stir and cloud its depths. “What is it?” said I, as she placed herself at my side; “your eye is often sad, but never troubled as now. Of what wouldst thou speak?” “Of my father, Julian — of Onias.” “And what of Onias?” said I with alarm; “is it not well with him?” “Yes, it is well with him,” she replied, “and yet is he sick. He is not as he used to be. He is silent; he hears not what is spoken; by night he wakes, and dreams by day. Then, as thou knowest, he leaves the harvest, and the care of his fields, where once was all his delight, for the company of those in Beth-Harem, whom formerly he knew not, for those long visits to Machærus, and journeys to and fro over Judea. I know not what it all portends.” “Confides he not in thee, Judith?” “Alas! not in all things. My mother, as I have heard, shared not only his love but his trust also. Me, though he loves as fondly as father, methinks, ever did, yet doth he still deem a child to be loved indeed, but not wholly trusted.” “But to me, Judith, will he entrust less of himself than to thee. I am a stranger in comparison of thee. He has spoken to me only of things common to all. On our journey hither, indeed, he talked more largely, but since, he has been closer to me than even to thee.” “Yet,” said Judith, “do I guess from the looks which from time to time he fixes on you, that to you he will ere long impart that, whatever it may be, which causes his anxiety. But I would that before that, nay at once, you might tear his secret from him, and so either deliver him from his yoke, or, if it be worthy, share it with him, laying on me also an equal weight.” “Do you not,” said I, “even so much as surmise what it is that hath so possessed him?” “I cannot, Julian, but think I do; yet may God grant it to be an error. I know nothing; but, as thou sayest, I surmise. I fear then, that Onias plans a rising in Israel. Since my memory can tell of anything, it tells of nothing with such clearness and strength as of Onias's worship of the names and deeds of the Maccabees, and of Judas of Galilee. In the morning and the evening prayer these are the names, even with that of the Great God, first fixed in my mind. The petition, that God would grant salvation to his people in these times by some arm like theirs, to which he would give his own strength, has been with him the first and the last, the alpha and omega, of his prayers. And when the oppressions of Judea have been named, he has been ever wont to pour forth, with even a prophet's force, the wrath that has burned within him, so that our quiet vales have echoed far and near to the tones of his voice — when so roused the voice of a tempest.” “I shall never forget it,” said I. “In the streets of Cæsarea it towered over all the crash of the falling temple, the noise of the battle, and the braying of the trumpets.” “What I would say,” continued Judith, “is, that of late all this hath ceased. While his heart seems to burn hot within him, and the eye, starting and suspicious, shows that all is awake there — he speaks not of his old themes, and when of anything, of my veil perhaps, my sandal, or some idle household care. Then messengers arrive and depart in the silence of the night, and Onias ofttimes himself joins them — while upon me, though not indeed by words but otherwise more strictly, is enjoined silence and secrecy.” “I cannot, my cousin, like you, compare 23* Onias with himself at different times, nor note the signs which to-day make him to be unlike what he has been before. But neither can I doubt the truth of your conjectures. But, Judith, there is not within the compass of the hills and valleys of Judea, from the mountains of Lebanon to those of Idumea, a man for wisdom and power like Onias. If he be indeed laying, as he thinks, the foundation of a new Israel, he is a workman of whom we need not be ashamed, and who will put the top stone over where he has laid the foundation for it. What he begins he will end.” Judith drew back, with pain and distress in her countenance, as I said these words. “Oh Julian, and do you then think that such is to be the salvation of Israel? That the Saviour of our country is to be one whose garments shall be rolled in blood, his footsteps marked by the slaughter of embattled hosts, the devastation of cities and villages, and whose aim shall only be conquest and dominion? It may be so. So our people will think it to be. But for me, my heart, blindly perhaps, cries out against it. Though Onias should grow to be king of all Israel with Rome at his feet — 't would bring no joy to me. At Cæsarea, surely, if I have heard you aright, you withstood the madness of Philip and Anna.” “I did, indeed,” I answered; “but I might not therefore, dear Judith, the enterprise of Onias. Philip was one — Onias is another. A rising in Israel, that was but the rising of an Israelite, as in Cæsarea, I would now, as then, oppose as useless waste of life and strength, — though not as of itself to be held guilty. The slave may always turn on his enslaver, and plead God and the right. But when Israel — Israel through all her tribes — is roused, and rises in her ancient might, then, Judith, I shall be of her side, and my life, little as it may be, and with it all my wealth, shall be cast a bubble on the tide of war to bide the issue. And certain as we may find it to be, that Onias is laying the plans which you surmise, so certain is it that that is on foot, to which it will behove every son of Abraham to lend his heart and hand — from which none but a traitor to his country can turn away. It will be no affair of Cæsarea or Beth-Harem, but of Israel in all her borders.” Judith was silent. I saw that her disappointment was great at finding in me so prompt a defender of the cause, which she believed her father was engaged in originating or promoting. She could not conceal her grief. “But if,” she again resumed, “the purposes of Onias, and the enterprise he hath taken in hand be, as in the case of Cæsarea, one narrow and confined” — “Then,” I rejoined, “may you depend upon Julian taking the same part now as before.” “Let me hope,” she said, “that it will be so.” Saying these things, she returned with a step less light and quick to her apartments. Many things have served to convince me, that Judith's conjectures are not without some good foundation. I too have noted in the manner of Onias, when present, and the manner of his absence, that which hath put me upon considering the probable causes of what appeared to me a conduct too unusual and singular to be the effect of mere accident, or a momentary humor. But what I had reached only through much reasoning, and bringing into one connexion things apparently diverse and remote, and was then after all an obscure and doubtful conclusion, was soon made certain and clear, and placed beyond question by the communication of Onias himself. By no means was I prepared for all that he unfolded, when, soon after Judith had left me, as I was walking slowly toward Beth-Harem by the early twilight, he overtook me and began to converse. When we had talked for a space of such things as first offered themselves, and had advanced a little on the road, we came to a well which lies half way between the house of Onias and the gate of the city, whither the inhabitants often resort, that they may refresh themselves on the spot with its cooler waters, and bear them in pitchers and skins to their houses. Trees on every side shield it from the rays of the sun, save where the highway passes it in a straight course to the city, whose gates, seen at a distance, seem to be a wall to prevent the further passage of the traveller. All around among the trees, are seats rudely constructed of rocks, nearly in the shape in which nature left them, but which, covered with moss or leaves that have grown up and spread over them, afford an agreeable resting place to the weary pilgrim as he arrives thus far on his journey, or to those who seek them for the cool air, or water, and as a relief from the noise and dust of Beth-Harem. Here Onias led me; and here we sat by the well side about the tenth hour. He seemed like one who wishes yet fears to speak; and while he fears and doubts, first discourses of many things about which he cares not. “It was not far from here,” he said, “that we first saw the Roman Saturninus, as he advanced towards Beth-Harem.” “It was but a few paces distant,” I said. “Saturninus,” he resumed musingly, “is a good man. He is a Roman, a sinner of the gentiles, but he is a good man. Moreover, he loves our nation, and already hath conferred many favors on our Synagogue.” “He seems to me,” I replied, “to be one, to whom it is natural to do well; and for whom it matters little, whether he believes in the gods of Rome, or the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He hath that ready for which alone we need a knowledge of the truth, virtue; and it is enough.” “For this world,” said Onias. “But how shall he have a part in the resurrection, except he be a son of Abraham? The promises of Jehovah are to no others. Nevertheless, he is a good man; and it were a pity evil befell him in this world, or the world to come.” “As for the world to come,” said I, “I am willing to leave him to the compassions of God, which are more than man's. In Zadok's hands he would fare ill — nor would I readily trust him to Eleazer. It is well for man, that in the judgment day, a being of larger mercy than his holds the balance in which sin is weighed.” “May I be delivered from the judgment of man,” said Onias, “for his mercies are cruel; nor would I that Saturninus suffer therefrom.” “Why should he fear, or shouldst thou fear for him?” I asked. “Julian,” said thy brother, “he and his men are as those who once stood upon the plain by the Salt Sea. The earth is on fire beneath them, and is ready to part asunder and swallow them up. At a moment when they look not for it, yea when they are in security, at the feast it may be, or the dance, sudden destruction may overtake them.” Hardly doubting what the thought was in thy brother's mind, I yet asked him of what he spake, and whence the danger to Saturninus. As he was about to reply, the form of one walking toward the city drew nigh, and pausing at the well, then approached us where we sat, and surveying us a moment, gave the salute of peace to Onias. The obscurity of the air did not allow us to discern who it was, especially as he was much wrapped about in his garment, for the evening was cool; but no sooner had he spoken, than we knew the voice of Zadok. I was vexed that we were so interrupted, but Onias seemed, on the other hand, glad that the Ruler was come, and acceded readily to his request that we would pass the gates and enter his dwelling, which was just within them. We accordingly rose from our seat, and accompanied him to the city. We were soon once more at our ease beneath the roof of the Rabbi, who gave us hospitable entertainment. Onias soon returned to what we had been conversing of. “You ask,” said he, “of what danger I spake? — Zadok, Julian, is of our side.” “Aye,” said the Rabbi,” that am I. Say on. Fear me not.” “Of part at least of what I would say,” continued Onias, “I doubt not, Julian, thou more than surmisest — that there is to be a rising in Israel!” I said, that so much I could not but gather from what he had said at different times, and from what I had observed. “Yes,” said Onias, “the hour has come, when once more Judea shall own her king! The time for her redemption hath drawn nigh! — and but that in Cæsarea, the tumult that happened there threw a hindrance in our way, the hour ere this had fully come. A secret league, invisible to all eyes save those whom it concerns, binds together all parts of our land to our enterprise. In Galilee, in Samaria, in Peræa, in Judea, in Idumea, are there those who stand ready and waiting, their hands upon their swords and their loins girded — a multitude that no man can number. Who is he, in whose veins runs the blood of a true Israelite, that will refuse to join himself to such a company — to those who, though they should themselves perish, shall purchase redemption for Israel; shall be the sacrifice with which the Lord shall be well pleased; shall lay the first stones of the foundations of that kingdom of our God that shall be everlasting. It is not thou, Julian, of the house of Alexander, who will draw back! Since I saw thee in the fight in Cæsarea, I knew thee to be an Israelite indeed, and what I have heard since from thee hath persuaded me, that on thee one may rely as a staff that shall not bend nor break.” I then was about to say what I had but just before declared to Judith, concerning the extent in which the whole people were engaged in the present enterprise; but Onias interrupted me, — “I know what thou wouldst say. Fear not. This is not, Julian, a revolt on the part of Onias, the vine-dresser, nor on the part of Beth-Harem and the country round about, nor on the part of the inhabitants of Peræa alone. It is not one against a thousand, nor a thousand against the innumerable hosts of Rome. But it is, or it shall be Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, who shall rise as one man against the oppressor! If with their handful among the rocks and the hills, Matathias and Judas overcame the great Antiochus, and wrought out deliverance for Israel, how shall it be but that when the same VOL. I. 24 Israel comes up, with all her hosts mustered and arrayed, and the Lord and his anointed to lead them on, we shall again triumph, and more than triumph, over the uncircumcised, and upon the necks of those who have been our rulers, set our feet as kings and conquerors? Julian,” continued thy brother, with a voice low and mysterious, “to the ears of one who is worthy to hear so glad tidings I say it, We have found the Messiah!” — “Aye,” said Zadok, “we have found the Messiah!” “And it is he,” continued Onias, “who shall lead the hosts of Israel.” “Yea,” said Zadok, “it is under our king we shall fight.” “What mean you?” I asked; “what, and whom mean you? — this prophet on the banks of the Jordan?” “A man possessed of a Devil?” cried Zadok. “What mark,” said Onias, “do we behold in John, of him who is to redeem Israel? What is he but a wandering beggar, if indeed he be not, as Zadok saith, in the possession of a Devil? So in truth affirm, — and who should discern in such things clearer than they, — so affirm Pharez the Diviner, and Uzzi the Exorcist. Is he such an one as the people are looking for, and such an one as the Prophets have foretold? In Herod! Julian, in the Tetrarch of Galilee, do we behold our future king.” Neither was I wholly unprepared for this disclosure. Onias had more than once hinted his belief, and his frequent intercourse with Herod at Machærus had confirmed my suspicions. But though, for myself, I was ready to give due honor to Herod as a king, I was not ready to own him as the great and expected Prince. And so, at once, I said to Onias. He heard me, and replied, “Be not in haste to reject him ere you have known and seen him. As there were not wanting those who in former days believed the Great Herod to be the Sent of God, so there are not wanting a greater number who for better reasons put their faith in his Son. If it be the office of the Anointed of God to be the Saviour of his country, to drive from her borders the Gentile, to raise Jerusalem from where she sits in sackloth and ashes to her ancient pinnacle of renown, to exalt the law in the eyes of all nations and establish it, and bring under its dominion all the nations of the Earth, and if now, as all our wise men affirm, and the Scriptures declare, the set time is come, and the times of the prophecies are fulfilled, where shall we look but to Herod? where are the signs for which we seek but in him? He is already a prince powerful and wise; his brother of Iturea is also a prince, of power hardly less, and in Jerusalem dwells Philip, who holds no small sway over the hearts of the people of that great capital. Moreover, an inward voice persuadeth Herod that he is the man, and they, who are wise in a knowledge of things hidden to common eyes, announce him such — diviners and soothsayers, they are of one and the same mind.” “Yea,” said Zadok, “it is so. Pharez and Uzzi both hail him king.” “If Herod be not He, where shall we find him?” continued Onias — “it, is now, or it is never. The Prophets say now — yet I say again, where is he? Who will show him to us? If Herod be not he, we may again lie down in despair, for there is no other. Over the whole face of Judea the eye beholds no other; and the days are fulfilled.” “And who,” I asked, “believe in him?” “There are those scattered throughout all the borders of the land,” he replied, “who are believers, and who stand with their hands on their swords, prompt to act when he shall declare himself. The Herodians, save a few, are with him. No words are spoken; but the seeds of revolt are sown in all parts, and are taking root. And what think you when I say, that a league is made with Sejanus, whereby at the time that he in Rome strikes for the Empire, Herod strikes for Judea, and while the Tetrarch subdues the common enemy here and Sejanus there, as Sejanus will be Emperor of Rome — yet but for a season — Herod will reign King of the Jews.” “Is it indeed so?” I asked; for this I own amazed me. “It is so,” replied Onias; “and the proof thereof thou shalt behold at Machærus with thine own eyes. Herod has not been idle these many years, though others have slept. We have forgotten even ourselves; but he hath remembered us. The secret chambers of Machærus shine with the arms and the harness of thousands, which he hath caused to be furnished and laid away in their dark repository. So is it in Beth-Harem, at Herodium, but chiefly at Tiberias and Sepphoris, in whose vaults are piled spear, and sword, and shield, javelin, and polished armor, for as many as for the love of Judea shall be ready to use them.” “Let my eyes have knowledge of this,” I cried — “though I doubt not thy word Onias — and —” “Thine eyes shall see it all,” cried Zadok, “and when they have seen, thou wilt say, the half was not told thee.” 24* Onias paced impatiently the room where we sat, as if he would break through its walls for a larger space. “Yea,” he exclaimed, lifting up his eyes to Heaven and spreading forth his arms, “yea, the time, the set time is come, and He will comfort Zion. He will build up her waste places. Put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the Holy City. Thou shalt no more be called Desolate, but thou shalt be called Hepzi-bah and thy land Beulah, for the Lord delighteth in thee. Mine eyes, even mine, shall behold thine honor, and shall see thine enemies, the uncircumcised and the accursed, broken, and scattered, and destroyed, as the chaff before the whirlwind, as the stubble beneath the flail of the thresher, as the fine dust beneath the hoofs of the horses and the wheel of the chariot! Yea, let mine eye see its desire upon mine enemies, and upon thine, O Jerusalem, daughter of God, and then, having seen thy salvation, shall I lie down and sleep in peace.” Zadok then took up the word, and in strains yet more triumphant, sang the redemption of Israel and the glorious kingdom of Messiah. If I shared their zeal in some degree, my mother, thou wilt not marvel, seeing it is now so long a time that I have laid aside the Roman and stood forth a veritable Hebrew. Yet can I not agree with Onias in all that he holds of Herod. It may be that by him as an instrument, and a forerunner of our Messiah, a way is to be cleared, obstructions to be removed, the enemy driven out, the land restored to its rightful possessors and governors, and that then the reign of the mysterious Prince, whom all look for, but none seemeth to comprehend, shall commence, and its fruits bless the earth. So much is certain, that of all who live of our faith and name, Antipas is he who possesseth more than any other the power to do Israel a service, which needs first to be done, — raise her out of the dust and deliver her from her oppressors. Till there be victory over her enemies, there can be no peaceful years when the people, sitting under their own vine and fig tree, shall be free to listen to the voice of the prophets whom God shall send, or of eye so single as to acknowledge and rejoice in Messiah, though God should send him forth. Herod, with the people well disposed toward him, and aided by Philip, may do for Israel what Judas did and Matathias, and so doing, will do a work for which the ages to come shall celebrate his name even as of that Elias who is first to come. I did not refuse ere we took our departure from the dwelling of Zadok, nor did I wish to refuse, to assure Onias that heartily would I work with him in his enterprise for the redemption of our common country. But first I required a more certain knowledge of what the Tetrarch had truly purposed, and of what he was truly capable to accomplish, and whether to the extent supposed, the people of Israel would lend themselves to his undertaking. It was therefore agreed, that I should see Herod, and from communication with himself derive the satisfaction, which one can only derive by conversing with the principal of any affair that is to be prosecuted. To Zadok it seemed a thing already established, that the new kingdom was begun, and himself already one among the chief officers of the king's court. He could speak only of the riches which should flow in from conquered nations and tributary provinces; of the places of trust that should be bestowed upon such as, like himself, were early in their zeal, and were known to him who should first fill the throne. His ambition hardly knew any bounds in these imaginary honors. Jerusalem — nothing less — would thenceforward be the place of his abode. Onias, though he seasonably rebuked such excess of expectation, yet in another manner failed not to utter the hopes he could not but entertain of the happy changes that should take place in Judea, when Jerusalem and not Rome should be the centre, whence should flow honors and trusts; and which should then be bestowed not as now upon the stranger, and the gentile, but upon the true sons of the Patriarchs; and when each tribe, in its ancient dominion and limits, should enjoy its own prince on his own seat of judgment judging over it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XI. It has seemed a strange thing to me, my mother, when I have thought since of my conversation with Onias, and Zadok, and of the disclosures then made concerning Sejanus, and the league which was about to be secretly formed with him, that I, who am still in some sort a Roman, should be privy to such a contract, made or about to be made, whose end and object is a revolution in Rome, not less than Judea. A little while ago, and I should have thought that he designed evil against me, who had held me capable, and reported me so, of any alliance with a spirit so base as that of Sejanus, or of joining myself to an undertaking that aimed at any alteration, or overthrow, of the powers in Rome. But I now know one thing which once I did not, that 't is not we who shape our course in life, but Providence that marks it for us; that 't is not good alone that works out good in the plans of God, but evil also, and that so evil is itself, in part, good. Thus as in the earth foul things, and things not so much as to be named, contribute toward the production of other things the most beautiful and necessary, and even poisonous things to the production of those that are nutritious or medicinal, so wicked men are not wholly hurtful or useless, but seeing that they must exist because human nature is such as it is, they are made to work out ends of righteousness through the providence of God, where they had no good intention or purpose themselves, but rather the contrary. Wherefore it may happen, and so I think it will, that though Sejanus be in himself unworthy, he may through that which he shall confer upon Herod in return for acts, or promises on his part, greatly help the people of God, and their deliverance from a galling bondage. And, surely, little evil would be inflicted upon any, though the monarch of Capreæ should be thrown from the rocks whence he casts those whom he desires to torment or destroy, and were buried in the depths of the sea. Sejanus for Tiberius might indeed be no gain to Rome; but it would be no loss. As it is not possible to conceive a worse being than he whom we place in the sovereignty of Hell, so cannot the imagination form an image of a human creature, more wicked or vile than Tiberius, and whether it is he or his parasite who shall rule in Rome can matter little to its inhabitants. Since the evening passed in the dwelling of Zadok, and the conversation held there with the Rabbi and Onias, thy brother has returned to his usual manner and appears, as Judith asserts, even as was his wont, ere he had entered into the schemes which have taken him away from his home, and filled him with anxieties and cares. There is to be seen in him the common effect of relieving one's self of a secret within his own household. To those whom he chiefly esteems, Onias now feels free to speak of the things which engage, or which trouble him, and by dividing thus the burden, it is more easily borne. Judith, to her exceeding joy, now shares his confidence, although she will not approve, as she doubts the wisdom of the plans he is pursuing. Of Herod she holds an opinion, which no persuasion or reason whatever can force her to alter, and which allows her not for one moment to look upon him as he is seen by Onias. Upon what foundation her judgment rests, I as yet know not, nor whether it be such as to warrant the strength with which she holds it; but this is certain, that whatever judgment she forms is worthy to be well weighed, for she is both deliberate in forming her opinions, and honest and true as Astræa herself. The reports which reach us of John, now called the Baptist, are of his gathering still more and more about him, and in a land already divided by sects of all kinds, of his forming yet another. By what he is to distinguish himself and his followers I know not, unless it be by the severity of his doctrine and manner of life. This, indeed, is constantly affirmed, that he announces the approach of a prophet greater than himself, whose servant even, he is not meet to be; but who that prophet is he declares not, whether Elijah, or he who shall precede Messiah, or Messiah himself. He has already drawn upon him the hatred of the Pharisees, for he spares not their vices in his harangues to the people; but he secures the regard of the populace, who ever love to hear their rulers involved in at least the same condemnation in which they are themselves included. Against Herod, however, as well as against the Rulers, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees, has he lifted up his voice, whose enmity as it will be easily excited, so he will find it more difficult to escape from or appease. Nay, as for that, there are none in the land, Greek, Roman, or Jew, Pharisee or Essene, Herodian or Sadducee, high or low, from the Chief Priests and the council at Jerusalem, to the Ruler of a Synagogue, whose enmity he will not rouse against both himself and his followers, VOL. I. 25 if the same kind of speech continues to mark his preaching. On the coming Sabbath, in the chief Synagogue of Beth-Harem I shall trust to hear what his follower, the Tanner of Enon, who still lingers here, will have to say. The Sabbath has come and passed, my mother, and I sit down to relate to you such of its incidents as may give you any satisfaction. The household of Onias frequent chiefly a synagogue on the banks of the Jordan, not more remote in one direction, than is Beth-Harem in another. Often, however, they resort to that within the walls, of which Shammai and Zadok are rulers. Thither was I desirous to go for many reasons, but chiefly that I might learn somewhat more distinctly concerning John from his follower, if, perchance, he should be permitted to declare himself. The cool and balmy air of the morning invited me early abroad, that I might enjoy for a time the solitude which on this day I crave, and of late have been accustomed to, and might be among the first who should reach the synagogue. As I emerged from the shaded grounds of Onias upon the highway leading to the city, I found it already sprinkled with companies of those who, like myself, were going up to worship. The scene was beautiful to the eye, presented by the forms of young and old in every variety of gay clothing, moving along beneath the dark shadows of the trees, which here border and overhang the path. At the well, many stopped to quench their thirst with its cool waters, and others reposed a while on the rocks, or lay along upon the cool herbage. But this indulgence lasted not long, but was broken by the shrill echoes of the trumpets of the synagogue sounding the hour of the service. As we approached and passed the gates of the city, and entered the streets, the thinly scattered groups of the highway thickened gradually into a numerous throng, pressing forward in one direction. The noise of those, who conversed with animation and energy, was heard on every side. Of some who were near me, I could not, without an effort, which I was not disposed to make, help but hear what were the topics of their discourse. One was loud in his complaints of Shammai. “He preaches not himself,” he said, “and those who would preach he hinders. Verily he chiefly loveth the wine cup, and for companions, not those who go up to the house of the Lord, but such as tarry long at the feast.” “Nay,” rejoined his companion, “but he is a good man; he talks not so loud as others, and prays not so loud nor so long, but when he turns his back upon the synagogue, he doth not turn it on his prayers also, as is the custom with many.” “Ah, neighbor, thou ever findest an apology for Shammai. But he is just one of those who trust to what their mothers made them. There is not a precept of the law, nor a custom handed down, but he violateth it, as it shall be convenient. Lest he should be righteous overmuch is his fear; surely one without ground. The curse of the Lord will rest upon such. Zadok, truly, savoreth of the former days. He is one whom the Lord delighteth to honor.” “Verily,” said the other, “if the heart is to be judged by the breadth of one's phylacteries, by washings, and fastings, and prayers, then is Zadok a son of God, and there is none like him, for he holdeth himself not washed, if he have not removed his ring, though it be slight as a girdle of hair, and on the Sabbath treadeth not on the dried grain, lest he unwittingly do the work of the thresher. Then, when the first day of the week dawneth, let him who standeth in his debt beware the gripe of Zadok. It is as that of death and the grave. No man can deliver.” “I never heard,” replied the first, “that he claimed more than his own. Surely one hath a right to his own. The law is the law.” “I know not that,” responded the other, “if it be that the law is without mercy. The heart was made before the law. The beasts, and even gentiles, feel pity.” “Justice before mercy,” cried his companion, and they were lost to my hearing. Others, as they walked slowly along, conversed of the hopes of Judea. “It were truly a joy,” said an old man, yet moving firm and upright by the help of his staff, from the head of which glittered jewels of no little value, “if one's days might be prolonged to behold it.” “Who can doubt,” said a younger companion upon whom he leaned, “who can doubt, that even your eyes shall see it. Many scoff, I know, and say that we hope in vain, and that we are better now than we could be under any change. But they are worthy not so much as of a word of rebuke. The people judge otherwise; and who can help believe, that it is God who moves in the heart of a whole people. If it be so, his kingdom is not far off.” “The Lord grant it be so,” replied the other. “I may not live to behold that day of glory, but, my son, what with thy virtue and the wealth I leave thee, the fruit of long days of toil, what seat of dignity can there be to which thou mayst not hope to rise?” 25 * “Say not so, my father; thy frame is firm yet, if aged, and it is age and its gathered stores of wisdom that in the new reign will stand in the highest honor.” “All my wisdom,” said the other, “is folly. I have added gold to gold, and silver to silver, and how that is to be done I know well. But of the gentle studies that inform the mind with truth, and make it wise and humble, alas, I am ignorant. What do I love this day but dignity and power, and what but these can my full coffers purchase? But these, my son, they can purchase, and they are something; aye, they are somewhat real, things which the eye can see, and the hands handle, and which will gain the worship of the people. What is wisdom after all? I have secured the best.” “'T is said, father, that to-day we may know somewhat more of John.” “Why wilt thou speak of him again, my son,” cried the other with sudden passion, “a madman and a fool. May Shimei's curses light upon him.” And so, with louder voice and uplifted staff, he was separated from me. As they were borne away, a voice addressed me from another quarter; “Can you tell me, friend, what this news is from Idumea?” “I have heard nothing,” I said; “you, therefore, can inform me, at least of more than I know now.” “What is reported, is this, that a prophet has appeared there also, about whom the people gather in multitudes and follow after him.” “I think it cannot be a rumor having any foundation; Onias hath of late received letters from that region which speak not of it.” “Nevertheless,” said he, “it is boldly affirmed, and by those who come from Jerusalem.” “Jerusalem is full of reports and rumors,” I replied, “and nothing is to be trusted coming thence.” “That may be,” he answered, “and yet it may be true. Among so many lies as now abound, a truth must chance presently, that is my hope. Peace be with you,” — and he passed on. As I now turned into the street, which led directly to the front of the synagogue, up the steps of which the people were hastening, a beggar seated on the ground, both blind and a cripple, saluted me, asking alms. “For the love of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets have pity upon me and give me an alms. How can I labor, having neither sight nor power of motion? The Lord grant thee prosperity as thou rememberest the poor.” “How do I know,” said I, “that thine eyes are blind, being hidden by that bandage; and how do I know that thy feet are lame, doubled up beneath that pile of rags?” “Ah! wretched man that thou art,” cried the cripple, “to deride whom God hath visited with his judgments! Blind Levi never spake false. At the house over against the fish market, at the sign of the Chief Priest, thou mayst inquire concerning me. But stay, and behold now.” Saying which, ere I could prevent his action, he tore the bandage from his head, revealing a hideous spectacle of the hollow spaces whence the eyes had been eaten away by disease, and threw aside from his limbs the rags that covered them, showing both his feet to have been destroyed by the same awful distemper. “Behold,” he cried, “what the leprosy hath taken, and what, blessed be God! it hath left.” “Dost thou still bless God,” I asked, “when he hath made thee thus?” “Yea, truly,” said he. “Should I curse him, because the warm air blows over me, and the food of the charitable still nourisheth me, and the music of their kind words falls upon my ear? If I see not, I can speak; and if I cannot walk, I can sit, and creep. A penny, a penny for blind Levi.” “I have not even a halfpenny to give thee,” I answered; “but when the Sabbath is over, I will call and see thee.” As I thus replied, a loud and hoarse voice behind me cried out — “The Lord bless thee, Levi, even though thou breakest the Sabbath;” and at the same time he who spoke showered down a handful of small coin upon the stones, and swept on his way with flowing robes toward the synagogue. The coin, which I could not give myself, I was forced to aid the blind man to gather up, thinking as I did so, that there was virtue in the manner of a favor, as in the favor itself. Bidding the cripple then farewell, I turned toward the temple, and passing the outer court, where were many who chose rather to spend their time there in idle gossip, than penetrate farther, I entered. It was already filled with more than its usual number of worshippers, nay all parts of it were thronged with those who were drawn by a desire to hear what the Tanner from Enon might have to say, if, perchance, the Rulers should allow him to declare himself. The uppermost seats, being here as with us in the near neighborhood of the ark of the Law, were occupied by the rulers, the chief doctors of Beth-Harem, both Pharisees and Sadducees, and such others as chose to place themselves there; among whom I perceived Onias, and not far from him Saturninus. The services going before the preaching, are as in Rome. When, accordingly, the prayers were over, the chanting, and the reading of the Law and the Prophets, Shammai, who had discharged the last office, sat down, and the congregation waited for him who should speak to them. When there had been silence for some time, and no one had risen, Zadok stood up and said; — “This day, men of Israel, is the Scripture brought to pass, which saith, Behold I set before you blessing and cursing, a blessing on such as keep the commandments I have delivered unto them, and a curse on such as break them. But you will surely say, Which Scripture is fulfilled? Verily both. The blessing is upon the keepers of the law, and a curse upon the breakers of it. Truly is there a curse upon the despisers of the Law. The Law is God, and the despiser thereof despiseth God, and blasphemeth. Let him be cursed. Let him die the death of the unrighteous, and let his carcase, as that of Jezebel, be given to the dogs that they may devour it. Let his soul perish from among the people of God. The law — it is the Law that exalteth Israel upon the high Mountain, and maketh her a spectacle of honor to the whole earth. We are the people; yea verily, we are the people of God, and there is none other. The nations of the earth are accursed. There is reserved for them nothing other than the blackness of darkness forever. Hell shall devour them, nor shall her gates ever deliver them up. The law of the Lord that came by Moses is perfect, despise it not therefore, ye blasphemers! Yea, and moreover, it is everlasting; it is built upon a rock whose foundations are hidden in the fulness of God. He is its sure support; and in these times, verily in our own day, will he exalt it to more abundant honor. The anointed of the Lord shall appear, Shiloh shall come! the Son of David shall arise, and Jerusalem, the holy city, and all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, shall go forth and meet him at his coming, and crown him King! Redeemer of his people! their Saviour out of the hands of their enemies, the Repairer of breaches, whose kingdom shall be from everlasting to everlasting! Make yourselves ready, men of Israel, to greet your King. Let the great and the mighty rise up to meet him, for their greatness shall be increased an hundred fold. Let the rich man pour out of his riches, for they shall be multiplied as the sand of the sea shore. Let the warrior make bright his armor, and gird on his sword, for the enemies of the Lord, as of old, must be slain, ere the true children of the kingdom can enter into their inheritance. Let the lovers of ease, and sloth, let those who tremble at their own shadow, let the young maiden and the little children, the poor and humble flee into safe places and the hidden dens of the mountains, — it will be then no time for them — while the great and the mighty and the strong take possession, and scatter the enemy and build up the walls of the new kingdom of our God. It shall be an eye for an eye — yea and a tooth for a tooth, and more than that, ten thousand fold of evil for evil, upon the foes of Judah. For a little finger they have laid upon us, there shall be laid an arm upon them as thick as a man's loins. And what will ye say, if it be told unto you, that now, even now, he who shall come and restore all things is standing in the midst of you and ye know him not? All things are not revealed to all. But by dreams, and visions, and the inspirations of the Most High, are there those, wise men and as it were prophets, unto whom the truth hath been delivered. In due season all eyes shall behold it and all hearts confess it. When the day, and the hour, and the moment hath arrived, which Daniel the Prophet hath foretold, then shall the light arise, then the Kingdom of Heaven hath come nigh unto you, and its everlasting reign commenced. But that moment, who shall declare it? Ye men of Israel, be not deceived. Run not hither and thither after those, who, like some among us, would lead you astray pursuing false hopes. The Lord will bring them to confusion. When the great Messiah cometh, all eyes will behold his glory. He who runs may read the signs which shall announce him the Son of God, the King of Israel.” These are some of the things that Zadok said. When he had ceased, the faces of the congregation were turned to where the Tanner of Enon sat on one of the chief seats of the synagogue, as if desiring that he would say somewhat. But inasmuch as the Ruler did not invite him to teach, he held his peace. Shammai, whose office it was to ask those who were present to speak to the people, being desirous that if it were possible, there should be no disturbance, made a pretence, as if he saw not the wishes of the hearers in their eyes; and turning toward Onias, asked him, If he had anything to declare in the audience of the people, to say on. But thy brother refused, knowing well what the present temper of the multitude was, and that it was a vain thing to hope to withstand it. When, therefore, the people saw that Shammai understood them not, or made as though he did not, then they, many of them, with one accord cried out, saying, VOL. I. 26 “We would hear Simon, the Tanner of Enon. He hath somewhat to say, it concerneth Israel to hear.” Upon that, Shammai, not unwillingly in his own heart, for he careth too little for any one opinion to hinder the uttering of any other, turned toward Simon the Tanner, and giving him the book of the Prophets, bid him read, and then say on. Upon that, Zadok strove with zeal to lay silence on the Tanner, Eleazer and others aiding him, and saying many things of John, which, whether they were true or not, only inflamed so much the more the people to hear one of his followers, so that they filled the house with their cries that Simon should be permitted to speak; which, when the Rulers saw that it could not be prevented, they made no more resistance, but submitted to what was inevitable. So when Simon saw that no more opposition was made, and when silence had once more been obtained, he stood up and said; “Men and brethren of the house of Jacob, despise not one who is but the servant of servants, who would declare to you the things that concern the salvation of Israel. Pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Railing Rabshakahs have not prevailed, nor cursing Shimeis, to stop the mouth of him who bringeth good news, good news of the coming of the kingdom of God. Your ears are open to hear, and your hearts to confess the power of the Most High. Let the wicked, as now, gnash their teeth, but they shall come to nought. “The Lord God of Israel in the days of our fathers, when they had gone down into Egypt, having pity upon his own children, when he had punished them, delivered them by the hand of his servant Moses. And when in process of time having transgressed again, as being a stiff-necked and rebellious race they have ever done, Judah was carried away captive into Babylon. But when ye had suffered the just punishment for your iniquities, the Lord again had compassion, and your prosperity was restored, and Jerusalem and Judah were clad in their beautiful garments. In these latter days God hath promised to redeem us by a prophet, Like unto Moses. For our transgression and idolatries, for our revoltings and our blasphemies, have we these many years suffered his just rebuke. But the Sceptre hath at length departed from Judah, and the Lawgiver from between her feet, and the gentile hath possessed the land in all her borders. And now, therefore, the times being fulfilled, the eyes of all the world look for the appearing of him who shall save us. The time of our affliction being ended, as the prophets have foreshown, we now wait for the Redeemer. But, will he come before our chastisements have cleansed us? and our stripes have purged us? and our captivity and our bonds have humbled us? Ye men of Israel, it is your sins that make a separation between you and your God! Ye must prepare the way before him by repentance. Repent ye of your iniquities! if ye would behold the kingdom of God. Forsake the evil of your ways, your prayers that are an empty sound, your fastings that are a mockery, your worshippings and sacrifices that are but a vain show! Think no longer to deceive man and God by the false appearance. The Lord seeth the heart. The Lord despiseth the hypocrite. The Lord looketh through you, as the eye through the clear water. Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings altogether, and make a straight path, swept, and cleansed, and thoroughly purged, and the messenger of the covenant shall suddenly come, bringing salvation and healing on his wings. This is the message of John. He is the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the Desert a high way for our God! He is but as one that runneth before the king. He is as the star of the morning, whose coming proclaimeth the rising of the greater light, that enlighteneth the whole world. He is not that greater light. Ye, nevertheless, muse in your hearts, whether he be the Christ or not. Wise men, the Scribes and Pharisees, Priests and Levites of Jerusalem have come asking, Art thou the Christ? — tell us plainly. He hath denied not, but confessed, saying I am not the Christ. He saith only that he is one who cometh preaching, and saying, The kingdom of Heaven is at hand, even at the door; and exhorting men to repentance, that they may be found worthy to enter therein. His baptism is unto repentance. He who cometh to him, and is baptized with water and confesses his sins, belongeth to him, and is as a stone fitted and polished to be built into the temple and palace of our King. Come then, ye men of Judea, ye who look for the consolation of Israel in the fall of the modern Babylon, ye who would make ready for the Son of God, ye who are of the true children of Abraham, come to the Baptism of John, and be washed of your iniquities. Come while the invitation is held out, and the door is open, and the lamps are burning, for if ye refuse, there are those, not of the house of Abraham, whom God shall call, and who shall come in and sit down at the feast which shall be prepared, and dwell in the cities 26* that shall be built of every precious stone, shining as the sun at noon-day. Come and make ready for the Prince. He standeth in the midst of you, and ye know him not; but he will suddenly reveal himself, and his glory shall be apparent to every eye; and then will you, who harden your hearts and shut your cars, be covered with confusion, and your shame shall be published from one end of Heaven to the other.” When Simon had ended these words, and had sat down, all eyes were fastened upon him, as upon one who had spoken what at least he truly believed, and who desired the welfare of those whom he had reproved. The assembly would willingly have heard him farther. But he seemed not inclined to multiply words. There being silence for a brief space, as Simon ceased, Zadok seemed like one who would fain deliver himself of other matter, that appeared to be restrained with difficulty; nor would he have been withheld from giving vent to it, as I think, but that he feared lest the people, who so evidently were impressed by the words of the Tanner, would listen to what he might say with either impatience, or open signs of disapprobation. Those, however, who apprehended lest he might rise and utter himself with new violence, were relieved when they beheld Shammai stand up, who if sometimes through his Jewish nature he is violent, is for the most part calm and forbearing. “Ye Jews!” said he; “Servants of God, lovers of the Law, and children of Abraham, be not too much carried away by hopes which may end in disappointment. To judge of the truth of the claims of one who shall declare himself a prophet, or the Christ himself, ye must hold your minds clear from the false leadings of passion, and of any fixed opinion. Else will ye judge, not after the truth of things, but only after some image, or idol, in your own thoughts. When we feed our desires high, by much meditation upon them, then are the eyes of our mind already blinded, and though we should open them we should see nothing with clearness, nor as it is in itself. By looking outwards, we should only take another way of looking inwards. Wherefore dwell not too much on what is to be, or what may happen, or upon the purposes of God not yet revealed. For, so doing, ye will only raise up phantoms perhaps of error, from which ye will find it hard to escape. But rather wait, doing with zeal the duties which are uppermost, until that which is to come, is come, and taketh the shape which God shall give; then will your eyes and minds be purged, and without mote or film, error or idol, to judge a just judgment. We know, for so the Prophets have declared it, that Messiah shall in these days appear, and all Israel, as one man, awaiteth his rising. But we know not how he shall appear, in what form, nor with what circumstances of greatness and glory. Nor do we know in what part of our wide land he shall first display his power. Let us allay our heats, and believe that the God who gave us our Lawgiver, and brought us out of Egypt, and hath sustained us hitherto, will now so manifest himself, that, as soon as he appeareth, every heart and every tongue shall confess him and shout Hosannah! Simon hath spoken well; and concerning John hath said things that in themselves are credible, and in agreement with the Scriptures; and are not dishonorable to John, not though he were a Prophet indeed. But we will stay our judgment, men of Beth-Harem, until we shall behold him with our own eyes. We will not rest in the judgment of another. The truth we now possess serves us well; we will not throw it from us without good reasons. Again, I say, let us each honor the Law, observe the Sabbaths, keep the feasts, offer our sacrifices, do the work which falls to us every day, as those who are both men and Hebrews, and wait for what God shall bring to pass.” Shammai, when he had finished, and the poor had been remembered, dismissed the assembly, who departed with more quietness than they would have done but for the parting words of the Ruler. The quietness, however, lasted not long, as it cannot among this fierce and contentious people, broken into so many factions, each aiming at the injury or destruction of the other. For no sooner had the multitude within the synagogue joined itself to the multitude without, than conversation and dispute arose on all sides concerning what had been said by Zadok, Simon, and Shammai. Some blamed one, and some another; some applauded one, and some another. Among others, I saw the old man, whom I had overheard on the way to the synagogue, apparently with much passion, accusing the Ruler as he descended the steps of the building. “Is it,” said he, “from the Ruler of our Synagogue, that we are to hear fools and madmen, idle wanderers, and falsehearted deceivers held up to honor? Who but Simon, and wretches like him, believe in John.” “Good Sir,” replied Shammai, “I have held up no deceiver, or blasphemer to honor before the people. Had I held up John to honor, which I did not, it is not yet shown that he is mad, or false, or impious.” “Yet,” said the other, “every one of any consideration knows it.” “The people do not know it,” replied the Ruler. “They are on John's side.” “Who,” said the rich man, “are the people? and what do they know, and how should they judge? Have our rulers, the priests, the council, our rich or learned men believed in him? That is the only question worth asking. They of Jerusalem condemn him.” “To be condemned by them of Jerusalem, is often to be commended of the truth;” answered Shammai. “Thou art a disciple of John and the Devil, and so shall I report thee,” cried the other in a rage. Shammai laughed, while the other turned away trembling with anger, more even than with years. The people, who had heard what the Ruler had said, applauded him, and said “Shammai is the friend of truth; he is afraid neither of the rich, nor the powerful.” Zadok approaching, some one cried out. “Who is Zadok's Christ, standing in the midst of us? Is Zadok also a believer in John?” Another exclaimed, “It is a greater than John the Baptist, Zadok believes in.” “Or his disciple, Simon the Tanner,” shouted a third with a deriding tone. “Blessed the people,” cried yet another voice from the crowd, “to whom the Lord shall send a king, dressed in skins himself has cured, and his sceptre an ox's goad.” “Nevertheless,” said another, “an ox's goad in the hands of him with whom is the spirit of the Lord, were more than all the power of all the Herods. Remember Samson's jaw bone of an ass.” “Let him who accuseth Herod look to it,” cried an angry voice, “lest he fall into the jaws not of an ass, but a lion.” “That was the voice of Zadok,” said one aloud. “It was not the voice of Zadok,” cried the Rabbi, as he stalked gloomily away, and left the crowd behind. At this moment those with whom we had been standing about the steps of the synagogue and between the building and the walls of the outer court, were drawn to the street, by the loud tones of some one declaiming to the people, where, raised above the crowds upon a stone at the corner of the market, he stood reporting news which he had heard of a prophet having risen up among the hills of Idumea, and to whom all in that region were giving ear. The throng thickened around him, eagerly listening to what he had to say, and making inquiries concerning the time and manner of his appearing. They were interrupted by the voice of another from the crowd, who exclaimed, “Trust not these lying rumors, people of Beth-Harem; give no heed to them. I am but just arrived from the hills of Idumea on the way to Tiberias, where the people knew nothing of this prophet. Listen to the instructions of your ruler Shammai, and run not after every shadow.” While this person spoke, the other, who had delivered the news with so much boldness, mingled with the crowd and disappeared, pursued by the cries of the people. I now turned away, and leaving the city behind, bent my steps toward the Jordan. The soft breath of the fresh air burdened with spicy odors, together with the calm aspect of nature, was like a medicine, healing the distempered body, and restoring the mind also, after the feverish heats of the assembly I had left. I sought at once the banks of the river, that I might move quietly along in the solitude of its deep shadows, rather than mingle with those who, on the highway, would be passing in the same direction with myself. The atmosphere was temperate, and so still, it hardly so much as made the leaves to tremble on the lightest boughs, or the tenderest flowers to bend their heads. Birds and insects enjoying the sacredness of the day which gave them security against their common enemy, saluted the ear with their sweetest notes. The serpent, who glided across my path, startling me by his fearful shape and glistening hues, seemed to dread me less than on other days, and went slowly by. Reaching the stream, I seated myself upon a rock lying within the fields of Onias not far from the grotto of which I have already told you, and leaning against the trunk of an aged willow, gave myself to the thoughts which the scenes before me, and those which I had just witnessed, in Beth-Harem, equally suggested. How peaceful is nature! I thought — how calmly her various courses move on. There is here no confusion, jarring, and discord. The sun, the moon, and the stars all wheel around us, and the ear cannot hear the sound of their going, neither do they ever cross each other's path. All is peace, order, and silence. The trees and herbs all grow to their full stature, yet we see not, we hear not, as they go up from strength to strength. But with man all is rage, disorder, and strife. Nothing is quiet; no motion is without noise, interference, or conflict. In the mind of each individual there is warfare, peace never; and for nations, it seems their chosen work to injure or destroy. Within their own borders they chafe even among themselves; being uneasy in every present state, and while they look about for VOL. I. 27 beneficial changes — at least, for changes — know not what to choose, nor where the good they seek after is to be found, and often in the pursuit of a fancied advantage plunge into deeper ill. Why, and to what good end is this restlessness of our people? this discontent with the present, these expectations, this longing for a greater future, a wider kingdom? Is it of good? Is it of God? They are tossed, and sway to and fro, beating against each other, foaming with, as it seems, useless passion, even like the waves of the sea, driven by the winds — like this river, now indeed calm and sending forth the gentle music of its murmur as it rolls over its bed, or winds among these rocks and aged roots on its margin; but anon rushing onward with full and overflowing banks, uprooting the giants of the forest, and carrying destruction to the fields of the husbandman. But what then, is not all alike? Is nature, always, calm and peaceful? Is she not, even like man, subject to passionate outbreaks, to violent and sudden change, to uproar and wide-spread desolation? The sun and the stars are indeed quiet and still in their courses, and shed down wholesome influences; but, then the comet comes and glares upon the world, bringing with it pestilence, mildew, floods, and war. The solid earth quakes, and whole cities are engulphed. The winds, which now cannot be heard, to-morrow rise in tempests, and forests are torn in fragments, ships dashed in pieces, and the proudest works of man levelled with the ground. Animals prey upon one another; and even the tender dove pursues her diseased off-spring with cruelty. Is man worse than nature — nature better than man? Are they different? Should they be? Doubtless the same being hath made the whole. We are all alike. There is evil everywhere — evil in nature and evil in man. Whence is this and why? Alas! who can tell? But whither have I run? I rose from my rock on the river's side, and turned toward the house. I must needs pass the grotto. As I drew nigh, I perceived some one within. It was Judith, who had there passed in seclusion the time which I had spent by the river. She bounded towards me as I passed the entrance, and joining me we went through the vineyards, prolonging our walk, and as we went plucked here and there a half-dried bunch of grapes, which had been left hanging on its vine. “You went not,” I said, “to the synagogue within the walls.” “No,” she replied, “yet I joined our people in their worship. I accompanied those of our household, who frequent the synagogue hard by the Ox Ford. I knew that within the walls there would be confusion, at least that the peace of the hour would be destroyed; and I am unwilling to lose that peace, or to witness aught in the house of God that becomes not his service. How went it? Was Simon there?” I then related what had occurred. Judith seemed much struck by what had fallen from Simon, and finding that the disturbance had been so little, was sorry she had not been there. Concerning John, she was desirous to learn all that had been said. “This man,” said she, “seems in truth like one of the old Prophets. He not merely feeds the hopes of the people, but rebukes their hypocrisies and iniquities, and ere their hope can be fulfilled of the coming Kingdom, requires the heart to be made pure by repentance. In this, one beholds signs of truth. Impostors are not of this sort. Thinking more of some success of their own, than of the good of the people, they do but flatter them. Those in power especially do they seek to please. But this John — not only, if we hear aright, hath he published the faults and errors of the chief men of the nation, but even of Herod. Would that I might hear and see him! Would that I had heard his follower Simon!” At the hour of supper, the table of Onias was again surrounded by many of the chief citizens of Beth-Harem, with the Rulers, Shammai, Zadok, and Eleazer, and others whom the open hospitality of thy brother draws around him. They did not fail to attack Shammai as one who regarded with too much forbearance such as were proposing novelties, and impairing the common reverence both for the literal requirements of the Law, and the traditions of the Elders. “In truth,” said Zadok, “our Ruler is little better than a Sadducee, and what can be worse than a Sadducee? A pious Jew can think of nothing so bad.” “Were it true, that I am indeed a Sadducee,” replied Shammai, laughing, “I should find myself among no worse companions for forsaking my present friends, — even the rulers of the synagogue. I then might be able to boast of the alliance of Caiaphas and Annas, among many others equally honorable; and since thou knowest, Zadok, I am of a boastful nature, and yet have never made such boast, thou couldst not ask a better proof that I am sounder in my faith than thy words imply.” “In appearance,” replied Zadok, “thou art on the right side, but who can doubt thy little esteem for it, who hears thee defend, as to-day, perverters and deniers of the truth, railers, 27 * accusers, rebels, and blasphemers, like this wild preacher of the desert?” “All in Beth-Harem who know me,” rejoined Shammai, “know that I place not the same value in outward observances that many do, that I prefer the law to the traditions of the elders, and the reality of virtue to its semblance, and rate much higher goodness in the life, with fewer prayers at the corners of the streets, than a life less strict or secretly vile, with a great show of worship. I am not a Sadducee, inasmuch as I doubt not the resurrection of the just and the unjust, and hold to the existence of a spirit in man, and of spirits in the air and the Heavens; and yet again I am, because I think of our actions, that we may make them as we please, being free and not bound by fate in the use we make both of the body and mind. As for those who go about to teach the people either by the wayside, at the markets, or in the synagogue, I would not stop their mouths. Faith is many-sided, Zadok, and still faith, which side soever we choose. We trouble ourselves over-much as to what a man thinks. What have we to do with that which passeth within a man, so long as what he does, and what we see, is according to the rules of religion and the customs of men? Why should we go prying into the secrets of the spirit, and make it so much as the concern of a moment, as to their agreement with this great Rabbi, or another; with Hillel, or Simon the just, or Saddoc, or Judas? For myself, I choose out of many things, what I judge best, and pray that others may do the same; so shall peace be attained, and virtue be no less.” “Hear him! Hear him!” cried Zadok; “not less than John himself ought we to esteem him a traitor to the truth and a misleader of the people! It is well Shammai, that the people of Beth-Harem know more of thee than thy no-faith in Moses, or it would go hard with thee. “The people of Beth-Harem,” rejoined the Ruler, “see wider and farther than many of their countrymen, and it may be that some of their teachers are to be thanked for that. They have come to consider that he is the best disciple of Moses and the Prophets, who observes their precepts in their spirit, and while they see their spirit honored, allow some liberty in other things. If they are satisfied that the Ruler Shammai is just and faithful in his office, they will not rebuke him because he mingles together the good things to be found scattered among many teachers, and many sects. I doubt not, Zadok, much that would be valuable might be learned, even from this Satan, John, as I have already learned somewhat of value from his disciple. The fair Judith will agree with me.” “The daughter of Onias,” said Zadok, “is a daughter of a Pharisee of the straitest sect.” “I fear,” said Judith,” I shall give little pleasure to either side, to Shammai or Zadok, when I say, that I rest not wholly satisfied with the teachings of either the Pharisee or the Sadducee. But in this can I go with the good Shammai, that I would willingly hear what any holy man, who would instruct us, may have to say, whether a prophet of God, or but a common man. Surely the fruits of religion are not so rich, or abundant, but that we might greet with joy any new proposed doctrine, that should promise to act with better effect on the heart and life, and raise the general condition of man.” “Verily, Onias,” cried Zadok, “it seemeth to me as if I were sitting in the company of the uncircumcised. My ears are pierced as with a sharp sword. It becomes thee surely to take away the child from the false teaching of a Sadducee.” Shammai laughed heartily. Said Onias, “No, Zadok, Judith is of age; she hath her mind in her own keeping now, and must open or shut it, to darkness or light, as shall seem best to her. But even as her father is a Pharisee, and the son of a Pharisee, so do I deem her in spite of what thou hast now heard, to be a true daughter of Abraham. But when it shall be seen that Shammai leadeth her astray, then shall I call for thee to use thy power to convert her from the evil of her way.” “Ah, happy would that day be for thy daughter, and for Israel,” cried Zadok. “Shammai may have many virtues, but he hath not all.” “But Zadok has,” said the Ruler. “Daughter, how shalt thou possibly learn humility, the chief of virtues, of this man?” “If that virtue is chief on thy catalogue, it stands not so high on mine,” said Zadok, “nor on any other as I think.” “Well,” said Shammai, smiling, as Zadok took him so literally, “we will not dispute about that. I give thee joy, Judith, of thy teacher.” So it is with these Rulers, they are ever at odds, but their difference leads not to strife or anger, notwithstanding Zadok seems like one, who, if his passions were once roused, would rage with a fury that would overleap all bounds. Much as he in his heart dislikes what he deems the looseness of Shammai, and the light esteem in which he holds the minute observances which he himself, so highly values, as frequent washings, many fastings and prayers, together with a sacred reverence of all traditions, he yet cannot but revere in him a general innocence of life, and a goodness of heart, far exceeding his own, and most of those who would accuse him of unbelief. When the company was departed, the music had ceased, and the lamps which had been hung in the trees, for the reason that there was no moon, were extinguished, and those who had been disporting themselves were withdrawn, Onias took me with him apart as if to communicate somewhat of moment. “Julian,” said he, “the time draws on that there must be deeds as well as words, with those who would serve Israel. Much has already been achieved by messengers who have passed through the land, having communication with those who are of our part, and bringing over such, as it was found inclined the same way, and could be trusted. But more remains, and thy knowledge is now needed; but that it may yield the most and the best fruit, I would that thou shouldst see Herod. He alone can lay open before thee the true condition of the affair we have taken in hand, and which, borne onward with one spirit, shall crown the land and us with honor. The Tetrarch has heard of thy doings at Cæsarea, and it is no displeasure to him, that thou hast fallen into discredit with Pilate. He desires to see thee, and I have said that I would urge thy presence at Machærus, where Herod yet abides.” I replied, that I would seek him there without delay, as I should with pleasure visit so celebrated a spot as the fortress and city of Machærus, and with hardly less, the country that was to be traversed in the way thither. And indeed, more than all, was I curious to see Herod himself. Onias said, that he could not accompany me, as at first he had purposed to do, since it was necessary for him to depart in another direction, and he left me to take my own time and way, offering the use of both his stables and slaves. Thus, my mother, am I binding myself to the fate of Judea — an issue so little to have been conceived as possible but so little while ago. I have passed in so short a time, and by the power of such extraordinary events, from the life and the feelings of a Roman, to the character, and the habits, and faith of a Jew, that I can hardly believe myself to be the same person who dwelt with you in Rome, nor can I think that all this has happened without the interposing of a hand, of whose guidance we all are the subjects, though ignorant when and in what manner, and in the arrangement of what events, it is put forth. Happy for us that we stand not at the helm of our little vessel, but instead, some good angel who seeth farther and better, and hath a stronger arm, and who, though he guideth us sometimes on shallows, sometimes on quicksands, and sometimes among rocks and eddies, doth it that our experience may be more various, and so good be shown to make a part of all evil. Who, if he might, would dare to choose for himself among the possible events of life? Who so bold as, if it were permitted him, to be the pilot of his own bark, seeing so often as we do in the issue of events, that what at a distance we had dreaded, and if we could, would have shunned, hath proved benignant in our experience of it, and that what we had greatly desired, had it happened, could have been no other than disastrous or fatal. And how greatly will our judgments of this kind be confirmed and extended when, as in the resurrection of the just, we shall look back upon the whole of life, and behold each event as it stands bound to every other, both with those which preceded it and those that come after. In the light of that vast survey, the names which we now give to many events will be changed, or quite reversed, — evil will be seen to be good, and good, evil. Great delight and large profitings have come to me, when thinking thus, from the pages of David, Solomon, and the Prophets. There seems to be no mood of the mind, which finds not in them its proper nourishment or medicine. Rightly was the son of David named the Wise. The heart with all its weaknesses and errors, and life with all its lights and shadows, and in all its changes, are by him painted with so much truth, that the reader sees not whence such stores of knowledge could have come, save from the inspiration of God. Else, methinks, he must have lived life over many times, and in his own fortunes experienced the various lots of different persons, which we cannot believe, unless we agree with the philosophers of India, or receive the fancies of Pythagoras. In David, moreover, who can fail to find the thoughts and the words in which, whether he be joyous and grateful, or afflicted and penitent, cheerful or desponding, he can best offer up his sacrifice to God. No power, no words, of his own could avail so well. David, the sinner, and David, the saint, as he was now a sufferer, and now an enjoyer, has alike set forth his sorrows and his joys before God, in prayer and praise; and there, as in a mirror, doth every one who, like him, has sinned and suffered, or obeyed and rejoiced, behold his own VOL. I. 28 soul truly reflected. In none, either of the philosophers of Greece, or the moralists of Rome, do I find so much of human life justly depicted, of the human heart so clearly revealed. Nor, which is much more, do they ever speak in that tone of sincerity, which marks the prophets of Judea; and it is this virtue in a writer of morals above all others, that deserves our affection and reverence. The Jew writes of life and man, as if it were a matter not of art, but of life and death; the Greek and the Roman, as if to treat a subject as becomes a rhetorician. The Jew writes to help and save him who may read; the Roman or the Greek, to display his genius in a perfect treatise. The Jew therefore we love and obey as a divinity; the Roman or the Greek we honor as an artist who has completed a beautiful work. For the last we have admiration; for the first sighings, and tears, and an altered life. Farewell, my mother, and the blessings of all the Prophets be upon thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">XII. As Onias had desired, that I should without delay set forth on my journey to Machæ rus, I should have departed on the morning of the first day of the week, but that some other cares detained me, and, especially, the necessity I felt to be upon me to keep my promise to the poor Leper, whom I was to visit at his own home. Wherefore, instead of immediately making for Machærus, I turned first towards Beth-Harem to seek out the dwelling of the beggar. From his account of its place, it was easily found near to the inn bearing the sign of the High Priest painted upon its front. Just beyond it, stood a shapeless mass of extensive ruins, whose broken roofs and crumbling walls kept out neither the heats of summer nor the rains and cold of winter — this was pointed out to me as the abode of the wretched outcast. The rooms immediately upon the street I found unoccupied, but as I penetrated farther into the gloomy recesses, and then paused to consider which way I should turn, — it was the sixth hour, — I was arrested by the voice of one as if in prayer. I stood still, and heard with distinctness the voice of a girl, as it seemed to me, rehearsing, as if from memory, a Psalm of David, where he deplores and confesses his sins, and cries out from the great deeps of his distress, for pity and pardon. The voice having ceased, the tones of another, which I at once remembered as those of the leper, fell on my ear; “Now, my child, that thou hast repeated those words of the good king and prophet, let me hear thy voice in prayer also;” with which request the daughter complying, I heard the same low and sorrowful voice lifted up in prayer to God. Yet, though the voice was as of one who was burdened, the themes on which it dwelt, were such as to inspire cheerfulness and gratitude, rather than sorrow or repining. Many blessings were enumerated that had been bestowed upon them who were ready to perish, by the good providence of God, and by the hands of those who had been moved to take pity on them. When the worship was over, I moved from where I had stood, and advancing toward the door of the inner room, passed it, and stood before them. It was a pitiful, yet pleasing spectacle that presented itself. The beggar was seated in a corner of the room, upon a pile of clean straw or rushes, leaning against the wall, with face upturned as if to catch the light that streamed in from a single window, or crevice in the wall, while at his side, also crouched upon the straw, sat her whose voice I had heard, and who had already taken in her hands withes, which, with nimble fingers, she was weaving into baskets. Some jars and coarse pottery, with a few rude seats, were the only objects in the room. The daughter looked up at my approach, but without surprise, as if accustomed to the intrusion of visitors through the open doors and fissures. The voice of the old man, as his ear caught my footstep, was first heard, “Who comes here, my child?” “A stranger,” she replied. “Not wholly a stranger,” I answered. “It was I, who yesterday, doubting the truth of your word, promised to see where you dwelt.” “It is not much,” replied the old man, “to say you are welcome to such a place as this; but I am glad to hear your voice again. It was far better to hear your voice yesterday, than the clatter of the brass which the Pharisee showered upon me, which but for you I could never have found. My child had left me for a space, and I alone could not have gathered it up; besides, that others would have snatched it from me. It was the same man who a little 28* after caused me to be driven away by the servants of the synagogue, with reproaches and blows, as a Sabbath breaker. But if I broke the Sabbath by begging, he broke it as well by giving.” “He could not resist the fine occasion,” I answered, “of making a show of his benevolence.” “That was it, I am sure,” answered the daughter, “though I would not say so of any whom we did not well know. But that Pharisee is known to be very rich, and yet exacting towards all who are dependent on him, casting into prison such as owe him but a few pence. Surely the heart of such a one is not right.” “And then,” said the father, “afterwards showing his zeal for the Sabbath day by setting the servants of the synagogue to drive me away. I knew well that it was held unlawful by many to give on the Sabbath; but I thought within myself, there would be out of the great crowds I heard would be gathered together, some who would think, that, to give an alms would be as acceptable an offering, as to stand within and pray.” “Surely it must be so,” said the daughter, “the Sabbath is kept, and God is worshipped by doing good, as well as by saying prayers, and reading the law. Is it not, Sir?” “I think so indeed. The law but requires us to rest on the Sabbath, and not profane it. It is men who add the observances of which you complain. But why,” I asked, “do you beg?” addressing the daughter, “is not your labor sufficient for your honest support?” “Oh no, Sir; it brings us but very little, hardly enough to supply our food, besides which we must pay for our portion of this crazy tenement. But the people of Beth-Harem are kind to us, lepers though we be. Yet would they avoid us, doubtless, had they not known us in our better days. You need not fear anything, Sir, because I tell you my father is a leper. The physicians say that he will suffer no more, and that no one now will receive it from him.” I said that I feared it not; and asked how it was, that while her father had suffered so much she had herself escaped? “Verily,” cried the father, “through the good providence of God, — by a miracle of his loving kindness. But beside her, all are lost, all.” I then inquired how so great a calamity had overtaken them. “I will tell you,” replied the cripple. “My birth place is this very Beth-Harem. But when I became of age, and had chosen what employment I would follow, my father gave to me and a younger brother so much of his fortune as he could part with, and we departed for Tyre, that we might traffic there as merchants; for we both preferred that way of life to any other. There we prospered for many years. We each took a wife, and our children grew up around us. But my brother, not content with the measure of our good fortune, which was already more than that of any merchant in Tyre, being given also to excess in his manner of living, resolved to travel into India, and even China, for the sake of the great riches which many had found there, and which he was sure he should find also. But, alas! he had been gone but a brief space of time, when I discovered that in ways, which I had not suspected, he had wasted a great part of our substance by debts he had contracted, and soon in addition to these, instead of wealth flowing in from the East, I was also obliged to use what was left, in payment for losses he had incurred there, partly through error, and partly through riotous living. Thus was the prosperity of the morning of our life already over. But this we might have borne, and from it recovered, had not a greater and unlooked for calamity ensued. When for a long time we had had no tidings of my brother, we were roused at midnight by the cry of the servants, that he had returned. It was he in truth; and we received him, as one whom, though he had greatly erred, we still loved. We embraced him with affection, and tried to surpass each other in offices of friendship, in which we were the more ready, as he said that by reason of the fatigue of the way he had fallen ill. But when the morning came, what was our horror, to behold him white with the leprosy! The plague could not be stayed. It was in the state which is most dangerous to those who approach it, and seized both our households, the old and the young. We were before beggars; now we were lepers also. All fled from us. My wife and my children died, their limbs dropping off one after another. This one alone being spared, upon whom, through the good providence of God, the disease never laid its loathsome touch. My brother, the author of all our miseries yet lives; and his wretched family with him, as if to add to his unhappiness by the continual reproaches their sufferings utter. And truly doth he deserve all he endures. My lot is happy, compared with his, in that those whom I loved died, and so escaped what the rest endure; and this blessed child, who alone lives, was too pure for the foul curse to come near her. My hope, by night and by day, is, that I may soon perish, and release her from this cruel bondage. It were a sin to pray for death, but I may hope it.” The girl wept bitterly, as her father said these things. It seemed to be indeed as he had said, that there was somewhat too pure in her for disease to harm her; for notwithstanding the extremity of their poverty, there was none of its loathsomeness about her; but though poor, her garments were clean, as was the straw on which she sat, and her countenance was bright with the hues of health. I asked concerning his brother, and whether he too was in Beth-Harem. “No,” he answered, “he separated himself from all whom he had known, and departed for the desert. He inhabits a solitary dwelling on the burning sands, where the Jordan leads toward the salt sea, dependent upon the mercies of the passing traveller, the shepherd and the hunter, — who, as they pass, will throw them a little food, — and upon what fish they can sometimes catch in the river. But of this they must be deprived as, one after another, their members become diseased and perish.” I said, that I thought it strange, that having been born in Beth-Harem, and being well known, there were not more who were prompt to aid him, and diminish farther the evils of his lot. He said that he had not long been returned to Beth-Harem, and but few of the inhabitants knew he was there. “But,” he added, “so great is their horror of this plague, that they would not approach me; and it must be added also, that they accuse me of the faults of my brother, and visit the punishment upon my head, as well as his, who alone was guilty.” Then bestowing upon them such relief as would amply supply their present wants, I departed, assuring them I should see them again, when I should have returned from my journey. Hastening back again to the dwelling of Onias, I passed the remainder of the day in making such preparations as were needful for the road, and for an absence of many days. To Ziba I could entrust the chief part of these cares. I did not fail to relate to Judith all I had learned of the Leper and his daughter, and to raise such an interest for them in her heart, as to engage her active exertions in their behalf. Though professing, and really feeling, all the horror which any do of the disease of leprosy, and like all of this people believing it infectious in all stages of its progress, she yet promised that by some means which she would trust her ingenuity to devise, she would contribute of her abundance to their comfort. When the morning of the second day had come, I set forth, with Ziba as my companion, for the region of the Dead Sea. The cooler weather that announces the approach of winter beginning to prevail, our preparations were different from those which were to be made when we took our departure from Cæsarea. But though the winter is near at hand, occasionally there happen days of little less burning heat than in the summer months; in the night, the cold, with heavy dews, always returning. The forests still retain their leaves, though their verdure is partly gone. Our way lay in a plain course in the direction of the river, by following which, without turning either to the right or left, we could not fail to arrive at our destined haven, inasmuch as the city and fortress of Machærus are visible at the point where the Jordan empties into the sea. We might have made our path shorter, by striking across the plain where the Jordan bends, as it doth below where the Heshbon joins it, far to the West; but for the sake of the greater pleasantness of the road, we kept on the lower banks of the river. We wound along, therefore, among many villages, and cultivated grounds, without interruption, until, in the neighborhood of Jericho the land loses its fertility, and stretches out on every side, a wide and barren desert of rock and sand. But after leaving Beth-Harem, we entered upon this fertile tract I have spoken of, lying first immediately upon the borders of the stream, and then stretching toward the east, till, after not many leagues, it meets the mountains, which, running from north to south, form a wall, as it were, between Judea and the farther east. Of those mountains, the nearer were the hills of Gilead, partly bare, rocky, and torn by the descending torrents of the early spring; partly covered with the same forests and verdure, that clothed the plains at their roots. The walls and towers of frequent villages, breaking through the dark foliage, with their white lines, gave a new beauty to the scene. I cannot but be of the opinion, that neither in the neighborhood of Rome or Naples, nor on the plains of the Po, is there anything more rare or beautiful to be seen, than that which here lay before me; which must be taken as high commendation, seeing that my prejudices are still (in spite of my present choice) in favor of the earlier scenes of my youth. Ziba was clear that these plains were VOL. I. 29 no way inferior to those of Esdraelon. Crossing the Heshbon on a bridge of Roman structure, from which we could just discern the pinnacles of Heshbon itself, we soon came to Bethabara, a village not large but agreeably situated, not far from Jordan, and shaded by surrounding groves of palms, poplars, and sycamore. Passing through it, we discovered that very soon we must enter upon the sands of the desert; for, from a rising ground, which we were obliged to ascend, we beheld the cultivated lands gradually yielding to rock and barren fields; all signs of verdure being confined to the thickets of willow and olive, that, until within a few miles of the Dead Sea, continue to line the banks of the river. Rising high on the eastern side of the prospect, we beheld the tops of Mount Pisgah, and the Mountains of Nebo, and farther in the same direction, and towards the south, the bleak and glistening summits of the hills of Arabia. It was when the sun had reached his highest point, and his rays were falling upon us, almost with the power of the summer solstice, that we entered upon the wild and savage region, blasted by the hand of God himself because of the sins of its inhabitants, which extends from the neighborhood of Jericho on either side of the river, even unto the further extremity of the sea. The plains of this desert, which lie elevated far above the Jordan, present to the eye only one unvaried scene of desolation; being composed of whitish rocks just breaking through the parched earth, or of moving sands, or else of soil seamed with cracks and fissures, occasioned by long droughts, and also by sudden and violent torrents from the mountains in the season of the rains, which wear their way by a thousand channels to the river. When entered upon this dismal region, the river, though but at a small distance from us, was no longer visible, nor even the thickets which clothe its banks, nor would one believe that they so much as had any existence, so far were they sunk below the level of this arid tract. All we could see, therefore, was but a wide prospect of shining sand, painful for the eye to look upon, bounded in the dim and hazy distance by lofty precipices of rock. But, new to me, it possessed its own charms, as doth everything that the hand of God has made — the wild and the terrible, as well as the calm and the beautiful. Nay, the awe of his presence is a more sensible influence among such scenes as these; since as there is no other being whom he permits to dwell there, no other to divert our thoughts, we imagine him to make it his peculiar abode, and think of him alone. Where men dwell together, in thick and prosperous communities, and we behold on every side the forms of human art, or else nature wholly altered by that art, and thrown into shapes which his mind has conceived, then we are ever prone to rest in the nearest and feeblest cause of what we see, to think more of the changes which man has wrought in what was brought ready prepared to his hand, than of the awful power that effected the first creation, and called into being the first substance. The scenes of nature wild and untenanted, even as they came from the hand of their Maker, are of most power on the mind. Thus too the ocean moves the soul more than the land. We had approached toward the midway point of this desert region, having seen of living things, only here and there in the distance the form of an Arab horseman, or the long neck of a camel moving among the rocks, when we beheld what appeared to be a cluster of ruinous dwellings, whose walls of white stone shone in the hot glances of the sun with a dazzling radiance. No tree or shrub was near to break the rays of the sun; they stood undefended and, as we supposed, uninhabited in their fearful solitude. Ziba, thinking they might with reason be the resort of plunderers and robbers, who greatly infest the roads lying between Jerusalem, Jericho, and the borders of the Dead Sea, counselled that we should avoid them, by taking a course nearer the Jordan. But curiosity prevailing over apprehension, we kept on our way, and with the less concern, that they stood on what must be the common road which travellers would take, on their journeys to Machærus, or Herodium. When we had drawn so near as to see the buildings more distinctly, with their white walls, and dark shadows cast on the burning sand, and had paused a moment, there suddenly rushed from out the ruins lean and half-starved dogs, who filled the air with their prolonged and doleful howling. Fit guardians they seemed of the foul spirits that could alone inhabit dwellings more fearful and dismal than the tombs themselves. The dogs continuing their savage yells, yet, as they struck us, rather melancholy and mournful in their sound than fierce, we kept on our way, and drew still nearer, though it was with difficulty we urged on our horses, who seemed to dread an approach, even more than ourselves. The walls showed here and there small loop-holes, or windows, but the eye could see nothing but the deep blackness of space within. As I looked steadily at one of these openings, a human face suddenly appeared, and was as quickly withdrawn; but, seen only for a moment, it made known by its scaly, death-like whiteness, who and what the inhabitants 29 * were. Here, I could not doubt, dwelt the leprous household of the brother of the Beth-Harem beggar. I called upon Ziba, who was hastening forward, to stop. At the same moment passing a projecting wall, I there beheld the members of this miserable family, lying basking in the rays of the sun, rather like swine than creatures in the human form. The dogs ceased their baying, and came round fawning as if for food. Soon as the lepers — lying as it were half asleep — were conscious of our presence they cried out as with one accord, in hoarse and unnatural tones, “Food — food — give us food,” — at the same time stretching out their hands, from which some or all the fingers had fallen. “Food — give us food, else may the curse of leprosy cleave to you — may the air that blows over us taint you with the plague a thousand leagues over the desert.” “Cease to curse,” said I “and we will throw you food. But do you not fear to blaspheme, seeing what the punishment of your sins is?” This they received with hoarse laughter. “What should we fear? What is worse than this? Out upon you, hypocrite! Throw us food, or begone.” “I would ask you,” I began — “Insult us not; ask nothing; — throw us food, I say, and begone.” He who had said these things — his face, at first, white with its leprous crusts, but now bloated, and red with impotent rage — while he spoke, had half raised himself from the sand. He now seized a broken fragment of the wall to hurl at us; the others at the same time, crying out to the dogs to attack us. Struck with horror at such a spectacle, we threw down the food we could spare, and fled upon our way — their curses, and the baying of the famished dogs dying gradually away as we rode. It was a long while ere I could so banish from my mind the scene I had witnessed, as to take note of the way. We rode along in silence. I could think only of the miserable fate that had overtaken a household reared once in prosperity and luxury. How low they must have fallen, I thought, in their sense of God and right, while yet the day of their prosperity shone bright, for adversity to plunge them so deep in beastliness and impiety. Their leprosy seemed but the least portion of the evil that had overtaken them. Their bodies were in health and beauty, compared with their souls. “Doubtless they had forsaken God long before he suffered the punishment of their errors finally to fall upon them.” So judged Ziba. “Those wretches,” continued he, “must have sinned with industry even from their birth, to bring down so fearful a judgment.” I told him what I had heard from the leper in Beth-Harem, and who I supposed them to be. At this Ziba recollected himself, and said, that “doubtless it was as I supposed. He had heard at Tyre of what I had related; and as he had been told, it was rare that wickedness and impiety proceed to such excesses as in the younger of the two brothers. There were few in Tyre whom he had not injured. The wealth of the poor, of the widow, and the orphan he had obtained as a trust, and then devoted to his pleasures, and the luxurious indulgence of his household. His children grew up in sin. When he returned from India, he was well aware that when he entered his own doors, it was as a leper; but his heart was so hardened, that he said, They shall perish also. They did perish, indeed, by this living death. And the curse that had fallen from the hand of God, clave unto him also, and cleaveth yet and will cleave forever; for his soul is leprous more than the body, and that shall be in the resurrection even as it is now. Shall it not?” I said that I could not but think so. “Yet,” said Ziba, “the Priests will tell us, that the children of Abraham shall be saved, and their sins shall not hinder — while no others shall, be they never so pure.” “But others,” I replied, “do not so judge. And these perhaps may know the truth as well as they.” “I believe it,” answered Ziba. “The best that I have heard of the Prophet on the Jordan — the Baptizer — is, that to the boasting Pharisees and Doctors from Jerusalem, who think whether they fulfil all rightenousness or not, they shall be saved, he said, `It is of no worth, your claim on Abraham as your father, for God can raise up at any moment from the very stones of the street children to Abraham, who shall come in and claim all that belonged to his true descendants.”' “If he has said so,” I answered, “he has said a good thing, and doubtless true as the righteousness of God.” So conversing we continued on our way until, as we ascended a little knoll of sand, Ziba cried out, saying, — “Behold! the Dead Sea!” I looked where he pointed, and it was plainly to be seen stretching away to the south till lost in the extreme distance. “And there, on the left at the head of the lake,” continued Ziba, “can the eye just discern the high rocks on which stand the city and fortress we are in search of.” They were indeed just visible. But as we moved on at a quicker pace, they rapidly emerged from the dimness in which they first appeared, and began to assume their proper forms. The same scene continued to surround us, save that the whole plain of the desert began to slope toward the huge basin of the sea, and the sand to become more light and soft, and the low rocks to disappear. We now, too, had brought into sight the great highways from Idumea, winding round the head of the lake, and those from the northern parts of the Peræa, all leading to Machærus, which, since its restoration by Herod the Great, has been not only a post of defence and repository for munitions of war, but likewise a place of resort for the merchants who trade between Arabia, Jerusalem, and Tyre, and the general coast of the Mediterranean. Along these main channels of communication we could now see horsemen, travellers on foot, and long lines of loaded camels, either bent towards Machærus or Herodium, or else, going from these cities towards the west and north. The Dead Sea now opened before me in all its grandeur and boundless extent. While the shore at the northern extremity, where the Jordan sends in its there dull and muddy stream, is but a vast waste of sand, all flat and low, even to the water's edge, the eastern and western shores are on the other hand, bold and sublime, with mountains of every wild and jagged form running down to the shore itself in lofty and abrupt precipices of bare and shattered rock, then retreating into the interior and rising into loftier summits still. Between these ranges of hills lay the mysterious sea, heavy and motionless, as if indeed dead. No ripple broke its surface, no wave murmured along the shore — weltering only among the loose rocks piled along its margin. The silence as of death rested over it. The waters of this inland ocean, heavy with salt, their surface covered with an oily film which impedes the action of the winds, and being moreover without tides strike the eye at once as different from all others — from those of the Great Sea always in motion by reason of its tides, and from those of other lakes which fresh and light are curled by the gentlest breath of air that passes over them. Had this sea, instead of water, presented to the eye a surface of white polished silver, where every object on its sides was reflected with the perfection of reality, it would not have differed from what I saw, nor filled the mind with more astonishment. When we drew near, and impatient of delay, attempted in the most direct manner to reach the shore, we were instantly defeated by the soft and treacherous sands into which our horses sank. This compelled us to wind round the bay, which forms the upper extremity, that we might gain a rocky shore lying under a low cape, or promontory, that divided us from the city and fortress of Machærus. Having accomplished our object, we stood upon the rocks against which the water lay, reached down and tasted for ourselves its exceeding bitterness, and looked into those clear depths which the eye penetrates as they were composed of crystal. It demanded but slight effort of the fancy to make me believe, that far down in those dismal solitudes, I beheld the pinnacles and towers, the temples and the walls of the devoted cities; and that I could still hear, as the peasants affirm they ever do, the moaning or the imprecations of the wicked spirits there overwhelmed, and whom the justice of God still binds in their watery prisons. I lay along upon the rocks and gazed, and listened, till I was weary, and I was roused by Ziba's voice, saying, that it was time we set on for Machærus, would we reach that place before night.
