      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. TO Mrs. BINGHAM. MADAM, I am not ignorant that the style of dedications in general, is that of panegyric, where the author endeavours to elevate the character of their patron or patroness, above that of every other human being. But I am sensible were I to address a person of your understanding, in the language of adulation, I should only excite your contempt. Nor is it necessary for me, to set forth, the many amiable traits, in a character so well known, so universally esteemed and respected as Mrs. Bingham's. I sincerely wish Madam, that this work was a more perfect performance, that it might be more worthy your acceptance, and the honour you have done me, in permitting me to dedicate it to you. Such as it is, it may perhaps innocently amuse a leisure hour; and under the protecting sanction of your name, I do not fear its meeting a favourable reception from the public in general. For however trifling its own merits, your patronage will stamp a value on it, and raise it into that consequence, it otherwise could never attain. I have the honour to be, Madam, your much obliged And very humble servant, SUSANNA ROWSON. Philadelphia, April 13th, 1795.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. As a person of sensibility, whom business or necessity, forces into the house of an entire stranger, (especially if that stranger is his superior in genius, education or rank,) experiences a sensation undescribably painful, in being necessiated to announce himself, and explain the intent of his visit: so I feel myself inexpressibly embarrassed and timid, whilst performing the unavoidable task of writing a Preface. It is addressing myself to, and calling up the attention of a multiplicity of strangers; it is introducing not myself indeed, but what is nearly the same thing, the offspring of my imagination, to their notice, and conscious as I am, that it will be perused by those, who are infinitely my superiors, this awkward timidity encreases, to an almost unconquerable degree. “The works of fiction,” says Dr. Johnson, “with which the present ge “neration seems more particularly de “lighted; are such as exhibit life in “its true state, diversified only by ac “cidents that daily happen in the “world, and influenced by passions “and qualities, which are really to be “found in conversing with mankind. “In narratives, where historical vera “city has no place, I cannot discover “why there should not be exhibited “a most perfect idea of virtue, not an “gelical, nor above probability; for “what we cannot credit, we shall ne “ver imitate; but the highest and pur “est that humanity can reach, which “exercised in such trials as the various “revolutions of things shall bring up “on it, may, by conquering some ca “lamities, and enduring others, teach “us what we may hope, and what we “can perform.” Vol. I. b Upon this plan I have endeavoured to form the “Trials of the Human Heart.” My Heroine, though not wholly free from error, (for where shall we find the human being that is so?) I trust is not altogether unworthy imitation. Through various trying situations, as daughter, wife, and mother; I have strove to conduct her with propriety, tempering the weakness of humanity with the patience and fortitude of a Christian, and that dignified pride, which will ever arise from a just sense of the moral virtues. It is with reluctance I find myself obliged to remark, that the literary world is infested with a kind of loathsome reptile, of the class of non-descripts, for it cannot be ranked with propriety amongst either authors or critics, not possessing the qualifications necessary to form either, and being in itself remarkable for nothing but its noxious qualities: its only aim is to prevent the success of any work of genius; and swelling with envy, should the smallest part of public favour, be conferred on another, spits out its malignant poison, in scurrility and detraction. One of these noisome reptiles, has lately crawled over the volumes, which I have had the temerity to submit to the public eye. I say crawled over them, because I am certain it has never penetrated beyond the title-page of any. Perhaps it would be as well, did I suffer this circumstance to pass unnoticed; the arguments used, I must confess, are unanswerable, being in some parts incomprehensible, and in others of such a nature, that no woman can glance her eye over them, without feeling the blush of offended delicacy crimson her cheek. Yet, as I have been accused of writing in an improper style in my Novel of the “Fille de Chambre,” and of expressing sentiments foreign to my heart, in my Comedy of “Slaves in Algiers,” I think it necessary to assure the candid and impartial public, that both these assertions are equally false and scandalous. Though many a leisure hour has been amused, and many a sorrowful one beguiled, whilst giving Fancy the reins, I have applied myself to my pen, it has ever been my pride, that I never yet wrote a line that might tend to mislead the untutored judgment, or corrupt the inexperienced heart; and heaven forbid I should suffer ought to escape my pen, that might call a blush to the cheek of innocence, or deserve a glance of displeasure from the eye of the most rigid moralist. As to my opinion of the political concerns of America, or my wishes in regard to her welfare, I cannot better explain them, than by giving a slight sketch of my private history, with which, I rather imagine, the creature alluded to, is entirely unacquainted. It was my fate, at a period when memory can scarcely retain the smallest trace of the occurrence, to accompany my father, (Mr. William Haswell, who is a lieutenant in the British navy) to Boston in New England, where he had married a second wife, my mother having lost her life in giving me existence. Blest with a genteel competency, and placed by his rank and education in that sphere of life, where the polite and friendly attentions of the most respectable characters courted our acceptance, and enjoying a constant intercourse with the families of the officers of the British army and navy, then stationary there, eight years of my life glided almost imperceptibly away. At that time the dissentions between England and America encreased to an alarming degree: my father bore the king's commission, he had taken the oath of allegiance; certain I am that no one who considers the nature of an oath, voluntarily taken, no one who reflects, that previous to this period, he had served thirty years under the British government, will blame him for a strict adherence to principles which were interwoven as it were with his existance. He did adhere to them, the attendant consequence may readily be supposed; his person was confined, his property confiscated. Then it was that the benevolence and philanthropy, which so eminently distinguish the sons and daughters of Columbia made an indeliable impression on my heart, an impression which neither time or chance can obliterate, for while their political principles obliged them to afflict, the humanity, the Christian like benevolence of their souls, incited them to wipe the tears of sorrow from the eyes of my parents, to mitigate their sufferings, and render those afflictions in some measure supportable. Would to Heaven it was in my power to render their memories as immortal, as my gratitude is unbounded. Having been detained as a prisoner two years and an half, part of which was spent in Hingham, and part in Abington; an exchange of prisoners taking place between the British and Americans, my father and his family were sent by cartel to Halifax, from whence we embarked for England. I will not pretend to describe the sorrow I experienced, in being thus separated from the companions of my early years: every wish of my heart was for the welfare and prosperity of a country, which contained such dear, such valuable friends, and the only comfort of which my mind was capable, was indulging in the delightful hope, of being at some future period permitted again to revisit a land so beloved, companions so regretted. Too young at that time, to have formed any political principles of my own, I may naturally be supposed to have adopted those of my father, but the truth is, that equally attached to either country, the unhappy dissentions affected me in the same manner as a person may be imagined to feel, who having a tender lover, and an affectionate brother who are equally dear to her heart, and by whom she is equally beloved, sees them engaged in a quarrel with, and fighting against each other, when, let whichsoever party conquer, she cannot be supposed insensible to the fate of the vanquished. During a period of twelve years a variety of painful circumstances unnecessary here to recount, contributed to deprive me of a decent independence inherited from my paternal grandfather, and at length to bring me back to America, in a very different situation, I must confess, from that in which I left it; but with a heart, still glowing with the same affectionate sensations, and exulting in its evident improvement: the arts are encouraged, manufactures increase, and this happy land bids fair to be in the course of a few years the most flourishing nation in the universe. Is it then wonderful, that accustomed from the days of childhood, to think of America and its inhabitants with affection, linked to them by many near connections, and sincerely attached to them, from principles of gratitude, that I should offer the most ardent prayers for a continuation of their prosperity, or that feeling the benign influence of the blessings of peace and liberty, here so eminently enjoyed, I should wish that influence extended throughout every nation under heaven. Before I conclude, I beg leave to say a few words more, concerning my present publication. I am willing to flatter myself, that in offering this novel to the public, I am not preparing for my future life, either shame or repentance. That it is throughout the whole, happily imagined or highly polished, I have not sufficient confidence in my own abilities to warrant; but whatever may be my final sentence from the world in general, I have at least endeavoured to deserve their kindness, nor shall I envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause, if I may be so happy as to awaken in the bosoms of my youthful readers, a thorough detestation of vice, and a spririted emulation, to embrace and follow the precepts of Piety, Truth and Virtue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. B LETTER I. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. Woodbine Cot, April 20th, 1775.

We formed erroneous opinions of the world; we thought it a paradise compared to the solemnity and gloom of our convent. Trust me, my dear, I have as yet found nothing, in this gay, busy world, half so pleasing, as that sweet retirement. But I forget that this is my first letter, and that you naturally wish to know every incident which has happened since our separation. This innocent curiosity shall be gratified, and to begin: During our journey, Mr. Verdome informed me that the reason of my being sent for home so suddenly, was to attend Mrs. Mirvan, my godmother, who had been for a long time ill, and was supposed to be in a deep decline. “She went to Bristol,” continued he, “a few days before I left England; your mother accompanied her, your father and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the ensuing week; we shall, therefore, on our arrival in England, set forward immediately for that place. “Who is Mrs. Talbot?” said I. “She is,” replied Mr. Verdome, “a widow lady, who, being left in rather indigent circumstances, and being a distant relation of the family, has accepted an asylum in your father's house.” “If she is an amiable woman,” said I, “my mother must be happy in having such a companion.” “She is sensible, well bred, and good antured,” he replied—and here the conversation dropped. I was, as you may easily imagine, too much taken up with the disagreeable sensation of sea-sickness, to be able to reflect much, while crossing the channel: but no sooner was I in the chaise, proceeding toward Bristol, than I began to form a thousand different ideas about meeting my parents, not having seen either of them since I could remember. I pictured them to myself, as very amiable old people—and, in fancy, felt their embraces and kissed off the tears of joy I saw falling from their eyes. Celia, we children of simplicity form strange enthusiastic notions. In thinking of my dear Mrs. Mirvan, I felt more lively sensations; because I was certain if she lived, when I arrived, I should be received by her with heart-felt satisfaction, and should I find her no more, my own heart would experience the most acute anguish. You must remember how much I am indebted to her tenderness and affection, and how very happy I was whenever she visited our convent. At length we arrived at the end of our journey. I trembled so, that I could scarcely support myself. Expectation, hope, fear, by turns were predominant in my bosom. When we stopped, a handsome man, in appearance about five and thirty or forty years of age, handed me from the chaise, and saluting me, said to Mr. Verdome, “faith she is a very fine girl.” I saw Mr. Verdome srown; but had not time to make any further remarks, before I found myself in the chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how that dear woman was altered; her face pale, eyes sunk and so reduced that she could not rise to meet me. She faintly smiled when I entered the room, I could not speak. I saw nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and running to her threw my arms round her neck and burst into tears. “Dear creature,” said Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) “we have surprised her. She was not prepared to see me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears; here is another lady, who indeed should have been the first object of your attention.” I turned round and beheld the most beautiful woman, you can conceive, bending over me, her eyes full of tears. “My child, my beloved Meriel,” said she, taking me in her arms; “have you no recollection of your mother?” Whilst I was folded in her maternal embrace the door opened, and my mother continued, “come Mr. Howard welcome your daughter.” I raised my head from my dear mother's bosom, and was surprised to see the B 2 same gentleman, who had handed me from the chaise. “Your father, Meriel,” said my mother. I bent one knee to the ground and kissed his hand. But shall I confess that whilst in that action, which should have expressed filial respect and love, I felt more of terror than either. “Rise girl, rise,” said he, “I have no taste for these fine romantic scenes. You knelt, because you were told it would be expected, not from any genuine impulse of the heart.” My poor mother looked distressed. “I hope,” said I, in a faultering voice, “I hope, sir, my conduct will henceforth convince my dear parents, that I am wanting in neither duty nor affection.” “We shall see,” said he, carelessly. “You women in general talk well, but as to your obedience and submission, when you are put to the trial you always fall far short of your professions.” I saw the tears stand in my mother's eyes. Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for a whimpering party, I shall leave you to yourselves, and go and finish my game at piquet with Mrs. Talbot. When he was gone, I felt myself relieved, and entered into conversation with my mother and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not but observe the hard struggle my dear parent had to repress her tears; I dared not notice her distress, least by so doing, I should increase it: besides I judged, that however palpable my father's errors might be, it would be an ungrateful subject to her, especially from the lips of a child. For the first sew days after my arrival, we flattered ourselves, that Mrs. Mirvan was much better; but this enchanting illusion soon vanished. We had been one morning chatting on her evident amendment, and she told me, when able to support the fatigue of a journey, she would go to the south of France, and I should accompany her. She wished my mother to go; but that dear good woman, says she, can never leave your father for so long a time, (and his fortune being but small will not allow the whole family to take such a journey.) At dinner time, she eat the wing of a chicken, and seemed to cat with an appetite; after which she drank a glass of Madeira; and in a short time complaining of drowsiness, laid down on the sopha; my mother retired to her own room, and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to amuse myself. For some time, her sleep seemed composed, but she soon grew restless, breathed quick, and frequently started, every now and then fetching a deep sigh, which terminated in a kind of convulsive groan. I was alarmed and rang the bell, but before any one answered it, I perceived my beloved godmother was in strong convulsions; my shrieks brought the whole family to the room; a physician was sent for, but alas! nothing could be done. She was immediately put to bed; but never recovered her senses until a few moments before the final scene closed. In that short interval, she beckoned my mother towards her, and putting my hand in hers, thus addressed me, though with difficulty. “Meriel, you are the only comfort that dear suffering saint possesses; let mutual friendship cement the bonds of natural affection; my child never forsake your mother, so shall the father of mercies never forsake you.” I clasped my arms round my weeping parent, and articulated a vow to heaven, never to let her know a grief or pain, it was in my power to remove. My fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation, my life, every thing but integrity of heart, should be sacrificed to insure her felicity. “Enough, my child,” faintly cried Mrs. Mirvan, “the Creator of the universe has heard, and accepts your vow. Oh Meriel!” continued she, after a pause, “let it be thro' life ever present to your memory, that you must one day be as I am now, trembling on the verge of eternity. Love thy Maker above all things, and thy fellow creatures as thyself; 'tis that alone can support”.—She could articulate no more, but her lips still moved. She clasped her hands earnestly; raised her eyes toward those blissful regions to which her pure soul aspired, and with a placid smile sunk to eternal rest. “Oh!” said I, as I dropped on my knees by her bed side, “let me live a life of purity, that my death may be like hers.” Amen, amen, cried my mother, as the raised me from the ground. We retired to her apartment, where clasped in each others arms, we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the merits of our lost friend demanded. IN CONTINUATION. April 24th. I was so oppressed by the melancholy subject, that I could not for some time resume it. Pardon me, Celia, I do not mean to tritrifle with your friendly anxiety, I shall, therefore, pursue my narrative. When we had attended all that remained of the amiable Mrs. Mirvan to the grave; our family returned to Woodbine Cot. I do not speak of the conduct of my father during this melancholy period, because it could neither excite my veneration or your esteem. Mrs. Talbot conducted herself with great propriety, exerted herself to comfort and cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why that dear woman did not receive her attentions with that grateful sweetness, which she ever manifested to others. I think Mrs. Talbot a most engaging woman. She is not so handsome as my mother, but has a great deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made, and has a very expressive countenance, is affable, conciliating and extremely sensible; she is so kind as to assist and direct my studies. You know I am very fond of natural history. She frequently reads to me, and afterwards we saunter thro' the garden, fields and meadows in search of subjects to illustrate what we have read. In these rambles my mother accompanies us, but it grieves me to see such a settled melancholy impressed upon her countenance. My brother Richard yesterday came from school for a few days. I can percieve he is my father's favourite, indeed my mother is extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain I remark many unamiable traits appear evident in his disposition, tho' as yet he has seen but thirteen years, being three years younger than myself. His behaviour to me was very ungracious, when we were first introduced to each other. Tho' I had never seen him, yet as children of the same parents I felt my heart drawn toward him by an irresistable impulse. I therefore on hearing of his arrival, ran down stairs and was going to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but the frigid coldness that his countenance displayed repressed my ardour. He advanced, just touched my cheek and bowing profoundly, wished me joy of my fortune. “Joy! brother said I, indeed I have not thought of any thing but regret, for the sad occasion of my becoming mistress of this fortune; would to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were still alive to enjoy those few thousands, the acquisition of which cannot compensate to me for the loss of her valuable society.” “She was to be sure a good old woman,” said he, carelessly, “but you know sister, she was very infirm, so I think she is much happier out of the world than in it.” “Come, come Richard,” said my mother, with a look, half smiling, half frowning, “I must not hear you speak lightly of an event, which has so highly distressed us all.” Master Richard smiled contemptuously, turned on his heel, hummed a tune and walked out of the room. How happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman possessed of such an excellent heart, and such exquisite sensibility should be so very unfeeling; perhaps you will say he cannot resemble both parents; true, too true, it is a just remark; but oh how superiatively happy would be my lot if both those parents resembled each other. We live very retired, my father's income will not suffer him to associate with the higher class of inhabitants of the village, and his pride keeps him from those in the middling or lower walks of life. We are, therefore, visited by very few, nor among those few have I seen one, with whom my heart would claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, there must be women in the world, and young women too, who are different from any I have seen here. There are two families whom my mother is permitted to visit, and there are daughters in each family: but whenever we meet, which indeed is but seldom; they have so much to tell me concerning their lovers, their dresses and their petty differences with each other, that we have not a moment for rational conversation. By this account you will naturally suppose my time cannot pass in the most agreeable manner. I devote great part of my mornings to reading, drawing, music, and needle work, and had I but my Celia here I could be tolerably easy; though I can never be happy, while I see my mother oppressed with sorrow, which I can neither participate nor relieve. I have had little or no conversation with my father; as he still continues the same indifference towards me which I experienced at our first meeting. I shall continue to write to you my friend, tho' I can foresee my letters will contain but little variety: however it will be the means of keeping alive that friendship, which is to me so valuable, and a time may come when I shall be again happy in your society. Till then believe me in sincerity yours. MERIEL HOWARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. C LETTER II. MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM. May 2d. Meriel is returned from the continent, where she has been from a state of infancy immured in a gloomy convent. Mrs. Howard did not think her own family a proper place for the tuition of a girl. She was right: her husband is by no means a brilliant example, and I think, it would be a fortunate circumstance for young Howard was any thing to happen that might seperate him from his father. Meriel is not what is generally termed a fine girl; she is rather below the middle size, and inclined to en bon point; her face is not regularly pretty, but she has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through which you may read every emotion of her soul. She is fair, a fine glow of health animates her face, and a smile of good humour plays about her mouth; a luxuriant quantity of chesnut hair hangs in ringlets down her neck and shades a forehead that is ornamented with the most beautiful eye-brows I ever beheld. Yet she is not striking at first sight, indeed, you would rather be tempted to say she was plain, but the moment she speaks you must be charmed. I have heard women sing who have fine voices; but I would rather hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than listen to the finest singers in England. The melody of her voice, is so soft that she makes the meanest subject interesting; her countenance intelligent, her mind fraught with every gentle, generous virtue, but withall she is the pure child of nature. I could not have believed it possible for a girl of sixteen to be so artless and innocent. An entire stranger to deception, she seeks not to disguise one emotion of her heart. She loves neither her father nor her brother. I cannot blame her, their souls are not congenial with her own. Yet does she strive by respect and attention to attone for the deficiency. I am so charmed with this dear girl, who is a brilliant model of her mother's virtues; with this difference, Mrs. Howard's are passive virtues: Meriel's will prove active ones. I am so captivated with her gentle innocence that I find I can no longer remain in the family: Lucetta aid me to fly from infamy, from shame, from a black train of evils that I see ready to encompass me. You start, you do not understand; nor can I at present assume sufficient courage to explain my meaning. Oh! my sister, I am not worthy of your affection, I cannot pursue the subject. Adieu, I will write again soon. C. TALBOT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER III. MERIEL to CELIA. Woodbine Cot, May 3d, 1775. Celia, if you value your own happiness never desire to quit the convent. When I was there, I imagined my father a worthy character. Had I never left it, I had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a sad, sad thing to reflect on, but this man, whom nature, religion, every sacred tie obliges me to respect and love: this very man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came one Sunday morning into the library, where I was reading. “Well my pretty rose-bud,” said he, for he generally calls me by some such unaccountable name; “What are your studies?” “Rowe's letters,” I replied. “What do you read such stuff as that for?” cried he, pulling the book out of my hand, “ 'Tis time enough for you to read such serious nonsense some forty or fifty years hence, and here is that “stupid fellow Harvey too,” continued he, taking up a book that lay upon the table. “Why child, these ridiculous books are enough to turn your head; they might have done well enough in a convent, but surely you may find something more amusing in this collection.” “I read these serious authors by choice, sir,” said I. “You have a strange taste for a girl of your age then,” he replied, “but I don't believe you speak as you think. Come tell me honestly, Meriel,” continued he sitting, down beside me, “did you never get any novels or romances in the convent?” You may suppose I stared at him, for you know we never saw a book of the kind, during the whole time we were together; of this I assured him: to which he replied; “then that easily accounted for my taste.” He then began to speak of religion, and the sacred writings in a manner that made me tremble. At first, I thought he meant only to try me; but C 2 finding the more I opposed his sentiments, the stronger were the arguments he advanced to confute, as he said, “my foolish bigotry, to a subject which was not worthy the attention of any but old women and children.” I rose from my seat and bursting into tears, cried, “oh! sir, if these are indeed your sentiments they shock me to the soul.” “Come girl, come don't cry,” said he, pulling me toward him; “you must try to get the better of these superstitious notions, and learn to think and act for yourself, unbiased by the prejudices of others.” I could not answer for my tears. He took me in his arms and kissed me; but my soul shrunk back from his embrace. My mother just then passing the window, he left me and went into the garden to join her. I do not like this Mrs. Talbot, so well as I did at first; I saw my father take a liberty with her yesterday when they thought they were unobserved. There was an impropriety in it, which made me shudder; and a thought darted across my mind which almost stunned my faculties: surely they cannot be so very abandoned. Oh my poor mother! I fear, this too well explains the cause of your tears and dejection. May 5th. It is as I suspected, Mrs. Talbot is an unworthy woman. This morning, I arose earlier than common, intending, the weather being sine, to walk into the meadows, before breakfast, passing my mother's chamber door I saw it was partly open; and, looking in, I percieved my dear mother raised upon her elbow in the bed, the tears streaming down her face, and sobbing, as tho' her heart would break. Unable to restrain myself, I rushed into the room and ardently requested to know the cause of her grief. She hastily endeavoured to dry her tears and compose her countenance, assured me that nothing particular was the matter, but that she often was seized with those involuntary fits of weeping, for which she could assign no cause. “Oh! my dear mother,” said I, “you cannot thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do. Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs heavy at your heart, and preys upon your spirits. Can you, do you think your daughter unworthy to be trusted with your sorrows. Believe me I will treasure them in my bosom as a sacred deposit, and having eased your labouring breast of the painful burthen will pour into it the balm of consolation.” “My dear girl, my only comforter, said my mother; seek not to know what will only make you unhappy, I cannot be more so than I am already, said I, for how is it possible I can be at peace when you are the victim of concealed anguish? “Oh! my child, said she, I cannot explain to you the nature of my sorrows, without acusing one, whom it is your duty to respect, I must not make my child dispise her father;” “I will not despise him, I replied. If he can injure goodness like your's I will pity and pardon him, and pray to heaven to turn his heart.” But where is my father. He has been out all night said my mother. While you were at Mr. Rowley's yesterday, he went out and has not returned since. Just then I heard a chaise drive up to the door and looking out saw my father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the mystery is unravelled said I; “go, said my mother, dry your eyes and appear at breakfast as composed as you can; do not let them have the triumph of seeing how much they distress us. I did as I was desired, but when I entered the breakfast parlour, I felt a glow of indignation flush my cheek, and I could hardly give them the compliments of the morning with any steadiness of accent. Mrs. Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes upon my face; I darted at her a look of anger, she immediately cast them down, turned pale and seemed much agitated; but whether it was with anger or sensibility I cannot determine. May 6th, 1775. This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman: her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her character undefinable. With some of the finest sentiments that can elevate human nature, and with the power to act up to those sentiments, she has sunk herself upon a level the meanest of her sex. I at one and the same moment admire, love, pity and dispise her: but I will inform you of the cause of these contradictory sentiments. Yesterday afternoon as my mother, Mrs. Talbot and myself were at tea, my father came in from a walk and throwing a folded paper into Mrs. Talbot's lap, told her he had met with a travelling pedlar and had brought her a present. She unfolded the paper, and seeing a piece of fine chintz, enquired if there was enough for two gowns. “No,” said my father, “I bought but one.” “Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it for me; only your politeness leads you to offer it; permit me to resign it to the proper owner,” laying it on my mother's knee. “Then, you refuse my present, Kate,” said my father sternly. “I do indeed,” says she, with firmness, “and am resolved on no account whatever to accept another obligation at your hands. I have too long forgot what was due to this respectable family, to your honour, and to myself. It is time to amend and fly from errors, which originated in duplicity on one side, and weakness on the other. I have wrote to my sister, that I shall leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and nothing shall prevent my putting my design in execution.” During the time Mrs. Talbot was speaking, my father stood like one petrefied; my mother's colour went and came alternately red and pale. Indeed I was afraid she would have fainted. At length she assumed sufficient courage to ask with tolerable composure, how long she had formed this resolution, which appeared as sudden as it was unexpected. “Oh! my dear madam,” said she, “it is not a sudden resolution, I have long had it in my mind, but always wanted fortitude to execute my resolves; it is much easier to rush into guilt, than to recede from it, and I have long learnt to detest my own vices without making one attempt to eradicate them. This dear young lady has compleated a reformation, which your gentleness and virtue had begun. Believe me, madam, had I sooner known, how very amiable you were, I should never have injured you; but I was a stranger to your goodness till it was too late to recall my error. When Miss Howard returned from France, it was impossible to be an inmate in the house with her and not love her. From loving virtue in others we by degrees wish to possess it ourselves; because we are conscious that without it we cannot be respected or esteemed by the worthy part of mankind. I wished to obtain Miss Howard's friendship; but I knew I was unworthy of the blessing. From that moment I determined, if I could not merit her esteem, I would at least avoid her displeasure and contempt; but alas!” continued she, “I am too late; she already despises me, and I feel I have not even a claim to her pity.” “For heaven's sake! what does all this mean,” said my father, “who dares treat you with contempt, or insult you with their pity?” “No one, Mr. Howard,” she replied calmly; “I only say it is what I have a right to expect; if you remember I told you a few days since that I was determined no longer to lead a life of infamy; you thought me then in jest; perhaps you may think so still; believe me, 'tis of little consequence to me, what opinion you may form of my conduct; I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of these ladies, of whose merits I could wish you to be sensible, before you have inevitably destroyed both their happiness and your own.” She then rose from her seat, and taking one of my mother's hands, and one of mine, pressed them alternately to her lips, and bursting into a fresh flood of tears, left the room. My father followed her, and I heard them speak very high in the adjoining apartment, but could distinguish nothing that past excepting the words, “never whilst I have life,” which were pronounced by Mrs. Talbot, as she went up stairs, where she locked herself into her own room. My father went immediately out, nor was he returned while I sat up with my mother, who seemed more melancholy than ever, and not inclined for conversation. This morning when we met at breakfast a heavy cloud hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was not come down. I went up to call her. The door was open. I went into the room; but found, by a letter which lay on the table, that she had left the house at four o'clock in the morning. The cloaths and other presents, which she had received from my father, were packed up in a small trunk and directed for me. In her letter to my mother, she takes a long adieu, and says there is not the least probability of our ever meeting again, as she should leave England almost immediately. It is impossible to describe the rage of my father, when he found she was really gone. He swore we had treated her ill, or she never would have taken such a resolution. In vain we protested our innocence. He vented his rage in the most ungentleman-like terms, on my dear patient mother, who could return nothing but tears. He is now taking his usual walk. I hope, when he returns, he will be calmer. I am weary, my dear Celia, and can write no more. Farewell. May good angels guard you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IV. MRS. TALBOT to LUCETTA ASKHAM. Woodbine Cot, May 5th, 1775. I found myself at the conclusion of my last letter, my dear sister, totally unable to continue the subject, which I just hinted to you. I wished you to conceive the whole without descending to particulars, yet how is that possible. At this moment you think me a Vol. I. D virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you also think Mr. Howard the most benevolent, most disintersted of men: ah! my dear sister, how have you been deceived. But to make you understand more perfectly, I must go back to the time when I lost Mr. Talbot. A stranger in London, alone unconnected with the world, deprived of the means of support by my husband's death. I was revolving in my mind what plan to pursue in future; when chance introduced me to Mr. Howard. My dress declared me a widow. He paid me innumerable little attentions, whenever we met at the house of an attorney, with whose lady I was intimate, and at length from having frequently called with my friend, who was employed to settle my late husband's affairs, he assumed the privilege of visiting by himself. To you, who know him so well, I need not describe either the graces of his person, or his insinuating address. Perfect master of the art of deception; he conceals under the mask of integrity and honour every vice which can disgrace human nature: with that versatality of temper which makes him appear every thing to every body; with the religious he is grave and solemn; with the gay cheerful and affable, with the splenetic he can rail at the vices and follies of mankind, and with the libertine practice those vices himself: tho' where it is his interest he can appear devout, yet no man ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion of religion, or strove with more diabolical earnestness to corrupt the young and inexperienced heart. When first I was introduced to him, I was told he was a married man. What was my wonder, then, when after a few visits he professed a passion for me. I combated his sophistical arguments as well as my weak reasoning would permit; but alas! I lost ground in every argument. At length he told me as a secret, which nothing but the most violent passion could have extorted from him, that he never did, nor ever could love his wife; that he had married her solely to oblige his father, who was since dead, and that she was a cold, inanimate woman, fit only for the frigid rules, and solemn rites of a convent. Then with the most solemn affeverations, he called heaven to witness that I was the only woman he ever loved; and called down the most heavy maledictions on his head, if he should ever forsake me. Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him the tenderest, best of men, and mourn'd a fate which had united him to a woman he could not love. Poverty and distress surrounded me. Mr. Howard offered a settlement of fifty pounds a year and to take me into his family, as a relation of his own. My sister, do you now concieve the depth of my shame. I accepted his offer, and a letter was dispatched, to let Mrs. Howard know, he had met with a relation, whose circumstances were rather embarrassed and whom he had invited home, as he thought she would prove an agreeable addition to their family. The return of post brought such an answer as might be expected from a woman, whose chief study was to please and render her husband happy. When I arrived at Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me with a mixture of politeness and affection. Never shall I forget the sensations, which pervaded my bosom, when entering a neat parlour she rose to welcome me. Astonishment riveted me to the spot; unable to speak or move, I sunk into the nearest chair, and had nearly fainted. Figure to yourself, my sister, a woman, scarcely thirty years old, elegantly formed, with a countenance animated and prepossessing; her fine blue eyes beaming tenderness on the cruel betrayer of her peace. Think you hear her in accents soft as the music of the spheres, by turns cheering and comforting the very woman who had robbed her of her husband's affections. And surely then, you will not wonder, if unable to stifle my emotions, I gave way to a flood of tears. “You are too much affected, my dear madam,” said Mrs. Howard, taking my hand. “Do not I beseech you give way to immoderate grief: when misfortunes are irremidiable it is our duty to submit without repining: but I flatter myself, the united attentions of my dear Mr. Howard, and myself, will by degrees restore your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope you will consider yourself at home, and be assured, we shall think ourselves happy in being able in the least to contribute to your ease or felicity.” She then led me to an appartment, which had been prepared for me, and left me, to that repose which conscious guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying. The more I knew of this amiable woman, the greater cause I found for admiration and respect. She being naturally of an open disposition, I was in the course of our intimacy, made acquainted with the most material circumstances of her life: and from her I learnt that she had brought a very handsome fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they had married contrary to the advice of their friends on both sides, as they had formed different views for them: but, said she, with a sigh, “We thought love for each other would compensate for the privation of the society of our other friends.” D 2 I had not been long in this family, before I discovered, that I was not the only woman, who shared Mr. Howard's attention. He was neither careful to avoid suspicion, nor delicate in the choice of his companions, as almost every female servant in the family, who was not proof against flattering vows and presents of finery, had at some time or other attracted her master's notice. The amiable suffering wife bore all with angelic patience, nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had the satisfaction to find that my remonstrances had some effect, and he became more circumspect in his behaviour. I could also at any time restrain him from the pursuit of any new amour by threatning to leave him, and I flattered myself, that this in some measure attoned to Mrs. Howard for the injuries I did her. In this manner I continued in the family near three years, when I found an evident alteration in the conduct of my hostess. Her manner was cold and distant; she often avoided my society and retired to her apartment, where I have surprized her weeping. Conscious guilt would not permit me to enquire the cause of her uneasiness, as I naturally imagined she had discovered my improper intimacy with her husband: but one day while we were at Bristol, I overheard a conversation between them which determined me to quit a life, at once so repugnant to honour, humanity and religion. It was one morning, as I was preparing to enter the breakfast room, the door of which was not quite shut, when I heard Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his wife for not behaving so kindly as formerly to me. I wished to know in what manner Mrs. Howard spoke of me, and therefore descended to the meanness of listening. “My dear, Mr. Howard,” said she, “how is it possible for me to behave with cordiality to a woman who I am well convinced has usurped my place in your affections; and tho' I am willing acknowledge the many amiable traits in her character, I cannot be blind to that one error, which embitters every hour of my life; nor am I mistress of sufficient dissimulation, to wear the face of friendship where my heart feels only dislike, nay almost disgust. I will not scruple to confess, I once did esteem her: but pardon the expression, if I say, the heart that loves virtue for its own sake, can never form acquaintance with vice. We may pity, but we must despise.” “Hold madam,” said he, “or I shall be led to suppose you despise me.” “No, Mr. Howard,” said she, with a firm animated voice, “you are the chosen friend of my heart, the father of my children, the husband of my affections, I have promised to love, to honour, and obey you, and heaven is my witness, I never have failed in one of those points: to cease to love you is impossible; to obey you is the pleasure of my life: but, pardon me, if your own conduct has forced me unwillingly to own, I can no longer honour you; my peace has been broken by your ill humour, my fortune dissipated by your extravagance, nay lavished on the most disolute of my sex, until your family is reduced to the most mortifying circumstances: my child, my beloved Meriel obliged to be educated far from me; because her father's morals were too vitiated to be a proper object for the contemplation of a young and innocent mind.” Here she wept, and Mr. Howard not being able to make a just defence, flew into a violent passion, as was his usual custom, swore she was a most unacountabIe woman, and wondered at his own patience in bearing with her so long. This undeserved reproach awakened her stifled passion, and she answered with intrepidity. “No, sir, it is my patience is to be wondered at, but do not irritate me, beyond the possibility of submitting any longer, I fear I have been wrong in so long bearing my injuries in silence; perhaps, you think, because I appeared blind to your immoral conduct, I countenanced it. Let me undeceive you. Mrs. Talbot should not so long have remained under the same roof with me, had I not feared, that by depriving her of an asylum, I should injure her reputation and drive her into an inhuman world, where one false step is never forgiven, and she might have sunk into the lowest abyss of vice and infamy. I flattered myself my gentleness might have reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the inconstancy of your nature, and had determined that when forsaken by you, she should not want a friend to snatch her from everlasting ruin.” I was so overcome by this generous declaration, that I was forced to catch hold of the ballustrade of the stairs, to prevent falling. A sudden sickness came over me, and I could not distinctly hear the remainder of their conversation; but, thank heaven, I profited so much from what I had heard, that I resolved no longer, by my presence, to wound a heart so replete with benevolence toward me. I did not enter the parlour; but returned to my own apartment; and, sending an apology for not appearing at breakfast, revolved in my own mind a variety of schemes, for my future subsistence; but could think on nothing that appeared in the least probable of success. That afternoon Miss Howard arrived from France. Had my mind been ever so depraved it must have returned to virtue after an acquaintance with this dear girl; I therefore became more firm in my resolves; and having formed an acquaintance with an elderly lady, of whose sense and goodness of heart I had a very high opinion; I determined to disclose every particular of my situation to her, and ask her advice in what manner I should proceed. She heard me with attention, and was friendly enough not to attempt to paliate my errors. She placed my conduct in a proper light and encouraged the remorse which was already awakened in my bosom. She then opened a scene of comfort to my distressed imagination, and having advised me to return with the family to Woodbine Cot, to prevent any ill natured remarks among our acquaintance, and afterwards to pursue the plan which she had laid down. Yet, will you believe it, when I returned to this place I felt my resolution slacken, and found I was relapsing into my former errors; but this morning the dear amiable Meriel has awakened my sleeping conscience, and I am determined to leave the family immediately. I went into the garden after breakfast and found her weeping in a little arbour. “In tears, my dear little girl,” said I. “Have I not cause for tears,” she replied, “is not my beloved mother unhappy?” “Unhappy!” said I, with an accent of surprise, willing to try if she was acquainted with the cause. She fixed her expressive eyes on my face, and replied emphatically; “surely I need not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that she is very unhappy; for you profess yourself her friend, and friendship is quick sighted in discerning the sorrows of the person esteemed: true friendship is also eagerly anxious to remove the cause of grief from the bosom of those they love, though by so doing, they plant a thorn in their own.” I could not answer her; I did not even attempt it; but pressing her hand in silence retired to another part of the garden. On Tuesday morning, at four o'clock, I shall expect you will send a man and horse for me. I shall come but poorly provided with cash, as I am resolved to leave my settlement behind me, as likewise every present of value, which I have received. I will not impoverish the family which I have already irreparably injured. But do not think I shall come to throw myself on you for support. No, my sister, I have the abilities necessary to earn my subsistence, and they shall be exerted. I shall stay only one night with you, and then proceed to my kind friend at Bristol. As to the remainder of my plan, if I succeed to my wish, you shall again hear from me; if not, I shall sink at once into total oblivion. Farewell, my sister, forget my errors; remember only my penitence, and let me share your prayers, that it may be sincere and lasting. C. TALBOT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER V. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. Woodbine Cot, May 7th, 1775. My father is more composed, than I could imagine possible in the absence of Mrs. Talbot; but he is still gloomy and unsocial with my mother; however, I cannot but flatter myself that time, and her unwearied assiduities, will regain his affections; and was that to be the happy result of her patience and forbearance, how great would be our felicity. Miss Dolly Pringle has just called to solicit my mother's leave for my drinking tea with her. It is but seldom I am permitted to go without the boundaries of our garden, except to accompany my father or mother in a retired walk; but for a wonder, I am this afternoon to be trusted unaccompanied by either. I cannot think what my father is afraid of, that he should be so averse to Vol. I. E my taking any kind of innocent recreation. I am sure, if I know my own heart, I have no improper wishes lurking there; yet he is always saying such strange things about love and lovers that it seems he would be angry if a man was only to speak civil to me. Dolly knew this odd way of his, and so did not tell him that her brother was expected to come from London for a few days, and most likely would arrive this afternoon. “I am sure,” said she to me, “you will like Harry vastly, and if he is not smitten, I shall be surprised. Pray Miss,” continued she, “were you never in love?” “In love,” said I; “really I don't rightly comprehend what you mean by the word.” “La! that is vastly odd; but never mind my dear; half an hour's conversation with my brother will explain it better than I could in a whole day.” “But why Miss Pringle, must your brother talk to me of love; I should suppose there were many more interesting subjects.” “La! Miss,” she replied something tartly, “you talk like a child I think; why what should a gallant young man say to a beautiful young lady, but that he adored her; or when did you ever read of a young gentleman being left to entertain a lady, for half an hour, but he fell at her feet, called her a divinity, and vowed to love her while the vital fluid warmed his heart.” “Bless me!” said I, “I declare I never read such a thing in my life.” “Surely then,” she replied with a look of surprise; “you never read the divine history of lady Frances and lady Caroline, or the loves of Edward and Harriet?” “No, indeed,” said I, “I have never even heard of them.” “Oh! my dear girl, then,” cried she, in a sort of extasy; “you have a pleasure to come, of which at present you can form no idea: I will lend you the books; but you must not let your father see them.” And that you may believe me Celia, I shall not; for he is always ready enough to abridge me of any thing that can afford me pleasure. As to my dear mother, I am sure she will gratify every laudable wish of my heart; and sure if Miss Pringle has recieved so much pleasure in the perusal of them, they cannot be improper books; at any rate, when one hears a great deal about a thing, one naturally longs to see it. But after all it appears to me very odd that a man and woman cannot converse together without making love: I think it is a very foolish idea, and in my opinion a very fallacious one; for now I remember, Mr. Verdome travelled all the way from Bologne with me, and never said a syllable about love or adoration. To be sure Mr. Verdome is almost fifty years old; but I should not suppose that would make any great difference. May 8th. Well, to be sure I do begin to be a little better pleased with the society of our neighbours than I was at first; indeed I feel my heart much lighter since Mrs. Talbot left us, for I see my dear mother looks happier; and if she is happy I shall be so too. I spent a very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's, whose son arrived, just as we had sat down to tea; I thought him a very pleasing young man. He is an ensign in the army, and has a military, manly countenance. I know not how it was, but whether from what Dolly had said in the morning, or whether from my not being accustomed to the society of men; yet I felt myself awkward and embarressed; however, as Mr. Pringle did not say any thing particular, I soon recovered myself, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and her daughter left the room for a few moments, I was frightened to death left he should make love to me, and you know, if he had I should not have known what to say to him. This fear, I am sure, made me look like a fool; for I felt my face glow like scarlet. I dare say he thought me an idiot: well, it is of little consequence to me what he thought: only you know one don't like strangers to form an unjust opinion of our mental faculties. Miss Pringle lent me the books which she promised: I did not dare to read any before I went to bed, as my father often walks round the house to see if all the lights are out; and if he had caught me reading, he would have immediately taken the books from me, for he has lately taken it into his head that I read too much, and that I shall be good for nothing, if I am suffered to pore so much over a parcel of musty old authors. So, I locked up my new acquisitions in my closet, and arose two hours earlier this morning to peruse it. Realy, Celia, these young ladies who write so much, and so prettily to each other, must be very amiable and lovely, for you must know the whole book is in letters, it is indeed a charming E 2 history; you cannot think how much I cried whilst I was reading. Surely, said I, at one time, it must be a sad thing to be in love; and yet unhappy as it makes many, every body seems to be affected with this strange passion; it appears to be their whole business. But my father is gone to walk and my mother retired to her apartment, which she does almost every afternoon; so, I may now snatch an hour or two to read a little more. May 9th. Well, Celia, would you believe it, after having cried myself almost blind about the the distresses of the dear ladies, whose history I have been reading, I was agreeably surprised to find, in the end, all parties were made happy. I declare I was very much delighted, and cannot say but I should like to go into more company, and see a little more of life; for then perhaps I should meet with some such charming women as lady Frances and lady Caroline. Celia, I might also be admired by some fine gentleman, as they were; for I find country girls are as much engaged with love and lovers as the great ladies. I wish I could convey these books to you, or that you could get some just like them. Perhaps these were the kind my father meant, when he talked about romances and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this is a real history, the characters drawn from life. Miss Pringle has promised to lend me some more of the same sort, and some plays; so I think I shall pass my time much more agreeably than before; tho' do not think I mean to neglect those authors our dear sister Constance so strenuously recommended to my notice. No, no, my friend, I will not neglect the useful studies of history, geography, and far more necessary duty of public and private devotion; and now I am on the subject of devotion, I must just mention something in my father's character, which is to me unaccountable. Tho' he talked to me in the prosane stile I have related in a former letter, yet to my mother and the families who visit us, he pretends to have a high veneration for religion and religious subjects, and as we live a considerable distance from the church, he makes a practice of reading the morning service to the family; tho' perhaps the moment he has closed the prayer book, should the most trisling thing happen to ruffle his temper, he will burst into fits of ungovernable rage, and swear in such a horrible manner, that I shudder to hear him. There is a little boy, whom he has taken into the family, and whom he takes great pains to teach his catechism, &amp;c. I have seen him whip the poor lad unmercifully for innocently humming a song tune on a Sunday morning, when he himself lives in the constant breach of almost every duty the christian religion lays days down for our observation and direction. Are not these inconsistencies, Celia? Surely the father of children, the master of a family, should set a good example, or he can never expect others to attend to duties he so evidently appears to disregard. My dear old nurse, Deborah, arrived yesterday, from a visit she has been paying her friends ever since our return from the continent. She enquired when I had heard from you; desires you will not forget her. Of this I assured her, she need not be afraid. Her return is another source of comfort to me, as my mother says she shall continue in the family as long as she pleases, and you know the affection I have contracted for her, from her attendance on me the whole time I was abroad, indeed I consider her almost in a maternal light, her fidelity and attachment to our family has been ever unshaken. Miss Pringle called this afternoon, and we walked in the garden together near an hour, during which time she told me her brother was greatly struck with my person, and that he had told his mother, if he thought I would return his passion, he should immediately relinquish the idea he had formed of marrying a woman, to whom the whole family had the greatest dislike, as she was ignorant, low born and without fortune. “How happy shall I be my dear Miss Howard,” said she, “to call you sister.” “Bless me,” said I, “how can you talk so, you know I must not think of listening to a lover without my father's permission.” “Your father indeed,” cried she laughing, “I wonder what your dear little simple head will fancy next: why child, he would forbid me the house if he only suspected such a thing; and you know my dear Meriel,” (she continned in a soft soothing accent) “you know, we are bosom friends and sworn sisters and it would be very hard, you know, to be separated, perhaps forever.” “Indeed Miss Pringle,” said I, “my heart feels grateful for the friendship you profess for me, and I should be very sorry to be deprived of your society.” “Well, then my dear,” said she, “take this letter and don't let either your father or your mother see it.” I would have refused the letter, as I feared it would be improper to take it; but my father just then entering the garden, I dreaded his anger which is awakened at the most insignisicant trifles, and is always impetuous: so I hastily put it in my pocket. When we returned to the house and Miss Pringle was gone, he cried pettishly to my mother; “what does that girl do so often here? I shall have Meriel spoiled by her nonsensical chatter; besides I will lay a guinea there is an intrigue of some sort contriving between them; I never knew two girls allowed to be so much together but they hatched mischief.” “If you do not like Dolly Pringle,” replied my mother, “we will try to drop her acquaintance, but you must consider, Mr. Howard, Meriel must have some society.” “Why, pray what society would she have,” said he, “are not you always with her, and has she not plenty of needle-work to do? let her stick close to that, and she won't want to be gadding and gossiping: she is at present a stranger to the world, and the less she knows of it the better.” This unkindness does not grieve me as it would if I loved him; but it gives me pain to see how much it affects my mother. I sat down to supper in silence, and when it was finished, retired as usual to my own room, where I haistily broke the seal of my letter, and found it wrote in such a charming style, so tender, so lively, I read it over half a dozen times, but could not determine whether to answer it or not. Good night Celia, it is eleven o'clock, and I dare not write a moment longer. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VI. MERIEL HOWARD to CELIA SHELBURNE. Woodbine Cot, June 17th. I have been very unhappy, Celia, since I wrote last; indeed I did not know whether I should be permitted to write to you again: nor could I now enjoy that satisfaction if good Deborah had not procured me pens, ink, and some paper; which she did on conditions of seeing all I wrote; and I have left my bed at the early hour of four, to pour forth my complaints to my dear Celia. In my last I told you I had recieved a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring himself my lover: I will own I was very much pleased with it. Tho' at first I hesitated to answer it, yet, when I read a few more books, which Miss Dolly Pringle sent me by means of our dairy maid, and I found that none of the young ladies mentioned in them ever hesitated at answering their lover's letters; I ventured to write a few lines in reply to one which he sent me requesting me to meet him one night after the family were in bed, and in which he told me, Lettice the maid would come and let me know, when all was quiet in the house, and that she would go with me to the place he had appointed for our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think any harm; so I wrote and told him if his sister would come with him, I would meet him, for I wished very much to see Dolly, and I knew I should not have another opportunity very soon. When we met, his manner was so tender, his language so pathetic, and the tender attentions of his sister so like what I had read, that I could not help confessing that I pitied him, and that if it would in the least alleviate his suffering, I would meet him there again. We went on thus for some time, when overpowered one evening by his entreaties, I consented to go with him to London, where he promised to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I tremble even now, when I think of what followed. The next day we had just done breakfast, when an elderly gentleman who has a great regard for my father and mother called, and telling the latter he had something very particular to say to her, they walked together into the garden. When they returned, I saw my dear mother, oh! I shall never forget it, I saw her look extremely angry, her eyes darted at me such indignant glances, that my very soul felt humbled within me, I could have fallen at her feet and intreated to know the cause of her anger: for indeed, Celia, I did not think, if she had even discovered my correspondence with young Pringle, that she would have been so very much offended, especially as I could appeal for a precedent, to the conduct of so many amiable young ladies of even rank and fortune. But the moment Mr. Sutten was gone, she asked me in a tone that rent my very heart, how I dared either to receive or write letters without her knowledge. Her anger overpowered me; something rose in my throat and prevented my speaking, I thought I should have died with sorrow, when she thus continued: “Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to abuse Vol. I. F the confidence your mother had placed in you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared to violate the laws of female delicacy, by openly avowing a passion for a man to whom you are almost a stranger, and even to make yourself ridiculous by writing such letters to him as renders you the jest of the whole village.” “Oh! my dear mother,” said I in a voice almost choaked with sobs; “indeed I did not think any harm.” “Perhaps, Meriel,” said she, “had you stopped here, I might have forgiven you: but know, false disembling girl, I have discovered all your illicit plans, you have left your father's house at hours, when modesty would have shrunk to venture out, without a proper protector: and, to compleat your imprudence, this very night you had designed to quit a mother, whom you have pretended to love and respect, and to throw yourself intirely into the power of a wretch, who regards you only as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the possession of your fortune.” I fell at her feet and would have taken her hand; but she snatched it from me, and and rising from her seat left me weeping on the ground. “Unworthy girl,” said she, as she left the room, “go hide yourself from my sight, for you are become odious to me. Never, never, child, can you regain the confidence you have lost. I had flattered myself with finding in you a comforter and tender filial friend; but you have added another wound to a heart already lacerated by many forrows.” When my mother was gone, I laid my head upon a chair and continued weeping. In this position my father found me. “So, Miss,” said he, sternly, “I find you were for providing a husband for yourself; you were resolved to lose no time; but pray what will you say when I tell you this fine lover of your's is already married and has been so these two years.” “Married, sir!” cried I, raising my head. “Yes child, married, though his friends were unacquainted with it, but this morning I hear his wife is arrived from London, with one child, to solicit that support which he has inhumanly refused her.” I made no answer, but returning my head to its reclining posture, continued weeping without intermission. “Ah! my poor little Meriel,” said he, in a tone of voice more soft than usual, “I am afraid this naughty man has made great havock with your heart; but, come, come, you shall not wear the willow long, we will find another lover for you soon.” “Indeed, sir, you mistake the cause of my tears,” said I. “It is not the loss of all the lovers in the world would grieve me half so much as the fear of having forever forfeited my dear mother's affection.” “Well, well,” he replied, “don't let that vex you; if she is unkind, I will endeavour to attone for it. To be sure, she is very rigid in her notions, but I dare say, when she sees you heartily repent your fault, she will overlook it and love you as well as ever.” He then left me, and I retired to my apartment, where Deborah told me my mother had been, and had carried all my pens, ink and paper away with her. Ever since she has been cold, distant, nay almost unkind. Oh! my dear friend, what shall I do to regain her affection, and convince her my repentance is sincere. Indeed, she is to me the dearest object upon earth, and her happiness shall henceforth be my only study. My father, when my mother is present, treats me with equal rigour; but, when we are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice he has come to my apartment when she was out, and even brought me some books; among which were some French novels. Even my brother has heard of my imprudence, and has wrote to my mother, enquiring the truth of the report; but he does not write as if he wished it false. I do not think he loves me; he had expected a legacy from Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune being left to me, has created envy and jealousy in a bosom, which I had once flattered myself I should find warm with friendly and fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but know my heart, he would see he had no cause to envy me, except he should envy those delightful sensations which I shall feel when I come to the possession of my fortune, in saying, brother, it is equally your's, command it to its utmost extent. Deborah has promised me to get this letter conveyed to the nearest post town. When you write, direct under cover to Mrs. Deborah Ellis, to remain at the office till called for, I dare not let my mother know I correspond with any one, least she should discover by what means I got the materials for writing, and poor Deborah would suffer for her affectionate indulgence. I have no employment, no amusement, half so agreeable as F 2 scribling to my Celia, so do not be impatient at the length of my letters. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VII. DEBORAH ELLIS to CELIA SHELBURNE. Woodbine Cot, July 24th, 1775. DEAR MISS, I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom in a poor old woman, who is almost broken hearted, at an accident which has distracted the whole family. I hardly know how to tell you, because I know you loved and valued my dear young lady; and so indeed must every one who knew her merits, tho' since she has returned from France, I have heard her ridiculed for virtues which few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and have seen her drawn into errors, by those who, envying the superior qualities of her heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a level with themselves. She shewed me the last letter she wrote to you; for it was only on condition of seeing all she wrote, that I supplied her with the means of following her favourite amusement. The sternness of her mother still continued; and the poor young lady was abridged of the pleasure of even walking beyond the limits of her father's garden. Mr. Howard's conduct, towards the dear girl, was altogether unaccountable, sometimes harsh, unfeelingly reproaching her for her intended error; a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no means calculated to lead her to renounce the attachment, which hurried her to so improper a step. At other times, he turned the whole affair into ridicule, and conversed with his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but tho' she trembled at his anger, she never expressed any satisfaction in his company when good humoured; but rather wished to indulge in solitude and study. About ten days since my mistress was sent for, into Effex, to a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr. Howard did not accompany her: she set off in the afternoon, and he having procured a chaise took Miss Meriel out for a ride, an indulgence she had never experienced since her residence at this place. When she returned she seemed very melancholy, and said her spirits were much oppressed, and her mind harrassed with terrors, for which she could by no means account. She supped with her father and retired at her usual hour. Mr. Howard sat up much later than common, and to my great surprise, when I carried in his candle, he seemed intoxicated, tho' he had been alone and seldom gave way to excessive drinking, unless he had been led into it by company. I heard him go into his apartment, and then went to bed myself, where the fatigue of the day soon made me fall asleep. About two o'clock I was awakened by Miss. Howard, who in a shivering voice asked me if I had not heard a noise in her chamber, said, she was greatly frightened, and would, if I pleased, stay the remainder of the night with me. I helped her into bed; she was cold as death, trembled excessivly, and soonfell into a convulsive hysteric fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up one of my fellow servants, and by repeated applications of hartshorn, vinegar, &amp;c. brought her to herself; she would give no account of the cause of her fright; but seemed to mourn some heavy misfortune, and repeatedly wished herself with you in the convent again. She rested but little all night, and the next morning was so indisposed as to be unable to rise, and was confined to her room for several succeeding days. One day after she had ventured down stairs; I asked leave to go a few miles, on some particular business, where I was detained all night, by reason of a violent storm. Rising early in the morning, and walking home before any of the family but the house maids was stirring, I went up immediately to see how my dear Miss Meriel was, for I had been very uneasy about her all night, knowing she was terrified at thunder, and would not dare to express her fears to her father, who would only have ridiculed them. On entering the room I was alarmed to find the bed in great disorder; many of her cloaths laying about the floor, the window open, and my beloved Miss Howard gone. Observing the sheets fastened to the bed-post, I naturally imagined she must have slid by them into the garden, and looking out at the window I saw one of her shoes lay on the ground. Convinced now, of what before I had only conjectured, I gave a scream of terror which alarmed my master, who came half dressed, pale and trembling into the room, exclaiming, “for God's sake what is the noise about.” “My young lady, sir,” said I, pointing to the window. “Eloped,” said he, “with that villain, Pringle; but here I sware never again to suffer”—“Oh, sir!” cried I eagerly, “do not sware to renounce her; I'd venture my life upon her innocence; I am sure some vile means have been used to draw her thus from her duty.” “She is a little hypocrite, nurse,” said he, “and will make herself friends wherever she goes, till she is found out. I suppose she will trump up some fine story about ill usage, or some devilish thing or other. I wish to my soul she had never left the convent; this will go near to break her mother's heart.” About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is impossible to describe her anguish when informed of her daughter's absence (I will not say elopement) because I am sure, if the truth was known, it would not deserve so harsh an appellation. She sent immediately to Mrs. Pringle's, where she heard that the young gentleman went away, as he said, to join his regiment the afternoon before. Thus does this unlucky circumstance tend to make it universally believed, that Miss Howard and Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed Miss, I do not think that is the case; for, certain I am, that a purer heart never inhabited a human bosom, and that she never would have thought of eloping with a married man: besides, I am convinced she was not greatly attached to him. He was the first man who had ever addressed her; she is the pure child of undisguised nature, and being pleased with his attentions which had the charm of novelty to recommend them; she fancied herself in love; but after her conduct had been placed in a proper light, by her mother, she seemed perfectly convinced of her error, and often used to say, she wondered how she could imagine she loved a man, of whom she knew so little. “I should think, nurse,” said she one day, “that this unfortunate affair in the end would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will make me, in future, distrust the emotions of my heart, and be upon my guard against its deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably injured me in the opinion of my mother; but I must endeavour, by my future conduct, to regain her confidence, and in the mean time, submit with patience to that displeasure I am certain I have in a great measure deserved.” Such sentiments as these, madam, do not argue a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my sweet Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as an angel. Three days are now elapsed since her departure, during which time no tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh! Miss, I fear we shall never see the dear creature again: some dreadful mystery is certainly concealed by her thus abruptly leaving her father's house. Would to heaven I had the means of clearing it up, and at the same time removing the cloud which at present obscures the reputation of the most innocent young lady that ever existed. I will not finish this letter till to-morrow. If we hear no tidings then, I shall give her up as lost forever. July 25th. I just snatch up my pen to inform you, dear Miss, that Miss Howard is found, and is at present in her father's house; but in such a situation that we have little hope of her ever recovering her senses sufficient to give any regular account of the cause of her flight, of this we are certain, she was not with Mr. Pringle. July 28th. I am now sitting by my poor young lady's bed side, who is just fallen into a sweet refreshing sleep, and shall seize this opportunity to inform you, in what manner she was discovered and conducted home. A farmer who lives about five miles from hence, at the skirt of a wood, having occasion for his horse to be brought from pasture early in the morning, ordered a lad who lived as a servant with him, to go by four o'clock and fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and when he returned he declared he had been frightened almost to death by an apparition of a woman, dressed all in white, whom he saw sitting at the foot of a tree as he went; that he heard her sigh and groan, and said he supposed it was the spirit of Fanny Summers, who hung herself there last autumn, and he was the more positive of this, as at his return, he saw her walking too and fro with a child in her arms and heard her talk to it. The farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode away without paying any farther attention to it, but a young gentleman who has a lodgings at the farmers, on account of an ill state of health, having over heard the boy's story, determined to rise immediately and go to the wood to investigate the matter farther, as he supposed it might be some unfortunate human creature, rather than a supernatural being; and determined, if in his power, to rescue her from misery, and, what appeared more than probable, a horrid and untimely end. He had not penetrated far into the wood before he discovered, at the foot of an old oak, a female form stretched on the ground, and by her side a little spaniel, whose head lay on the woman's arm, and who at frequent intervals seemed to make most pitious moans. He approached and found the unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently raised her from the ground, supporting her in his arms whilst he whilst her temples with Vol. I. G volatiles, which, on account of his own weak constitution, he always carried in his pocket. While he was thus employed, the dog fawned upon him licked his hand and shewed every token of gratitude in his power; at length the lady began to move, and her preserver hearing the voices of labourers passing through the wood, hallowed to them for assistance. When they came near, the dog flew from his mistress to one of them, leaping, bounding and howling for joy. What Lubin, said the clown, how come you here, then drawing nearer to help support the lady; he started back and cried, body o'me, 'tis Miss Meriel, poor dear soul, how could she get here, as sure as any thing she has been robbed and murdered. Almost smiling at the fellow's stupidity, the young gentleman bid him cease his wonder and assist in bearing her to the farm which was the nearest house. The dear creaure never spoke during the whole time, indeed she seemed totally incapable of uttering a word, when they got her to the house she drank a few spoonfulls of milk, which somewhat revived her, but her voice was still so weak they were unable to distinguish what she said, and her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind was disturbed, the good woman of the house had her put immediately to bed, and Isaac the labourer came home to let his master and mistress know were their daughter was. When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs. Howard clasped her hands and cried, my child deprived of her senses! she had not time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for this violent emotion in a man, who had never shewn any great degree of tenderness towards his child, but I think I never saw the fondest parent more affected. When the family became tolerably composed, it was proposed that I should take a chaise and proceed to the farm, when if Miss Howard was able to bear the motion of the carriage, I was to conduct her home; if not, to remain with her; and her mother would come to her in the morning. When I arrived at the farm, and was shewn into the room where my dear young lady was; my agitation was so great I thought I should have died; she had on being first put to bed fallen into a little doze, but soon started and awoke in great terror, and finding herself undressed, screamed out, “oh heavens! I am betrayed, I am lost, he is here; I know he is here, and I will not stay another moment.” She then insisted on being dressed. The neighbouring apothecary had been previously sent for; he felt her pulse and declared that the disorder lay entirely on her spirits; that every nerve seemed convulsed, and she also appeared to be greatly weakened for want of proper sustenance. She was prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink a little weak wine and water; after which she became a little more composed, and had sunk into a profound sleep on the side of the bed. In this situation I found her; the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that stood by the bed side, his head stretched out to the pillow of his mistress, whom he had not quitted for a moment since her entrance into the house. This dog had been missing ever since Miss Howard's absence, but our minds had been occupied by thoughts of so much more distressing a nature that Lubin was hardly remembered; he was greatly attached to her from her first return, and she remarkably fond of him. I sat down silently on the side of the bed, and looked at her dear countenance which so lately wore the bloom of youth and the smile of innocent chearfulness: alas! how changed, deadly pale where her cheeks and lips, and only that I percieved she breathed, I should have thought she was no longer an inhabitant of this world; my tears flowed plentifully. Her sleep, tho' apparantly found, was not of long continuance; she shrieked, awoke, and immediately started off the bed; I caught her hand, she turned hastily round. “Oh! it is you Deborah, is it, well now we will go. If you will accompany me, say so at once, if not I must go without you; for I cannot stay here another moment. But where is he now,” looking wildly round her, “Who are you talking of my dear,” said I, tenderly. “Ah! there is the thing now, I thought you would want to know his name, but I cannot tell you nurse, so do not ask me; I have made a vow, a solemn sacred vow, never to wound the peace of my dear, adored, mother.” “But my dear creature you have almost broken her heart by thus flying from her protection and your father.” “Father,” said she, “have I a father? Oh! that I had never been born.” She then began to rave in a most incoherent manner, and declared she would not stay another moment in the house. I took this opportunity with the permission of the apothecary to convey her home: when the chaise stopped at the door she looked out, and clapping her hand to her forehead, cried “yes I see how it is, well, well, it will not be long before I am released, and till then, I must be patient.” I assisted her in alighting, she leaned on my arm and walked slowly into the house; Mrs. Howard was so overcome she was unable to rise from her seat. Meriel looked for a moment at her attentively, then shaking her head in a most sorrowful manner, she G 2 cried, “oh! I see I have afflicted you, but, alas! my own heart is overwhelmed with sorrow; and then when I think for a moment, there are some remembrances which must be ever buried in my heart, that torture me so, my brain seems on fire.” Mrs. Howard attempted to speak, but unequal to the task, she clasped her hands in an agony, and sobbed aloud: Meriel sunk on her knees before her, took both her hands, put them first to her head and then to her heart; and breathing a deep sigh, fell lifeless on the floor. We had her immediately conveyed to bed, where she soon recovered; but a violent fever come on, and she continued raving all night. Mr. Howard has not yet seen her, he says if the girl's spirits are in such perturbation, the sight of him, whom she must be conscious she has offended, would only irritate them more, when she is better I will see her, said he, and forgive her, that will calm and comfort her. A physician was sent for; he said quiet and tenderness from those about her are the chief things requisite to restore her. In the mean time, my dear madam, said he, I will send her a composing draught; if when she recovers the use of her reason, you can prevail with her to unburthen her mind, which, I am certain labours with some painful secret, it would greatly assist and hasten her recovery. Thus far, my dear Miss, have I given you an account of this mysterious affair. What to think of her sudden departure, and being found in such a shocking situation, we are all totally at a loss. It appears she has been terrified and extremely ill used by somebody; but even in the most violent paroxisms of her delirium, she has never mentioned his name. I have one thought that haunts me continually; but that is so horrible I dare not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too dreadful, too shocking to human nature, to wear even the face of probability. The medicines prescribed have taken the desired effect, and she has been in a composed sleep above three hours. I will not conclude till I can inform you how she appears on awaking, as I know your affection for her will make you extremely anxious. She awoke tolerably calm, instantly recollected where she was, but did not seem to retain any idea of the late unhappy events. “It is late, nurse,” said she, addressing herself to me “is it not time to get up,” then pausing a moment, “I have had such a horrid dream. Oh! I would not pass such another night:” she then attempted to rise; but finding herself extremely weak, she continued, “what is the matter; have I been ill?” “Yes, my love,” said I, “you have been very ill, and are far from well now.” “Then perhaps it was not a dream,” said she, putting her hand to her forehead, as if trying to recollect; she was silent for a few moments, then caught hold my hand, and bursting into tears, she cried, “alas! it was all a reality.” I did not attempt to stop her tears, as I thought they would relieve her. She asked for her mother; seemed pleased to see her, but was too weak to talk much. The physician has just seen her, and declares her in a fair way to do well. I hope, Miss, you will excuse all errors in this long letter, as I thought you would be anxious to know all the particulars, I have dwelt on the subject more than perhaps was necessary, but will now no longer intrude. I am, dear Miss, Your very humble servant, DEBORAH ELLIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VIII. MERIEL to CELIA. Woodbine Cot, Sept. 10th, 1775. Once more, my beloved Celia, I am permitted to address you; but I will not address you in the voice of complaint, because I might have been far more wretched than I am. Much gratitude is therefore due to that benignant power, who has protected me through many dangers, and saved me from an evil which I could hardly have endured and lived. My senses too are restored, my life preserved by almost a miracle; and shall I, surrounded by these marvelous blessings, dare to repine because I do not enjoy that tranquility of heart which young women of my age and fortune in general possess. I do not repine; I submit to the chastening hand of heaven, I hope with that patience, which is the Christian's duty. I do not even presume to enquire, why these things are permitted; but yet my heart bleeds with my recent afflictions, and would fain seek ease by pouring forth its sorrows to that dear friendly girl, who will pity and sooth them. You must, long ere this, have received Deborah's letter, which has no doubt filled you with amazement. It is my sad task to explain to you the mystery that invelopes my conduct. To no other person breathing will I unfold my labouring heart: no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my my dear suffering mother: but to you, Celia, to you whose thoughts are detached from the world, to you who will consider this confidence as sacred: to you I will venture to disclose a scene, the remembrance of which, even at this moment, chills the vital tide that nourishes my heart. But you, my gentle friend, well I know, tho' struck with horror at the tale I shall unfold, will join with me in offering to the throne of grace, fervent prayers for the author of my sorrows. “Oh thou Father, creator of the universe, look down upon him, pardon his manifold offences, touch his heart that he may see his errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot this last transgression from the book of life.” This is my daily prayer—but to proceed in my sad task: The day my mother went into Effex I felt my spirits unusually oppressed, I rode out in the afternoon with my father, he was extremely gay in his conversation, indeed, I thought too much so, as he treated some subjects with a levity which greatly shocked me, and some expressions escaped him which wounded my delicacy, but this did not so much surprise me as he had frequently indulged himself in very improper conversation, not only before me, but other young women, who visited at the house, for which my mother always reproved him, but he in general turned it off with a laugh. However, as I had no person with me in the chaise, his manner was extremely embarassing, nay even distressing, for he saluted me several times, told me he was afraid of shewing much affection to me before my mother, who in her heart hates me; but, that if I was a good girl, he would not care for my mother, but shew me every kindness in his power; that I should go where I pleased, and do whatever my inclinations led me to. Astonished at this conversation, I hardly knew what to answer, and was extremely glad when we got home. I would have retired immediately to my appartment, but he insisted on my staying to sup with him, saying he had ordered a chicken on purpose for me. I reluctantly complied. During supper he drank very freely and would have had me drink several glasses of wine; which as I was unaccustomed to I resolutely refused. When I had supped he would have me play him a tune, after which he sung a song more adapted to the taste of a libertine than the chaste ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired, and, tho' greatly surprized at my father's conduct, yet having nothing particularly heavy on my mind, I soon fell asleep, I never had been used to lock my door, and you may imagine my terror when being awoke by a noise in the room, I felt a man's hand take hold of mine; I gave a faint scream, fright deprived me of much power, but how were my fears increased, when I heard my father say, “hush! don't make a noise, it is only me.” “You, sir,” I replied, starting up, “and what can be the cause of your coming here.” I cannot remember his answer, Celia, but I know he caught me in his arms. I sprang from him with a violent effort, and quitting the bed, the darkness of the night befriended me and I rushed out of the room into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept my apartment for several days, nor did I intend to have left it again till my mother's return, pretending indisposition; but he wrote me a letter, in which he asserted that he had mistaken my chamber for the housemaid's, with whom he confessed he had an intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating confession from a father to a child, sure none but an unprincipled rake could have brought himself to make it. He begged I would not mention the circumstance to my mother, and promised amendment in future. Alas! I was deceived by this letter and again ventured down to my meals. The day Deborah had leave to go out I spent the chief part below, he was remarkably reserved in his behaviour, and seemed even indifferent and inattentive to me, scarcely speaking the whole day. At supper I drank as usual one glass of wine and then retired; I felt an unaccountable drowsiness come over me; but it had been a storm all the evening, and the almost incessant flashes of lightning, with distant rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging it. I had partly undressed myself and was sitting on the side of the bed endeavouring to compose myself, (for I am greatly terrified at lightning,) when the door opened, and my father entered; he immediately shut the door and turned the key. To describe my horror is impossible, or to give you the most distant idea of the scene that ensued; but never to the latest hour I have to breathe, will it be erased from my memory. My repeated screams were of no avail. Deborah was from home, and the other maids slept too far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I wish that the vivid lightning, which every moment illumined the room, would strike me dead. At length a most tremendous clap Vol. I. H of thunder burst as it were directly over us. It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt, but it encouraged me. I seized the opportunity to fling open the window and declare, if he did not instantly quit my chamber, I would throw myself out, and seeing a penknife lay on the window seat, I snatched it up: “come not near me, sir,” said I, “for the moment you lay your hand upon me, this shall put an end to your existence.” my fury which had wrought me almost to a state of frenzy, intimidated him. “Be patient, Meriel,” said he, “shut the window and get into bed, you will catch your death with cold.” “Better be dead,” said I, “than live with dishonour.” “I swear,” he replied, “by all that is sacred, if you will go quietly to bed I will quit the room immediately.” “You shall quit it instantly,” said I, in a menacing accent; “am I not your child, and do you dare invade the virtue it is your duty to protect?” Celia, I felt at that moment as tho' I could have encountered almost any thing; that I could have bared my bosom to the stroke of death, and even met the blow with thankfulness; he saw my increasing frenzy, and trembling unlocked the door and left the room. The moment he was gone I locked myself in, and overcome with horror and distress, fell almost lifeless on the bed: how long I continued in this state of torpor I cannot tell; but the first use I made of my returning senses was to think of escaping from the house, and in this I was resolutely determined, when I heard him again at the door demanding admission: the candle was now gone out, and the window still open; the thought was momentary: I formed no plan for support, nor even thought of a place where to seek an asylum; but, starting up, I pulled the sheets off the bed, and, undressed as I was, slipped by them into the garden. How I escaped, unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the moment I felt myself on the ground I thanked God for my deliverance, and going out of the back garden gate, ran as fast as my strength would permit, as I imagined, toward a neighbouring village; but as the day began to dawn, I found I had taken a wrong road, and was at the entrance of a large wood; I was afraid to return, lest I should meet my father; therefore, forcing my way into the thickest part, I found a little hovel, which had been made by some unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry leaves: into this poor shelter I crept, and here first discovered that my faithful Lubin was with me. The little affectionate animal crept close up to me, licking my hands and face, as tho' he wished to comfort me; in this situation, my cloaths wet, my spirits harrassed, and nature overcome, I sunk into a slumber. But here I must drop my pen, for memory no longer bears any traces of the ensuing scenes, till I awoke in my own bed and saw Deborah weeping by my side. Farewell, I will write again soon. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IX. MERIEL to CELIA. Woodbine Cot, Sept. 20th, 1775. My lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but I endeavour to keep up my spirits, as well as I am able, and conduct myself in such a manner as my own heart may acquit me. When I was quite recovered from my illness, my mother called me one day into her dressing-room and assured me, she would pardon my elopement, on condition I would inform her of the cause, and by what means I came in the shocking situation already described. You may be certain I felt myself greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give this dear parent the satisfaction she required, without planting a dagger in her heart. Indeed, my friend, I cannot but feel thankful, that in my frenzy I did not discover the whole horrid secret, as it would have only involved us all in much greater distress than we experience at present. I remained silent to my mother's question, but could not restrain my tears. She repeated it; conjuring me, in the most solemn manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell her what urged me to desert my home and friends. “Oh! my dear mother,” said I, “do not ask, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me to be silent on this subject; and, in every future action of my life, I will implicitly obey you.” “I fear, Meriel,” said my mother, “you have some unworthy reasons for this concealment: tell me, then, who advised you to this imprudent step, and who accompanied you in your flight?” “No one,” said I, “the resolution was hastily formed, and as hastily H 2 executed; but I had no adviser, no companion, nor do I think I ever went farther than the wood, where I was discovered.” “Meriel! Meriel!” said my mother, “I cannot believe you. It appears altogether improbable, that a young woman, without any apparent cause, should form a hasty resolution of running away; that she should chuse a tempestuous night to make her escape, without a companion, and hide herself in a wood with a design to starve herself to death. Tell me, child, and tell me sincerely, did you not once love Pringle?” “I thought I did, but it was a mistake of the heart.” “I fear, Meriel, that mistake has led to your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in your flight, and my child is lost to honour and to virtue. Is not this the cause of your obstinate silence: do you not fear that the villain, whom in your heart you still love, should be brought to answer for his inhuman desertion of you.” “Oh! no my dear mother,” said I, redoubling my tears, “indeed you wrong me, I never entertained a thought that I should blush to own, and if it was my last moment, I could, with safety to my conscience, declare that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of his family knew of my going away.” “Strange infatuation,” said she, angrily, “to assert such falsehoods. Oh Meriel! I had hoped better from you; but I am sorry to say, in this instance, I can place no confidence in your veracity.” Here my father entered the room, and would you believe it possible, Celia, he repeated to me every question which my mother had asked before. Astonishment riveted my tongue. I could not answer. My silence was accounted obstinacy, and my dear mother left me with these cruel words: “Dissembling, obstinate girl, I can never love you as I once did, though I will strive to forgive you.” My father scarcely now ever speaks to me, and seems in his heart to hate me, as he takes every opportunity in his power of mortifying me; construes my most innocent actions into faults, and is continually complaining to my mother of my indolence, and sulkiness, as he inhumanely terms that want of vivacity, for which he so well knows how to account. This ill humour I could bear patiently, but my mother's unkindness is worse than a dagger to my heart. I live in greater solitude than ever; I never go out, and when any company comes to the family, I in general retire to my own room; for my feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I had almost said inhuman questions, that are asked me by people who have no other interest in my fate, than as it serves to gratify their curiosity. Next week I expect my brother home from school; he does not return again, but is to be articled apprentice to a merchant in London. I shall not be sorry when he is gone, for I expect to suffer greatly from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia, heaven and you know how little I deserve them; and that thought shall be my comfort and support. Adieu my friend. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER X. MERIEL to CELIA. London, December 19th, 1775. You are, no doubt surprized to see from whence this letter is dated, and you will be much more so, when I inform you of the great change that has taken place in our circumstances, some little time after I last wrote to you, as I was sitting in my own room, indulging the most painful ideas, I heard a great confusion below, and, among the rest, my mother's voice repeatedly screaming for help. I ran down stairs into the parlour, from whence the noise proceeded, and on entering saw two ill looking men, one of which had seized my father by the collar, and the other was assisting to drag him away. “What is the matter,” said I, to the men, “what are you doing with my father?” “Oh! we will do him no harm,” said one of them; “he must only come away with us to my house, at Litchfield, till he has paid five hundred pounds.” “Five hundred pounds,” said I, “why, dear madam,” turning to my mother, “to whom does my father owe so much money.” “Oh child!” said he, “your mother knows nothing about the affair, I not only owe that, but three times the sum; we are inevitably ruined, and all by my own folly. I have been bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at Litchfield, who is gone off, and I shall have all his debts to discharge.” My poor mother sat weeping; and, on hearing this account, lifted up her eyes in speechless agony. I could not bear to see her distress. “It is a large sum to be sure gentlemen,” said I, “but it shall be paid, so let my father remain, and do you go away for to night; to-morrow we will send you the money.” Alas! Celia, how very little I knew of the world. The inhuman men laughed at me, and asked me, “when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go their prisoner on the bare word of a girl.” “If you will not take my word,” said I, “leave my fahter and take me, for it will break my dear mother's heart to have him carried to prison; but, as to me, it matters not what becomes of me.” “That won't do neither, Miss,” said they, “we must either have the money or take the gentleman away.” Alas!” said I, turning to my mother, “what can I do? they will not release him.” No my child,” said my mother, with more affection in her voice than I had heard for some time, “we must submit as patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then see what can be done.” My father went away cursing his evil genius. Why will people, Celia, when they bring misfortune on their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will find it always the case, and the more egregrious have been their errors, the more vehement their compalints. When they were gone, I exerted myself to console my mother, but her only answer was, “Ah Meriel! what will become of us, I see ruin approaching; I know of no way to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he do.” “Let me intreat you my dear mother,” said I, “not to let this accident thus distress you: can you suppose, that while I have the means of living in ease and comfort, I would suffer my parent or my brother to feel any embarrassment, which it is in my power to remove. Did I not solemnly promise the dear departed saint, who made me thus independant, never to forsake you?” “But alas! Meriel, have you not already broke that vow?” “Dear, dear madam, forgive, forget, that involuntary transgression; and believe me, there never was a heart that glowed with more filial love, or greatful tenderness, than mine does towards you. My fortune is your's, I will share it with you and my brother to the last shilling; nay to convince you of my sincerity, I would freely renounce it all, and depend on my labour for support.” My mother was affected, but it was only for a moment, she again assumed a look of coldness, and told me she feared I often suffered the warmth of my imagination to hurry me into expressions and promises, the nature of which I did not duly consider. She then bid me good night and left me. Grieved to be thought so very unworthy, by the person on earth I most loved, most wished to see happy, I could take no rest all night. As soon as day-light appeared I arose, and dressing myself as plain as possible, borrowing a black bonnet of Deborah, I determined to set out for Litchfield on foot; but, fearing my mother might be alarmed at my absence, I left a note informing her, in a few words, that I was gone to endeavour to prove myself worthy of her love. During my walk I revolved in my mind what steps to pursue. Mr. Sutten was joint guardian with my father: I had no doubt he had been sent for on account of the arrest, and hoped to prevail on him to advance sufficient money to make my poor mother easy in her mind. I therefore determined to go immediately to the house of the bailiff, and learn at whose suit my father had been arrested. From thence I would go to the creditor and endeavour to prevail with him to take half the money now, and the rest when I became my own mistress, which, according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at eighteen years old. Here busy reflection arose, and told me how very unworthy of my attention my father was, but he is my father still, said I, and tho' he has forgotten his duty towards me, it does not follow that I am to neglect mine to him: besides, religion teaches us to reward evil with good; and surely, if there is any way of awakening the person who injures us, to a sense of their guilt, it is by shewing them an example of christian charity, and good will; besides, my mother and brother have not injured me, and why should they suffer for the vices of my father? Occupied by these reflections, I entered Litchfield, and went directly to the bailiff's house. My father was not up; indeed I did not wish to see him if he had, so I only made the necessary enquiries, learnt who the creditor was, and proceeded directly to the street where he lived. Mr. Leeson is a man, who, for many years, served a nobleman in London, as I have been told, tho' Vol. I. I in what capacity, I never heard. In his service, he accumulated a considerable fortune, and married a lady, a particular friend of his lordship's. Soon after he procured a pension, with which he came down to Litchfield, the place of his lady's birth, where he is now reckoned a very great man. This was the person who had occasioned my father's imprisonment. On knocking at the door a servant appeared yawning, and examining my dress with a scrutinizing eye, asked what I wanted. “I wish too see Mr. Leeson,” said I, “on particular business.” “Humph,” said the fellow, standing with his back against the wall, his hands in his breeches pockets, “you must wait a good while before you can see him, for he is not up yet.” “Pray friend,” said I, “give me leave to go in and sit down till your master does get up.” “You may go down stairs,” said he, “if you will, and when master is stirring, I will let you know.” Humiliating, as it was, I went down stairs, sat down by the kitchen fire and dried my feet, which were wet, some rain having fallen in the night; my petticoat was also plashed with dirt. About nine o'clock, a spruce young woman, in a long white bedgown, came into the kitchen, and looking at me with a sort of contemptuous sneer, cries, “servant ma'am, pray who may you want?” Imagining, from her appearance, and the manner in which she put the question, that she might be some relation of the family, I rose from my seat, and answered I had business of much importance with Mr. Leeson. “Aye Mrs. Bridget,” cried a footman, who was cleaning some silver candlesticks, at the dresser; “when my lady's bell rings, you must let master know, this here young body has been waiting here ever since eight o'clock.” A young lass, in appearance a menial servant, now appeared, and spreading a fine napkin on the table, brought the breakfast things, toasted some oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James sat very comfortably down to breakfast; but during their repast, neither asked me if I would partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify their curiosity, by asking, how far I had walked, if I had been long in the country, and many other questions, equally impertinent and insignificant; to all which I answered in little more than monosyllables. At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget making a hasty finish of her breakfast, ran up stairs: soon after, the footman having equip'd himself as a valet, went out of the kitchen. I was now once more left to myself, but had not indulged reflection long, before the girl, who had prepared the breakfast, came and sat down, in order to eat her own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got up and held the oat cake (which was almost cold) to the fire, then casting a look, first at me, then at the table, in a mild accent, as tho' fearful of giving offence, said, “I am afraid you have not breakfasted ma'am; pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea,” hoiding the plate and tea towards me. “Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks she will like; but I thinks your London folks are all proud; they serves only to make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take it; I wish it was hotter and better.” “It is very good,” said I, taking a bit; for the poor girl's goodness of heart was so conspicuous that I could not mortify her by a refusal. She smiled, began drinking her own tea, and continued: “Mr. James was quite a different sort of a body, I assures you ma'am before he went to London last summer with my mistress; dear heart, he and I were so comfortable and happy, but when they came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget with her, and ever since”—She paused; I saw her eyes glisten. Poor girl, thought I, James is false hearted, he has forsaken thee for Bridget; and yet, if he had but discernment to perceive the difference between the two hearts, how gladly would he return to one so gentle and tender. Here I was interrupted by Mr. James himself, who told me his master desired me to walk up. I bade the kind hearted girl good morning, and followed James into the presence of his master. “Well, young woman,” said Mr. Leeson, who was standing with his back to the sire, and his hands behind him. (Celia I must here digress to give you some small idea of his person and manner.) A person rather above the middle size, a face, the features of which, might have been termed regular, and even pleasing, had benevolence, good humour or politeness been any way discernable in it, instead of which there was an insolent pertness, a supercilious, self-approving smile, that to my idea portrayed nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit. “Well, young woman,” said he, “what may be your commands with me.” “You are sir, I understand, the person who has caused Mr. Howard to be arrested.” He answered in the assirmative. “I waited on you, sir, to make some proposal concerning this affair, in hopes of being the means of his obtaining his liberty.” I 2 “What, do you belong to Mrs. Belmour?” “Belong to who sir?” in an accent of surprize. “To Mrs. Belmour; the woman for whom Howard has thus involved himself.” “I understood, sir, that he was bound for a friend.” “Well child, she was his friend, my friend, any body's friend: why sure you know her.” “Indeed, sir, I never heard of her before: I am Mr. Howards daughter.” “Bless my soul! Mr. Howard's daughter, are you; well I have often heard of you, tho' I never had the pleasure of seeing you before. I remember hearing of that strange affair of your running away after Ensign Pringle, and when he refused to have any thing to say to you, being afraid to go home again, you hid yourself in a wood, and went out of your senses.” Celia, can you for a moment suppose what, at that instant, were my feelings; unable any longer to support myself I sunk into the nearest chair, (for I had been kept standing) and burst into tears. “'Pon honour, Miss,” said he, “I beg pardon, I did not mean to make you uneasy; but when one hears such strange stories, one likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon my soul I wish I had been in Pringles place, I should not have driven such a pretty little kind soul to dispair.” During this speech he had drawn nearer to me and had taken one of my hands, which I drew from him with disdain. “Sir,” said I, with as much composure as I could assume, “you have been totally misinformed about that unhappy affair; and, pardon me, if I say, that it can be no business of your's, to enquire, what were the motives of a conduct, which, I find, has cast a fatal shade upon my reputation; I do not think myself accountable for my actions, to you or any other indifferent person: it is sufficient that heaven and my own heart acquits me of evil. I came here, Mr. Leeson, to consult about the liberation of my father; let me know on what terms that can be obtained, and I am ready to comply with them. “He cannot be liberated Miss,” said he, “without the debts being discharged, and costs of suit being paid.” “Well, sir, and to how much does that amount.” “To five hundred and twenty pounds.” “Well, sir, if I pay you three hundred now, and bind myself by the most solemn engagement to pay the other when I am eighteen, will you set Mr. Howard at liberty.” “There is the interest of the money, Miss, and then the hazard, this money being all advanced out of my own pocket, Miss, and you are only a minor you know.” “I sind, sir,” said I, rising from my seat, “that I am totally unsit to talk on these matters, being but little acquainted with the world, or what is daily acting in it; I will therefore take my leave, for the present, and return in about two hours with Mr. Sutten, my guardian, who will better understand how to settle the affair.” I now returned to the bailiff's house, where I learnt Mr. Sutten was with my father. I desired that he might be informed I was there, and wished to speak with him; but I must give you the result of our conversation in my next, as I have many things to attend to besides writing to my Celia. Ah! my dear girl, times are strangely altered, but, I thank heaven, I have health and more spirits than could be well expected after the painful scenes I have gone through; but no doubt I may have many more trials yet to endure. Pray for me, my friend, that I may have strength of mind to bear them as I ought, so as not to disgrace the religion of which I am a professor; and be assured, that every kind wish of my heart is daily offered up for your felicity; and that the remembrance of the happy, happy hours we have spent together, is ever present to the mind of your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XI. MERIEL to CELIA. London, January 3d, 1776. I have not had a moment to devote to my dear Celia since I dispatched the last, but as I know your friendly heart shares all the sufferings of your Meriel, I will now continue my narrative. When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was greatly surprised to see me at Litchfield, and when I told him of my visit to Mr. Leeson, he appeared very angry and said, “with his good will, I should not pay a farthing, and at any rate I should not have the money, till I was of age; for I might, if I attempted to extricate my father from his present difficulites, soon be reduced to beggary, and leave myself without the power of assisting my mother; who was far more deserving my affection and duty.” “It is on her account, sir,” said I, “that I am thus anxious. Her happiness is bound up with my father's, and while he is under confinement she will be miserable; besides, Mr. Sutten, she does not think I love her, does not think me capable of doing a worthy action. Oh! sir, give me the power to convince her, that my own interest and happiness is of little value when put in competition with her's.” “My dear miss Howard,” said he, “you must confess appearances have been strangely against you. I will acknowledge I myself have had my doubts concerning the rectitude of your heart.” “Oh! I know,” said I, “there is a fatal mystery involves my conduct, a mystery which I never can reveal.” “Nor will I desire it,” replied the humane Mr. Sutten, “I see at this moment such traits of genuine goodness, such proofs of a mind, impressed with a just sense of its duty, that I shall always think you had some very just cause for your past conduct, nor will I believe it possible for a heart capable of conceiving such noble, disinterested resolutions, to harbour inclinations derogatory to the honour and dignity of a virtuous woman.” I thanked him for his good opinion, and he proceeded: “You must consider, Miss Howard, that you are young, very young; you know but little of the world, of consequence can form no just value of that independence, which, believe me, can alone secure you friends. Beauty and merit, my dear girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to the posessors; it is an object of envy to your own sex; and, sorry I am to add, in general excites no other ideas in the bosom of ours, than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate those principles they pretend to adore; let me intreat you, therefore, to set a just value on that independence, with which it has pleased heaven to bless you; assist your parents as far as you can, without hurting yourself, and remember, that to secure the friendship of others you must not need their assistance.” This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a cold philosopher, and a man of the world; but it was not speaking with the spirit of christianity, or with the enthusiasm of a heart that glows with benevolence to all its fellow creatures. The dear lessons which I imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard myself but in a secondary light, when any thing praise-worthy was to be performed, and to remember only the precepts of him who taught us to do as we would be done by; and, like the good Samaritan, to pour oil and wine into the wounds of our suffering fellow creatures; but to proceed: Mr. Sutten refused to advance a shilling, and I was forced to return to my mother, disappointed, dejected, and weary. Two days after, an execution was sent to Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and myself were obliged to remove to Litchfield, where we took a small lodging near the house where my father was, where we remained till the estate was sold and all paid away to the last farthing, nor was even that enough to answer all the demands that were continually pouring in from all quarters; besides, when the estate came to be sold, it was found so encumbered with mortgages, &amp;c. that it would not sell for above half its value. When all was settled, and my father at liberty, it was determined that we should set forward to London, where my father insisted we could live much cheaper than in the country, where we were so well known. There was still the interest of my four thousand pounds, which as it was at my own disposal, I determined to devote to the support of the family. All our servants were discharged, poor Deborah too; you cannot think, Celia, what I suffered on being separated from this faithful Vol. I. K woman. She offered to stay with us without being paid; but my mother would not consent to reeicve an obligation from an inferior. I thought the resolution savoured of pride; but we all have our failings, and perhaps pride in some degree, is laudable. On our arrival in town, we took a small lodging and hired a young woman to do the most laborious part of our domestic business; the rest it is my province to perform; and, believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs my mind, prevents my taking melancholy retrospects, and I think contributes to improve both my health and spirits. We have paid a visit to my father's eldest sister. She is married to a counsellor, who has made a genteel independence by his profession. My aunt is a woman whose character I do not well know how to develope. She is in general affable, condescending, and chearful; and in conversation, gives evident proofs of a genteel education, and a brilliant understanding; but, withall is so tinctured with vanity, and tho' upwards of forty, still possesses that spirit of coquetry, that in a great measure obscures her good qualities. Her daughters, Hester and Susan, have had, what is termed a fashionable education, that is, they can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of the harpsichord, and jabber an unintelligible jargon, which they call French. They are realy lovely girls. Hester, in particular, seems calculated to inspire love and respect, wherever she appears. Susan is more volatile, but, withall can make herself extremely agreeable. They are both spoilt by the mother, who, having taken it into her head, that their beauty will certainly recommend them to men of rank and fortune, is continually filling the poor girls' minds with that kind of vanity, and eager desire of conquest, that in general fails of the desired effect, and repels the admiration, which it is designed to attract. Their naturally good dispositions are by these means totally preverted, and instead of being the engaging, innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature form'd them, they appear, in a mixed company, a combination of pride, vanity, and self-conceit. Mr. Mosop, their father, is haughty, distant, and forbidding in his manner, posesses a great deal, of what is called family pride: has little feeling and less good nature, yet on the whole is deemed a respectable character. He is strictly honest in his principles, pays every one their due to the utmost farthing, but will not bestow the least trifle in charity, because he considers constantly paying the poor rate to be a sufficient discharge of that duty. The query with me, is, whether he would pay that sum yearly if not obliged to it; if not, where is the merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how do I hate those luke-warm hearts. You may remember I always shewed a dislike to the cool doctrines of philosophy. I could never have a good opinion of a person who regards every surrounding object with the stoical eye of apathy. I am sure they must possess hearts, rendered impenetrable by nature to those fine feelings, which, tho' at some moments they may distress, in general elevate and expand the soul. For my own part, Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever a scene of distress or happiness meets my eye, I have a tear of sympathy for the one, and a smile of gratulation for the other; and the smile and the tear, mingle so sweetly with each other, that every faculty is harmonized by the union, and I am at a loss to tell which sensation is the most exquisitely delightful. Then let the unfeeling boast the philosophic calmness of their tempers. I will not scruple to aver, that tho' they may escape many an acute pang, that wrings the heart of sensibility, they know not what true pleasure is. But I am strangely digressing from my subject. You will wonder perhaps, how I so soon comprehended the character of my uncle's family: believe me, Celia, it was not by my own penetration that I discovered them. From my own observations, I should have supposed Mr. Mossop an agreeable man, his wife a charming, amiable woman, and the two young ladies the sweetest, most engaging girls in the world; nay, at this very moment, I feel so inclined to love the whole family, that I think the disagreeable traits in their characters have been exaggerated. It was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted for this minute delineation of them. This Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man, whom I have frequently seen at my uncle's, and at first thought he was partial to my cousin Hester, but I find I was mistaken in this supposition, as his intimacy in the family proceeds from his having been school-fellow with young Mossop, whom I have as yet seen but little of. Rainsforth is the son of a merchant, in Plymouth. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father has, within these few years, married a woman many years younger than himself, by whom he has a young family. Frederic has a small fortune independent of his father, and is besides a lieutenant in the navy. My father seems very partial to him; that, you will say, is no great recommendation; but I flatter myself, Celia, this unhappy father begins to see K 2 his errors, and will, in future atone for them. I think, tho' our income is circumscribed, and our situation greatly altered, my dear mother is much happier than I ever saw her. I cannot boast of much happiness myself; remembrance, painful rembrance, damps every little pleasure or amusement that is offered to my notice; yet, when I look round me, and behold many who are perhaps my superiors in worth and virtue, perishing for want of the common necessaries of life; oppressed with sickness; surrounded with children, who look up to them for that support, which they have not to bestow: when I see these things, my friend, I lift up my heart in humble gratitude to that Providence, who has, thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the overplus of which may, in some little degree, serve to cheer the sons and daughters of misery. You smile to hear me talk of having any to spare from my little income. Oh! my dear girl, had I but a shilling in my pocket, I could not call it my own, if I saw a fellow creature whose heart would be in the least lightened by sharing it with me. My aunt has promised to take me to a play. I am fond reading dramatic works, and form great expectations of amusement from seeing a performance. I will certainly give you some account of my entertainment whenever I go. Till then, and ever, believe me affectionately your's. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XII. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 3d, 1776. I never shall get used to the ways of London, and I am always bringing myself into difficulties, and foolish embarrasments, through my ignorance; then my mother is angry, and what in reality proceeds from simplicity of my nature, is construed into art or levity. I have been fretting these two hours about a circumstance that has highly offended my dear mother; and, I am sure, Celia, I did it without a thought of harm. I had been out a little way yesterday, and was returning in the close of the evening, when I heard a very genteel looking elderly gentleman enquiring the way to a street which lay in my way home; the person whom he addressed could not direct him, and I, unconscious of any impropriety, stepped forward and told him, as it lay in my way, I would shew him the place he enquired for: he seemed much obliged to me, and said, “as we were going the same way I might as well take hold of his arm;” but this, as he was quite a stranger, I refused to do; however, I could not help answering some civil questions, which he asked, and when we arrived at the street he had mentioned, he insisted on seeing me safe home: this I remonstrated against, saying, besides giving him unnecessary trouble, it would make my mother very angry with me. At this he declared he knew my mother very well, and he was not at all afraid of her anger, as he was certain it lay in his power to appease it. I was surprised, you may imagine, and indeed very uneasy all the rest of the way, as I knew how offended my mother would be, at seeing a stranger come home with me. When the servant opened the door he walked in without any ceremony, and going into the parlour which was occupied by the gentlewoman who keeps the house, he thus addressed her, “Servant, my good madam, your lovely daughter here, having kindly given me an invitation home, I flatter myself we shall spend a chearful evening, and you and I, my good mother, shall not disagree, I warrant.” Mrs. Fermor stared, and I felt ready to sink into the earth. “You are under a mistake, sir,” said I, “pray leave me.” “What, leave you, my little dove, when you have been so very kind, no, no! hardly such a fool as that; come mother, what shall I order in for supper, and what wine will you drink?” “Miss Howard,” said Mrs. Fermor, “I am overwhelmed with astonishment; how have you dared to bring this gentleman here to insult me?” “Indeed madam,” I replied, terrified beyond measure, “I am innocent of any intention to offend you; this gentleman”—“Why, I can tell the tale as well as you my pretty one,” said he, interrupting me: “you must know, madam, I was coming into Westminster, and did not rightly know my way, so, this pretty, kind hearted damsel was so good as to shew me, that is all, ma'am, and so in return, I am only grateful, and would willingly treat you with a good supper, and as far as ten guineas would go.” At this moment my father came in, and seeing me stand trembling in the parlour, a fresh scene of confusion insued, which ended in the whole family believing I had invited the old gentleman home with me, merely out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it, an indiscreet frolic. You may suppose how rigorous my mother was, how angry my father; for tho' in his heart, he has not the least regard for real virtue, he always pretends great attention to my conduct, and this evening declared he would rather follow me to the grave than see me lost to honour. Oh! Celia, how my soul detests his hypocrisy. It gives me great uneasiness to find just as my mother began to have a better opinion of me, I have again lost her considence; am again abridged of my walks, and at home see only the frown of displeasure, sit on that face which once beamed on me the smile of maternal tenderness. My brother is at length settled in an eminent merchants counting-house; I have engaged myself to pay the necessary sum, when I am put in possession of my fortune; and, to tell you the truth, Celia, I am resolved to stay in my father's family no longer than that time; but, by some genteel employment, endeavour to earn subsistence for myself, as I am determined not to deprive my mother of support, by taking the money into my own hands. March 5th. My aunt has just called, and after a great deal of persuasion, has prevailed with my mother to let me go to the play to-morrow evening; I am to go out this afternoon with my cousins, to purchase some few articles of dress necessary to my appearing at a public place, as my aunt always takes my cousins to the most conspicuous part of the theatre. Well, it will be of little consequence to me, where we sit; I go to see and not to be seen, I wish to be amused myself, but have not the least ambition to be the amusement of others, either from my person, dress or manner. Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my person, I should now be perfectly cured of so ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for me, that I never thought my face more than passable; and as to my shape, I knew it had not the smallest pretentions to either grace or elegance; and, by having this humble opinion, I have escaped a severe mortification; for you know, my Celia, the severest reflections loose their force, when we can listen to them with good humour, and return an answer with a smile. I accompanied my aunt and cousins to a milliner's; Mr. Rainsforth and young Mossop were of the party. I am astonished how young men can suffer themselves to be dragged as it were to such places, and have the patience to listen to a tedious desertation on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred other trifles, almost below the notice of a rational being. But, if I was surprised at that, how much more was I to see a parcel of powdered effeminate animals, for I will not call them men, stuck up behind a counter, measuring a peny-worth of tape or a smaller quantity perhaps; telling you with the gravity of a philosopher, that such a ribond become your delicate complexion; such a cap set off your features to advantage, &amp;c. And, will you believe it possible, that one morning being in a perfumer's shop, I saw an officer in the army, purchasing chicken gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye, and for his own use too, for the master informed me he had neither wife nor sister, to whom such things might have been of use. Well, to the milliner's we went, where Hester and Susan having chosen their caps. I was pleased with the choice of the fomer, and said I would have one like it. “Lord, my dear,” said my aunt, “how can you think of such a thing, pretty women you know may wear any thing, but those that are plain should study what will most become them.” “Aye,” cried young Mossop, “my cousin to be sure should not wear any thing that atrtacts general notice.” “Here,” said Susan, “here Meriel, is a very pretty cap, I think it will become you vastly.” It was etremely plain, having no ornament but a knott of white sattin ribbon. “You are quite right, cousin,” said I, “this cap will certainly suit me best. I never love to be fine, and what will be becoming on you, will only appear an affectation of finery on me.” I said this with a smile, as I tried on the cap. Mr. Rainsforth told my aunt he thought true beauty required few ornaments. “Come, come, you rally,” said she, “you can't think Meriel handsome.” He made no answer, but smiling, sung the following stanza, which, as it contained a delicate compliment, you will pardon me if I here repeat it. Vol. I. L She is not fair, but yet I swear, To me she has ev'ry grace, Her lovely mind I always find, Depicted in her face. But, my Celia will say my letters begin to be very insipid, when I can find no other theme than the repetition of my own praise. Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be careful how I offend again. March 7th. My entertainment last night, exceeded my most sanguine expectations; the house, the lights, the brilliant and numerous audience, on my first entrance, filled me with silent astonishment; but my cousins declare they never will go to the play with me again, for at the pathetic and interesting parts, I could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane Shore. Long did I struggle to suppress my tears; the effort was vain, and when in the last scene, they drag the just reconciled husband from the arms of his dying wife, the half smothered sobs burst forth, and I fell back in an hysteric. You cannot think, how I was laughed at, and my cousins declare they were so shocked at my behaviour, that they shall be ashamed to shew their faces at the playhouse again this season. “One would think child,” said my aunt, in a peevish tone, as I began to recover, “you never had seen a play in your life before.” “Well, you know I never did,” said I, aloud. This compleated my disgrace, and my aunt turning toward the stage, noticed me no more the whole evening. I think if I were to go again, I should like to sit in some unnoticed corner, where I could give sensibility the reins, and whilst I wept the woes of those whose sorrows now rest in the silent grave, I would so mould my heart, as it should be ever ready to partake and alleviate the afflictions of those who still move on the busy stage of life. One thing, my cousins informed me of, which considerably damped my pleasure during the evening. They said, that many of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I saw in the boxes, were the slaves of vice, and purchased the gaudy trappings, by which they were adorned, by the wages of guilt; and that (but I can hardly think it possible) some of them are so lost to every sense of virtue, that they come to those public places with no other view than to attract new lovers; and what is still worse, that in a few years; nay, perhaps even in a few months, I may see those lovely blooming women walking the streets, subject to the insults of every brutal passenger, and sinking into an untimely grave, under the complicated evils of poverty, sickness and disgrace. I felt my eyes fill as Hester concluded; and do you not pity them, said I: “La! cousin,” said she, “you are the strangest girl; you make one laugh to see you now, with that long dismal face, talking about pity for such wretches.” “Perhaps,” said I, “they had no friend to teach them better, and surely, tho' we may shudder with detestation at their vices, humanity still leads us to pity their sufferings.” “You are as old fashioned in your notions, Meriel,” said my aunt, who had overheard us, “as you are in your dress and manner. You will know better child when you have seen a little more of the world.” I must now quit my pen to assist in some necessary domestic business. Believe me, Celia, there is no pleasure so agreeable as writing to you. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIII. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 30th, 1776. Last night, having spent the evening with my father and mother, at my uncle's; when we were coming home Mr. Rainsforth put a letter into my hand as he handed me into the coach: I could not well return it or I would, so was obliged to put it in my pocket; however, I resolved not to open it till I had first shewn it to my mother. When we got home, it was late, and all immediately retired to bed. I will confess it cost me no little trouble to stiflle the curiosity that prompted me to open the letter. I put it in a drawer and turned the key; but, just then recollecting that I wanted something that was in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again, took up the letter, read the address, looked attentively if the wafer was dry; and, after viewing it on every side near a dozen times, L 2 resolution at length repelled curiosity, I returned it to the drawer and locked it again, without once recollecting why I had opened it the second time. In the morning I waited till we had done breakfast, and then putting the letter into my mother's hand, said, “I hope, my dear madam, this will convince you I would not willingly be guilty of an impropriety, or have a concealment of this nature from my best friend.” She took it with a cold look of suspicion, and having read it, said “I suppose you know the contents.” “Indeed I do not,” was the reply. “You can guess, I imagine,” said she; “no gentleman would have had the temerity to put a letter into a young lady's hand in such a clandestine manner, had he not been pretty certain that it would not be refused.” “Good heavens!” said I, bursting into tears, “shall I never regain your confidence? Must every action, however innocent, be misconstrued or liable to suspicion.” “Why Meriel,” said she, “will you endeavour to persuade me, Mr. Rainsforth has never entertained you on the subject of love.” “If I may be believed madam,” said I, with a firm voice, “he never uttered a syllable to me that could be construed into more than common politeness.” “Well, child, read the letter then, and tell me your opinion of the contents.” I felt my face glow as I cast my eye over the letter, which contained a profession of ardent affection and an offer of his hand, if my father approved the union. “You ask my opinion, dear mother,” said I, “and I will candidly give it; I think Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man, from what little I have seen, but it is impossible that I can form any just idea of his character, from so short an acquaintance; If when upon a greater intimacy, I should find him in reality possessed of those valuable qualifications, honour and benevolence, and my father and yourself have no objection, I will not hesitate to confess, I could give him my hand, not only without reluctance, but with pleasure.” “But suppose, Meriel, your father should object.” “If you, madam, should also disapprove, I hope I know my duty too well to complain; since your knowledge of mankind in general, must make you a much better judge of what will be really conducive to my happiness, than I can possibly be myself; however, madam, if such objections should arise, I hope you will inform me soon, that I may early begin to teach my heart a lesson which, some little time hence, I may find a difficulty in making it obey.” My mother made no answer, and soon after I left the room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth called; I felt the colour flush to my face: when he entered he glanced his eyes toward me; but I believe they brought him no intelligence concerning the reception his letter had met with. He had not been seated above ten minutes before my mother made some excuse to send me out of the room; I understood her perfectly, and was not in haste to return; in about an hour I was sent for to make tea, but it was the most unsocial meal I had ever partaken of, when Rainsforth was present: he was silent; I was embarrassed, and my father and mother, as is in general the case, spoke to each other but little. When tea was over he took his leave, when my father acquainted me I had his permission to recieve his addresses; said he believed him a man of honour, and, if his friends raised no objection to the union, he thought the sooner it was compleated the better. Does not this eagerness to dispose of me, shew how painful my presence is to him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we seldom like to be much in company with those persons whom we are conscious of having injured. And now, my dear Celia, you will perhaps wonder at my so readily listening to an offer of marriage from a man with whom I have so small an acquaintance, but indeed my situation at home is far from being agreeable. My mother's affections seem totally alienated from me, and lavished with redoubled tenderness on my brother, who, I am sorry to say, repays it with ingratitude and disrespect. He is continually teizing her for money, and tho' he is conscious there is no source from whence that money can proceed, except from me, yet he is continually tormenting me by some ill natured trick or other. If we are in a mixed company, every word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I sit silent, then sister is studying something clever to say; if I deliver my sentiments on any subject that excites my sensibility or veneration, then sister is going to turn a sentimental actress, or a methodist preacher; even the respect I pay to my religious duties is an object of ridicule, in which my pretty cousins always join. If I express my dislike of cards, gadding, and its attendant scandal, and my love of retirement, study and domestic employment, then he wonders what Mrs. Mirvan could mean by leaving me a fortune, who could be so well content with “—pounds three-score, For meat and books, nor ask for more.” To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel would make an excellent poor man's wife; and these expressions often escape them before people, who think it degrading to be able to perform, for themselves, any of the necessary offices of life; and would blush to death were they supposed to know how to make or mend their own linen; for my own part, I cannot help thinking, if those fine ladies had a little more useful employment on their hands, they would not have so much time to investigate and expose the actions of their neighbours. You must imagine, my dear girl, that I lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and Mr. Rainsforth always shews that attention to me, and takes my part, with such delicacy as must unavoidably awaken my gratitude, if not my affection; and believe me, I now begin to feel the difference between a real attachment and the illusive wanderings of the heart. I know how to value the virtues of my lover, at the same time I feel a much stronger inclination to act in all things with that propriety as may render me respected. I feel now the true value of reputation, honour and virtue, because I entertain a hope of being one day united to a man, whose character would be injured by my want of either: and, oh! my Celia, what a blush of confusion often spreads my cheeks, when I reflect on the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I shudder at the bare possibility of those letters one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth. Wrote, as they were, at a time when my imagination was so strongly tinctured with the style of the books I had been reading, that I almost involuntarily wrote the very sentiments which I had just embibed, with all the enthusiasm of romantic affection. Ah! Celia, those books drew very deceitful pictures of human life, their false colouring had raised my expectations and exalted my ideas, of love and friendship, far above any thing I can find in the little circle of acquaintance I have formed. Perhaps those elevated sentiments and actions may be confined to people of an elevated sphere of life, for I never remember meeting with any hero or heroine of a story, but either were at first, or afterwards proved to be persons of rank and fortune: but those are people so far above me, I can never hope to form any acquaintance with them. I see them daily pass me in their carriages, surrounded with affluence, attended with respect; yet surely if I know my own heart, I do not envy them, except, when I think of the power they possess to cheer the poor wretch humbled by affliction, and to cause the broken heart to rejoice. Envy, did I say, oh! no, it is not envy, it is a sentiment I cannot find a name for, it is a wish to enjoy those transporting feelings myself, without taking from their felicity; it is an earnest desire to promote, not decrease, the happiness of every human being. You, my Celia, secluded from the world, in devout retirement, can form but a faint idea of the many miseries with which this variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend, and there are pleasures too, but they are not in general suited to my taste. I hate a crowd; it may for a moment dazzle the senses, but it leaves no impression on the heart. In my opinion, we cannot experience real pleasure, if we are devoid of happiness; and of this I am certain, happiness can seldom be drawn from external objects, but is sure to dwell in the heart, conscious of performing its duty. That such happiness, may ever be your's and mine, prays your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIV. MERIEL to CELIA. London, May 17th, 1776. Since my last, few incidents have happened, worthy the notice of my Celia, except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my declared lover, has astonished all my uncle's family. My mother says she is sure Hester and Susan are ready to burst with envy; I cannot think it. That dear woman has met with so many painful incidents, in her way thro' life, that her naturally amiable temper, is soured, and she views every thing with a jaundiced eye. My cousins seem highly delighted with the idea of an approaching wedding, and declare they will be my bride maids. They are mistaken in thinking the wedding will be so soon, Mr. Rainsforth being obliged to join his ship, which belongs to the grand fleet at Spithead, and I rather wish to remain single till this summer's cruise Vol. I. M is past. If he returns safe, I need not tell you with what joy I shall fulfill my engagements: if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence of his country, I will come to you my beloved Celia, and become a pensioner in the convent for life. My religion will not permit me to take the veil; but my vow of celibacy will be as sincere, breathed from my own heart to the great Judge of all our actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the altar, surrounded by all the pomp of monkish superstition. Pardon me, my beloved friend, I mean no reflection on the religion you profess. I think that it is not the form but the heart that is an acceptable sacrifice: and the soul that humbles itself before its Maker, and cries “pardon my numerous transgressions, I am but a worm before thee, the creature of thy infinite power: if thou shouldest forsake me, who will dare to be my friend; difpose of me as in thy wisdom thou shalt think fit; I will not complain, but will take the lot appointed, with submission.” That soul, my Celia, let its form of worship be what it may, will one day shine resplendent in the mansion of its Creator. Oh! with what rapture can we approach the throne of mercy, when with a heart overflowing with gratitude, we can say, in the words of our admired Pope: “Teach me to feel another's woe, To hide the fault I see; That mercy I to others show, That mercy shew to me.” But I know my Celia is as void of bigotry as she is of every other error. As Mr. Rainsforth is now, I will not deny, the first object of my esteem, I must inform you of the reasons which have by degrees conspired to raise him thus in my opinion. The day after that mentioned in my last letter, I received one from him, a copy of which I have enclosed for your perusal, also my answer, and his second letter. After you have read them, I think you will not blame my partiality. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XV. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD, (Enclosed in the foregoing.) MADAM, From a conversation I had lately with Mr. Howard, I find you have made your parents the confidants of a passion, which I hardly dared venture to disclose, even to the dear object who had excited it; and pardon me, if I say some peculiarities in the manner of both Mr. and Mrs. Howard, has been the cause of my not applying to them for leave to address their lovely daughter; nor indeed, did I think it quite consonant with the idea of female delicacy, to apply for the parents approbation, before I could flatter myself that approbation would be entirely agreeable to the person, whose good will I am most solicitous to obtain. I thank you a thousand times, dear, amiable young lady, for the sweet hope you have authorised your father to give me; your conduct has, if possible, raised you in my esteem; and I look forward with a certainty of felicity to the moment that shall unite us by indissoluble ties; for sure a woman who has so high a sense of filial duty, must ever retain a proper idea of the equally incumbent duties which will arise from the married state; her husband's honour will be safe in her hands; her children will look up to her as their friend, and blessings will attend her footsteps wherever she appears. Oh! beloved Miss Howard, my heart, that perfectly understands your virtues, exults in paying them the homage due. The simplicity of your manner first charmed me, and pardon me if I say, I saw not the charms of your person, till I had learnt to adore the goodness of your heart; to guard that heart from every approaching evil, shall henceforth be my study: if you will favour me with a few lines from your own hand, to say you do not refuse me so charming a guardianship, and to confirm me in the hope of being not quite indifferent to you, it will be acknowledged as the highest obligation, by your faithful FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">M 2 LETTER XVI. MISS HOWARD to MR. RAINSFORTH. SIR, Gratitude will not suffer me long to remain silent or inattentive, to a letter, the contents of which, seem to breath only the spirit of sincerity; nor will I hesitate to confess, that the liberty my parents have granted is perfectly consonant with the feelings of my own heart. Every one who is honoured with the acquaintance of Mr. Rainsforth, must be sensible of his worth, and to find oneself the object of the tenderest esteem, to a truely worthy man, must certainly awaken a degree of laudable pride, in a bosom not devoid of sensibility. Accept my sincerest thanks for the many obliging sentiments you have expressed in my favour, and give me leave to mention a few circumstances with which you may be unacquainted, but which, I think it highly proper, you should be informed of. It is in general reported that I have four thousand pounds for my fortune. This report is false. I have only a fourth part of the sum. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan, made the will in my favour, but with these restrictions; that I should never suffer my family to feel the necessities of life. At that time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no prospect of their ever being reduced from a state of competency, to a dependence on their child; but such is the fluctuating state of human affairs, that this is exactly now the case. This state of dependence is extremely painful to me, and I am sure must be so to them. It is, therefore, my fixed determination, when I am of age, to settle the moiety of my fortune on my mother. I am under engagements for my father at present to the amount of five hundred pounds, and the other five hundred must be appropriated to the use of my brother, during his clerkship, and to help him forward a little when that is expired. This disposition of my little fortune, may make a material difference in your plans of life for the future, and I thought it but right to inform you, that no interest of my own, shall ever induce me to alter my resolution. If you think me still worthy of your attentions, I am your's. Do not smile at my frankness, I have not yet learnt to disguise the feelings of my heart. Do not hesitate to give a candid answer. If the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thousand pounds, seek not to excuse yourself for withdrawing your addresses, I will not even require an apology for a conduct, to which I am certain, nothing but the most powerful reasons, could have forced you. I am, Sir, your friend and humble servant, MERIEL HOWARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVII. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD. Shall I not chide you, my dear Miss Howard; shall I not tell you what I felt at the reception of your dear unkind letter. Dear it will ever be to my fond bosom, because in the sincerity of your language, I could read the affection of your heart. “Smile at your frankness;” how could you think of such a thing. No, I adore you for it, and surely the man who could despise a heart for its sincerity, deserves not to possess so invaluable a blessing. May Miss Howard never learn to disguise feelings which, chastened as they are, by honour and feminine delicacy, become an honour to the heart; but still I must chide. What could you think, when you say, “if the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thousand pounds.” Unkind Meriel, do you suppose millions could increase my love, or could they make you more valuable. No, they could not; therefore, dispose of your fortune in any manner you shall think fit, give me only yourself, and I shall think I possess a jewel, which worlds could not purchase. I am every day expecting orders to join the fleet. Will you, my dear Miss Howard, pardon my impatience, if I wish to call you mine before these orders arrive. I shall have a thousand doubts and fears if I leave you before we are irrevocably united. Perhaps some one more worthy; Oh! forgive my suspicions, but who can love and not fear to lose the object of their fondest hopes. Methinks could I once call you mine, the thought would inspire me with courage. Should I be called into action against the enemy of my country, honour, ambition, thirst of fame should all give way to love. For you alone would I fight, for your sake alone wish to conquer, and your love should be the reward of all my toils. I will spend an hour with you to-morrow evening. Oh! my sweet friend, let your mild eyes tell me, at meeting, you cannot refuse the ardent prayer of your ever faithful FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVIII. MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.) But I did refuse him, Celia, tho' my little rebellious heart would have fain played the traitor. Be still, little fool, said I, Meriel will learn to be thy mistress: think not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to counteract resolutions which reason tells me are right and laudable. So, my dear girl, I persevered in the determination of not giving Rainsforth my hand, till the summer's cruise was over, and he was obliged to submit with as good a grace as he could, tho' I assure you, he looked quite blank upon it. And now, my dear girl, I will give you my reasons for thus obstinately opposing the proposed union. You know I shall be eighteen in September, when being mistress of my fortune, I may dispose of it as I have already designed, without being answerable to any one. Now, if I marry first, I certainly make my husband master, not only of myself, but of all I possess; and how do I know what objections may arise on his part in the course of a few months. I do not mean, that I doubt Rainsforth's generosity; but a change of circumstances produces a change of ideas, and I think it is best not to trust too much to the firmness of our own hearts. My aunt laughed the other day, and said she questioned if I should ever be married, for absence and salt water are in general a cure for love. It may prove so with some, but I do not much fear the constancy of a man, who braves even the shaft of ridicule, by openly avowing me the woman of his choice; for I can see many a sneering smile, glance from my aunt to her son, whenever they are witness to his attention to your Meriel. My father and mother seem totally regardless, whether I am married now, or when he returns; and I believe, if the truth was known, are very little concerned about my future welfare. But yet, Celia, my bosom cannot forget its natural affections, or divest itself of those strong sensations of duty, love and veneration, which ever have warmed it, since my infant tongue first lisp'd the tender name of mother. As to my father, I cannot say I feel any emotions in his favour, nor can it be expected I should, after the scenes which I have imparted to you, the horrors of which will never be removed from my mind. Alas! they often recur to my imagination and cast a gloom over every rising pleasure. Yet, as a man whose happiness is nearly connected with my mother's; as the man whom nature requires me to regard, I will pay him every necessary respect, and as far as the narrow limits of my power will permit, will promote his interest and felicity. May 19th. Celia, he is gone; I have this moment bade him farewell. I feel there are moments when all the fortitude, we boast, sinks into nothing opposed to the struggles of nature; would you believe it, at the moment when I saw him step into the chaise, I would have given worlds, had I possessed them, to have been his wife, that I might have gone with him, beheld him to the very last moment of embarkation, and even then have stood on the shore to catch a last look at the expanded sails which bore him from me, till by degrees they lessened to my view, and at length were lost in the vast horizon. My aunt and cousins where with us drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I instantly saw something was the matter. The order is at length arrived, said I, mentally, Vol. I. N and he comes to bid me adieu; I handed him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but did not taste it. “I am come Miss Howard,” said he, “to take my leave; the fleet sails in a few days.” “Do you go this evening,” said my mother. “In a few moments, madam,” said he, “I just recieved the letter, and accidently met with two brother officers, who were going in a chaise, and gladly accepted me as a third; we mean to take two stages to night, and shall be in Portsmouth by to-morrow noon.” At that moment the chaise stopped at the door. Rainsforth rose, bowed to my aunt and cousins, thanked them for all civilities, wished my father and mother health, and then turned toward me. My heart was full, so was his; we neither of us spoke; he pressed my hands to his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions, and was in the chaise in an instant. I knew sensibility would be deemed weakness by those who were witness to our parting; I therefore struggled to suppress my rising tears, offered up a silent prayer for his safe return, and endeavoured at a look of composure, that was very foreign to my heart. What may be his fate, heaven alone can tell; yet sure if worth is its peculiar care, he will not only be protected in this, but in every other danger. But alas! Celia, how often do we see merit cut off in its full prime, whilst the unworthy are spared. Surely, when the brave and good fall in their country's cause, it must be that their virtues merit such rewards as only heaven can give. They are suffered to appear on the vast theatre of life, to act a little while bright shining parts, and then are called home to receive the glorious mead of heavenly and unceasing joys. My mind dwelling on this subject the other evening, (you know I am fond of indulging in little effusions of poetry,) and painting to myself the situation of a soldier's wife, who has followed her husband to the very scene of battle, and in the morn, sending him forth to brave the hostile foe, at night sees him covered with wounds and in the agonies of death; I for a moment fancied myself in her situation, and wrote the following trifle. I send it to my Celia without an apology, because trifles become valuable when they proceed from the friend we love. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANNA. (Enclosed in the foregoing.) THE day was past, the ensanguin'd plain, O'erspread with many a valiant hero slain; When Anna to her breast her infant caught, And 'mongst the slaughter'd heaps her Henry sought. The pale moon shed a feeble ray of light, Which added to the horrors of the night. Trembling with anguish and despair, To heaven she thus address'd her pray'r. Just power, who saw my Henry fall, Conduct me where he lies, And let me bath his wounds in tears, And let me seal his eyes. This morn, when he went forth, I pray'd No evil might betide him, But since he fell, oh guide me where, And let me die beside him. Henry tho' dying knew his Anna's voice, Cried, “dry those tears, my Anna and rejoice; For tho' I'm lost to thee, yet future story, Shall tell, thy Henry liv'd and died with glory. And teach my boy the road to fame,” he cried, “Farewell!” then faintly graspt her hand and died. Weeping she knelt and kissed the breathless clay, And vow'd his last injunctions to obey. Yes matchless youth, tho' lost to me, By hope inspir'd, in thought I see On glory's wings thy spirit rise, And angles waft it to the skies. I'll tell my son his father's deeds, And tho' my heart with anguish bleeds, I'll teach his soul, like thine to soar, And mark the path thou'st trod before. Then tho' like thee, he yields his breath, I'll glory in my hero's death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">N 2 LETTER XIX. MERIEL to CELIA. London, July 20th, 1776. This brother of mine is a sad lad. He will not be content to remain where he has been placed, but has taken it into his wise head that he must go to sea; nothing else will suit him, he cannot, he says, be confined to the drudgery of a counting-hou?e, where a person may toil all their lives and rise to nothing above mediocrity. He will go to sea, where, with one bold push, it often happens that a man gains both honour and fortune. The lad seems to be possessed of the spirit of ambition, yet not that laudable ambition which acts as a stimulus to actions great and praise worthy. It is power and wealth he aims at, and be the steps ever so dirty, by which he must arrive at the desired eminence, I much fear he would not hesitate to wade thro' thick and thin. However, as that is his fixed determination, I must e'en be content with the lost of the apprentice fee, tho' here is a fresh source of expense in fitting him out as a midshipman, for in that situation I find he can be admitted on board the ship where Rainsforth is lieutenant. I wish to my soul an intimate acquaintance with this worthy man, may be of service to him, for we often insensibly imbibe the sentiments of those with whom we associate. My father, I fear, is running into his old errors; he has formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no good. Dell appears much of the gentleman in his manner, but young Mossop says he is a prosessed gambler, and I am rather inclined to believe this assertion, as my father is frequently out with him till three or four in the morning, and has drained us so of money, that we have not a single guinea for house expences; this will occasion our getting into debt, and I am afraid my father has already borrowed money on the strength of my promise, in regard to my fortune; if so all my endeavours to preserve my mother from want will be ineffectual. This Dell has a wife, whom he once brought to spend an afternoon with us; I do not like her; there was something in her dress and manner, bold, forward and disgusting; she has been pretty, and is vain enough to think she is so now. My mother does not admire her any more than myself, and only that she thinks it would highly disoblige my father, she would by no means either recieve or return her visits. Another source of unhappiness to this dear suffering woman is my father's giving way to a habit of drinking, for he is almost continually intoxicated, and so extremely captious and ill natured that it is next to impossible to say or do any thing to please him. Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for your afflictions; how many years have you past wherein you can scarcely say, you have seen one happy hour; and could I, but lead you to repose your sorrows on the bosom of your child! but no, you think that child unworthy of your love, unworthy your confidence; and she dares not clear herself, lest by endeavouring to remove one sorrow from your heart, she should throw another on it that would crush you with its weight. I have heard from Rainsforth but once since the fleet sailed. Oh! Celia, should he one day afflict my heart, by harshness, cruelty or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the thought thus wrings my bosom, what would the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour to bear it with the meekness of a wife, and the fortitude of a christian; but me thinks I would wish to sink at once under the dreadful certainty; doubt and suspicion would torture me to the very utmost of my strength to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived his affection, must, I am convinced, be instant death or madness. My letters have now nothing interesting in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think every thing insipid and tiresome, that is not concerning Rainsforth; even reading no more amuses. If I read of a worthy character, such a one I cry is my Frederic; then I drop the book to muse upon his virtues, and if I take up my pen I can write but an invocation to heaven for his safety. The only relief I find is in constant employment, and therefore, I seldom pass an idle hour, my needle, my pencil, and my domestic concerns, pleasingly variegate the scene, and prevent my complaining of lassitude. I go out but little, and see but few visitors, my cousins indeed frequently call, but as I do not mix in the same gay circles they do, I can join but little in their conversation; they tell me many lively anecdotes that amuse me; I listen to their account of a ball, a concert, or any other fashionable amusement with a smile, because it gives me pleasure to see them happy. My mother says they give me these accounts only to mortify me; if so, they greatly miss their aim; I feel no inclination to mix in the giddy throng of the votaries to pleasure. Nature never designed me for dress, bustle, and parade; my highest wish is to steal thro' life unnoticed, but by the friends I love, and to die before I know their loss or the privation of their esteem. Adieu, my Celia. In your prayers remember the beloved of your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XX. MERIEL to CELIA. London, November 17th, 1776. Celia, you are happy. You never formed a wish beyond the narrow bounds prescribed by your monastic rules. Your heart never vibrated with love, with hope, with sensations undescribably pleasing, when the object of that love returned in safety from the boisterous elements, and still more dreadful fury of enemies. And is it, do you ask, a happiness to be deprived of those sweet sensations? Yes, my friend it is; for then you cannot suffer the keen pang, which at this moment rends the heart of your friend. Read the enclosed, which I have just received, and tell me if you do not pity your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXI. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD, (Enclosed in the preceding.) Plymouth, November 13th, 1776. Will my dear Meriel believe that it is with pain I take up my pen to address her; that I am at loss for words, yet ardently long to pour out my soul before her. I have braved the perils of the sea, my love, I am safe arrived at my destined port, but not within sight of happiness. Alas! that golden dream which has buoyed me up, and cheered me whilst absent from all my soul held dear, is vanished. The lovely prize which I thought would have rewarded all my hardships, is wrested from me. Oh! beloved Meriel, I am lost, forlorn, and wretched. You never can be mine, Meriel: never! Oh my heart, yet hold a little, burst not till I have told my gentle love, how much this resignation costs me. But I am a beggar, and shall I marry thee, my dearest girl, and bring a wretched race of innocents into a life of penury and woe. Shall I lead my gentle Meriel to the altar, when I am certain our only patrimony will be want and misery. Oh no! humanity! honor! love! forbid it. My father is a bankrupt, nor has he saved enough from the wreck of his fortune to support even for a few months, his wife and three small children: and shall not I, who received from him life, education, every valuable gift: shall not I prefer his happiness to my own? Yes, my adored Meriel, I will, dear as thou art to this fond doating heart; I will renounce even thee, and devote my little income to the support of my father and his family. Adieu my sweet love, may balmy peace, with healing on her wing descend to thy lovely bosom, mayest thou, (for it will be necessary to thy peace) banish the hapless Rainsforth from my mind; or think only of him as one lost to thee, the world, and to himself. And may you, with some happier, worthier youth, find every blessing, every earthly comfort: but be assured, whilst I retain the least trace of memory, you, and you only, shall possess the affections of my heart. Vol. I. O Whilst life remains you will be the dearest object of my fond wishes; and when called from this transitory scene, my last breath will be spent in a prayer for your happiness. Adieu, dear amiable Miss Howard: may the choicest gifts of heaven be showered on you. Oh! how my heart bleeds while I write. Beloved of my soul, farewell forever. FREDERIC RAINSFORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXII. MISS HOWARD TO MR. RAINSFORTH. London, November 16th, 1776. “Adieu, forever,” did you say: no, Rainsforth, no! we shall yet meet many times, our souls are congenial; they were animated the by same spark of intellectual fire, and tho' we cannot claim a nearer tie, we shall be friends to the latest hour of our existence. My generous, noble friend, I do not blush to say my esteem, (nay call it love, if you will) is increased by this proof of your magnanimity; call it not a resignation, I am your's I will never be another's; unless I can find one your superior in every virtue, that can exalt and dignify human nature, and in saying that, I think I am irrevocably bound to you. There may be men who possess equal goodness of heart, but there can be none who can boast a superiority. I am sensibly affected at your father's misfortunes; would to heaven it was in my power to remove every affliction far from him. Not so much from the idea that his troubles have interrupted my happiness; but that I am certain your feeling heart suffers those misfortunes doubly, in seeing them inflicted on one so deservedly dear to you. But let us look forward my friend; the prospect is not so dark, but that the sun of prosperity may yet brake forth to enliven it; you may yet live to see your father reinstated in the afluence, from which he is at present removed by an all-wife Providence, only to teach him the value of past blessings. We never know rightly, how to prize a benefit, till we have known what it is to lose it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew not half your worth till the very moment that I saw an insuperable barrier placed between us, and now I wish I had listened to your solicitations, for then at this moment I might have administered comfort to your drooping spirits, and assisted in the delightful task of soothing the sorrows of your parents. But why should I be so selfish, the pleasure would have been all my own; for sure I knew your generous heart too well, to suppose it would not have suffered from the idea of my sharing in afflictions, which could not have been prevented, and hardly admit of any aleviation. To say I felt nothing when I read your pathetic letter, would be to pronounce myself insensible. Believe me, I felt all; nay, perhaps more than you could have wished; however, of this be assured, that nothing but a total change in you can occation any alteration in my sentiments. If it will be more conducive to your happiness; here let the correspondence cease, and should you hereafter meet a woman, whose merits and fortune render her worthy your attachment; may you be as happy in the union as the lot of mortallity will allow. Adieu, every kind wish of my heart is your's. MERIEL HOWARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIII.[1] [1] Between this and the foregoing letter, there are several omitted, which passed between Miss Howard and her friend. As they contained nothing but complaints of Mr. Howard's behaviour, and an account of young Howard's going to India, on a three year's station. This occasions a space of eighteen months. MERIEL to CELIA. London, May 6th, 1778. It is in vain to strive against fate. My father is resolved not to pause in his career of folly, till we are all involved in ruin. 2 O The money I presented to my mother, when I took possession of my fortune, is all mouldered away, and even the little capital I had reserved for myself, broke in upon. I know you will say I am pursuing my notions of filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am, and yet, my dear Celia, were you situated as I am, I so well know your heart, that I am certain you would have conducted yourself exactly in the same manner. About three days since, a gentleman called and presented a bill for payment, drawn by my brother, who had given my mother notice of his design; but she, fearful of mentioning it, as she had no means of answering the demand, had kept it to herself. It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous lad! when he knew how narrow our circumstances were, and how much his inconsistent conduct had embarrassed us. When the man brought the bill, my poor mother turned pale as ashes. “What is the matter, madam,” said I. She called me into the next room, and putting the bill into my hand, (for it was some days after sight) she said, “what must I do.” “Indeed my dear madam,” I replied, “I cannot tell. It is not in my power to do any more, the bill must be protested, and I hope it will teach him frugality in future. I am sure he must have been very extravagant, or he never could have wanted money so soon, considering the sum he took with him.” She made me no answer, but bursting into tears cried, “then all is over, my poor Richard.” I never can see my mother in affliction, but my heart yearns spontaniously to fly to her relief. How then could I behold her tears unmoved, how hold back that comfort she required, when she thus continued to address me. “I know, Meriel, we have almost reduced you to beggary, I am fully sensible how much we owe to your generosity.” “Dear, dear mother, talk not so,” said I, throwing my arms about her, “I have done nothing but my duty, and I think it still my duty to preserve the remainder of my fortune, to comfort you in your declining age.” “But think of your brother, Meriel,” cried she eagerly, “think my dear girl, what straits he may reduced to in a foreign land. If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be thrown into prison, and be lost for want of a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel, refuse not your mother this one request.” And ah! my Celia, may I never meet such another trial. The dear woman knelt; yes, my mother knelt to me before I had the time or power to prevent her. “Good heavens!” said I, “this is too much, take me, dear mother, do with me and mine as you think proper, only I beseech you do not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I should have knelt to you, oh! rise, and do not thus distress me. I will pay the bill.” The next day I took up money sufficient for that purpose, and also to discharge some sew debts in the neighbourhood, so that our income is now so reduced that I must be obliged to turn my thoughts towards some genteel employment, however repugnant it is to my father and mother's inclinations. In my opinion, the person who has talents, health and spirits to earn a subsistence, is in all respects independent, and there is nothing to me would be more painful, than to eat the bread of indolence. Pride may teach another lesson, but then it is not the pride which elevates the human heart. It shall be ever my pride to keep free from obligation. It is always a painful sense, but more especially when we have no power to return it. Let my habitation be ever so humble, and my fare ever so coarse, if they are the fruits of my own industry, they will be sweeter, more comfortable by far, than the greatest luxuries purchased by the cringe of servility. May 7th. Rejoice with me, my dear Celia, the prospect once more brightens. I yesterday received the following letter from Rainsforth. TO MISS HOWARD. MY ever loved, my constant Meriel will, I am certain, rejoice to hear that my father is again restored to affluence. A distant relation, lately dead, has bequeathed the whole of his wealth, which is very considerable, to our family. To me he has given five thousand pounds. Then let me hasten to bid my beloved Meriel be prepared to see me; for this day week, I will come to demand her long promised hand, and seal myself before the altar, her's eternally. FREDERIC RAINSFORTH. And shall I now ever dare to complain of past trials, my Celia? has not this proof of his love and constancy endeared him more than ever to my heart? Oh my friend, my spirits are so agitated, I cannot write or speak with any coherence, I must throw aside my pen and endeavour to compose my thoughts. My cousin Hester has just left me. I shewed her Rainsforth's letter in the fullness of my heart, and claimed her promise of being bride maid. I thought she did not look pleased and hurried away very soon after she had read the letter. I shall make but little preparation against his arrival. I know he regards me only for myself, and alas! that is all I now have to bestow. Two days more and I shall see him; think me not weak, if I tell you I shall count the hours with impatience. After a seperation of near two years, how pleasing to meet a friend whom we know to be so worthy, and whom we had given up as lost. Farewell, my dear Celia, your pleasures are all of the calm unruffled kind, like the smooth stream that glides beneath a lofty bank, by which it is defended from the rude blasts of wind. It continues one gentle unvaried course, and its charms can neither be increased or diminished. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIV. MERIEL to CELIA. London, May 19th, 1778. I have expected morning after morning with hope, and each day as it arrived brought with it only disappointment. I will decieve myself no longer, nothing but death, or extreme illness could have kept him from me, tho' I have been told that he meant from the first to decieve me, and that my easy fondness has been a theme for ridcule for him and his gay companions. But I cannot believe it, Celia, if he is false, where shall we find a man worthy to be esteemed. No, Rainsforth, there certainly must be some very urgent cause for this absence, this, I had almost said, cruel silence; but I will not give up the opinion I have formed of your integrity. May 20th. Celia, I am ill, very ill, my heart has recieved a shock it will never recover; Rainsforth is married! married to another, and within a fortnight after the day appointed to unite him to me. My cousin Hester called on me yesterday to take a walk; we called on a lady of her acquaintance who has a sister married at Plymouth, for Hester suggested that through her means we might gain some intelligence concerning Rainsforth. After the usual ceremonies, when we were seated, Hester enquired when she had heard from her sister, “I had a letter yesterday,” she replied, “Kitty has been very gay, I assure you, they have had great doings at Plymouth, Miss Kingly, the great heiress, was married last Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding.” “And pray who is she married to?” said Hester. “A young officer in the navy,” she replied, “whom she has been fond of for some time; I really forget his name, but there is the letter, you may read the whole account.” I do not know how I supported myself, while I cast my eye over the letter, as my cousin held it in her hand, but I caught the name of Rainsforth; my head grew giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the exertion of my resolution avoided making myself ridiculous. “Upon my word,” cousin, said Hester without any regard to my feelings, in exposing me to a stranger, “upon my word, this is very unaccountable.” “Why pray,” said the lady, “is it the Mr. Rainsforth I have seen so often with you Miss Mossop?” “The very same, and will you believe it, he was under a promise of marriage to my cousin here; do you not think it very scandalous behaviour?” “Scandalous indeed: if I was in Miss Howard's place I would sue him for half his wife's fortune.” “I shall not give either myself or him that trouble, madam, (I replied with as much composure as I could assume,) I think since he has proved himself of so fickle a nature, he has done me a favour rather than an injury, as it would have been much more painful to me to lose the affection of a husband than a lover. Pride my dear madam added I with a forced smile) keeps up our spirits on these occasions.” I returned home from this visit with a heavy heart, but still flattered myself there might be some mistake; but the receipt of the letter I inclose for your perusal has removed every doubt.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXV. MR RAINSFORTH SEN. to MISS HOWARD. Plymouth, May 17th, 1778. MADAM, Looking over some papers which were lately in possession of my son, I found some letters which I think proper to return to you; and am very sorry if any thing has passed between you that may occasion you future uneasiness. I am obliged to you for the very generous sentiments expressed in those letters, towards my whole family, and beg leave to inform you, that your kind wishes, respecting my son's happiness, are amply fulfilled, as he was yesterday married to a very amiable woman, possessing a fortune of twenty thousand pounds. I am, madam, your humble servant, F. RAINSFORTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.) WITH this letter, my dear Celia, came a parcel containing all the letters I had ever wrote to Rainsforth; and believe me, the unfeeling tenor of his father's letter did not hurt me half so much, as the idea of his cruelty, in suffering his father first to peruse, and then return them; my pride was alarmed, my sensibility shocked! a man in whom I placed such implicit confidence; one whom I thought endowed with every virtue. Celia, I feel a painful void in my heart; I feel that I shall never again place a confidence in any man. My cousin Hester has frequently told me, that Rainsforth was decietful, that he A 2 saw my partiality and played upon it, merely for his own diversion; but I always doubted; nay, to such a height was my enthusiasm raised, I could not have believed it possible for one who wore so fair a semblance of virtue, to be so very false, so unaccountably wanton in his cruelty towards an inoffensive girl, whose whole soul was absorbed in one affectionate wish for his felicity: why, when I had taught my heart to resign him without a murmur; why, when the first hard trial was past, and every hope was extinguished, did he seek to awaken a passion, which, tho' reason had in some measure repelled its violence, was still tender, still ardent in my bosom. Oh! my friend, had he without renewing the correspondence which we had mutually agreed to drop, given his hand to Miss Kingly, I should not have complained; no, my Celia, so pure was my love, that I should have exulted in his felicity, and whilst I thought him worthy of every blessing, have rejoiced to see them placed within his reach. But alas! he is not worthy, and perhaps this poor gentle affectionate girl, for such I am told she is, may soon experience a change in his sentiments, when she has neither the power to leave him, nor liberty to complain of his conduct. May 20th. I begin to be more composed; I am resolved to despise the whole sex; they may wear a semblance of virtue, but the reality of it is foreign to their hearts. Every occurrence of life will be now equally indifferent to me; I have vowed to devote myself to my mother while she lives, and whenever heaven pleases to call her away, my incessant prayer shall be soon to follow; I do not wish to go before her, because, I see her only hope of support must proceed from me; and unboundedly grateful will be my heart, if by any means whatever I can preserve her from misery. May 29th. It was certainly a wise dispensation of Providence, that prevented my union with Rainsforth; had I been separated from my dear mother, where now would she have found a comforter. My father is in prison Celia; my whole fortune is expended; but thank heaven, I have still health and strength to work. I live in a miserable apartment in the Fleet prison, I sit lost as it were to every thing but misery; but yet, my dear Celia, I can look up to heaven with gratitude; I am not a wife, I am not a mother, I feel not the strong chords of maternal affection twining round my heart, and wringing it with unutterable anguish; I might have been more wretched than I am: and whilst I can say that, let me express only gratitude towards the great Ruler of the universe, who has not tried me beyond my strength to support. Can you think, my friend, that in this miserable situation I have yet one ray of comfort breaks on my benighted soul; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother is at length convinced, that my love, my dutiful attentions, are the result of the feelings of my heart. On me alone she now rests; to me alone looks for comfort; her eyes once more beam on me with affection; her heart again is lift up to heaven for my felicity; and who my dear friend, who that knows the just value of maternal love, would not gladly resign wealth, nay almost every consideration, to enjoy so inestimable a blessing. I cannot at this time give you particulars; indeed, I know not why I should write to you at all, for sure my letters convey no pleasure to your friendly bosom, but I cannot give up the greatest pleasure of my life, unless you expressly desire it. To you I can unfold my thoughts; to you, tell the sorrows of my heart; and as I write, fond fancy represents you as feeling for my afflictions: I see the tear of sympathy tremble in your eye; I hear the soft cheering voice of consolation break from your lips: I am soothed; I am comforted by the thought: surely, my Celia, will not refuse, this almost only consolation to her afflicted MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVI. MERIEL to CELIA. Fleet prison, June 10th, 1778. I have now sat down, to give you the particulars of a scene, which, when I last wrote, I could not command sufficient composure to deleniate. I had been out one afternoon on particular business; indeed to look after some employment, whereby I might conduce to the support of the family. On my return I found my mother weeping over a bit of paper, which she held in her hand. I enquired the cause. She gave me the paper, and I read on it, “Barwell, Sheriff's officer, Carey-street.” “Your father is arrested, Meriel,” said she. “Gracious heaven!” said I, “then we are all ruined: but what is the sum; at whose suit is he arrested.” “At the suit of that villain Dell,” she replied, “for fifty pounds, which he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming table; he also threatens him with a prosecution for a criminal correspondence with his wife. Oh heavens!” continued she, redoubling her tears, “when shall I die and be at peace.” It was in vain to offer consolation. I did not even attempt it, but resolved, if possible, to see if any thing could be done, either to ward off the impending blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties attending it. I went immediately to an attorney, made him acquainted with the case, and requested his advice. He told me there was no redress, that the money must be paid, and in case of the prosecution, it was most likely he would be cast with damages. This intelligence was an additional weight upon my spirits. However, I proceeded to Careystreet, where I found this thoughtless father surrounded by unfortunate men of the lowest class, with a bowl of punch before him, and in the very act of singing a drinking song. When he saw me, he looked abashed. I asked if I coud speak to him in another room, for my soul shrunk from the society of those unhappy beings, with whom he seemed so pleased. When we were accommodated with another apartment, I asked him, how this debt was contracted, and by what means he meant to discharge it. I cannot repeat to you the answer he made; it was so replete with contradiction, that I had scarcely patience to hear him out. When he had finished, I enquired, if that debt was paid, were there no others of the same sort. “Consider sir,” said I, “it will not be long I shall have it in my power to answer these demands, and when my money is entirely expended, where is my dear mother to find support.” “Ah Meriel,” said he, “you are always more anxious about her than me, you don't care what becomes of your father.” “I should think, sir,” said I with some warmth, “that I had given sufficient proof of my attention to the happiness of both. I am sorry to use any language to a father, which may be deemed improper; but I must say, had you paid as much attention to your own happiness as was undoubtedly your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all which have fallen upon our family, might have been avoided. I will pay this money sir, and I hope you will not think I take too great a liberty if I advise you, hereafter to shun such unworthy acquaintance as Dell, and strive rather to obtain some genteel employment, by which these kind of scenes may in future be avoided. “You talk like a very unfeeling girl, Meriel,” said he. “Do you imagine then it is so easy for a man, born and brought up a gentleman, to submit to the drudgery of servitude: no Miss; if your ideas are so mean, mine are not, I will starve first, and would rather see you starve than have my family disgraced by your following any servile, mean employment.” Believe me, Celia, when he uttered these sentiments, I felt so irritated by his foolish pride, that had not the idea of my suffering mother at that moment obtruded on my mind, I should have left him to his fate. However, I stifled my rising anger, and having given him a draught on my banker to discharge the arrest, returned to console my mother. When I entered, I was surprised to see her grief more violent than ever. She was wringing her hands and weeping with great bitterness. After many fruitless enquiries concerning this fresh torrent of sorrow, I learnt that Mr. Lesage, the banker, with whom I had placed the trifling remnant of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt. To describe my feelings is impossible. However I saw my mother wanted comfort, and I exerted my utmost power to stifle emotions, which if indulged, would only serve to increase her anguish. “We must go to prison,” said she, “we must all go to prison, and who is to support us there?” “Providence, my dear mother,” said I, “We will place our hopes on that benign power, who never forsakes those, who, in full confidence of support, exert their utmost abilities and rely on him only for success. Come, come, chear up, thank God, I am healthy and able to work.” She gazed on me for a moment; then throwing her arms round me, she cried, “oh! my child, I will doubt your virtue no longer; your heart must be pure, or you could not thus rely on heaven for support; but oh! my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart severely to see you obliged to labour for subsistence.” “Do not think of it,” said I; “let me see you but tolerably happy and I shall not regret any hardship, however severe: I will never leave you, my beloved mother; only let me be once more called the child of your affection, and I shall think myself completely rewarded for every suffering it may please heaven to inflict.” A few days after this, my father was removed to this miserable place: we sold the best part Vol. II. B of our furniture and cloaths to discharge the debts owing among our trades people. My mother then came to my father: I do not sleep in the prison, but come here every morning; I perform all their domestic offices, go out for their provision, &amp;c. but as yet, have not been able to procure any work. Indeed, I had hope of being employed by an embroiderer, but on being asked to give security, for the safety of whatever work I might be entrusted with; I unfortunately happened to mention, being related to Mr. Mossop's family; of course, the master of the shop applied to my aunt for my character. Celia, this aunt denied any knowledge of me, said she had no relation who was in circumstances to want employment of that kind, that she had some knowledge of a young woman of the name of Howard, she believed, I might be very honest but I was certainly no relation of her's. Thus my dear girl, was my laudable design frustrated; for the man naturally enough observed if I could be guilty of telling a lie; I might be capable of worse actions. I hope, however, in a short time to procure something to do; for our little stock of money diminishes very fast. August 15th, 1778. Of all the scenes through which we are doomed to pass, sure none is so truly painful, as that of being witness to the death of those whom nature has placed in a near relation to us; whom, spite of all their errors, we cannot wholly divest our hearts of tenderness for; and to see them approach the awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind, that renders all offered comfort ineffectual, to calm their doubts and fears, when the retrospect of their past lives fills them only with horror; and the idea of futurity brings nothing but despair. Such a scene I have lately past; my father is no more: he is I hope at peace; to think otherwise would be an agony too great to bear: poor man, to the very last he was addicted to the fatal errors that had undone him. Few were the hours he spent in the apartment with my mother, being chiefly at a place, which they call the tap, where he could drown his care, as he vainly imagined, and where he was frequently drawn in to play cards, tho' sometimes for the last six-pence he had in his pocket. One evening, at this place he quarrelled with his antagonist, and high words ensued; from words they went to blows, and my father recieved a stroke on his temple, which leveled him with the ground. He fell with the back of his head against an iron fender which cut him severely and fractured the skull; all assistance was vain; he languished four days, in all the complicated agonies of pain of body and distress of mind; tho' I flatter myself he had some internal comfort in his last moments, as he seemed more composed for about two hours before his death. He earnestly requested forgiveness of both my mother and myself, for the manifold injuries he had done us; but to my great comfort, mentioned no particulars: he also made a declaration before witnesses that the man who struck the unfortunate blow, was entirely guiltless of intentional malice, as he had been the first aggressor himself; and the fall was entirely accidental. He expressed a wish to see his sister; in compliance with his earnest desire I went to her, told her of the melancholy accident, and earnestly requested she would visit my dying father. “Upon my word Meriel,” said she, “I am extremely sorry for this shocking affair; but you know child my seeing him will be of no use; it will only be hurting my own feelings, with out being of the least service to your father. I never can bear scenes of this kind; my sensibility is so exquisite, that, was I to see my poor brother in this situation, I should not recover it for a month. Ah! poor man, he was always getting into some mischief or other; he never prospered in any thing after his marriage with your mother.” “You cannot suppose, madam, that the want of prosperity was to be attributed to that union.” “Why, I don't know, Meriel, my brother never loved your mother, but was artfully drawn in.” “By whom, madam?” “By your grand mother, Miss, who wished to get a good settlement for her daughter. Your mother too, pretended such a violent affection for him, that he could not refuse some little return of kindness, and they never ceased their arts till they had noosed him fast.” “You talk in riddles, madam, my mother brought my father a genteel fortune.” “It was nothing, Miss, to the fortune he might have expected, if he had not offended his father; I always said no good would come of the match.” “It is much to be wished, indeed, madam,” said I, “that such a union never had taken place; it would have spared my dear mother many B 2 years of severe anguish, and my unfortunate self would never have seen the light.” As I said this my heart was so oppressed I could not refrain my tears. “Bless me! my dear,” said Mrs. Mossop, in an affected accent of kindness; “I did not mean to vex you, you are not to be blamed for your parents faults.” “If they have faults, madam,” said I, “be assured I wish not to hear of them; it would be a painful topic at any time, but pardon me, if I say, at this particular season, it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to visit a brother, who is poor and dying in prison. I should think, had he millions of faults, at this moment they would be all forgotten; that you would remember only his afflictions, and that he was your brother.” I spoke this with some warmth; my aunt hesitated for an answer; at length she told me she would come the next morning. “It will be too late, madam,” said I, “it is thought he cannot live the night out.” “Dear, dear,” she replied, “it is so unfortunate that I have a large party coming this afternoon, but if they leave me in any tolerable season”—I would hear no more, but turning from her with a mixture of contempt and pity, I returned to the habitation of mourning and death. When I entered the room, my father enquired eagerly if she would come; I thought it would be wrong to disturb his last moments, with an account of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only told him, she was not able to come that evening, but would be there early in the morning. “It will be too late then,” said he, “I must write to her.” It was in vain we remonstrated; he would be raised in the bed, with a design to write; but his head would not permit him to trace even a single letter: he was seized with faintings and when he recovered seemed to have forgot his design. He spoke but little afterwards, was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he frequently cried out in agony, “'tis all in vain, I cannot be forgiven.” A worthy well disposed clergyman prayed besided him, and said a great deal to compose him, and calm his doubts. It had in some measure the desired effect: and about four o'clock in the morning, he resigned his soul into the hand of Him who gave it. My mother's sorrow is not to be described. All thought of our dreadful, desolate situation was entirely absorbed in this heavy affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt her grief, as I thought, if suffered to take its natural course, time would meliorate a sorrow, which, any attempt at present to soften, would but increase. In the course of the next day, we expected my aunt to make the promised visit; but as the day passed without seeing her, in the evening my mother desired me to go to her again, and inform him of our loss. I went, but was suffered to wait near an hour, before she appeared; nor did my cousins come near me, tho' I heard them laughing and talking in the next room. Ah! said I, mentally, the afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they are left to indulge their own sad thoughts in solitude. Cruel Hester and Susan, had you been in affliction, would not I have abridged my own pleasures to comfort and console you. When my aunt entered the room she began; “realy Meriel I have not been able to visit my brother before; but now I have half an hour to spare, I will send for a coach, and we will go together.” “Your visit will no doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear madam,” said I, “but my father is no longer in a situation.”— “He is dead then,” cried she eagerly. I bowed my head in silence. “Well,” continued she, “I rather expected it, and I am much obliged to you for calling, to let me know, as I should have been greatly shocked to have found him dead, when I had called, as I certainly should, either this evening or to-morrow morning.” “My mother bid me ask your advice concerning the funeral madam, and not only your advice, but your assistance.” “Assistance, for what child?” “Could you advance us a little money?” “Money, Miss Howard! You astonish me; it is impossible you can be in want of money, when you came to possession of so handsome a fortune within these two years.” “I am very sorry madam, that you can suppose me capable of suffering my parents to languish in prison for fifty pounds, if I could have commanded such a sum.” “Why as to that Meriel, I thought you were acting like a prudent girl, and meant to take care of yourself; for I know you paid a great deal of money for your father, and might have continued so doing till you had ruined yourself.” “I should certainly have paid this last debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr. Lesage put it entirely out of my power.” “Oh I remember hearing, that you lost six hundred pounds by his failure, but you surely had a larger sum by you than that.” “Indeed aunt, that six hundred pounds was all the dependence I had in the world.” “Upon my word Meriel, I never was more astonished in my life. How have you contrived to run thro' all that money. Your mother and yourself must have been very extravagant, and when that is the case, nothing will save people from ruin. I am very sorry child, very sorry; but it is not in my power to help you; I have a large family, and the education of my daughters is expensive. As to my poor brother, why, my advice is, that you have him buried as privately, and with as little expense as possible. You will remember me to your mother; tell her I am really concerned at her trouble; but it is entirely out my power to help her, nor indeed, do I think it would be of any use; for was she releived from these difficulties, she would soon be involved by her imprudence, in others of the same sort.” When I repeated this conversation to my mother, she said, “it is no more than I expected, my dear child; but I let you go to make trial of her heart, that you might be convinced, how little dependence is to be placed on professions of friendship, made to us in our prosperity; and how little assistance is to be hoped from relations. We will sell every valuable of our cloaths and plate, to lay your father decently in the ground, and to pay the debt for which I now am become liable. It will, I am certain, leave us almost destitute; but when we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain employment of some kind or other, I will not mind how abject; for I would rather hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from strangers, than be subject to the unkindness of haughty, unfeeling relations.” This resolution was immediately executed, and when all expences were discharged, we found ourselves possessed of five guineas, some trifling household furniture, and the meanest of our cloaths. With these we left that abode of misery, the Fleet prison, and have taken a cheap lodging, on the Surry side of Blackfriars bridge. I have endeavoured to get some work, but as yet without effect; and what adds to my uneasiness, is, that my dear mother's health daily declines. As I have no other amusement, I spend a good deal of time at my pen. I have wrote several little poems, which I intend to correct and offer to some bookseller. Perhaps by that means, I may obtain something towards our subsistance. I feel a transient ray of hope dawn upon my mind. My mother smiling, tells me, I am too sanguine; but my dear Celia, I always was inclined to take the brightest side of the prospect, to hope for the best, and when disappointment arrives, to submit with as much patience as I can. I am what is generally termed a castle builder; it is a weakness (if it deserves the appellation) from which I derive amusement at least, and tho' I know at the very moment I am indulging those sanguine ideas, that my hopes have no more foundation, than the bubble blown from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I cannot help being pleased with the airy fabric of my own creating, and as soon as one vanishes, (to continue the allusion) I puff out another, and so prevent myself from becoming a prey to despair. And, believe me Celia, I consider this disposition, as one of the choicest gifts of heaven. Adieu my friend; may you be happier than your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVII. MERIEL to CELIA. London, December 5th, 1778. It is now some months since I have taken up my pen to address my dear Celia. Several times lately I have essayed to do it, but unable to bear a retrospect of my late heavy affliction, have from time to time, deferred the painful recital, till I begin to fear my dear friend will think I am either numbered with the dead, or become forgetful of her friendship. I have a long tale to tell my dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will steal many a tear from your eyes as you peruse it. In my last I informed you of my mother's ill health, and how unable we were to procure any proper advice or assistance. From that time her malady daily increased. I finished my little collection of poems and presented them to a bookseller; but he told me, I had mistaken my talents, and that the whole collection was Vol. II. C not worth a guinea. Disheartened and dispirited I returned to my mother, and now gave up my whole time to watching and attending her. Her disorder increased with such rapidity, that in the course of a few weeks she was consined to her bed. What a prospect had I now before me, a beloved parent sinking by slow degrees into the grave; when I had no method of procuring the comforts, and even the necessaries of life were denied. I had parted with all our apparel, except a change of linen, and had now past one whole day without food. My mother made no complaints; but her pale wan countenance, was to me a thousand times more affecting than unavailing exclamations. Our credit had been long lost in the neighbourhood, and I knew that in a few days we must inevitably perish for want. In this situation, I took a resolution to go out in the close of the evening and solicit the charity of the benevolent. I told my tale of sorrow to many of my own sex. They either heard me not, or disbelieved my assertions, and after sauntering through the streets near three hours, one cold wet night in October, I at length collected about six-pence, and with it having procured some trifling nourishment for my almost famished parent, I returned, allowing myself only a halfpenny roll. When I carried my little morsel to her bedside, she anxiously enquired how I had procured it. “Some charitable disposed person,” said I, “gave me the means; take it my mother, eat and be comforted.” Sinking nature required support; she eat the offered morsel, but seasoned it with tears of heartfelt anguish. The next day I determined again to try my new employment, and for that purpose wandered out towards the park. It was Sunday, the day was fine, I went in and seating myself on a bench, looked at the gay throng that crowded the mall, compared their situations with my own, and began to think myself the most unfortunate of human beings. I knew I had never deviated from the path of virtue; I had never committed any action deserving such abject misery, and I saw many women who had forfeited all claim to honour and respect, enjoying all the luxuries of life. At that moment reason, religion, integrity forsook me; and I wished myself in the same situation with those victims to vice, if by so doing, I could procure sustenance for my mother. You will, perhaps ask, my dear Celia, if we had no friends whatever, to whom we could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you know nothing of the world; those who have drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell, that poverty and friendship are utter strangers to each other. While I was indulging these painful reflections, an elderly gentlewoman, seated herself beside me, and viewing my person and dress with a scrutinizing eye, began some trifling discourse, and at length asked me, if I was born in London. From chatting at first on indifferent subjects, we began to remark the different appearances of the passing multitude. The old lady's remarks were just and pertinent; her discourse breathed the true spirit of philanthropy. I imagined I had found a friend, and without reserve unbosomed myself to her; related my story of past and present distress; she heard me with attention, and, me thought, I saw a gleam of compassion pass across her features. I seized the propitious moment, and in the humblest accent petitioned relief. “Poor child,” said she, “I believe your story to be true; innocence and simplicity, are indeliably marked upon your countenance; what is in my power I will do for you, tho' the means are but small.” She then drew forth her purse, and presented me with half a crown: it is only for those who have been in similar circumstances to concieve the tide of joy that rushed upon my heart at the possession of this little piece of silver; I eagerly kissed the hand that conveyed it to me, and would have spoke, but tears were the only thanks I could return; they were the sincerest, for they came warm from the heart. I left my seat with precipitation, and was preparing to return home; but my benefactress stopped me. “Miss Howard,” said she, “I believe I have it my power to serve you; meet me here again to-morrow.” I promised to meet her and returned to my mother with a heart lightened of half its sorrows. No doubt, said I, this lady will endeavour to extricate us from our present distress, and put us in some way of earning future subsistance. Elated with these hopes, I repaired next day to the appointed place; but after having waited two hours was obliged to return without seeing my benefactress. Something has detained her unexpectedly, said I, she will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but to-morrow passed as yesterday had done, and I was again disappointed. The third morning, tho' I had used the most rigid economy, I found myself again pennyless. C 2 However, spiritless and miserable as I was, I determined once more to repair to the park. My pace was slow, my looks dejected and my eyes streaming with tears. I had hardly proceeded half the length of the mall, when I heard myself called, and turning round perceived my benefactress. “My good girl,” said she, “I almost feared I should not meet you, I have been obliged to go into the country since I saw you, but I had not forgot you; come dry your eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will be your friend, if you mind how you behave yourself. He has sent you half a guinea; and if you will come this evening and sup at my house, in Soho square, I will introduce you to him.” “Alas! madam,” said I, “my appearance at your house will only disgrace you; nor can I suppose any gentleman will greatly interest himself in behalf of a poor unfortunate girl, without requiring a return which virtue and religion will not suffer me to make.” “Don't be foolish, child,” said the old lady, “virtue and religion are very pretty words; but pray tell me, will they keep your mother from starving.” “Oh! madam,” I replied, “will it not be worse than death to brand her name with infamy? Alas! I never could bear the scorn of the world, and the reproofs of my own conscience, oppressed with guilt and shame. Tempt me not, dear madam, to forsake the path of rectitude; let me retain my innocence, and come what may, I shall die in peace.” “This is fine talking, Miss Howard, but let me tell you, it is a very selfish way of arguing. You acknowledge, that the loss of virtue would make you unhappy. Are you not already unhappy in a superlative degree; and does that unhappiness in the least contribute to relieve your own or your mother's wants. No, does not the sight of your misery rather increase hers? Come, then, my dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of sorrow upon yourself, and save a parent, whom you tenderly love, from perishing with famine.” This was a strange way of arguing, Celia, yet it had the desired effect, I thought it was possible to hide my infamy from my mother, and confine my misery to my own bosom. When the old woman found my resolution began to waver, she plied me with sophistical arguments, described in glowing colours the gaiety and splendor in which many women of loose characters lived, and contrasted it strongly with my poor miserable apartment, where my sure attendants were pinching cold and hunger, and my only companion a beloved parent sinking under the complicated evils of sickness and famine. “Oh! save me! save me!” cried I eagerly, “from the dreadful thought, teach me how to snatch her from impending destruction, to administer support to her wasting frame, and comfort her declining hours. Do with me as you will; save, protect my dear mother, and let me be the only sacrifice.” Having brought me to this horrible resolution, and received my promise of coming to her house in the evening; she left me, and I repaired home; by the way procuring a bottle of wine and some other necessaries for my mother. She had been anxious at my long stay, and when I produced the refreshments, again enquired how I had purchased them. A lie, (the sirst I had ever told her) now suggested itself; I said I had performed a little work for a lady in the neighbourhood, and she had liberally rewarded me; but when I mentioned going out again in the evening, the pathetic manner in which she intreated me to guard my honour, as my only treasure, and as I wished to preserve her heart from breaking, almost staggered my resolution: but having given her some refreshment, I saw her spirits revive, and that by degrees she sunk into a sweet refreshing slumber. I determined to sacrifice every other consideration rather than see her reduced again to the extremity of misery she had so lately experienced. Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own sex, turn not from me with horror and contempt, consider my agonizing distress, glance with an eye of compassion over the dreadful resolution, and let a tear of pity blot the offence from your memories. Great and painful were the struggles of my soul, while gazing on my sleeping parent. I knelt by the bedside, and would have prayed, but, alas! that consolation was denied me. How could I address a Being of infinite purity, when I was going to offer myself a sacrifice at the shrine of guilt and pollution. I thought I should have sunk under the agonies I endured; once I wished for death, but then the thought of what my poor mother would suffer, immediately repelled the impious desire; at length, I clasped my hands and raising my eyes to heaven, cried, “Father of mercy direct me, oh! give me fortitude to bear thy dispensations as I ought, or pardon the weakness of an afflicted mortal.” I then kissed my sleeping mother, and with a heart almost broken repaired to Soho. The old woman received me cordially, but reproved my pensive countenance and swolen eyes; she made me drink some tea, and then taking me up stairs, insisted on my dressing myself in a brown lutestring nightgown, with a cap and linen suitable. We then went into an elegant parlour, and in a few moments Mr. Welldon was announced: he was a man upwards of thirty, of a comely person, polite address, and insinuating manner; he regarded me with visible attention, and when he spoke to me, it was with a mixture of respect and polite freedom. My feelings during supper were beyond description, poignant: I could scarcely restrain my tears, but the reproving looks of the old woman told me how much they would offend her: I therefore endeavoured to stisle my emotions; but when the cloth was removed and she arose to quit the room, I involuntarily caught her hand, and with a look which pleaded strongly for compassion burst into tears. “Why, what does the girl cry for?” said she sneeringly, “was it not by your own desire you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you must get the better of these pretty airs, tho' perhaps, indeed you may think her the more agreeable for them.” Then disengaging her hand from my grasp, she left the room. “Then I am inevitably lost,” cried I, clasping my hands in a wild agony, and redoubling my tears. “My sweet girl,” said Mr. Welldon, “this distress, which is too acute, to be construed into affectation, greatly suprises me. Was it not by your own free will that you came here to meet me?” “It was, it was,” said I, “but oh! sir, if you only knew the anguish it has cost me, to form the horrid design, you would pity me, indeed you would commiserate my sufferings.” “Dear creature,” said he, drawing his chair close to mine, “you know not how greatly your sorrow interests me; tell me, is there any thing within the compass of my fortune, can restore peace to your agitated bosom; say how can I serve you, how render you happy?” “Oh! there is one way, and only one way,” said I, “by which you can promote my happiness,” and I dropped on my knees before him. “Rise, rise, my dear girl,” said he, “and do not hesitate to point out this only way, by which I can prove myself your friend.” “This humliating posture best suits me,” I replied, “here will I remain till I move your heart to compassion: indeed I am not that vile creature you may perhaps think me. I always avoided the inticements of vice till this fatal night; but the miseries of a beloved parent, sinking to the grave, oppressed by sickness and poverty drove me to sacrifice my honour, to procure the means of prolonging her invaluable existence: if you are sincere in your professions of friendship, relieve my dear mother, and oh! I besceeh you, spare the virtue of her wretched daughter.” “Rise, then, my afflicted girl,” said he, “you shall be convinced of my sincerity; I will obey the dictates of humanity; we will instantly go to your mother.” He then left me for a few moments, when returning, he led me to a coach, and taking my direction, ordered the coachman to drive to our poor habitation. I hesitated at going away in the cloaths the old woman had made me put on, but my deliverer told me he had paid for them. When we arrived at our lodging, a mixed sensation of pain and pleasure dwelt upon my mind, and as I ran up stairs my limbs trembled so, they would scarce support me; Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened the door of the apartment, and rushing to the bedside, cried “see my dear mother, the friend which heaven hath sent us.” My poor mother raised herself feebly in the bed, looked first at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then pointing to my altered dress and crying “these are the wages of infamy, all but this I could have born patiently.” She fell back in a fit. I thought she was gone forever; frantic with despair, I tore off the dress which had so much alarmed her, and throwing myself on the bed beside her, vowed never more to rise, but that my life should expiate my intended offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for medical assistance, and entered the room with an apothecary, just as my mother gave some signs of returning life. Proper remedies were immediately applied and Mr. Welldon soon convinced my reviving parent, that I had not entailed infamy on her latter days, or hastened the period of her existence by guilt or shame. Vol. II. D Our generous benefactor, now supplied me with money, not only to procure every necessary, but every comfort of life; and engaged the apothecary to attend my mother every day: but his care was all in vain; her disorder daily gained ground, and I saw her end rapidly approaching. One day, when Mr. Welldon called to see us, my mother beckoned him to the bedside. “Sir,” said she, “if the prayers of a poor dying mortal are heard in heaven, you will undoubtedly be rewarded for your benevolence, towards a helpless widow and orphan. To your generosity I owe the honour of my child: oh! may she never again be tempted to doubt the care of a watchful providence; and to avoid a temporary evil, rush into lasting misery. To your care Mr. Welldon I commit her, poor and defenceless as she is; I do not fear your integrity; for the man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled passion could save an innocent creature from destruction, will never lay a deliberate plan for her seduction. Meriel, you must be humble and industrious, and trust heaven for support.” Mr. Welldon promised he would be my guardian and protector from every evil. “I place an implicit confidence in your word,” said my mother, “and shall die in peace.” “Oh! my dear Meriel,” continued she, faintly grasping my hand, “mayst thou be virtuous and happy, and may the Omnipotent preserve thee thro' life.” Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the moment that severed me from my dear mother will be always remembered as the most painful of my life. Adieu till I am more composed. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVIII. MERIEL to CELIA. December 25th, 1778. I again sit down to proceed in my melancholy narrative; a month from the time of my dear mother's death must be passed over in silence; my affliction was poignant, but time and the efforts of reason by degrees softened it. Mr. Welldon suffered that time to elapse before he ventuted to see me; he had placed me with a friend of his, who is a milliner, and tho' he sent every day to enquire after my health, he avoided visiting me, fearing the censure of the world might injure my reputation. My grief being in a great measure abated, Mrs. Lacour took an opportunity of speaking to me concerning my future prospects in life: “Mr. Welldon,” said she, “intends, if you approve the plan, that you shall remain with me till you have attained a competent knowledge of the millinery business, to be able to support yourself without being any longer troublesome to your benefactor. I know, Miss Howard,” continued she, “that Mr. Welldon does not think you an incumbrance, and that you are in no danger of any improper attempts from him; as I have heard him say the innate goodness of your heart has raised you so in his esteem, that he regards you in the light of a sister; and as such will serve and protect you: but my dear young lady, you are possessed of strong sensibility and to such a heart as your's dependance must be a heavy burthen. As another motive for your endeavouring to render yourself independent, I must inform you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks be married, and however innocent your mind, believe me the world will readily cast illiberal censures on a young woman who lived in a state of dependance on a married man; and should it reach his lady's ears might be the source of great uneasiness, if not the cause of an irreparable breach between them.” I was convinced of the propriety of these arguments, and chearfully acquiesced, while my heart overflowed with gratitude towards my generous benefactor, and I breathed a silent prayer to heaven, that his felicity in D 2 the married state might be equal to his deserts. A few days after this, Mr. Welldon called. I could not refrain my tears at sight of this worthy man. Past scenes of sorrow rushed upon my mind, which joined to the recollection of my then forlorn, dependant situation almost overcame me. He suffered me to ease my full heart, and then gently enquiring after my health, and how I liked Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my remaining with her, till I had attained a competent knowledge of her business. “I know, my dear Miss Howard,” said he, “that your education and accomplishments fit you to be placed in a more elevated sphere. But my good girl must consider that those accomplishments in her present circumstances will be of no use. Nay, if they are suffered to appear will only excite the envy and ill nature of those with whom she is at present obliged to associate. I would by no means have you neglect those brilliant talents, with which nature has endowed you. It is not to be doubted, but you will find leisure hours when the pen or the pencil will be a happy relief to your mind, and prevent your dwelling too intently on past melancholy events. But let those hours of relaxation be but few, above all things, be careful not to let your companions discover the superiority you certainly possess over them. Educated, as you have been, perhaps you may think, that with great propriety you might undertake the education of children in some family of distinction, or become companion to some lady. I acknowledge, my fair friend, these are the situations for which you seem most adapted, but here an insurmountable obstacle arises you have no female friend who can recommend you; and the recommendation of a man, in these cafes, in general injures the person they mean to serve. You must, therefore, apply yourself attentively to your new profession, and place a firm reliance on Providence to reward your industry with success." I had never attempted to interrupt Mr. Welldon, during this friendly harrangue, but finding he now continued silent, I endeavoured, as well as my tears would permit, to convince him of my gratitude, by promising to do every thing which he had enjoined. Mrs. Lacour was now desired to come in, when all terms having been previously agreed on, he paid my apprentice fee, and it was determined I should remain with her twelve months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had provided me an apartment to myself, and begged my acceptance of the furniture it contained. “This day three weeks, Miss Howard,” said he, “will make me the happiest of men in a union with a young lady of great merit, on whom I have deservedly placed my affections. We shall set off immediately on a visit to the continent to see some relations, who reside constantly in the south of France, so that it may be a long time before I see you again. In this little pocket-book you will find a trifle to answer your immediate expences, and a direction to a gentleman, in the city, where in case of any future exigencies, you may apply, and he will give you both assistance and advice. God bless you, my dear girl; you have my best wishes, and may rest assured of my unalterable friendship.” He then saluted me with the affection of a brother, and took his leave. Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour, by way of diverting my mind from the gloom our parting had cast over it, asked me if I had no curiosity to see the apartment Mr. Welldon had furnished for me. I followed her up two pair of stairs, into a neat back room, where was a tent bed, of striped Manchester, with every necessary apurtenance, a case of drawers, a neat dressing case, and a small trunk, the key of which Mrs. Lacour gave me, and bidding me with a smile examine my treasures, went down stairs. On opening the trunk I found it contained a piece of grey lutestring, two pieces of dark chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten yards of muslin, and a piece of fine linen. Removing these, I discovered at the bottom, a neat edition of the English poets, together with a bible and common prayer book; here also, I found a roll of drawing paper, which led me to imagine I was supplied with other materials for this elegant amusement, and on opening the drawers, I found I had not been deceived in my conjectures; for there I found a box of crayons, pencils and colours, and a leather writing case, in which was a letter of truely brotherly advice. On opening a light closet that adjoined my bed chamber, I discovered another mark of the friendly attention of my benefactor; for there was a small piano forte, with a collection of music by the best masters. My little pocket-book contained a bank note for fifty pounds. Oppressed by a sense of these numerous obligations, my heart almost bursting with grateful emotions, I sunk on my knees by the bed side, and poured forth my thanks to the great Disposer of all things, entreated that the choicest of his blessings might be showered on my benefactor, and prayed his mercy ever to protect and direct me, nor suffer me again, impiously to doubt his power and watchful care. The next morning, I entered on my new employment with alacrity. It is an employment that keeps the mind continually amufed. Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful woman, and some of her young people, sensible, well informed girls. I do not like Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert, illiterate coxcomb. But this does not give me any great uneasiness, as I am not much in his company, except at meal times. When the business of the day is finished, I retire to my own apartment, where writing, reading or music, sweetly relaxes and chears my mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel a charming serenity pervade my heart, and Hope, that bright celestial guest, again has taken up her residence in my bosom. On a Sundy evening, I never fail visiting the dear spot, that contains all that was earthly of my beloved mother. I cannot describe my sensations when I approach the place. They are far from painful Celia, for the remembrance of her piety and virtue is a balm to my heart; and while my eye is fixed on the grave where she lies, my mental faculties behold her blessed spirit beatified, and enjoying the fullness of heavenly bliss in that mansion, where, I trust, I shall one day again embrace her. When I return from these contemplations, my soul is so attuned to harmony, that I sing the hymns or anthems suited to the day, with a pleasure undescribable. I have wrote a few lines, which you will find fully expressive of the frame of my mind. I cannot help regreting, my dearest friend, the happy days I spent with you in the convent, tho' all-chearing Hope bids me look forward; and while I take my present lot with gratitude, humbly aspire to a blessed hereafter. Enclosed are the lines I mention; I sing it to that sweet plaintive air, we were both so fond of. I shall sometimes please myself with the thought, that we may perhaps after you have received this, both sing it at the same moment. God bless you my dear Celia. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HOPE. OH! cease, vain busy fancy cease To dwell on scenes long past, When every hour was wing'd with peace, With joy too great to last. But come, sweet Hope, celestial pow'r, Thy healing comfort bring; Oh sooth my mind, and let me soar Upon thine airy wing. When thro' the vaulted aisle I roam, And breath the sigh sincere, Or o'er my mother's hallowed tomb Drop the sad filial tear: 'Tis thou canst chear the solemn hour, Canst peace and comfort bring, Elate my thoughts, and bid them soar, Upon thine airy wing. Methinks I hear thee whisp'ring say; Mortal, thy tears give o'er, Thy mother, thou in realms of day, Shalt meet to part no more. Sooth'd by thy words, benignant power, My soul exulting springs, And tow'rd the sky, with rapture soars Upon thine airy wings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIX. MERIEL to CELIA. London, January 10th, 1779. There is in this family a Mademoiselle Bagatelle, who is Mrs. Lacour's forewoman; I do not like her, Celia, she dresses in the extremity of the fashion, takes snuff, rouges high, and is high in the good graces of Monsieur Lacour. I can percieve they perfectly understand each other, tho' the prudent wife either does not, or will not, see the intimacy that subsists between them. It has often been a subject of wonder to me, how people, whose tempers and dispositions are the very reverse of each other, could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke together; and yet we daily see instances of sense and folly; virtue and vice; understanding and ignorance; politeness and vulgarity; youth and age; beauty and deformity, Vol. II. E being linked in the same chain: nay, what is more surprising that both parties eagerly put it on. How are we to account for these inconsistencies in human nature, nothing can be more opposite than the dispositions of Monsieur and Mrs. Lacour, and yet I have been told that it was a marriage of inclination and on the lady's side, entirely against the approbation of her friends; hence we must suppose, that either love throws a mist over the discerning optics of its votaries, or that their is a fate in marriage, which it is impossible to counteract. You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear Celia, that among the many long epistles I have lately wrote to you, the name of Rainsforth has never escaped me: indeed, I have had afflictions of so much heavier a nature, than merely the loss of a lover, that some months passed in which I hardly remembered there was such a person in being: however in my present situation, being more easy in my mind, thought has frequently recurred to the period when I expected to have been united to him by indissoluble ties. When I think of him, I am feelingly convinced that my heart is still attached; I almost doubt the intelligence of his infidelity, tho' conveyed to me by the hand of his father: I feel a restless curiosity to be informed of his happiness; I fancy, sometimes that he might have heard reports to my disadvantage; he might have been informed of my unfortunate elopement, of my thoughtless correspondence with Pringle: every circumstance may have been exaggerated; and he may not be so culpable as I at first thought him. These ideas often crowd my imagination. But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues be ever so briliant, he can be nothing to me. I have heard by mere accident that my brother is in a fair way of making his fortune in India; I have wrote to him several times, but recieved no answer; not even a line has arrived from him, since the bill, which I mentioned in a former letter, was paid. Mr. Mossop's family are I find removed into the country, and as to any of those who called themselves my friends in the day of prosperity, if I meet them now they stare me confidently in the face, but do not in the least recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me, that when fortune removes friends to any considerable distance from each other, the party who is the favourite of the fickle goddess almost immediately becomes near-fighted, and is afflicted with a short memory. January 19th. I was yesterday sent to wait on a lady with some caps, &amp;c. in St. James's square. When having waited about half an hour in a cold empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, but could not recollect whose it was. I was striving to call it to my memory in vain, when the door opened, and who should I behold but Miss Pringle, and another young lady. “Come into this room young woman,” said she, “here is a fire, and we will look over your trumpery.” I went in my heart sinking as I moved; for I knew enough of this once affectionate friend to suppose she would not readily acknowledge an acquaintance with a milliner's apprentice. I saw, the moment she cast her eyes on me, she recollected me; but as I did not wish to shew an inclination to renew our acquaintance, I cast down my eyes and remained silent, thinking that if she did not choose to take notice of me, she might settle it within herself that I did not know her. But the lady's curiosity was more predominent than her pride. She looked at me several times and at length cried “if I did not think it almost impossible I should say your name was Howard.” “My name is Howard, ma'am,” said I coldly. “Why, sure as I am alive, it is Meriel Howard.” “The very same, Miss Pringle.” “La! my dear girl, why how came you in this situation, such a fortune as you had left you.” “We are all subject to vicissitudes of fortune,” said I smiling, “but I am extremely happy in my present situation.” “Happy!” said she, lifting up her eyes in surprize. “I am astonished to hear you say so, for my part I should be the most miserable creature on earth, was I reduced to carry a band-box.” “Happiness and misery, Miss,” said I, “are in general the result of our own ideas: if I am content in my humble station, I am in my own mind as happy, nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who riding in a chariot and pair, envies one whose superior fortune can command four or six horses.” She did not seem to comprehend me, but turning to the other lady, said, “well I vow sister it is very astonishing; but this young woman, only four years ago, had a fortune of four thousand pounds, her father lived in the neighbourhood of our country-hou?e. My brother was very fond of her once, and I believe she did not altogether dislike him, did you Meriel? I fancy your little heart never regained its liberty.” E 2 “I rather suppose, Miss Pringle, that it never was a captive. If at one time I was foolish enough to fancy myself in love with your brother, it was before I had the power of distinguishing a real from an ideal passion, or before I was a competent judge of what would be most conducive to my own happiness.” “Aye,” said she, “you can talk of it with a great deal of composure now, but you certainly was very fond of him once or you would not have resolved to run away with him; nay, can you deny that you were out of your senses about him, when you heard he was married.” This cruel reflection on my unfortunate malady, which was occasioned by the severest affliction that ever child indured, was more than my spirits could support, I turned my face from her to to hide the tears that trickled fast from my eyes; but could not command my voice to give her an answer, when she continued: “Well, but where are Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and master Richard?” “My brother is in India—I have no parents.” “Poor, dear girl,” said the other young lady, now speaking for the first time, “that is a dreadful thing. I know what it is to have no parents.” She took my hand, and I saw her mild eyes glisten with compassion. I wished to put an end to this painful conversation, and therefore desired to know if they would keep any of the caps. “Oh, yes, I shall have several, but stop Meriel, I must let my mother know you are here. Dear, how she will be surprized; and you shall go down to Baker, she will pay you, and do have a glass of wine before you go, and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I am married.” “I wish you much happiness madam,” said I, coldly; “but I cannot stay to take any refreshment: I have been here much longer than I ought to have staid.” You must know, my dear Celia, that my pride was hurt at the idea of standing first to be catechised by the mother, and then be dismissed to the house-keeper for wine and cake; and this treatment from a girl, who once called herself my friend, and thought herself honoured by the title. However, I could not escape; the mother was called, and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I answered Mrs. Pringle's questions in as short a manner as possible; but obstinately refused going down with the house-keeper. “Ah! poor girl,” said Mrs. Pringle, in an affected whisper to her daughter; “let the wine be brought up, my dear; you see she cannot as yet submit to the alteration in her situation.” “You are mistaken madam,” said I, “I do not feel the least embarassment from the reflection that I owe my support to industry: it is what many, more worthy than myself are obliged to do, it is by no means humiliating. True dignity is seated in the soul, nor can any situation make me forget the respect ever due to myself. I cannot but reflect ladies, that I am the same Miss Howard, whom some few years ago, you were so extremely fond of, and eagerly striving which could shew her the most respect. Tho' I am now bereaved of that fortune, which I percieve was the magnet which attracted your attentions. I can make proper distinctions; as a trades person, I can easily submit to be turned over to your house-keeper for payment; but remembering I have once been your companion, am still your equal, I cannot submit to be placed on a level with your servants.” They could not answer. Shame and astonishment tied their tongues. I curtsied slightly and followed Mrs. Baker out of the room. While she was paying me, the loquacious house-keeper informed me that her master had been married about three weeks; that he never saw Miss Pringle till within a month of their union; that he danced with her at a ball, and was struck with her pleasing person, and insinuating manner; “but I can see,” continued she, “it will not be a very happy union; and Miss Sally, poor girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It was a sad thing, sir John left her dependant on her brother.” “What then,” said I, “your master is a baronet?” “No,” said she, “his father was a knight, but the title died with him. He was a wealthy citizen, and was knignted for carrying an address to the king on some particular occasion.” I had now recieved my money, and not wishing to pry into the secrets of a family, with whom I desired not to form any connection, I wished Mrs. Baker a good morning, and left the house. In the hall I met Miss Sally. “You will have a long walk Miss Howard,” said she; “had I any command here, you should not carry that heavy box.” “It is not heavy, Miss,” said I. “But it is cumbersome,” she replied, “and you are not accustomed to such employment.” She then opened the door herself, and smiling, with a sweet look of benevolence, wished me a good morning. I pitied the dear girl, for sure I am, if she is dependant on her brother, her new sister will not contribute to make her life very comfortable. As I walked home, I could not avoid reflecting on this rencounter with Miss Pringle; nor did my heart entirely approve my own conduct: there was too much pride in the manner in which I spoke to her: indeed, since I have been poor, Celia, I have discovered that I am very proud, much more so than is becoming; I will endeavour to correct this error, and in future adapt my sentiments to the station in which it has pleased Providence to place me. I have met with many civilities from some of Mrs. Lacour's customers; especially a Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very genteel fortune, at least, if I am to conjecture from the manner in which she lives: she is very fond of poetry, and has advised me to endeavour to raise a subscription for the publication of those poems I formerly mentioned to you. Mrs. Lacour does not disapprove the plan, and I am by this indulging woman, allowed more time to pursue my favourite study, than I should have met with in any other place. I have obtained several very respectable names to my subscription; and have some cards of proposals printed which I keep in the shop to present to the ladies who constantly frequent it. I cannot say, Celia, but it would be much more pleasing to me, could I obtain a living by the exertion of any of my natural talents, than by following the straight forward path of the plodding woman of business; besides I was never designed for a milliner, I cannot flatter, I cannot tell a woman whom age, and other natural defects, have rendered extremely plain, that a full dress cap with artificial flowers small handkerchief, and all the gay trappings that belong to the smiling season of eighteen, will become her face and figure: and yet this is a very necessary ingredient in the composition of a milliner. I wish to my heart some other plan could be struck out, where I should not be obliged to say and attest things so directly contrary to my own opinion. I am not so happy in this family as I at first thought I should be, Mr. Lacour pays me too much attention lately; I hate the forward concieted fellow, tho' were it only to mortify Mademoiselle I could take a pleasure in listening to his nonsense; but when I reflect that by so doing I may wound the peace of a deserving woman, who treats me with tenderness, and favours me with her esteem, I feel such a mixture of horror end detestation rise in my heart, that I frequently answer his passionate sallies with an acrimony, that makes him bite his lips with vexation. I shall be glad when my time is expired, tho' I have as yet thought of no elligible plan to pursue in future. Adieu, my friend, believe in every change of fortune I am your's affectionately. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXX. MERIAL to CELIA, London, July 15th, 1780. Again, my beloved Celia, am I cast upon the world without a friend to guide me; scarcely yet have I seen twenty years, and what vicissitudes of fortune have I experienced. In my last I mentioned my design of publishing some poems by subscription; but in that design I am disappointed, as well as in every other from which I have ever hoped to extract either pleasure or comfort. About a month since I recieved the following letter, from the gentleman to whom Mr. Welldon gave me a direction; I transcribe it for your perusal, that you may see how unfortunate I am in having the most innocent actions of my life wrested in such a manner as to be made to appear to my disadvantage. Vol. II. F TO MISS HOWARD. Friday-street, May 3d. MISS HOWARD, WHEN your friend, Mr. Welldon, left England he did not propose staying above six weeks or two months at most; but unfortunately for him he has been detained on the continent by a continued series of ill health, and he is now at Aix-la-Chappelle in a very dangerous state. When last I saw him he gave me a very particular account of your first acquaintance with him, an account which I must confess raised you both in my opinion, as it proved the goodness of your hearts: he also informed me in what manner he had placed you with Mrs. Lacour, and desired I would frequently call and enquire how you went on, and whether you were satisfied with the treatment you received. Family uneasiness, and various vexations have prevented my fulfilling my promise, till last Thursday, when I called at Mrs. Lacour's, and the result of that visit leads me to trouble you with this letter; for as I must naturally feel interested in the welfare of every one dear to Mr. Welldon, I think it my duty to give you a little advice, and to let you know in what light you are considered by the major part of the family where you reside. At the time I made my visit you were out, waiting on some ladies: Mrs. Lacour spoke of you in the tenderest manner, but said you were by no means calculated for the business Mr. Welldon had placed you in; her sensibility is very great sir, said she, and her notions so very refined and delicate, she is totally unable to bear the rude and often insulting manners of many of our customers: besides, sir, she loves study too well ever to make any great proficient at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being called away, a pert, forward French woman undertook to finish your character: she threw out the most malignant aspersions on your conduct in general, said you had made yourself the laughing stock of the whole family, that many of the ladies who frequented the shop, distinguished you by the appellation of little scribbler: that you were thoughtless, extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and that you had by your artful conduct alienated the affection of monsieur Lacour from his wife, and in all these assertions she wss joined by her companions, who seemed to consider you only as a fit object of ridicule. Tho' I could not avoid seeing the motive that instigated these women was envy, yet the reviewers call it sad trash, and my lady I must think you have not conducted yourself altogether in the prudent manner I should have expected from the character Mr. Welldon gave of you. Consider Miss Howard, industry is the only hope you can have of future support: let me conjure you therefore, as a friend, to throw aside the pen, and apply to your needle, and let your inventive fancy be exerted to decorate the persons of your fair country women. Believe me, the hill of Parnassus is too high for you to climb, unless you had the hand of independance to help you up; the finest turned poem will be entirely overlooked by the world when ushered into it by an obscure author; while a raphsody of nonsense will be universally read and applauded when the author is publicly known to be favoured with the smiles of fortune. We will suppose, my dear, that you had finished a pleasing elegant poem, essay, novel, or what not; and that some bookseller should for a trifling consideration engage to introduce it to public notice; a new publication no sooner makes it appearance than the people of fashion enquire, who the author is. “Have you read the new poem my lady?” says sir Timothy Trifle. “No not I, is it good for any thing?” “'Pon honour I don't know, Pedegree told me it was wrote by a little milliner, who lived at Lacour's,” “Prithee, dear sir Timothy, no more, I am quite sick already; what can a milliner's girl know of litirature?” Thus my dear, you will find people of fashion will not give your book a perusal: and tho' there are some few who may read it with pleasure, and give it the encomiums its merit deserves, they will be ashamed to avow an opinion contrary to that of their superiors; while the generality of the world satisfied with the sentence already passed, will not be at the trouble of reading and judging for themselves: the consequence will be you will not sell enough to pay the expence of printing and paper, and you will have the mortification to see your poems used as waste paper, to wrap up parcels, &amp;c. I flatter myself, your natural good sense will lead you to consider this letter in the friendly light it was intended, that you will do your utmost to cradicate from the minds of your companions every idea they may have formed to your disadvantage, that you will drop all thought of shining in the literary world, and apply yourself chearfully to that employment by which you may hope to pass through life with comfort and respectability. I am, your sincere wellwisher, H. FRIENDLY. F 2 The reception of this letter made me very uneasy, especially the part which mentioned the illness of my kind hearted benefactor: I was grieved also to find what a bubble I had been to Mademoiselle and all the apprentices, as they had all pretended to be greatly pleased with my writings, and had often said it was a thousand pities, so bright a genius shonld be buried in oblivion: however it opened my eyes to their deceit and flattery; and I determined to be more upon my guard in future. I felt extremely grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he had taken in writing to me, answered his letter immediately, promised to profit by his advice, and reqnested to be again favoured with a few lines whenever he should hear from Mr. Welldon. From this time I applied myself with great assiduity to my employment; tho' I could not help noticing a visible alteration in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour: she became cold and distant, frequently spoke to me in a tone of displeasure, and seemed carefully to avoid my conversation, except what was absolutely necessary in the business. The apprentices treated me with disrespect, and Mademoiselle aimed at me the most pointed sarcasms. Things were in this situation, when one day as I was sitting pensive in a little back parlour, where we usually breakfasted, I was surprised by the sudden entrance of Monsieur Lacour, who began in the usual strain to profess his admiration, and audaciously solicited return of his illicit passion. “Your insolence sir,” said I, “is insufferable, I can no longer submit to it, and if ever again you shock my ears with such infamous solicitations I will inform your much injured wife of your intimacy with Mademoiselle.” I then would have left the room but he threw himself between me and the door, and seizing my hand, impudently swore, my threat proceeded only from jealousy. “But come my sweet creature,” said he “do not let that make you uneasy, I will promise never to speak to Bagatelle again.” He then fell on his knees with a look of ludicrous grimace, which at another time would only have made me laugh: but at that time I felt far different sensations. Unable to free myself from his grasp, and hurt at the mean opinion he entertained of me, all my fortitude forsook me, and I burst into tears. At that moment the door opened, and in rushed Mrs. Lacour, Mademoiselle and Mr. Friendly. “Oh Meriel!” cried Mrs. Lacour; “I could not have believed”—She would have fallen to the ground, had I not sprang forward to catch her as she fainted. “You see sir,” said Mademoiselle to Mr. Friendly, as we were supporting Mrs. Lacour to a chair. “You see sir, I told you only the truth.” Monsieur, in the general confusion walked unobserved away. My distress was very great to see Mrs. Lacour in this situation. I feared it might be of dangerous consequence, as she was far advanced in her pregnancy. I supported her in my arms, chafed her temples with Hungary water, and on the first return of life, begged her not to think me so guilty as I appeared. She shook her head, pushed me from her, and leaning on Mademoiselle's arm, went out of the room. I then addressed Mr. Friendly as a stranger; for I did not at that time personally know him; and entreated he would endeavour to heal this breach between Mrs. Lacour and myself: “indeed sir,” said I, “she is the only friend I have; I would sooner die than injure her.” I then related briefly every thing that had past, and fully explained the cause of the tears he saw me shed. “Appearances are undoubtedly against you Miss Howard,” said he, “but I am willing to believe you innocent. I am extremely sorry there is any dissention between you and Mrs. Lacour, she being as you have just remarked, your only friend. I yesterday received a letter from Mrs. Welldon, informing me that her husband died about a fortnight since. She mentions you as a person of whom Mr. Welldon spoke in his last moments, and desires me to give you fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the same time she bids me inform you it is the last you will receive from her.” I was so overcome, indeed I may say stupified with grief, I was totally unable to answer. He saw and I believe pitied my distress and thus continued. “I have added to this little present fifty pounds more; and would advise you to leave this family immediately, and in some genteel neighbourhood open a little shop, endeavour to gain employment; be prudent and industrious, and I have no doubt of your success; but prithee, good my girl, burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in literary pursuits, as a counsellor would do seated at a tambour frame or busied in assorting colours for embroidery.” I promised to remember his friendly advice, he paid me the money and took his leave. I was now anxious to see Mrs. Lacour but all attempts to that purpose were fruitless. I wrote a letter protesting my innocence and received a verbal answer by one of the aprentices that the thing was too plain to admit of any doubt, that she wished me well but had no desire ever to see me again. I retired to my apartment with a heart overcharged with sorrow. At any other time, the death of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would have been in itself a sufficient affliction: but now I had the additional one of knowing I had tho, unintionally, injured the health of a woman, I sincerely esteemed, incurred the censures of the world, and cast an indeliable blemish on my reputation, which it had ever been my study to preserve unsullied. In these melancholy reflections I past the day; in the evening the servant brought me up a candle and some supper: but I was too much agitated to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I was fully convinced that to sleep would be impossible. About twelve o'clock I heard a great bustle below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I jumped out of bed and opening my chamber door to listen, plainly heard one of the young women say, “she cannot live, the doctor says it is impossible.” Terrified beyond measure I put on a few cloaths and ran hastily down stairs, determined at all events to see this dear sufferer, and by convincing her of my innocence restore her mind to peace. The danger she was in had thrown the family into such confusion, that I found no opposition made to my entering the appartment. The curtains were close drawn round the bed, and there was little light in the room, so that she did not perceive me when I entered, I found the agitation of her mind had thrown her into a premature labour, and that the surgeon imagined her life to be in iminent danger. Every other thought was now absorbed in my anxiety for her. I beckoned her sister who was setting by the bedside. She came to me, I told her the distress of my mind and begged her to believe me not guilty. “Dear Meriel,” said she, “I never thought you so, nor would my poor sister have ever entertained an idea to your prejudice, had it not been for the insinuations of Bagatelle, who has now plainly discovered the motive which led her so maliciously to asperse your character: however no one can now have a doubt of your innocence. Mademoiselle went out about eight this evening, which greatly surprised us, as my sister was so ill. As the evening advanced, her abscence became more astonishing, and about an hour since a person called who had seen Bagatelle and the ungrateful Lacour get into a chaise at an inn door and drive off for Dover.” Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I could not but rejoice that this proceeding of theirs was a convicing proof of my innocence. I inquired, if this unfortunate woman had been informed of their persidy, and being answered in the affirmative, and told that the intelligence had precipitated her illness, I asked, if I might be permited to speak to her. When she was informed that I was in the room, she called me to her with a faint voice, and taking hold of my hand, said, “Meriel, forgive me, I have injured you; but I was myself decieved.” She could not say more, her pains became excruciating, and after continuing many hours in a state of exquisite torture, she resigned her breath, having given birth to a female infant who survived her mother but a few moments. Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was soon spread abroad; and it was discovered that he had not only collected all the debts, previous to his departure, but had also stripped the house of every thing valuable, so that when the creditors brought in their accounts, there was not sufficient property to pay five shillings in the pound. Every thing was immediately seized, and the hapless Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged to the parish for a decent funeral, had not her sister, tho' but in indifferent circumstances and myself borne the expence between us. When I had paid every necessary respect to the memory of this unfortunate woman, I began to think of my own affairs. You may remember my mentioning a Mrs. Moreton, from whom I had recieved many civilities. She lived at a small village a few miles out of town. To her I applied for advice, in my present embarrassing situation. She received me with politeness, told me she would exert herself to the utmost to serve me and said she thought I might make my business answer very well in Kensington, where she had many friends to whom she could recommend me. To a heart formed for all the endearing and social ties of life, how every little kindness is received with gratitude, and how does it feel the attentions even of common civility. I feel myself growing attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her manner is the most preposessing, her form ellegant and and she posesses the polite accomplishments in an imminent degree. She is the wife of an officer now in India, by whom Vol. II. G she has two lovely children, her mansion is a little terrestial paradise. Every thing about it is neat, compact, and charming. I have not as yet met with an apartment to suit me, tho' I have seen several, however it is determined I shall not have a shop but carry on my business as a chamber milliner. My heart almost sinks at the idea of a young, unprotected creature like myself, venturing upon such a plan, but what can I do, convinced as I am of the impossibility of ever doing any thing in the literary way, I shall never more renew my attempts. I must remember the last words of my dear mother, “be humble, patient and industrious, and rely on heaven for support.” Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia. But I need not ask them, I am sure my sweet benevolent friend looks round the whole universe with an eye of heavenly complacency, and wishes every bosom as tranquil as her own; and that your happiness may never be diminished, is the fervant prayer of MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXI. MERIEL to CELIA. Kensington, August 23d, 1780. I am now settled in a very neat apartment, within about a half a mile of Mrs. Moreton's house; the people with whom I lodge appear obliging and friendly, and from the specimen I have already had, I think I shall obtain a very genteel living, as I have much more work than I can perform myself, and am obliged to employ several young women. My Sundays I always spend with Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church in the morning, she dines so late, it is impossible to go in the afternoon. She has introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger, a man of great genius, and independent fortune: Mrs. Belger is the most exquisitely beautiful woman I ever beheld; but she has no accomplishments, nor can I think she has been even decently educated; indeed, I have heard it whispered that she is not his wife; however, she goes by his name, does the honours of his table, and has by him a sweet little girl, the very image of her beautiful mother: this child has more firmly knit the bonds that holds her faithful to its father; but tho' every look, word and action, speaks the ardency and purity of her attachment: he treats her with a cold respect, which I am sure must cut her to the soul: he is civil, polite, but distant. In this family I spend many agreeable hours; I think Mr. Belger the most sensible man I ever conversed with, indeed, the more I converse with him the more I am convinced of my own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to instruct me, directs my taste in the choice of authors, corrects my judgment, and takes great pleasure in improving me in both music and drawing. To confess the truth, I have but little time to spare for these persuits; but I sometimes steal a few hours from rest to perform my necessary employments, that I may the next day have a little time to attend to Mr. Belger's instructions. We cannot quite agree about religious matters, but I dispute with him, nor have I any doubt of making a convert of him; for at present, my dear Celia, this agreeable man either is or pretends to be an infidel; I rather think it is the latter, for he said the other evening he loved to hear my sentiments delivered with such charming enthusiasm, tho' they were in direct opposition to his own. I have had some doubt about the propriety of continuing my intimacy in this family, as Mrs. Belger is supposed to be only his mistress; but her whole conduct is such as may call a blush upon the cheek of many an insolent woman, who looking with merciless disdain on her poor fallen sisters, smiles contemptously and thanks heaven she is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a tender, exemplary mother, a kind mistress to her servants, a good christian, and a meek, obedient, faithful, I had almost said wife; but the mystic words have not passed that can render her character respectable in every eye: you will therefore say, my dear Celia, she is an improper companion for a girl whose reputation has once been doubted, and cannot be regained by associating with a woman, whose character is suspicious: True, my dear girl, but I feel myself so attached to the family so grateful for the attentions shewn me, and am so conscious of my own solitary friendless situation, that my heart deprived of every affection, every fond hope on which it once rested, naturally clings to those whose kindness sooths its anxieties to rest. G 2 September 16th. I have been so frightened, my dear Celia, that I believe it will be sometime before I recover myself; and I cannot but consider it a great mercy that I am alive and able to relate the cause of my terror. In the apartment adjoining the room where I sleep, the maid of the house sleeps with two of the younger children, for they have a large family. About four o'clock this morning, I was awoke by a sense of suffocation, and starting up, perceived my chamber to be full of smoak, I jumped out of bed and looking round to fee that there was no appearance of fire in the room, ventured to open one of the windows a little way to disperse it. I then opened the door, which led to the childrens room, here the smoak was more thick, and I found the smell of fire grow stronger; but what were my sensations, on going into their apartment to see a basket of cloaths which stood on a chair by the bedside all on fire, and the curtains of the bed which were fortunately of woolen just beginning to burn. I had not an instant for consideration, Providence directed me; for I am conscious that reason was for a few moments intirely suspended, I ran back to my own bed; dragged of a blanket and immediately threw it over the burning basket, at the same time pouring on it a large pan of water, which stood in the room, and had been placed there for the purpose of washing the children. I then awoke the servant, and took the dear little innocents out of the bed; they had been so nearly suffocated it was with difficulty I awoke them, and when brought into the air blood gushed from their noses: when I had a little recovered them and laid them in my bed, I returned to the other chamber, sent the maid down for more water, and having entirely extinguished every appearance of fire, began to have the use of reflection: my own almost miraculous escape from so horrible a death, the safety of the children, nay, the preservation of the lives and property of the whole family, impressed my mind with such awful gratitude towards the Power, who had in such unexpected danger inspired and directed me, that I threw myself on my knees and burst into tears of unfeigned thankfulness. Had I not discovered it at the time I did, we must all have inevitably perished; for the rest of the family lay in apartments built distinctly from this part of the house: the apartments I occupied were over the shop, and this room really belonged to me, but as I had no use for it I gave it up to the servant and children. The master, mistress, three more children and two apprentices, slept on the ground floor behind the shop, so that the whole front of the house might have been in flames, before they would have discovered it. I asked the girl how she imagined the accident had happened; she said she often was obliged to sit up very late for her master, that she had been up that night, till near two o'clock, and being obliged to work very hard in the day time, she was very sleepy and weary; that she imagines she must have left the candle burning on the floor, and that it had caught some of the linen that hung from the basket. You may easily suppose I was not inclined to go to bed again, I therefore dressed myself, and waited the rising of the family. When I heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two young children in my hand and went down. “You are up early, Miss Howard,” said she, “I hope the children have not been making a noise to disturb you.” “I was up much earlier than you can imagine,” I replied, “but believe me these little dears have been very quiet and good, but I was sadly alarmed this morning at four o'clock.” “Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what?” “At an accident which had like to prove fatal to us all.” “Good God!” said she, “what can have been the matter?” “Come, come, my good Mrs. Newtram,” said I, seeing her turn pale, “there is no occasion for terror now, the danger is past, you see your children are safe, but we have been all on fire up stairs to night.” “Merciful heaven!” said she, “that careless Betty.” “Do not blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as she is in the day time, she cannot be supposed capable of sitting up till two or three o'clock in the morning, especially when we recollect she in general rises at six, to perform her daily avocations; and I will just beg leave to mention that it is my earnest wish she may be forgiven: she has suffered enough already from her fright, do not, therefore, reproach her, and I will be answerable such an accident never happens again in any place where she is.” I then took Mrs. Newtram up stairs, and shewed her the things that had been on fire. When she saw the imminent danger to which her children had been exposed, she caught them in her arms and with all the enthusiasm of maternal affection, blest heaven for their preservation. “Oh! Miss Howard,” said she, “how can we ever be grateful enough for your quick recollection in such an alarming situation; we are bound to consider you as our guardian angel.” I stopped the good woman in the midst of her acknowledgments, to renew my entreties for Betty's pardon, and that she might be continued in her place. “I can deny you nothing,” said she; “but I am afraid Mr. Newtram will be inveterate against her.” “That will be cruel indeed,” said I, “for he was himself undoubtedly the prior cause of the accident, by keeping such very late hours.” She then went down stairs, and I went to breakfast; which before I had half finished was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Newtram. He repeated every acknowledgment before made by his wife, sealed Betty's pardon, and declared he wished for nothing more, than for some opportunity to convince me of his gratitude, and that he would almost lay down his life to serve me. Thus you see, my dear Celia, this accident will in the end terminate for my good, as it seems to have secured the affection and friendship of those, in whose house I reside; and in case of future trouble I make no doubt, but I shall find in these worthy people, a kindness nearly maternal. Farewell my friend; your's ever. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXII. MERIEL to CELIA. Kensington, December 5th, 1780. MR. BELGER has frequently private concerts at his house. I always am one of the party. Sometimes I perform on the piano forte; sometimes sing, and always meet with such applause, as almost makes me vain; indeed the praises of Mr. Belger only, are sufficient for that purpose. He is the only man I could ever think perfectly agreeable, since the conduct of Rainsforth gave me so very despicable an opinion of the whole sex. But of one thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to enter into arguments with persons who have an improper opinion of religious matters. I have had frequent conversations with Mr. Belger on this topic, and instead of being able to convince him of his errors. (You will tremble whem I tell you) I have only imbibed his principles, and find doubt arising in my mind concerning the most sacred parts of the holy writings. Oh! my dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that she may not be lost by listening to this insinuating man. I have indeed made frequent resolutions to avoid his company, and as frequently broke them. I take my heart severely to task. Surely Celia, after it has suffered so much from the perfidy of the sex, it cannot be so weak, nay so wicked, as to feel an attachment for a man who is another's right. Do not fear for me, my beloved friend; if I cannot command my feelings, I can my actions. Should I at some future period discover that Rainsforth is not the capricious character, he at present appears, I will never have the mortification to reflect, I have rendered myself unworthy of his esteem: if otherwise, it shall never be in the power of any man to boast, that he has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate, but I never will be guilty. Business does not answer so well as I expected. Many, I believe, employed me at first from motives of curiosity, and that being gratified, they return to those they formerly dealt with; and I have now scarcely enough to employ myself, and one young woman, whom Mrs. Moreton has recommended to me. However, I keep up my spirits as well as I can, and hope for better times. My letters are few, you say lately. Indeed I have nothing either new or interesting to write about. When I have, you shall hear from your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXIII. MERIEL to CELIA. London, February 9th, 1781. What a world this is, my friend, and of what a medly of strange inconsistent characters is it composed. Were it not impious, I could wish I had never entered it. Some few years since, I believed every heart glowed with humanity, friendship and sincerity toward each other. Yes, Celia, at the time I left the convent these were Vol. II. H my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very lately I began to perceive how erroneous my opinion was; but believe me, the more we know of mankind the less we find to admire or esteem. The heart grows hardened by repeated disappointments, and from having an unbounded confidence in our fellow-creatures, we begin to suspect every one of hypocrisy. My dear friend, I am still the sport of capricious fortune. Deceived, betrayed by those I most loved and trusted, I have no comfort left but my dependance on heaven, (which thank God, I have regained) and the conscious integrity of my own heart. Some little time after my last letter, Mrs. Moreton called on me one morning, in her way to town, and asked if I would take a ride with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage. I had nothing to prevent me and immediately complied. We proceeded to town, and stopped at a silk mercer's. Mrs. Moreton ordered some silks to be put up, but when she came to pay for them, discovered she had left her purse behind her. I had money sufficient about me, and therefore offered to pay the amount of the bill. “Do so, my dear,” said she, “it will be all the same. I can pay you again when we get home.” It came to upwards of ten pounds, as she purchased a piece of silk for a lady whom she expected out of the country. When we returned the expected lady was arrived. She approved the silk, and after dinner took a walk to my apartments, where she ordered some very elegant linen to be made: the lace she chose it to be trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You can get this done by Saturday afternoon, said Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay a visit to very particular people, and this lady would wish to have it to wear. As soon as they were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to send me more of the lace; for the handkerchief, apron, and ruffles were all to be full trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he did not hesitate. The muslin I had by me; and on Saturday afternoon, according to their desire, I took the whole suit home, which, when finished, came to near fifty pounds. They were much pleased with it, and desired I would bring my bill on Monday morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a small gold watch by my side, which was given me by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value, but for the sake of the doner, it was highly prized by me. “Meriel, my love,” said Mrs. Moreton, “I have sent my watch to be cleaned; I shall be at a loss to know how time goes: do lend me your's for this evening.” “I set great store by it, madam,” said I, “it was the gift of a deceased friend; but I think you will be careful of it.” “As I would of my own,” she replied, as she took it. “Stay, madam,” said I, “there is a little trinket to it which I have vowed never to part with.” (It was a small locket which contained a lock of my dear mother's hair). She suffered me to take it off, and Mr. Belger's coach coming to the door to attend the ladies, they set me down at my own lodging, and proceeded to town. The next day, being Sunday, I dined at Mr. Belger's, where I was surprised to hear that the ladies had sent home the carriage, without returning themselves, and that Mrs. Moreton's children were in town with her. However I felt no uneasiness or suspicion, and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs. Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter astonishment found the house entirely shut up, and was informed by a neighbour, that it was a ready furnished house, which she had occupied near a twelve-month, and that she had discharged her servant on Saturday morning; that they had every reason to suppose she did not intend to come back again, for she had not paid the house rent, and was besides in debt to every body in the neighbourhood, who would trust her; and that on going into the house, which the landlord had done early this morning, they found nothing in it that had ever belonged to her; but missed a considerable quantity of linen, which had been lent her when she took the house. I was now fatally convinced that my confidence in Mrs. Moreton had been ill placed; the linen I had made, the money I had lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to reduce my finances, and I began to see the difficulties, in which this ungenerous conduct would involve me. At first, it struck me, that Mr. Belger had been accessary to her departure; but in this I was deceived, for on calling there, I found they were as greatly surprized as I had been, and that her specious appearance had so far imposed on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with this new affliction, I returned to my lodging; but judge if you possibly can, of my increased anguish, when, on entering my bed-chamber, I saw my bureau had been forced open, all my cash gone, and with it a quantity of edging to a large amount. Almost ready to sink with the terror that seized my mind, I rang the bell violently, and nobody immediately answering, I ran down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and H 2 enquired after Kitty. “Bless me, Miss Howard,” said Mrs. Newtram, “did you not discharge her before you went out this morning.” “No, indeed I had not the most distant thought of such a thing.” “Well, that's strange now; for you had not been out above five minutes, before she came down crying, and begged one of the apprentices to go for a coach, said you had discharged her at a moment's warning, but she would go directly home to her mother. When the coach came, we helped her in with her boxes, and she drove away, ordering the man to stop at the White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly.” “I'm undone,” said I, “what will become of me;” and sunk almost fainting, into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me some hartshorn and water, after which I began to shed tears, which in some measure relieved me. “Dear Miss,” cried Mrs. Newtram, “what can have happened: have you lost any of your friends?” “Oh!” said I, “I have no friends; I am the most unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I know how to extricate myself from the difficulties that surround me.” I then gave her an account of Mrs. Moreton's departure, of the money, &amp;c. I had trusted her with, and concluded with the discovery I had just made of Kitty's dishonesty. “Why to be sure Miss Howard,” said she, “it is a sad loss; but you should have been upon your guard against Mrs. Moreton; you certainly knew she was a woman of dubious character; and to tell you the truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often said it was a great pity, so sweet a young lady should be so intimate, with a woman of that kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all the world knows she is no better than she should be; and you can't think what ill natured things have been said in the neighbourhood, about your being so much with them.” “As to Mrs. Moreton,” said I, “believe me, I had not the least idea, but that she was a woman of respectable character; and tho' I have heard some things, not quite so much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never saw a woman in my life whose whole conduct demanded more respect and esteem.” “Upon my word Miss,” said she, “I am surprized to hear you talk so, when you know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger is not her husband; but that I have a very good opinion of you, I should think you was as bad as she.” “I think, Mrs. Newtram,” said I, “as you seem to know Mrs. Moreton's character so well it would have been but friendly to have given me a little warning.” “Why, la! Miss, you know it was no business of mine, and you told me yourself you knew her before you came to settle here: but, how do you mean to do? I suppose you have some friends to whom you can apply; if you have any letter, or any thing to send to town one of our young men shall take it.” “I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have not a friend in the world; I am a poor solitary being, unconnected with the world, or any one in it; and were I this moment to leave it, not one tear of affection or regret would be shed upon my grave.” “Dear, now that's very odd, most people have some friend or other, but I suppose you have offended all your's.” “They are dead,” said I, “and unless you favour me with your advice and assistance, I know not to whom else to apply.” “To be soure, I'll give you the best advice in my power, but had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?” “Oh no, I would wish to hide my distress from him in particular.” “You are in debt? I suppose,” asked Mrs. Newtram, in a quick accent. “Yes, I owe above forty guineas.” “Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the lodging due, that's eight more, then there's the laundress and the baker.” “True,” said I, in an humble tone, “but I suppose my furniture will sell for as much as will pay them.” “And is that all your dependance? then I shall take care that we loose nothing: here, Newtram,” continued she, opening a door that looked into the shop, “here, step here:” when he came in, she told him my situation and concluded, “then you know, as that is the case, we had better take care of ourselves, and be the first to take the furniture.” “That's true dame,” said he, “so d'ye see, Miss, we'll send for a man to 'praise the goods to-morrow.” Astonishment almost suspended my faculties: “just heaven!” said I, “is this friendship?” “Friendship,” said she, tartly, “I have a large family Miss, and all my friendship must be exerted for my children: if I was inclined to give you the eight guineas you owe me I cannot do it in justice to these little innocents.” Celia, she pointed to the two children I had saved from the fire: I fixed my eyes on the unoffending infants, a fresh flood of tears burst from them, I folded my hands upon my bosom and remained silent. It was now one o'clock and the servant brought in their dinner; they sat down to table, but did not ask me to partake, I should not have noticed the impropriety of my remaining in their apartment, had I not been roused from my stupefaction by the youngest girl, who getting from her seat brought her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap, and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth crying, “there Missy eat some dinnee.” I kissed the dear child, and apologizing for my intrusion went up to my apartment; where I vented my full heart, in an unrestrained slood of tears. Toward evening Betty came into my room; she said her mistress was gone out, and she had stolen up unknown to her master to see if she could do any thing for me. “You have had no dinner,” said the kind girl, “pray let me get you some tea.” She then made up the fire, and presently provided this repast, which however disinclined, I forced myself to take, to ease poor Betty's anxiety. When she had removed the tea things and lighted a candle, she went down stairs again, and I sat pensive and solitary, retracing the past events of my life. Alas! said I, how very hard is my fate. Possessed as I am of a heart moulded to compassion, glowing with universal affection towards my fellow creatures, I am constantly thrown among people, whose every feeling is absorbed in self. Yet sure humanity is the child of nature; it is a heavenly spark of intellectual fire, implanted in our souls by the hand divine. Every heart is endowed with it more or less; but an intercourse with the world contributes to blunt those keen sensations, till by degrees they are entirely deadened, and we can look on a scene of misery without the least emotion, if it interferes not with our own interest or happiness. Yet I cannot think that I shall ever arrive at that happy state of torpidity, for sure, while I can feel my own sorrows, I shall never be insensible to the woes of others; for never yet did I see a person in affliction, but I made their case my own, and my heart would instantly overflow with pity. But alas! no heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs. Newtram seems to have forgot that she has daughters, or she would surely compassionate my sufferings, by reflecting that those darlings of her heart may perhaps one day be in the same situation. I was still pursuing this melancholy train of thought, when I was startled by a gentle tap at the door. I arose and opened it, but was surprised to see Mr. Belger enter the room. “Dear Miss Howard,” said he, “forgive this liberty. I have been informed of your distress by your officious landlady, whom I have left chattering to to Mrs. Belger, while I slipped away to offer any assistance in my power to my charming little friend.” I bowed my head, but could not answer. I motioned towards a chair. He seated himself and continued: “My dear Meriel, I have long feared what is now realized; I knew from the first moment I saw you, that you were never designed for the station, in which you have lately moved. The elegance of your manner, the delicacy of your sentiments convince me you are far superior to those women with whom it has been your misfortune to be obliged to associate.” “Indeed, Mr. Belger,” said I, “I am conscious of that superioty in nothing but misery. I look round me with a desponding eye, and think the world does not contain so friendless, so wretched a creature as myself.” “From my soul do I pity you,” said he, taking my hand, “and wish it was in my power effectually to serve you without offering any thing that might alarm your sensibility; but that is impossible. I know of but one method, by which you can be extricated from your present difficulties.” “Alas, sir,” I replied, “I have not the least hope of being extreated. All my furniture will be seized to-morrow, and I shall turned from this habitation without knowing how to provide another.” “Not so, beloved girl,” said he. “You cannot think I will suffer it. Long have I adored your merits. You must have seen my ardent affection, which has so often burst thro' the thin veil, prudence obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity has not misled me, I flatter myself I am not altogether indifferent to you; if so, my dear creature, what remains, but that we this night bid adieu to all these vexations? Let us defy the malignant censures of the world, and happy in each other's affections, rise superior to the narrow bounds imposed by priest-craft and superstition; dare to think and act for ourselves, and seek that Vol. II. I felicity on the continent, which a concurrence of untoward circumstances prevents our enjoying in England.” Amazement had taken entire possession of me during this speech; I was almost dedeprived of the power of utterance. At length I exclaimed “good God! how have I deserved this insult? Ungenerous man, have you forgot Mrs. Belger.” “Dear Meriel,” said he, “do not raise imaginary obstacles. You as well as all the rest of the world know I am not married to that woman.” “But you are bound to her, sir, by every tie of honour and gratitude.” “Miss Howard,” said he, gravely, “can you lay your hand upon your heart, and say you do not regard me with a sentiment more lively than friendship.” “If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it will never love whom it cannot esteem. And whatever may be its feeling I have learnt to conquer.” I could not finish what I intended to say, my tears flowed so fast they almost choaked me. “Dearest, gentlest girl,” said he, “I see the tenderness you vainly strive to hide, then come let us fly to France and insure at once both your own happiness and mine.” “What will become of your Emma,” said I, “Can you resolve to forsake your child?” “Thank you, my sweet girl, for the remembrance, she shall be the companion of our flight.” “And so drive her poor mother to distraction. No, Mr. Belger, never shall it be said of Meriel Howard, that she had by her perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an innocent woman; nor shall you forget this confiding, affectionate woman. Has she not sacrificed every consideration to you, friends, reputation, all that can render life desireable. If she is not your wife, she ought to have been so long since. And tho' you were dearer to me than the vital tide that nourishes my heart, that heart should break rather than injure her. In the midst of poverty and distress, if I can preserve my integrity unshaken, I shall still have one comfort, of which no earthly power can deprive me.” Leave me Mr. Belger, I wish to be alone. “Unkind girl to treat me thus, when it was my intention to extricate you from these impending difficulties and placed you in affluence.” “You would have degraded me to infamy, I thank your generosity.” “By heavens! Miss Howard I will marry you.” “No, Mr. Belger, that would be only using the sacred ceremony as a cloak to persidy and deceit. Leave me, sir, my resolution is sixed, and not the cruelest tortures poverty and its attendant evils can inflict shall tempt me to alter it.” I then broke from him, and going into an inner apartment fastened the door, and waited till I was certain he had left the house. Tho' I now found myself plunged in the most miserable situation, I felt a secret satisfaction in reflecting I had acted with propriety in regard to Mr. Belger, as reason plainly pointed out how little hope there could be of felicity with a man, who could, guided merely by the caprice of passion, forsake a woman so faithful, and so tender as Mrs. Belger. Religion also told me, how little I should deserve, should I be so selfish as to fix the basis of my own prosperity, on the misery of a fellow creature, “Almighty Father,” said I, “assist me with thy grace that I may be enabled to persorm my duty in every state of life, and allot me what trials thy infinite wisdom shall think proper.” I breathed this short prayer as I retired to bed, a sweet serenity came over my mind, and I enjoyed a profound sleep till near eight the next morning. I will now conclude this long letter; be assured you shall not long wait for the sequel of my melancholy tale. Your's ever MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I 2 LETTER XXXIV. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 2d, 1781. I judge of my dear Celia's impatience, by what I should feel where she in the situation in which I was, when I concluded my last: I will not trifle with you, but proceed in my narrative. The next morning I arose and went down stairs to Mr. Newtram, told him I was ready to admit the persons he had mentioned into the apartment to value the furniture, and hoped there would be more than sufficient to pay all I owed: I was continuing to speak to him, when turning my head I saw the laceman enter the shop. He pretended not to know my situation, tho' I am certain he had been sent for by Newtram, and told me a long story, to which I paid but little attention, about having a large sum to make up, &amp;c. I desired him to wait a little while, and I made no doubt but I should have sufficient to discharge his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that time think of the vast difference between selling and buying. I knew the little furniture I possessed, together with what Mr. Welldon had given me, had cost more than sixty pounds and were at present nearly as good as new. But when the man had looked them over, and taken an inventory, he offered me only thirty five guineas for the whole, in which was included my piano forte. I urged how much more they had cost me, and how little they had been used. He answered that was nothing to him; he could afford to give no more; there were some things would be of no use to him; they would lay a dead stock upon his hands, and if I did not choose to take that, it was all very well, he had rather leave them than have them. What could I do? I found I must either sell them or go to prison, and tho' I knew not by what means to support life, liberty had still some charms for me. I took the money, and turning toward my creditors, for by this time they were all assembled, laid the money on the table, and desired Mr. Newtram to pay them all as far as it would go; but they were not to be satisfied with this. “You have good cloaths, Miss Howard,” said Newtram, “you cannot expect poor people will set down quietly with their loss, and suffer you to go off with a trunk full of finery.” “Alas! sir,” said I, “the cloaths you mention are so few and composed of such indifferent materials, I did not think they would be of any value but to the owner. There are some few pices of edging, sir,” continued I, turning to the laceman, “which I must beg of you to take again.” My trunks were now brought down stairs. Mrs. Newtram chose out the best of my gowns, linen, &amp;c. which were set down at less than half their value: the edgings were produced, when to my utter astonishment, the laceman declared he would not take them without an allowance of one third of what I had paid him for them only a few months before. At length all demands were discharged, my furniture taken away, and myself left solitary in the empty rooms: I went down stairs and delivered up the keys. I had done nothing but weep all day, and had taken no kind of nourishment since my breakfast, and it was now four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Newtram did not ask me to sit down; but when I left the parlour I felt myself so sick and faint that I was obliged to sit down on the foot of the stairs, where my feelings became so poignant that I thought I should have been suffocated. Poor Betty came to me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but her own sobs were so audible as to prevent my understanding what she said: In a few moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the parlour. “Dear me, Miss Howard,” said she, “you will make yourself quite ill with fretting, and then, what is to become of you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well again, by and by; one of our young men will call you a coach, you don't consider how soon it is dark this time of the year.” “I don't want a coach,” said I, “there is nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up a few things in a handkerchief and leave the rest till I have some settled place of abode, when I will send for them.” “But it's a wet evening, child,” said she, “and a long walk to town.” “No matter, I will not have a coach.” “Perhaps, Miss Howard, you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay for one, accept these five shillings.” Celia, this vile ostentation, this shew of generosity, after she had stripped me of almost every thing, awakened my resentment. “No, Mrs. Newtram,” said I, “if I am obliged to borrow money, I have a few more cloaths left, on which I imagine I can raise it; but at present I have a few shillings, which is sufficient for this evening, to-morrow I will send for my cloaths.” She flung into the parlour, muttering something about ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold rainy evening, the latter end of October, when with a small bundle in my hand, and a load of grief at my heart, I set forward on foot from Kensington; I had not proceeded far before I heard a quick step behind me, and presently was accosted by Mr. Belger. “Where are you going my dear creature, this cold, wet night?” “I am going to town, sir, and am in haste.” “Where shall you lodge in town?” “Indeed, I do not know.” “My dear Miss Howard, you are I fear more distressed than you are willing to confess, believe me I am your friend, conside in me, I will not suffer you to want any assistance in my power to give; but we cannot conveniently consult what is best to be done, thus in the open street; step into this house, (we were just opposite an house of entertainment,) I have ordered my carriage here to take me up, and when we have had a cup of tea we will proceed to town together.” “No, sir,” said I, “it is to no purpose to solicit me, I am determined to go on to town immediately.” “Than let me call a coach, my dear girl, you must not be thus exposed to the inclemency of the weather.” “Mr. Belger, if you wish me to believe you my friend, leave me, nor thus increase my almost insupportable load of anguish, by making offers which I neither can nor will accept.” “Then let me have the pleasure of supplying you with cash till it is in your power to repay me.” This too I obstinately refused, and the rain just then increasing, he ceased his solicitations after saying I should always find a friend in him, he left me to pursue my uncomfortable walk. It was near seven o'clock, when I arrived in town, with only a few shillings in my pocket no friend to apply to and entirely at a loss how to dispose of myself that night, as the people in London are fearful of taking strangers into their houses, without a proper recommendation; not having sufficient resolution to apply to any house for a lodging I kept walking on till I came to the strand, where, just as I was passing a large haberdasher's shop, a carriage overturned, the horses took fright, and I ran with many others into the shop, for safety; I had not been there above five minutes, before I heard a female voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I am certain it is Miss Howard; the lady had now come close up to me, and on raising my eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady whom I had once or twice seen at my aunts. Shall I confess, that shame at being seen in so draggled a condition was the first sensation I felt, however, Amelia soon made me forget that, when kindly taking my hand in the soft voice of affection, she said, “my dear Miss Howard, where have you hid yourself all this time;” then observing my wet cloak and bonnet, she continued: “You have been walking in the rain my love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave to set you down wherever you wish to go.” The soothing voice of tenderness as soon wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as does the churlish voice of chiding, but then the one drops gently, while the softest sensations pervade the soul, the other is the source of such real anguish, that memory will retain the pain they occasion for years afterwards. I could not answer the kind miss Sidney, but followed her in silence to the coach, when we were seated she again renewed her question, “where will you be set down?” The anguish of my heart now burst out, and I cried, I have no home: all places are alike to me, “then you shall go home with me,” said Amelia. “Oh Miss Sidney,” said I, “do not think by thus accpting your kind offer of stepping into the coach I mean to throw myself on your benevolence, my only motive was to have an opportunity of enquiring whether you could recommend me to any place, where I might lodge for a little time, till I could consider how to dispose of myself in future. Favour me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed I have no friends in the world, who interests themselves the least in my welfare.” She pressed my hand and after softly saying, “be comfored, my dear,” remained silent, till the coach stopped, she then assisted me to alight, and leading me up stairs left me a few moments in the drawing room; but soon returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney received me with the chearful smile of an old friend, and Amelia brought a change of cloaths which she insisted on my putting on. Supper soon came in. The manner which Mrs. Sidney and her daughter observed towards me, was delicate and attentive in the extreme. Not a word scaped them that had the least appearance of curiosity; they seemed to treat me as tho' I had been paying an expected visit, and to consider my company as an obligation; when the cloath was removed, I told my amiable hostess, I thought it but right she should know by what means I became reduced to so distrest a condition, but Amelia stopped me. “Dear Miss Howard,” said she, “if it is in our power to serve you, do not hesitate to point out Vol. II. K the way, and you will not find us backward in performing it; but I insist that you do not enter into explanations which may be painful to you. You have no doubt been unfortunate, as such and knowing the excellence of your heart, you have a claim upon my friendship, I am ready to prove myself your sincere well wisher, but I have no right to enter into a minute investigation of your past conduct.” “But, my dear lady,” said I, “it is absolutely necessary, you should be acquainted with many past incidents of my life, that you may better concieve my present situation and be enabled to favour me with your advice, for my future conduct. “Well, my dear,” said Mrs. Sidney, “whatever you think proper,” “I thank heaven madam,” said I, “tho' I shall shall acquaint you with many errors, some of which I tremble but to think on, (for at that moment, Celia, I remembered my impious despondency, and the divine interposition of providence which delivered me at the very moment, when to avoid temporal misery I was rushing into guilt.) Yet I have done nothing to make me ashamed, and tho' my reputation has been sullied. “We have all our errors, Miss Howard,” said Amelia, “and we all hope to have those errors forgiven, then should we not be always ready to forgive the errors of our fellow creatures. Come my dear girl let me persuade you to drop the subject, whatever have been your errors I am sure you now renounce them, and whatever are your misfortunes we will strive to aleviate, if we cannot entirely remove them.” “You are very good, Miss Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will not detain you long.” I then in as few words as possible comprised the whole of my sufferings, not even endeavouring to veil my errors, from the time of my father's imprisonment, till the present day; she listened with attention, and taking my hand said, “Conviction sits on your countenance, I will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel, because it has been delivered with such ingenious frankness that to hear is to believe; but you have been strangely misrepresented, by those whose duty it was to defend rather than asperse your character.” She then informed me that the Mossops had propogated the most malignant censures against me, and from at first pointing me out as an object of ridicule to entertain their friends, at length represented me as fit only for their contempt. In short, folly, ignorance, hypocrisy, and profligacy, had been set forward, as the most striking traits in my character, and at the very moment when Amelia met me, she supposed me sunk into infamy and shame. “But,” said she, “I saw you was unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to remember the faults, when an opportunity offers, wherein we may be of service to a person in distress, I am now more than ever convinced of the propriety of such a mode of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I should never have known how much Miss Howard had been injured, and how little her unworthy friends deserved such a relative, but I beg,” continued she, “you will consider yourself at home. Believe me, you are as welcome as a sister, and whenever you hear of a situation which you think will suit you, my mother and I will give you every necessary recommendation, but do not be in a hurry to leave us, we shall not soon be tired of your company.” She then shewed me to a neat bed-chamber adjoining her own, and wishing me a good nights reposse, left me. And who is this benevolent girl? methinks I hear you say. She is, my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who by industry in a respectable line of business, brought up a numerous family in a reputable manner. He lived to see his sons well settled in the world, and had saved enough to leave at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only daughter a comfortable independence. Amelia had a genteel, but yet useful education, she was equally qualified to shine in public or private life, she preferred the latter. Her mother's happiness constituted her own, she read to her, worked with her, confidered her peace as the main spring for all her actions, and loved her with a tender respect bordering on devotion. Yet with a pleasing graceful peron, a lively disposition, and a large share of good sense, has this amiable girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one offer of marriage, she has had many lovers, but she declares they all deserted their colours, when they understood, she would have no fortune till the death of her mother. “So you see, my dear,” said she, one day smiling “I am destined to wear the willow as long as I live.” More shame for the male world if she is, Celia, for I think I could venture to pronounce him a happy man, who should be so fortunate as to obtain such a wife. I have been in this kind family, now near a month, but have not as yet heard of any thing, that I think will suit, tho' I am determined to take almost any situation rather than remain a burthen upon the benevolence of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they have sufficient for all the comforts and some of the elegancies of life, I am sure, cannot assord to have me constantly with them. I sent for the rest of my cloaths the day after I left Kensington, but received no message K 2 from thence, nor have I heard a syllable of Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the credit of not wishing it. I even gave the person who went for my things a strict charge, not to mention in what part of the town I resided. March 3d. A lady called this evening at Mrs. Sidney's, who said she had heard of a place which she thought would suit me: it is to be companion to an elderly lady in the country, to read to her, walk with her help entertain her company and attend a little to the domestic concerns of the family. The salary, I find, is but small, that shall be no objection, I never was extravagant in dress, and I think I shall hardly begin now. I am to go to-morrow morning at ten o'clock to speak to a lady, who is a distant relation of Mrs. Rooksby, and who has been desired by her to look out for the kind of person she wants. I wish I may be so lucky as to succeed in this application, as I trust I could render myself agreeable to the old lady, and I would likewise exert myself to be useful. The mail goes to-morrow, before I shall have time to write again, but my Celia, may depend on my seizing the first opportunity, to let her know my success. Adieu, my beloved friend, tho' I can never love you less, you must be henceforth content, to share with the generous truely benevolent Amelia the affections of your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXV. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 12th, 1781. Celia, my beloved Celia, when is my heart to be at rest, when shall I say, “peace dwells in my bosom, its anxieties are hushed, doubt, fear, and incertitude, are no more.” Alas! I fear Meriel will never feel that heavenly satisfaction, 'till shuddering on the verge of eternity, she fixes her hope on the verge of eternity, she sixes her hope on things immortal, immutable and unchangeable. But forgive me my friend, when I took up my pen, I meant not to complain, indeed I did not, I am fully sensible if my blessings were measured only according to my demerits, I should be poor indeed, but our heavenly father, portions out our comforts according to the measure of his love. Alas! if our deserts were only considered, who would dare abide the decision; friendship is his choicest best gift, and have I not found that pure and un-alloyed in the breasts of Celia and Amleia. As to love; It is an empty sound, The haughty fair one's jest On earth unseen or only found To warm the turtles nest. Oh yes there is love on earth; sincere, tender, affectionate, faithful, ardent hearts, but they were not formed for me, Celia; and I must learn submission without repining, you wonder what all this means, I cannot tell you just now; when I am more composed I will resume my pen. How strange does it appear that I should be an object of malice or envy to others, who never harboured a wish to the prejudice, or envied the good fortune of any one. The morning after I sent off my last, my dear Celia, I dressed myself neat but very plain, and at ten o'clock found myself at the door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden square, the servant, who opened it, told me his lady was not come down: he begged I would wait in a parlour, where there was a fire, and brought me a newspaper to amuse me. In about twenty minutes, he returned and defired me to walk up stairs. I followed him into a back drawing room, where an elegant woman sat preparing to make tea, and a nurse was in the room with a very young child. The lady arose and received me with every mark of politeness; but I was scarcely seated before a voice struck my ears, which vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face glow, but had not a moment for thought, before the door opened, and Rainsforth entered the room holding a boy about twelve months old in his arms. Surprise threw me entirely off my guard, I gave a sudden shriek and fainted. What passed during my indisposition I cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found the lady sitting beside me on the sopha, applying volatiles to my nose and temples, while a maid servant stood by with water, but neither Rainsforth or the children were in the room. “Are you subject to these ill turns, my dear miss?” said the lady. “No madam,” said I, “but sudden surprise will sometimes serve me thus.” “Do you know Mr. Kingly? Was it his presence that caused such violent emotions?” “Only that you call him Kingly, madam, I should say the gentleman who came in just now was a Mr. Rainsforth, of Plymouth.” “Is your name Howard?” said the lady visibly agitated. I answered in the affirmative. “Then,” said she, “I can account for the exclamation with which he left the room. You are right in your conjectures Miss Howard, Rainsforth and Kingly are one and the same person. He took my name on our union, of which I suppose you were unacquainted. “I was indeed, a stranger to it, madam, or I should not have presumed to have intruded here; pardon the involuntary confusion I have occasioned, and permit me to retire.” “You are not as yet sufficiently recovered,” said she, “to venture out. Pray, stop, and compose yourself, and if it will not occasion a return of your disorder, we will send for Mr. Kingly to take his breakfast.” I was beginning to apologize for the disagreeable interruption I had given, but she stopped me. “I shall not listen to a syllable of excuse. I am sure it was unintentional, but I will not forgive it on any other terms than its never being mentioned in future.” Kingly, as I must henceforth call him, was now summoned to breakfast, I endeavoured to command my countenance; but I fear to little effect; I attempted to rise, when he entered the room, but my limbs refused their office. He bowed and took his seat in silence, a cup of tea was handed him: his hand trembled so he could not raise it to his mouth. I did not dare lift my eyes, least I should encounter his, I felt my face alternately red and pale; and it was with difficulty I could restrain my tears. We were all silent for near five minutes. Mrs. Kingly seemed the least embarrassed of the three, and at length ventured to say, “my dear Kingly you forget your politeness to day, pray help Miss Howard to some muffin.” “I believe,” said he, “it is by some other name we must address this lady now.” Surprise at what he uttered tempted me to raise my eyes with a kind of inquisitive look.” “My name is still Howard,” said I, “nor have the least intention of altering it.” “Were you not on the point of being married about two years since?” I was more astonished than ever at this question. I knew not what to answer: to have mentioned any thing of my intended union with Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have only served to make her unhappy. At length I answered, I was, it is true, near being married about that time, but I had every reason to suppose you, as well as the rest of my acquaintance, knew the cause of the match being broke off. I have never had a thought since of altering my condition. “It is very strange,” said he, and the conversation dropped. I then began to recollect the reason which had brought me to the house of a man whom I wished, of all others, most to avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the necessary enquiries concerning the place I wanted to engage for. Having received answers greatly to my satisfaction, I arose to take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney for my character. “I dare say there will be no necessity to make those enquiries,” said she, “but if you will mention any day when you will favour me with your company to dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who is fortunately now in town.” I told her if she would favour me so far, as to give me a line to Mrs. Rooksby, I would wait on that lady at any time she would please to appoint, but must beg leave to decline the proposed honour of dining with her, as I feared it would not be possible to disengage myself from the kind friends with whom I at present resided, till an absolute settlement obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear Celia, I felt there would be a great impropriety in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy with Mrs. Kingly, for should she not have been acquainted with the connection that formerly subsisted between her husband and myself, and should by any means hereafter hear of it, she might naturally suppose I cultivated her acquaintance, that I might the more easily enjoy her husband's society; and if, as I suspect, she already knows how near we were being united by the tenderest ties, she would certainly approve a conduct, which would shew how much her happiness was preferred to my own gratification. I will consess I wished for nothing more than a conversation with Kingly, for I plainly perceived some mystery couched beneath the few sentences that passed, while we were at breakfast: But this wish I was sensible would be both improper and imprudent to seek to gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore named a day, when she thought it would be convenient for her aunt to see me, and mentioned an hour when she would call and take me to her, I took my leave. I slightly regarded Kingly's countenance, as I wished him good morning, and discovered in it strong traits of wonder and impatience. When I teturned to Mrs. Sidney's, Amelia discovered by my looks the agitation of my mind. I thought it would be wrong to have Vol. II. L any concealments from such worthy friends, I therefore briefly related all that concerned Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter with him that morning. “Upon my word, Meriel,” said she, “every word you utter excites fresh wonder. I remember hearing of the affair you mention, but it was always spoken of in such a ludicrous strain, that I have myself frequently joined in the laugh against you, considering you as a poor, fond girl, who fancied every man who but spoke a civil word was in love with you, and returned this imaginary passion with all the enthusiastic ardor of romantic affection.” I made Miss Sidney no answer, but going to my trunk, returned with all the letters which had passed between Rainsforth and myself. “This proof of your fortitude and magnanimity,” said she, when she had perused them, “was only wanting to complete my esteem for your character; for, it is from these letters only, that I have learnt in what manner you disposed of your fortune. Generous, noble spirited girl, it is only for such hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of affliction; but surely heaven has some future reward in store, that will amply compensate the sufferings you are ordained to endure.” “Oh! my dear Amelia,” said I, “have I not already an ample compensation in your friendship and affection. Praises from your lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I never forfeit your esteem.” “That I am sure you never will. I only blush to think how long I remained a stranger to your merits; but the real diamond is always enveloped in a crust, thro' which it is only on near inspection, we can discover its intrinsic value.” “Ah! flatterer,” said I, smiling, while the tear of grateful affection stole from my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the friendship of Amelia Sidney, the benefits received from her hands, the misery from which she snatched me, may I be forgot by that Providence to whom we can only look for support. Bless her, all-bounteous heaven; make her felicity as boundless as the benevolence of her heart; let her comforts be many, and her afflictions few: and when this transitory scene is past, soft and gentle be her passage to the grave. May she “Peaceful sleep out the sabbath of the tomb, “And wake to raptures in a life to come.” Pope. And may you, my dear Celia, share the same envied fate. For me, I was born to bustle on a sea of trouble; and so as the busfetting waves do not deprive me of the support held out by the heavenly cherub Hope, I have still a comfort remaining, that will bear me up under all my troubles, and lead me to a harbour of eternal rest. Adieu, my friend, I will continue my narrative in a few days. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXVI. MERIEL to CELIA. London, March 14th, 1781. Knowing, my dear Celia's impatience to be informed of what followed my interview in Golden-Square, I shall proceed without any preface. After the conversation I mentioned in my last, it struck Amelia that Kingly would undoubtedly endeavour to see me, as his mind must be in the same state of painful uncertainty in regard to my conduct, as I was, when I reflected on his. I told her I would by no means wish to see him, and requested the servant might be permitted to deny me in case any gentleman should call. Our measures were but just settled when a knock at the door announced a visitor, and by listning at the top of the stair-case, I plainly heard Kingly's voice. He seemed much disappointed at not finding me at home, and left word he would call at twelve o'clock the next day: accordingly I wrote the following note to be delivered when he came. TO MR. KINGLY. MISS HOWARD's compliments to Mr. Kingly; requests as a particular favour, he will not give himself the trouble to call any more, as Mr. Kingly cannot be ignorant, that there are many forcible reasons existing, which renders it totally improper for Miss H. to recieve his visits. She desires no explanation of past incidents; sincerely wishes Mr. K. every felicity; but is certain any intercourse between them, will not tend to promote it. It is that reason only, which urges Miss H. to avoid an intimacy with L 2 the very amiable Mrs. Kingly, whose happiness, she devoutly prays may be permanent, and of long duration. When he came, this note was delivered to him by the servant. He asked for pen and ink, and left the following. TO MISS HOWARD. I AM convinced I have been decieved; an explanation is absolutely necessary to my repose. I find you are the same charming, delicate girl, I once adored; nay, which even at this moment I find dearer to my heart, than aught the world contains beside. Then, think not, I will sit tamely down, while you suppose me an unfeeling, capricious monster. There is one way, by which I can clear myself; there is one, who can plead my cause, and you not refuse to listen. I respect that sense of propriety, which urges you to refuse a personal interview; but I must be restored to your esteem, or be wretched for ever. Your friend, F. KINGLY. The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as she had appointed, and took me with her in the chariot to Mrs. Rooksby. This old lady is extremely pleasing in her manner. Her person, tho' advanced in years, retains many traces of grace and elegance. She expressed her approbation of me, in the politest terms, and said, she should consider herself extremely fortunate in the acquisition of such a companion. Her terms were much more liberal than I had been led to expect; and as we were soon agreed, she requested me to appoint an early day for my removal to her house. “Business of a very particular nature,” said she, “required my presence in London, which I have not visited before for upwards of twenty years, nor shall I now remain in it long; but while I do stay, I shall wish to enter into a few of its amusements, and I am certain I shall receive double satisfaction from them all, when I am favoured with your company.” It was then determined, that day week should be the time of my removal, and we took our leave. When I was again in the carriage with Mrs. Kingly, she said, “it gives me great pleasure to find my aunt is likely to make so agreeable an addition to her family; nor have I the least doubt, but you will be satisfied with your situation, as she is a woman of an easy, chearful disposition. And now my dear Miss Howard, as we have settled this important business, you must give me leave to execute a commission, I yesterday undertook. I have a letter for you,” continued she, smiling. “You may perhaps guess from whom. Come, no drawing back, I can assure you there will not be the least impropriety in your recieving it, and I flatter myself I have interest sufficient to obtain an answer.” She then put the letter into my hand. You may judge my confusion. It was impossible to speak, for I was utterly at a loss what to say. I believe, I never looked more like a fool. Mrs. Kingly saw my embarrassment, and kindly, did not seem to expect me to speak, but began a conversation on things quite foreign to the subject. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's door, she refused to alight; but wishing me a good day, said, she should expect to hear from me soon. I ran up stairs to Amelia, and putting the letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it for me, for indeed I have not resolution to read it myself. Enclosed my dear Celia, is a copy of the letter; also of one from Mrs. Kingly, in which it was enclosed; when you have perused them, I am sure you will lament with your poor friend, that such merit as Rainsforth's, (for still I love that name,) should be severed from her, by the malice of those, who could really reap no advantage from her disappointment. Whatever were the motives, that instigated the Mossops to practice such an imposition on us both, they are undoubtedly disappointed; for from the time of Rainsforth's marriage with Miss Kingly he carefully avoided all intercourse with the family; the reasons for which you will find in his letter. I think when you have read, you will admire Mrs. Kingly as much as you pity your MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXVII. MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD. March 9th, 1781. I feel, my dear Miss Howard, that I am under an indispensible necessity of writing to you, to request you will attend to the explanation so ardently desired by Mr. Kingly; and from which your rigid sense of propriety, urges you to recede: but in what manner shall I address you, dear, amiable young lady, when I am sensible I have, tho' unknowingly, stepped between you and happiness. Often have I heard your name, oft listened to your commendations, from lips which never spoke, but they conveyed pleasure to my heart. My father's family lived in terms of the greatest intimacy with that of Mr. Rainsforth's; Frederic and myself were nearly of the same age, were frequently together, we learnt to dance at the same school, and at our annual ball I was always selected for his partner. Our infantine attachment was noticed by both our parents, and Frederic was often smilingly called my little husband. As we increased in years, this attachment grew weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my bosom it gathered new strength; the many good qualities so conspicuous in the boy, became dignified virtues in the bosom of the man. I always wept when duty called him from his native place, and rejoiced unfeignedly at his return. When my uncle made me his heiress, my parents began to shew some disapprobation of my visible partiality; and when I repeatedly refused the most splendid offers, treated my passion with a rigour, which served only to make its impression on my heart more indeliable. Just before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the misfortune, which was, I understand, the first cause of your separation from his son. I lost both my parents within a very short period of each other, and became my own mistress: I know not how to proceed, I am at a loss for words, in which I can acknowledge a weakness, which I fear you will condemn; but anxious to restore peace to the bosom of Rainsforth and prosperity to his family; and perfectly unacquainted with his engagements to the amiable Miss Howard, I so far overstepped the bounds prescribed our sex, as to write to him making a tender of myself and fortune: instead of writing an answer to this letter, he came himself, thanked me in the tenderest manner for what he termed my generous designs in his favour; but declared his heart was under a prior engagement. He then expiated largely on the virtues of Miss Howard, and declared, tho' for the present, fortune had placed insuperable barriers to obstruct your union, he should ever hold himself as bound to you, and while you remained single, consider himself not at liberty to marry any other woman. He requested that tho' unable to accept the offered honour of my hand, he might not be deprived of my friendship, and declared he should always think on me with gratitude and affection. From this time I sedulously endeavoured to conquer a passion, which I found preyed upon my peace of mind, and when I heard of the fortune left his family flattered myself I had succeded: I sincerely rejoiced in the prospect of his felicity in an union with you, which he told me would now soon be compleated: but one morning he came to me in visible agitation, and taking my hand, cried, “dear Margaret, I am disappointed in my tenderest hopes, Meriel Howard is married.” I tried to persuade him he had been misinformed; but he said there was no room for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your own hand. He now visited me every day, and I will confess to you, I exerted myself to divert his melancholy; I in some measure succeeded; and one day as we were chatting together on indifferent subjects, he suddenly caught my hand and cried, “if my lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart that was once devoted to another, happiness might yet be my portion; but I dare not indulge so sweet a hope.” I will not repeat to you, Miss Howard, the many conversations we had on this subject; suffice it to say we were soon united. From that happy moment, his tenderness, his assiduity, has every day increased: I saw his heart still beat true to its first attachment; but I also saw his struggles to suppress its emotions. He never indulged himself in talking of you, carefully avoiding every place where he might chance to hear your name mentioned. The violent agitation, which you was thrown into by his entering the room the other morning, and an exclamation which broke from him, as he caught you, when you were falling to the ground, made me readily conceive who it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for you both, more than I can express: I had long been acquainted with your virtues, though a Vol. II. M stranger to your person, and I wished earnestly for power to aleviate sufferings, of which I considered myself the cause. I easily understood your generous motive for declining visiting at my house. I esteem, I venerate you for it, tho' I am certain no ill consequence could ensue from an intimacy between two hearts so chaste, so much under the guidance of religion and honour, as your's and Mr. Kingly's. The day after I first had the pleasure of seeing you, I perceived Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and absent. I pressed to know the cause. He was at first embarrassed; at length he candidly told me he wished much for a conversation with you, to clear up some mysteries which at present tormented him beyond measure; that he had called on you twice, but you absolutely refused to see him. He then shewed me your note, and asked, if he were to write a few lines, whether I would prevail with you to read them, and grant him an answer. I readily promised him to comply with this request, and I hope, my dear Miss Howard, you will by an answer, restore peace to his bosom; for I am well convinced, he will never be happy while he imagines you think him unworthy your regard. I am, dear young lady, with every sentiment of esteem, and every kind wish for your happiness, Your friend in sincerity, M. KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXVIII. MR. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD. March 9th, 1781. That you are still unmarried, my dear Meriel, is to me the cause of great astonishment; that you are depressed in your circumstances, and obliged to seek by servitude the necessary means to support life, gives the accutest pangs to a heart, that ever wished and would have rejoiced in your hap piness. I fear we have both been deceived; but why that deceit has been practised against us, I am at a loss to think. I know you never were a favourite with the Mossop's. They envied virtues they had not spirit to imitate; but why they should thus labour to render two unoffending beings so completely miserable, is altogether unaccountable. I have, my dear friend, (the blush of shame crimsons my cheek while I write it) but I have doubted your virtues. I have thought you false, capricious, light and undeserving: and much I fear, you have been taught to think me the vilest of my sex. But let me hasten to exculpate myself from so black a charge. Let me trace back to the time that even at this moment my soul shudders to think upon. Let me lead your ideas back to the letter[1] [1] See Vol, I. p. 152. I wrote informing you of the happy change in my father's fortune. I was hastily preparing to come to London, from which place unavoidable business had detained me much longer than my impatience could well brook; when one morning I met young Mossop, who at that time belonged to a ship lying at Plymouth. After the usual salutations, he asked me if I had that morning any letters from London. I replied, I had been from home all the morning. You will, no doubt, on your return, find letters, said he; for I have just heard from Hester, who mentions having seen her cousin, and that she was employed in writing to you. My heart sunk, my dear Meriel, at this intelligence; for, as in my letter I had mentioned the time I should leave Plymouth, I did not expect an answer, and naturally thought, it must have been something particular had occasioned your writing. I left Mossop and instantly returned home; where I found a letter, the contents of which had nearly fired my brain. It is indeliably imprinted on my memory; it can never be forgotten. These were the words: SIR, THE receipt of your last favour, occasioned a mixture of both pain and pleasure in my bosom. I was extremely happy to hear of your increase of fortune; but pained to find you still retained your partiality for me. Absence, my good sir, and a variety of incidents, has entirely obliterated from my heart, every trace, of what I once called love. But I find I was deceived, in supposing myself actuated by that passion. I shall ever remember Mr. Rainsforth with the most grateful esteem; but my heart, and M 2 all its tenderest affections, are devoted to another object; to whom, to-morrow morning I mean to plight my faith, in the most solemn manner. I imagined a knowledge of this event, would prevent your intended journey to the metropolis. I should be greatly obliged, if you would seal up all my letters and give them to my cousin Mossop, who will send them to town in a parcel to his sister. At the same time, please to inform me whether you would wish yours to be returned, or whether I have your permission to consign them to eternal oblivion. I sincerely wish you may meet with a woman, more calculated to make you happy, than was the woman, who now, for the last time, signs herself, MERIEL HOWARD. I cannot give you the least idea of the poignancy o my feelings, or the madness of my actions, at this cruel, insulting letter. I was absolutely frantic: my father endeavoured to sooth me. He had always expressed a dislike at my proposed union with you, tho' for what reason I never could learn. He told me I ought to rejoice at having discovered your light, changeable disposition, before it was in your power to injure my honour. I listned to him with reverence; I knew he never yet had expressed a wish, which did not ultimately tend to my good: I endeavour to calm my transports, and strove to persuade myself I should soon hate you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I gave vent to the anguish of my heart. I then sealed up all the dear pledges of your affection, and which till that moment had been preserved as the choicest treasures I possessed, and went to seek Mossop. “You did not tell me,” said I, “your cousin Meriel was married.” “Dear Rainsforth,” said he, “I had not courage to inform you of her perfidy, as I knew you loved the unworthy girl.” “She has desired,” said I, “to have her letters returned; here they are: you are to send them to your sister. Oh! Mossop, I could not have believed Meriel Howard”—“I am sorry,” said he, interrupting me, “I had not before warned you of her disposition. She always was of a fickle temper, I could have told you of many instances of her levity of heart, which she so effectually hides under an affectation of sentiment and reserve; but you were so bigoted to her, you would not have believed my assertions.” He then told me, you were once attached to a married man, one Pringle, whom he was intimate with in London; that you eloped from your father's house, and it was to be feared you had reason to repent your rashness. “Consummate hypocrite,” said I. “But from this moment I erase her from my heart; I will never suffer myself to mention her name; I will be happy, spite of her cruel arts to undermine my peace.” From that time I carefully avoided, even the society of Mossop, least I should hear your name, and be tempted to break my resolves; and in a very short time I yeilded to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom you have seen, and whom I am sure you love; for her soul is congenial with your own. Meriel, I will not pretend to say I had forgot you; but the engaging qualities of my wife, the innocent beauties of my children had in a great measure, filled that void in my heart, which the loss of you had occasioned. Indeed, I had began to fancy myself happy, when your presence and sudden illness, the other morning, awakened my long stifled tenderness, convinced me I had been deceived, and that we both were destined to be miserable. My wife, the best, the kindest of her sex, see's my sufferings, and generously pitties them. Ah! my dear friend, how are thosesufferings augmented, when I reflect that the anguish which oppresses me, is conveyed to her gentle bosom, and she pines in secret at the want of that ardent affection, which would constitute the whole happiness of her life. She has promised me, to deliver this to your hands; matchless tenderness! let her soft pleadings prevail my dear Miss Howard; write to me, if it is but one line, to say you do not quite despise me. Tell me also, whether you wrote that cruel letter; and if you did, what were your reasons for it. But, ah! it is impossible, you are the same charming, amiable woman, I once adored beyond life, and whose image only the pang that disolves every tie of nature, can erase from my heart. Oh! Margret, thou much esteemed woman, pardon these involuutary wanderings of my pen, I would die rather than injure you: this once forgive my wayward heart, and henceforth my every hour of life shall be devoted to thee. Meriel, dear lost Meriel, if you wish to save me from distraction, write one line of comfort to the wretched F. KINGLY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.) CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the poignancy of my feelings when I had read this horrid detail of the imposition that had been practised, thus to ruin the peace of Kingly and myself. Hester Mossop was the person, my suspicions rested on, yet why she should endeavour to undermine my happiness, when it would by no means conduce either to her interest or felicity remains still an inexplicable riddle. I cannot tell you how often I read the dear letter which undecieved me, in regard to Kingly's conduct; how often I pressed it to my heart, and bathed it in my tears: amiable youth, charming engaging woman, cried I, as I alternately read the letters of Frederic and his Margaret; may your happiness be as complete as you are deserving: never will Meriel abuse the confidence you have placed in her. My resolution in what manner to conduct myself was soon formed. I determined to answer Kingly's letter, and to commit it unsealed to the care of his amiable wife; I laid my projected plan before the friendly Amelia, and finding it met her approbation, immediately sat down to put it in execution; the following is a copy of my letter to Kingly. MISS HOWARD to MR. KINGLY. SIR, HAD not the letter I have just perused been written in your hand, and delivered to me by Mrs. Kingly, I should be tempted to think some whining school boy had tried the extent of his genius in its composition. In the name of common sense, my good friend, to what do these piteous complaints tend, or from whence do they proceed? are you not the husband of a woman, every way calculated to make the connubial state a state of bliss? have you not two lovely children, the pledges of her tenderest affections; and has not Providence bountifully showered its favours on you? have you not health, ease and plenty? and yet simple mortal, that you are, do you complain and sigh, because you were not permitted to unite your fate with one, who, if you knew her half so well as I do, you would find entirely destitute of many of those amiable qualities which so eminently distinguish Mrs. Kingly. For shame Kingly, for shame, you almost tempt me to laugh; your present conduct is like that of a spoilt child, who having in his possession every valuable elegant toy his indulgent parents can procure him, by chance discovers an insignificant trifle, which at some past period had amused his fancy; but being now out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars, throws from him with wild impetuosity, those already in his possession, and with the right, wayward spirit of contradiction refuses to be pacified. You are mistaken in supposing young Mossop decieved you in regard to my character; nature formed me thoughtless, volatile and capricious: It is true, while you remained with me, I restrained my natural levity; but no sooner were you absent than I relapsed into my former folly, and innumerable are the giddy inconsistent actions I have committed; among which, no doubt you will reckon my writing such an unaccountable letter, merely to try the strength of your passion; to be sure, I did not think you would have resented it so highly; but when I found that my folly was the means of promoting your interest, I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once wished to recall the transaction. You are in another error in supposing me unhappy. I am one of those thoughtless, inconsiderate beings, who seldom lay any thing long to heart. My fortune is gone, it is true; but, it was disposed of in such a way, as I can never repent. My health and spirits are still unimpaired; then consider, my good friend, how little I have to regret, how much to be thankful for. It has struck me, since our interview in Golden-Square, that you might, perhaps, imagine my illness was occasioned by your sudden appearance. Do not encourage that idea; it is a false one. I am sometimes subject to those kind of fits; and they generally seize me without a moment's warning. I flatter myself you will now be satisfied. Be assured, there is nothing can give me greater pleasure, than to see you and the lovely woman to whom your fate is united, enjoy uninterrupted felicity; for volatile and giddy as I am, I have yet a heart that exults in the prosperity of every surrounding object. Believe me, Kingly, true felicity is placed within your reach, take the proffered blessing, and enjoy it with gratitude, nor let your own discontented fancies dash with gall the cup which Providence presents, overflowing with joy and peace. From the tenor of your letter, I should think you a hero of romance, lamenting in pathetic strains the disappointment of his first love. Pr'ythee, my good friend, shake off the boy, assume the man of sense, and learn to estimate true happiness, not by the inconsistent wishes of Vol. II. N your wayward heart, but by its own intrinsic value. Adieu, and believe me your sincere well wisher. MERIEL HOWARD. I will not pretend to tell you, what pain it cost me, my dear Celia, to write a letter so foreign to my feelings: to be obliged, as it were, to accuse myself of folly and inconsistency; that would render me contemptible in the eyes of the only man, to whom I wished to appear amiable. But there was no other way to restore his peace, there was no other way to preserve the happiness of a woman, who not only loved him with the most enthusiastic passion, but had placed an unbounded confidence in me, and shewn a friendship for me, which I should have ceased to deserve, could I once have been so mean as to envy her the possession of the man, who constituted the whole of her earthly felicity. But tho' I wished Kingly to remain in his error, I could not bear to be thought meanly of by this dear woman; I therefore took an opportunity, when I thought it most likely he would not be at home, and waited on Mrs. Kingly. I gave her the letter, but at the same time told her, tho' I wished her husband to think my assertions true, I hoped she would kindly believe I was not indeed the very inconsistent character I had represented myself, I then presented to her a paper, briefly containing every circumstance which had passed between Kingly and myself, and enclosing the letter I had received, as I imagined, from his father. She read them with attention, and then declared it was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing; said she knew his hand perfectly well, and also, that he was a man incapable of writing so inhuman a letter. “That there has been a strange deception practised, is very evident, my dear madam,” said I, “but I make no doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly, as he would undoubtedly think as an officer and as a man of honour, he was under a necessity of resenting the ungenerous conduct of Mr. Mossop.” “Dear, considerate girl,” said she, taking my hand, “how do you contrive to rise every moment higher in my esteem. It appears a degree of cruelty to suffer Mr. Kingly to retain such an erroneous opinion of your conduct.” “But I must insist, my dear madam,” said I, “on your keeping my secret. Remember it was on the promise of inviolable silence alone that I entrusted you.” “But,” cried she, tenderly, “I fear you are unhappy.” “Indeed, I am not,” I replied. “Since those occurrences I have just related to you, I have had so many trials, so many heavy afflictions, that I had seldom thought on Mr. Rainsforth within these last two years, except it was to rejoice, that by not being united to me, he had escaped a large share of sorrow, as he would unavoidably have taken a part in all my afflictions.” “Ah! deceiver,” said she, smiling, “you cannot persuade me, that the heart once tenderly attached to such a man as Kingly, can so easily regain its tranquility. “But you do not reflect, my dear madam, that I thought him a false hearted swain, and strove with a laudable pride to banish him from my remembrance.” “True,” she replied, “but you are now undeceived.” “Well, but believe me, it was too late to awaken the long stifled passion. My heart is just in the situation it was before I saw him. Nay, I really think it is easier; for I am now convinced that he is not altogether unworthy the happiness that awaits him.” I then purposely changed the conversation, enquired when she had seen her aunt, and how long that lady thought of remaining in town. “I long to go into the country,” said I, “for there never was a woman so passionately fond of still life as I am; I doat on a gloomy grotto; and a moonlight night, with a nightingale under my window, and a streamlet just near enough for its murmurs to be agreeable, fills me with delight.” “You are of a melancholy turn then,” said she. “By no means,” I replied, “I am the chearfulest creature breathing when free from noise and bustle; but if you wish to see me completely stupid, usher me into a crowded drawing-room, my faculties immediately take their flight, and I appear what I am in reality, a mere cypher to fill up the number of the company.” “I wish,” said she, “our house in Devonshire was near my aunt's, I should, I am very certain, pass many a happy hour in your society.” “You are at a great distance from her then?” “So far, that we seldom meet above once in a year.” This information pleased me, you may be sure, my dear Celia, for I wish not to be often in company with Kingly. However, I did not express my satisfaction, and Mrs. Kingly continued. “Even when I do visit Mrs. Rooksby, I take an opportunity when Mr. Kingly is from home: for he has such an invincible aversion to her son, that he will never, if he can possibly N 2 avoid it, spend an hour in his company.” “Does Mr. Rooksby live with his mother?” said I. “Not in general, but in the summer season he frequently makes her a visit of some months continuance, especially if his finances run short. Clement,” continued she, “is not a bad hearted lad, but he is thoughtless and extravagant; and what offends Mr. Kingly so highly is, he has an intrigue with a woman supposed to be married. Her influence over him is astonishing, and her extravagance knows no bounds; the connection, I believe, has been of long duration; but he has not publicly avowed it till within these two months. Business for his mother took him to the continent, and when he returned she accompanied him.” “It is a great pity,” said I. But at that moment hearing Kingly's voice in the hall, I arose to take my leave; and as he entered the room I left it. To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her worthy mother, and enter into Mrs. Rooksby's family. I am happy to find her son is not much at home, as I have met with so many vexations from the unmeaning assiduities of the men, that I wish to avoid as much as possible all intercourse with the sex: for except Kingly, I can hardly believe there is a good one in the world. There was another, Celia, but he is now no more. Dear shade of the benevolent, disinterested Welldon, if from thy blissful abode thou couldst, now look down, and behold the heart thy virtue snatched from ruin, thou wouldst see it overflowing with such grateful remembrance, such veneration and affection, as nothing but the hand of death can extinguish. Adieu! my dear Celia, I will write again when I can tell you how I like my situation. MERIEL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXXIX. MERIEL to CELIA. London, April 20th, 1781. I have now been in this family nearly a month, and feel myself as happy as you can imagine, by contrasting my present with my late friendless and desolate condition. Mrs. Rooksby has seen a good deal of company since I have been with her, and goes frequently into public. I find, my dear Celia, that sensibility is not always an object of ridicule; for Mrs. Rooksby and Mrs. Kingly can shed tears at a tragedy without endeavouring to conceal, or blush for their weakness. I have received several very genteel presents from the last mentioned lady, and whenever her aunt spends a day with her in Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to visit Miss Sidney, and so avoid a meeting which I am sensible cannot be very desirable to any of the parties. I have not as yet seen Mr. Rooksby, but this evening his mother has a rout previous to her leaving town, and she informs me he will certainly be their. The good old lady pathetically laments her sons unfortunate attachment, says, she is certain, from good information, that he is the dupe of an artful designing woman. “She has caught him in her deep laid snare,” said she, “and he holds himself bound to her by gratitude and honour; for I am convinced real affection had little or no share in first forming the connection. He first became acquainted with her at Oxford, where she passed for the wife of an old counsellor. Her form, I am told, is very lovely, and it could not be supposed that a lad of nineteen, should repulse, or fly the advances of a beautiful accomplished woman. When he came to town she left her husband and two lovely children, and followed him, when a lodging was taking for her a few miles from London. When he went to the continent she met him at Dover, and insisted on going with him, and during their journey, the infatuated boy consented to her returning and living publicly with him in a house he has taken for the purpose.” “He has been acquainted with her some years, then,” said I. “It is above three years,” she replied, “since he first saw her.” It is really a sad thing, my dear Celia, that an abandoned woman should prey upon the fortune and destroy the peace of this young man: yet if the tears and intreaties of a fond mother cannot break the fatal charm that holds him, sure every other effort will be ineffectual. But now my friend, I must throw aside my pen, and be fine lady enough to declare it is for the purpose of dressing, I begin to wish we were in the country, I am already sick of parade, shew and farce; for really a fashionable life is nothing better. How tiresome to be plagued with the civil howdye's of fifty women, who are immensely happy to hear you are well, and would say, with the same sang froid, they were immensely sorry if they were told you were dead. Oh what a miserable figure I should make in the beau monde. 21?t. Really this Mr. Rooksby is a very tolerable being, and if I did not begin to fear he may be the cause of future vexation to me I should like to pass an hour or two in his company, now and then well enough. This morning at breakfast Mrs. Rooksby said “how happy my dear Miss Howard, should I be, if your charms and engaging qualities were to draw Clement from his unhappy engagement; I have indulged the most pleasing hopes from some expressions of admiration and surprise, which broke from him on being introduced to you last night.” “They were merely words of course, madam,” said I, smiling, “when he knew I was honoured with your approbation, he could not be so wanting in politeness as to express any dislike.” “But what will you say my dear,” she replied, “when I tell you he has absolutely engaged himself to dine with me to day, a favour he has not vouchsafed above twice since I came to town.” “We will hope, madam, he is returning to a proper sense of his duty.” “Ah! Meriel, I wish he may entertain a proper sense of your merit; how happy should I be in such a daughter; how certain would he be of happiness, if blessed with such a wife.” “Dear madam, you over power me; you over rate my merits, and indeed I feel it is impossible I should ever love any man sufficient to become his wife.” “Come,” said she, “be candid, you cannot forget Kingly.” “Indeed, madam, if I know my own heart, it never yet harboured an improper wish; I esteem both Mr. and Mrs. Kingly, but I should be extremely sorry to see any misfortune dissolve their union, but let us drop the subject, I wish to remain single; let me only enjoy your friendship my dear madam, and I shall be the happiest creature on earth.” At dinner time Mr. Rooksby arrived. I endeavoured to be unembarrassed in my manner, but after what had passed in the morning it was impossible. He was attentively polite; but I saw his dear mother watch every look, and smile approbation, whenever any thing escaped him that could be construed into tenderness. She pressed me to play and sing: some little drawings too, which she has honoured by hanging in the drawing-room, were submitted to his inspection. “They are vastly well executed,” said he. “Clara draws very prettily.” “I hope,” said his mother, “you do not make comparisons.” “Assuredly I do,” he replied hastily, “but every comparison must only convince me of Miss Howard's evident superiority, not only in every virtue, but in every accomplishment.” I hope, my dear Celia, this young man will not take it into his head to fancy himself in love with me. I never can like him; besides, I am determined never to marry. Adieu, my dear friend, I wish I was in the convent with you; but it was not my fate to pass a serene, unruffled life, and I must be as patient as I can till my hour of rest arrives. Every your's, MERIEL. END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>
