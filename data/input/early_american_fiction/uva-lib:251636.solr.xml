      <field name="fulltext">A 2 CHAPTER I. Let us retrace our steps—let us go back in our narrative, and review the feelings and the fortunes of other parties to our story, not less important to its details, and quite as dear in our regards. Let us seek the temporary dwelling of the Berkeley family, and contemplate the condition and the employment of its inmates during the progress of the severe strife of which we have given a partial history. Its terrors were not less imposing to them than they were to those who had been actors in the conflict. To the young maidens, indeed, it certainly was far more terrible than to the brave men, warmed with the provocation and reckless from the impulses of strife. And yet, how differently did the events of the day affect the two maidens—how forcibly did they bring out and illustrate their very different characters. To the casual observer there was very little change in the demeanour of Janet Berkeley. She seemed the same subdued, sad, yet enduring and uncomplaining creature, looking for affliction because she had been so often subjected to its pressure; yet, from that very cause, looking for it without apprehension, and in all the strength of religious resignation. Not so with her more volatile companion. The terrors of the fight, so near at hand, so novel in its forms, and so fearful to one who never, till now, had associated it in her thought with any other features than those of old romance—where the gorgeousness and the glitter the cheering music and the proud array, were contrived to conceal the danger, if not to salve the hurts—brought to her other and more paralyzing sensations. All her levity departed with the approach and presence of the reality, of which, hitherto, she had but dreamed, and the images of which, seen through the medium of her imagination and not her heart, had, until now, presented her with no other forms than those of loveliness or power. The first dread sounds of battle, the first crash and commotion of the conflict, taught her other feelings; and, with each reiterated shout or groan, her emotion increased to a passion of fear that became painful even to her companion—herself full of the warmest apprehensions for her lover's safety, and labouring under a true sense of the growing and gathering miseries around her. But it is at such a moment that the true nature of the mind—the true strength of the heart—the spirit, and the soul, and the affections—rise into impressive and controlling action. It was then that the majesty of a devoted woman, conscious of all the danger, yet not unprepared to meet it with him to whom her heart was given, shone forth in the bearing of Janet Berkeley. The light, thoughtless heart of Rose Duncan, untutored and unimpressed as yet by any of the vicissitudes of life, had few moods but what were hurrying and of a transient nature. She was unprepared for any but passing impressions. Her fancy had been active always, and her heart, in consequence, had grown subordinate. Affliction, the subduer—the modifier—she who checks passion in its tumults, and tempers to sedateness the warm feelings which would sometimes mount into madness—had brought her no sober counsels. Small, but accumulating cares, which benefit by their frequent warnings, had never taught her to mediate much or often upon the various sorrows, and the many changes, as frequent in the moral atmosphere as in the natural, which belong to life. That grave talebearer, 1* Time, whose legends are never wanting in their moral to those who read, had taken no heed of her education. That stern strengthener and impelling mistress, Necessity, had never, in order to bring out its resources, subjected each feeling of her heart to bondage—putting a curb upon the capricious emotion and the buoyant fancy. She heard of care from books— which seldom describe it in its true features—but it was only to regard it as a something which is to give a zest to pleasure, by sometimes changing its aspect, as in conserves we employ a slight bitter, in order to relieve pleasantly the cloying insipidity of their sweet. She had never yet seen in Sorrow the twin sister of Humanity—born with it at its birth, keeping due pace with it, though perhaps unseen, in its progress through the flowery places as well as through the tangled wilderness: clinging to it inseparably through all its fortunes—clouding at times its most pleasant sunshine with a look of reproof—chiding its sweetest anticipations with the language of homily, and pressing it downward at last to the embrace of their common mother Earth, until even Hope takes its flight, yielding the struggle for the present, and possibly withholding its assurance from the future. Thus, utterly uneducated by the heart's best tutors, the novel terrors now before her eyes left her entirely without support in reflection. She was convulsed with apprehension; the fierce oaths of the hurrying troops grated with a new form of danger upon her fancy: every wild shout smote painfully upon her senses; and the sharp shot, directed, as she now knew it to be, against the bosom of a feeling and a living man, while teaching her properly to realize the truth, totally unnerved, and left her powerless. She shrunk upon the floor in her terrors, as the dreadful din came to her ears, and crawled to the window, where her cousin sat in speechless apprehension. There, like a frightened child, she sat clinging to the drapery of Janet, while continued sobs and momentary exclamations betrayed her new consciousness of danger, and her own inadequacy of strength to contend with it. How different was the deportment of Janet. How subdued her grief—how unobtrusive her emotions—how sustained her spirit—how governing her reason. She shrunk not from the contemplation of that danger, whose terrors her mind had long since been taught to contemplate at a distance. Drawing her chair beside a little window, which looked forth directly upon the scene of battle, and scarcely in perfect security from its random shot, she gazed upon the progress of events, and exhibited, in comparison with Rose—who sat upon the floor and saw nothing—but little consciousness, and certainly no fears, of its awful terrors. Yet her emotions were not less active, her feelings not less susceptible and warm, than those of her companion. It was, indeed, because her consciousness was so deep, her love so abiding, her fears so thick and overflowing, that she had no audible emotions. The waters of her heart were too far down for display; it is only in the shallows that the breakers leap up, and chafe, and murmur. They speak not for themselves, but for the overfull and heaving ocean that gathers, and settles, gloomily and great, in the distance. The clamour of her cousin's fear had spoken for hers; and yet how full of voice, how touching the language of silence, when we know that the full heart is running over. How thrilling is the brief, gasping, sudden exclamation, which utters all, because we feel that it has uttered nothing. She sat with her hands clasped—her soul sad and sick, but strong—her eyes intently gazing, as if they would burst from their sockets, upon the wild scene of confusion going on around her. And when the strife began warmly in the first stage, and before the house was fired—when she knew nothing of the progress of events, and heard nothing but the sharp and frequent shot, without knowing what had been its effect,—when the shriek of agony reached her ears faintly from afar, and there came no word to her to say that the wounded victim was not the one of all in that controversy to whom her thought and her prayer were most entirely given; it was then that she felt the agony which yet she did not speak. In her mind she strove to think a prayer for his success and for his safety, and sometimes the words of aspiration were muttered brokenly from her lips; but the prayer died away in her heart, and the dreadful incidents of earth, going on around her, kept back her thoughts from God. A terrible cry of satisfaction was uttered by the partisans as, in the conflict, they beheld one of the defenders of the house distinctly fall back from the window at which he had exposed himself. The rifle had been too quick and fatal for his escape. The sound smote upon the senses of Janet with a new fear; and Rose, in her childish terror, nearly dragged her from the seat. “Father of mercies, spare him—spare them all! Soften their hearts—let them not spill blood!” was the involuntary prayer of Janet. “Rose, do not go on so; do not fear; you are not in danger, dear Rose; but keep on the floor, the shot cannot reach you there.” “But you, Janet, you are in danger at the window; come down, dear Janet, and sit with me. The bullets will be sure to hit you. Come down. I'm so afraid.” “Pull me not down, Rose; there is no danger here, for the shot do not fly in this direction. They fly all towards the garden, where our people are, under the trees.” “Where? do you see them, Janet?” cried Rose, half rising. “Yes; bush—there!” but a cry and a shot at that moment frightened the other to her place upon the floor, and she sank down with renewed trepidation. “I see them now—all of them; some stand behind the water-oaks: and I see two crawling along under the bushes. God preserve them! Should Barsfield know they are there, he could kill them, for there are no trees between them and the house: nothing but the bushes. Oh! God—” The exclamation startled Rose with a new terror. “What, Janet?” “I see him! Rash Mellichampe! I see him, and he is mounted. The tories must see him too. Why! oh, why will he expose himself! why does he not keep behind the trees! He stands—he does not move! Barsfield must soon see him now. Fly, fly, Earnest!” and her emotion assuming the ascendency, she arose from her chair, and motioned with her hand, and cried with her voice, now feeble and husky from affright, as if he, to whom it was addressed, could hear it at such a distance. “He hears me—he moves away! Oh, dear Ernest! he is now behind the trees. Thank God, he is safe!” and she sank again into her seat, and fondly believed, at that moment, that he had heard her warnings and complied with her entreaties. There was a pause in the conflict. Neither shot nor shout came to their senses. “Is it over, Janet?” cried Rose. “Have they done fighting? I hear nothing. There is no danger now.” “Would it were over, Rose; but I fear it is not. I see the men watching behind the trees. Some are riding away, and some are creeping still around the fence. It blinds me to look; it maddens me to think, Rose that he is there, exposed to the murderous aim of those merciless tories, in the danger which I may not keep him from, which I do not share with him. Pray, Rose, pray, dearest, for the safety of our men. Pray, for I cannot. I can only look.” “Nor I. But how can you look? the very thought of it is too horrible.” “The thought of it to me is more dreadful than the A 3 sight,” was the answer of Janet. “Months have gone by, Rose, since I first began to think of battle and of Mellichampe's hourly danger; and when I thought of it then, it was far more terrible than now, when I look upon it before me. But oh! dearest Rose, how awful is that silence. There is no shouting—there are no cries of blood and death, and yet they are planning death. They are meditating how best to succeed in slaughtering their fellow-creatures.” “Do you see them now, Janet?” “Yes; there, behind the trees. Look now, Rose There is now no danger, I think.” The more timid girl rose to survey the distant array which she did with all the eager curiosity of childhood. The bugle sounded. “Ah, Rose! they are in council. See them under the great oak yonder, to the left—there, close by the stunted cedar?” “I see, I see! How their swords glitter, Janet How beautiful; how strange! And that trumpet, how shrilly sweet, how strong and wild its notes, seeming like the cry of some mighty bird as it rushes through the storm. Oh, Janet, what a beautiful thing is war.” “So is death, sometimes. Beautiful, but terrible. Alas! that man should seek to make crime lovely! Alas! that woman should so admire power and courage as to forget the cruelties in their frequent employ. God keep us! they are going to fight again.” With a scream Rose sank again to the floor, grasping the dress of her companion, and clinging to it with all the trepidation of childhood. “Ah! they lift their rifles. I see three of them that kneel behind the trees, and they have their aim upon something, but what I cannot see. What is it they would shoot? They are pointed to the house, too. I see now: two of the tories are at one window. God help them, why do they not hide themselves?” “Are they gone now, Janet?” asked Rose, in the momentary silence of her companion. “I know not; I cannot look again. Ha! the shot! the shot!—the rifles!—they are slain!” The sharp sudden sound of the rifles followed almost instantly the inquiry of Rose Duncan, and the eyes of Janet instantly turned, as under some fascination, towards the window. The troopers were no longer to be seen. Shuddering as with convulsion, she turned from the window and sank down beside her more timid companion. But her heart was too full of anxiety to suffer her to remain long where she had fallen. The sounds again ceased, and she ventured to rise once more and look forth upon the prospect. She now saw the scene more distinctly. The partisans had somewhat changed their position, and were now nearer the cottage. Singleton stood beneath a tree, with several of his officers about him. The quick eye of Janet readily distinguished her lover among them. He stood erect, graceful and firm as ever, and she forgot her fears —her sorrows. He was unhurt. While she looked they moved away from the spot, and she now beheld them making a circuit round the park so as to avoid unnecessary exposure to the tory bullets, and approaching the little cottage in which the family found shelter. “Heavens! Rose, they are coming here—the officers. What can they want? There may be some one hurt. Yet no, it does not look so.” “Then the fighting is over, Janet.” “No, no, I fear not, for I see the riflemen all around the house, and watching it closely from beneath the trees. But here they come, the officers, and he is among them. Go, Rose, dearest, and send my father to meet them. I cannot. I will rather sit here and wait until they are gone.” The partisans sought the house the better to carry on their deliberations. They obtained some refreshments from Mr. Berkeley, and then proceeded to confer on the subject of the leaguer. We have seen the result of their deliberations, in the gift which Janet had made to her lover of the bow and arrows. It will not need that we dwell longer upon the event. Let us proceed to others, in which she also had a share.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Throughout the conflict, a close and deeply interested observer, Janet Berkeley had never once departed from her post of watch. She had felt all the sickness—the dreadful sickness—of suspense. She suffered all the terrors of one anxious in the last degree about the result of the battle, yet perfectly conscious of its thousand uncertainties. The wild and various cries of the warriors,—now of triumph and now of defeat, or physical agony,—went chillingly to her heart; yet, the sentinel of love, jealous of her watch, and solicitous of the safety of that over which it was held, she kept her place, in spite of all the solicitations of Rose and of her equally apprehensive father. She did not seem conscious of her own danger while she continued to think of that of Mellichampe; and, so long as the battle lasted, could she think of any thing else? She did not. We have seen the patriotic resolution with which she devoted the family mansion to destruction. She had beheld the application of the torch,—she had seen the arrow winged with flame smiting the sacred roof which had sheltered so many generations, and with that glorious spirit which so elevated the maidens of Carolina during the long struggle of the revolution—making them rather objects of national than of social contemplation,—she had felt a triumphant glow of self-gratulation that it had been with her to contribute to a cause doubly sacred, as it involved the life of her country not less than that of her lover. With hands clasped and tearful eyes, she had prayed as fervently for the conflagration of the dwelling as, at another time and other more favourable auspices, she would have prayed and laboured for its preservation and safety. With an intensity of feeling not surpassed by that of any one of the brave men commingling in the strife, she had beheld the progress of the flame. How her heart beat when, more remote from the smoky cloud which hung all around the dwelling, she had seen, sooner than the partisans, the impetuous rush—mounted all, and with blazing weapons—of Barsfield and his party! But when she heard the clash of sabres in front of the dwelling, and in the narrow avenue which led to it,—when she listened to the sounds of that conflict which she could no longer see,—it was then that her spirit sickened most. Imagination—the feverish fancy—grew active and impatient. Crowding fears came gathering about her heart, which grew cold under their influence. Her head swam dizzily, until at length, in utter exhaustion, she sank from the seat at the window, and strove feebly, on bended knees, by the side of the trembling Rose, once more to pray. But she could not: the words refused to come to her lips; the thoughts of her mind were too wild, too foreign, and not to be coerced; they were in the field of battle—striving in its strife—in the cruel strife of man with man. How could she bring her mind, thus employed, and at such a moment, with all its horrid and unholy associations of crime and terror, even for the purposes of supplication, into the presence of her God? She dared not. She started from her knees as she heard the tread of hurrying feet around the dwelling. She reached the window in time to see that four of the partisans were 2 employed in bearing one in their arms, who seemed dead or fatally wounded. They laid him down under the shelter of some trees behind the house, and the moment after she saw them hurrying back to the avenue. She tried to call to them,—she sought to know who was the wounded man; but the words died away in inarticulate sounds. She could not speak; and, in an instant, they were out of sight. Her agony became insupportable. Who was the victim? Her fears—her imagination, answered. She watched her time, during the momentary inattention of her father, and, without declaring her intention to Rose, she stole out of the apartment. She hurried from the house unseen. She reached the tree under which the dead body had been laid. It was covered with a cloak, which was stained with blood, apparently still flowing from the bosom of the wounded man. She dared not lift the garment. Her hand was extended, but trembled feebly above it. But she heard approaching voices, and was nerved for the occasion. She hastily threw the cloak from the face, and once more she breathed freely: the features were unknown—happily unknown. There was none to feel the loss while bending over him; and she rejoiced, with a sad pleasure, that the loss was not hers. She hurried back with a new life to the apartment, and had scarcely reached it when she heard the sound of a trumpet borne upon the winds from a direction opposite, and beyond, that in which the combatants had been engaged. A new enemy was at hand. The shrill and inspiriting notes approached rapidly, swelling more and more loudly until the avenue was gained, and then there was a pause—a dreadful silence—among those who had lately been so fearfully at strife. In a few moments after, and she saw Major Singleton rush towards her, followed by several of his men. She heard his orders distinctly, and they brought a new terror to her soul. “Forward, John Davis, with a dozen rifles, and bring off Mellichampe: that bugle is Tarleton's, and the whole of the mounted men of the legion are upon him. Give the advance a close fire, and that will relieve him; then fall back behind those bays—reload, and renew your fire. That done, take to the branch, and stand prepared to mount. Away!” They obeyed him promptly, stole up behind the copse, and received the advance of Tarleton with a fire as of one man. We have seen the result: the enemy leaped the ditch, broke through the copse, and found no foe. But the purposed relief of Mellichampe came too late to bring off the brave youth for whose succour it had been intended. The personal effort of Witherspoon had failed also. That faithful attendant had barely crossed the ditch when the riflemen came forward. Having no rifle, he could not contribute to their strength; and, with a word, pointing out to them a proper cover, he hurried forwards with all despatch to the place of rendezvous. But, though he strove to avoid being seen by any of the household while passing, as he was compelled to do, the little cottage in which the Berkeley family were collected, he could not escape the quick, apprehensive eye of Janet. She saw him approaching,—she saw that he was seeking safety in flight,—and, what was of more appalling concern to her, knowing his attachment to Mellichampe, she saw that he fled alone. How quick, how far darting, is the eye of apprehension! She could read the expression of his countenance as he approached, even as a book. She saw the question answered in his face which her lips had yet not asked. How slowly did he approach: she rose,—her hand was lifted and waved to him; but, when he looked towards her, he increased his speed. She cried aloud to him in her desperation:— “Come to me, John Witherspoon—come to me, if you have pity—but for one moment!” Did he hear her? He did not answer; but, as if he guessed her meaning from her action, he flung up his arms in air, as if to say, “Despair, despair!—all's lost!”—for so her heart interpreted his action—and in another instant he was out of sight. The riflemen followed soon behind him, stealing from cover to cover in the neighbouring foliage, and had scarcely been hidden from her gaze before the fierce troopers of Tarleton came bounding after them. Vainly did her eyes strain in the examination of the forms of those who fled: she saw not the one of all,—he whom alone she sought for; and the fear of his fate grew into absolute certainty when the blue uniforms of the terrible legion came out on every hand before her. She saw them hurrying fast and far after the flying partisans, and every blast of the trumpet, as it died away in the distance, brought a new pang into her mind, until the agony became insupportable. She determined to suffer no longer under the gnawing suspense which clamoured at her heart. “I will know the worst: I cannot bear this agony, and live!” Thus murmuring, she started from her place by the window, and turned to the feeble Rose, who still lay upon the floor at her feet, in a degree of mental and physical prostration full as great, even now, as at the first moment in which the battle joined. “Rose—dear Rose, will you go with me?” “Where—go where, Janet? You frighten me!” “There is no danger now. Go with me, Rose— dear cousin—let me not go alone.” “But tell me where, dearest Janet? Where would you go?—and you look so strange and wild,—put up your hair, Janet.” “No—no—no matter. It is no time. I must go,— I must seek him, Rose, and I would not go alone. Come with me, dearest—my sister—come with me. Believe me, there can be no danger,—only to the avenue.” “What, where they've been fighting, and in all that horrid blood?” cried the other, in a voice that was a shriek. “Even there—where there is blood,—where—oh, God, be with me!—where there must be death. I go to seek for it, Rose, though I would not find it if I could,” solemnly, and with clasped and uplifted hands, responded the devoted maiden. “Never—never,” cried the other. “Rose—dear Rose, will you let me go alone? I beg you, Rose—on my knees—there is no danger now.” “There is danger, Janet, and they will murder us. I heard them crying and shouting only a minute ago; and, there—there is that dreadful trumpet now, whose sounds go like a sword-stab to my heart. I cannot, Janet—I dare not: there is danger.” “None: on my life, Rose, there is no danger now. Our people have retreated, and the dragoons have all gone off in pursuit. They are now a great way off, and we can get back to the house long before they return. Do not fear, Rose, but go with me, only for a little while.” “I cannot, I will not go among the dead bodies. You would not have me go there, Janet,—you surely will not go yourself?” “Ay, there, Rose—even there, among the dying and the dead, if it must be so. I may serve the one,—I have no cause to fear the other. It may be—it must be—dreadful to look upon, but my heart holds it to be a duty that I should go there now, and, if not a duty, it is a desire that I cannot control. I must go, Rose, and I would not go alone.” “I will not; forgive me, Janet, but I should go mad to see the blood and the dead bodies. I cannot go.” “God be with me!—I must go alone:” and, as she replied thus, giving her solemn determination, her eyes 2* were uplifted in a holy appeal to the Almighty Being, whose presence, in the absence of all others, she had invoked for her adventure. “Hold me not, Rose—I am resolved. I must go, though I go alone. Yet, I should not, Rose, if you would but reflect. There are no noises now—there are no alarms: the troops have gone—there is no sort of danger.” She looked appealingly to her companion while she spoke, but her eye met no answering sympathies in that of Rose Duncan. The terrors of the latter were unabated. There was a vital difference of character between the two. The elastic spirit of the more lively maiden was one merely of the physical and external world. She was the summer-bird—a thing of glitter and of sunshine. She could not live in the stormy weather—she could not bide the turbulence of strife. It was at such a time that the spirit of Janet Berkeley came forth in strength, if not in buoyance; even as the eagle, who takes that season to soar forth from his mountain dwelling, when the black masses of the tempest growl and gather most gloomily around it. “You will not, Rose?” “No,—do not ask me, Janet.” The firm and determined maiden, without another word, simply raised her finger, and pointed to the adjoining apartment, where her father was. The uplifted finger then pressed her lips for a moment, and in the next she was gone from sight. Rose did not believe that she would go forth after her refusal to accompany her, and she now earnestly called her back. But she was already out of hearing: she had gone forth to the field of blood and battle; and, strong in love, and fearless in absorbing and concentrative affections, she had gone alone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Love is the vital principle of religion—it is religion. It is the devotion that fears not death—which is not won by life—which cannot be seduced from duty—which is patient and uncomplaining amid privation. Its existence becomes merged in that of the object which it worships, and its first gift is the sacrifice of—self. There is no love if the heart will not make this sacrifice, and the heart never truly loves until this sacrifice be made. Self is that life which we surrender when we gain the happiness of the blessed. Seldom made in this life, it is yet the only condition upon which we are secure of the future. Ah! happy the spirit which is soonest ready for the sacrifice. To such a spirit, Heaven and Immortality are one! The destiny of such a creature as Janet Berkeley might even now be written. She is secure. There can be no change in such a character. Time, and fortune, sickness, the defeat of hope, and the consciousness of approaching death, could never alter one lofty mood, one self-devoting impulse of her soul. Surely, though she seeks the field of terror unaccompanied by human form, she will not necessarily be alone. The God whose worship calls only for love, will not be heedless of the safety of her who toils for the beloved one. He is with her. Resolute as she was to seek the field of strife, and fearless as her conduct approved her spirit, she was yet sufficiently maiden in her reserve, to desire, as much as possible, to conceal from stranger eyes the object of her adventure. With a cautious footstep, therefore, she stole from cover to cover, until she reached the artificial bank, clustering and crowded with shrubs and vines, which supported the trees on one side of the spacious avenue. With a trembling hand she parted the shrubbery before her, and her eyes took in for an instant the field of battle, and then, immediately after, shutting out its objects, closed, as if with a moral comprehension of their own. She could not be mistaken in the dreadful objects in her sight. The awful testimonies of the desperate fight were strewn around her. Her uplifted foot, in the very first step which she had been about to take from the bank, hung suspended over the lifeless body of one of its victims. She turned suddenly and sickeningly away. She strove, but she could not pass into the avenue at that point, and she receded through the thicket, and made her way round to another quarter, in which she hoped to find an unobstructed passage. There was but little time for delay, and with this thought a new resolution brought strength to her frame. Again her hand parted the copse, making a passage for her person. This time she dared not look. She did not again permit herself either to think or look, but resolutely leaping across the ditch, she stood for a moment, awed and trembling, but still firm, in the presence of the dead. She was motionless for several seconds, but her mind neutralized, in its noble strength of purpose, the otherwise truly feminine feebleness of her person. She was about to move forward in her determined task; but, when she strove to lift her foot, it seemed half fastened to the ground. She looked down, and her shoe was covered with clotted blood. She stood in a fast freezing puddle of what, but an hour before, had been warm life and feeling. But she did not now give heed to the obstruction —she was unconscious of this thought. Her mind was elsewhere, and her eyes sought for another object. The anxiety of her heart was too intense to make her heedful of those minor influences, which, at another time, would have shocked the sensibilities and overthrown all the strength of her sex. She hurried forward, and her eyes were busy all around her. The whole length of the avenue seemed marked by the suffering victims, or those who had ceased to suffer. Death had been busy in this quarter, and tory and rebel had equally paid tribute to the destroyer. A deep moaning, feebly uttered, but full of pain, came to her ears. It guided her steps. She followed the one sound only. A wounded man lay half in the ditch, to which he had crawled as if to be out of the way of the horses. His head and shoulders were on the bank—the rest of his body was concealed. A frightful gash disfigured his face, and the blood-smeared features were yet pale with the sickness of death. He stretched out a feeble arm as she approached. He muttered a single word— “Water.” At another time, she would have run with the speed of charity to bring him the blessed draught for which he prayed, but now she gave him no heed. There was nothing in his face which spoke to her heart, and that moaning sound yet reached her ears at intervals. She hurried onward, and the pleading wretch sank back and perished, even as he prayed. She heard his last gasping groan, but it had no effect upon her feeling. Her mind was sensible only of the one sound which had so far guided her footsteps. It seemed, through the medium of some strange instinct, at once to convey itself to her soul. She reached the bend in the avenue from whence it came. On the edge of the ditch, half buried in the water and the long grass, lay the wounded man. A single glance informed her. She could not mistake the uniform. “Mellichampe,” she cried, in a thrilling voice of terror, as, with one desperate bound, she rushed forward to the spot, and, heedless of the thick blood which had died the grass all around where he lay, sank on her knees beside him, while her infolding arms were wrapped about his bosom. “Ernest—dear Ernest!—speak to me—tell me that you live—say that you are mine still—that I do not lose you. Look at me, Ernest—speak to me—speak to me only once.” He was in her arms—he breathed—he felt—but he spoke not, and did not seem conscious. Her heart was strong, though suffering; and her feeble strength of person, under its promptings, was employed with an energy of which she had never before conjectured one half the possession, to drag him forth from the vines and brambles which lay thick around his face—the concealing cover in which he had been studiously placed by the trusty Witherspoon the moment before his own flight. From this cover she now strove to lift the form of her lover, and, though wounding her delicate fingers at every effort with the thorns, the devoted Janet felt nothing of their injuries as she laboured with this object. With great effort she succeeded in drawing him upon the bank, and his head now rested upon her arms. A writhing of his person—a choking, half-suppressed groan, attested the returning consciousness with the increased pain following this movement, and mixed moans and menaces fell incoherently from his lips. Even these signs, though signs of pain to him, and holding forth no encouragement or hope to her, were yet more grateful than the unconsciousness in which he lay before. She spoke to him—the words bursting forth in an intensity of natural eloquence from her tongue, which could scarce have failed to arouse him, even from the stupor of overcoming death itself. “Speak to me, Mellichampe—dear Ernest, speak to me Tell me that you live—that you are not hurt to death. It is Janet—your own Janet that calls upon you. Look up and see—look up and hear me—it is my arms, dear Ernest, that hold you now—the bloody men are all gone.” And his dim eyes did unclose, and they did look up with a sweet mournfulness of expression, vacant and wild, that grew into a smile, almost of pleasure, when they met the earnest, commiserating glance of hers. They closed again almost instantly, however, but he murmured her name at the moment. “Janet—you?” “Your own—in life and death, Ernest—ever your own.” And she clung to him with a tenacious hold at that instant, as if determined that death should take no separate victim. He was again conscious, and spoke, though feebly: “I fear me it is death, Janet. I feel it—this pain cannot long be endured, and my limbs are useless.” “Speak not thus, Ernest—I know it is not so. Stay —move not. I will lift you to the house—I will—” “You!” and he smiled feebly and fondly, as he arrested the idle speech. “God of Heaven! have mercy!—what shall I do?— I may not help him,” and the exclamation burst spontaneously from her lips, as she found, after repeated efforts, that her feeble arms were inadequate to the task even of lifting him from his present painful position to a drier spot upon the bank. In her bewilderment and anguish, she could only call his name in a bitter fondness. He heard her complaints, and seemed to comprehend their occasion. His lips parted, and, though with pain and a sensible effort, he strove to speak to her. The words were faint and inaudible. She bent down her ears, and at length distinguished what he said. He but named to her the faithful negro who had once before stood so opportunely between him and his enemy, and had nearly suffered a dreadful and ignominious death in consequence of his fidelity. “Scip—Scipio—he will come—Scip.” His eyes closed with the effort, but her face brightened as she listened to the words. She immediately laid his head tenderly upon the bank, pressed the pale unconscious forehead with her lips, and, bounding away through the thicket, hurried with all the fleetness of a zealous and devoted spirit to the completion of her task.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. She was not long in finding the faithful Scipio. He sprang with all the alacrity of a genuine zeal in obedience to her commands. When he heard from her faltering lips the melancholy occasion which called for his attendance, his own emotion was unrestrainable, though he affected to doubt the certainty of her information. “Who—who da hurt, misses? You no say da Mass Arnest? I no blieb it. Mass Arnest, he too strong, and he too quick for let dem dam tory hurt a bone in he body. He somebody else, misses. You no 'casion for scare; he somebody else hab knock on he head— no Mass Arnest, I berry sartin. But I go long wid you all de same, dough I no guine tink da Mass Arnest git hurt. He hab much hurt, I turn soger myself. I run 'way from old mossa, and take de bush after dem tory. I sway to God nothing guine 'top me I once in de woods. But, come, young misses, show me de place whay the person hurt, dough I know berry well 'taint Mass Arnest.” Denying her assertion, yet fearing at every step that he took—and, indeed, only denying that he might the more readily impose upon himself with the unbelief which he expressed, but with which he was yet not satisfied—the sturdy Scipio followed his young mistress towards the avenue. They had not reached the little copse, however, by which it was girdled, before they heard the rush of horses, and the shrill blast of the bugle. “'Top in dis bush, young misses—squat down here under dis percimmon, whay day can't see you.” “No, Scipio, let us go forward. I think we can get to the avenue before they come up, and I would have you lift him into the bushes out of the way of the horsemen, before they have passed by. Do not fear, Scipio; we shall have time—but you must go forward quickly.” The black looked into her face with astonishment, as well he might. Her words were unbroken, and her tones quick and unaffected, equable, even musical, while his own, accustomed as he had been all his life to utter and complete subordination, were tremulous with timidity and fear. “Gor-a-mighty, Miss Janet, you no scare? You no frightened, and you only young gal? Scip member you when you been only so high, and here you tall—you 'tan' up traight—you look all round—you no trouble, dough you hear de horn blow and de sogers coming. Wha' for you no scare like Scipio?” She could not smile at that moment, as at another she could scarcely have refrained from doing; but her eye was turned upon the half-unnerved negro, and her taper finger rested on his sable wrist, as she said, in tones which strengthened him, as he felt they came from one who was herself supernaturally strengthened, “Fear nothing, but come on quickly. I need all your strength, Scipio; and, if you will mind what I say to you, there will be no danger. Come on.” He opposed nothing farther to her progress, but followed in silence. They had reached an outer fence, the rails of which had been let down in order to the free passage of the cavalry before, when the increasing clamour of the approaching detachment under Barsfield again impelled Scipio to other suggestions of caution to his Vol. II.—B 3 youthful mistress. But she heeded him not, and continued her progress. Nor did he shrink. He could perish for her as readily as for Mellichampe; and, to do the faithful slave all justice, his exhortations were prompted not so much by his own danger or hers, as by a natural sense of the delicacy of that position in which she might involve herself, under that strong and passionate fervour of devoted love, which blinded her to all feeling of danger, and placed her infinitely beyond the fear of death. Other fears she had not. Her maiden innocence had never yet dreamed of a wrong to that purity of soul and person, of which her whole life might well have been considered the imbodied representative. But the forbearance of the negro, and his ready compliance hitherto, all disappeared when, on reaching the copse, he beheld the bright sabres flashing in his eyes immediately in the courtyard, as, rounding the yet blazing fabric, the troopers of Barsfield were even then making with all speed towards the avenue. He caught the wrist of his mistress, and pointed out the advancing enemy. She saw at a glance that, in another moment, they would make their appearance in the avenue quite as soon as herself. But a few paces divided her from Mellichampe; and, as she hesitated whether to pause or proceed, she trembled now, for the first time in her movement. In that moment of doubt, the more ready physical energy of the negro obtained the ascendency. With something like fear he drew her to a part of the copse which was thicker than the rest, and here she partially crouched from sight, he taking a place humbly enough immediately behind her. What were her feelings then, in that position—what her fears! She bore them not long. The anxiety and the suspense were infinitely beyond all estimation of the danger in her mind; and, with fearless hands, after a few moments of dreadful pause and apprehension, she divided the crowding bushes from before her, and looked down into the ditch which separated her from the avenue. At that moment, leading his squad and moving rapidly at their head, Barsfield rode into the enclosure. Instinctively, as she beheld his huge form and fiercely-excited, harsh features, her hands sunk down at her side, and the slender branches which she had opened in the copse before her, with their crowding foliage, resumed in part their old position, and would most completely have concealed her; but when, in the next instant, she beheld the fierce tory ride directly to the spot where Mellichampe lay—when she saw him rein up his steed and leap with onward haste to the ground—when her eye scanned the intense malignity and mingled exultation and hatred of his glance, and she saw that his bloody sabre was even then uplifted—she had no farther fears—she had no farther thoughts of herself. She tore the branches away from before her, and, in defiance of all the efforts of the faithful Scipio to restrain her, she leaped forward directly into the path of the tory, and in the face of his uplifted weapon. Her appearance was in the last degree opportune. Another moment might have ended all her cares for her lover. Barsfield was standing above him, and Mellichampe had exhibited just life enough to give the tory an excuse sufficient to drive the sword which he held into the bosom of that enemy whom, of all the world, he was most desirous to destroy. The meditated blow was almost descending, and the feeble youth, stimulated by the presence of his foe, was vainly struggling to rise from the earth, which was all discoloured with his blood. His dim eyes were opening in momentary flashes, while his sinewless arm was feebly striving to lift the sabre, which he had still retained tenaciously in his grasp, in opposition to that of Barsfield. The instinct rather than the reason of love prevailed. Indeed, the instinct of love is woman's best reason. With a shriek that rose more shrilly upon the air than the bugle of the enemy, she threw herself under the B 2 weapon—she lay prostrate upon the extended and fainting form of her lover—she clasped his head with her arms, and her bosom formed the sweet and all-powerful barrier which, in that perilous moment, protected his. The weapon of the tory was arrested. He had heard her cry—he had seen the movement—and he did not, he could not then, strike. “Save him, spare him, Barsfield!—he is dying,—you have already slain him! Strike no other blow; have mercy, I pray you,—if not upon him, have mercy upon me. I have never wronged you—I will not,—let us go free. Why will you hate us so—why—why?” “Fear not, Miss Berkeley—you mistake my purpose: I mean not to destroy him. Leave him now,— let one of my men attend you to the house; and Mr. Mellichampe shall be taken care of.” “I will not leave him,” she exclaimed; “I dare not trust you, Barsfield,—I can take care of him myself.” The fierce brow of the tory blackened as this reproachful speech met his ears. “What! not trust me, Miss Berkeley?” “Why should I? Did I not behold you, even now, about to strike his unguarded bosom?” “He strove to fight—he offered resistance,” was the somewhat hasty reply of the tory. “He strove to fight!—he offered resistance!—oh, shame, Captain Barsfield—shame to manhood—that you should speak such language! What resistance could he offer?—how could he fight, and the blood that could only have given him strength for such a conflict soaking up the earth about him? If that blood were now in his heart, Mr. Barsfield, you would not now speak thus, nor would I have occasion, sir, to plead for his life at any hands, and, least of all, at yours.” She had raised herself from the body, over which she still continued to bend, under the indignation of her spirit at the unmanly speech of the tory. Her eyes flashed forth a fire as she spoke, 'neath which his own grew humbled and ashamed. His muscles quivered with rage and vexation, and his only resort for relief was to that natural suggestion of the lowly mind which seeks to conceal or fortify one base action by the commission of another. “Take her away, Beacham,” he said to one of the troopers; “carry her to the house—tenderly, Beacham—tenderly; hurt her not. Be careful, as you value my favour.” “Touch me not,” she cried aloud, “touch me not: put no hand upon me. This is my home, Captain Barsfield,—I am here of right, while you are but the guest of our hospitality. Do not suffer these men to lay hands upon me.” “But you are here in danger, Miss Berkeley.” “Only from you, sir—only from you and yours. I am in no danger, sir, from him—none—none. I will cling to him for safety to the last, though he hear me not—though he never hear me again. He is mine, sir, and I am his; but you knew this before. He is mine, —you shall not tear me from my husband.” “Husband!” cried Barsfield, in unmitigated surprise and unconcealed vexation. “Yes, husband, before God, if not in the eye of man! Living or dead, Ernest, I am still yours—yours only. I swear it by this unconscious form,—I swear it by all that is good and holy—all that can hallow an innocent love, and make sacred and strong so solemn and so dear a pledge! You cannot now separate us,—you dare not!” “You know not, Miss Berkeley, how much I can dare in the performance of my duty.” “This is no duty of yours,—I need none of your guardianship.” “Ay, Miss Berkeley, you do not, perhaps, but he does. He is my prisoner, under charge of a heavy 3* crime—of treason to his sovereign, and of being a spy upon my camp.” “What! he—Mellichampe! Oh, false, false—foolish and false!” was her almost fierce exclamation. “True as gospel, Miss Berkeley, as I shall prove to his conviction, if not yours. But this is trifling, surely. Beacham, remove the lady; treat her tenderly, but remove her from the body of the prisoner: we must secure him at all hazards—living or dead.” The rugged soldier, in obedience to these commands, approached the maiden, who now clung more firmly than ever to the half-conscious form of her lover. Her arms were wound about his neck, and, with convulsive shrieks at intervals, she spoke alternately to Barsfield and her lover. In the meantime, beholding the approach of the soldier who had been instructed to bear her away, the faithful Scipio, though entirely unarmed, did not hesitate at once to leap forward to her assistance. He made his way between her and the soldier Beacham, and, though his arms hung without movement at his side, there was yet enough in his manner to show to the tory that he meditated all the resistance of which, under the circumstances, he could be considered capable. His teeth were set firmly; his eyes sought those of the soldier, and were there fixed; and his head rested upon one shoulder with an air of dogged determination which, even before he spoke, conveyed all the eloquence of his subsequent words. “Say de wud, misses—only say de wud, and I hammer dis poor buckrah till he hab noting leff but de white ob he eye. He hab sword for stick, and Scip only hab he hand and teet'; but I no 'fraid ob um; only you say de wud—dat's all!” But poor Scipio, as was natural enough at such a moment, in the presence of his mistress, and his blood mounting high at seeing the condition of Ernest Mellichampe, had grievously miscalculated his own strength. He had scarcely spoken when a stroke from the back of a sabre across the head brought him to the ground, like a stunned ox, and taught Janet how little commiseration she was to expect from the fierce man who stood before her, wielding at that instant her entire destiny. The soldier advanced, though with some evident reluctance, and he laid his hand upon her. She started, on the instant, and rose immediately to her feet. “If you are resolved upon violence towards me, Captain Barsfield, I will spare myself, as much as possible, the pain of suffering it. You have, sir, all the shame of having commanded it. I know that you have the strength to tear me away from him; you are wise, perhaps, as you seem only to employ it when the difference is so manifest. But I will not be separated from him, though you declare him your prisoner: I will be a prisoner also; I will cling to him wherever you may decree that he shall be carried; for know, sir, that I trust you not. The man who will employ violence to a woman would murder his sleeping enemy!” “Remove her to the house, Beacham,” was all that the tory said; but his words were uttered with teeth closely clinched together, and his whole frame seemed to quiver with indignation. At that moment the sound of Tarleton's returning bugle smote suddenly upon the ears of all; and the quick sense of Janet immediately saw, in the features of Barsfield, that the intelligence was not pleasing to his mind. He hurried his commands for the removal of Mellichampe's body, and was now doubly anxious to convey her to the house. Without a definite motive for refusing now to do that to which, but a moment before, she had consented, she sprang again to the person of her lover, again threw her arms about him, and refused to be separated. While thus situated, the tones of another voice were heard immediately behind the group. The deep, subdued, but stern accents of Tarleton himself were not to be mistaken; and Barsfield started in obvious agitation, as he heard the question which first announced to him the presence of his superior.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The group, at that moment in the avenue, formed a striking picture. The voice of Tarleton seemed to have the effect of paralyzing and fixing to his place each of the parties. Janet, on bended knee, with her person half stretched over the insensible body of her lover, her face turned and her hand uplifted to the legionary colonel, looked, at the same moment, relieved and apprehensive. She felt that the presence of Tarleton was a restraint upon the vindictive personal hostility of Barsfield; but did she not also know that the name of the legionary was synonymous in Carolina with every thing that was bloody and revengeful? She hoped and trembled, yet she was better pleased that the destinies of her lover should rest with the latter than the former. Tarleton could have no individual hatred to Mellichampe;— she well conceived the viperous and unforgiving hate which rankled against him in the bosom of the tory. The quiet inquiry—the even and subdued tones, of Tarleton, had the effect of a like paralysis upon the limbs of Barsfield. His mood was rebuked—his violent proceedings at once arrested, as he heard them: yet they were words of simple inquiry. “What does all this mean, Captain Barsfield?—why is this lady here?” The tory explained, or sought to explain, but he performed the task imperfectly. “A wounded enemy—a prisoner, sir. I would have conveyed him where he could procure tendance, but Miss Berkeley resisted.” The maiden rose. She approached Tarleton, and said to him, in low, but still audible tones, “Because I would not trust him. He would have killed him—he would have murdered him with his bloody sword, if I had not come between.” “But who is he, young lady—what is the youth in whom you take such interest?” Her lips quivered, and a faint flush spread itself over her cheeks, but she did not reply. “Who is the prisoner, Captain Barsfield?” “A rebel, sir—one Mellichampe.” “Son of Max Mellichampe?” demanded Tarleton, interrupting him. “The same, sir; as malignant a rebel as his father; and one not only liable to be dealt with as such, but one whom I would secure for trial as a spy.” At these words she spoke. The accusation against her lover aroused her. Her eye flashed indignant fires upon the tory as she spoke fearlessly in reply. “It is false, sir—a wilful falsehood, believe me. Ernest Mellichampe was no spy; he could not be. This man conceives his enemy's character from his own. Mellichampe is incapable, sir, of so base an employment; and Captain Barsfield knows him sufficiently well to know it. Ernest did but come to the house to see us, as he was accustomed to come; and it so happened that Captain Barsfield, with his troop, came that very day also. My father always extended to Ernest Mellichampe the same hospitality which he extended to Captain Barsfield; and so, sir, you see that Ernest was our visiter, our guest, like Captain Barsfield, and one of them could no more be a spy than the other. Captain Barsfield knows all this; and, if he did not hate Ernest, I should not have to tell it you. But I tell you the truth, sir, as I am a woman: Ernest was no spy, and the charge against him is false and sinful.” B 3 She paused, breathless and agitated. Tarleton smiled faintly as he heard her through, and his eyes rested with a gentle and most unwonted expression upon the glowing face of the fair pleader. Her eye shrunk from, while her whole frame trembled beneath, his gaze. “But why is he here, my good young lady—why, if he is our friend—why is he here?” inquired Tarleton, in the gentlest language. “I said not that, sir—I said not that he was a loyalist,—Ernest Mellichampe, sir, is one of Marion's men.” “Ha!” was the quick exclamation of Tarleton, and his brow was furrowed with a heavy frown as he uttered it. “But not a spy—oh no, sir, not a spy!—an open, avowed, honourable enemy, but no spy. He fought against this man, sir—this man Barsfield—who hates him, sir, and came here only just now, sir—I saw it myself—and would have killed Ernest with his sword, sir, and he senseless, if I had not come between him and the weapon.” “Is this so, Captain Barsfield?” inquired Tarleton, gravely. “The rebel's weapon was uplifted, Colonel Tarleton, and he opposed me when I sought to make him my prisoner.” “Oh! false—false, sir—and foolish as it is false!” was her reply; “for how could he fight, sir, when he was so hurt, and lying almost senseless on the grass?” “He could offer but little resistance, indeed, Captain Barsfield!” remarked Tarleton, sternly and coolly; “and this reminds me that he will the more speedily need the assistance of our surgeon. Here, Decker—Wilson— Broome—go one of you and request Mr. Haddows to prepare himself for a wounded man—sabre-cut, head and shoulder,—away!—and you—a score of you, lift the body and bear it to the house. Tenderly, men— tenderly: if you move so roughly again, Corporal Wilson, I'll cleave you to the chine with my sabre. Ha! he shows his teeth again!—a fierce rebel, doubtless, young lady, and a troublesome one, too, though you speak so earnestly in his behalf.” The latter remark of Tarleton was elicited by the feverish resistance which the partly-aroused Mellichampe now offered to his own removal. The soldiers had sought to wrest his sabre from his grasp, and this again, with the pain of the movement, had provoked his consciousness. He struggled desperately for an instant, gnashed his teeth, threw his eyes round upon the group with an air of defiance even in their vacancy, then closed them again, as he fainted away in a deathlike sickness in the arms which now uplifted him. Janet would have clung still to her lover as they bore him towards the dwelling, but Tarleton interposed. He approached her with a smile of gentleness, which was always beautiful and imposing when it made its appearance upon his habitually sombre features. “Come, Miss Berkeley, let us go forward together. You will not fear to take the arm of one whom you doubtless consider in the character of an enemy—one, probably, of the very worst sort. Your rebel there, in whom you have taken such a sweet interest, has no doubt taught you to believe me so: and you have readily believed all that he has taught you. I see how matters stand between you—nay, blush not—you have nothing to blush for. You have only done your duty—the duty of a woman, always a more delicate, often a more holy, and sometimes a far more arduous duty than any of those which are peculiarly the performance of man. I admire you for what you have done, and you will regard me as a friend hereafter, though I am at war now with some of those whom you love most dearly. This matters nothing with me: nor am I always the stern monster which I appear to so many. I am, they say, fond of blood-spilling, and I fear me that much of what they say is true; but Bannister Tarleton was not always what he now appears. Some of his boy feelings have worked in your favour; and, so long as they last— and Heaven grant that they may last for ever—I will admire your virtues, and freely die to preserve and promote them. Go now and attend upon this youth: and, hear me, young lady, persuade him back to his true allegiance. You will do him as good a service by doing that, as you have done him now. He will be well attended by my own surgeon, and shall want for nothing; but he must remain a prisoner. The charges of Captain Barsfield must be examined into, but he shall have justice.” “Oh! sir, do not believe those charges—do not believe that man. He is a bad man, who personally hates Ernest, and will do all he can to destroy him, as he destroyed his father.” “His father! Yes—yes—I remember. Max Mellichampe—his plantation was called—” “Kaddipah.” “I see! I see!” responded Tarleton, musingly, and his eyes were on the ground; while the sabre, which he had carried in his hand, still in its sheath, came heavily to the earth with a clatter that made the maiden start. A few moments pause ensued, when Tarleton proceeded: “Fear nothing for the safety of the youth. He shall be tried impartially, and treated honourably, though we must now keep him a prisoner, and Barsfield must have his keeping.” “Oh, sir—not Barsfield—anybody else.” “It cannot be,” was the response; “but there is no danger. I shall say but a few words to Barsfield, and Mr. Mellichampe will be much safer in his custody than in that of any other. Take my word that it will be so. You have some prejudices, I perceive, against Barsfield, which do him injustice. You will discover, in the end, that you have wronged him.” “Never, sir, never. You know him not, Colonel Tarleton, you know him not.” “Perhaps not, my dear young lady; but I know that Mr. Mellichampe will be safe after I have given my orders. All I request of you is to be patient. Encourage the prisoner—tell him to fear nothing; and fear nothing yourself.” She hesitated—she would have urged something farther in objecting to Barsfield as the keeper of her lover; but a sudden change came over the countenance of the legionary, even as an unlooked-for cloud enlarges from a scarce perceptible speck, and obscures the hitherto untroubled heavens. His figure suddenly grew erect, and his air was coldly polite, as he checked her in the half-uttered suggestion. “No more, Miss Berkeley, I have determined. The arrangements most proper for all parties shall be made, and all justice shall be done the prisoner. Have no doubts—rely on me, I pray you, and be calm—be confident in the assurances I give you. For once believe that Bannister Tarleton can be humane—that tenderness and justice may both be found at his hands. Go now to your dwelling. You have duties there; and oblige me, if you please, by saying to your father that, if agreeable to him, I will take dinner with him to-day.” He kissed her hand as he was about to leave her, with a grave, manly gallantry, that seemed to take the privilege as a matter of course; and she did not resist him. Murmuring her acknowledgments, she hurried away to the dwelling, and was soon out of sight. Tarleton stood for a few moments watching her progress, with a painful sort of pleasure evident upon his pale countenance, as if some old and sacred memories, suddenly aroused from a long slumber, were busy stirring at his heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 CHAPTER VI. Tarleton, however, whatever may have been his feelings or his thoughts, gave but little time to their present indulgence. As soon as Janet Berkeley was out of sight he again sought out Barsfield, whom he found in no very excellent humour. The tory was mortified on many accounts. He was irritated at the escape of Mellichampe, a second time, from the fate which he had prepared for him, and which, at one moment, he had considered certain. He was annoyed at the sudden appearance of his superior, and that superior Tarleton, just when his controversies with a woman placed him in an attitude so humiliating to a man and a soldier. His brow was clouded, therefore, as these thoughts filled his mind, and the scowl had not left his features when Tarleton again made his appearance. The fierce legionary was a man of promptitude, quick decision, and few words:— “So, Captain Barsfield, this prisoner of yours is the son of Max Mellichampe?” “The same, sir; a malignant I had thought quite too notorious to have escaped your recollection.” “It had not; though, at the moment when I first heard it, I was confounding one name with another in my memory.” “I thought it strange, sir.” “You must have done so,” was the cool reply of Tarleton, “for the fine estate and former possessions of Mellichampe, now yours through our sovereign's favour, are too closely at hand not to have kept the old proprietor in recollection. But our speech is now of the son: what of him, Captain Barsfield?” There was a good deal in this speech to annoy the tory, but he strove successfully to preserve his composure as he replied to the latter part of it. “He, sir, is not less malignant—not less hostile to our cause and sovereign, than his father. He is an exceedingly active officer among the men of Marion; and, like his father, endowed with many of the qualities which would make him troublesome as an enemy. He is brave, and possessed of considerable skill; quite too much not to render it highly advantageous to us to have him a prisoner, and liable to certain penalties as a criminal. It was my surprise, Colonel Tarleton—” and a little hesitation here, in the words and manner of the tory, seemed to denote his own apprehensions of encroaching upon delicate ground quite too far,—“it was my surprise, sir, that, knowing his name and character, you should have proceeded towards him with so much tenderness.” The legionary did not seem to feel the force of the rebuke which this language conveyed. His thoughts were elsewhere, evidently, as he replied, with an inquiring exclamation, “Eh?” “You knew him, sir—a rebel—a spy,—for such I asserted and can prove him to be,—yet you spared him.” “I did,” said Tarleton; “you wonder that I did so. Does your surprise come from the belief that I did him or myself injustice? To what do you ascribe my forbearance? or would you rather have had me truss him up to a tree, because he merited such a doom, or sabre him upon the ground, in order to preserve my consistency?” The tory looked astounded, as well he might. There was a strange tone of irony in the language of Tarleton, and the words themselves had a signification quite foreign to the wonted habit of the latter. He knew not how to construe the object or the precise nature of the question. The whole temper of the fierce legionary seemed to have undergone a change, and was now a mystery to Barsfield, as it had been a wonder to the men around them. There was a sarcastic smile on the lips of the speaker, accompanying his words, which warned the tory to be heedful of the sort of reply to which he should give utterance. He paused, therefore, for a few moments, in order so to digest his answer as to guard it from every objectionable expression; yet he spoke with sufficient promptitude to avoid the appearance of premeditating what he said. “Surely, Colonel Tarleton, the rebel who resists should die in his resistance—” “But when wounded, Barsfield—when wounded, and at your feet—” was the abrupt interruption of Tarleton, who certainly did not diminish the surprise of Barsfield while thus making a suggestion of mercy to the conqueror. The tory could not forbear a sarcasm: with a smile, therefore, he proceeded:— “And yet, Colonel Tarleton, it has seldom been the case that you have left to his majesty's enemies, even when you have overthrown them, a second opportunity of lifting arms against him.” The bitter smile passed from the lips of the legionary, and his eye rested sternly upon the face of the tory. The sarcasm was evidently felt, and, for a few moments, there was in Tarleton's bosom something of that fierce fire which, at one period, would have replied to the sharp word with the sharper sword, and to the idle sneer with a busy weapon. But the sternness of his brow, a moment after, became subdued to mere seriousness, as he replied— “It is true, Captain Barsfield, my sabre has perhaps been sufficiently unsparing. I have been a man of blood; and heretofore, I have thought, with sufficient propriety. I have deemed it my duty to leave my king as few enemies as possible, and I have not often paused to consider of the mode by which to get rid of them; but—” He did not conclude the sentence. His face was turned away from the listener. Thought seemed to gather, like a cloud, upon his mind; and a gloomy and dark hue obscured his otherwise pale features. The tory regarded him with increased surprise as he again addressed him; he could no longer conceal his astonishment at the change in the mood and habits of the speaker. “May I ask,” he continued, “what has wrought the alteration which I cannot but see now in your deportment, Colonel Tarleton?” “Is it not enough,” was the quick response of the legionary, “that Cornwallis has grown merciful of late?” “It has been of late that he has become so,” said Barsfield, with a smile; “only since the battle of Gum Swamp, may we reckon?” “He, at least, requires that I shall be so,” said Tarleton, calmly, “though the indulgence of a different temper he still appears to keep in reserve for himself. He would monopolize the pleasure of the punishment, and, perhaps, the odium of it also. That, at least, I do not envy him.” “And in that respect your own mood seems to have undergone a change which could not have been produced by any command of his?” Barsfield was venturing upon dangerous ground in this remark, but he presumed thus freely as he listened to the tacit censure which Tarleton had expressed in reference to the conduct of his superior. “It has, Captain Barsfield, and the proof of it is to be found in the proceedings of this day. Under your representations I should, at another time, with the full sanction of Cornwallis, have strung up this rebel Mellichampe to the nearest tree, though but a few moments of life were left him by the doubtful mercies of your 4* sabre or mine. I have not done so; and my own mood is accountable for the change, rather than the orders of my superior. The truth is, I am sick of blood after the strife is over; and I relieve myself of the duties of the executioner by the alteration of my feelings in this respect. Mellichampe will, perhaps, complain of my mercy. He must remain your prisoner, to be carefully kept by you, for trial in Charleston, as soon as his wounds will permit of his removal to the city. An execution is wanted there, for example, in that unruly city; and this youth, coming of good family, and an active insurgent, is well chosen as the proper victim. I am instructed to secure another for this purpose, and my pursuit now is partly for this object. Two such subjects as Walton and Mellichampe, carted to an ignominious death through the streets of Charleston, will have the proper effect upon these insolent citizens, who growl where they dare not bite, and sneer at the authority which yet tramples them into the dust. You must keep this youth safely for this purpose, Captain Barsfield; I shall look to you that he escape not, and that every attendance and all care be given him, so that he may, as soon as possible, prepare for his formal trial, and, as I think, for his final execution. My own surgeon shall remain with him, the better to facilitate these ends, which, as you value your own loyalty, you will do your utmost to promote.” “Am I to remain here, then, Colonel Tarleton? Shall I not proceed to Baynton's Meadow, agreeably to the original plan, and afterward establish myself in post at Kaddipah?” “No! you must establish yourself here. The position is safer and better suited to our purposes than Kaddipah. Surround yourself with stockades, and summon the surrounding inhabitants. The probability is, that you are too late for the gathering at Baynton's Meadow. I fear me that Marion is there now. You should have crossed the river yesterday; the delay is perhaps as fatal in its consequences as it was unadvised and injudicious. But it is too late now to think upon. To-morrow I will move to Baynton's Meadow, if I do not first find Marion in the swamp.” The conference was interrupted at this moment by the approach of Blonay. His features suddenly caught the eye of the legionary, who called him forward. The Half-Breed, with his ancient habit, stood leaning against a neighbouring tree, seeming not to observe any thing, yet observing all things; and, with a skill which might not readily be augured from his dull, inexpressive eye and visage, searching closely into the bosoms of those whom he surveyed, through the medium of those occasional expressions of countenance, which usually run along with feeling and indicate its presence. “Ah! you are the scout,” said Tarleton. “Come forward; I would speak with you.” The Half-Breed stood before him. “And you promise that you can guide me directly to the camp of the rebel Marion?” “Yes, colonel, I can.” “You have seen it yourself?” “I have, colonel.” “Unseen by any of the rebel force?” “Yes, colonel.” “Can you guide us there, too, undiscovered?” “Adrat it—yes—if the scouts ain't out. When I went the scouts were all in, since there was no alarm, and Marion was guine upon an expedition.” “What expedition?” “Well, I don't know, colonel—somewhere to the north, I reckon—down about Waccamaw.” “And suppose his scouts are out now—will they see us—can we not make our way undiscovered?” “'Taint so easy, colonel; there's no better scouts in natur than the `swamp fox' keeps. They will dodge all day long in one thicket from the best ten men of the legion.” “Is there no way of misleading the scouts?” “None, colonel, that I knows. If you could send out a strong party of the horse in a different direction, as if you was trying to get round them, you might trick the old fox into believing it; but that's not so easy to do. He's mighty shy, and ain't to be caught with chaff.” “Nor will I try any such experiment. Hark'ee, fellow: if I find that you deceive me, I shall not stop a moment to give your throat the surety of a strong cord. Your counsels to break my force, to be cut up when apart, are those of one who is drawing both right and left, and argues but little respect for my common sense. But I will trust you so far as you promise. You shall guide me to the hole of the fox, and I will do the rest. Guide me faithfully, and stick close to your promise, and I will reward you; betray me, deceive me, or even look doubtfully in our progress, and, so sure as I value the great trust in my hands, your doom is written. Away now, and be ready with the dawn.” The scout bowed and retired. The moment that his back had been turned upon the speaker, Tarleton motioned two soldiers, who stood at a little distance, and who kept their eyes ever watchfully upon Blonay. They turned away at the signal, and followed the scout at a respectful distance, but one not too great to render the escape of the suspected person at all easy. Every precaution was taken to prevent the scout from noticing this surveillance; but the half-oblique eye which he cast over his shoulder at intervals upon the two, must have taught any one at all familiar with the character of the Half-Breed, that he was not unconscious of the close attention thus bestowed upon him. He walked away unconcernedly, however, and it was not long before, upon the edge of the forest, he had gained a favourite tree, against the sunny side of which he leaned himself quietly, as if all the cares and even the consciousness of existence had long since departed from his mind. It was in this spot, an hour after, that he was sought out by Barsfield. The tory captain had some cause of displeasure with the scout, who had evaded his expressed wish to gain the clew to the retreat of Marion. He had other causes of displeasure, which the dialogue between them subsequently unfolded. “Where did you meet with Colonel Tarleton to-day, Mr. Blonay? You had no knowledge of his approach?” “None, cappin—I heard his trumpet a little way off, when I was making a roundabout for the swamp thicket, and he came upon me with a few dragoons afore I seed him.” “It is strange, Mr. Blonay, that a good scout, such as you are, should be so easily found when not desiring it. Are you sure that you tried to keep out of his way?” “No, cappin—there was no reason for me to try, for I saw first that they were friends and not rebels; and so I didn't push to hide, as I might have done, easy enough.” “And by what means did Colonel Tarleton discover that you could lead him to the camp of Marion, unless you studiously furnished him with your intelligence?” “I did tell him, cappin, when he axed me. He axed me if I knowed, and I said I did, jist the same as I said to you; and he then axed me to show him, and I said I could.” “But why, when I asked you, did you deny your ability to show me the way? Was it because you looked for better pay at the hands of Tarleton?” “No, cappin: but you didn't ax me to show you— you only axed me to describe it, and that I couldn't do. I can go over the ground, cappin, jist like a dog; but I can't tell the name of the tree that I goes by, or this bush, or that branch; and I haint any name for the thicket I creeps through. I knows them all when I sees them, and I can't miss them any more than the good hound when he's once upon trail; but, if you was to hang me, I couldn't say it to you in talking, so that you could find it out for yourself.” Blonay was right in a portion of his statement, but his correctness was only partial. He could not, indeed, have described his course; but he had been really averse to unfolding it to Barsfield, and he had, with the view to a greater reward, thrown himself in the way of Tarleton, of whose approach he had been apprized. He was true, in all respects, to the simple and selfish principle upon which his education had been grounded by his miserable mother. Barsfield had no farther objection to urge on the subject. He was entirely deceived by the manner of the scout. But there was yet another topic of interest between them, and to this he called his attention. “You have not yet been successful with this boy?— he lives yet—” “Yes, but you have him now, and he can't help himself. He is under your knife.” “Ay!” exclaimed the tory, with an expression of countenance the most awfully stern, and with a tone of concentrated bitterness,—“ay! but I am as far off— farther off, indeed—than ever. My hands are tied; he is intrusted to my charge in particular, and my own fidelity is interested in preserving him.” “Eh?” was the simple and interrogative monosyllable with which the scout replied to what was too nice a subtlety in morals to be easily resolvable by a mind so unconventional as his own. Barsfield saw the difficulty, and tried to explain. “I cannot violate a trust which is confided to me. I must preserve and protect, and even fight against his enemies, so long as he remains in my custody.” “He is your enemy?” said Blonay, still wholly uninfluenced by the remark of Barsfield. “Yes, he is still my enemy.” “And you his?” “Yes.” “He is aneath your knife?” “Yes, entirely.” The savage simply replied by taking his knife from its sheath and drawing its back across his own neck, while his countenance expressed all the fierce emotions of one engaged in the commission of a murder. The face of Barsfield took no small portion of the same fierce expression: catching the hand of the speaker firmly in his own, he replied— “Ay, and no stroke would give me more pleasure than that. It would be life to me—his death,—and why may it not be done? It may be done! Blonay, we will speak again of this; but be silent now, keep close, and tell me where I may look for you to-night?” “There!” and he pointed to a little swamp or bay, in which he had slept before. It lay at the distance of a mile, more or less, from the camp, which had been already formed in the park, and near the yet consuming mansion. “There—I keep in the bay at night; for, though it taint got no cypresses, sich as I used to love down upon the Ashley, and about Dorchester, yet it's a close place, and the tupolas and gums is mighty thick. You'll find me there any time afore cockcrow. You have only to blow in your hands three times—so—” producing a singular and shrill whistle at the same time, by an application of his mouth to an aperture left between his otherwise closed palms,—“only blow so three times, and I'll be with you.” The tory captain tried to produce the desired sounds, in the suggested manner, which he at length succeeded in doing. Satisfied, therefore, with the arrangement, he left his accomplice to the contemplation of his own loneliness, and hurried away to his duties in the camp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Meanwhile the hurts of Mellichampe had all been carefully attended to. Tarleton, so far, had kept his pledged word to the maiden. He was removed to a chamber in the house which gave temporary shelter to the family, and the surgeon of the legionary colonel had himself attended to his injuries. They were found to be rather exhausting than dangerous. A slight sabre-stroke upon his head had stunned him for the time, but afforded no matter for very serious consideration. The severest wound was the cut over the left shoulder, which had bled profusely; but even this required little more than close attendance and occasional dressing. A good nurse was more important than a skilful surgeon, and no idle and feeble scruples of the inferior mind stood in the way to prevent Janet Berkeley from devoting herself to the performance of this duty to her betrothed. The intelligence of Mellichampe's true situation was conveyed by Tarleton himself to Mr. Berkeley, in the presence of his daughter. It seemed intended to, and did, reassure the maiden, whose warm interest in the captive was sufficiently obvious to all; as her tearful and deep apprehensions on his account, and for his safety, had been entirely beyond her power of concealment. Tarleton dined that day with the Berkeley family. His manners were grave, but gentle—somewhat reserved, perhaps, but always easy, and sometimes elegant. He spoke but little, yet what he said contributed, in no small degree, to elevate him in the respect of all around. His air was subdued, when he spoke, to a woman-mildness; and his words were usually uttered in a low, soft tone, little above a common whisper, yet sufficiently measured and slow in their utterance to be heard without difficulty by those to whom they were addressed. What a difference was there between the same man sitting at the hospitable board, and, when leading forward his army but a few hours before, he rushed headlong, with kindled and raging spirit, upon the tracks of his flying foe! There was nothing now in his look or language which could indicate the savage soldier. Was he, indeed, the same bloodthirsty warrior, whose renown, by no means an enviable one, had been acquired by the most wanton butcheries in the fields of Carolina? This was the inquiry in the minds of all those who now looked upon him. Certainly a most remarkable alteration seemed, in the eyes of all who before had known him, in a little time to have come over the spirit of the fierce warrior; and it is somewhat singular and worthy of remark, that he gained no distinction, and won no successes of any moment, after this period. His achievements were few and unimportant; and two repulses which he received at the hands of Sumter, followed up, as they were, by the terrible defeat which he sustained at the Cowpens, finished his career as a favourite of fortune in the partisan warfare of the south. His name lost its terrors soon after this among those with whom it had previously been so potent; and, though his valour was at all periods above suspicion, yet, in his reverses, it became the fashion to disparage his soldierly skill, even among those whom he commanded. It was then discovered that he had only contended, hitherto, with raw militiamen, whom it required but little merit, beyond that of mere brute courage, to overthrow; and that his successes entirely ceased from the moment when that same militia, taught by severe and Vol. II.—C 5 repeated experience of defeat, had acquired, in time, some little of the address of regular and practised warfare. There was, no doubt, much that was sound in this opinion. But—the dinner was fairly over, and Tarleton withdrew, after a few moments devoted to pleasant conversation with the now composed Rose Duncan, from whose mind all the terrors of the previous combat, in which she had shared so much, seemed entirely to have gone. She was only a creature of passing impressions. To Janet he said but little; but his eyes sometimes rested upon her with an air of melancholy abstraction, which gave to his otherwise pale features an expression of feeling and nice sensibilities, which his profession might seem to belie. But, before he took his departure, he led her aside to a window in the cottage, and thus addressed her, in the style of one sufficiently her friend and senior to speak firmly and directly, even on a topic the most difficult and delicate in the estimation of a maiden. “I have given Captain Barsfield his orders touching our prisoner, Miss Berkeley,—perhaps it would not be unpleasing to you to know what those orders are?” She looked down, and her desire to hear was sufficiently shown in her unwillingness to speak. He proceeded, after a brief pause, in the course of which his lips put on the same sweet smile of graciousness which had won the heart of the maiden before; while, at the same time, it commanded a something more in the way of return than a mere corresponding deference of manner. So foreign to his lips was that expression—so adverse to his general character was that smile of gentleness, that, even while it gratified her to behold it, she looked up to the wearer of it with a feeling little short of awe. “Mr. Mellichampe is in no danger—no present danger —as my surgeon informs me; but he must be kept quiet and without interruption until well, as he appears feverish, and his mind seems disposed to wander. The better to effect this object, I have ordered that, except my surgeon and his assistant, none but your father and yourself shall be admitted to his chamber. I have made this exception in your favour, Miss Berkeley, as my surgeon at the same time informs me that he will need the offices of a careful nurse—” “Oh, sir—” was the involuntary exclamation of Janet, as she heard this language; but Tarleton did not allow her to proceed. “No idle objections, my dear young lady—no false notions of propriety and a misplaced delicacy at this moment. I know sufficiently your secret; which is no secret now to any in our troop. Your duty commands that you attend this young man, and none but the feeble mind will find any fault with you for its performance. In matters of this sort, your own heart is the best judge, and to that I leave it, whether you will avail yourself of the privilege which I have granted you or not. The youth is in no danger, says my surgeon, but he may be if he is not carefully nursed. Pardon me for so long detaining you—I shall do so no longer. My orders are given to secure you at all times admission to the chamber of Mr. Mellichampe, should you desire it.” “But, oh! sir—what of Captain Barsfield? These charges—” “Are slight, no doubt, but must be inquired into. Mr. Mellichampe is the prisoner of Captain Barsfield, and must await his trial. I can do nothing farther, unless it be to promise that all justice shall be done him.” “But may he not be put in other hands, Colonel Tarleton, than those of Captain Barsfield? Oh! sir— I dread that man. He will do Mellichampe some harm.” “Fear not—Captain Barsfield dare not harm him— he has quite too much at venture. It is for this very reason, with the view to the perfect security of the prisoner, that I have made Barsfield his keeper. His fidelity C 2 is pledged for the security of his charge, and I have dwelt upon the responsibility to him in such language as will make him doubly careful. But you do Captain Barsfield wrong—he has no such design as that you speak of —his hostility to Mr. Mellichampe is simply that of the soldier towards his enemy. Unless in fair fight, I am sure he would never do him harm.” Janet shook her head doubtfully as she replied, “I know him better, sir,—I know that he hates Mellichampe for many reasons—but I may not doubt the propriety of your arrangements. I will, sir, take advantage of the permission made in my favour, and will myself become the nurse of Mr. Mellichampe. Why should I be afraid or ashamed, sir? Am I not his betrothed—his wife in the sight of Heaven? I will be his nurse—why should I be ashamed?” “Ay—why should you, Miss Berkeley? Truth and virtue may well be fearless, at all times, of human opinion; and they cease to be truth and virtue when the fear of what men may think, or say, induces a disregard of that which they conceive to be their duty. With me you lose nothing by the declaration you have just made. It is one I looked for from you. The confidence of virtue is never unworthy of the source from which it springs, and it doubly confirms and strengthens virtue itself, when it shows the possessor to be resolute after right, without regard to human arrangements, or the petty and passing circumstances of society. It is the child's love that is driven from its ground by the dread of social scandal. The only love that man esteems valuable is that which can dare all things, but wrong, in behalf of the valued object. This is your love now, and you have my prayer —if the prayer of a rough soldier like myself be not a wrong to so pure a spirit—that it be always hallowed in the sight of Heaven, and successful beyond the control of earth.” He took a respectful parting, and, on leaving her to rejoin the party, his manner changed to that of the proud man he commonly appeared. An inflexible sternness sat upon his pale and stonelike countenance—the lips were set rigidly—the eye was shrouded by the overhanging brow, that gathered above it like some heavy cloud over some flaming and malignant planet. He spoke but few words to the rest of the family. A cold word of acknowledgment to Mr. Berkeley—a courteous bow and farewell to Rose Duncan, whose confidence was now half restored, the din of battle being over—and a single look and partial smile to Janet, preceded his immediate departure to the edge of the forest, where, during the dinner repast, his temporary camp had been formed. From this point he threw out his sentinels and sent forth his scouting parties. These latter traversed the neighbouring hummocks, and ransacked every contiguous cover, in which a lurking squad of rebels might have taken up a hiding-place, in waiting for the moment when a fancied security on the part of the foe should invite to the work of annoyance or assault. Such was the nature of the Indian warfare which the “swamp fox,” with so much general success, had adopted as his own. Tarleton knew too well the danger of surprise, with a foe so wary in his neighbourhood, and accordingly spared none of those precautions to which, in ordinary cases, hitherto, he had been rather indifferent. He cited Blonay before him on reaching his camp—examined him closely as to the route they were next day to pursue, and concluded by warning him to be in readiness with the dawn of day. “You shall be well rewarded if we succeed,” were his concluding words to the scout—“well rewarded if you are faithful, even though we do not succeed; but if you fail me, sirrah—if I catch you playing me false— the first tree and a short cord are your certain doom.” The Half-Breed touched his cap, and, without showing any emotion at this language, retired from the presence of the legionary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">5* CHAPTER VIII. That night, as soon as he deemed it prudent, Barsfield, punctual to his engagement with the Half-Breed, left the camp, and, without observation, proceeded to the place of meeting which had been determined upon between them. He was not long in finding the person he sought. Blonay was no less punctual than his employer, and the shrill whistle of the latter, thrice repeated through his folded hands, soon brought him from his cover. The Half-Breed answered the signal readily, and in a few moments after emerged from the hummock in which, with a taste of his own, he had taken up his abode. A dim light was shining from the sky, only sufficient to enable the tory to recognise the outline, but not the several features, of his companion's person. Blonay freely extended his hand, and the fleshless, bony fingers took in their grasp those of Barsfield, who did not hesitate to follow his guidance, though he somewhat loathed the gripe of his conductor. “Why go farther,—why not remain and talk here?” was his demand. “There's no telling, cappin, who's a listening. Singleton's men's watching me now; and Colonel Tarleton, he doesn't trust me, and there's two of the dragoons that's kept close on my heels ever since I seed him last. It's true I dodged 'em when the sun went down, but they're on the look-out yet, I reckon.” “And why did you dodge them—you didn't mean to run?” demanded the other. “No, but I'd rather a man shoot me than peep over my shoulder; it's like a log round the neck, to be always looked after.” “And wny do you think that Singleton's men are also looking out for you?” “'Cause one of them knows I'm in these parts, and he knows I'm dangerous.” “But can he find you?” “He's a born swamp-sucker like myself, and he's dangerous too. He know's I'm hereabouts, and I reckon he can't sleep easy till he finds me—or I find him.” Barsfield no longer objected, and together they penetrated the covert until they reached a dry spot, where, with a fancy as natural as it was peculiar, the Half-Breed had chosen his temporary dwelling, in preference to that of the camp or plantation. A few brands of the resinous pine, in which commodity the country around was abundantly supplied, were huddled together and in a blaze, which, though bright enough to illumine all objects around them, was imperceptible on the outer edge of the hummock, from the exceeding density of its foliage. A huge gum-tree, that stood upon the bank, sent up bulgingly above the surface a monstrous series of roots, which, covered with fresh moss, had made the pillow of the inhabitant. A thick coat of clustering oak-leaves, the tribute of a tree that had made such a deposite, probably, for a hundred winters, composed the sylvan couch of the outlier, while the folding and thicklyleaved branches overhead afforded him quite as gracious a cover from the unfriendly dews as it was in the nature of a form so callous to need or to desire. But the place seemed cheerless to Barsfield, in spite of the genial temperature of the season, and the bright flame burning before him. “And you sleep here, Mr. Blonay?” was his involuntary question. “Yes, cappin, here or further in the bush. If I hear strange noises that I don't like, I slips down further into the bay, and then I'm sure to be safe, for it's a mighty troublesome way to take, and very few people like to hunt in such bottoms; it's all sloppy, and full of holes, and the water's as black as pitch.” “What noise is that?” said Barsfield. “Oh, that!—that's only my big alligator: I can tell his voice from all the rest, for it sounds hoarse, as if he had cotched a cold from coming out too soon last May. He's a mighty big fellow, and keeps in a deep dirty pond jist to the back of you. I shouldn't be supprised to see him crawling out this way directly; he sometimes does when I'm lying here in the daytime.” Barsfield started and looked round him, as an evident rustling in the rear seemed to confirm the promise of Blonay. The latter smiled as he proceeded— “Don't be scared, cappin, for if a body ain't scared he can't do no harm with 'em. When he comes out and looks at me, I jist laughs at him, and claps my hands, and he takes to his heels directly. They won't trouble you much only when they're mighty hungry, and ain't seed hog-meat for a long time, and then they won't trouble you if you make a great noise and splash the water at 'em.” “Why don't you shoot him?” “Adrat it! I didn't load for him: it's no use,—if I had been to shoot alligators, I needn't have come up from Goose Creek. I could have had my pick there, at any time, of a dozen, jist as big and not so hoarse as this fellow: I picked my bullet for quite another sort of varmint.” “And what of him—have you seen him?” “Yes,” was the single and almost stern reply. “Within rifle shot?” “Not twenty yards off,” was the immediate answer. “And why did you spare him?” “Other people was with him: I would have shot him by himself.” “I see; you had no wish to be cut up immediately after. Your hatred to your enemy, Blonay, does not blind you to the wisdom of escaping after you have murdered him?” The Half-Breed did not seem to understand what Barsfield said; but his own meaning was so obvious to himself, that he did not appear to think it necessary to repeat his words, or undertake more effectually to explain them. His, indeed, was the true Indian warfare, as, in great part, his was the Indian blood and temper. To win every advantage—to secure success and triumph without risk and with impunity, are the principles of the savage nature always; and to obtain revenge without corresponding disadvantage, makes the virtue of such an achievement. These, indeed, may be held the principles of every people conscious of inferiority to those whom they oppose and hate. So far the dialogue between Barsfield and his comrade had been carried on without any reference to the particular subject of interest which filled the bosom of the former. He seemed reluctant to speak farther upon this topic; and, when he did speak, his reluctance, still preserved, produced a halting and partial utterance only of his feelings and desires, as if he somewhat repented of the degree of confidence which he had already reposed in the person to whom he spoke. But the desire to avail himself of the services of this man, and the consciousness of having already gone so far as to make any future risk of this sort comparatively unimportant, at length impelled him to a full expression of his desire to get Mellichampe out of his way, and, with this object, to hear from Blonay, and to suggest himself sundry plans for this purpose. The great difficulty consisted in the position of Barsfield himself, in relation to the prisoner so particularly intrusted to his charge by Tarleton, and with orders so imperative and especial. This was the grand difficulty, which it required all the ingenuity of Barsfield to surmount. Had Mellichampe been C 3 the prisoner of Tarleton, or of any other person than Barsfield himself, the murder of the youth would most probably have been effected that very night, such was the unscrupulous hatred of the tory, if not of Blonay. For the present we may say, that the Half-Breed might not so readily have fallen into any plan of Barsfield which would have made him the agent in the commission of the deed. “You go with Tarleton to-morrow: you will not keep with him, for he goes down to Baynton's Meadow. When do you return?” “Well, now, there's no telling, cappin, seeing as how the colonel may want me to go 'long with him.” “He will not, when you have shown him to the camp of Marion.” “Well, if so be he don't, I'll be back mighty soon after I leaves him. I don't want to go with him, 'cause I knows there's no finding a man's enemy in pertic'lar, when there's a big company 'long.” “It is well. You will be back, then, by to-morrow night, and I will then put you upon a plan which will enalbe you to get this boy out of the way for me.” “Well, but, cappin, ha'nt you got him now? It's mighty easy now, as I tell'd you before, to do for him yourself.” “You do not seem to understand, Blonay. I am prevented from doing any thing, as Tarleton has made me directly responsible for the appearance of the prisoner.” “Adrat it, who's to know when the colonel's gone? The chap's hurt and sick. Reckon he can die by natur.” Barsfield understood him, and replied— “Yes, and nature might be helped in his case, but that Tarleton's own surgeon and assistants remain, and none but the Berkeley family are to be admitted to the prisoner. If I could report at my pleasure on his condition, it might easily be done; but I cannot. It must be done by another, if done at all, and in such a way as will show that I could have had no hand in it. I have a plan in my mind for this purpose, which you shall execute on your return, by which means I shall avoid these difficulties. You are willing?” “Well, yes, I reckon. It don't take much to finish a chap that's half dead already; but—I say, cappin— does you really think now that that 'ere gal has a notion for him?” The question seemed to Barsfield exceedingly impertinent, and he replied with a manner sufficiently haughty. “What matters it to you, sirrah, whether she has such a notion or not? How does it concern you?— and what should you know of love?” “No harm, cappin—I doesn't mean any harm; it don't consarn me, that's true. But, adrat it, cappin, she's mighty fine gal: and she does look so sweet and so sorry all the time, jist as if she wouldn't hurt a mean crawling black spider that was agin the wall.” Barsfield looked with some surprise at the speaker, as he heard him utter a language so like that of genuine feeling, and in tones that seemed to say that he felt it; and he was about to make some remark when Blonay, who had stood during this dialogue leaning with his shoulder against a tree, and his head down in a listless manner upon his bosom, now started into an attitude and expression of the most watchful consciousness. A pause of a few moments ensued, when, hearing nothing, Barsfield was about to go on with the speech which the manner of his companion had interrupted, when the Half-Breed again stopped him with a whisper, while his finger rested upon the arm of the tory in cautious warning. “Hist; I hear them—there are no less than three feet in that swamp—don't you hear them walking in the water? There, now. You hear when the flat of the foot comes down upon the water.” “I hear nothing,” said Barsfield. Without a word, the Half-Breed stooped to the single brand that was now blazing near them, and gathering a double handful of dirt from the little hillock, he threw it upon the flame and extinguished it in an instant. The next moment they heard the distant crackling of dry sticks and a rustling among the leaves. “It may be your great alligator,” said Barsfield. “No—it's men—Marion's men, I reckon—and there's three of them, at least. They are spying on the camp. Lie close.” Barsfield did not immediately stoop, and the Half-Breed did not scruple to grasp his arm with an urgency and force which brought the tory captain forward. He trod heavily as he did so upon a cluster of the dried leaves which had formed the couch of Blonay, and a slight whistle reached their ears a moment after, and then all was silence. The tory and his companion crouched together behind the huge gum under which the latter had been accustomed to sleep, and thus they remained without a word for several minutes. No sound in all that time came to their senses; and Barsfield, rather more adventurous than Blonay, or less taught in the subtleties of swamp warfare, tired of his position, arose slowly from the ground and thrust his head from behind the tree, endeavouring, in the dim light that occasionally stole from the heavens into those deep recesses, to gather what he could of the noises which had disturbed them. The hand of the Half-Breed, grasping the skirts of his coat, had scarcely drawn him back into the shelter of the tree, when the whizzing of the bullet through the leaves, and the sharp crack of the rifle, warned him of his own narrow escape, and of the close proximity of danger. “I knows where they are now,” said Blonay, in a whisper, changing his position; “we are safe enough if you can stick close to me, cappin.” “Lead on—I'll follow,” was the reply, in the same low whisper which conveyed the words of Blonay. The Half-Breed instantly hurled a huge half-burnt chunk of wood through the bushes before him, the noise of which he necessarily knew would call the eyes of the scouts in that direction; then, in the next instant, bounding to the opposite side, he took his way between two clumps of bays which grew in the miry places along the edge of the tussock on which they had been standing. Barsfield followed closely and without hesitation, though far from escaping so well the assaults of the briers and bushes upon his cheeks. His guide, with a sort of instinct, escaped all these smaller assailants, and, though he heard the footsteps behind of his pursuers, he did not now apprehend any danger, either for himself or his companion, having thrown the thick growth of bays between them. The party which so nearly effected the surprise of the two conspirators came out of their lurking-place an instant after their flight. The conjecture of the Half-Breed had been correct. They were the men of Marion. “You fired too soon, Lance,” were the words of Humphries, “and the skunk is off. Had you waited but a little longer we should have had him safe enough. Now there's no getting him, for he has too greatly the start of us.” “I couldn't help it, Mr. Humphries. I saw the shiny buttons, and I thought I had dead aim upon him.” “But how comes he with shiny buttons, John Davis?” said Humphries, quickly. “When you saw him to-day he had on a blue homespun, did he not?” “Yes—I seed him plain enough,” said Davis, “and I could swear to the homespun—but didn't you hear as if two was walking together?” “No. 6 “Well, I did; and 'twas reasonable I should hear before you, seeing I was ahead. I heard them clear enough—first one and then t'other—and one walked in the water while t'other was on the brush.” “D—n the skunk—that I should lose him—it's all your fault, Lance. You're too quick and hot-headed nowadays, and it'll be a long time before you can be a good swamp fox, unless you go more slowly, and learn to love less the sound of your rifle. But it's useless to stay here now, and we've got other work to do. Our sport's spoiled for this time, and all we can do is to take off as quick as we can; for it won't be long before the scouts of Tarleton will be poking here after us. That shot must bring them in this direction, so we'll push round to the opposite side of the bay, where the rest of the red-coats are in camp.” “But, Mr. Humphries, can't I go now and pick off that sentry we passed by the avenue?” demanded Lance Frampton, with much earnestness. “No—d—n the sentry; if you had picked off this skunk of a Half-Breed, it would have been something now I should have thanked you for—that's what I mostly come after. As for the other—there's too much risk now. We must take a cross track, and get round to the river by the gum-flats. Come, push—away.” They had scarcely moved off when a stir and hum in the direction of Tarleton's camp announced to them that the alarm had been given, and hurried the preparations of Humphries for their departure. The scouts of Barsfield, led by the tory himself, and guided by Blonay, after a while, scoured narrowly the recesses of the bay: but the men of Marion had melted away like spectres in the distant woods; and, chafed and chagrined, the tory went back to his quarters, fatigued with the unprofitable pursuit, and irritated into sleeplessness, as he found himself in the close neighbourhood of a foe so wary and so venturesome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. At day-dawn the next morning the trumpet of the legion sounded shrilly over the grounds where Tarleton, during the night, had made his encampment. With the signal each trooper was at his post. Tarleton himself was already dressed, and about to buckle the heavy sabre at his side which his arm had ever been so proverbially ready to wield. The fire—the stern enthusiasm —which grew out of his impatience for the strife, already glowed balefully and bright upon his countenance. He was joined at this moment by another—an officer—a man something his senior, and, like him, accustomed, seemingly, to command. “Your trumpets sound unseasonably, Tarleton, and destroyed as pleasant a vision as ever came from the land of dreams. I fancied the wars were over—that I was once again in Old England, with all the little ones and their sweet dam about me, and your heartless trumpet took them all from my embrace—all at one fell swoop.” Tarleton smiled, but smiled in such a sort that the speaker almost blushed to have made his confession of domestic tenderness to such uncongenial ears. He continued— “But you care nothing for these scenes, and scruple not to break into such pleasures to destroy. You have no such sweet cares troubling you at home.” “None, Moncrieff—none, or few. Perhaps I might please no less than- surprise you, were I to say that I wish I had; but I will not yield you so much sympathy; particularly, indeed, as there is no time for these matters or such talk when we are on the eve of grappling with an enemy.” “Enemy! what enemy?” demanded the other. “Our old enemy, the `swamp fox,” responded Tarleton, coolly. “What, Marion!—why, where is he?” “But a few miles off. I hope to have late breakfast with him—time serving, God willing, and our appetite for fight as good as that for breakfast.” “But know you where he is, and how? Will he stand for your coming? Will he not fly, as usual—double himself round a cypress while you are piercing your way through its bowels?” “Ay, doubtless, if he can—we must try to prevent that; and I have hopes that we can do it. His scouts have been around us, like so many vultures, all night; and Barsfield reports that one has had the audacity to fire upon a sentinel. This shows him to be at hand, and in sufficient force to warrant the belief that he will stand a brush.” “But how find him, Tarleton? His own men cannot easily do that, and you have never yet been allowed to see his feathers.” “I shall now, however, I think—for I perceive our guide stands in readiness. Look at him, Moncrieff—did you ever see such a creature? Look at his eyes—do they not give you pain—positive pain, to survey them? They seem only to be kept in his head by desperate effort; and yet, behold his form. He does not appear capable of effort—scarcely, indeed, of movement. His limbs seem hung on hinges, and one leg, as you perceive, appears always, as now, to have thrown the whole weight of the body upon the other.” “A strange monster, indeed: and is that the creature to serve you? Can he put you on the trail?” “He pledges himself to do so. He has seen the `swamp fox' and his men, all at ease, in their camp, and promises that I shall see them too, under his guidance.” “And you will trust him?” “I will.” “What security have you that he does not carry you into trap?” “His own neck; for, as sure as he makes a false move, he swings from the nearest sapling. He shall be watched.” “If this be the case, Tarleton, how can you go forward? Will it not be for me then to execute my mission?” “Not till I fail. If I can drub Marion, and either put him to death or make a prisoner of him, your mission will be null. There will be no use in buying one whom we can beat. But, if he now escapes me, I give it up. He would escape the devil. You may then seek him out with your most pacific aspect—offer him his pension and command among us, as our sagacious commander-in-chief has already devised, and make the best use afterward of his skill in baffling Green, as he so long has baffled us. If he does half so well for his majesty as for his continental prog-princes, he will be worth quite as much as you offer for him, and something more.” “True—but, Tarleton, this chance may never offer again. We may never get a guide who will be able to pilot me through these d—d impervious and pestilential morasses—certainly few to show me where to find him out.” “We must risk that, Moncrieff. I will not give up my present chance of striking him, though you never have the opportunity you seek. He has baffled me too long already, and my pride is something interested to punish him. The prospect is a good one, and I will not lose it. Hark you, fellow!” The last words were addressed to Blonay, who, in sight of the speaker all the while, now approached at the order. The stern, stony eye of the fierce legionary rested upon him searchingly, with a penetrating glance scarcely to be withstood by any gaze, and certainly not 6* by that of the Half-Breed, who never looked any one in the face. Some seconds elapsed before Tarleton spoke, and when he did his words were cold, slow, brief, and to the purpose. “You are ready, sir?” The reply was affirmative. “You hold to your assertion that you can lead me to where Marion camps?” “I can lead you, sir, to his camp, but I can't say for his being in it. He may get wind of you, if his scouts happen to be out.” “I know, I know—you said this before, and proposed, if I remember rightly, that I should divide my force in order to mislead. But I know better than to do that. I risk nothing now when I know nothing of his force, and I am not so sure, sir, that you are altogether the man to be relied on. I shall watch you, sirrah; and remember, it is easier, fellow, to hang you up to a bough than to threaten it. Go—prepare. Ho! there, Hodgson—put half a dozen of your best dragoons in charge of this guide, and keep him safe, as you value whole bones.” “I will not run, sir,” said Blonay, looking up for the first time into the face of Tarleton. “I know that, sir—you shall not,” responded the other, coolly. The signal to move was given in a few moments after, and Barsfield saw the departure of Tarleton in pursuit of Marion with a singular feeling of satisfaction and relief. It is not our present purpose, however, to pursue the route taken by Colonel Tarleton in search of his famous adversary. Such a course does not fall within the purpose of our present narrative. It may be well, however, as it must be sufficient, to say, that, under the guidance of Blonay, he penetrated the spacious swamp of the Santee, and was led faithfully into and through its intricacies—but he penetrated them in vain. Step by step, as the dense body pressed its way through brake, bog, and brier, did they hear the mysterious signals of the watchful partisans, duly communicating to one another the approach of the impending danger. Vainly did Tarleton press forward his advance in the hope of arriving at the camp before these signals could possibly reach it; but such a pathway to his heavily-mounted men was very different in its facilities to those who were accustomed daily to glide through it; and the scouts of Marion hung about Tarleton's advance in front, sometimes venturing in sight, and continually within hearing, to the utter defiance of the infuriated legionary, who saw that nothing could be done to diminish the distance between them. At length they reached the island where the “swamp fox” made his home, but the bird had flown. The couch of rushes where Marion slept was still warm—the fragments of the half-eaten breakfast lay around the logs which formed their rude boards of repast, but not an enemy was to be seen. Stimulating his men by promises and threats, Tarleton still pursued, in the hope to overtake the flying partisans before they could reach the Santee; but in vain were all his efforts; and, though moving with unexampled celerity, he arrived on the banks of the rapid river only in time to behold the last of the boats of the “swamp fox” mingling with the luxurious swamp foliage on the opposite side. The last twenty-four hours had been busily and profitably employed by Marion. He had utterly annihilated the tories who had gathered at Baynton's Meadow. Never, says the history, had surprise been more complete. He came upon the wretches while they played at cards, and dearly did they pay for their temerity and heedlessness. They were shot down in the midst of dice and drink, foul oaths and exultation upon their lips, and with those bitter thoughts of hatred to their countrymen within their hearts which almost justified the utmost severities of that retribution to which the furious partisans subjected them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. Let us now return to Janet Berkeley and the wounded Mellichampe. Tarleton had not deceived the maiden. The hurts of her lover, though serious and painful, were yet not dangerous, unless neglected; and as the privilege was accorded her—the sweetest of all privileges to one who loves truly—of being with and tending upon the beloved one, there was no longer reason to apprehend for his safety from the injuries already received. The apprehensions of Janet Berkeley were, naturally enough, all addressed to the future. She knew the enemy in whose custody he lay; and, though half consoled by the positive assurances of Tarleton, and compelled, from the necessity of the case, to be satisfied, she was yet far from contented with the situation of her lover. His first moment of perfect consciousness, after his wounds had been dressed, found her, a sweet minister, waiting at his side. Her hand bathed his head and smoothed his pillow,—her eye, dewy and bright, hung like a sweet star of promise above his form,—her watchful care brought him the soothing medicine,—her voice of love cheered him into hope with the music of a heaven-born affection. Every whisper from her lips was as so much melody upon his ear, and brought with it a feeling of peace and quiet to his mind, which had not often been a dweller there before. Ah, surely, love is the heart's best medicine! It is the dream of a perfect spirit—the solace of the otherwise denied—the first, the last hope of all not utterly turned away from the higher promptings and better purposes of a divine humanity. How sweet became his hurts to Mellichampe under such attendance! The pain of his wounds and bruises grew into a positive pleasure, as it brought her nigh to him—and so nigh!—as it disclosed to his imagination such a long train of enjoyments in the future, coming from the constant association with her. Love no longer wore her garb of holyday, but, in the rustic and unostentatious dress of home, she looked more lovely to his sight, as she seemed more natural. Hitherto, he had sought her only for sweet smiles and blessing words; now she gave him those cares of the true affection which manifested its sincerity—which met the demand for them unshrinkingly and with pleasure,—and which bore their many tests, not only without complaint or change, but with a positive delight. It was thus that her heart proved its disinterestedness and devotion; and though Mellichampe had never doubted her readiness to bestow so much, he yet never before had imagined the extent of her possession, and of the sweet liberality which kept full pace with her affluence. Until now, he had never realized, in his most reaching thought, how completely he should become a dependant upon her regards for those sweet sympathies, without which life is a barren waste, having the doom of Adam—that of a stern labour—without yielding him any of the flowers of Eden, and certainly withholding all, if denying that most cherished of all its flowers which he brought with him from its garden—the flower of unselfish love. To be able to confide is to be happy in all conditions, however severe; and this present feeling in his heart—the perfect reliance upon her affection—assured and strengthened the warm passion in his own, until every doubt and fear, selfishness and suspicion, were discarded from that region, leaving nothing in their place but that devotedness to the one worthy object which, as it is holy in the sight of Heaven, must be the dearest of all human possessions in the contemplation of man. With returning consciousness, when he discovered how she had been employed, he carried her hand to his lips and kissed it fervently. He felt too much for several minutes to speak to her. When he did, his words were little else than exclamations. “Ah, Janet—my own—my all!—ever nigh to me, as you are ever dear—how can I repay, how respond to, such sweet love? I now feel how very poor—how very dependant—how very destitute I am!” These were almost the first words which he uttered after awakening from a long, deep, and refreshing sleep, into which he had been thrown by an opiate judiciously administered for that object. She had no reply, but, bending down to his pillow, her lips were pressed upon his forehead lightly, while her uplifted finger warned him into silence. He felt a tear—but a single tear, upon his cheek, while her head hung above him; and so far from being destitute, as he had avowed himself before, he now felt how truly rich he was in the possession of such dear regards. “Heaven bless you, my angel,” he continued, “but I must talk to you, unless you will to me. Speak to me,—tell me all,—let me know what has passed. What of Major Singleton and our men?” “They are gone—safe.” “Ah!—that is good. But Witherspoon—what of him?—he was fighting, when I saw him last, with two: they were pressing him hard, and I—I could give him no aid. What of him—is he safe? Tell me; but do not say that harm has befallen him.” “He, too, is safe, dear Ernest; I saw him as he fled.” “Ha! did he leave me, then—and where? I looked not for that from him. Perhaps—it is so—he brought me to you,—did he not?” “He did not, but then he could not, dearest. He was compelled to fly in haste. I saw him while he fled, and the dragoons came fast after him.” He would have put a thousand other questions, and vainly she exhorted him to silence. She was compelled to narrate all she knew, in order to do that which her entreaties, in the great anxiety and impatience of his mind, failed to effect. She told him of the continued fight in the avenue,—of the approach of Tarleton,—and how, when the enemy had gone in pursuit of the flying partisans, she had sought and found him. Of these events he had no recollection. She suppressed, however, all of those matters which related to the second attempt of Barsfield upon his life while he lay prostrate, and of her own interposition, which had saved him; and took especial care to avoid every topic which could stimulate his anger or increase his anxiety. Of the conduct of Tarleton, so unusual and generous, she gave a full account,—an account which gave the hearer quite as much astonishment as pleasure. It certainly presented to his mind's eye a new and much more agreeable feature in the character of that famous, or rather infamous, soldier. So sweet was it for him thus to hear, and so grateful to her to have such a pleased auditor, that the hours flew by imperceptibly, and their mutual dream of love would not soon have been disturbed but for the sounds of Barsfield's voice, which came from the passage-way, while he spoke in harsh dictation to the sentinels who watched the chamber of the wounded Mellichampe. The youth started as the well-known and hated accents met his ears. His brow gathered into a cloud, and he half raised himself from his pillow, while his eye flashed the fire of battle, and his fingers almost violently grasped the wrist of the maiden, under the convulsive spasm of fury which seized upon and shook his enfeebled frame. “That voice is Barsfield's. Said you not, Janet, that I was Colonel Tarleton's prisoner?” She answered him quickly, and with an air of timid apprehension— “I did, dear Ernest; but Colonel Tarleton has gone in pursuit of General Marion—” “And I am here, at the mercy of this bloody wretch —this scoundrel without soul or character,—at his mercy—without strength—unable to lift arm or weapon, and the victim of his will. Ha! this is to be weak—this is to be a prisoner, indeed!” Bitterly and fiercely did he exclaim, as he felt the true destitution of his present condition. “Not at his will—not at his mercy, dear Ernest. Colonel Tarleton has promised me that you shall be safe—that he dare not harm you.” She spoke rapidly in striving to reassure her lover. Her arm encircled his neck—her tears flowed freely upon his cheeks, while her voice, even while it uttered clearly the very words of assurance which Tarleton had expressed, trembled as much with the force of her own secret fears as at the open expression of his. But her lover remained unsatisfied. He did not know the nature of those securities which Barsfield tacitly placed in the hands of his superior. “Alas, Janet, I know this monster but too well not to apprehend the worst at his hands. He is capable of the vilest and the darkest wrongs where he hates and fears. But why should I fear? The power of the base and the tyrannical, thank Heaven! has its limits, and he can but—” “Say not, Ernest—say not. He dare not—he will not. I believe in Colonel Tarleton.” “So do not I; but I fear not, my beloved. I have dared death too often already—I have seen him in too many shapes, to tremble at him now. I fear him not: but to die like a caged rat, cooped in a narrow dungeon, and only preparing myself for the knife of the murderer, is to die doubly; and this, most probably, is the doom reserved for me.” “Think not so—think not so, Ernest—I pray you, think not so. God keep me from the horrible thought! It cannot be that Tarleton will suffer it—it cannot be that God will suffer it. I would not that you should speak so, Ernest; and I cannot think that this bad man —bad enough, though I believe him to be, for any thing —will yet dare so far to incur the danger of offending his superior as to abuse his trust and gratify his malignity in the present instance. Oh, no! he greatly fears Colonel Tarleton; and, could you but have seen the look that Tarleton gave him, as he ordered him to take all care of you,—had you but heard his words to me and to him both,—you would not feel so apprehensive; and then, you know, Colonel Tarleton's own surgeon is left with you, and none are to be permitted to see you but myself and such persons as he thinks proper.” “I fear nothing, Janet, but distrust every thing that belongs to this man Barsfield. Colonel Tarleton, I doubt not, has taken every precaution in my favour, though why he should do so I am at a loss to determine; but all precautions will be unavailing where a man like Barsfield is bent upon crime, and where, in addition to his criminal propensity, he has the habitual cunning of a man accustomed to its indulgence. He will contrive some means to shift the responsibility of the charge, in some moment or other, to other shoulders, and will avail himself of that moment to rid himself of me, if he possibly can. We must only be heedful of all change of circumstances, and seek to apprize Witherspoon of my situation. He will not be far off, I well know; for he must be miserable in my absence.” “Oh, trust me, Ernest, I shall watch you more closely than those sentinels. Love, surely, can watch as well as bate.” Vol. II.—D 7 “Better—better, my Janet. May I deserve your care—your love. May I always do you justice, living or dying.” Her cheek rested upon his, and she wept freely to hear his words. He continued— “I know that you will watch over me, and I chafe not more at my own weakness than at the charge and care that this dreary watch must impose upon you.” “A sweet care—a dear, not a dreary, watch. Oh! Ernest—it is the sweetest of all cares to watch for the good of those we love.” “I feel it sweet to be thus watched, dearest; so sweet that, under other circumstances, I feel that I should not be willing to relieve you of the duty. But you have little strength—little ability, in correspondence even with your will to serve me. This villain will elude your vigilance—he will practise in some way upon you; and oh, my Janet, what if he succeed in his murderous wish—what if—” With a convulsive sob, that spoke the fulness of her heart and its perfect devotion, she threw herself upon his bosom, and her lips responded to his gloomy anticipations while interrupting them. “I am not strong enough to save you, Ernest, and to contend with your murderer, if such he should become; but there is one thing that I am strong enough for.” “What is that, dearest?” “To die for you at any moment.” And, for an hour after, a tearful silence, broken only by an occasional word, which spoke, like a long gathering tear, the overcrowding emotions to which it brought relief, was all the language of those two loving hearts, thus mingling sweetly together amid the strife and the storm—the present evil, the impending danger, and the ever threatening dread. The strife and the hate without brought neither strife nor hate to them; and, like twin forms, mutually devoted to the last, amid the raging seas and on a single spar, they clung to each other, satisfied, though the tempest raged and the waves threatened, to perish, if they might perish together. They were not, in those sad moments, less confident and conscious of the sweets of a mutual love, though filled with anticipations of evil, and though they well knew that a malignant and unforgiving Hate stood watching at the door. And the affection was not less sweet and sacred that it was followed by the thousand doubts and apprehensions which at no moment utterly leave the truly devoted, and which, in the present instance, came crowding upon them with a thousand auxiliar terrors to exaggerate the form of the danger, and to multiply the accumulating stings of fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “How sweet the days of Thalaba went by!” Mellichampe, under such attendance, soon grew insensible to all his sufferings. The bruises quickly disappeared —the wounds were healing rapidly. The care of the nurse surpassed in its happy effects the anticipations of the physician, and the youth was getting well. The spirits of the two became strong and confident with the improvement of the patient: and their hearts grew happier, and their hopes more buoyant, with each day's continued association. The world around them was gradually excluded from their contemplation; and, blessed with the presence of each other, the chamber of Mellichampe—his prison, as it was—closely watched by hostile eyes and guarded by deadly weapons—was large enough for the desires of one, at least, of the two within it. The relation existing between Janet Berkeley and Ernest D 2 Mellichampe appeared now to be understood by all parties. Her father had nothing to oppose—the maiden herself in the perilous moment, as it was thought, to the safety of her lover, had fearlessly and proudly proclaimed the ties existing between them; and, if the prude Decorum could suggest nothing against the frequent and unobstructed meeting of the two, Virtue herself had no reason to apprehend; for, surely, never yet did young hearts so closely and fervently cling to one another— yet so completely maintain the purity and the ascendency of their souls. Love, built upon esteem, is always secure from abasement—it is that passion, falsely named love, which grows out of a warm imagination and wild blood only, which may not be trusted by others, as it is seldom entirely able to trust or to control itself. Rose Duncan complained, however, as she suffered much by the devotion of Janet Berkeley to her lover. This young girl was one of those, thousands of whom are to be met with hourly, who derive all their characteristics from the colour of events and things around them. She had little of that quality, or combination of qualities rather, which we call character. She was of a flexible and susceptible temperament. The hues of her mind came from the passing zephyr, or the over-hanging cloud. She lacked those sterner possessions of intrinsic thought which usually make their proprietor independent of circumstances, and immoveable under the operation of illegitimate influences. Unlike her graver companion, she had no sorrows, simply because she had little earnestness of character. She was usually lively and elastic in the extreme; and he who only casually observed might have imagined that a spirit so cheerful as hers usually appeared would not readily be operated upon or kept down by the occurrence of untoward events. But, if she lacked all of those features of sadness which mellowed and made the loveliness of Janet's character, and softened the quicker emotions of her soul, she was, at the same time, entirely wanting in that concentration of moral object which enables the possessor to address himself firmly and without scruple to the contest of those evils, whether in prospect or in presence, which, nevertheless, even when overcome, make the eye to weep and the soul to tremble. Rose Duncan would laugh at the prediction of evil, simply because she could never concentrate her thoughts sufficiently upon its consideration; and thus, when it came upon her, she would be utterly unprepared to encounter it. Not so with Janet Berkeley. Her heart, gentle and earnest in all its emotions, necessarily inclined her understanding and imagination to think upon and to estimate all those sources of evil, not less than of good, which belong to, and make up, the entire whole of human life. Its sorrows she had prepared herself to endure from the earliest hours of thought; and it was thus that, when sorrow came to her in reality, it was the foregone conclusion to which her reflections had made her familiar, and for which her nerves were already prepared. The tale of suffering brought forth no less grief than the actual experience of it, and far less of that active spirit of resistance and that tenacious soul of endurance with which she was at all times prepared to contend with its positive inflictions. It was thus that she was enabled, when her more volatile companion lay unnerved and terrified at her feet, to go forth fearlessly amid all the danger and the dread, traverse the field of strife unshaken by its horrors, and, from among the dying and the dead, seek out the one object to whom, when she had once pledged her heart, she had also pledged the performance, even of a duty so trying and so sad; and, though she had sickened at the loathsome aspect of war around her, she had felt far less of terror in that one scene of real horrors than she had a thousand times before in the dreams begotten by an active 7* imagination, and a soul earnest, devoted, and susceptible in the extreme. Often did Rose Duncan chide the maiden for her exclusive devotion to her lover, as she herself suffered privation from her devotedness. “There is quite too much of it, Janet; he will be sick to death of you before you are married, if, indeed, you ever are married to him, which ought to be another subject of consideration with you. It would be very awkward if, after all these attentions on your part—this perfect devotion, I may call it—he should never marry you. I should never trust any man so far.” “Not to trust is not to love. When I confide less in Mellichampe, I shall love him less, Rose, and I would not willingly think of such a possibility. In loving him I give up all selfish thoughts: I must love entirely, or not at all.” “Ah, but how much do you risk by this?” “It is woman's risk always, Rose, and I would not desire one privilege which does not properly belong to my sex. I have no qualifications in my regard for Mellichampe. To my mind, his honour is as lofty as, to my heart, his affections are dear. I should weep— I should suffer dreadfully—if I thought, for an instant, that he believed me touched with a single doubt of his fidelity.” “Very right, perhaps, Janet, and you are only the better girl for thinking as you do; but marriage and love are lotteries, they say, and it is no wisdom to stake one's all in a lottery. A little venture may do well enough, but prudent people will be well minded, and keep something in reserve. I like that Scotchman's advice of all things— “ `Aye free aff han' your story tell When wi' a bosom crony, But still keep something to yoursel, You seldom tell to ony. “`Conceal yoursel, as well's ye can, Fra' critical dissection, But keek through every other man Wi' sharpen'd sly inspection.”' “And I think it detestable doctrine, Rose Duncan,” Janet responded, with something like indignation overspreading her beautiful, sad countenance for the instant, as a flash of parting sunlight sent through the deep forests in the last moment of his setting— “I think it detestable doctrine, only becoming in a narrow-minded wretch, who, knavish himself, suspects all mankind of a similar character. Such doctrines are calculated to make monsters of one half of the world and victims of the other. No, no, Rose,—I may be wrong—I may be weak,—I may give my heart fondly and foolishly,—I may train my affections unprofitably,—but, oh, let me confide still, though I suffer for it! Let me never distrust where I love—where I have set my heart—where I have staked all that I live for.” Rose was rebuked, and here, for a few moments, the conversation ended. But there was something still in the bosom of Janet which needed, and at length forced, its utterance:— “And yet, Rose, there is one thing which you have said which pains me greatly. It may be true, that though, in seeking Mellichampe day by day, and hour by hour, I only feel myself more truly devoted to him; it may be that such will not be the feeling with him; it may be that he will, as you say, grow tired of that which he sees so frequently; it may be that he will turn away from me, and weary of my regards. I have heard before this, Rose, that the easy won was but little valued of men,—that the seeker was still unsought,—and that, when the heart of woman was secured, she failed to enchain that of her captor. Oh, Rose, it is death to think so. Did I dream that Mellichampe would slight me,—did I think that he could turn from me with a weary spirit and an indifferent eye, I should pray to perish now—even now, when he speaks to and smiles upon me in such sort as never man spoke to and smiled upon woman whom he could deceive, or whom he did not love.” And her head sank upon the shoulder of her companion, and she sobbed with the fulness of her emotion, as if her heart were indeed breaking. It was long that day—long in her estimate, not less than in that of Mellichampe—before she paid her usual visit to the chamber of her lover. She was then compelled to listen to those reproaches from his lips which her own heart told her were justly uttered. Influenced more than she was willing to admit, even to herself, by the suggestions of Rose Duncan, she had purposely kept away until hour after hour had passed—how drearily to both!—before she took courage to reject the idle restraints of conventional arrangement, which never yet had proper concern with the business of unsophisticated affection. Gently he chid her with that neglect for which she could offer no sort of excuse; but she hid her head in his bosom, and murmured forth the true cause of her delay, as she whispered, in scarce audible accents— “Ah, Ernest, you will tire of me at last,—you will only see too much of me, and I am always so same— so like myself—and have so few changes by which to amuse you, that you will weary of the presence of your poor Janet.” “Foolish fears—foolish fears, Janet, and too unjust to me, and too injurious to us both, to permit me to suffer them longer. It is because you are always the same—always so like yourself, that I love you so well. I am secure, in this proof, against your change. I am secure of your stability, and feel happy to believe that, though all things alter besides, you at least will be inflexible in your continued love for me.” “Ah, be sure of that, Ernest; it is too sweet to love, and too dear to be loved by you, for me to change, lest I should find you change also. I cannot change, I feel, until my very heart shall decay. The seeds of love which have been sown within it were sown by your hands, and they acknowledge you only as the proper owner. Their blight can only follow the blight of the soil in which they are planted, or only perish through—” She paused, and the tears flowed too freely to permit her to conclude the sentence. “Through what, Janet?” he demanded. In a murmuring and low tone she replied, instantly, “Only through the neglect of him who planted them.” He folded her to his heart, and she believed the deep, fond asseveration in which he assured her that no fear was more idle than that which she had just expressed. The shrill tones of the trumpet startled the lovers from their momentary dream of bliss. “That sound,” he said,—“it makes my wound shoot with pain, as if the blood clamoured there for escape. How I hate to hear its notes,—sweet as they are to me when I am on horseback,—here in this dungeon, and denied to move!” An involuntary sigh escaped the maiden as she listened to this language, and it came to her lips to say, though she spoke not— “But you are here with me, in this dungeon, Ernest, and with you I am never conscious of restraint or regret. Alas for me! since I must feel that, while I have no other thought of pleasure but that which comes with your presence, Ernest, your pulse bounds and beats with the desire of a wider world, and of other conquests, even when I, whom you so profess to love beyond all other objects, am here sitting by your side!” The sigh reached the ears of Mellichampe, and his quick sense and conscious thought readily divined the cause of her emotion. D 3 “Wonder not, my Janet,” he exclaimed, as he caught her to his bosom,—“wonder not that I chafe at this restraint, even though blessed with your sympathy and presence. Here I am not less conscious of the tenure by which I hold your presence and my own life, than of the thousand pleasures which your presence brings me. I love not the less because I pine to love in security; and feel not the less happy by your side because I long for the moment to arrive when no power can separate us. Now, are we not at the mercy of a wretch, whom we know to possess no scruples of conscience, and who feels few, if any, of the restraints of power? In his mood, at his caprice, we may be torn asunder, and— but let us speak of other things.” And the conversation turned upon brighter topics. The uttered hopes and the wishes of Mellichampe cheered the heart of the maiden, until, even while the tears of a delicious sensibility were streaming from her eyes, she forgot that hope had its sorrows,—she forgot that love—triumphant and imperial love—has still been ever known as the born victim of vicissitudes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Three days elapsed from the departure of Blonay with Colonel Tarleton before he returned to Piney Grove. Barsfield grew impatient. He had matured his plan in his mind—he had devised the various processes for the accomplishment of his purpose, and he was feverish and restless until he could confer with his chief agent in the business. He came at last, and first brought intelligence to the tory of the failure of the legionary colonel to surprise the wary Marion. “And where now is Colonel Tarleton?” demanded Barsfield. “Gone up after the `game cock.”[1] [1] Colonel Sumter—so styled by Tarleton himself. This was no less the nom de guerre of Sumter, than was the “swamp fox” that of Marion. Both names are singularly characteristic. “I'm glad of it,” said the tory, involuntarily. “He might have been in our way. When did you separate from him?” “Day before yesterday—he went up the river. I went back into the swamp.” “And why? Had not the rebels left it? Did you not say that they crossed the river on the approach of Tarleton?” “Yes—but, adrat it! they crossed back mighty soon after Tarleton had gone out of sight.” “And they are even now in the swamp again?” “Jist as they was at first.” “The devil! And you have seen them there since the departure of Tarleton?” “Reckon I has.” “They are audacious, but we shall rout them soon. My loyalists are coming in rapidly, and I shall soon be able, I trust, to employ you again, and I hope with more success, in ferreting them out. But why did you delay so long to return? Have you seen your enemy?” “Adrat it, yes,” replied the other, coldly, though with some show of mortification. “Where—in the swamp?” “No—on the road here, jist afore dark last night—a leetle more than long rifle shot from the front of the avenue.” “Well?” “'Tworn't well. I tracked him over half a mile afore I could git a shot—” The Half-Breed paused. “What then?” demanded Barsfield, impatiently. “Adrat it! jist as I was guine to pull trigger, a pain, something jist like a hammer-strike, went into my elbow, and the bullet—'twas a chawed one, too—must have gone fur enough from the scull 'twas aimed fur.” “You missed him?” inquired Barsfield. “Reckon I did. He stuck to his critter jist as if nothing had happened strange to him, and rode off in a mighty hurry.” “And how came you to miss him? You hold yourself a good shot.” “'Tain't often I miss; but I felt all over, afore I pulled upon him, that I was guine to miss. Something seemed to tell me so. I was quite too quick, you see, and didn't take time to think where I should lay my bullet.” “Yet you may have hit him. These men of Marion sometimes stick on for hours after they get the death-wound—long enough, certainly, to get away into some d—d swamp or other, where there's no getting at the carcass.” “Adrat it—I'm fear'd I hain't troubled him much. I felt as if I shouldn't hit him. I was so consarned to hit him, you see, that my eye trimbled. But there's no helping it now. There's more chances yet.” “You seek him every day?” inquired Barsfield, curious to learn the habits of a wretch so peculiar in his nature. “And night—a'most every day and night, when I reckon there's a chance to find him.” “But how do you calculate these chances?” “I've got a'most all his tracks. He's a master of the scouts, and as I knows pretty much where they all keeps, I follows him when he goes the rounds.” “Why, then, have you not succeeded better before? Have you not frequently seen him before last night?—did you never get a shot till then?” “Yes, three times—but then he had other sodgers with him—good shots, too, and raal swamp-suckers— sich as John Davis—who's from Goose Creek, and can track a swamp-sucker jist as keen as myself. A single shot must be a sure shot, or 'tain't a safe one. So we always says at Dorchester—and it's reason, too. It wouldn't be no use to shoot one, and be shot by two jist after. There wouldn't be no sense in that.” “No, but little—and yet I shall probably have to take some risk of that sort with my enemy. Do you know, Blonay, that I'm thinking to let Mellichampe run?” “You ain't—sartin now, cappin! Don't you hate him?” “Yes! as bitterly as ever. You wonder that I should so determine towards my enemy. He is still such, and I am his, not less now than ever. But I have been thinking differently of the matter. I will meet him only like a man, and a man of honour. His life is in my hands—I could have him murdered in his bed, but I will not. More than this—my word, as you know, will convict him as a spy upon my camp, and this would hang him upon a public gallows in the streets of Charleston. I will even save him from this doom. I will save him, that we may meet when neither shall have any advantage other than that which his own skill, strength, and courage shall impart. You shall help me, or rather help him, in this.” “How?” was the very natural response of the Half-Breed. “Assist him to escape. Hear me—if he does not escape before the week is out, I am commanded to conduct him to Charleston, to stand his trial as a spy, under charges which I myself must bring forward. He must be convicted, and must perish as I have said, unless he escapes from my custody before. He is too young, and, I may add, too noble, to die in so disgraceful a manner. Besides, that will be robbing me of my own revenge, which I now desire to take with my own hands.” 8 The last suggestion was better understood by the Indian spirit of Blonay than all the rest. The tory captain proceeded— “There are yet other reasons which prompt me to desire his escape—reasons which, though stronger than any of those given, it is not necessary, nor, indeed, would it be advisable, for me to disclose now. It is enough that I save him from a fate no less certain than degrading. You cannot object to give your co-operation in saving the life which you were employed to take.” The Half-Breed did not refuse the new employment thus offered to his hands; but his words were so reluctantly brought forth as clearly to imply a doubt as to whether the one service would be equally grateful with the other. “How!” exclaimed Barsfield; “would you rather destroy than save?” “Adrat it, cappin, it's easier to shoot a man than take a journey.” The tory captain paused for a moment, and surveyed closely the features of the savage. His own glance denoted no less of the fierce spirit which had dictated the answer of the latter, and gladly, at that moment, would he have sent the assassin forward to the chamber of his enemy, in order to the immediate fulfilment of the contemplated crime. But a more prudent, if not a better thought, determined him otherwise. He subdued, as well as he could, the rising emotion. He strove to speak calmly, and, we may add, benevolently, and a less close observer of bad passions and bad men than Blonay might have been deceived by the assumed and hypocritical demeanour of Barsfield. “No, no, Mr. Blonay—it must not be. He is my enemy, but he is honourably such; and as an honourable enemy I am bound to meet him. I must take no advantage of circumstances. He must have fair play, and I must trust then to good limbs, and what little skill I may have in my weapon, to revenge me of my wrongs upon him. You, perhaps, do not comprehend this sort of generosity. Your way is to kill your enemy when you can, and in the most ready manner; and, perhaps, if the mere feeling of hostility were alone to be considered, yours would be as proper a mode as any other. But men who rank high in society must be regulated by its notions. To gratify a feeling is not so important as to gratify it after a particular fashion. We kill an enemy for our own satisfaction; but our seconds have a taste to be consulted, and they provide the weapons, and say when and how we shall strike, and stand by to share the sport.” “Adrat it, but there's no need of them. A dark wood, close on the edge of the swamp, where you can roll the carrion in the bog, and that's all one wants for his enemy after the bullet's once gone through his head.” “So you think, and so, perhaps, you may think rightly; but I move in a different world from you, and am compelled to think differently. I cannot revenge myself after your fashion. I must give my enemy a chance for a fair fight. I must devise a plan for his escape from the guards, and in that, Blonay, I require your assistance.” “Adrat it, cappin, if so be all you want is to let the fellow off, why don't you let him run without any fuss. You don't want my help for that. He'll promise to meet you, I reckon, in any old field, and then you can settle your consarn without more trouble.” “What! and be trussed up by Cornwallis or Tarleton a moment after, as a traitor, upon the highest tree! You seem to forget, Mr. Blonay, that, in doing as you now advise, I must be guilty of a breach of trust, and a disobedience of orders, which are remarkably positive and strict. Your counsel is scarcely agreeable, Blonay, and any thing but wise.” “Adrat it, cappin, won't it be a breach of trust, any how, supposing the chap gits off from prison by my help?” “Not if I can show to my superior that I maintained a proper guard over him, and used every effort for his recapture.” “But how can he git off if you does that?” inquired the seemingly dull Blonay. “I will not do so. I will not maintain a proper guard. I will give you certain opportunities, which shall be known only to yourself, and, at the same time, I shall keep up an appearance of the utmost watchfulness; so that, whatever blame may attach to the proceeding, will fall full, not upon my head, but the sentinel's.” “Adrat it, cappin, I suppose it's all right, as you say. I can't say myself. I don't see, but should like to hear, cappin, what all's to be done.” “Hear me:—the prisoner must be taught that you are his friend—willing, for certain reasons, and for good rewards, to extricate him from his predicament.” “Yes—but how is he to know that? You won't let anybody to see him—nobody but the doctor and the young lady.” “True—but it is through the young lady herself that the matter is to be executed—” “I won't do nothin to hurt the gal, cappin,” exclaimed Blonay, quickly and decisively. “Fool! I ask no service from you which can possibly do her harm. Be not so hasty in your opinions, but hear me out. It is through her that you are to act on him. She has distinguished you with some indulgences —she sent you your breakfast this morning—” “She's a mighty good gal!” said the other, meditatively, and interrupting the now deeply-excited and powerfully-interested Barsfield. “She is,” said the tory, in a tone artfully conciliatory. “She is—and it will both serve and please her to extricate this youth from the difficulties which surround him. He is an object of no small importance in her sight.” “The gal loves him,” still meditatively said the other. “Yes—and you now have an excellent opportunity to offer her your service without being suspected of any wrong. Your are to seek her, and tell her what you have heard respecting the prisoner. Say that he is to be sent to town to stand his trial—that there is no doubt that he will be convicted if he goes, and that his execution will follow as certainly as soon. You can then pledge yourself to save him—to get him out of the camp —to place him safely in the neighbouring woods, beyond my reach and my pursuit. She will, no doubt, close with your offer, and by this act you will serve me quite as much as the prisoner and herself.” To this plan Blonay started sundry little objections, for all of which the tory had duly provided himself with overruling answers. The Half-Breed, simply enough, demanded why Barsfield, proposing, as he did, to render so great a service to the prisoner, should scruple to say to him and to the young lady who watched—both sufficiently interested to keep his secret—what he now so freely said to him? This was soon answered. “They will suspect me of a design to involve the prisoner in some new difficulty, as they have no reason to suppose me desirous of serving either. I have no motive to befriend him—none. But, on the contrary, they know me as his enemy, and believe the worst of me accordingly. You only know why I propose this scheme.” The Half-Breed was silenced, though not convinced. Suspicious by nature and education, he began to conjecture other purposes as prevailing in the mind of his employer; but, for the time, he promised to prepare himself, and to comply with his various requisitions. It was not until he reached the woods, and resumed his position against his tree, that the true policy of the tory captain came out before his mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8* CHAPTER XIII. What were the designs of the tory? “What bloody scene had Roscious now to act?” Could it be that Barsfield was really prompted by a new emotion of generous hostility? Had his feelings undergone a change, and did he really feel an honourable desire, and meditate to save his rival Mellichampe from an ignominious death, only for the self-satisfying vengeance which he promised to himself from the employment of his own weapon? No! These were not the thoughts—not the purposes of the malignant tory. The Half-Breed was not deceived by the gracious and strange shows of newborn benevolence which appeared to prompt him. Had the death of Mellichampe been certain, as the result of his threatened trial, Barsfield would have been content to have obeyed his orders, and to carry the victim to Charleston, for trial and execution. But that fate was not certain. He felt assured, too, that it was not even probable. Cornwallis and Tarleton, both, had shed more blood wantonly already than they could well account or atone for to public indignation. The British House of Commons already began to declaim upon the wanton and brutal excesses which popular indignation had ascribed to the British commanders in America; and the officers of the southern invading armies now half repented of the crimes which, in the moment of exasperation, they had been tempted to commit upon those who, as they were familiarly styled rebels, seemed consequently to have been excluded hitherto from the consideration due to men. There was a pause in that sanguinary mood which had heretofore stimulated Cornwallis, Rawdon, Tarleton, Balfour, and a dozen other petty tyrants of the time and country, to the most atrocious offences against justice and humanity. They began to feel, if not the salutary rebukings of conscience, the more obvious suggestions of fear; for, exasperated to madness by the reckless want of consideration shown to their brethren in arms when becoming captives to the foe, the officers of the southern American forces, banded and scattered, pledged themselves solemnly in writing to retaliate in like manner, man for man, upon such British officers as should fall into their hands; thus voluntarily offering themselves to a liability, the heavy responsibilities of which sufficiently guarantied their sincerity. To the adoption of this course they also required a like pledge from the commander-in-chief; and General Greene was compelled to acquiesce in their requisition. The earnest character of these proceedings, known as they were to the enemy, had its effect; and the rebukes of conscience were more respected when coupled with the suggestions of fear. Barsfield knew that the present temper of his superiors was not favourable to the execution of Mellichampe. He also felt that his own testimony against the youth must be unsatisfactory, if met by that of Mr. Berkeley and his daughter. He dreaded that Mellichampe should reach Charleston, though as a prisoner, and become known in person to any of the existing powers, as he well knew the uncertain tenure by which the possessions were secured which had been alloted to him in a moment of especial favour by the capricious generosity of the British commander. Guilt, in this way, for ever anticipates and fears the thousand influences which it raises up against itself; and never ceases to labour in providing against events, which for a long time it may baffle, but which, in the moment of greatest security, must concentrate themselves against all its feeble barriers, and overthrow them with a breath. Barsfield had also his personal hostility to gratify, and of this he might be deprived if his prisoner reached the city in safety. His present design was deeply laid, therefore, in order that he might not be defrauded. Janet Berkeley was to be the instrument by which Mellichampe was to be taught to apprehend for his life, as a convicted spy under a military sentence. The ignominious nature of such a doom would, he was well aware, prompt the youth to seize upon any and every chance to escape from custody. This opportunity was to be given him, in part. The guards were to be so placed as at the given moment to leave the passage from his chamber free. The road was to be cleared for him at a designated point, and this road, under the guidance of Blonay, the youth was to pursue. But it was no part of Barsfield's design to suffer his escape. An ambush was to be laid for the reception of the fugitive, and here the escaping prisoner was to be shot down without a question; and, as he was an escaping prisoner, such a fate, Barsfield well knew, might be inflicted with the most perfect impunity. The cruel scheme was closely treasured in his mind, and only such portions of his plan, as might seem noble without the rest, were permitted to appear to the obtuse sense of the Half-Breed, who was destined to perish at the same moment with the prisoner he was employed to set free. Long and closely did the two debate together on the particular steps to be taken for carrying the scheme of the tory into execution; and it was arranged that, while he, Barsfield, should, in the progress of the same day, apprize Janet of the contemplated removal of Mellichampe to the city for his trial, Blonay should mature his plan for approaching the maiden on a subject in which, to succeed at all, it was necessary that the utmost delicacy of address should be observed. The Half-Breed was to assume a new character. He was to appear before her with an avowal of sympathy which seemed rather a mockery, coming from one so incapable and low. He was to make a profession of regard for her, and for him whom she regarded, and thus obtain her confidence, without which he could do nothing. Barsfield did not believe it possible for such a creature to feel, and his only fear was that the task would be too novel and too difficult for him to perform decently and with success. But the tory was mistaken in his man. He did not sufficiently dive into the nature of the seemingly obdurate wretch before him; and he had not the most distant idea of the occult and mysterious causes of sympathy for the maiden which were at work in the breast of the savage, whom he loathed even while employing, and for whom he meditated the same doom of death, at the same time, which his hands were preparing for Mellichampe. But Blonay saw through his intentions; and, confident that the plan was designed for the murder of Mellichampe, he suspected, at the same time, the design upon himself. “He won't want me after that,” he muttered to himself, as soon as he got into the woods; and he chuckled strangely and bitterly as he thought over the affair. In the woods he could think freely, and he soon conceived the entire plan of his employer. He determined accordingly. He was a tactician, and knew how much was to be made out of the opinion entertained by Barsfield of his stolidity. He was an adept at that art which governs men by sometimes adopting, seemingly, their own standards of judgment. He went instantly back to the tory, and, drawing from his purse the sum of five guineas which the other had given while engaging him, he spoke thus, while returning it:— “I reckon, cappin, you'd better git somebody else to do your business for you in this 'ere matter. I can't.” “Can't! why?” responded Barsfield, in astonishment. “Well, you see, cappin—I've been thinking over the business, and, you see, I can't see it to the bottom. I don't understand it.” “And what then? Why should you understand it? You have only to do what is told you. I understand it, and that's enough, I imagine.” “I reckon not, cappin—axing your pardon. I never meddles with business I don't understand. If so be you says, `Go to the chap's room, and put your knife in him,' I'll do that for the money; but I can't think of the other business. I don't see to the bottom,—it's all up and down, and quite a confusion to me.” The proposal to murder Mellichampe off-hand for the five guineas would have been accepted instantly, were it the policy of Barsfield to have it done after that fashion; but he dared not close with the tempting offer. The willingness of Blonay, however, to commit the act, had the effect upon Barsfield's mind which the Half-Breed desired. It induced a degree of confidence in him which the tory was previously disposed to withhold. He now sought to test his agent a little more closely. “And you will go now to his room and put him to death for the same money?” “Say the word, cappin,” was the ready response, uttered with the composure of one whose mind is made up to the performance of the deed. The tory paused— he dared not comply. “And why not help in getting him clear? Where's the difference?” “'Cause I can't see what you want to clear him for, when you want to kill him, and when you knows he's guine to be hung. I can't see.” “Never mind: it is my desire,—is not that enough? I choose it,—it is my notion. I will pay you for my notion. Do what I have said,—here are five guineas more. Go to Miss Berkeley, and tell her what I have taught you.” The Half-Breed hesitated, or seemed to hesitate. The bright gold glittered in his eye, and he was not accustomed to withstand temptation. His habit almost overcame his reflection, and the determined conviction of his mind; but he resisted the suggestion, and adhered to his resolve. “I'd rather not, cappin; I reckon I can't. If you says now that you wants to kill him, I'll help you, 'cause then I understands you; but to git him out, and let him run free, jist when there's no need for it, and when you hates him all over, is too strange to me—I can't see to the bottom.” “And you will not do as you have said?” demanded the other, with some vexation in his tone and countenance. “Well, now, cappin, why not speak out the plain thing as it is,” said the Half-Breed, boldly; “don't I see how 'tis? When you gits him out, you'll put it to him,—that's what I understands. If it's so, say so, and I'll go the death for you; but I ain't guine to sarve a man that won't let me know the business I'm guine upon. Let me see your hand, and I'll say if I back you.” This was bringing the matter home, and Barsfield at once saw that there was no hope for the aid of the Half-Breed but in full confidence. He made a merit of necessity. “I have only sought to try you. I wished to know how far you were willing and sagacious enough to serve me. I am satisfied. You are right. The boy shall not escape me, though I let him run. You hear me,—can I now depend on you?” “It's a bargain, cappin,” and the savage received the guineas, which were soon put out of sight,—“it's a bargain: say how, when, and where, and there's no more fuss.” They closed hands upon the contract, and Barsfield now unfolded his designs with more confidence. It was arranged that Blonay should carry out the original plan, so far as to communicating with Janet. Her acquiescence following, Mellichampe was to be led, at a particular hour, on a specified night, through a path in which the myrmidons of the tory were to stand prepared; and nothing now remained—so Barsfield thought—in the way of his successful effort at revenge, but to obtain the ministry of the devoted maiden in promoting the scheme which was to terminate in the murder of her lover. Barsfield, in the part prosecution of his design, that very evening sought a private conference with Janet Berkeley, which was not denied him. “What!” exclaimed Rose Duncan, as she heard of the application and of her cousin's compliance,—“what! you consent,—you will see him alone? Surely, Janet, you will not?” “Why not, Rose?” was the quiet answer. “Why not!—and you hate him so, Janet?” “You mistake me, Rose. I fear Mr. Barsfield,— I dread what he may do; but, believe me, I do not hate him. I should not fear him even, did I not know that he hates those whom I love.” “But, whether you hate or fear, why should you see him? What can he seek you for but to make his sickening protestations and professions over and over again? and I don't see that civility requires that you should hear him over and over again, upon such a subject, whenever he takes it into his head to address you.” “It will be time enough to declare my aversion, Rose, when I know that such is his subject. To anticipate now would be not only premature, but in very doubtful propriety, and surely in a taste somewhat indelicate. Such, indeed, can scarcely be the subject on which he would speak with me, for I have already answered him so decisively that he must know it to be idle.” “Ah, but these men never take an answer: they are pertinacious to the last degree; and they all assume, with a monstrous self-complaisance, that a woman does not mean `no' when she says it. Be assured Barsfield will have little else to say. His speech will be all about hearts and darts, and hopes and fears, and all such silly stuff as your sentimentalists deal in. He will tell you about Kaddipah, and promise to make you its queen, and you will tire to death of the struggles of the great bear in an element so foreign to his nature as that of love.” And, while she spoke, the lively girl put herself in posture, and adopted the grin and the grimace, the desperate action and affected enthusiasm, which might be supposed to belong to the address of Barsfield in the part of a lover. Janet smiled sorrowfully as she replied— “Ah, Rose, I would the matter upon which Barsfield seeks me were not more serious than your thoughts assume it to be. But I cannot think with you. I am troubled with a presentiment of evil; I fear me that some new mischief is designed.” “Oh, you are always anticipating evil; you are always on the look-out for clouds and storm.” “I do not shrink from them, Rose, when they come,” said the other, gently. “No, no! you are brave enough: would I were half so valiant, sweet cousin of mine! But, Janet, if you dread that Barsfield has some new mischief afoot, that is another reason why you should not see him. Be advised, dear Janet, and do not go.” “I must, Rose, and I will, for that very reason. I will look the danger in the face; I will not blind myself to its coming. No! let the bolt be shot—let the wo come—let the worst happen, rather than that I should for ever dream, and for ever dread, the worst. Suffering is one part of life—it may be the greatest part of mine. I must not shrink from what I was designed Vol. II.—E 9 to meet; and God give me strength to meet it as I should, and cheer me to bear up against it with a calm fortitude. I feel that this man is the bringer of evil tidings: I am impressed with a fear which almost persuades me to refuse him this meeting. But, as I know this feeling to be a fear, and at variance with my duty to myself not less than to Mellichampe, I will not refuse him. I will go; I will hear what he would say.” “And here I must remain, stuck up like a painted image, to listen to Lieutenant Clayton's rose-water compliments. The man is so bandboxy—so excruciatingly tidy and trim in every thing he says—so measured and musical—and laughs with such continual desperation— that he sickens me to death to entertain him.” “Yet you do entertain him, Rose?” “How can I help it? You will not; and the man looks as if he came for an entertainment.” “And you never disappoint him, Rose.” “'Twould be too cruel that, Janet, for you neither look nor say any thing towards it. You might as well be the old Dutch Venus, stuck up in the corner, whose fat cheeks and small eyes used to give your grandfather such an extensive subject for eulogy. You leave all the task of keeping up the racket, and should not wonder if I seek, as well as in me lies, to maintain your guests in good-humour with themselves, at least.” “And with you. You certainly succeed, Rose, in both objects. Task or not, you are not displeased with the labour of entertaining Lieutenant Clayton, if I judge not very erroneously of your eyes and features generally. And then your laugh, too, Rose—don't speak of the lieutenant's—your laugh is, of all laughs, the most truly natural when you hearken to his good sayings.” “Janet, you are getting to be quite censorious. I am shocked at you. Really, you ought to know that, to entertain a body—if you set out with that intention— you are not to allow it to be seen that you are making an effort. To please others, the first rule is always to seem pleased yourself.” “True—you not only seem pleased yourself, but, Rose, do you know, I really think you are so. You laugh as—” “Pshaw, Janet—pshaw!—I laugh at the man, and not with him.” “I fear me, now I think of it, Rose, that he has discovered that. Methinks he laughs much less of late than ever: he looks very serious at times.” “Do you really think so, Janet?” “I do, really.” “What can be the cause, I wonder?” “Perhaps he has been ordered to join Cornwallis. He spoke of some such matter, you remember, but a week ago.” “Yes, I remember; and at the time, if you recollect, Janet, he looked rather grave while stating it, though he laughed afterward: and yet the laugh did not seem altogether so natural; there was something exceedingly constrained and artificial in it.” “It must be so,” replied Janet, as it were abstractedly. The momentary humour which had prompted her to annoy her thoughtless companion had passed away in the sterner consideration which belonged to her own difficulties. She turned away to a neighbouring window, and looked forth upon the grove, and a little beyond, where, on the edge of the forest, lay the encampment of Barsfield, a glance at which involuntarily drove her away from the window. When her eyes were again turned upon Rose Duncan, she saw that the usually lighthearted girl was still seated, in unwonted silence, with her face buried in her hands. The whole air of the damsel was full of unusual thought and abstraction, and Janet might have seen that a change had come over the spirit of her dream also, but that her E 2 fancy was saddened by the strong and besetting fears which promised her a new form of trial in the meeting with the tory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. That evening, as she had promised, Janet Berkeley indulged Captain Barsfield with the interview which he desired; and while Rose Duncan was left to the task, pleasant or otherwise, of entertaining the sentimental yet laughter-loving lieutenant, the graver maiden, in an adjoining apartment, was held to the severer trial of maintaining the uniform complaisance of the lady and the courteous consideration of the hostess, while listening to one whose every movement she distrusted, and whose whole bearing towards her and hers had been positively injurious, if not always hostile. Barsfield, too, though moved by contradictory feelings, was compelled to subject them all beneath the easy deportment and conciliatory demeanour of a gentleman in the presence of one of the other sex. He rose to meet her upon her entrance, and conducted her to a chair. A few moments elapsed before he spoke, and his words were then brought forth with the difficulty of one who is somewhat at a loss where to begin. At length, as if ashamed of his weakness, he commenced without preliminaries upon the immediate subject which had prompted the desire for the interview. “My surgeon tells me, Miss Berkeley, that his patient—yours, I should rather say—Mr. Mellichampe, will soon be able to undergo removal.” “Removal! sir,” was the momentary exclamation of Janet, with a show of pain not less than of surprise in her ingenuous countenance. “My orders are to remove him to the city, as soon as the surgeon shall pronounce him in a fit condition to bear with the fatigue. He tells me that such will soon be the case. Mr. Mellichampe now walks his chamber, I understand, and is in every respect rapidly recovering from his hurts.” “He is certainly better than he was, Captain Barsfield; but he is yet very, very feeble—too feeble quite to bear with the fatigues of such a journey.” “You underrate the strength of the young gentleman, Miss Berkeley. He is a well-knit, hardy soldier for one so youthful, and will suffer less than you imagine. I trust that my surgeon does not report incorrectly when he states that, in all probability, it will be quite safe to remove him at the commencement of the ensuing week.” “So soon!” was the unaffected, the almost unconscious exclamation. “It is painful to me to deprive you, Miss Berkeley, of any pleasure—of one, too, the loss of which, even in anticipation, seems to convey so much anxiety and sorrow; but the duties of the soldier are imperative.” “I would not wish, sir, to interfere with yours, whatever my own wishes may be, Captain Barsfield,” replied the maiden, with a degree of dignity which seemed provoked into loftiness by the air of sarcasm pervading the previous speech of the tory. “It is for you, sir,” she continued, “to do your duty, if you so esteem it, without reference to the weaknesses of a woman, and, least of all, of mine.” “You mistake, Miss Berkeley—you mistake your own worth, not less than my feelings and present objects. Your weaknesses, if it so pleases you to call them, are sacred in my sight; and, though my duty as a soldier prompts me to take the course with the prisoner which I have already made known to you, such is my regard to your wishes, and for you, that I am not 9* unwilling, in some particulars, to depart from that course with the desire to oblige you.” The maiden looked up inquiringly. “How am I to understand this, Captain Barsfield?” “Oh, Miss Berkeley, there needs no long explanation. If Mellichampe has loved you, you have been no less beloved by me. I cannot now deceive myself on the subject of your regards. I am not so self-blinded as to mistake your feelings for him.” “Nor I to deny them, Mr. Barsfield. There was a time, sir, when I should have shrunk, as from death, from such an avowal as this. It is now my pride, my boast —now that he is deserted by friends, and in the hands of enemies—” “In your hands, Miss Berkeley,” he said, interrupting her. “How, sir?” “In no other hands than yours. Let me show you this. He is not in the hands of enemies, only as you so decree it.” “Proceed, sir, proceed,” she said, impatiently, seeing that he paused in his utterance. “A few words from you, Miss Berkeley, and, such is your power over me, such my regard for you, that, though Mellichampe be my deadly enemy—one who has sought my life, and one whose life my own sense of self-preservation prompts me with like perseverance equally to seek, I am yet willing, in the face of my pledges, my interest, my duty, to connive at his release from this most unpleasant custody. I am willing to place the key of his prison door in your hands, and to give the signal myself when he shall fly in safety.” “You speak fairly, sir—very fairly—very nobly, indeed, if you have spoken all that you design—all that you mean. But is it your regard for me alone that prompts these sentiments—are there no conditions which you deem of value to yourself? Let me hear all—all that you have in reserve, Captain Barsfield, for you will pardon me if, hitherto, I have not esteemed you one to forfeit your pledges, your interest, your duty, to serve, without conditions, a poor maiden like myself.” The cheek of the tory grew to a deep crimson as he spoke, and his words were crowded and uttered chokingly when he replied, “I am not now to learn for the first time, that, influenced as she has been by the speech of others, unfriendly and malignant, the opinions of Miss Berkeley have done me at all times less than justice. The words of old Max Mellichampe, the father of this boy, were thus hostile ever: and they have not been poured into unwilling ears, having you for an auditor, Miss Berkeley. And yet—I had thought that one so gentle as yourself would have shrunk from the language of hatred and denunciation, and been the last so keenly to treasure up its remembrance.” “Can Captain Barsfield wonder that I should remember the opinions of Colonel Mellichampe with reference to himself, when after circumstances have so completely confirmed their justice? Is not Captain Barsfield an active and bloody enemy to the people of his own land—fighting against them under the banner of the invader—and proving himself most bloody and hostile to those with whom he once dwelt, and by whose indulgence, as I have heard, his own infancy was nurtured? Can I forget, too, that by his own hands the brave old colonel perished in a most unequal fight?” “But still a fair one, Miss Berkeley—still a fair fight, and one of his own seeking. But what you have just said, Miss Berkeley, gives me a good occasion to set you right on some matters, and to unfold to you the truth in all. The taking arms under the flag of England, which you style that of the invader, and the death of Colonel Max Mellichampe, form but a single page of the same drama. They are as closely related, Miss Berkeley, as cause and effect, since it was Max Mellichampe that made me—why should I blush to say it? —a tory, in arms against my countrymen:—and to that enrolment — fatal enrolment!—for even now I curse the day on which it was recorded, and him no less that moved it—he owes, and justly owes, his own defeat and death.” “I believe it not, sir. Colonel Mellichampe move you to become a tory—to lift the sword against your people? Never—never!” “Hear me out, and you will believe—you cannot else. He did not move me—did not argue with me to become a tory—oh, no! He forced me to become one. Would you hear?” “Speak on.” “When this cruel and unnatural war commenced in South Carolina, I had taken no part on either side. The violence of the whigs around me, Colonel Mellichampe among them, and the most active among them, towards all those not thinking with themselves, revolted my feelings and my pride, if it did not offend my principles. I was indignant that, while insisting upon all the rights of free judgment for themselves, they should at the same time deny a like liberty to others. And yet they raved constantly of liberty. It was, in their mouths, a perpetual word—and with them it signified every thing and nothing. It was to give them a free charter for any and every practice, and it was to deprive all others of every right, natural and acquired. I dared to disagree—I dared to think differently, and to speak my opinions aloud, though I lifted no weapon, as yet, to sustain them. Was I then a criminal, Miss Berkeley? Was it toryism to think according to my understanding, and to speak the opinions which I honestly entertained? Do me justice and say, so far, I had transgressed no law, either of morals or of the land.” “Do not appeal to me, Captain Barsfield; I am but a poor judge of such matters.” “If you have not judged, Miss Berkeley, you, at least, have sentenced upon the authority of others; and it is your sentence, and their authority, that I seek now to overthrow.” “Go on, sir; I would not do you injustice, and I would rejoice to think that you could relieve yourself from the unfavourable opinions even of one so humble as myself. But I fear me you will fail, sir.” “I hope not, at least, Miss Berkeley; and the fear that you have uttered encourages and strengthens my hope. I now proceed with my narrative. I had, as I have told you, my own opinions, and this was presumption in the eyes of a dictatorial, proud man like Max Mellichampe. I uttered them, and loudly too, and this was the error of one so weak, so wanting in public influence and wealth as myself. Would you hear how this monstrous error was punished?—this part of the story, perhaps, has never reached your ears.” “Punished, sir!” replied the maiden, with some show of astonishment in her countenance,—“what punishment? I had not heard of any punishment.” “I thought not,—the punishment was too light—too trivial—too utterly disproportioned to the offence, to make a part of the narrative. But I was punished, Miss Berkeley, and, for a crime so monstrous as that of thinking differently from my neighbour, even you will doubtlessly conceive the penalty a slight one.” He paused; bitter emotions seemed to gather in his bosom, and he turned away hastily, and strode to the opposite end of the room. In another moment he returned. “You have heard of my offence—you should know how it was dealt with—not by strangers, not by enemies—but by those with whom I had lived—by whose indulgence I had been nurtured. Would you hear, Miss Berkeley?” E 3 “Go on, sir.” “Hear me, then. My neighbours came to me at midnight—not as neighbours, but armed, and painted, and howling—at midnight. They broke into my dwelling—a small exercise of their newly-gotten liberty;— they tore me from the bed where I was sleeping;—they dragged me into the highway, amid a crowd of my brethren—my countrymen—all cheering, and most of them assisting in the work of punishment.” “They surely did not this?” was her exclamation. “They surely did!—but this was not all. An offence so horrible as mine—free thinking in a free country— was yet to have its punishment. What was that punishment, do you think, Miss Berkeley?” His eyes glared upon her with a ghastly stare as he put this question, from which her own shrank involuntarily as she replied— “I cannot think,—I know not.” “They bound me to a tree—fast—immoveable. I could only see their proceedings, I could only endure their tortures,—I could stir neither hand nor foot to resist them—” He shivered, as with a convulsion, while recalling these memories, though the sympathizing and pitying expression of her face brought, a moment after, a smile into his own. He continued— “There, bound hand and foot—a victim—at their mercy, and hopeless of any plea, and incapable of any effort to avoid their judgment, I bore its tortures. You will ask, what more?—” He paused, but she spoke not, and he went on almost instantly— “The lash—the scourge!—rods from the neighbouring woods were brought, and I suffered until I fainted under their blows.” She clasped her hands, and closed her eyes, as if the horrible spectacle were before her. “I came to life to suffer new tortures. They poured the seething tar over me—” “Horrible!—horrible!” “Then, hurrying me to the neighbouring river—your own Santee,—they plunged me into its bosom, and more than once, more merciful than the waters, which did not ingulf me, they thrust me back into their depths, when with feeble struggles I had gained the banks. I was saved by one—more tender than the rest—and left at midnight, exhausted, by the river's side, despairing of life and imploring death, which yet came not to my relief.” “Dreadful—dreadful!” exclaimed the maiden, with emotions of uncontrolled horror, while her ghastly cheeks and streaming eyes attested the deep pain which the cruel narrative had imparted to her soul. Quivering in every limb with the agonizing recollection which his own horrible narrative had awakened in his mind, Barsfield strode the floor to and fro, his hands clinched in his hair, and his eyes almost starting from their sockets. In another moment Janet, recovering herself, with something of desperation in her manner, hurried and breathless, thus addressed him:— “But the father of Ernest Mellichampe—he was not one of these men?—he had no part in this dreadful crime? You have not said that, Mr. Barsfield?” “No!” was his bitter and almost fierce exclamation. “Thank God!—thank God!” she exclaimed, breathlessly. He rapidly crossed the floor,—he approached her, and his finger rested upon her arm— “Stay!” he exclaimed,—“be not too fast. The father of your—of Ernest Mellichampe, did, indeed, lift no hand—he was not even present on the occasion,— but he was not the less guilty—the deed was not the less executed by him.” “How!—speak!” “He was the most guilty. The mere instruments of the crime—the miserable, and howling, and servile wretches, who would have maimed and mangled a creature formed in their own, not less than in the image of God—were not the criminals; but he who set them on —he whose daily language was that of malignant scorn and hostility,—he was its author,—he was the doer of the deed, and to him I looked for vengeance.” “But how know you that he set them on? Did you hear?” “Oh, Miss Berkeley, I say not that he told them, `Go, now, and do this deed;' I know not that he did; but had not Max Mellichampe pronounced me deserving of Lynching,—had he not said that I was a tory, and that tar and feathers were the proper desert of the tory, —had he not approved of those tortures, and of others which degrade humanity—the torture of the rail—the suffocation of the horse-pond,—would these wretches, think you, who take their colour and their thoughts always from the superior,—would they have been prompted, by their own thoughts, to such a crime? No!— they were prompted by him. He approved the deed— he smiled upon its atrocities—and he perished in consequence. Hence my hate to him and his, and it is the hatred of justice which pursues even to the third and fourth generations; for crimes and their penalties, like diseases, are entailed to son and to son's son,—all guilty, and all doomed, alike. Hence it is, that I am a tory. Hence it is, that I lift the sword, unsparingly to the last, against the wretches who taught me in that night of terror—of blistering agony—of manhood's shame —and a suffering worse infinitely than death—of what nature was that boon of liberty which they promised, and which it was in the power of such monsters to bestow. Can you wonder now, Miss Berkeley—not that I am what I am—but that I am not worse? You cannot. I were either more or less than human to be other than I am. Whether these things may excuse my conduct, I do not now ask: all that I may claim from you is, that you will, at least, spare your sarcasms in future upon what you are pleased to call the unnatural warfare which I wage against my countrymen.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. The maiden was indeed silenced. If she did not sympathize entirely with Barsfield, she at least saw what a natural course had been his, under the dreadful indignities which he had been made to suffer. She now looked on him with a feeling of pain and mortification as he paced the apartment to and fro; and her eyes more than once filled with tears, as she thought how far guilty in this transaction had been the father of her lover. At length the tory captain turned to her once more. His countenance had recovered something of its serenity— though the cheek was yet unusually flushed, and when he spoke there was a convulsive unevenness in his accent, which denoted the yet unsubdued emotions of his heart. Still, with a moral power which he certainly possessed, however erringly applied, he subdued the feverish impulse; and, after the pause of a few moments, which the excited and wounded feelings of Janet did not suffer her to interrupt, he proceeded to a more full development of his purpose and his desire. “I have said to you, Miss Berkeley, that I am commanded, so soon as the condition of my prisoner will permit, to convey him to the city. Are you aware with what purpose?—have you any notion of his probable destiny?” The manner of the question alarmed the maiden much 10 more than the question itself. It was grave and mysteriously emphatic. His face wore all the expression of one conscious of the possession of a secret, the utterance of which is to produce the most trying emotions in the hearer, and which the possessor, at the same time, however, does not yet dare to withhold. Janet was silent for a few seconds while gazing into the countenance of the speaker, as if seeking to gather from his glance what she yet trembled to demand from his lips; but remembering the solemn decision of her thoughts when she granted the interview, to seek to know the worst that her enemy could inflict, she recovered and controlled her energies. With a firm voice, therefore, unfaltering in a single accent, she requested him to proceed. “I am not strong—not wise, Captain Barsfield, and I am not able to say what my thoughts are now, or what my feelings may be when I hear what you have to unfold. But God, I trust, will give me strength to endure well, if I may not achieve much. Your looks and manner, more than your words, would seem to imply something which is dangerous to me and mine. Speak it out boldly, Captain Barsfield—better to hear the worst than to imagine error, and find worse in wrong imaginings. I am willing to hear all that you would say, and I beg that you would say it freely, without hesitation.” “I am glad that you are thus strong—thus prepared, Miss Berkeley; for it pains me to think how deeply must be your sorrow and suffering when you learn the truth.” He paused, and with a hypocritical expression of sympathetic wo in his countenance, approached her when he had done speaking. His hand was even extended with a condoling manner, as if to possess itself of hers; but she drew herself up reservedly in her chair, and he halted before her. Her words promptly followed the action— “I am neither strong to endure much, nor prepared to hear any particular cause of sorrow, as I can think of none in particular. Speak it, however, Captain Barsfield, since, whether strong or prepared, I am at least desirous to know all which may concern my feelings in the matter which you have to communicate.” “You will think me precipitate in my communication when you have heard it; and that you have not thought of it hitherto, leads me to apprehend that you will even feel it more forcibly than I had imagined. I deem it doubly important, then, to bid you prepare for a serious evil.” These preparatory suggestions, as they were designed to do, necessarily stimulated still farther the anxieties and apprehensions of the hearer, though she strove nobly, and well succeeded, in mastering her emotions. “Speak—speak—I pray you, sir,” she cried, almost breathless. “Do you know, then, Miss Berkeley, with what object I am required to convey Mr. Mellichampe to the city?” “No, sir—object—what object—none in particular. He is your prisoner—you convey him to prison,” was the hurried reply. “I do—I carry him to prison, indeed—but I also carry him to trial.” “To trial!” “To trial as a spy.” “A spy!—and what then?” “He will be convicted.” “Impossible! he is no spy—who will dare to utter such a falsehood?” “I will dare to utter such a truth. I will accuse—I have accused him. I will prove my accusation; and you, Miss Berkeley, can assist me in establishing the proof. I could rest the entire proof upon your testimony.” “Never—never! God help me, what audacity is this! I scorn your assertion—I despise—I fear nothing of your threats. I know better, and am not to be terrified by a tale so idle as this.” “It is no idle tale, Miss Berkeley, and you are terrified, as you must feel conscious of its truth. You know it to be true.” “I know it to be false!—false as—Heaven forgive me, but this insolence also makes me mad. But I have done now, and you too, sir, have done, I trust. I am not to be frightened by such stories as these; for, know, sir, that when this strange tale was uttered by you before, I had the assurance of Colonel Tarleton—your superior, sir—that there was nothing in it, and that I must not suffer myself to be alarmed. Colonel Tarleton's words, sir, are remembered—he would not give them idly, and I believe in him. He will be there to see justice done to Mellichampe, and with his pledge, sir, I defy your malice. I, too, will go to the city—though I tread every step of the way on foot—I will see Colonel Tarleton, and he will protect the man whom you hate—but whom you dare not fairly encounter—from your dishonourable malice.” “That I dare meet him, Miss Berkeley, his present situation attests—it was by my arm that he was stricken down in fair conflict—” “I believe it not—you dared not. Your myrmidons beset him, while you looked on. It was many to one; —but of this I think not. It is enough that I am required to speak with one, and to look upon one, who has sought to destroy him, and me in him. It is enough— I would hear no more. I believe not in this trial—Colonel Tarleton will not suffer it, and I will go to him. He will see justice.” “He will,” said Barsfield, coolly, in reply to the passionate and unlooked-for vehemence of the maiden—so unlike her usual calm gravity of deportment. “Colonel Tarleton will do justice, Miss Berkeley— it is my hope that he will do so. I have his words for it, indeed, and it is from him the orders come which call for the trial of the prisoner.” “The orders—Colonel Tarleton!” were the simple exclamations of the maiden, as she listened to the assertion. Barsfield calmly drew the paper from his pocket, and placed it in her hands. As she read, the letters swam before her eyes; and, when she had finished, the document fell from her nerveless fingers, and she stood like a dumb imbodiment of wo, gazing with utter vacancy upon her companion. There were the orders, plainly and unequivocally written by Tarleton, as Barsfield had said. Not a word wanting—not a sentence doubtful in its import. Tarleton, who had promised her that her lover was secure, or had led her, by his language and general manner, to believe so, had commanded his trial. Recalling all her energies, with eyes that never once were removed from the countenance of Barsfield, she again took the paper from his hands, as he was lifting it from the floor, and once more read it carefully over—counting the words—almost spelling them—in the hope to find some little evasion of the first meaning— some loop-hole for escape—some solitary bough upon which a found hope might perch and rest itself. But in vain. The letter was a stern and business-like one. “You must convey the prisoner, Mellichampe,” so ran that portion of it which concerned the maiden, “so soon as his wounds will permit, under a strong guard, to the city, where a court of officers will be designated for his trial as a spy upon your encampment. You will spare no effort to secure all the evidence necessary to his conviction, and will yourself attend to the preferment of the charges.” And there, after the details of other matters and duties to be attended to and executed, was the signature of the bloody dragoon, which she more than once had seen before— “B. Tarleton, “Lt. Col. Legion.” 10* She closed her eyes, gave back the paper, and clasped her hands in prayer to Heaven, as the last reliance of earth seemed to be taken away. She had so confidently rested upon the personal assurances of Tarleton, that she had almost dismissed entirely from her thought the charge in question; and which Barsfield had originally made when the legionary colonel was at “Piney Grove.” Now, when she read these orders, she wondered at herself for so implicitly confiding in the assurances of one so habitually distrusted by the Americans, and so notoriously fond of bloodshed. Yet, why had he deemed it necessary to give these assurances to a poor maiden—one not a party to the war, and to whom he could have no cause of hostility. Why practise thus upon an innocent heart and a young affection? Could he be so wanton—so merciless—so fond of all forms of cruelty? These thoughts—these doubts, all filled the brain of the maiden, confusedly and actively, during the brief moments in which she stood silently in the presence of Barsfield, after having possessed herself of the orders with regard to Mellichampe. Her fears had almost stupified her, and it was only the voice of the tory which seemed to arouse her to a full consciousness, not less of the predicament in which her lover stood, than of the presence of his enemy. She raised her eyes, and, without a word, listened anew to the suggestions of Barsfield; who, speaking, as he did, ungrateful and unpleasant things, had assumed his most pleasant tones, and put on a deportment the most courteous and respectful. “You doubt not now, Miss Berkeley?—the facts are unquestionable. These are direct and positive orders, and must be obeyed. In a few days Mr. Mellichampe must be conveyed to the city—his trial must immediately follow, and I need not say how immediately thereupon must follow his conviction and—” “Say no more—say no more,” shrieked, rather than spoke, his auditor. “And yet, Miss Berkeley—” “Yet what?” she demanded, hurriedly. “These dangers may be averted. The youth may be saved.” She looked up doubtingly, and, as she saw the expression in his eyes, she shook her head in despair. She read at a glance the conditions. “I see you understand me, Miss Berkeley.” “I cannot deny that I think I do, sir,” was her prompt reply. “And yet, as you may not, better that I speak my thoughts plainly. I can save Mr. Mellichampe—I am ready to do so,—for, though my enemy, I feel that I love another far more than I can possibly hate him. I will save him for that other. Does Miss Berkeley hear— will she heed?” Barsfield might well ask these questions, for the thoughts of Janet were evidently elsewhere. His finger rested upon her hand, and she started as from a sudden danger. There was a bitter smile upon the lips of the tory, as he noticed the shuddering emotion with which she withdrew her hand. Her attention, however, seeming now secured, he continued his suggestions. “I will save the life of the prisoner—he shall be free as air, Miss Berkeley, if, in return, you will—” “Oh, Captain Barsfield, this is all very idle, and not less painful than idle. You know it cannot be. You know me not if you can think it for a moment longer. It is impossible, sir, that I can survive Mellichampe— still more impossible that I can survive his love, or give my own to another. Leave me now, sir, I pray you. Leave me now. We can speak no more together. You can have nothing farther to say, as you can have nothing worse to communicate.” “But, Miss Berkeley—” He would have spoken, but she waved her hand impatiently. He saw, at a glance, how idle would be all farther effort, and the murderous nature within him grew active with this conviction. His hate to Mellichampe was now shared equally with his betrothed. The parting look which he gave her, as he left the apartment, did not encounter any consciousness in hers, or she might have dreaded, in the next instant, to feel the venomous fang of the serpent. Her strength failed her after his departure. Restrained till then, her emotions grew insupportable the moment she was left alone; and when Rose Duncan, apprized of Barsfield's absence, sought her in the room where the conference had taken place, she found her stretched upon the floor, only not enough insensible to escape from the mental agony which the new situation of things had forced upon her.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “Is he gone?” were the first, shudderingly expressed words, which the suffering maiden addressed to Rose Duncan, as the latter assisted her in rising from the floor. Her eyes were red and swollen—her glance wild, wandering, and strangely full of light—her lips compressed with a visible effort, as if to restrain the expression of those emotions which were still so powerfully felt and shown. Instead of replying to the question of Janet, Rose could not forbear an exclamation of partial rebuke. “I warned you—I told you not to see him, Janet. You are now sorry for it.” “No—no! I must have known-it, and better as it is —better, better as it is, to know it all,—there is no second stroke—no other that can now be felt, except— God of Heaven! have mercy, and save me from that!' She buried her face in the bosom of Rose, and sobbed with convulsive sorrows, as her imagination presented to her eye the probable result of the trial to which her lover was to be subjected. “He never spares, Rose—he has no mercies! From the place of trial to the place of death, it is but a step! So the malignant Barsfield said it, and so it will be with such judges as Balfour and Tarleton.” And, as she spoke, she closed her eyes, as if to shut out the dreadful images of doom and death which were gathering thickly before her. It was only in fitful starts of speech that Rose could gather from her companion the truth of her situation and the cause of her grief. It was only by successive pictures of the dreadful events which she anticipated, as they severally came to her mind, and not by any effort at narration, that she was enabled to convey to that of Rose the cruel nature of the intelligence which Barsfield had conveyed in his interview. The anger of Rose grew violent when she heard it, and that of Janet immediately subsided. She could the better perceive the futility of uttered grief, when she perceived the inadequacy of all words to describe her emotions. Grief, like Rapture, was born dumb. But if Janet suffered thus much at first hearing of this sad intelligence, she did not suffer less when communicacating it that evening to her lover. Could she have suffered for him—could she have felt all the agony of her present thoughts, assured that it lay with her alone to endure all and let him go free, she would not have murmured—she would have had no uttered grief. But the dreadful task was before her of saying to her lover that the hour of their parting, and probably their final parting, was at hand. How much less painful to have heard it from his lips to her, than to breathe it from her lips into his ears. She could endure the stroke coming from him, but she thought—and this was the thought of one who loved unselfishly—that she shared in the cruelty—that she became a party to the crime, and its immediate instrument, in unfolding the dreadful intelligence to him. “He will hate me—he will regard it as my deed,—and oh! how can I look as I tell him this,—how can features express such feelings—such a sorrow as is mine!” Such were the sobbing and broken words with which she sought her lover. She strove, however, to compose her countenance. She even laboured—foolish endeavour! to restrain—to subdue her emotions. But when was the heart of woman—properly constituted only for intense feeling, and entire dependance that admits of no qualified love—to be restrained and subjected by a merely human will. There was that at her heart which would not be compelled. The feeling only gathered itself up for a moment the better to expand. The restraint gave it new powers of action, and, though she appeared in the presence of Mellichampe with a countenance in which a smile even strove for place and existence, it was yet evident to herself that the power of self-control was rapidly departing from her. The strife of encountering feelings was going on within—the earthquake toiling below, though sunshine and flowers only were visible without. It was with a joy so intense as to be tremulous, that Mellichampe received her. His confinement had made him still more a dependant upon her presence and affections. His love for her had duly increased with its daily exercise; and, in the absence of other and exciting influences, it had become a regular, constant, and increasing flame, which concentrated almost all his thoughts, and certainly governed and linked itself with all his emotions. He longed for her coming as the anticipative boy longs for the hour of promised enjoyment—with a feverish thirst no less intense, and an anxious earnestness far more lofty and enduring. When the latch was lifted he ran forward to receive her, caught her extended hand in both of his own, and carried it warmly and passionately to his lips. She could scarce effect her release, and the blush mingled with the labouring smile upon her lips, which it rather tended to strengthen than displace. “Oh, Janet—my own Janet—what an age of absence! How long you were in coming this evening!— what has kept you, and wherefore? Truly, I began to fear that you were tired of your office.” “No—no, Ernest—I cannot tire, since it is so sweet to serve. If I sought for mere pleasure and amusement in love, I might tire of its sameness; but the love of my heart is its devotion, and the better feelings of our nature, like the God from whom they come, are the more dear to us, and the more lovely in his sight, as they are never subject to change.” “Beautiful sentiment!” was the involuntary exclamation of the youth, as he looked in her face and saw, through the gathering tears in her eyes, the high-souled seriousness—the sanctified earnestness of heart, which proved that she felt the truth of the thought which she had uttered. Love was, indeed, the religion of Janet Berkeley. It was in her to love all things in nature, and to gather sweets from all its influences. Even the subduing grief to which she was more than commonly subject, brought into increased activity the love which she felt for him who stood before her, yet awakened no opposite feeling in her bosom against those who sought to do him wrong. “Beautiful sentiment!” he exclaimed, passionately, “and worthy of your heart, my Janet. Love is its constant occupation, and I believe, dearest, that you could not help but love on, even if I were to forget your devotedness and my own pledge to you. Would you not, Janet?” “I know not that, Ernest. I have never thought of that, but I think I could die then;” and the last words were uttered in his folding arms, and came to his ears like the sweet murmur of angel voices in a dream. “Heaven forbid, my Janet, that I should ever do you wrong, however slight! It would pain me to think that you could imagine the possibility of a wrong at my hands, and through my agency. True love, dearest, is a thing of entire confidence, and nothing seems to me so sweet as the knowledge that you have no emotion, no feeling or thought, which you do not give up to my keeping. It may be, indeed, that the thoughts and feelings of women have little comparative value, so far as the interests of men and of nations are concerned; but, valueless or not, they are thoughts and feelings with her— her all—her only,—and, as such, they should be of permanent value with him who loves her. How much that was unimportant—nay, how much that was positive nonsense—did we say to each other last evening—and yet, Janet, to me it was the sweetest nonsense.” And, smiling and folding her in his arms with the respectful fondness of a natural affection, he poured forth as garrulous a tale in her ears as if he had not long and frequently before narrated to her his own experience of heart, and demanded hers in return. But she could not now respond to his garrulity. It was not that she felt not with him—not that the heart had suffered change, and the love had grown inconstant, though, beholding her abstraction, with this he had reproached her; but, reminded as she was of the joys which they had promised themselves togehter in their frequent and sweet interviews, she was now only the more forcibly taught to feel the violent wrenching away from hope which the cunning of Barsfield, and the bloody tyranny of Balfour and Tarleton, were preparing for them both. She could only throw herself upon his manly bosom, like some heart-stricken and desponding dependant, and sob, as if, with every convulsion, life would render up its sacred responsibility. It is needless to say how alarmed—how shocked was Mellichampe, as he witnessed emotions so suddenly and strangely violent. Since he had been a prisoner and wounded, with Janet attending upon him, life had been to them both all couleur de rose. Insensibly they had both forgotten the restraints and difficulties, if not the dangers, of his situation. They had lived only for love; they had forgotten all privations in its enjoyments; and, as the circumstances attending Mellichampe had made all farther concealment unnecessary of the tie which bound them so sweetly and inseparably together, their mutual hearts revelled in the freedom which their release from all the old restraints necessarily brought to them. Next to the joy of contemplating the beloved object, is the pride with which we can challenge it for our own; and that feeling of pride, of itself, grew into a sentiment of pleasure in the hourly and free survey of the object in the eye of others; as the devotee of a new faith, who has long worshipped in secret, avails himself of the first moment of emancipation to build a proud temple to the God of his hidden idolatry. Thus moved towards each other, and free, as it were, to love securely for the first time, the two, so blessed, had forgotten all other considerations. His wound ceased to be a pain, and almost a care, since it was so entirely the care of the maiden; and her tendance made the moments precious of his confinement, and he blessed the evils which placed him in a relationship the most desirable, and far the most delightful, of any he had ever known. To the maiden, the very assumption of some of the cares of life, in attending upon the object most beloved, was eminently grateful, as it was the first step which she had yet taken towards the performance of some of those duties for which woman is peculiarly formed, and for which her gentle regards and affectionate tendernesses Vol. II.—F 11 make her particularly fitted. They occupied her mind while they interested her heart the more; and so completely did they absorb thoughts and affections in the brief period of his confinement and sickness, that she no longer heeded the hourly din of the military music around her; and the shrill note of the bugle, which heretofore sent a thrill of dreadful apprehension to her soul whenever its warlike summons smote upon her ear, now failed entirely to remind her of those causes of apprehension to which she had been before always most sensitively alive. From this dream of pleasure, in which every thought and feeling which might have counselled pain or doubt had been merged and lost sight of, she had been too suddenly aroused by the cruel communication of Barsfield. The long train of pleasant sensations, hopes, and joys, departed in that instant; and in their place rose up all the accustomed forms of fierce war and brutal outrage, with the additional horrors of that peculiar danger to which the circumstances connected with her lover's captivity and situation had subjected him. As these successive images of terror rose up before her imagination and crowded upon her mind, the strong resolution with which she had determined upon their mastery quite gave way, and she fell upon the neck of her lover, yielding to all the weakness of her heart, and refusing any longer to contend with her griefs. Nor could he for some time obtain from her a knowledge of her cause of sorrow. She could only sob, not speak. Once or twice she strove earnestly to articulate, but the words choked her in their utterance, and they terminated in convulsive but unsyllabled sounds. He bore her to a seat, and knelt down beside her, supporting her head upon his shoulder. Earnestly and fondly did he seek to sooth the paroxysm under which she suffered, and vainly, for a long while, did he implore her to be calm and speak forth her griefs. When at length she so far recovered herself as to raise her head from his shoulder and fix her eye upon his face, the glance was instantly averted, as if with horror, and the tears burst forth afresh. With that glance came the thought of the hour when that noble head should be in the grasp of the executioner—that manly, high, pure white brow obscured by his cowling blind—and that polished and lifted neck grasped by the polluting halter. These were the dreadful thoughts which came crowding to her mind on that instant; and they might have been the thoughts and the apprehensions, at that period, of a far more masculine mind than that of Janet Berkeley; for, what was so common then as the certainty of execution to the accused American?—what so sure as the execution of death to one doomed by Balfour, Tarleton, or Cornwallis? In these hands lay the destiny of her lover. A few days would convey him to the place of trial. A few hours travel through all its abridged forms, and the hurried process of examination, misrepresenting justice; and how brief was the sad interval allowed for the final preparation between the doom and its execution. These thoughts, which, to the strong and fearless man, would have been only so many stirring apprehensions, were a full conviction in the gentle heart of the timid and fond Janet. She feared the worst, and, being of no sanguine temper, she saw no hope upon which to lean for succour. Nothing but clouds and storms rose before her sight, and her love, undeviating and growing warmer to the last, was the only star that rayed out in blessing through the thickness and the gloom. “Oh, what, dearest Janet, is this suffering that wrings you thus? What dream of danger,—what wild apprehension—troubles you? Speak to me,—say what you know. Let me relieve your sorrows, or, at least, share them with you.” It was thus that the youth pleaded—it was thus that he fondly implored her to pour the griefs of her bosom F 2 into his, and make him a partaker of those evils which she evidently was not strong enough to bear alone. She replied by sobs, and it was only at remote intervals that, coupling together the broken parts of her speech, he was enabled to gather from her that he was about to be carried to Charleston as a prisoner. Hearing thus much, the first thought of Mellichampe was one gratifying to his vanity, and grateful in the extreme to his own warm affections. He clasped her fervently to his heart as he replied— “And you grieve thus at our parting—at the prospect of our separation. Ah, dearest, sweet is this additional evidence of your sole-hearted love. But it will not be long,—I will soon return,—I only go to be exchanged.” “Oh, no, no, no!—never—never! You will return no more. It is false, Ernest—false! No exchange— no exchange! They carry you to Balfour and to Tarleton,—to be tried—to die!—to die!” Incoherently then, but with the utmost rapidity, she explained to him the circumstances which Barsfield had narrated to her. His astonishment far exceeded her own apprehensions, and, after the first feeling of indignant surprise was over, he calmly and confidently enough sought to reassure her mind on the subject. “Fear nothing, my Janet. They dare do nothing of what you fear; and this charge against me, of being a spy upon their camp, is too ridiculous to need any refutation, and should occasion no concern.” The composure of her lover failed to satisfy her. “Alas! Ernest, no charge is too ridiculous with them. How many have suffered from charges equally idle in the minds of honest men!” This was a truth well known to Mellichampe, and fully as strong in his mind as a cause of apprehension as it was in the mind of the maiden; but, with that pride of character and soldierly resolve which were becoming in the man, he did not allow his own fears to strengthen hers. He overruled her reply, and rejected entirely the anticipation of any danger resulting from the prospect of a trial in the city under an allegation which, in his case, he esteemed so idle. “I can soon disprove the charge, my Janet,—I have witnesses enough to show what my motives were in coming to Piney Grove that night. For, Janet, you yourself, dearest, could speak for me—” “I could—I could, dear Ernest—” “But should not,” he replied; “you should not suffer such exposure to the rude soldiers as such a task would call for. No, no, my love, there will be no need of this. The scoundrel Barsfield only seeks to alarm or to annoy you. Perhaps, too, he has some object in it. This affair is his entirely; Tarleton and Balfour have nothing to do with it, and Cornwallis is far off in North Carolina.” “Not so, Ernest. Barsfield has convinced me that the orders are from Tarleton: for, when I doubted his word, he showed me the letter of Tarleton, written with his own hand.” “Ah! then there is something in it,” was the involuntary exclamation of the youth. Then, as he beheld the immediate effect of his own gloomy look and speech upon the countenance of the maiden, he proceeded in a more cheerful manner. “But I fear them not, my Janet—they cannot, they dare not harm me. I can prove my innocence, even should they proceed to the threatened trial, which I misdoubt they never will do; and, if they do me less than justice, my countrymen will avenge it.” But such an assurance gave no animated hope to Janet. Her tears burst forth afresh, and she clung to his arm and hung upon his shoulder droopingly and despondingly. “Hear me, Janet, dear love, and have no apprehensions. You know not how strong is our security now 11* against any such crimes in future, as these tyrants have been in the habit of committing upon the brave men who have fallen into their hands. We have required our commander to retaliate unsparingly, and Marion has pledged himself to do so. When his pledge is given, it is sacred. We have called upon him to avenge upon a prisoner of equal grade any execution of our officers by the British commanders; and we have freely subscribed our names to the paper, in which we offer our lives freely to sustain him in such a course, and thus afford a solemn proof of our sincerity. The enemy is not unadvised of this, and they have become cautious since that affair of Camden. We hear of no more executions—they know better, my love, than to proceed in this matter to any length. They will pay dearly for every drop which is shed of my blood.” “Alas! Ernest—this consoles me nothing. On the contrary, this very pledge which you have given to Marion, calling for retaliation upon the British, and promising to abide the consequences with your own life, will it not make you only the more obnoxious to them? Will they not be the more disposed to punish you for that— and will it not prompt them to receive the most ridiculous charge with favour, if it promises to secure them a victim in one who has shown so much audacity? I fear me, Ernest, that this very matter has led Tarleton to forget his promise to me, and determines him to make you abide the penalty for which you have pledged yourself. Perhaps, too, it may be, that Marion, in obedience to the pledge given to you, has executed some British officer.” This was a plausible suggestion, and did not tend in the slightest degree to assure Mellichampe of the integrity of his own opinions. It made him thoughtful for a while, and increased the gloomy density of the prospect before him; but he did not suffer himself to forget for an instant that it was his business to prevent the maiden from brooding apprehensively upon a subject so calculated to make her miserable, and which had already so painfully worked upon her feelings. He strove, by alternate defiance and ridicule, to show that the danger was not so great when it was approached—that the British did not dare do what was threatened; and that, however willing and desirous they might be to shed the blood of their enemies, a discreet consideration of their own safety would keep them in future from any wanton execution of their prisoners. “And should they, in their madness, attempt my life, the vengeance which would follow the deed would be such as would make them repent of the error to the latest moment. Life for life would be the atoning requisition of Marion, and of every officer pledged to retaliation along with myself.” But that which, in the shape of revenge, had the power to console in part the audacious soldier, failed utterly to produce a like effect upon the maiden. Her tears came forth afresh at these words, and mournfully she sobbed out the reply which most effectually silenced all farther assurances of this nature. “Alas! Ernest—but this vengeance, which would be taken by your brethren in arms, would be nothing to me. To revenge your fate would not be to restore you; and for all my vengeance I look only to Heaven. Speak not to me of these things, dearest Ernest—they only make the danger seem more real, and it looks more closely at hand when you speak thus.” “Then hear me on another topic, Janet.” She looked up inquiringly, and the tears began to dry upon her cheek as she beheld a bright light and a gathering elasticity of expression in his eyes. Her head was thrown back as she looked up into his face, while his extended hands grasped her arms tenderly. “I will not risk this trial, Janet—I will escape from this double bondage—yours and the enemy's.” “How!” was the wondering exclamation of the maiden. “I have a thought, not yet fully matured in my mind, by which I think my escape may be effected. But no more of it now. That is the footstep of the surgeon. Away, dearest, and have no fears. Despond not, I pray you, but be ready with all your strength of mind to give me your assistance, for I greatly depend on you in my design.” With a hurried embrace they separated as the surgeon entered the chamber; and Janet hurried away, with a full heart and troubled mind, to pray for her lover's safety, and to dream of his coming danger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. But it was not for the maiden to retire that night to her slumbers without some better assurances for hope than those contained in the parting intimation of her lover. An auxiliary, but little looked for, was at hand; and, as she left the little antechamber in which her interview with Mellichampe had taken place, she felt her sleeve plucked by some one from behind. She turned in some trepidation, which was instantly relieved, however, as her eye distinguished the intruder to be Blonay. The distorted features of this man had never offended Janet, as they were apt commonly to offend those of others. She saw nothing in mere physical deformity, at any time, to hate or to despise; and, as pity was always the most ready and spontaneous sentiment of her soul, she had regarded him from the first—as she knew nothing of his moral deformities—with none but sentiments of commiseration and indulgence. The effect of this treatment, and of these invariable shows of sympathy on her part, was always made visible in his deportment and look whenever he approached her. He strove, on all such occasions, to subdue and keep down those expressions of hate, cunning, and cupidity, which a long practice in the various arts of human warfare had rendered, if not the natural, the habitual features of his face. A ludicrous combination of natural ugliness with smiles, intended for those of complaisance and regard, was the consequence of these efforts; and, however unsuccessful the Half-Breed may have been in the assumption of an expression so foreign to his own, the attempt, as it conveyed a desire to please and make himself agreeable, was sufficient to commend him to the indulgence of one so gentle of mood as Janet Berkeley. Approaching her now, the countenance of Blonay wore its most seductive expression. The grin of good feeling was of the most extravagant dimensions, expanding the mouth from ear to ear; while the goggle eyes above, from the vastness of the effort below, were contracted to the smallest possible limits. But for this good-natured expression, the mysterious caution of his approach might have alarmed the maiden. A single start, as she recognised him, only testified her surprise, and she paused quietly the moment after, to learn his motive for the interruption. “Hist, miss—I ax your pardon, but please let me come after you in the room; I want to tell you something.” She did not scruple to bid him follow her, and they entered the apartment in which she had conversed with Barsfield. There she found Rose Duncan awaiting her. Janet signed to Rose to leave them for a while, and the moment they were alone the Half-Breed drew nigh, and in a whisper, and with an air of great mystery, commenced as follows:— F 3 “You've hearn from the cappin, miss, about the young man what's a prisoner here?” He spoke affirmatively, though with an inquiring expression of countenance, and Janet nodded her head assentingly. “Adrat it, miss, if they ever gits the young man to Charleston city, there's no chance for him; so the cappin says.” He paused. At a loss to determine what could be the motive of the scout in thus addressing her upon this topic, yet fondly believing that he had some plan of service in reserve, by which he hoped to commend himself, she strongly mastered her feelings, which every reference to the painful topic brought into increased and trying activity, and, bowing her head as she spoke, she simply responded— “True, sir—yes—I fear it; but what can be done?” This question, though uttered unconsciously, and entirely unintended, was, however, to the point, and the answer of Blonay was immediate— “Ah, that's it, miss—what's to be done? The cappin says something's to be done, but he can't do it, you see, 'cause they trusts him, and he can't break his trust. It's much as his neck's worth, you see, to do it.” With some surprise, she inquired of whom he spoke? “Why, you don't know the cappin that's here—Cappin Barsfield. He says as how the young man's to be hung if he gits to Charleston, and how he must get away before; and he tells me I'm to try and git him off, without letting the sodgers see.” “Barsfield—Barsfield say this—Barsfield do this, Mr. Blonay? Impossible!—you do not know the man!” “It's a round truth, miss—he tell'd me so with his own mouth, and tell'd me—ax pardon, miss, but I must tell you all what he said—” He paused hesitatingly. “Speak boldly,” she said, encouragingly. “He said, miss, as how he loved you, though you didn't fancy him no how, and hadn't no thought 'cept for the young fellow that's a prisoner; and how he wanted to help the young man, though he didn't like him no how; and he would do so, if 'twas only to do you pleasure.” “And he told you this?” inquired the maiden, in unmixed astonishment. “Jist the words, miss.” “Indeed!” “Yes; and he said as how he couldn't help the young man off, for he had to watch him, but that I must do it; and he gave me this money to do it.” “And did he counsel you to tell me of this?” “No, miss, he only tell'd me to tell you that I could git the young fellow out of prison, and git you to make him know how he was to do, and all about it; but the cappin told me I wasn't to say nothing about him in the business, for he said you hated him so you would think something wrong if you knew he had a hand in it.” “And I do think there is something wrong in it. Heaven help me! what new plot is he weaving now? What new mischief would he contrive? Is Mellichampe never to escape his toils? Would to Heaven that I had a friend!” “Adrat it, miss, but ain't I willing to be your friend? and I won't ax you for no pay. I'm a poor sort of body enough, and you're a sweet lady; but I'm willing to be your friend, and to pull trigger for you, if needs be and the time comes for it. Jist say now that I shall be your friend, and there's no telling how much I can help you in this here squabble.” “You can help me nothing, I fear me, Mr. Blonay; and as for this plan of Captain Barsfield, I will have nothing to do with it or him. I doubt—I suspect all his plans; and however much he may profess of regard for me, I look upon this employment of you, for the purpose of which you speak, as only a new scheme for the entrapment of Mr. Mellichampe.” “That's jist what I was going to tell you, miss; for, you see, it don't stand to reason, that when a man hates another to kill, he's going to help him to git away; and so, when the cappin first spoke to me, I was bewildered like, and said I'd do it; but, soon as I got in the bush, and begun to think about it, adrat it! the whole contrivance stood clear before me, and so I went back to him.” “For what?' “Well, you see, to tell him as how I couldn't think to handle the thing, for I didn't see to the bottom of it.” “Well—what then?” “Why, then he up and tell'd me all the whole truth— all what he kept before; and, sure enough, 'twas jist as I thought, and jist what you think. The cappin only wanted to have a drive himself at the young fellow, and he thought, if he could git me to talk to you, and make fine promises as how I could git him out of prison, why, I should lead him into a trap that he'd set, so that there would be no gitting off.” “You refused?” “No,—reckon not. I worn't a fool, you see. I know'd if I said no, it wouldn't be so safe for me any longer in these parts; and then agin I know'd if he didn't git me he'd git somebody else, so I took the money, and promised to do my best and to try you.” “I thank you, Mr. Blonay,—from my heart I thank you. You have done me good service indeed, and you shall be rewarded. Had you not told me all of this business—had you suppressed the connexion of Captain Barsfield with the design, I might have accepted your services for Mr. Mellichampe; nay, I must have been driven, by the desperate situation in which he stands, to consent to his flight under your direction. And then, —oh, horrible to think upon!—my hand would have been instrumental in his murder. I should have prepared the snare which was to give his victim to this bloody man!” She preserved her coolness, though trembling with the new emotions which the communication of Blonay had inspired, and drew from him, by a series of questions, the whole dialogue which had taken place between him and the tory. From these developments she was persuaded—not that her lover was likely to escape at the coming trial, and thus defeat the wishes of his enemy— but that the anxious thirst of Barsfield for his revenge in person made him unwilling to lose his prey, even through the hands of the executioner. With this impression her misery was doubly increased. She saw nothing but dangers and difficulties on every hand. Should Mellichampe be carried safely to the city, what but a cruel and bitter death awaited him there! But could he be carried there in safety? This seemed to her impossible. Would he not go under the custody of Barsfield's creatures? No longer guarded by her watchful attendance—no longer safe from the presence and the obtrusion of others, would not his enemy then have those thousand opportunities for working out his vengeance which now were denied him by the excellent arrangements made by Tarleton? And, if he fled before that period came, what but the knife or the pistol of the waylaying ruffian could she expect for him in his flight? As these fears and thoughts accumulated in her mind, she found herself scarcely able to maintain a proper firmness in the presence of the savage. She accordingly prepared to dismiss him, and had already put in his hands a small sum of gold, which he did not demur to receive, when she remembered that it might be of advantage, and was certainly only her duty, to disclose these circumstances to Mellichampe before finally rejecting the proposition. 12 “Seek me to-morrow,” she said, hurriedly—“seek me in private, when the troops are on parade. Keep yourself unseen, Mr. Blonay, and we will then speak more on this matter.” At the earliest opportunity on the morning of the next day she sought Mellichampe, and unfolded all the particulars of the interview with Blonay. The speech of her lover, as he listened to her communication, astounded her not a little. “Admirable!—Excellent!” were the words of exultation with which he received the intelligence. “This will do admirably, dear Janet, and corresponds finely with a plan which I had conceived in part. A good plan, attended with difficulties, however, which, without the aid of Blonay, I could not so easily have overcome. I now see my way through. The scheme of Barsfield will help me somewhat to the execution of my own project, and must greatly facilitate my chances of escape.” “Speak—how—say, dear Ernest,” cried the maiden, breathlessly. “Hear me. We will accept of the services of this fellow Blonay,—I will take his guidance.” “What! to be murdered!” “No! to escape.” She shook her head doubtfully. “Listen!” he proceeded. “Blonay is trusted by Barsfield, and evidently does not trust in return. It is shown sufficiently in the development which he has made to you of all the plans of the tory. We do not see exactly why this should be so, but so it evidently is. The probability is, indeed, that Blonay is conscious that he has no claim upon Barsfield after he shall have served him by my death, and he fears that he himself will be as soon murdered by his employer when he shall have discharged his agency, in order to the better concealment of his own share in my escape. There are no ties among ruffians save those of a common interest, and the policy of Barsfield will be the destruction of one to whom he has been compelled to confide so much. According to Blonay's own showing, the necessity of the case extorted from the tory a confession of his true design, which, before, he was disposed to withhold. Unfaithful to Barsfield, the Half-Breed will be faithful to me; and, from all that I can see, there must be some secret reason for his desire to serve you, which you will learn in time. Meanwhile we will accept his services,—we will make the most of him, and bride high in order to secure him at all points.” “But may not all this be only another form of deception, dear Ernest?” cried the less sanguine maiden. “Think you we can rely upon one whom money can buy? Alas! Ernest, it seems to me that these dangers grow more terrible and numerous the more we survey them.” “To be sure they do, dear Janet,—the thing is a proverb. But we should never look at the fear, but the hope—never at the danger, always at the success. Whether Blonay be honest or not, it matters no great deal to me in the plan which I have formed. To a certain extent we may still rely upon him, and be independent of him in every other respect. We want but little at his hands—little in his thought, and little in that of Barsfield—if it be the design of the latter to entrap me into flight the better to effect my murder. I only desire to secure my escape beyond this dwelling,—to escape these sentinels, and once more plant my footstep in the green woods that grow around us. Let him help me but to that degree of freedom, and I ask nothing farther. Let the strife come then—let the ambuscade close then its toils about me, and the danger appear. I shall then be free: my arms to strike—my voice to shout aloud—my soul to exult in the fresh air of these old forests, though I perish the very next moment.” “Speak not so, Ernest,” she implored. “I must: for I will then breathe again in freedom, though I breathe in death. I shall complain nothing of the fight.” “This is madness, Ernest. This is only flying from one form of death to another.” “Granted—and that is much. Who would not fly to the knife, or the sudden shot, to escape the cord—the degradation—the high tree—and the howling hate that surrounds it, and mingles in with the last agonies of death. Such escape would be freedom, though it brought death along with it. But I would not die, my Janet; with proper management I should be secure.” He spoke with an air of confidence that almost reassured her. “How?” she cried, anxiously; “tell me all—tell me your hope, Ernest. How will you escape—by what management?” “By the simplest agency in the world. Hear me: Even now that trusty fellow Witherspoon is lurking around my prison. Only last night, just after you left me, I heard his signals close upon, and evidently this side of, the avenue. But for the fear of provoking suspicion I should have answered them. He is about me night and day—he will sooner desert the squad than me. And thus he will remain;—if I can convey intelligence to him, I can do any thing—I can effect my escape. I can put it out of the power of Barsfield to do me any harm, unless he does it in fair fight.” “But how will you do this; and what can I do towards it?” “Much, dearest—very much. But hear me farther. If I can say to Witherspoon, On such a night I fly from my prison,—I meet you at such a place,—I pursue such a course,—I apprehend an ambuscade, and will require that a counter-ambuscade be set,—ha! do you see?” “Yes—yes—go on.” “He will understand,—it will come to him like a light—like a light from Heaven. He will not be able to bring men enough to encounter Barsfield's whole force, which has been growing largely, you tell me, but he will bring enough to tell against the few whom the tory will employ for my murder, and thus—ah! you understand me now.” “Yes, Ernest, but still I fear.” “I hope!—what do you fear?” “The fighting—” “And, if I am free, dear Janet, I should still have to fight until the war is over—until the invader has gone from the land.” “Yes, but—oh, Ernest, if there should not be men enough?—if they should not come in time—?” “These are risks which I must take hourly, my beloved, and of which I may not complain now. Remember the dreadful risk which I incur while remaining. Is there no risk in going under a guard to Charleston, to be tried as a spy,—and by such judges as Balfour, Rawdon, and Tarleton?” She shuddered, but said nothing. He continued— “No, my love, I must not scruple to avail myself of the help of Blonay, whether he be true or false. Let him but help me beyond this prison—to those woods—I ask from him no more. Let him lead me to the ambuscade. If we can convey intelligence to Witherspoon, we shall provide for it. I shall withhold every thing from Blonay that might place us in his power. He shall know nothing of our plans, but be suffered to pursue his own. He shall guide me beyond the prison,— that is all that I require; and as it is Barsfield's own plan which we so far follow up, he will doubtless effect all necessary arrangements for speeding me beyond the regular guards in safety. Once let me reach the avenue, and I leave his guidance and take the opposite path, where I propose that Witherspoon shall place his men.” 12* “And you will, then, employ Blonay to convey this matter to Witherspoon?” “No, no. We must have a trustier friend than Blonay for such a business, and this is another difficulty. Blonay could never find Witherspoon unless provided with certain passwords, which, as they furnish the key to the very dwelling of the “swamp fox,' I may not confide wantonly.” “Trust me, then, dear Ernest; I will seek him,—I will not betray the trust, though they make even death the instrument for extorting it from my lips.” “True heart—dear love—I thank you for this devotion, but I must seek an humbler agent.” “Who?” “Scipio. I will trust him, and you shall counsel him, as I am not permitted to see him here, or to go beyond my prison. To you will I give these words—to you will I confide all the requisitions which I make upon Witherspoon for the object in view, and we must then arrange with Blonay to pave the way for my flight from the dwelling, holding him, and, through him, his base employer, to the idea that I fly upon the first suggestion of Blonay, having no hope of aid from without.” And thus, strong in his hope of success, and buoyant with the promise of an escape from the dangers of that mock trial, but real judgment, which had been held up before him, and which he regarded with no less earnestness, though with nothing of the fear of his feminine companion, he detailed to the maiden the entire plan which he had formed of flight, and, whispering in her ear the passwords which led her through every scout and sentry watching around the camp of Marion, he left it to her to pencil the message to Witherspoon, which he calculated would bring sufficient aid for the service upon which he was required. The spirits of Janet rose with the task thus put upon her. To be employed for him she loved, in peril no less than in trouble, was the supremest happiness to a heart so loving and so true as hers. Her quick mind readily conceived the tasks before her, and her devoted heart led her as quickly to their performance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. Janet lost no time in the performance of her duties. She immediately sought out the Half-Breed. He lingered about the dwelling, and was soon called into her presence. It was with no small surprise that he now listened to the determination of the maiden to avail herself, on behalf of her lover, of the services of the scout in the very equivocal aid which he had been prompted to offer by the tory. His astonishment could not be suppressed. “It surprises you,” she said, “but so Mr. Mellichampe has determined. He thinks it better to risk all other dangers than that of a dishonest trial before bloody judges in the city.” The Half-Breed shook his head. “Well, now, it's mighty foolish; for, as sure as a gun, Miss Janet, the cappin's mighty serious about this matter, and there'll be no chance for the young gentleman, no how. He'd better not think of it now, I tell you.” “I thank you, Mr. Blonay—I thank you, I'm sure, for the interest you take in me and him; but, whatever be the danger, Mr. Mellichampe is determined upon it, if you'll only give him your assistance.” “Adrat it! he shall have that, fur as I can go for him. Say what I'm to do that's in reason, and I'll do it.” “You must procure him some arms for his defence. If there is danger, you know, he should be provided with some weapons to meet it.” “Arms!—a sword p'rhaps—a knife—reckon he'd like pistols too—” “Whatever he can get.” “I'll try—but there's no saying. I'll do what I can.” “He desires no more of you. Next, you must find out exactly where Captain Barsfield puts his ambuscade.” “Eh!—that's the trap, you mean?” “Yes—find out that, get the weapons, and at midnight to-morrow he will be ready to go with you.” “To-morrow night—midnight!—well, now, Miss Janet, that'll be a bad time, seeing that there'll be a bright moon then.” She paused—hesitated—but a moment after repeated the order. “It must be then. He wishes it to be so—he has so determined.” “Jist as you say, miss. I'm ready—though it's a mighty tough sort of business, I tell you; and the cappin's got a ground knife for the lad, I reckon. He hates him pretty bad, and won't miss his chance if he can help it.” “Be you true to us, Mr. Blonay; be you true, and I hope for the best. Be you true to us, as you would hope for God's blessing on your life hereafter. Take this purse, Mr. Blonay—the gift is small, I know, but it will prove to you how grateful I am for what you have done for me, and be an earnest of what I shall give you for your continued fidelity.” She put a richly wrought purse of silk into his hands, through the interstices of which the Half-Breed beheld distinctly the rich yellow of the goodly coin which filled it. It was no part of his morality to refuse money on any terms, and he did not affect any hesitation on the present occasion. It found its way readily into a general reservoir, which was snugly concealed by his dress, and there became kindred with the guineas which Barsfield had bestowed upon him for a very different service. Though without doubt intending to be faithful to Janet, and himself distrusting Barsfield on his own account, the gift of the maiden stimulated his fidelity, and he seriously, though in his own rude and broken manner, attempted to dissuade her from the project. Janet heard him patiently, thanked him for his counsel, but reiterated the determination of Mellichampe to abide his chance. “Well—if that's the how,” he exclaimed, conclusively, the butt of his rifle sinking heavily upon the floor as he spoke—“if that's the how, and he's bent to take his chance, he must go through with it—though I warn you, Miss Janet, there'll be main hard fighting—” “Be sure you get the weapons,” she said, interrupting him. “I'll try; for he'll want 'em bad, I tell you. I'll do my best, and if so be I can git him out of the scrape, it won't be the guineas, Miss Janet, that'll make me do it. You're a lady, every inch of you, and I'll work for you jist the same as if you hadn't gi'n me any thing; and—” in a half-whisper concluding the sentence—“if it comes to the scratch, you see, adrat it! I won't stop very long to put it to the cappin's own head,” and he touched significantly the lock of his rifle. She shuddered slightly, not so much at the action or the words as at the dreadful look which accompanied them. “To-morrow I shall see you, then?” she said, as he was about to leave her. “You go now, I suppose, to communicate to Captain Barsfield?” “Yes—off hand. He tell'd me to come to him soon as I'd got your answer.” “Do so, Mr. Blonay—and, remember the hour—remember the arms!” The scout was gone—the die was cast—and the feelings of the woman grew uppermost with his departure. She sank into a chair, and was relieved by a flood of tears. The intelligence brought by the Half-Breed rejoiced the heart of the tory. “And when does he propose to take advantage of your offer? What time has he appointed for the flight?” he demanded, eagerly. The scout, more cunning than Janet, had his answer— “That he leaves to me. I'm to git things ready, you see, cappin, and when I tells him I'm ready to show the track, he'll set out upon it with me.” “'Tis well! You have done excellently, Blonay, and shall fare the better for it. I feared that she might be suspicious of you; but the case is desperate,—she thinks so, at least, and that is enough. Tarleton and Balfour are not known as merciful judges, and Mellichampe is prudent to take any other risk.” The tory spoke rather to himself than to his companion. The latter, however, did not suffer him to waste much time in unnecessary musing. He put his inquiries with the freedom of one confident of his importance. “And now, cappin, which track am I to take? You wants to fix a sort of trap, and—” “Ay—yes! But you must let me know the hour upon which you start, in order that I may prepare before-hand.” “Sartain,” was the unhesitating reply. Barsfield proceeded— “The mere departure from the house will be easy enough. He must go in safety out of the immediate enclosure. Nothing must be done to harm him in close neighbourhood of the dwelling. The sentinel guarding the gallery will be missing from his watch at the hour on which you tell me the prisoner is disposed to start. Determine upon that as soon as possible, in order that I may arrange it. The sentinel at the back door will also be withdrawn, and you will have no difficulty in getting to the bay in the hollow between the house and the avenue. Lead him by the bay towards the garden fence; follow that close until you reach the avenue, and by that time you will be relieved of your company, or never!” The tone of Barsfield's voice rose into fierce emphasis as he uttered the last words, and the triumphant and bitter hope of his malignant heart spoke out no less in the glare of his eye, and the movement of his uplifted arm, than in the language from his lips. He thus continued— “Go now and complete your arrangements with the lady. Come to me then, and tell me what is determined upon. Be prompt, Blonay, and stick to your words, and you shall be properly rewarded.” The Half-Breed promised him freely enough, and left him instantly to do as he was directed. The soul of the tory spoke out more freely when he was alone. “Ay, you shall be rewarded, but with a fate like his. I should be a poor fool, indeed, to leave such a secret in custody like yours.” He little knew that the keen thought of the stolid-seeming Blonay had seen through his design, and meditated a treachery less foul, as it had its cause and provocation. “He cannot escape me now!” said Barsfield to himself, as he paced to and fro among the trees where he had spoken with Blonay. “Not even Tarleton shall now pluck him from my grasp. His doom is written— and she—she, too, shall not live for another, who scorns to live for me! I punish her when I put my foot on him. This mockery of a trial, which Tarleton has devised to effect his escape, deludes not me. I see through him. He would clear him—he aims at my ruin—I see through the drift of this order. His own testimony would be brought to bear in behalf of my enemy, and I should only be cited to prove that which he would find others to disprove. I shall disappoint his malice. Mellichampe, by his own precipitation, shall disappoint him. His benevolent plan to take my enemy from my grasp shall be defeated, and I shall yet triumph in his heart's best blood. Had he not been my enemy, he would not have troubled himself with such unusual and unbecoming charity. No! he must glut his own passion for revenge and blood whenever his humour prompts him, and deny to all others a like enjoyment. He shall not deny me— not in this! The doom of Mellichampe is written—his hours are numbered—and, unless hell itself conspires against me, he can escape me no longer!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX Blonay soon made his communication to Janet, and bore his intelligence back to Barsfield. “To-morrow night, then, is resolved upon?” “Midnight,” replied the scout, telling the truth, which he could not otherwise avoid, as the sentinel was to be withdrawn from the gallery only at the time when Mellichampe was prepared to sally forth. Had it been possible to conceal the fact, Blonay would not have exposed it. “He lives till then!” was the fierce but suppressed exclamation of the tory. “Where do you go now, Mr. Blonay?” he inquired, seeing the Half-Breed about to move away. “Well, cappin, I'm jist guine to give a look after my own man, seeing that I've been working hard enough after your'n.” “You are for the swamp, then?” “Well, yes!” “Remember not to delay—without your presence the prisoner will hardly venture on a start.” “I'll be mighty quick this time.” “And let me know all that you can about the `fox.' See to his force, for I shall soon be ready to take a drive after him.” The Half-Breed promised, and soon set out on his journey, while Barsfield proceeded exultingly to arrange his murderous projects. That night Janet Berkeley conveyed to Mellichampe the particulars of her farther progress. “Well, dearest, does he give the route we are to take? Have you got that?” was the first inquiry of the youth. She repeated the words of Blonay, which detailed the route in the very language of the tory. “This is most important. As we have that, we now know what to do. We can countermine his projects, I trust. We can prepare an offset for his ambush which will astound him. The villain!—along the bay, by the fence, and towards the mouth of the avenue—his ambush is there—there, then, must the struggle come on. Well —well—it must be so. There is no retreat now, Janet—there is no help else!” “Oh, Mellichampe—there is retreat—there must be retreat, if you really think the ambush lies in that quarter. You must take another path, or—” “No, no, Janet—no. Think you, if he designs to murder me, that he will not watch my flight? Every step which I take from these apartments will be with the eyes of his creatures upon me.” “Then go not—since you will only go to death.” “I will go, Janet—I must. It is my hope, and out of his malice I hope to make my security. Hear me, and understand his plan. He will assist me forth from his encampment until I reach its utmost limit, and he will then set upon me. To slay me within its boundary Vol. II.—G 13 would be to incur the suspicion of foul play on the part of his superiors. He only seeks to avoid that—that is all; and once having me beyond his bounds, and, as it were, beyond his responsibility, he will then have no scruple to slay me, as he will then have his ready reply to any charge of foul practice. What will it be then but the shooting down a prisoner seeking to escape—that prisoner under charges, too, of being a spy, and notoriously hostile to his master and his cause?” “And yet, dearest Ernest, you will adventure this flight even with this apprehension, and so perfect a consciousness of it in your mind?” “Even so, Janet—even so. I think he may be foiled. Next to knowing the game of your enemy is the facility of beating him at the play. I think to overmatch him now, if my friends serve me, as I think they will, and if they are still in the neighbourhood. We must lay ambush against ambush—we must oppose armed men to armed men, and then, God forget us if we play it not out bravely.” “But suppose, dear Ernest, that Scipio finds not the men, or any of them?” “I can then defer the flight, Janet; but he will find them—they are even now about us, and so bent to serve me is Witherspoon, that I make no doubt they would attempt to rescue me from the clutches of the tory if I were even under strong guard on my way to Charleston. They know my danger, and will look to it. Witherspoon must be in the neighbourhood—I am sure of it, and— ha! hear you not, my love—even as I speak, hear you not that whistle?—far off, slight, but yet distinct enough. Hear it now again, and again. You will always hear it thrice distinctly, and, if you were nigh, you could distinguish a slight quivering sound, with which it diminishes and terminates. That's one of our signals of encouragement, and to my mind it conveys, as distinctly as any language, the words—`Friends are nigh—friends are nigh!' We have a song among us to that effect, which I have hummed over to myself a hundred times since I have been here—it promises so sweetly to one in my condition— “`Friends are nigh! despair not, In the tyrant's chain— They may fly, but fear not, They'll return again. “`Not more true the season Brings the buds and flowers, Than, through blight and treason, Come these friends of ours.' “I believe the assurance. That song has strengthened me—that single whistle note—and hear, Janet—hear how it comes again, closer and closer, stronger and clearer. That Witherspoon is a daring fellow, and cannot be far from the avenue. No doubt he is even now gazing down from some tree upon the unconscious sentinels. If so, I am safe. He has seen all their positions—all their movements—and has an eye and a head that will enable him to note and take advantage of even the smallest circumstance. You will see!” “Then hurry, dear Ernest, that Scipio may find him even now in the neighbourhood. Write—write.” She stood beside him while he pencilled a scrawl for the courier negro, and gave it into her hand. “One thing, Janet,” he exclaimed, as she was about to leave him. She returned. He whispered in her ear— “Let him bring me weapons—some weapon—any weapon—which may take life, and which he may conceal about him.” She said nothing of her directions to Blonay on this very subject. He mistook her silence, and his words were intended to reassure her. “I must not be unarmed, my Janet, if possible. I must have something with which to defend myself, or the veriest trumpeter in the troop may destroy me at odds with his own instrument.” G 2 The youth wrote briefly his directions to Witherspoon —described his situation—his prospect of escape—the route which he was to take, and the dangers which attended it. This done, Janet immediately sought out Scipio, in whose skill, courage, and fidelity Mellichampe placed the utmost confidence. Before giving him his instructions, she strove, in the most earnest language, to impress upon him the necessity of the utmost caution. Of this there was little need. Scipio was a negro among a thousand; one of those adroit agents who quickly understand and readily meet emergencies; one who never could be thrown from his guard by any surprise, and who, in the practice of the utmost dissimulation, yet wore upon his countenance all the expression of candour and simplicity. Add to this, that he loved his master and his master's daughter with a fondness which would have maintained him faithful, through torture, to his trust, and we have the character of the messenger which the urgencies of his situation had determined Mellichampe to employ. The difficulties in the way of Scipio were neither few nor inconsiderable. He was first to make his way, without search or interruption, beyond the line of sentinels which Barsfield had thrown around the family enclosure. These sentinels were closely placed, almost within speaking distance from each other, within sight at frequent intervals while going their rounds, and changed frequently. Succeeding in this, the negro was to go forward to the adjoining woods, and make his way on until he happened upon Witherspoon, who was supposed by Mellichampe to be in the neighbourhood, or some other of the men of Marion, who could be intrusted to convey safely the paper which he carried, and which, describing Mellichampe's situation and hopes, suggested the plan and agency necessary for his deliverance. The difficulty, and, indeed, danger of this latter part of Scipio's performance, was even greater than that of passing the tory sentinels, since it was important that his missives should fall into the right hands. To be so far deceived as to place the passwords of Marion's men and camp in other than the true, would be to sacrifice, in all probability, the hardy but little troop of patriots who found refuge in the swamps around. Scipio well understood the importance of his trust, and needed no long exhortation from his mistress on the subject. After hearing her patiently for a while, he at length, with some restiffness, interrupted her in the midst of her exhortations— “Da's enough, misses, I yerry you berry well; you no 'casion say no more 'bout it. Enty I know dem tory? Ef he git any ting out of Scip, he do more dan he fadder and granfadder ebber 'speck for do. He's a mean nigger, Miss Janet, can't trow duss in de eye of dem poor buckrah, for it's only dem poor buckrah dat ebber tun tory. Let um catch Scip bunning daylight. Enty my eye open?—da's 'nough. I hab for pass de sentry —I know dat—dat's one ting, enty, I hab to do fuss?” “Yes, that is first to be done, Scipio, and you know how close they are all around us. I know not how you will succeed.” “Nebber you mind, Miss Jannet; I know dem sentry; whay he guine git gumption for double up Scip in he tumb and forefinger, I wonder? Dat tory ain't born yet for such ting, and I ain't fraid 'em. Well, 'speck I gone through dem sentry—I catch de clean woods, and I can laugh out—wha' den?” “Why, then you must look out for Mr. Witherspoon.” “Misser Wedderspoon,—why you no call him Tumbscrew, like udder people? Well, I hab look for him; 'spose I no find 'em—wha' den?” “You must look out, then, for some other of Marion's men; and this, Scipio, is the difficulty.” “Wha' make him difficulty more nor tudder, I wonder?” responded the confident negro. 13* “Because, Scipio, if the passwords get into the possession of any of the British or tories—if you happen to mistake and—” “Gor-a'mighty, Miss Janet, you only now for mak' 'quaintan' wid Scipio? You tink I fool,—blind like ground-mole, and rooting 'long in de ploughed ground widout looking wedder I guine straight or crooked? You 'spose I don't know tory from gentleman? I hab sign and mark for know 'em, jist de same as I know Mass Ernest brand on he cattle from old mossa's.” “Well, Scipio, I trust in your knowledge and your love for me.” “Da's a misses—da's a trute, misses, what I say— I 'speck if ebberybody bin lub you like Scip and Mass Mellichampe, you git more lub in dis life dan you can ebber carry wid you to Heabben. He keep you down from Heabben—da's a God's trute, misses—so much lub as you git on dis airt'. But dis is all noting but talk and cabbage. You mus' hab meat and sarbice— I know dat. I guine—I ready whenebber you tell me; but s'pose, when I gone, old mossa call for me. He will call for me, I know dat; he can't do widout me; and he bery bex if you no talk to um and tell um Scip gone upon transactions and engagements, young misses.” “Don't let that trouble you, Scip; I will speak to my father when you are going; but it is not time for you to go yet; something more is to be done, and we must wait until night before you can set forth.” “Berry well; whenebber you say de word, misses, Scip is ready.” The faithful negro took readily the instructions given him in their fullest scope. He comprehended, so far as it was thought advisable to trust him with the scheme, the nature of the proposed adventure. He was fully informed on all the part he himself was required to play, and was prepared to communicate freely to the woodman. Advising and imploring to the last, the maiden dismissed him from her presence to put himself in readiness for his nocturnal journey, with a spirit full of trembling, and many an inaudible but fervent prayer, from the bottom of her heart, to Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Blonay, as we have seen, had proceeded, after leaving the tory captain, upon his old mission as the avenger of blood. Night after night, day after day, he had gone upon the track of his enemy, and, as yet, without success. But this did not lessen his activity and hope; and we find him again, with undiminished industry, treading the old thicket which led to the camp of Marion. Let us also proceed in the same direction, and penetrate the gloomy swamp and dense woodland recess which sheltered the little army of the lurking partisan. The pomp and circumstance of war—the martial music—the gorgeous uniform—the bright armour of a systematic array of military power, were there almost entirely wanting. The movements of the partisan were conducted without beat of drum or bray of trumpet. In the silent goings on of the night his movements were effected. Mysterious shadows paced the woods amid kindred shadows; and, like so many ghosts trooping forth from unhallowed graves, the men of Marion sallied out in the hour of intensest gloom, for the terror of that many-armed tyrant who was overshadowing the land with his legions. Never was a warfare so completely one of art and stratagem as that which Marion carried on. Quick in the perception of all natural advantages which his native country presented for such a warfare, he was not less prompt in availing himself of their use and application. Hardy and able to endure every privation and all fatigue, he taught his men to dwell in regions where the citizen must have perished, and to move with an alacrity which the slower tactics of European warfare could never have conceived of. In his camp the men soon learned to convert their very necessities into sources of knowledge and of independence. The bitter of the acorn soon ceased to offend their appetites and tastes. The difficulties of their progress through bushes and briers soon taught them a hardiness and capacity to endure, which led them, after no long period of initiation, to delight in all the necessities of their situation, and to rejoice at the sudden whisper which, at midnight, aroused them from their slumbers under the green-wood tree, to sally forth by moonlight to dart upon the new-forming camp of the marauding tory or unsuspecting Briton. It was the morning of that day on which Blonay had made his communication to Barsfield, announcing the acceptance by Janet Berkeley of his offer to aid in the escape of Mellichampe. The camp of the “swamp fox” lay in the stillest repose. The spacious amphitheatre was filled up with the forms of slumbering men. The saddle of the trooper formed a pillow, convenient for transfer to the back of the noble steed that stood fastened in the shelter of another tree close behind him, the bridle being above him in the branches. The watchful sentinel paced his round slowly on the edge of the swamp, looking silently and thoughtful in the deep turbid waters of the river. No word, no whisper, broke the general stillness,—and the moments were speeding fast on their progress which should usher in the dawn. At length the stillness was broken. The tramp of a steed beat heavily upon the miry ooze which girdled the island, and, soon following, the clear challenge of the sentry arrested the progress of the approaching horseman. “Who goes there?” was the prompt demand. The answer was given. “Dorchester!” The scout entered the lines and proceeded on foot to the little clump of trees which had been devoted to Marion. The new-comer made but little noise; yet, accustomed to continual alarms, and sleeping, as it was the boast of Marion's men, with an ear ever open and one foot always in stirrup, the sound was quite sufficient to raise many a head from its pillow, and to persuade many an eye to strain through the gloom and shadow of all objects around, to catch a glimpse of the person, and, if possible, guess the object of his visit. Here and there a whisper of inquiry assailed him as he passed along; and, half asleep and half awake, but still thoughtful of one leading topic of most interest with him, one well-known voice grumbled forth an inquiry after the provision-wagons, and growled himself to sleep again as he received no reply. A full half hour, perhaps, had elapsed before the visiter came forth from the presence of Marion to the spot of general encampment. Thence he proceeded to a tree that stood by itself on the verge of the island, where he found a group of three persons huddled up together, and still engaged in a slumber which seemed silent enough with all, though scarcely very deep or perfect with any. One of the three started up as the person approached, and hastily demanded the name of the intruder. The voice of the inquirer was that of Thumbscrew, and his gigantic frame was soon uplifted as the respondent announced himself as Humphries. “Come with me, Witherspoon—I want you,” said the trooper. “Wait a bit, till I pull up my suspenders, and find my frog-sticker, which has somehow tumbled out of the belt,” was the reply. G 3 A few moments sufficed to enable him to effect both objects, and the two emerged from the shelter of the tree together. Day was dawning as they gained the skirts of the island where Humphries had fastened his horse, and where they were, in great part, free from the observation of their comrades, who were now starting up from their slumbers on every side. When they had reached this point, Humphries, without farther preliminary, unfolded his business to his companion. “Thumby—old fellow—I'm hunted, and need your help.” “Hunted—how—by whom?” “By a scoundrel that seeks my life—a fellow from Dorchester, named Blonay.” “Blonay—Blonay:—I never heard that name before.” “Goggle, then—that's the nickname that he goes by. You've heard John Davis speak of him. I happened to ride over his old mother the time of that brush at Dorchester, when Major Singleton got Colonel Walton out of the cart, and he's been hunting me ever since.” “The d—l! But how could he find you out—how could he track you so?” “That's the wonder; but the fellow's got Indian blood in him, and there's no telling where he can't go. He's as keen upon trail as a blood-hound.” “Have you seen him?—How do you know he's on trail?” “I haven't seen him; but I know he's been after me for some time.” And Humphries then reminded the inquirer of the pursuit of Blonay from the very skirts of the camp, when, to save himself, the Half-Breed slew his own dog, which had led to his detection, and so nearly to his capture. “And why do you think that he's still after you? Don't you think the run that you give him then has pretty nigh cured him of his hunt?” “No, no! The scoundrel will never give up the hunt till he can see my blood or I draw his. There's no help for it,—he will hunt me until I set seriously to hunt him.” “And you have heard of him lately, Bill?” “Ay—heard of him—felt him! Look here.” And, as he spoke, lifting the cap from his head, he showed his comrade the spot through which the passage of the bullet was visible enough. Then, putting aside the hair from his forehead, he placed the finger of Witherspoon upon the scull, along which the ball had made its way. The skin was razed and irritated into a whelk, such as a severe stroke of a whip might occasion upon the skin. An eighth of an inch lower, and the lead would have gone through the brain. “By the eternal scratch!” exclaimed Witherspoon, as he felt and saw the singular effect which the shot had produced, “that, I may say, was a most ticklish sort of a trouble. It was mighty close scraping, Bill; and the fellow seems to have been in good arnest when he pulled, though it's a God's marcy he took you to have more head high up than o' one side. Had he put it here now, to the right or to the left, I don't care which, and not so immediately and ambitiously up in the centre, he would have mollified your fixings in mighty short order, and the way you'd have tumbled over would be a warning to tall men like myself.” Humphries winced as much from the remarks of Witherspoon as under the heavy pressure of his finger, which rambled over the wounded spot upon his head with the proverbial callousness of a regular army surgeon's. “'Tis just as you say, Thumby,” replied the other, with much good-humour,—“a mighty close scrape, and ticklishly nigh: but a miss is good as a mile; and though this shot can't be considered a miss exactly, yet, as no harm's done, it may very well be counted such. The matter now is, how to prevent another chance, and this question leads to a difficulty. How did the fellow come to take track upon me so keenly from the jump? and how has he contrived to keep on it so truly until now? These are questions that ain't so easy to answer, and we must find out their answer before we can fall on any way to circumvent the varmint. I thought at first that he might have got information from some of Barsfield's tories; but since we've been in the swamp they can't take track upon us, and only he has done it; for the general now knows that it was this same skunk that showed the back track of the swamp to Tarleton, and that he most certainly found out only by following after me. I've been thinking over all these matters for a spell now of more than ten days, and I can make little or nothing out of it; and, to say truth, Thumby, it's no little trouble to a man to know there's a hound always hunting after him, go where he will—in swamp or in thicket—on the high road and everywhere —that never goes aside—thirsting after his blood, and trying all sort of contrivances to git at it.” “It's mighty ugly, that's clear,” said his companion, musing. “Yet, this trouble I've known ever since we chased the fellow along the back track, when he cut the throat of his dog, which only an Indian would do, to put us off his own trail.” “It's an ugly business, that's a truth, Humphries; for, not to know where one's enemy is, is to look for a bullet out of every bush. It can't be that some of our men have been playing double, and have let this fellow on track?” “No, there's no reason to think it, for none of them have been always able to find me when they wanted to, and we know where to look for them always.” “It's mighty strange and hard—and what are you to do, Bill?” “You must tell me—I know not what to do,” was the desponding answer: “I've no chance for my life at this rate, for, soon or late, the fellow must git his shot. He'll never give up hunting me till he does. It's the nature of the beast, and there's no hope for me until I can put upon his trail, and hunt him just as he hunts me. The best scout will then win the game and clear the stakes.” “It's mighty sartin, Bill, that he's got some string on you in partic'lar: you've kept too much on the same track.” “No—from the moment I found that the fellow was after me in the swamp, I've been changing every day.” “And still he keeps after you?” “His bullet tells that.” “It's mighty strange. Have you had your nag's hoofs trimmed lately?” “No, they don't need it,—they're shod.” “Shod!” “Yes, in the forefeet.” “Well, now, it's mighty foolish to shoe a horse that's got to travel only in swamp and sand; but I'd like to look at them shoes.” “Come, then.” As they walked, they conversed farther on the same subject. “Where was them shoes put on?” inquired Thumbscrew. “In Dorchester, about three months ago.” “And where was this Ingen fellow then?” “I don't know; somewhere about, I reckon.” “Show me the critter: I'm dubous all the mischief lies in them shoes.” And, following Humphries, Thumbscrew went forward to the spot where the horse was tethered. “Lead him off, Bill—there, over that soft track—jist few paces. That'll do.” The busy eye of Witherspoon soon caught the little 14 ridges left by the crack in the shoe, which had so well conducted the pursuit of Blonay. “I guessed as much, Bill, and the murder's out,— you've given the fellow a sign, and he's kept trail like a trukey. Look here—and here—and here,—a better mark would not be wanted by a blind man, since his own finger could feel it, even if his eyes couldn't see. There it is, and what more do you want?” Humphries was satisfied, no less than his companion. They had indeed discovered the true guide of Blonay in his successful pursuit, so far, of his destined victim. Nothing, indeed, could be more distinct than the impression left upon the sand—an impression not only remarkable as it was so unusual, but remarkable as it occurred upon a small shoe, and seemed intentionally made to divide it—the fissure forming the ridge making a line as clearly distinct upon the shoe, as that made by the shoe itself in its entire outline upon the pliable sand. “Well,” said Thumbscrew, after they had surveyed it for several minutes, “and what are you going to do now?” “That's what I'm thinking of, Thumby, and it's no easy matter yet to determine upon.” “How!—why, what have you to do now but to pull off the shoe, and throw the fellow from your haunches, which you must do the moment you take him off his track.” “No, no,” coolly responded the other, “that will be making bad worse, Thumby, since to throw him off one track will be only to make him hunt out for another, which we may not so readily discover. A fellow that really hungers after your blood, as this fellow does after mine, ain't so easily to be thrown off as you think. To throw off this scent would be only to gain a little time, and botch up the business that we had better mend. The shoes must stay on, old fellow; and, as we've found out that they are the guides which he follows, why, what hinders that we should make use of them to trap him?” “How?” said Witherspoon, curiously. “Easy enough, Thumby, if I've got a friend in the world who's willing to risk a little trouble, and perhaps a scuffle, to help me out of the hound's teeth.” “Gimini! Bill Humphries, you don't mean to say that you ain't been my friend, and that I ain't yours? Say the word, old fellow, and show your hand, and if I ain't your partner in the worst game of old-sledge you ever played, with all trumps agin you, and a hard log to set on, and a bad fire-light to play by, then don't speak of me ever again when your talk happens to run on Christian people. Say the word, old fellow, and I'm ready to help you. How is it to be done?—what am I to do?” “Take my track also,—follow the shoe,—but take care to give me a good start. I will ride on the very route where I got the bullet.” “What! to get another?” “No. I will ride in company, and Blonay is quite too cunning to risk a shot, with the chance of having his own head hammered the next minute by my companion, even if he tumbles me.” “I see! I see! He will be on your track, and will follow you, as he has done before, in hope to get another chance. That's it, eh?” “Yes—he will not be easily satisfied. Nothing but his blood or mine will satisfy any such varmint as this Half-Breed, who takes after the savages, from whom he comes half way. He will be on the old ground which he's travelled so long, and that I've travelled; and he will keep close about me, day by day, and month after month, and year after year, until he gets his chance for a sure shot, and then the game's up,—and he'll not rest quietly before. I know it's the nature of the beast, and so I'm sure of my plan if you only follow it up as I show you, and as I know you're able to do easy enough.” “I'm ready, by gum, Bill. You sha'n't want a true heart and a stiff hand in the play on your side, so long as Thumbscrew can help a friend and hurt an enemy. I'm ready—say the word—the when and the how— and here's your man.” “Thank'ee, Thumby—I knew I shouldn't have to ax twice—and so now listen to me.” “Crack away.” “I set off in two hours for the skirts of Barsfield's camp, where I'm to put a few owls who shall roost above him. After that I take the back track into the swamp, and John Davis and young Lance will keep along with me. I pretty much guess that this fellow Blonay will not let half an hour go by, after I've passed him, before he gets upon trail somewhere or other, and fastens himself up in some bush or hummock, waiting a chance at me when he finds I'm going back. If my calculation be the right one, then all you've got to do is to take the trail after me, keeping a close look-out, right and left, for the fresh track of an Indian pony. If you see that little bullet-foot of a swamp-tacky freshly put down in the swamp or sand after mine, be sure the skunk's started.” “I see—I see.” “Well, when you've once got his track, we have him. If he finds he's got some one on his skirts, he'll go aside, and you'll lose his trail, to be sure: but you'll know then he's either on one side or 'tother in the woods about you; and all you've got to do is to ride ahead a bit and go into the bush too.” “Good, by Gimini!” “What then? Soon as he finds all things quiet, he'll come out of the bush and take up my trail as he did before; and, if you git a good place to hide in, so as to be concealed and yet to watch the road, you can't help seeing when he goes ahead.” “That's true; but suppose he goes into the bush again—what must I do then?” “Just what you've done before—the very thing—until he gets to the bayou that opens the door to the swamp. If you can track him that far, you can track him farther; for when he once gets there he'll be sure to go into hiding in some corner or other where he knows I must pass, waiting the chance to crack at me again.” “Yes—yes! And I'm to try and find out his hollow? I see, I see. It ain't so hard, after all, for I'm a very bear in the swamp, and can go through a cane-brake with the best of them. We shall have the skunk, Bill,— there's no two ways about it. If he can keep the track of a horseshoe through mud and mire for a month, hunting an enemy, 'twont be very hard for me to keep it too, helping a friend: and though, between us, Bill— I'm mighty conflustered about Airnest, and that d—d tory Barsfield, and what to do to help the lad out of his hobbles, yet I'm not guine to let this matter stand in the way of yours. I'll go neck and shoulders for you, old fellow, and here's a rough fist on it.” A hearty gripe testified the readiness of the one to assist his friend, and the warm acknowledgments of the other. The two then proceeded to make their arrangements for the prosecution of a scheme so truly partisan. In this affair it may be proper that we should attend them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">14* CHAPTER XXI. The Half-Breed that morning had taken a stand upon the roadside to which he had been long accustomed. The route was one frequently trodden by his enemy. This fact Blonay had ascertained at an early period in his pursuit, and here, day after day, had he watched with a degree of patient quietude only to be comprehended by a reference to the peculiar blood which was in him. The instincts of the Indian character were his instincts. Hardily to endure, stubbornly to resist, perseveringly to prosecute his purpose—that purpose being a revenge of wrong and indignity,—all these seemed to have been born within him at his birth, and to have acquired a strength corresponding with that of his continued growth and accumulating vigour. Such instincts are scarcely to be controlled even by education,—the education which he had received had only made them more active and tenacious. The Half-Breed had little hope, on the present occasion, to meet again with his enemy. The attempt which he had recently made on the life of Humphries, and which he thought to have entirely failed, would, he believed, have so alarmed the trooper as to have impelled him to seek another route, or, at least, have prompted him to the precaution of taking companions with him when he again rode forth. It was with a faint hope, therefore, that he now resumed his place. On the ensuing night he was to effect the escape of Mellichampe, the successful prosecution of which attempt would, he doubted not, result in raising for him a new enemy in the person of the tory captain. About the issue of this adventure he had various misgivings. He questioned the practicability of success, as he knew nothing of the design of Mellichampe, and of the despatch which had been sent by Scipio. He was certain that Mellichampe would be slain, but he concurred in the supposed preference which the youth gave to the mode of dying, in the stroke or shot of sudden combat, rather than by the degrading cord. He was pledged to serve the maiden, and to comply with her wishes was the best mode in his estimation. He had concealed his pony, and covered himself by the thick umbrage around him, in his old retreat, when the sound of approaching horses called for his attention. With a feeling of gratified surprise he saw his enemy. But he was accompanied: John Davis rode on one side of Humphries, and Lance Frampton on the other,—all well mounted, and carrying their rifles. “How easy to shoot him now,” thought the Half-Breed,—“I couldn't miss him now—but it's no use:” and his rifle lay unlifted across his arm, and he suffered the three to pass by him in safety. To forbear was mortifying enough. They rode by within twenty yards, seemingly in the greatest glee, laughing and talking. A less cool and wary enemy than Blonay, having a similar pursuit, could not have forborne. The temptation was a trying one to him; but, when he looked about in the woods around him, and saw how easily they might be penetrated by the survivers, even if he shot Humphries, he felt convinced that the death of his enemy would be the immediate signal for his own. His revenge was too much a matter of calculation—too systematic in all its impulses —to permit him to do an act so manifestly disparaging his Indian blood, and his own desire for life, and his habitual caution. The cover in which he stood, though complete enough for his concealment while it remained unsuspected, was otherwise no shelter; and, subduing his desire, he quietly and breathlessly kept his position, until his ears no longer distinguished the tramp of their departing horses. It was then that the Half-Breed rose from his place of shelter. Gliding back to the deeper recess where his pony had been hidden, he was soon mounted, and prepared to take the track after his enemy. “He's gone to place the sentries and send out the scouts. He won't have 'em with him by the time he gits to the swamp, and I'll take the short track at the bend and git there before him. Adrat it, that I should have missed him as I did!” Thus muttering, he left the woods, and was soon pacing, with the utmost caution, upon the road which had been taken by his enemy. Marking his time duly, and heedful of every object upon the road, our friend Witherspoon might have been seen, a little while after, going over the same ground with no little solemnity. He had carefully noted the several tracks made by the horse of Humphries, along with those of his companions, and, step by step, had kept on their trail until he reached the spot at which, emerging from the place of his concealment, the waylaying Blonay had set off also in pursuit. The observant eye of Witherspoon, accustomed to note every sign of this description, soon detected the track made by the hoof of the animal which Blonay bestrode. He alighted from his horse, and carefully examined it; then, entering the woods on that side from which the pony had evidently emerged, he traced out the course of the Half-Breed by the crushed grass and disordered foliage, until he found, not only where the pony had been kept, but the very branch to which he had been tethered. The branch was broken at the end, and the bridle, having been passed over it, by its friction, had chafed a little ring around the bark. From this spot he passed to that in which Blonay himself had been hidden on the roadside when Humphries had ridden by. His exclamation, as he made this discovery, was natural and involuntary— “Gimini, if Bill had only know'd it, how he could have wound up the animal! Only to think—here he squatted, not twenty steps off, and a single leap of a good nag would ha' put a hoof on each of his shoulders! But it ain't all a clear track for him yet. Push is the word; and, if he don't keep wide awake, he'll larn more in the next two hours than he'll ever understand in a week after. Come, Button, we'll know this place next time in case we have to look after the Indian agen.” He resumed his course, and with something more of rapidity, as he now discovered that the game was fairly afoot. The track was distinctly defined for him; and, wherever the foot of Humphries' horse had been set down, there, with unerring certainty, immediately behind, was that of the pony. Excited by the prospect of the encounter which he now promised himself, he began unconsciously to accelerate the movements of his horse, until he gained rapidly, without knowing it himself, upon the footsteps of the rider he pursued. Blonay had not, however, laid aside his habitual wariness, and the precipitancy of Witherspoon betrayed his approach to the watchful senses of the Half-Breed. He had himself gained so much upon Humphries as to hear the sounds of his horse's tread, and his quick ear soon detected the corresponding sound from the feet of Witherspoon's horse in the rear. He paused instantly, until assured that his senses had not deceived him, and silently then he slid into the bushes on one side of the road, availing himself of a deep thicket which spread along to the right. Nor, having done this, did he pause in a single spot and simply seek concealment. He took a backward course for a hundred yards or more, and awaited there in shelter, watching a single opening upon the road, which he knew must be darkened by the figure of the approaching person. Witherspoon rode on, passed the designated spot, and was recognised by the outlier. But, as it was not the policy of Blonay to be discovered now by any, he did not come forth and remind our friend of their former meeting on the highway. The partisan kept on his way until he missed the track of the pony. There was that of Humphries plainly enough; but that of the pony was no longer perceptible. He checked his own steed, and rebuked himself for his want of caution. He saw that he must now change his game; and, without stopping to make an examination which might startle Blonay into suspicion,—for he knew not but that the Half-Breed was even then looking down upon him from some place of safe concealment,—he rode on a short distance farther, and then sank, like Blonay, into the cover of the very same woods, though on the side opposite to that which had given shelter to the latter. Here he dismounted, hid his horse in a recess sufficiently far in the rear to prevent any sounds which he might utter from reaching any ear upon the road, and, advancing to a point sufficiently nigh to command a view of passing objects, sought a place of concealment and watch for himself. This he soon found, and, like a practised scout, he patiently concentrated all his faculties upon the task he had undertaken, and, with all the energies of his mind, not less than of his body, prepared for the leap which he might be required to take, he lay crouching in momentary expectation of his prey. Here he waited patiently, for the space of half an hour, in the hope of seeing the pursuer go by. But he waited in vain: the road remained undarkened by a solitary shadow—his ears were unassailed by a solitary sound. The Half-Breed well knew what he was about. Familiar with the course usually taken by Humphries, he did not now care to tread directly upon his footsteps, particularly as such a progress must have placed him upon the same road with that taken by the stranger, whose unlooked-for coming had driven him into shelter. It was enough that he could reach, a mile above, the narrow track which, darting aside from the main road, led obliquely into the swamp. There he knew he should again come upon the track of Humphries, and with that hope he was satisfied. Keeping the woods, therefore, on the side which he had entered, he stole along among the shadows of the silent pines sufficiently far to be both unseen and unheard by those upon the road; and while the scout lay snugly watching for him in the bush, the subtle Half-Breed had gone ahead of him, and was now somewhat in advance, though still moving slowly between him and Humphries. Witherspoon was soon convinced that this must be the case, and, throwing aside his sluggishness, he prepared to resume his progress. “The skunk will double round us, after all,” he muttered to himself, “if I don't keep a better look-out. But he sha'n't. There's only one way. It won't do to go on sich a trail on the back of a nag that puts down his foot like an elephant. Shank's mare is the only nag for this hunt, and you must keep quiet where you are, Button, till I get back. I can do well enough for a while without you, and you must be reasonable, and be quiet, too.” Thus addressing his horse, he tightened the rope which fastened him to the tree, and prepared to continue the pursuit on foot. “I can walk jist as fast as that 'ere pony can trot, at any time, and the skunk that straddles him is too cunning to go fast now. I can outwalk him, I know; and, if he could hear Button's big foot, it's more than his ears can do to hear mine.” Thus reasoning, the scout left his steed, pressed forward upon the highway, and with rapid strides pushed for the recovery of lost ground. Blonay, meanwhile, had gained a sight of the person he pursued. Humphries had lingered behind with this very object. As soon as the Half-Breed heard the sounds of feet above him, and so near the swamp, he sank into the deepest cover and began to prepare himself. He first alighted from his pony, which he led as far into the shelter of the woods as seemed advisable. His own concealment was more easily effected while on foot than when mounted, and the proximity of his enemy rendered every precaution necessary. The sudden rush of a fleet steed, like that bestrode by Humphries, would have brought the latter upon him long before he could conceal himself, if he happened to be mounted at the time. On foot he pressed forward until he beheld the three and distinguished their movements. Humphries was in the rear, Davis and Frampton were about to enter the swamp, and, indeed, had already done so. It was then that Blonay urged the pursuit most rapidly; and, with rifle ready to be lifted to his shoulder the moment the opportunity should offer for its use, he leaped cautiously, in a circuitous route, from cover to cover, and in the greatest silence, in order to secure a position which might command the pond, through which he well knew the partisans must go before entering the swamp. He was the more stimulated in this object as he thought it not improbable that, as the companions of Humphries were ahead of him, they might go so far forward as to throw the entire length of the pond, and the intervening thicket (which, thrusting itself up from one side of it, and running far out into its centre, almost entirely concealed its opposite termination), between themselves and the enemy he pursued. If this had been the case, his opportunity to shoot down Humphries, and make his escape before the other two could possibly return, would be complete. All these conjectures and calculations were instantaneous, and the result of his natural instinct. The image of his success rose vividly before him as he pressed forward to secure a fair shot at the figure of which he momently caught glimpses through the foliage; and, but for the heedful thought of Humphries,—with whom the present was the life and thought-absorbing affair,—the opportunity might have been won by the vindictive pursuer who desired it. The partisan was sufficiently observant, however, of all these chances. He knew not that his enemy was at hand, and, indeed, did not think it; but he omitted no precaution, and clung close to his companions. They moved forward together into the pond; and, when Blonay reached the edge of it, they had emerged through its waters, and, gaining the opposite side, were out of his reach and sight, and in safety for the present. Blonay was a patient enemy—no less patient than persevering. He sank back into cover, and prepared to wait, as he had often done before, for the return of his victim. “He goes to place his scouts—he will come back alone,” were the muttered words of the Half-Breed; and, unconscious that he himself was an object of as close a watch as that which he maintained on Humphries, he coolly sought his place of rest behind a little clump of cane and a thicket of close brier, which formed much of the undergrowth among the gigantic cypresses spreading around him, and formed no unfitting fringe for the edge of the swamp. Meanwhile Witherspoon had not been idle or unobservant. He had pushed forward after Blonay with precautions similar to those which the latter had practised; and, with a speed accelerated in accordance with the due increase of confidence arising from the absence of his horse, he had contrived to gain a point of observation which commanded the entrance to the swamp quite as soon as Blonay, and just when Humphries and his companions were about to pass into the pond. At Vol. II.—H 15 first he saw none but the three companions; but, even while he gazed upon them from a place of shelter by the wayside, and at the distance of a few hundred yards, he became conscious, though yet without seeing the object, of the approach of some one on the opposite hand. The three disappeared from his sight, and, as the last sounds reached his ears of the tread of their horses as they plashed through the turbid waters of the creek, he distinctly beheld the person of a man moving hurriedly along its margin. In the next glance he saw that it was the Half-Breed. “I have him—here's at you!” he cried to himself, as he raised his rifle. But, before he could pull trigger, his victim had disappeared. Vexed and mortified, he was compelled to squat down in quiet in order to avoid being seen; and, hiding himself closely behind a bush, he waited and watched for a second opportunity. But this he was not destined to get so readily. While he looked he saw the whole line of cane-brake, on the edge of the lagune, slightly agitated and waving at the tops as if under a sudden gust, but he saw no more of the person he pursued. In a little while he heard the feet of the returning horses once more plunging through the pond; and again did he see the cane-tops waving suddenly in front of a grove of huge cypresses, and as suddenly again subsiding into repose. Witherspoon could see no more of the enemy, and, half bewildered, he awaited the return of Humphries, to unfold to him what he knew and how he had been disappointed. Blonay, meanwhile, though maintaining a solicitous regard to his own concealment, kept a no less heedful watch upon the progress of his enemy. He looked out from his cover upon the return of Humphries; but, as he continued to be still accompanied by Davis and Frampton, there was evidently no opportunity for prosecuting his purpose. He sank back in silence to his place of shelter among the canes and cypresses. Witherspoon had again noted the disturbance among the cane-tops, but he failed to see the intruder. It was with no small mortification that he unfolded to Humphries, as he came, the unsuccessful results of his watch. “He is there, somewhere among the canes; but, d—n the nigger, you might as well look for a needle in a haystack as after him in such a place as that.” “But we will look for him there!” cried Humphries, dashing forward to the designated region. The rest followed him in several directions, completely encircling in their hunt the supposed place of Blonay's concealment. He looked upon their search in composure and with scornful indifference; but he remained quiet all the while. They hunted him with all the passion of hatred, disappointment, and anxiety. They penetrated through brake and through brier,—they tore aside the thickly-wedged masses of cane-twigs and saplings,—traversed bog and water,—pressed through bushes, and encircled trees,—searching narrowly every spot and object in the locality designated by Witherspoon which might conceal a man; but they laboured in vain. They did not find the fugitive. Yet his traces everywhere met their eyes. His footsteps were plainly perceptible on one or two miry banks; but the whole neighbourhood was half covered with water, and the traces which he made were accordingly soon lost. For more than an hour did they continue the search, until they wandered from the spot entirely. The quest was hopeless; and, vexed at his disappointment, Humphries was compelled to give up the pursuit in the performance of other duties. They had scarcely left the ground, however, before Blonay came forth from his place of concealment—the body of a hollow cypress, divided from the cane-brake by a narrow creek, in a portion of which it grew. “Adrat it! they thought to catch a weasel asleep, did they? I reckon it won't do this time. And now, I s'pose—” H 2 The words were interrupted, and the soliloquy discontinued. The fugitive stooped to the earth as if to listen, then immediately hurried back through the shallow water, and into the tree where he had previously hidden himself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. He had barely attained his place of shelter when Humphries returned. He returned alone. He had dismissed his comrades as no longer essential to his search, and had determined upon stealing back to the neighbourhood where the Half-Breed had been last seen, placing himself in a position to watch him, and lingering till the latest possible moment, in the hope to see him emerge. The thoughts of Humphries were of the most annoying description. He reflected bitterly on the chances now before him, not only of his enemy's escape, but of his own continued danger. The whole labour of pursuit and stratagem was again to be taken over; and with this disadvantage, that, as they had now alarmed the Half-Breed, who must have been conscious of their recent pursuit and search, it would be necessary to adopt some new plan of action, and contrive some new scheme, before they could possibly hope to entrap him. In the meantime, to what danger was his threatened victim not exposed, since, while effecting nothing towards his own security, the recent adventure must only contribute to the increased wariness of his enemy. Full of these bitter and distracting thoughts, he took post upon a little hillock, which rose slightly above the miry surface which spread all around him. A huge cypress, rising up from a shallow creek, stood like a forest monarch directly before his eyes. The cane, in which he had pursued so hopeless a search, spread away in a winding line beyond the creek, and upon its slightly waving surface his eyes were fixed in intense survey. “It was there—there he must be still,” he said to himself, as he looked upon its dense enclosure. “He will come out directly, when he thinks me quite gone, and when he can hear nothing. I will wait for him, though I wait till sunset.” He had taken a place of watch which gave him a full view of the cane-brake and the scattered cypresses before it, while his position was concealed, at the same time, by a cluster of bushes, from any one emerging from the region he surveyed. Here, squatting low, he prepared his rifle, having carefully prepared an opening for it through the bushes, whence its muzzle might be projected at a moment's warning; and, with eyes sharpened by a feeling of anxiety little short of desperation, he lay quietly, the agent of a deadly hate and a shuddering fear, watchful for that opportunity which should gratify the one passion and silence all the apprehensions of the other. While he watched in quiet he heard a slight noise immediately at hand. Something reached his ears like the friction of bark. His breathings became suppressed in the intenseness of his anxiety. He felt that his enemy was near him, and his hope grew into a gnawing appetite, which made his whole frame tremble in the nervous desire which it occasioned. The noise was repeated a little more distinctly—distinctly enough, indeed, to indicate the direction from which it came. His glance rested upon the aged cypress which stood immediately before him. “Could he be there?” was his self-made inquiry. The tree stood in the water. The hollow did not seem large enough above the creek to admit the passage of a human body. “Yet it might be so.” He regretted, 15* while he gazed, that they had not examined it; and he regretted this the more as he now saw that the upper edges of the hollow above the creek were still wet, as if they had been splashed by the hurried passage of some large body into the tree. He kept quiet, however, while these thoughts were going through his mind, and determined patiently to wait events. “He must come out at last,” was his muttered thought, “if he is there, and I can wait, I reckon, jist as long as he.” Was it an instinct that prompted him to raise his eyes at this moment, from the hollow at the foot of the cypress to the shaft of the tree, as it stretched away above? He did so; and, in the sudden glance which he gave, the glare of a wide and well-known eye met his own, staring around, from a narrow and natural fissure in the stupendous column some ten feet from its base. With a howl of positive delight he sprang to his feet, and the drop of the deadly instrument fell upon the aperture. But, before he could spring the lock or draw the trigger, the object had disappeared. The Half-Breed—for it was he—had sunk down the moment Humphries met his eye, and was no more to be seen. But he was there! That was the consolation of his enemy. “He is there—I have him!” he cried aloud. No answer reached him from within. Humphries bounded into the water to the hollow at the bottom of the tree, through which the slender form of Blonay had resolutely compressed itself. He thrust his hand into the opening, and endeavoured, by grasping the legs of the Half-Breed, to drag him down to the aperture; but he failed entirely to do so. A bulging excrescence on the tree—a knob, or knee, as it is called—within, served the beleaguered man as a place of rest; and upon this, firmly planting his feet, no effort of his enemy could possibly dislodge him. To thrust his rifle up the hollow, and shoot as he stood, was the next thought of Humphries; but the first attempt to do this convinced him of the utter impracticability of the design. The opening, though sufficiently large for the entrance of a body so flexible as that of a man, was yet too short to admit of the passage of a straight, unyielding shaft of the rifle's length, unless by burying the instrument in the water to a depth so great as would bring the lock much below it. The difficulty was a novel one, and for a moment the practised woodman was at fault. What was he to do? His enemy was within his reach, yet beyond his control, and might as well be a thousand miles off. To leave the tree, to go in search of his companions, or to procure an axe to fell it, would only be to afford an opportunity for the egress and escape of his victim. This was not to be thought upon. He seized his knife, and though assured that by its use he could do no more than annoy the Half-Breed, situated where he was, and could by no possibility inflict a vital injury, he yet proceeded to employ it. “It may bring him out,” he muttered to himself, “it'll vex and bring him out.” He thrust the weapon up the hollow, and struck right and left at the feet and ankles of the inmate. But with the first graze of the weapon upon his legs Blonay drew them up by contracting his knees—an effort which the immense size of the tree—the hollow of which might have contained three men with ease—readily enabled him to make. Humphries soon saw the fruitlessness of his effort with the knife, and, seemingly, the fruitlessness of any effort which he could then make. In his rage, exasperated at the vicinity of his foe, yet of his seeming safety, he shouted aloud, in the hope to bring back his departed companions. A fiendish chuckle sounded scornfully from within the tree, and seemed to taunt him with his feebleness and fury. He renewed his efforts,— he struck idly with his knife within the hollow, until, burying the blade in one of the projecting knobs, it snapped off short at the handle, and was of no more service. Furious at these repeated failures, and almost exhausted by his efforts, he poured forth curses and denunciations in the utmost profusion upon the unheeding and seemingly indifferent Half-Breed. “Come out like a man,” he cried to him, in an idle challenge; “come out and meet your enemy, and not, like a snake, crawl into your hollow, and lie in waiting for his heel. Come out, you skunk, and you shall have a fair fight, and nobody shall come between us. You shall have your distance jist as you want it, and it shall be the quickest fire that shall make the difference of chances between us. Come out, you spawn of a nigger, and face me, if you're a man.” Thus did he run on in his ineffectual fury, and impotently challenge an enemy who was quite too wary to give up the vantage-ground which he possessed. The same fiendish chuckle which had enraged the trooper so much before, again responded to his challenge from the tree,—again stimulated him to newer efforts, which, like the past, were unavailing. The Half-Breed condescended no other reply. He gave no response whatsoever to the denunciations of his enemy; but, coolly turning himself occasionally in his spacious sheath, he now and then raised himself slightly upon his perch, and placing his mouth abreast of the upper aperture in the tree, gratified himself by an occasional inhalation of the fresh air —a commodity not so readily afforded by his limited accommodations. Humphries, meanwhile, almost exhausted by his own fury not less than by its hopeless labours, had thrown himself upon the bank in front of the opening, watching it with the avidity of an eagle. But Blonay gave him no second chance for a shot while he lay in this position. He watched in vain. Even as he lay, however, a new plan suggested itself to his mind, and one so certain of its effect, that he cursed himself for his stupidity that did not suffer him to think of it before. With the thought, he started to his feet. Detached masses of old and decaying trees, the remains of many a forest of preceding ages, lay freely scattered around him. Here and there a lightwood knot, and here and there the yet undecayed branch, the tribute of some still living pine, to the passing hurricane, lay contiguously at hand. He gathered them up with impetuous rapidity. He collected a pile at the foot of the cypress, and prepared himself for the new experiment. Selecting from this pile one of the largest logs, he thrust it through the water, and into the hollow of the tree, seeking to wedge it between the inner knobs on which the feet of Blonay were evidently resting. But the Half-Breed soon became aware of the new design, which he opposed, as well as he could, with a desperate effort. He saw, and was instantly conscious of, his danger. With his feet he baffled for a long time the efforts of his enemy, until, enraged at length, Humphries seized upon a jagged knot of lightwood, which he thrust against one of the striving legs of the Half-Breed, and employing another heavy knot as a mallet, he drove the wedge forward unrelentingly against the yielding flesh, which was torn and lacerated dreadfully by the sharp edges of the wood. Under the sudden pain of the wound, the feet were drawn up, and the woodman was suffered to proceed in his design. The miserable wretch in the tree, thus doomed to be buried alive, was now willing to come to terms with his enemy. His voice hollowly reached the ears of his exulting captor, as he agreed to accept his terms of fight, if he would suffer him to come down. But the reply of Humphries partook somewhat of the savage nature of his victim. “No, no! you d—d skunk, you shall die in your hole, like a varmint as you are; and the cypress shall be your coffin, as it has been your house.” The voice within muttered something of fight. “It's too late for that,” was the reply. “I gave you H 3 the chance once, and you wouldn't-take it. It's the worse for you, since you don't get another. Here you shall stay, if hard chunks and solid lightwood can keep you, until your yellow flesh rots away from your cursed bones! Here you stay till the lightning rips open your coffin, or the hurricane in September tumbles you into the swamp.” The voice of Blonay was still heard, though more and more feebly, as the hard wood was driven into the hollow—mass wedging mass—until all sounds from within, whether of pleading or defiance, seemed to die away into a plaintive murmur, that came faintly through the thickening barrier, and was almost unheard by Humphries, as, with the knotty lever which he employed, he sent the heavy wedges, already firm enough, more thoroughly into the bosom of the tree. His labour was at length completed. The victim was fastened up securely, beyond his own efforts of escape. He was effectually sealed up, and the seal could only be taken off by a strong hand from without. Where, in that deep forest recess, wild and tangled, could succour find him out? What hope that his feeble voice could reach the ears of any passing mortal? There was no hope but in the mercy of his enemy, and of that the captive and doomed man could have no hope, even if he pleaded for his life—an idea that never once entered into his mind. His doom was written, and the partisan paused before the tree, and his eye rested on the aperture above. The body of the imprisoned man was heard to writhe about in his cell. Humphries stepped back, the better to survey the aperture. In another moment he beheld the blear eyes of his victim peering forth upon him, and, firm and fearless as he was, he shuddered at their expression. Their natural ugliness was enlarged and exaggerated by the intensity of his despair. Before, they had been but disgusting—they were now frightful to the beholder. As he looked upon him, the first feeling of Humphries was to lift his rifle and shoot him; but, as the weapon was elevated, he saw that the Half-Breed no longer shrank from the meditated shot. On the contrary, he seemed now rather to invoke his death, as even a mercy in that preferable form, at the hands of his enemy. But his desire was not complied with. “No, no. Why should I waste the bullet upon you? You took to the hollow like a beast. You shall die like one. It's a fit death for one like you. You've been hunting after my blood quite too long. I won't spill yours, but I'll leave it to dry up in your heart, and you shall feel it freezing and drying up all the time.” He surveyed his victim as he spoke with a malicious joy, which at length grew into a painful sort of delight,— it was so intense—so maddening—so strange,—since it followed a transition from the extremest sense of apprehension to one of unlooked-for security. His ecstasies at length broke forth into tumultuous and unmitigated laughter. The deportment of the Half-Breed was changed. His features seemed to undergo elevation, and the utter hopelessness of his fate, as he now beheld it, even gave dignity to their expression. He spoke to his enemy in language of the most biting asperity. His sarcasm was coarse, but effective, as it accorded with his own nature and the education of his foe. He taunted him with cowardice, with every meanness, and strove to irritate him by reproaches of himself and his connexions—aspersions upon his mother and his sister, in language and assertion, which, among the vulgar, is almost always effectual in irritating to the last degree of human violence. The object of Blonay was to provoke Humphries to the use of the more ready weapon, which would have given him death without the prolonged torture consequent upon such a doom as that to which he was now destined. But the partisan readily divined his object, and denied him the desired boon. “No, no—catch old birds with chaff,” he replied, coolly. “You shall die as you are. I'll just take the liberty of putting a plug into that hollow, which will give you less chance to talk out, as you now seem pleased to do. I'll stop out a little more of the sweet air, so that you may enjoy better what I leave you.” Thus saying, he threw together a few chunks at the foot of the tree, and, rising upon them, well provided with a wedge estimated to fit the aperture, he prepared to drive it in, and placed it at the opening for that purpose. The desperate Blonay thrust one hand through the crevice, in the vain hope to exclude the wedge. But a blow from the lightwood knot with which Humphries had provided himself as a sort of mallet, crushed the extended fingers almost into a mass, and the Half-Breed must have fainted from the pain, as the hand was instantly withdrawn; and, when the partisan drove in the wedge, the face of the victim had sunk below the opening, and was no longer to be seen. His task completed, he descended from his perch, threw aside the chunks which had supported him, and set off to find his horse. He was at last secure from the hunter of blood—he had triumphed —and yet he could not keep down the fancy, which continually, as he went, imbodied the supposed cries of the Half-Breed in little gusts of wind, that seemed to pursue nim; and, when he emerged from the wood, a strange chill went through his bones, and he looked back momently, even when the gigantic cypress, which was the sepulchre of his enemy, no longer reared up its solemn spire in his sight. It was no longer behind him. It seemed to move before him faster than his horse; and he spurred the animal furiously forward, seeking to pass the fast-travelling tree, and to escape the moaning sound which ever came after him upon the breeze.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. The deed was done; and Humphries, fatigued by a long and arduous duty on the previous night, and doubly so from the exciting circumstances just narrated, hurried to his place of retreat and repose in the swamp covert of the partisans. He could sleep now. For a long period his sleep had been troubled and unsatisfactory. His apprehensions were now quieted, and sweet must be that first sleep which we feel to be secure from the efforts of a long-sleepless enemy. His companions, meanwhile, had the duties of the scout to execute, and each had gone upon his several tasks. Witherspoon, with whom our course now lies, true to his friend, proceeded at once to the woods that surrounded the camp of Barsfield. He maintained a close watch upon the premises in which Mellichampe lay a prisoner. How he knew of the youth's predicament may not be said, but certain it is he was informed both as to the nature of his injuries and his condition. He had, probably, lurked in the hollow, or listened from a tree, while an incautious sentinel prattled to his comrade; or, which is not less probable, he had gathered his intelligence from some outlying negro of the plantation, whose address enabled him to steal forth at intervals, in spite of the surrounding sentinels. Solicitous, to the last degree, for the safety of the youth, of whose safety, while in the custody of Barsfield, he half despaired, he availed himself of his duties as a scout to lurk about the neighbourhood, in the faint hope to communicate with, or in some other way to serve, the prisoner. Night after night, for a week before the period to which we have now come, had he cheered the 16 heart and strengthened the hope of Mellichampe with his well-known whistle. It may be scarce necessary to say, that the faithful inferior found no less gratification in this sad office than did the youth to whom it taught the unrelaxing, though as yet ineffectual, watchfulness of a friend. The dexterity of Witherspoon admirably sorted with his fidelity and courage. Fearlessly did he penetrate the nearest points to which he might approach, without certainty of being seen, of the camp of his enemy. The frequent exercise of his faculties as a woodman— a native ease and self-confidence, and a heart too much interested in a single object to feel any scruples, or fear any danger, prompted him to a degree of hardihood which, in a less admirable scout, would have been childish audacity: but it was in him the result of a calm conviction of his own readiness of resource, and of his general ability to meet emergencies. He knew himself as well as his enemy, and relied upon his own sense of superiority. This confidence, however, seduced him into no incautiousness. He timed his movements with a just reference to all the circumstances of his situation, —chose his route and designed his purpose well before entering upon it; and, this done, dashed forward with the boldness of the tiger, and the light, scarce perceptible footstep of the wild turkey in April. It was night when, after making a circuit around Barsfield's position, and scanning it carefully on every side, he reached a copse at the head of the avenue, where, on a previous occasion, we found himself and Mellichampe concealed. It was an old haunt, and he threw himself on the grass and mused listlessly, like one who, after long strifes and a heating exercise abroad, comes home to the repose and permitted freedoms of his own fireside and family. The camp-fires were sprinkled about the woods before him, looking dimly enough in contrast with the pale but brighter gleams of the now ascending moon. The house in which Mellichampe was confined stood a little beyond, but as yet undistinguishable. The scout lay and mused upon the fate and probable fortunes of his friend, and his thoughts, breaking through the bounds of his own restraining consciousness, were framed into words upon his lips without his own volition. “I could swear he answered me last night. There's no mistake. Three times it come upon the wind; first, quick and shrill, to catch the ear—then slow and sad— and then quick and shrill agin. 'Twas a great distance to hear a whistle, but the wind come up jist then, and I'm sure I heard it, and it was sich a blessed sort of music, coming from Airnest, that, by Gracious!—I can't help it—I'll go closer agin, and see if I can't get some more of it. It's a sign he's doing better if he's able to whistle, and it's a clear sign he hears me when he's able to answer. I'll try it agin soon as I see that big fire kindled that burns upon the left, for then I know they'll be busy at the supper. He shall hear me agin, by Gimini!—he shall know I ain't forgotten him, though, to be sure, there's but little can be done for him yet. Them d—d blasted tories are too thick about Barsfield, and the `fox' must wait and watch a little longer before he can make a break. Gimini! it's hard enough, but there's no way to help it.” He soliloquized thus upon a variety of matters, all bearing upon this subject; and, had a scout of the enemy been crouching among the branches of the tree above him, he might have picked up for Barsfield many a vauable little secret touching the condition and the force of Marion. The faithful Witherspoon was one of those ingenuous persons who do not hesitate to speak their thoughts out freely, and who, thinking to himself, is yet quite as likely to be confiding and communicative, as if he was really engaged in delivering a message to his superior. You could have heard from his lips on this occasion, without much striving to hear, what were the general objects of the partisan—how he was busy gathering his men in the swamp for the co-operation, in future strife, with the newly-forming army of Greene,— of designs upon the rapidly-rushing, and, perhaps, too self-confident career of Bannister Tarleton,—and, to come more immediately to the interest before us, he might have learned now, for the first time, as we do, of the organization of an especial corps, to be commanded by Major Singleton, having for its object the rescue of the youthful Mellichampe, whenever it should be ascertained that he was to be removed to Charleston. This was a primary consideration with the partisan. The tender mercies of a Charleston commandant, and of a board of British officers for inquiry, were well known; and the sacrifice of the youth was a fear with all his friends, should he not be rescued from the clutches of his foe before his transfer to the scene of trial. Too hazardous an enterprise to aim at this rescue while the youth lay in Barsfield's well-defended encampment, the partisan simply prepared himself to be in readiness at the moment when a signal from his scouts should apprize him of the movement of any guard of the enemy in the direction of the city. An ambush on the wayside was the frequent resort of warriors who were only too few, too poorly armed and provided, to risk a more daring sort of warfare. The camp of Barsfield was soon illuminated by the additional fire of which Witherspoon had spoken. As soon as he beheld it he proceeded, cautiously but fearlessly, to pass the intervening road; then, keeping close alongside of the left or upward bank of the avenue leading to the settlement, he stole along from tree to tree, until he heard the measured tread of the more advanced sentinels. A necessity for greater precaution induced a pause. He stole, a moment after, to the edge of the ditch, into which he descended; then, crawling upon hands and knees up the bank, he looked over into the avenue, and distinguished the glittering raiment of the first sentinel. In the distance he beheld a second, with corresponding pace, moving his “lonely round.” Resting his chin upon his palm, Witherspoon took a cool survey of the prospect, and did not even withdraw himself into the hollow when the nearest soldier, having gained his limit, wheeled to retrace his steps. “I could nail that fellow's best button now with a sly bullet, if 'twas any use, and he wouldn't know what hurt him,” was the half-muttered thought of the scout as the sentinel approached. The man came forward until he stood abreast of our scout, who buried himself in the long grass as he approached; then, again wheeling, he commenced his monotonous return. It was now the moment for Witherspoon: he gathered himself up instantly, waited in readiness until the sentinel had gone half of his distance, then, with a single bound, leaped down into the avenue, and sought his way across. His tread was light—wonderfully light—for a man so heavy; but it did not escape the quick ear of the watchful Briton. He turned instantly, presented his piece, and challenged. But the coast was clear; there was nothing to be seen; the scout had already crossed the road, and was sheltered in the thick copse on the other bank of the avenue. The leaves and brush were shaken, and the only response made to the challenge of the sentry was the hooting of a melancholy owl, and a noise like the shaking of wings among the branches. “What's the matter?” cried the companion sentinel, approaching the challenger, who had remained stationary in the brief interval occupied by this event. “What have you seen?” “Nothing—it's only an owl. These woods are full of them; the d—d things keep one starting on all sides as if the `swamp fox' himself was scrambling over the ditch.” 16* The scout lay close, and heard the question and response. He chuckled to himself with no little self-complaisance as he listened. “By Gimini!” he half muttered, aloud, “what a poor skunk of a fellow I'd be, now, if my edication was no better than that sentry's. Not to know a man's hollow from a blind bird's!” Waiting a few moments until the guardians of the night had resumed their walk, he at length boldly left the copse, and proceeded without hesitation, though cautiously, still nearer to the house which held the prisoner. Meanwhile, full of anxiety, the lovers lingered together. This was the night on which Scipio was despatched in search of Witherspoon, and all their thoughts were necessarily given to his successful management of the enterprise. Well might they be anxious; and how natural was the deep and breathless silence which, for protracted hours, overspread the apartment as if with a dense and heavier mantle than that of night. The arm of Mellichampe infolded the waist of the maiden. She lay sadly, as was her wont, upon its supporting strength; and her cheek, with all the confidence of true and unsophisticated affection, rested upon his bosom. She feared nothing—she doubted nothing—at that moment; for she knew how noble was the heart that beat beneath it. Her fears were elsewhere. The fate of her lover hung suspended, as it were, upon a thread. He was about to seek a perilous chance for life, to escape from a more perilous, and, as it appeared to them, an unavoidable necessity. Upon the cunning of the slave—upon his successful search after the partisans,—and upon their readiness and ability for the adventure, the life of Mellichampe depended! How many contingencies to be met and overcome! How many difficulties to be avoided or surmounted—how many dangers to be hazarded and sought! The accumulating thoughts of these took from her all hope. She was no longer sanguine, though her more buoyant lover, in all the eloquent warmth of a young heart, strove to persuade her into confidence. She lay upon his bosom, and wept bitter tears. Suddenly there came again to the apartment the faint, distant, but distinct sound—the whistle of the woodman. Mellichampe lifted her head from its place of rest, and his heart increased its beatings. His eye brightened: and, as she beheld its glance, her own kindled amid its tears. Again, and again, did the well-known notes glide into the apartment, and well did the youth know then that his friends were at hand. “Hear—hear it, my Janet. He is there,—it is Witherspoon,—it is his signal,—the same that has come to me, and cheered me, night after night, when you could no longer be with me. Do you not hear it?” The sense of the maiden did not seem so quick as that of her lover. She paused, and, though her eye had caught a glow from the kindled expression of his, it still seemed that she doubted the reality of the sounds, when an appeal was made to her own distinct consciousness. She was a sweet dependant—one who could receive consolation from the assurances of another: but, save in love, who could give little in return. “Is it a whistle, Ernest?—it seems to me little more than a murmur of the wind. Ah, I do—I do hear it now,—it is—it is a whistle.” And her head sank, in her joy, again upon the manly and aroused bosom of her lover. “It is he, and all's well if Scipio does not miss him. Janet, dear love, we must see to this. Scipio may not yet be gone; and, if not, methinks I can direct him to the very spot whence these sounds come. I know I can. See, dear,—hark!—to the north,—directly to the north—is it not? You hear it now,—there,—in that direction, and that is towards the little bay that lies between this house and the avenue. That's just the spot in which a good scout would lurk at such a moment, and from that spot he knows that I can hear his signal. He must be there now; and, if Scipio passes in that direction, he must find him. If not gone, the fellow must go at once, for Witherspoon can't remain long in one spot while in this neighbourhood. The scouts may trouble him. See to it, then, dear Janet,—see if Scipio be not gone, and send him on that course: and hold me not burdensome, dearest, that I give you, in these dangerous hours, more employment that affection.” “Speak not thus, Ernest,” replied the maiden, fondly, as she proceeded to execute the mission; “speak not thus—not thus to me. Are not love's labours his pleasures always?—does he not rejoice to serve? I do, I am sure. I feel that my best pleasures are my labours always—always when they are taken for you.” “Heaven bless you, my Janet,” he murmured, fondly, in reply, as his lips were pressed upon her forehead; “Heaven bless you, and make me worthy of all this devotion.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. But Scipio was already gone upon his mission, and the maiden looked for him in vain. The next fear of Mellichampe was that he should miss the person he sought. Scipio, however, though he had left the house, had not yet passed the enclosure. The line of sentinels had yet to be gone through; and a task, like that we have just seen overcome by Witherspoon, had yet to be performed by the negro, in crossing the avenue. He had his arts also, and his plan was one after his own heart and fashion. Creeping along by the fence, which ran circuitously from the house of the overseer to the avenue, and which we have seen employed as a screen to Singleton's riflemen, he reached the entrance of the avenue, though without being able to cross it at the point he made. The sentinels in this quarter were too numerous and close to permit him to attempt it there, and, keeping along the skirts of the copse, and under its shade, he moved upwards. The soldiers of Barsfield were more watchful without than within; and, though but a few yards separated the negro, in his stealthy progress, from the pacing sentinel, such was the address of Scipio, that he occasioned not the slightest apprehension. But to cross the avenue, and reach the dense wood that lay on the opposite side, was the work of most difficult achievement. To accomplish this, it was the aim of Scipio to pass through a drain which crossed the avenue, and conducted the waters from the two ditches, when overflowed, into a third, by means of which they were carried off into a hollow bay lying some fifty yards distant in the woods. To penetrate the umbrageous copse on one side of the avenue,—to watch the moment when the sentinel's back should be turned,—then, dropping down silently into the ditch, to crawl into the drain, the mouth of which was immediately alongside of it, was the scheme of Scipio. In pursuance of this scheme, he passed on with all the stealthy adroitness of the wildcat—now hurrying, as he found himself too much without the cover of the trees,—now crawling forwards, on hands and knees, as the clambering vines around him set a firm barrier against undue uprightness,—and now lying or standing, motionless, as any warning or occasional sounds reached his ears, either from the camp which he had left, or the woods to which he was speeding. The exceeding brightness of the moonlight rendered increased precautions necessary, and gave bitter occasion of complaint to the negro, to whom, like all of his colour, the darkness of the night was a familiar thing, and opposed no sort of obstruction to his nocturnal wanderings when the plantations otherwise were all fast asleep. He penetrated the copse, and, thrusting his sable visage through the shrubbery, looked from side to side upon the two sentinels who paced that portion of the avenue in sight. He duly noted their distances and position, and, receding a pace, threw himself flat upon the bank and crawled downward into the ditch. The mouth of the drain lay a little above him, conveniently open and large; and there could have been no sort of difficulty, when he once reached that point, of making his way through it into the opposite cover. But it so happened that Scipio, in his progress, gave more of his regards to the sentinel, and less to the path immediately before him, than was either prudent or proper. He did not perceive a slender and decayed pine-limb which lay partially over the route he was pursuing. His hand rested heavily upon it in his progress, and it gave way beneath the pressure, with a crack which might have reached the ears of a sentinel at a much greater distance. With the sound, he turned suddenly in the direction of the negro. The poor fellow had his work to begin anew. He had plunged, with the yielding branch, incontinently into the mire, and in the first moment of the accident his entire face had been immersed in its slime. However, there was no time for regrets, and but little for reflection. The proceeding of Scipio was that of an instinct rather than a thought. He heard the fierce challenge of the sentinel, who yet did not see him. He saw that, in any endeavour at flight, he must be shot; and to seek to prosecute his scheme would be idle, as the drain lay between him and the advancing soldier: he could not reach it in time to escape his eyes. In boldness alone could he hope to escape; and, in the moment of sudden peril, audacity is frequently the truest wisdom. He rose upon his feet with the utmost composure; and, without seeking to retreat or advance, exclaimed as he rose, in all the gusto of a well-fed negro's phraseology, with a degree of impudence which might have imposed upon a more sagacious head than that of the sentinel before him— “Look 'ere, misser sodger,—take care how you shoot at mossa nigger. Good sarbant berry scarce in dis country; and, when gempleman hab sarbant like Scip, he ain't foolish 'nough for sell 'em. No gold— no silber money guine buy Scip; so take care, I tell you, how you spile you' pocket.” “Why, what the hell, Scip, are you doing there?” demanded the gruff soldier, who knew him well. “Ki, Mass Booram, wha' for you ax sich foolish question? Enty you see I tumble in de ditch? Suppose you tink I guine dare of my own head, and spile my best breeches? You's wrong. I hold on de branch, and de branch breck, and so I tumble. Wha' more? Da's all.” “And suppose, Scip, that instead of coming up to you civilly, as I have done, I should have sent a bullet into you ribs, or poked you a little with this bagnet?” “You bin do sich ting, Mass Booram, I say you no gempleman. Nebber gempleman hit nigger if he kin help it; 'cause a nigger's a 'spectable character wha' can't help heself. Da's a good reason for udder people for no hurt 'em. 'Tis only poor buckrah dat does trouble nigger. Scip has ambition for gempleman; but a poor buckrah, Mass Booram, he no wuss he tree copper.” “All very well, Scipio; but what brought you here, old fellow? Don't you know you have no business in this quarter?” “Who tell you dat, Mass Booram? He's a d—n fool of a nigger heself if he tell you so. Wha's de reason I say so?—'cause, you see, I hab business in dis quarter. Let me ax you few question, Mass Booram, and talk like a gempleman, 'cause I can't 'spect white man when he lib 'pon gar-broff.” “Go on, Scip,” replied the soldier, complacently. “Fuss, den—you know I hab mossa, enty?” “Yes, to be sure; if you hadn't, Scip, I'd take you for myself: I like a good negro mightily.” “'Speck you does, but da's noting; you hab for ax if good nigger like you. Mossa want to sell Scip, he gib um ticket look he owner: da's de business. But da's not what we hab for talk 'bout. If I b'long to mossa, wha' he name?” “Why, Mr. Berkeley, to be sure!” “Da's a gospel. I b'long to Dick Berkeley,—dis plantation b'long to Dick Berkeley,—Dick Berkeley hab he cow, enty, Mass Booram?” “Yes, cow and calf in plenty, and enough of every thing besides. I only wish I had half as much, I would not carry this d—d heavy musket.” “Ha! you leff off sodger? You right, Mass Booram; sodger is bad business,—nebber sodger is good gempleman. He hab for cuss—he hab for drunk: he hab for hurt udder people wha's jist as good and much better dan heself. I terra you what, Mass Booram, Scip wouldn't be sodger for de world and all da's in it; he radder be poor buckrah—any ting sooner dan sodger. A sodger is a poor debbil, dat hab no ambition for 'spectability: I radder be nigger-driber any day, dan cappin, like Mass Barsfield.” “You would, would you? you d—d conceited crow in a corn-field! Why, Scipio, you're the most vainest flycatcher in the country,” said the other, good-naturedly. Scipio received the speech as a compliment. “Tank you, Mass Booram. You's a gempleman, and can comperhend. But wha' I was telling you?— ah! Mossa hab cow. Wha' den? Now I guine show you wha' bring me here. Da's some of you sodger bin guine tief he milk, and breck down de gate of de cow-yard. Wha' den?—Brindle gone—Becky gone —Polly gone. Tree of mossa best cow gone, cause you sodger lub milk. Wha' Scip for do? Wha' mossa tell um. It's dat is bring me here. I guine look for de cow. I no bring um home by daylight, mossa say driber shall gib me hell.” “And so you want to pass here, Scipio, in order to look after the cattle? Suppose now I should not suffer you to pass—suppose I should send you back to get your flogging?” “Suppose you does?” said the other, boldly; “Suppose you does, you's no gempleman. Da's a mean buckrah, Mass Booram, wha' kin do so to poor nigga. Wha' for you guine let mossa gib me hell? I ebber hurt you, Mass Booram? 'Tis you own sodger guine for tief de milk, dat's let out Brindle and Becky. Scip nebber let 'em out. Wha' for you no say—whip de sodger—wha' for you say whip de nigga?” “It is a hard case, Scip, and you shall pass, though it's agin orders. But remember, old boy, when you bring home the cows, I must have the first milking. You shall provide me with milk so long as we stay here for saving you from this flogging.” “Da's a bargin,” said the negro, preparing to depart: “da's fair. Mass Booram, I bin always tink you was a gempleman, dat hab a lub for poor nigga. I kin speak for you after dis.” “Thank you, Scipio,” said the other, good-naturedly. “Take piece of gunja—he berry good, Mass Booram—my wife make 'em.” The negro broke his molasses-cake evenly between himself and the soldier, who did not scruple readily to receive it. A few more words were exchanged between them, when, passing the avenue, Scipio hurried forward, and found himself, his chief difficulties surmounted, in the deep bosom of the adjoining woods. Free of all present restraint, the tongue of Scipio, Vol. II.—I 17 after a very common fashion among negroes, discoursed freely to its proprietor, aloud, upon the difficulties yet before him. “Well, 'spose I pass one, da's noting. Plenty more, I speck, scatter 'bout here in dese woods; and, if he ain't tory—wha' den? Some of dese Marion men jist as bad. He make noting of shoot poor nigga, if it's only to git he jacket. Cracky! wha' dat now? I hear someting. Cha! 'tis de wind only. He hab all kind of noise in dis wood for frighten people—sometime he go like a man groan wid a bullet-hole work in he back. Nodder time he go like a person was laughing; but I don't see noting here to make person laugh. Da's a noise now I don't comperhend—like de nocking ob old dry sticks together; 'spose it's some bird da's flapping off de moschetus wid his wings. It's a bad place in dis woods, and I wonder wha' make dat Dick Wedderspoon lub 'em so. Whay him now,—'tis like a blind nigga that don't come when you want um. I no bin look arter um now, I plump jist 'pon um. I no hab noting to ax um, he sure for answer. I no hab noting to gib um, he sure for put out he hand for someting. He's a—” At that moment a heavy slap upon the cheek from a ponderous hand saluted the soliloquizing Scipio, and arrested his complainings. The light flashed from the negro's eyes as he turned at this rough saluation. “Cracky! Who da dat—Mass Wedderspoon?” “Ah, you rascal—you know'd well enough. You only talked out your impudent stuff for me to hear, Scipio, 'cause you know'd I was close at hand.” “I sway to G—d, Mass Wedderspoon, I nebber b'lieb you been so close. I bin look for you.” “Why, you numscull, you came a great deal out of your way, for I was behind you all the time. You managed that sentinel mighty well, Scip,—I heard the whole of your palaver, and really did believe at first that the cows were off, and you were going after them.” “And how come you no b'lieb now, Mass Wedderspoon?” “Because, you were no sooner out of his sight fairly, but you began to go faster than before—much faster than you ever did go when you went out into the swamp after cattle.” “Da's a trute. But you know, Mass Wedderspoon, wha' I come out for—you know who I looking arter?” “No—I do not; but I want to know a good deal that you can tell me, so the sooner you begin the better. How is Airnest, for the first?” “He mos' well: but here's de paper—read 'em—he tell you ebbry ting.” The scout seized the scrawl, and strove to trace out its contents by moonlight, but, failing to do so, he drew a pistol from his belt, and, extracting the load, flashed the priming in a handful of dry straw which Scipio heaped together. With some little difficulty he deciphered the scrawl, while the negro kept plying the fuel to the blaze. Its contents were soon read and quickly understood. Witherspoon was overjoyed. The prospect of Mellichampe's release, even though at the risk of a desperate fight, was productive to him of the most complete satisfaction. “Go back,” he said, after a while, to the negro; “go back and tell Airnest that you've seen me, and that all's well. Tell him I'll go my death for him, and do my best to git others, though the time is monstrous short.” “You guine git 'em clear, Mass Wedderspoon, from de d—d hook-nose tory?” asked the negro. “I'll try, Scip, by the etarnal!” “Da's a gempleman. But dem little guns—da's jist what Mass Airnest want. He must hab someting, Mass Wedderspoon, for hole he own wid dem tory. I 2 Put de marble in de mout' of de pistol,—I'll carry um.” “'Spose they find 'em on you, Scip?” “Enty I fin' um. I pick um up in de path. You tink dem tory guine catch weasel asleep, when he 'tan' by Scip. No notion ob such ting, I tell you.” The scout gave him both pistols, which the negro immediately lashed about his middle, carefully concealing them from exposure by the thick waistband of his pantaloons. “Now go, Scip,—go back to Airnest, and tell him I've set my teeth to help him, and do what he axes. I'm guine back now to the boys in camp, and I reckon it won't be too much to say that Major Singleton will bring a smart chance of us to do the d—dest, by a leetle, that ever yet was done to help a friend out of a hobble.” They separated—one seeking the camp of Barsfield, the other that of Marion, which, at this time, a few miles only divided.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXV. The absence of Blonay occasioned no small annoyance to all the leading parties at “Piney Grove.” Suspicious of all things and persons, the tory captain, who depended for the prosecution of his scheme upon Blonay's ministry, began to fear that the Half-Breed was playing him false. Not confiding to him at first, under a doubt of his integrity, the suspicions of Janet and Mellichampe were duly increased by his absence. Neither of these parties seemed to think of the possibility of evil having befallen him. It was more natural, he was so low and destitute, to think of his evil nature rather than of his human liability to mishap. But Barsfield made his preparations, notwithstanding the absence of his ally. He had already chosen a certain number of his more resolute and ready men, to whom certain stations were to be assigned, along where the course of Mellichampe lay, under the guidance of the Half-Breed. The tory, however, had not communicated any thing calculated to arouse the suspicions of those whom he employed. That communication was left over for the last moment. He simply prescribed their places of watch, and commanded the utmost vigilance. There was another order given about this time by Captain Barsfield, which had its annoyances for other parties in our narrative. To Lieutenant Clayton was assigned the duty, with a small escort, of conveying Mellichampe for trial to Charleston, in the beginning of the ensuing week. This order produced some little sensation. “And you really leave `Piney Grove' so soon, Lieutenant Clayton?” was the inquiry of Rose Duncan that evening, shortly after tea was over, of the hitherto gay gallant who sat beside her. The old gentleman, Mr. Berkeley—as had been usual with him for some time past—had retired early. His daughter, as a matter now of course, was with her lover; and the two, Rose and Clayton, as was much the case since the capture of Mellichampe, were tête-à-tête. There was nothing in the words themselves indicative of more than a common feeling of curiosity—nothing, perhaps, in the manner of their expression; and yet the lieutenant could not help the fancy that persuaded him to think that there was a hesitating thickness of voice in the utterance of the speaker, that spoke of a present emotion. His eyes were at once turned searchingly upon her face, as he listened to the flattering inquiry, and her own sank to the ground beneath his gaze. He replied after the pause of a single instant. 17* “If I could persuade myself, Miss Duncan, that you shared in any degree the regret which I feel at leaving `Piney Grove,' though it would greatly increase my reluctance to do so, it would afford me no small consolation during my absence.” The lieutenant began to look serious and sentimental, and the maiden recovered her caprice. Her answer was full of girlish simplicity, while her manner was most annoying, arch, and satirical. “Well, I do, Mr. Clayton—I do regret your going— that I do, from the bottom of my heart. Bless me, what should I have done all this time but for you?—how monstrous dull must have been these hours. I really shall miss you very much.” The lieutenant was disappointed. He had not looked for a transition so sudden, in the voice, words, and manner of his fair but capricious companion; and, for a moment, he was something daunted. But, recovering himself with an effort, as from frequent intercourse he had discovered that the only way to contend with one of her character was to assume some of its features, he proceeded to reply in a manner which had the effect of compelling her somewhat to resume that momentary gravity of demeanour which had accompanied her first speech; and which, as it was unfrequent, he had found, in her, rather interesting. “But I have a consolation in my exile, Miss Duncan, since it is to a city full of the fair; and dances and flirtations every night in Charleston, with the young, the rich, and the beautiful, should compensate one amply for the loss—ay, even for the loss—temporary though I hope it may be—of the fair Miss Duncan herself.” “Treason—treason—a most flagrant rebellion, and worthy of condign punishment,” was the prompt reply of the maiden; though it evidently called for no inconsiderable effort on her part to respond so readily, and to dissipate the cloudy expression just then coming over her face again. She was about to continue her reply, and, moved by some uncertain feeling, Lieutenant Clayton had transferred himself from a neighbouring chair to a seat on the sofa beside her, when Janet Berkeley entered the room. Her appearance produced a visible constraint upon both the parties, and she saw at a glance that she was unnecessary to their conference. She did not seem to remark them, however; and, though she perceived that a new interest was awakened in their mutual minds for each other, she had no time to give to reflection on this subject: nor, indeed, have we. She left the room after getting what she sought, and returned to the apartment of Mellichampe. She had scarcely done so, when Barsfield joined the two, and offered another obstacle to a conversation which, to both parties, had promised to become so interesting. So much for the condition of things in the camp of the tory. In that of the partisan, affairs were even more promising. Witherspoon reached it in no long time after his interview had taken place with Scipio. He immediately sought out his superior. Major Singleton was the individual to whom he made his communication; and, through him, the paper sent by Mellichampe, and the facts furnished by the scout, were duly put in Marion's possession. The words of the chief were few—his plans soon laid—his decision readily adopted. “It will do, Singleton,” he said, with a lively air of satisfaction. “The game is a good one, and only requires to be played with spirit. The plan promises better than that of Horry, since we shall now not only rescue Mellichampe, I think, but strike a fatal blow at Barsfield's position. What number of loyalists does Thumbscrew report as in `Piney Grove' since the 27th?” “Eighty-six have gone in to him since the 27th— thirty-two before—and the troop which he brought, after all its losses, could scarcely be less than twenty-five.” “Making in all—” “One hundred and forty-three, rank and file.” “Not too many—not too many, major, if we employ the scheme. What say you?” “I think not, general. Barsfield will concentrate his men, most probably, on the line over which Mellichampe is to be conducted. That direction we know from this paper. The advantage is important which it gives us, since we have only to plan our enterprise so as to avoid this—fall upon other points of his camp, and break in upon his ambush, flank and rear, while avoiding his front.” “True, Singleton,—it will be to our advantage in beating Barsfield, I grant you,—but not in serving Mellichampe. If he keeps this line, it will be necessary that we strike a moment before he approaches, and just when he has left the house, or he must fall before our help would avail him, coming in from flank and rear. We must confound the ambush in part—we must keep the whole camp of the tory alive by a concerted attack at all points, in front not less than in rear, or we lose Mellichampe, though we gain the fight.” Singleton acknowledged the difficulty. “If,” resumed Marion, “if Mellichampe would only think to avoid the track prescribed by his confederate, and force him to go aside upon another route—however slight the variation—it would yet serve us, and we might save him.” “I doubt not, general, that he will think of this—he is wonderfully shrewd in such matters, though rash and thoughtless enough in others. I think we may rely upon him that he will.” “We must hope for it, at least,” said Marion. “The affair looks promising enough in all other respects, and we must drive our whole force to the adventure. We have been cooped up long enough. Go, Singleton, order in vour remote scouts. Get all your men in readiness, and send your lieutenant, Humphries, to me. I have some instructions for him. I will lead in this business myself.” Singleton proceeded to the spot where Humphries usually slept, but he was not to be found. Let us account for his absence. Humphries, secure of his enemy, excited by the trying scene through which he had passed, and scarcely less so by the novel form of death to which circumstances had prompted him to devote his victim, returned to the camp in a state of the utmost mental agitation. It was yet daylight, and sundry little duties in the camp called for his attention. These he performed almost unconsciously. His thoughts were elsewhere. An excitation of feeling, which sometimes moved him like insanity, disturbed his judgment, and affected the coherence and the regularity of his movements. In this state of mind, with just enough of consciousness to feel that he was wandering, and that he needed repose, he made his way about dusk from the observation of the camp, and seeking out a little bank in the swamp, with which he was familiar, where he might sleep in secrecy, he threw himself under a tree, and strove to forget the past. Shutting his eyes, he hoped in this way to shut out all the images of strife and terror which yet continued to annoy him. He succeeded in his desire, and at length slept. But his sleep was more full of terrors than his waking thoughts. He dreamed, and the horror of his dreams aroused him. He heard the cries of the victim whom he had buried while yet alive. His dreadful shrieks rang in his ears; and, bursting from their sockets in blood, he saw the goggle eyes looking down upon him, through the crevice in the cypress where he had last seen them. This was not long to be endured. He started from his sleep—from his place of repose, and stood upon his feet. Had he slept?—this was doubtful to him—so vivid, so imposing and real had been the forms and fancies I 2 of his vision. But the night had fairly set in, and this convinced him that he had slept. A faint light from the stars came scattered and tremblingly through the leaves, that complained in the cool wind of evening that fitfully stole among them. The moon was just rising, and gave but feeble light. The heavy trees seemed to dance before his eyes—huge shadows stalked gloomily between them, and, shuddering with bitter thoughts and terrifying fancies, the stout woodman for a few moments was unmanned. “I can bear it no longer,” he cried aloud, in his disquiet. “I can bear it no longer.” With the words he picked up his rifle, which lay upon the spot where he had lain himself. He felt for the knife in his belt, and, finding that his equipment was complete, he moved away with the haste of one who has fully resolved—saddled his horse, which he mounted with all speed—and, barely replying to the several challenges of the sentinels, he darted forth upon the well-known road. The relentless spur left the steed no breathing moment. The thoughts of the trooper flew faster than he could drive his horse; and, though going at the utmost extent of his powers, the impatient trooper chafed that the animal went so slowly. The well-known swamp entrance was in sight—the cane-brake was passed—and there, rising up in dreadful silence, white and ghostlike in its aspect under the increasing brightness of the moonlight, stood the tall cypress in which his victim was buried. The steed of the trooper was stopped suddenly—so suddenly that he almost fell back upon his haunches. His rider alighted— but, for some moments, frozen to the spot, he dared not approach the object before him. The awful stillness of the scene appalled him. He strove to listen—he would have given worlds to have heard a groan—a moan—a sigh—however slight, from the cavernous body of that tree! A curse—ay, though the wretch within had again cursed his mother—would have been grateful to the senses and the heart of him who now stood gazing upon it in horror and in silence, but with the motionlessness of a statue. He recovered strength at last sufficient to advance. He reached the tree. The wedges which secured his prisoner had been undisturbed. He put his ear to the rough bark of its sides, but he heard no sounds from within. He drew with desperate hand the pegs from the upper crevice, and fancied that a slight breathing followed it; or it might be the soughing of the wind, suddenly penetrating the aperture. He called aloud to the inmate —he shouted with his mouth pressed to the opening—he implored—he cursed his victim—but he got no answer. What were his emotions as he pulled, with a giant's muscle, the hard wedges from the hollow of the tree below? He had slain his foe in battle—he had killed, without remorse, the man who, personally, had never done him wrong:—why should he suffer thus from the just punishment of a vindictive and a sleepless enemy? He felt, but did not stop to analyze, this subtlety. He tore away the chunks which had fastened the opening, and thrust his hands into the hollow. The legs of the Half-Breed had sunk down from the knobs upon which they had rested, while he was capable of exertion, and they were now a foot deep in the water which filled the hollow. With both hands, and the exercise of all his strength, Humphries succeeded in pulling him out by them. The body was limber, and made no effort and opposed no resistance. Dragging him through the water, which he could not avoid, the partisan bore him to the bank, upon which he laid him. As yet he showed no signs of life; and the labour which his enemy had taken seemed to have been taken in vain; but the fresh air, and the immersion which he had unavoidably undergone in passing through the water, seemed to revive him —so Humphries thought, as, bending over him, he watched his ghastly features in the moonlight. He tore open the jacket and shirt from his bosom, and felt a slight pulsation at his heart. Never was joy more perfect than, at this moment, in the bosom of the partisan. He laughed with the first conviction that his enemy still lived. He laughed first, loudly and wildly, and then the tears, an unrestrainable current, flowed freely from his eyes. The Half-Breed continued to revive; and Humphries prayed by his side, as fervently as if praying, in the last moment of his existence, for the mercy of an offended God. He strove in every known way to assist the workings of nature in the resuscitation of his enemy. He fanned him with his cap—he sprinkled him freely with water, and spared no means, supposed in his mind to be beneficial, to bring about the perfect restoration of his victim. At length he succeeded. The legs of the Half-Breed were, one after the other, suddenly drawn up, then relaxed —he sighed deeply—and, finally, the light stole into his glazed orbs, as if it had been some blessed charity from the moon, that now glistened over them. As he continued to improve, and with the first show of consciousness, Humphries lifted him higher up the bank, and laid him at the foot of a shrub tree which grew at hand. He then receded from him to a little distance—placed himself directly before his eyes—resumed his rifle, which he prepared and presented, and thus, squat upon one knee in front of him, he awaited the moment of perfect recovery, which should again, in the consciousness of new life, inform him, at the same time, of the presence of an ancient enemy. Thus stationed, he watched the slowly recovering Blonay, for the space of half an hour, in silence and in doubt. The scene was a strange one; and to his mind, not yet relieved from the previously active terrors of his imagination, an awful and imposing one. In the deep habitual gloom of that swamp region, among its flickering shadows—girdled by its thick and oppressive silence, and watching its skeleton trees until they seemed imbued with life, and, in the ghostly and increasing moonlight, appeared to advance upon, and then to recede away from him—he felt, at every moment of his watch, an increasing and superstitious dread of all things and thoughts— all sounds and objects, that assailed his senses, however remotely, and roused his emotions, however slight. And as the slow consciousness grew, like a shadow itself, in the cheek and eye of the man whom he had so lately beheld as lifeless, he half doubted whether it was human, and not spectral life, that he now beheld. He half believed that an evil spirit had possessed the mangled and deformed frame of the man before him, and was now beginning, with an aspect of anxious malignity, once more to glare forth upon him from the starting eyes of the Half-Breed. He shuddered with the thought, and he felt that his grasp upon his rifle grew more and more unsteady, until at length he almost doubted his own capacity to secure a certain aim upon his enemy, in the event of strife. With this fear, determined, as he was, to have a perfect control over the life of Blonay, whatever might be the movement of the latter, he rose from the spot where he watched, and approached so nigh to the slowly recovering man, that the extended rifle nearly touched his breast. At that moment Blonay started, raised his head, and, half sitting up, gazed wildly upon the scene around him. His eye caught that of Humphries in the next instant, and he acknowledged the presence of his enemy by an involuntary start, rising, at the same moment, to a full sitting posture, and answering the watchful glance of the partisan by one of inquiry and astonishment, not less intense in its character than that which he encountered. His eye next rested upon his own rifle, which Humphries had thrown upon the bank, in the full glare of the moonlight, and his body involuntarily inclined towards 18 it. With the movement came the corresponding one of the partisan. The muzzle of his weapon almost reached Blonay's breast, and the lock clicked with singular emphasis, in the general silence of the scene, as Humphries cocked it. “Stir not, Goggle—move a foot, and I'll put the lead through you. It's a mercy I don't do it now.” Without a word, Blonay kept his position, and his eye met that of his foe without fear, though with the utmost passiveness of expression. Humphries continued— “You've hunted me like a varmint—you've pulled trigger upon me—I have your mark, and will carry it, I reckon, to my grave. There's no reason why I should let you run.” He paused, as if awaiting an answer; but the stare of his enemy alone responded to his speech. “What do you say now, Blonay, why I shouldn't put the bullet into you? Speak now—it's only civility.” “Adrat it, nothing,” said the other, drawing up his legs. “You're from my own parish, and that's one reason,” said Humphries, “that's one reason why I want to give you fair play, and it's reason enough why I don't want to spill your blood. Answer me now, Goggle, like a man—do you want mine?” He paused, but received no answer. He thus proceeded— “I had you safe enough, but I couldn't find it in my heart to take your life after that fashion, so I let you out. Tell me, now, if you can go without taking tracks after me again? Suppose I let you run—suppose I leave you, without troubling you now with this lead, that only waits till I lift this finger to go through your scull—will you follow me again?—will you come hunting for my blood? Speak! for your life depends on it.” “Adrat it, Bill Humphries, you've got the gun, and you say there's a bullet in it. I'm here afore you, and I don't dodge. I ain't afeard,” was the reckless and seemingly impatient response. “That's as much as to say that you won't promise, and it's enough to satisfy me to my own conscience for pulling trigger upon you at once. But I won't. I'll give you a chance for your life. There shall be fair play between us. Take your rifle—there it lies—get yourself ready, and take your stand on the edge of the bank, and then be as quick as you think proper, for the first one to cut away will have the best chance for life.” A visible change came over the features of the Half-Breed as he listened to this address. His head dropped —his chin rested upon his breast—and, without any other answer, he simply raised the hand which Humphries had mashed so remorselessly with the pine-knot, when its owner had thrust it through the crevice of the tree. He raised it, and in the action showed to his enemy how utterly impracticable it was for him to hold the rifle with any hope of its successful use. Humphries was silenced, and his own feelings were strongly affected when he actually beheld a tear in the blear eye of the Half-Breed, as he looked upon the maimed and utterly helpless member. The privation must have been terrible indeed, to extort such an acknowledgment from one so inflexible. It certainly was the greatest evil that could have befallen him, to lose the use of the weapon on which so much depended; and then, what was his mortification to submit to a challenge from a hated enemy—his weapon and his foe alike at hand—unable to employ the one or to punish the other? The rifle of Humphries was lowered as he felt the full force of Blonay's answer. He turned away to conceal his own emotion. “Go!” he cried, “go, Blonay—you are free this time. I must take my chance, and run my risk of your taking tracks after me again. Go now,—but better not let me meet you. My blood is hotter at other times than now. I'm sad and sorry now—and there's something to-night in the woods that softens me, and I can't be angry—I can't spill your blood. But 'twon't always be so—and, if you're wise, you'll take the back tracks and go down quietly to Dorchester.” Without waiting for any answer, the partisan hurried through the cane-brake; and, with a motion less rapid than that which brought him, took his way back to the camp of Marion, where he arrived not a moment too soon for the most active preparation and employment. Bruised, enfeebled, almost helpless, the Half-Breed slowly returned to the tory encampment at “Piney Grove.” He appeared before Barsfield at early morning on the day following that, the circumstances of which we have recorded. His presence quieted the anxieties, as it met the desires, of all parties. “Your hand—what is the matter with it?—why is it bound up?” demanded Barsfield. “Mashed it with a piece of timber in the swamp,” was the unscrupulous answer of the Half-Breed, who suppressed all the particulars of his affair with Humphries. “Any luck?—met with your man?” was the farther question. “No,” was the ready answer. “You are ready for mine, however?” “To-night—yes.” “At midnight. But you must see Miss Berkeley,— have every thing well understood, so that there will be no confusion—no delay. She does not suspect—she seems satisfied?” “Mighty well pleased.” “'Tis well. Thus, then, you will proceed. The sentinel will be withdrawn from the gallery, and you shall have, at the hour, another key to the padlock. Guide him forth as soon as possible after the withdrawal of the sentinel,—you know the course?” “Yes—by the railing, and so on to the avenue.” “Be particular, and do not leave the track for an instant. Go now—I shall be out of the way—seek Miss Berkeley, and conclude your arrangements with her for to-night.” The Half-Breed left him. “To-night!” were the only words uttered by the tory as he went towards the outposts, but they were full of import, and his face looked every thing which his lips forbore to utter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVI. That day was spent in arrangements. Barsfield chose his men for the purposes of assassination—but he did not surrender his secret to their keeping. He was too wary for that. They had their places assigned, and all that he condescended to unfold to them, by way of accounting for the special appointment and the earnest commands which he gave, may be comprised in few words. “I suspect,” said he, “that there is some treason among us. I suspect the scout—Blonay. I have reason to think he purposes, either this night or the next, to betray the camp to Marion, and to escape with the spy Mellichampe. You will therefore preserve the utmost watchfulness upon the posts which I assign you; and, if you see any thing to alarm you, any thing worthy of suspicion, act upon it decisively and without pause. If you see the prisoner with the scout, spare neither—put them both to death. To seek to recapture the spy might lose him, and such an event would be ruinous and disgraceful. I trust to you, men—you will do your duty.” 18* In the chamber of Mellichampe, whose fate thus hung upon a thread, the interest, it may be supposed, was not less important and exciting. Concealed in a shawl assumed for the purpose, the maiden carried to her lover the much desired weapons which Scipio had received from Witherspoon. The message of the trusty woodman was also delivered correctly, and the intelligence strengthened the youth accordingly, and half reconciled Janet to the experiment which she so much dreaded. “This is well—this is excellent!” cried Mellichampe, grasping the pistols, trying the charge, and examining their condition,—“this is well,—both loaded— good flints,—I fear nothing now, Janet. At least, I am able to fight,—I am not less able to destroy than my enemies.” She turned away with a shudder; but she felt happier and more hopeful as she beheld his exultation. Not less busy in the camp of Marion, the entire force of the partisans was preparing for the assault. Every available arm was required for the service, as the little squad of the “swamp fox” at this period barely numbered one hundred and fifty men—many of these only partially armed, and some of them who had never been in fight before. “Have you had reports from the scouts, Major Singleton?” demanded the general. “Not yet, sir. I have sent out Humphries and Witherspoon, who will bring us special accounts by noon. We shall have time enough then for our movement.” “Quite—quite. This plan of Thumbscrew's is admirable. If the scouts do handsomely, we can put a dead shot for every sentinel on one side of the avenue. It can scarcely fail, I think.” “Impossible, sir—if the action is concerted, and I think we have time enough to make it so. The firing of the tents must follow the first knowledge we have of Mellichampe's movement; and that knowledge, if I mistake him not, we shall have as soon as he leaves the house, for Witherspoon has sent him his pistols. When the alarm is given by the blaze, I will charge from the lower bay—to which I can get, with all my men, by nine o'clock—moving slowly and without detection. With proper firmness we cannot help but succeed.” “I doubt not we shall do so, major—I doubt not that we shall defeat the tory, and I hope annihilate his force; but, in that first moment, I dread every thing for Mellichampe. The tory, doubtless, will watch every step which he takes, and he may be murdered the moment after he leaves the house.” “But it is on one route only that he puts his guard. Relying on his scout as faithful, he will calculate upon his bringing Mellichampe into his very jaws—” “And how know we that he is not faithful to his employer? What reason is there to believe him friendly to Mellichampe? This is my doubt. So long as Barsfield can pay this fellow in solid gold, he has his fidelity.” “Yes, sir,—very probably; but I scarcely think that Mellichampe will keep the one track. I rely greatly on his sagacity in all matters of this sort, and think that the moment he leaves the dwelling, he will not feel himself bound to follow the lead of his companion.” “I hope not,” was the response of Marion to the sanguine calculations of Major Singleton; “I hope not, but I apprehend for him. We must do our best, however, and look to Good Fortune to help us through where we stumble. But no more. See now to your farther preparations, for we move by dusk.” The affair on hand impressed no one more seriously with its importance than Thumbscrew. He addressed Major Singleton the moment after his return, bringing the desired intelligence, which he did at noon. He addressed him to solicit what he styled a favour. “But why incur a danger so great, and, seemingly, so unnecessary? I see no use for it, Thumbscrew.” “No use!—there's use for it, major, and satisfaction; as for danger, I'm a born danger myself, and I shouldn't be afraid to stand in the way of my own shadow. But I don't think there's any danger, major,—to cross the avenue ain't so mighty hard to a man like me, that's played, in my time, a part of every beast, and bird, and crawling critter that's known to a Santee woodman. I can pass them sentries like a gust from a big winged bird, and so they'll think me. I can git into that bay without waking a blind moscheto; and, once I gits there, I can do a mighty deal now, I tell you, by a sartin whistle which I has, to tell Airnest Mellichampe where to find me.” The arguments of Witherspoon soon persuaded his superior, and he went alone, long in advance of the partisans, on his individual and daring adventure. He gained the bay with the same ease and good fortune which marked his progress in a similar effort, which we have previously described. There he waited anxiously, but in patience, the events which were at hand. At nightfall the partisans, the entire force of Marion, approached “Piney Grove”—not so near as to be subjected to any danger of discovery, yet sufficiently so to be in readiness for any circumstance which might suddenly call them forward. In a deep wood, the very one in which Scipio's interview had taken place with Witherspoon, they alighted, and Marion proceeded to divide his men into three bodies. To one, under command of Colonel Horry, he assigned the task of firing the tents and striking at the main post of the encampment. To another troop, acting simply as cavalry, under Major Singleton, he gave it in charge to attack the rear by a sudden and fierce onset, the moment that Horry should commence the affair—the firing of the tents being a common signal. To himself he reserved the more difficult, if not more dangerous task, of distributing his men as riflemen, in front, along the whole line of the avenue, prepared to commence the attack in that quarter; and, pressing through the avenue—having first slain the sentinels, each man of whom was to be marked out by a corresponding rifleman—to unite with the other two bodies near the bay so frequently spoken of, where it was their hope to be in time to save Mellichampe from the knife or pistol of the prepared assassins. This arrangement made, Singleton's troop remounted their horses, and, under the direction of their leader, made a wide circuit around the camp, so as to throw themselves into the thicket lying in its rear. This they gained before the moon rose. The men commanded by Marion and Horry fastened their horses securely out of the reach of danger, and pressed forward on foot to their several stations. The riflemen stole individually from cover to cover, until they ranged themselves along the whole line of the avenue, and looked down upon the pacing sentinels, who walked their rounds all unconscious of the lurking death which lay hovering in dreadful silence, and unseen, around them. Each partisan in this way had selected his victim; and the “swamp fox” himself, lying along a little ditch overgrown with weeds and half full of water, lay as secretly and still as ever did the adroit animal whose name had been assigned him. The hour was approaching. Barsfield had set his snare, and was impatient. “Go now—and bring him forth,” he said to Blonay. “The time is close at hand.” The Half-Breed, obedient to his will, left him on the instant. “He is mine at last!” was the triumphant thought which the tory muttered at that moment to himself. “The toil will soon be over, and I shall triumph now— I will bathe my feet in his blood.” He went the rounds of the men whom he had stationed on the watch for his victim. Some were immediately around the house, though not known to Blonay. Barsfield anticipated the possibility of the fugitive's taking another direction than that which he had prescribed. For this possibility he had prepared. He was resolved that his plan should not fail through want of due precautions. He saw that all were in readiness; and, not remote, he took a station for himself which would enable him, as soon as the deed was done, to gratify himself with the sight of his murdered victim. “Hist! hem!” were the sounds that saluted Mellichampe at the door of his chamber. The hour had come. In the next instant the door was unlocked, and, with a fearless heart, having his pistols ready in his grasp, he met his guide at the entrance. “Are you Mr. Blonay?” was his question, as the darkness of the passage-way did not permit him to distinguish features. The reply was affirmative. “I am ready,” said the youth. “Lead on.” “Go not—go not, dear Ernest!” cried Janet Berkeley, who was also watchful; “Go not, I pray you,—it is not too late,—return to your chamber, for I dread me of this trial. It will be fatal,—you cannot escape these assassins, and the night is so bright and clear—” “Hush!” he whispered,—“see you not?” and he pointed to Blonay. “I know—I know; but trust not—risk not, I implore you, Ernest. Mr. Blonay knows—he says that there is danger. He told me so but this moment.” “Nay, Janet,—but you are too apprehensive. I know the skill of Mr. Blonay,—he can help me through the danger, and I fear it not.” “But, dear Ernest—” He interrupted her, as, passing his arm about her waist, he bent down and whispered in her ears, “Would you prefer to see me hanging from a tree? Remember, Janet, this is my only hope.” “God help me! God be with you, and save you!” she exclaimed. He folded her to his bosom, and oh! the agony of doubt that assailed both hearts at that instant. It might be the last embrace that they should take in life. A mutual thought of this nature produced a mutual shudder at the same moment in their forms. “One—one more, my beloved!” he cried, as they parted—and, in another instant, he was gone from sight. She sank down where he left her. Her hands were clasped, and, too feeble for effort, yet too alive to her anxieties to faint into forgetfulness, she strove, but how vainly, even where she lay, to pray for his safety.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXVII. It was with conflicting emotions and an excited pulse that Mellichampe hurried away from the embrace of the maiden, possibly the very last that he should ever be permitted to enjoy. In another moment, and the woods were before his eyes; and he now felt assured that every step which he took from the dwelling must be taken in sight of his enemies. Yet he did not the less boldly descend from the threshold, though he believed that with every movement he came nigher to his murderer. He did not deceive himself with idle hopes of the forbearance and tender mercy of his foe, yet he was resolute to struggle to the last—he was prepared for any thing but martyrdom. Scarcely had he stepped from the door of the dwelling into the shadow of a little clump of trees that lay before it, when he heard the well-known whistle of Witherspoon. He could not mistake the sounds, and they came with a most cheering and refreshing influence upon his senses. “Trusty and brave Jack!” he muttered to himself, as he listened,—“at least I shall have one true and strong arm to help me in the struggle. I am not alone.” The repeated sounds guided him in his progress. He could not be mistaken now in their direction: he felt certain that they came from the little bay, which he well knew could easily conceal the scout so long as it continued unsuspected. He turned quickly in the direction of the sounds: Blonay touched his arm— “This way, sir,” said the Half-Breed, in a whisper. “No, sir, this way!” sternly, but in a similar whisper, responded Mellichampe. “This way, sir, as I bid you: you go with me in this direction, or you die.” “But, cappin—” said the other, hesitatingly. “No words—I trust you not—on!” The muttered and decisive language was amply seconded by the action of the speaker. One hand grasped the maimed wrist of the Half-Breed, the other held in the same moment the cocked pistol to his eyes. Wincing under the pain which the sudden seizure of his injured hand by that of Mellichampe had necessarily occasioned, the fierce savage, with the other, grasped his knife, and half drew it from the sheath. But the momentary anger seemed to pass away before he had fully bared it. He thrust it back again, and calmly replied to his irritable companion— “You can trust me, cappin; I'll go jist as you tells me, for I promised the gal—she's a good gal—I promised her to do the best, and I'll do jist as you says. Lead on where you wants to go.” “No, no—do you lead on, sir: I will not trust you. To the bay—but keep the trees, and do not show your person unnecessarily. On, sir—the moment you go aside, I shoot you down like a dog.” The words were of fierce character, and uttered with singular emphasis, but still in a whisper. The Half-Breed by no means relished the manner of Mellichampe, but he muttered to himself— “I promised her—she's a good gal—” And thus, reminding himself of his pledges, he prepared to go forward. “Keep close to those water-oaks,” said Mellichampe to his companion, and he himself sank into their shadow as he spoke. At that moment another whistle—not that of Marion's men—came from the path which they had left. It was answered by another, a few paces distant, on the opposite hand. Mellichampe thrust Blonay forward, and they both moved with increased rapidity along the range of water-oaks, which at intervals afforded them a tolerable shelter. Again the whistle was repeated, and, to the disquiet of the fugitives, it was instantly answered by some one immediately in front of them, and on the very path they were pursuing. “I reckon they've found us out—” Blonay began to speak, but Mellichampe interrupted him. “Silence, sir—no word—but follow me,” and the youth moved hurriedly along, still upon the path he had been pursuing, but looking out for his enemy, and cocking his pistol in readiness. A bush parted and waved a little before him, and with its evident motion Mellichampe darted aside. In the next moment came the shot, and immediately succeeding the report the youth heard a gasping exclamation from his companion, by which he knew him to be wounded— “Ah!—it's me—it's hit me—” Looking round, he saw the Half-Breed fall forward upon his face, but immediately rise upon his hands and knees, and crawl towards a little cluster of bushes which Vol. II.—K 19 rose close at hand; where, with all the instinct of an Indian, even after receiving his death-wound, he laboured to conceal himself. The case was evidently a desperate one. The youth was surrounded by his enemies; and, unless the diversion of the partisans was made promptly, he felt that he must be, in a few moments, in the power of his murderers. The shot had scarce been fired, and the exclamation of the wounded man uttered, when he heard a rush as of several pursuers from behind. He did not wait, but bounded forward, for he knew that his friends were in front, and to perish in the general combat would be infinitely better than any other hazard. But he was not allowed so readily to go forward. With his first movement from the tree which had covered him at the moment when Blonay fell, the assassin rushed out upon his path, with a recklessness which showed that he believed Mellichampe to be unarmed. He paid for his temerity with his life: at five paces, and before he could recover from his error, the youth shot him through the breast. The man staggered out of his path, and fell without farther effort, crying aloud— “The spy,—the spy!—he's gone!—to the bay!— Oh! I'm a dead man!” While he was yet falling, Mellichampe hurled the empty pistol into his face, and drawing the second and last from his bosom, cocked it instantly for immediate use, and hurried on towards the bay, which yet lay at some little distance beyond him. The rushing and the shouting of the tories, on every hand, informed him of the close watch which had been kept upon his movements. The voice of Barsfield was also heard above the clamour, in furious exhortation— “The spy has escaped with the Half-Breed: shoot them both down—let neither escape—but fail not to kill the spy;—no quarter to him!—five guineas to the man who kills him!” “He is here!” cried one, dragging the still living but mortally wounded Blonay from the bush where he had concealed himself. “Ha! where?” was the demand of Barsfield, rushing to the spot where he lay. Without looking he plunged his sword into the body, and felt the last convulsion as the victim writhed around the blade. But he spurned the carcass with his foot the next moment, when he discovered that the scout, and not Mellichampe, lay before him. With a fierce shout he led and hurried the pursuit, impetuously dashing forward with all the fury of one who, having been certain of his victim, now begins to apprehend disappointment. “Death to the spy!—pursue!—Five guineas to him who kills him! No quarter to the spy!” Such were his cries to his men as he himself pursued. They reached the ears of Mellichampe—they aroused him to a like fury. Desperate and enraged, his temper became unrestrainable, and, though imprudent in the last degree, he shouted back, even as he fled, his defiance to his foes. The whistle of Witherspoon fortunately reached his ear in that moment, and guided him on his flight. His voice, meanwhile, had disclosed the direction which he had taken to those who were now clamorously pursuing him. But the pursuit was arrested at the luckiest moment for the fugitive. The tents were now blazing, and wild cries came from the centre of the encampment. Clayton rushed across the path of Barsfield. “Stand aside—away! The spy—slay him! No quarter to the spy!” cried the fierce tory, as he thrust Clayton out of his path—his eyes glaring like balls of fire, and the foam gathering thick around his mouth and almost choking his utterance. “What is all this, Captain Barsfield?” cried the second officer, confusedly, to his superior. K 2 “Get from my path! Stand aside, or I hew thee down!” was the desperate answer. “But the camp's on fire!” said the lieutenant. “The camp's on fire!” was the general cry around him. Barsfield only answered by pressing forward—selfishly pursuing the one enemy, who, in his sight, took the place and preference of all others. Indeed, at that moment, he did not seem to be conscious of any other object or duty than that of arresting Mellichampe. “The spy—Mellichampe—he has seduced the sentinel—he is fled—there—Lieutenant Clayton,—there —in the bay! Pursue all, and kill him!—No quarter to the spy!” “But the camp—” said Clayton. “Let it burn! Let it burn!” His words were silenced—drowned in the sharp and repeated shot which rang along the whole line of the avenue. He became conscious on the instant, for the first time,—and now, at once, conceived the nature of that concerted combination which was likely to defraud him of his prey. Still he did not conceive the assault to be made by any large force. He did not think it possible. “A surprise,” he said; “a mere diversion to help the spy. To the front, Lieutenant Clayton,—send your loyalists to the avenue! Line the front,—it will soon be over,—it is but a straggling squad. Away—and leave me for the spy. I will manage him with these three men.” The coolness of Barsfield seemed to have come back to him as he gave these orders. But his rage was the greater from having been suppressed so long. He pressed forward to the bay with the three men who were with him. He believed that Clayton would soon manage the foe in front; and he was resolved upon the death of Mellichampe, even if he did not. In another moment, however, he was convinced that it was no random attack, simply for diversion, from a small squad. The clamour was that of a large force, and the repeated and well-known cry of the partisans followed the first volley of the sharp-shooters. “Marion's men—true blues—true blues! Hurra! no quarter—Tarleton's quarters! One and all, Marion's men!” “One and all, men!” were the stern, shrill notes that followed the cry. It was the sharp voice of Marion himself, and it was heard distinctly over the field: the sounds were fitly concluded by a second volley and an increasing uproar. “He is there with all his force!” exclaimed Barsfield; “but no matter. I cannot turn now, and, at least, Mellichampe is mine. He is here in this bay. They cannot help him in season, and he must perish. That done, I care not if Marion conquers—we can but become his prisoners.” These were the calculations of Barsfield, half uttered as he pursued. Mellichampe was immediately before him. He had heard his shout. The pursuers were now on the edge of the bay which the youth had entered. “To the gum-trees, Dexter, and watch that point— see that he does not gain the avenue. Keep him from crossing. Put in on the right, Beacham; and you, Mason, go in on the left. Spare him not! Slay him like a dog! No quarter to the spy!” These were his rapid orders to his men as they rushed into the close but narrow thicket which was called the bay. “But five minutes! give me that,” muttered Mellichampe to himself, “and I ask for no more. But where can Witherspoon be?” The next moment he heard the whistle of his friend in a denser part of the bay, and he hurried with a new joy towards him. 19* “There are but three or four—and, if we can but join first, we may give them work,” cried the youth, pressing forward. But Witherspoon was now already engaged. His voice kept pace in company with his sabre, the clashing of which Mellichampe heard while approaching him. The woodman had encountered one of the pursuers. The affair, however, was soon over. The man had met a sabre where he had looked only for a victim. “It's one less of the niggers,” cried Witherspoon, aloud, as he struck his enemy down with a fatal blow. “Hello! Airnest, boy, where is you?” But the youth could not answer. He himself was about to become busily engaged. Barsfield was before him, and between him and Witherspoon. Mellichampe had but his pistol, and he determined, as he saw the copse disturbed in front, to conceal his weapon, as he hoped that Barsfield would precipitate himself forward as if upon an unarmed enemy, when he might employ it suddenly and fatally. Indeed, he had no other chance for life. In part, his plan was successful. The tory leaped forward with a mad fury as he beheld the youth. His sabre was waving above Mellichampe's head, when the latter sank upon his knee and fired,—unerringly, but not fatally. The ball penetrated the thigh of the tory, who sank down upon him. They grappled with each other upon the ground, struggling in a little area where the trees seemed to have been scooped out, as it were, expressly to afford them room for a struggle of this sort. The physical power of Barsfield was naturally greater than that of Mellichampe, and the recent illness of the youth still farther increased the inequalities between them; but Mellichampe had succeeded in grasping the neckcloth of his enemy, while the latter had a hold only upon one wrist and part of the dress of the former. They were yet struggling upon the ground without advantage to either, when one of Barsfield's men came to his assistance. The moment was full of peril to the youth; but his friend Witherspoon was no less prompt to succour and save than the tory to destroy. He bounded through the intervening bushes in time to neutralize the efforts of the new-comer. A sabre-stroke from the woodman brought him to the ground, and disabled him from any movement towards the combatants; but, raising a pistol, even after he had fallen, before Witherspoon could help Mellichampe or get out of his way, he shot him in the side. Before he could draw a second the woodman cut him down. He had hardly done so, when a faintness came over the faithful fellow: he leaned against a tree, then sank nervelessly to the ground. “It's a tough shot, Airnest, and I can't help you. Who'd ha' thought it? Ah! it bites! But hold on, Airnest—hold on, boy; the major will soon come to pull you out of the bear's claws.” “You are hurt, Jack?” “Reckon I am—a bad hurt too, Airnest, if one may tell by the sort of feeling it has.” Without a word, Barsfield continued the struggle the more earnestly, as he now found himself becoming faint from the wound which Mellichampe had inflicted. The youth himself grew momently less and less able to resist his foe, and Witherspoon, who lay but a few feet apart, and saw the mutual efforts of the two, could lend no manner of assistance. The object of the tory was to keep Mellichampe quiet with one hand while he shortened his sabre with the other. This, as yet, he had striven fruitlessly to do. The youth, who saw his aim, had addressed all his energies to the task of defeating it; and, when pushed away by Barsfield, had contrived, by the grasp which he still maintained upon the neckcloth of the latter, still to cling so closely to him as to prevent his attainment of the desired object. While the struggle thus remained doubtful, a new party was added to the scene in the person of Scipio, who came stealing through the bushes. He had heard the clamour in that direction which had taken place at first, and the subsequent silence frightened him still more than all the noise of the previous struggle. He came to gain intelligence for his young mistress, whose apprehensions, though unuttered in language, or even in tears, were only silent because they were unutterable. Witherspoon saw the negro first. “Ha, Scip—nigger—is that you? Come quick, nigger, and help your mossa.” “Dah him—wha's de matter, Mass Wedderspoon— you hurt?” “Ask no questions, you black rascal, but run and help Airnest: don't you see him there, fighting with the tory?” “Who—Mass Airnest—fighting wid de tory,—hey?” The negro turned his eyes, and stood in amaze, to behold the sort of contest which Mellichampe and Barsfield carried on. The tory first addressed him— “Scipio, run to Lieutenant Clayton—” “Run to the devil!” cried Witherspoon; “knock him on the head, Scipio, and save your master,—don't let him talk.” “Only say de wud, Mass Wedderspoon,—say de wud, Mass Arnest,—you say I must knock dis tory?” “Yes, to be sure,” cried Witherspoon, in a rage. “If you dare,” said Barsfield, “you'll hang, scoundrel. Beware what you do—fly—go to Lieutenant Clayton—” The negro interrupted him— “You 'tan' for me, Mass Wedderspoon—you tell me fur do 'em, I do 'em fur true.” “Do it—do it, d—n you!—don't stand about it. He will kill Airnest if you don't,—he'll kill us all!” The negro seized a billet—a ragged knot of the richest pine wood that lay at hand,—and approached the two where they lay struggling— “I 'mos' 'fraid—he dah buckrah—I dah nigger.” “Strike him!” cried Witherspoon, writhing forward in an agony of excitement,—“strike him, Scip—I'll answer for you, boy.” “Hole you head fudder, Mass Arnest,” cried the negro,—“I 'feard for hit you.” “Will you dare, Scipio,—will you? Strike not, Scipio—you shall have your freedom—gold—guineas,” was the supplicating cry of Barsfield. “I no yerry you, Mass Barsfield—you's a d—n tory, I know. Dis dah my mossa,—I hab for mind um.” While he spoke, he approached and planted one of his feet between the bodies of the two combatants. “Turn you' eyes, Mass Arnest.” The heavy pine-wood knot was lifted above the head of the tory. The eyes of Mellichampe were averted, while Barsfield vainly strove to press forward as closely to the youth as possible, and once or twice writhed about in such a manner, though the grasp of Mellichampe was still upon his collar, as entirely to defeat the aim of the negro. “'Tan' 'till—I mus' knock you, Mass Barsfield.” “Scip—Scipio,” were the pleading tones of the tory, as he threw up his arms vainly. The blow descended and silenced him for ever. The billet was buried in his brains. The scull lay crushed and flattened, and but a single contraction of the limbs and convulsion of the frame attested the quick transition of life to death—so dreadful had been the stroke. Mellichampe had fainted. “Hurra!—hurra! Well done, Scip—well done,— you've saved the boy,—you're a nigger among a thousand!” The tones of exultation and encouragement came faintly from the lips of the woodman, who bled inwardly. They fell upon unheeding senses, for the stupified Scipio at that moment heard them not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">K 3 CHAPTER XXVIII. The negro dropped the heavy pine-knot with the blow, and, for a moment, stood gazing in stupor upon the horrid spectacle—his own deed—before him. At length, starting away, he dashed out of the bushes, in the direction of the dwelling, crying aloud as he fled, in tones like those of a maniac, and in words which indicated the intoxicating effect of his new-born experience upon him— “Ho! ho! I kill um—I hit um on he head. He's a dirt—he's a dirt—I hab foot on um—I mash he brains. Ho! ho! I kill buckrah. I's a nigger, I kill buckrah! You tink for hang me—you mistake. Mass Wedderspoon say de wud—Mass Arnest no say `no.' I kill 'em. He dead!” He rushed into the apartment where the family were all assembled in the highest degree of agitation. The storm of battle, which still raged around them with unmitigated fury, had terrified Mr. Berkeley and Rose Duncan to the last degree. They appealed to Scipio for information, but he gave them no heed. “Whay's young missis?—young missis I want. I hab for tell um someting.” He refused all other answer, and made his way into the adjoining apartment. Janet was at the window— that nearest to the clamour—at which, through another dreadful fight, she had watched unhesitatingly before. She started to her feet as she beheld him. “Ernest—speak to me, Scipio. What of Ernest? Where is he?—tell me he is safe.” “He dead!—I kill um!” She shrieked and fell. The event restored the negro to his senses. He picked her up, howling over her all the while, and bore her to the adjoining apartment, where the care of Rose Duncan in a short time recovered her. “Speak to me, Scipio,” she cried, rising, and addressing him with an energy which despair seemed to have given her, and which terrified all around—“Tell me all —what of Ernest? He is not hurt—he has escaped? You have told me falsely—he lives!” “I 'speck so, missis—'tis I's a d—n fool for tell you he been hurt. He no hurt. 'Tis Mass Barsfield I been knock on de head—” “Barsfield!—you!” was the exclamation of all. “Yes—de d—n nigger—enty he been hab Arnest 'pon de ground?—he want to 'tick him wid he sword. I take lightwood-knot, I hammer um on he head tell you sees noting but de blood and de brain, and de white ob he eye. He dead—'tis Scip mash um.” “You struck him, Scipio?” said Mr. Berkeley. “Mass Wedderspoon tell me, mossa. Enty he been guine 'tick Mass Arnest? When I see dat, I 'tan look. Jack Wedderspoon cuss me, and say—`why de hell you no knock um?' Well, wha' I for do? Enty he tell me? I knock um fur true! I hit um on he head wid de pine-knot. De head mash flat like pancake. I no see um 'gen.” The maidens shuddered at the narration, but Janet spoke instantly. “But Ernest—what of him, Scipio? Was he hurt? You have not said—is he safe?” “I sway, misses, I can't tell. I 'speck he been hurt someting. I left um on de ground. He ain't git up.” “I will go,” she exclaimed. “Think not of it, Janet, my child, till the noise is over.” But she had gone—while he yet spake, she had left the room and the house—Scipio closely attending her. The feebleness of age seemed no longer to oppress the aged man. He rushed after the daughter of his heart with much of the vigour of youth, and with all the fearlessness of a proper manhood. In that moment her worth was conspicuous, in his forgetfulness of all fear and feebleness. He heeded not the cries and the clamour— the dreadful imprecations and the sharp ringing shot, which momently assailed his ears in his progress. The fight was still going on along the avenue and in the park, but its fury was abating fast. Mr. Berkeley hurried forward, but soon became confused. His daughter was not to be seen, nor Scipio, and he knew not in what direction to turn his footsteps. While he paused and doubted, he heard the rush of cavalry, like the sweeping force of a torrent coming down the hills at midnight. He could see, in the bright moonlight, the dark figures and their shining white blades. The clashing of steel superseded the shot of the marksmen, and the horsemen now evidently swept the field in irresistible wrath. The tories were flying in all directions—the partisans riding over them with unsparing hoofs, and smiting down with impetuous steel. A group fled towards the house, and came directly upon the spot where the old man's feet seemed to be frozen. Timidly he shrank behind a tree, and, as the cavalry pursued, the tories broke, and dispersed in individual flight. One of them, an officer, sank back slowly, and with an air of resolution and defiance in his manner which soon provoked the attention of a partisan trooper. He pressed forward upon the Briton, who turned gallantly and made fight. The huge-limbed steed of the partisan was wheeled from side to side under the curb of his rider, with an ease that almost seemed the result of an instinct of his own. Neither the steed nor his rider could be mistaken. “Yield—surrender, sir—you prolong the fight uselessly. Your men are dispersed,” were the words of Singleton. `Never—to a rebel!” was the response of Clayton —`Never!” and he struck at the partisan with an earnestness and skill as he replied, which showed him that he was not an enemy to be trifled with. The fierce mood of Singleton grew uppermost as he witnessed the obduracy of the Briton. His own blows were repeated with furious energy, and the retreat of Clayton was, perforce, more rapid than before. Backing, and fighting all the while, his feet became entangled in some obstruction behind him, and he stumbled over it without being able to recover himself. He now lay at the mercy of his enemy. The courtesy of Singleton effected what his valour had not done. His horse was curbed in the instant which saw Clayton fall. The point of his sabre, which had been directed towards, was now turned from his bosom, and he bade him rise. The Briton bowed, and presented his sword. “Oblige me by keeping it, sir,” was the reply of the partisan. “Let me see you to the house in safety.” The only inmate of the house who received Lieutenant Clayton was Rose Duncan. “I am a prisoner, Miss Duncan,” said the lieutenant, and it did not pain him greatly to tell her so. “Indeed—I'm so glad of it,” was the almost unconscious reply. Clayton looked grave as she said so, and Major Singleton withdrew, leaving him, however, not so dissatisfied with the general tenour of events as might have been expected. It was surprising how soon he forgot that he was a prisoner, and how readily Rose became his custodier. But this concerns us not. In the neighbouring court the bugle of Marion called his men together. The battle was over. The victory was complete, and the only concern before the partisans was to ascertain the price which it had cost them. This could not be so readily determined. “But what tidings of Mellichampe?” demanded Marion. “Have you heard nothing, Major Singleton? This was your charge.” 20 “Nothing, as yet, sir—I have dispersed my men in search. It is unaccountable, too, that we have heard nothing of Witherspoon, nor has Captain Barsfield been reported. The command does not seem to have been with him. Lieutenant Clayton is my prisoner.” While they yet spoke, the whistle of Witherspoon—a faintly uttered note, but well known as that of the woodman—came to them from the bay. To this point they instantly proceeded. But Janet Berkeley was there long before them. She had outstripped even the speed of Scipio; she had heard and been guided by the accents of her lover's voice, as she entered the copse. “Jack, dear Jack—Witherspoon, my friend—my more than friend—my father—speak to me!” It was thus that the youth, bending over his prostrate companion, expressed his agony and apprehension at the condition in which he found him. Witherspoon bled inwardly, and could scarcely speak, as he was in momentary danger of suffocation. The next moment the arms of Janet were thrown about her lover, whom she found in safety, and she burst into an agony of tears, which at length relieved her. With her appearance, the strength and consciousness of the wounded woodman seemed to come back to him. He looked up with a smile, and said, feebly, as he beheld her— “God bless you, Miss Janet—and make you happy. You see he's safe—and there's no danger now, for I rether reckon, from what I hear and from what I don't hear, that the tories are done for.” “Oh, Mr. Witherspoon—what can I do for you? I hope you are not much hurt.” “Pretty bad, I tell you. I feel all over I can't tell how,—and when it comes to that, you see, it looks squally. I'm afeard I've no more business in the swamp.” “Speak not thus, Jack—but let us help you to the house. Here, Scipio, lend a hand.” But the woodman resisted them. “No! no!” he exclaimed, “this is my house—the woods. I've lived in them—and I feel that it will be sweeter to die in them, than in a dark little room. I like the green of the trees and the cool feel of the air. I can't breathe in a little room as I can in the woods.” “But, dear Jack, you can be better attended there— we—” “Don't talk, Airnest. I won't ax for much 'tendance now. I feel I'm going—my teeth stick when I set them down, and when I try to open them it's hard work. I'm in a bad way, I tell you, when I can't talk —talking was so nateral.” “What can I bring you?—” “Water!” he replied, gaspingly. But, with the effort to swallow, there came a rush of blood into his mouth which almost suffocated him. “It's all over with me now—Airnest, boy. I've done the best for you—” The youth squeezed his hand, but was too much moved to speak. “I've worked mighty hard to git you out of the hobble, and I'm awful glad that the bullet didn't come till you were safe out of the claws of that varmint. You've got a clear track now—and, oh! Miss Janet, I'm so glad to see you together, lock and lock, as I may say, afore I die. It's a God's blessing that I'm let to see it.” He linked their hands as he spoke, and the tears flowed from his eyes as if he had been a child. Nor were the two bending above him less moved. “When you're man and wife, you mustn't forget Jack Witherspoon. Ah, Airnest, you can't reckon how much he loved you.” “I know it—I feel it, Jack. Your present situation —this wound—” “I don't mind the pain of it, Airnest, when I think that I saved you. You're safe—and 'tain't no hard matter to die when one's done all his business. Indeed, to say truth, it's high time—Ah! it's like a wild-cat gnawing into the bones!” The dialogue, broken and interrupted frequently by the sorrow of the spectators and the agonizing pain of Witherspoon, was at length interrupted by the entrance into the area of the partisan general, with several of the officers. Marion spoke in a low tone to Scipio, who stood at the head of the dying man. The voice was recognised by him. “That's the gineral—the old `fox,”' he muttered to himself, and he strove to throw back his eyes sufficiently to see him. “Stand out of the moonlight, nigger—I wants to see the gineral.” “I am here, Thumbscrew,” said Marion, kneeling down beside him. “How is it with you, my friend?” “Bad enough, gineral. You'll have to put me in the odd leaf of the orderly's book. I've got my certificate.” “I hope not, Thumby. We must see what can be done for you. We can't spare any of our men,” said Marion, encouragingly. The dying man smiled feebly as he spoke again, “I know you can't, and that makes me more sorry But you know me, gineral—wasn't I a whig from the first?” “I believe it—I know it. You have done your duty always.” “Put that down in the orderly book—I was a whig from the first.” “I will,” said Marion. “And after it, put down agen—he was a whig to the last.” “I will.” “Put down—he never believed in the tories, and—” here he paused chokingly from a fit of coughing—“and he always made them believe in him.” “You have done nobly in the good cause, John Witherspoon,” said the general, while his eyes were filled with tears, “and you may well believe that Francis Marion, who honours you, will protect your memory. Here is my hand.” The woodman pressed it to his lips. “Airnest—” The youth bent over him. The arms of the dying man were lifted—they clasped him round with a fervent grasp, and brought his forehead down to his lips— “Airnest!” he exclaimed once more, and then his grasp was relaxed. He lay cold and lifeless—the rude but noble spirit had gone from the humble but honourable dwelling, which it had informed and elevated. The grief of Ernest Mellichampe was speechless; and if the happiness of the pair, united in the sweetest bonds by the hands of the dying man, in that hour of pain, was ever darkened with a sorrow, it was when they thought that he who had served them so faithfully had not been permitted to behold it.
