      <field name="fulltext">DISTRICT OF MARYLAN, ss. SEAL. Be it remembered, That on this twentieth day of February, in the forty-seventh year of the Independence of the United States of America, Joseph Robinson, of the said District, hath deposited in this office, the Title of a Book, the right whereof he claims as Proprietor, in the words following; to wit: “Seventy-Six.” By the author of Logan. “Our Country!—right or wrong.” In conformity to an Act of the Congress of the United States, entitled, “An Act for the encouragement of Learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned,” and also to the Act, entitled, “An Act supplementary to the Act, entitled, An Act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of Maps, Charts, and Books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies during the times therein mentioned, and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of Designing, Engraving, and Etching, historical and other prints.” PHILIP MOORE, Clerk of the District of Maryland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. To * * * * * * To you, my beloved Sister, I offer these two volumes, because, with all their infirmities, I do not believe them to be unworthy of myself, or you. — —. New-York, Jan. 1, 1823.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I wrote Logan for an experiment. My object was, to do what nobody else had done, or would have the impudence to attempt. I succeeded—but perhaps, it would have been better for me, had I failed. I have written Seventy-Six, for another, and a better reason. I have written it, in the hope that they, who have been bothered and frightened, with the rambling incoherency, passion and extravagance of Logan, may have an opportunity of getting into a better humour, with the author; and, if possible, with themselves. Logan, I find, has been attributed to several persons, most of whom are remarkable for nothing but belles-lettres-foppery, and pretension;— and the rest are mad—stark, staring mad: nay, one of them, I believe, is actually under confinement, while I am writing, in the Pennsylvania hospital. I feel the compliment. It is highly creditable to the good sense of the publick. And I do not despair of hearing Seventy-Six attributed to some other ninnyhammer, quite as foolish, if not quite so outrageous. But, whatever be the reception of Seventy-Six, I shall feel neither gratitude nor resentment toward the publick. I have lived long enough to know that they are never right, where it is possible to be wrong; that popularity is no proof of merit; and, that sudden popularity is never the reward of great talent. And I have come to the conclusion that, whatever may be the neglect of the publick, it is more comfortable for an author to attribute it to— bad printing—bad paper—want of zeal in the publisher; stupidity—obstinacy—bad taste—prejudice —degeneracy, or infatuation, in the literary world; to a competition among trunk-makers, and grocers—nay, to any thing and every thing, rather than to incompetency in himself. That is my rule—and I have found great comfort in the application of it. On the other hand, however successful an author may be, he will be a hypocrite or a fool, if he pretend to feel any gratitude to the publick, for their favour. He ought to remember that the obligation is as much their's as his: and that they would see him, and his family, perish, inch by inch, in starvation and wretchedness, before they would buy his book, unless they had their money's worth. So—Mr. Publisher, I will have no gratitude expressed for me, whatever may be the sale of my book. I shall feel none; and, I would sooner burn the edition, than be suspected of it. See that you do not commit me, therefore, in any of your advertisements. THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 2 CHAPTER I. “Our Fathers!....Where are they?”....Bible. Yes, my children, I will no longer delay it. We are passing, one by one, from the place of contention, one after another, to the grave; and, in a little time, you may say—Our Fathers!—the men of the Revolution— where are they?..... Yes, I will go about it, in earnest: I will leave the record behind me, and when there is nothing else to remind you of your father, and your children's children, of their ancestor—nothing else, to call up his apparition before you, that you may see his aged and worn forehead—his white hair in the wind... you will have but to open the book, that I shall leave to you—and lay your right hand, devoutly, upon the page. It will have been written in blood and sweat, with prayer and weeping. But do that— no matter when it is, generations may have passed away—no matter where I am—my flesh and blood may have returned to their original element, or taken innumerable shapes of loveliness—my very soul may be standing in the presence of the Most High—Yet do ye this, and I will appear to you, instantly, in the deepest and dimmest solitude of your memory!— —Yes!—I will go about it, this very day... And I do pray you and them, as they shall be born successively of you, and yours, when all the family are about their sanctuary, their own fire side—the holy and comfortable place, to open the volume, and read it aloud. Let it be in the depth of winter, if it may be, when the labour of the year is over, and the heart is rejoicing in its home—and when you are alone:—not that I would frown upon the traveller, or blight the warm hospitality of your nature, by reproof—but there are some things, and some places, where the thought of the stranger is intrusion, the touch and hearing of the unknown man, little better than profanation. If you love each other, you will not go abroad for consolation: and if you are wise, you will preserve some hidden, fountains of your heart, unvisited but by one or two—the dearest and the best. This should be one of them—I will have it so. I would not have your feeling of holy, and solemn, and high enthusiasm, broken in upon, by the unprepared, just when you have been brought, perhaps, to travel in imagination, with your father, barefooted, over the frozen ground, leaving his blood at every step, as he went, desolate, famished, sick, naked, almost broken hearted, and almost alone, to fight the battles of your country. No!—I would have your thought go in pilgrimage, over the same ground, remembering that the old men who travelled it, in the revolution, doing battle at every step, for your inheritance, were an army journeying, deliberately, to martyrdom. Do this my children—and let it be a matter of religion with you: teach your children to do the same. Let every place of especial trial and bloodshed, be a Mecca to you and to them—and God's blessing shall be upon you, forever and ever! We have had many a history of our country, many of the revolution; but none written by men acquainted, by participation therein, with our sorrow, and trial, and suffering: not one, where the mighty outline of truth is distinctly visible—no, not one. I make no exception. All of them are in my mind, at this moment—there is not one. We wrestled, children as we were, for eight years, with armed giants: and wrenched—wrenched! with our own hands, the spoil from the spoiler—overcame them all, at last, after eight years of mortal trial, and uninterrupted battle, even in their strong hold. I was one of them that helped to do this. There is a vividness in my recollection that cannot deceive me. I knew personally, and intimately, the leading men in this drama. Most of them have gone down to their graves, dishonoured and trampled upon, in their old age:—many are yet wandering, helpless and dejected, among the beautiful and vast proportions of that edifice, which they built up with their blood and bones—like the spirits of venerable men, that have been driven away from their dwelling places by banditti—and died in a foreign land:—like shadowy sovereigns, coming back to a degenerate people, haunting the chambers of their greatness, in olden time, and re-treading, with an air of authority and dominion—which is the scorn and mockery of men, whose fathers could not have stood upright in their awful presence—the courts where they have been dethroned—the ancient palaces, which they built with their own power and treasure— and from which they have been banished, day by day, with insult and derision —yet, at my bidding they will appear! and harness and array themselves— and stand before you, as I have seen them stand before George Washington—a battalion of immoveable, impregnable, unconquerable old men. I am familiar with all that they thought and did, they that were about me, I mean, from the time that I went among them a passionate, wild boy, till I came out from them, battered and worn, and bruised and broken and scarred all over, with the deep cabala of premature old age. None but an eye witness can tell, as it ought to be told, the story of individual suffering, protracted for such a time, the tale of individual heroism, continued year after year, under privation, cruelty, insult and toil, beyond all that the men of Rome or of Macedon, under Alexander himself, would have borne, in the spring tide of their heart's valour. Yes—though I would tell the tale before I die—old as I am, frail as the tenure is, by which I hold to the earth, I must take my own time for it, and tell that which I do tell, with the plainness and honesty of my nature, so that you may depend upon it. You know that I will tell you nothing which I do not know to be true. I need not add, therefore, that, where there is a disagreement between my story, and that which you will find in the blundering, tedious compilations, which are called the Histories of our Revolution, you will do well to rely upon mine. Let this be copied, in a fair hand by Frederick, and during the next week, I will forward you two or three sheets more. Make no alteration in it—no corrections. If there be any part illegible, leave a blank, till I have an opportunity of supplying it. I would have this a family relick, the legitimate production of your father, an uneducated, plain soldier, and of him alone. It will then grow every year, in your veneration: gain every year, upon your heart, in solemnity and interest. Nay—let this intimation take a higher authority. I know the sacredness of ancient things—I command you therefore, that you lay not your hand upon one letter of what I write. Men do not talk now as they used to—you see none of the old fashioned kingly-looking people in this generation... nothing of their high carriage and attitude—hear nothing of their powerful voices, and regal tread—their thought, the currency of their heart is base and degenerate—it wears no longer the stamp of sovereignty—is no longer the coinage of God's kingdom—but the paltry counterfeit thereof— base and showy. No—trust them not. Hold what there is left to you, of other days, as the regalia of giants; to be visited only, by torch light, with downcast eyes and folded arms. Ye are a fettered people— fettered too, by manacles that would have fallen from the limbs of your fathers like rain—dropped from them, in the indignant heat of their mighty hearts, like the leaden entrenchments of a furnace. My children.—It has been my nature, from my childhood, to speak and write for myself. There are few men upon this earth, in whom it would not be presumption to alter what I have written. And you, my children, are not of their number. In you, it would be wicked and foolish. It would lead to a perpetual discussion, in your family, about the genuineness of the VOL.

My blessing shall not abide upon him that dares to add, alter, or leave out, one jot or tittle of the whole. No—let it go down, with your blood, the patent of your nobility, to the elder son, forever and ever; and when you are able, multiply the copies among all that are descended from me, as the last legacy, of one, that it would be an honour to them, whatever they may become, to be the posterity of. My style may often offend you. I do not doubt that it will. I hope that it will. It will be remembered the better. It will be the style of a soldier, plain and direct, where facts are to be narrated; of a man, roused and inflamed, when the nature of man is outraged— of a father—a husband—a lover and a child, as the tale is of one, or of the other. You have all had a better education than your father. You have, most of you, a pleasant and graceful way of expressing yourselves on paper—and there is one among you—you know which I mean—the operations of whose mind are as vivid and instantaneous, and beautiful, as flashes of coloured light—but there is not one among you—not one, that has yet learnt to talk on paper. Learn that—learn it speedily—there is no time to be lost. Farewell, my children, farewell: till the next mail. I shall expect you, a week, at least, before Christmas. JONATHAN OADLEY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “Thy spirit, Independence! let me share! “Lord of the Lion-heart and Eagle eye! “Thy steps I follow, with my bosom bare, “Nor heed the storm that howls along the sky.” After reflecting a good deal upon the subject, my dear children, I have come to the conclusion, that, if I interweave with the history, which I have promised to you, some account of myself and Archibald, of whom you have heard me relate so many things that made your nerves shiver, as with electricity, when you were mere boys, it will do much toward perpetuating the history of our family, and keeping your attention alive to the order of events. And that, at the end of another generation, my posterity may not have to inquire, who and what were their ancestors, I will begin my narrative, with a rapid sketch of our family, so far as there are now any traces of them left. I find a tradition among us that we are of Scotch extraction; and, by looking into the records of our oldest colony, as Plymouth, you will find a constant reference to the name of Oadley, as to one of influence and authority. My grandfather, I know, was born in a part of New England, since called the New Hampshire Grants, and, yet more recently, composing a part of the newly made State of Vermont:—and I have heard my father relate several anecdotes of his warlike and adventurous character. It was he that headed the party against King Philip, as he was called, the Indian of Mount Hope, the season before his death, and he was the very man that grappled with him, in the midst of his young men, who had decoyed the party into an ambush,—thereby, as you will remember, holding Philip as a hostage, even in the centre of his wigwam, till he was compelled to forgo the whole profit of his adventure.... and he it was, who threw up his commission, before the Plymouth fathers, and broke his sword, and swore by the Everlasting God that he would never draw another, after the shameful treachery that had been practiced upon that wary, but high hearted Indian, at the time of his assassination. Nor did he, till his dying day. I can but just recollect him. He was a very erect, stately, stern old man, of few words, and remarkable stature. This is all that I can recollect of him, except that he used to talk to the militia of the day, as if they were children, and relate, with a distinctness that made my young heart swell violently, many an inroad of the Indians. My father, as most of you well remember, was a pacifick, mild, kind hearted man; and if I add to this, that, after he removed from Providence Plantations to the Jerseys, he never saw blood drawn, till the flame of the revolution had broken out, you will then know about all that any man knows of his early life. Till within the last ten years of his life, there was the same plain, unpretending, substantial good sense in all that he did; and during many years that we lived together, I do not remember that I ever saw him in a passion but twice or three times; and the first left such an impression on my mind, that I will relate it—it was on seeing my good mother, in the pride of her beauty, equipped in a new calico gown, flowered all over with yellow and blue roses, about the size of cabbages,—after the new importation confederacy had been adopted.—The affair had been managed secretly, and my mother might have passed it all off, without the loss of her finery, or the rebuke that she received, had she been able to suppress, a little more, her natural spirit for display; but unfortunately, she could not, and she had passed, and repassed, before my father, during the first day, so frequently, in her flaming ruffles and furbelows, that human patience could endure it no longer—“Peggy,” said my father —“what is the meaning of this?” She smiled, coloured, bridled a little, and turned about, so as to exhibit all the proportions of her finely turned waist—before she answered. I was but a little fellow, scarcely old enough to speak my own name, so as to be understood; but my father's anger so frightened me, it being the first explosion, that I could not think of it, for sometime afterward, without looking behind me, and holding my breath. My mother was the “lady” of the neighbourhood, and but for one other lady, would have been the happiest of human creatures. “O, my dear;” said she, coaxingly—“only a little “spec of mine; I was going to drink tea, with our “neighbour Arnauld, and I thought— “Drink tea!”—said my father, shutting his bible, with a clap that made me start—and standing erect— You remember his height—few men carried such a front with them, and of all our blood, he was the tallest, I believe.—“Drink tea, Peggy—Do you not “know, child, that tea is one of the prohibited “things?” My father alluded to the confederacy that had just been entered into, by all the substantial men of the country, some in shame, some in terrour, and some from downright honesty and virtue, not to purchase or consume any article whatever, supplied by the mother country to the colonies; and tea was one of the enumerated articles. My mother turned pale, I remember, but continued for a moment or two, to defend the visit and tea drinking stoutly—but my father was immoveable. “Woman!” said he, putting his large hand kindly, but authoritively, upon her shoulder—“while you are “my wife, not one cup of tea shall pass your lips— “unless the confederacy be abandoned—And if your “neighbour—” This neighbour, by the way, lived eight miles off, at the end of an almost inaccessible wood, and was the lady rival of my mother.— —“be weak and wicked enough to treat her visiters, “in the present state of her country, with tea, you “shall never, with my leave, set your foot within her “doors again.”— “High times indeed!” said my mother, bouncing away from his hand, (she was the younger, by at least twelve years; and that gave her an advantage, not to be overlooked by a handsome and adroit woman) “High times indeed! Jonathan Oadley” (his name too, was Jonathan, as you will recollect)—“when a body “cannot be allowed to take a drop of tea for “medicine”— “A drop of hell fire!” cried my father, stamping with wrath—“A woman of America! the wife of Jo “nathan Oadley—whose husband has signed a paper “with his own blood” (a literal fact, my children, for, in the feeling of the time, no solemnity, and I might say, no superstition was spared) “calling down the “anger of God upon his house, and his wife, and child “ren, if he kept it not—shall she be the first to “laugh his obligation to scorn—give his household to “destruction, and her husband's name to dishonour. “—O, for shame!”— I am sure, even now, that, had my father been less violent, by a little, than he was, there would have been no trouble in the affair; but my mother was a high spirited woman, remarkably well bred for the time, and had married him, in the face and eyes of all her family— “Ye—ye—yes,” said she sobbing—“just what I “expected. I was always t—t—told so—I—” “That I was a tyrant?” said my father gently— “no Peggy, no—I am no tyrant—but much, as I love “you, and that boy yonder, I would rather lose “you both, rather see you taking a mortal poison, “both of you, than a cup of this accursed tea:—but “what is this—what is the meaning of this?” (taking hold, of the long ruffle, or flounce, at the elbow of her glittering calico)—“new—is it—Peggy!— My mother held down her head, whether in shame and mortification, or in sullenness, I know not—but there was an awful stillness for a minute or two,—and then my father went up to her, and took her in his arms and kissed her—I declare to you my children, like some high priest, about to offer up a living creatures that he loved, in sacrifice.— He was very pale, and, after uttering a few words, my mother began, very reluctantly, to unfasten her girdle.—My notion was from my own experience in such matters and the sternness of his countenance, and the terrour and shame in her's, that he was going to beat her, and I began to cry lustily; but they gave no heed to my bawling, and I never stopped, even to get my breath, till I had seen the beautiful calico gown, torn into five hundred pieces, and burnt in the fire—my mother clad anew, in a dark brown cotton of her own weaving, and my father sitting by her, with his arm round her waist, and her head leaning upon his shoulder, full of affection and duty.— Thus much for my father's temper: it will give you some notion of his general deportment, when I tell you that I never saw him transported so far on any other occasion, for more than twenty years. Nothing else, I am persuaded, could have disturbed him, like this wavering of allegiance in his wife. He loved her ardently—truly—but he loved her like a man. And as he never warmed but on one theme—till the cry for independence, rang like a trumpet throughout the mountains—and that was, whenever the character of her father, the man of war, was named, I have had no better opportunity of seeing his nature than you, yourselves, have had, till within a few years of his death. My infancy, boyhood, and manhood too, I might say, were spent, much as they are with most of the world, who are born apart from all but a few sober, plain dealing country neighbours;—for I was nearly twenty-two, and probably the stoutest fellow of my age in the whole country; and Archibald, a poor weakly creature, about twenty, when the war of the revolution broke out, and gave to our characters, and that of my father, a strange, unexpected power, revealing many deeply hidden properties, that might have been, and no doubt, would have been buried for ever, but for the events that I am now about to relate. We were very happy; and though we heard of the war, and the numerous temptations of bounty and equipment, and advance, even at our own doors, from the continental recruiting officers that came among us, yet nobody, from our neighbourhood, seemed to regard it as a possible thing, for one of us, to go really and truly into battle. We read of such things, and talked of them; but, some how or other, it never entered our head, that they who did such feats as we were told of, were flesh and blood, like ourselves, raw countrymen who would turn pale, in the beginning of a campaign, at the sight of blood; and stand up, before it had finished, like a veteran, before the roar of artillery, and rattling of bullets, and the sure approach of the bayonet.— None of our neighbours had actually gone into service, though several had threatened violently, just before the affair of Long Island, and the abandonment of Fort Lee and Washington; but when they happened, one after the other, with some other disasters, in such rapid succession, it is too true my children, that the stout hearted among us began to look about for darkness to cover them. Sir Henry Clinton was now in New York; our army had dwindled down to a few miserable battalions, with no cavalry; and Cornwallis was mustering in the rear of poor Washington, who really began to totter, even in the estimation of my father. We were about fourteen miles from the high road, over which our countrymen were afterwards hunted by Sir William Howe; and already we had heard “the drum beat at dead of night,” and seen, away on the verge of the horizon, the red light of farm houses, set fire to, by the royal banditti: and once I remember, when my cousin Arthur, a fine, free spirited fellow, and Archibald and I, were out upon a high hill, late in the afternoon, we heard a heavy cannonading in the east, and were soon after told that there had been a bloody affair, with some of the outposts, that Sir Henry Clinton had established to protect his foraging parties. In the evening as we sat together, in a mournful silence, Arthur, at last, with a deep sigh, turning to my father, asked him what he thought of the matter?— The old man shook his head: and his large bony hands, as they lay on the table before him, were raised, for a moment, with a convulsive pressure,—and then he shook his head again. “A dreary winter, father;” said I,—“and the farmers complain bitterly of the depredations committed by their own countrymen.”— There was another deep silence, of some minutes, when the old man groaned aloud, as if his heart were in travail— Archibald arose, and went to him, and put his hand upon his shoulder, in that silent, strange way, which was so natural to him, even when a boy, and lifting his deep blue eyes, with a melancholy look of determination, said— “Surely, sir, you do not complain of these things?” “no Archy,” replied my father, putting his arm round his waist, “no my boy, I do not complain that my “cattle are driven away from me, to feed the poor fel “lows in camp; for I know that Washington has no “other way of feeding them, particularly since the “removal of Commissary Trumbull,—but I do com “plain when I see my cattle slaughtered and hewed to “pieces, in my barn yard, and left there, weltering “in their blood, by the savages that are detached from “our Army!” `Father!'—said Archibald, retreating two or three paces, folding his arms, and looking him in the face, as if he thought that he had not heard him aright— VOL. I. 3 “I know what you are thinking, Archibald,” said my father: “and I cannot blame you. You have not forgotten my words, when the Declaration of Independence was read to us—have you?” “No Sir!” said my brother, his pale face growing still paler, and his slender form shivering with the depth and excess of some inward and unknown feeling —and then added, in a manner that awed me, as much as if a dumb creature had suddenly found his tongue— for such had been the melancholy, deep and solemn abstraction of his nature, from the age of about eighteen, that we had learnt never to attempt any conversation with him, leaving him alone and unmolested to his thought, as a poor distempered creature, whom it was a pity to worry in his humours:—and now, when he broke out upon us, much after the following fashion, our amazement held us speechless; and that of my father was dashed with a feeling of shame, that even I could see, for the red blood shot over his temples, and up through his bald forehead, showing that he felt the rebuke of Archibald—even to his old heart. “No Sir! I have not forgotten it;” said my brother, standing motionless before him—“And I did believe that not one of this house would ever forget it. But now!—now in the time of his tribulation, when all that is dearest to us, our home and Country, is about to be laid waste with fire and sword,—they that have sworn to stand by George Washington, though Heaven itself rained fire upon their heads—(your own words Sir)—are the first to abandon him—withhold their succour—drive off their cattle to the woods—bury their provisions—and refuse the currency of the country— nay more!—the first, to quail at the sound of cannon— the first to lay their hands upon their own children, and say, you shall not fight the battles of your country.” —He faltered, as he concluded, and when he had done, and the echo of his own words came back loudly to him from the ceiling, he started—and looked about him, with a troubled air, for a moment, and then put his thin hands to his forehead and buried them slowly in his rich brown hair, as if astonished at the sound of his own voice. Nor were we less so—my cousin Arthur and I exchanged two or three glances, and the fire streamed from his black eyes, as he ran up to Archibald, and seized him by both his hands, and shook them, for a whole minute, as if he would shake them off, trying two or three times, but in vain, to speak—and at last turning away, and wiping his eyes—without uttering a word.— “Archibald,” said my father, rising majestically, and coming forward to meet him, “it is hard to abide the upbraiding of a child, our own child, our youngest born”— Archibald's head drooped, and the red heat went all over it—like the light of a furnace. —“Yet it is harder,” continued my father, “to bear that of our own heart”—(laying both of his hands, emphatically, upon his left breast, as he spoke)—“what would you have me do?” It was a whole minute before Archibald replied, and his chin worked up and down, all the while of his preparation, and a mortal lividness overspread his face, while his long, dark eyelashes gave an animated sadness and shadow to his beautiful eyes—and when he did reply, it was, by lifting his head, slowly, to our father's, planting his foot, and compressing his folded arms upon his chest, as if to keep down a rebellion there— “Shall I speak the truth?” said he; “assuredly” answered my father, while Arthur pressed up to me, and whispered,—“what possesses the creature?—is that Archibald—the weak, peevish boy?”—I shook my head; I knew not what to think of it. “Well then,” continued Archibald, in a voice that was just audible? `You ask me what I would have you do? I answer thus. Sell all that you have. Give all that you have to your country. Shoulder your knapsack, put another upon John, (he always called me John), and another upon me; let each of us take his course through the country, and collect as many as he can, of the stout yeomanry—and then go before George Washington, and tell him to be of good cheer, for, come what will, we, at least, will abide with him to the death.” My father shook his head, but embraced Archibald, and kissed his white forehead a dozen times at least, before he answered. “I am proud of your spirit, Archy,” said he—“but I cannot say much for your wisdom. What!—in the darkest time of our trial, when the bravest of all the land are hiding themselves in dismay, shall I be the first to let out my whole blood, at once, in desperation!” “Yes—Yes!—now is the time!—father—now! even now!” cried Archibald, pressing upon him. “One such example would electrify the country! What! would you stand by, and see our little army beaten, man by man, and wait for a miraculous interposition of Heaven, for their relief? No! my father! give but the signal—here are four of us already, and before tomorrow night, I will put my head upon the issue, that I carry forty more with me, on the way to Washington's camp. Do this—and before the winter is gone, he will have turned upon his enemy, and beaten him back into his hiding places—what say you, shall we buckle on our blankets?” As he said this, he took down an old rifle that lay athwart the smoked pannel work, over the fire place, and leant upon it, with a face all on fire—but my father put out his spirit immediately, with a smile, as he said— “No, my boy, Washington would hardly thank me for an army of such striplings.” Archibald bit his lip. “Three of us” said he, “are stout men—you, and John, and Arthur—and—” “Arthur may do as he pleases;” said my father, “and as for John—from this moment, he hath my consent to shoulder his musquet—” “And join the army!” shouted Archibald, leaping from the floor—“O, do let me go with him—I—I—I am not very strong, but I can—” “No, Archibald, I cannot part with you. Your constitution is too delicate.” “The best way to harden it, father,” said he— “Your temper too unsocial and passionate—” “The best way to cure that—” “Silence!—I will not hear another word upon the subject. John may depart whenever he pleases, and, if Arthur will go, he may have his choice of the horses, and I will furnish both, as well as money can do it, with equipments—but as for you, I will not part with you. They are strong handsome fellows, and will work their way through the battle, I'll warrant them, but as for you, the first thing that I should hear of you, would be, that you had been run away with by your own horse, or trodden to death in the onset— no—You shall be a minister, Archibald—a minister of the Gospel.” Archibald looked at him, a moment, as if—I hardly dare to say what, for he was the most affectionate creature in the world, and till that hour, I had never heard him speak a loud word in the presence of my father— he had always set apart by himself, musing all the day long, over some history, or drawing:—but it did appear to me that, all at once, his soul felt new strength, and that, before the sound of my father's voice had died away, declaring that he should be a minister of the gospel—he had determined to be torn in pieces, first, by wild horses—but he bowed his head reverentially, to my father, (who left us for awhile,) and went into the darkest corner of the room;—where he stood for a whole hour, without opening his lips. “Well Jonathan,” said my father, returning—“what say you—when will you go?” I felt my heart stop—partly with shame, and partly with fear—till he repeated the question, and I saw Archibald's eyes flashing, impatiently, for my answer— VOL. I. 3* “whenever you please, Sir,” said I—though I would have given the world to be out of the affair. “Tomorrow then,” said Arthur “rubbing his hands. The sorrel mare for me—Hobson's choice for you— and the next morning at day light, hourra for the camp!”— I have determined not to disguise one feeling of my heart, nor one thought of fear, my children; for I would have you know me thoroughly; and, therefore, I must own to you that I wondered at the enthusiasm of Arthur, and would have given my right hand, that the proposition had not been made: but I was ashamed to appear less of a man than Arthur, who was a whole year younger, and therefore, I answered stoutly, “Tomorrow be it then”— My father embraced me, and there was a look of encouragement in the face of my brother, that made me run up to him; when he caught my hand, and wrung it with all his might, while the tears rushed into his eyes—and he said, “O brother, would God that I were as strong and handsome as you.” Arthur arose to go. “No, my lad,” said my father, “you will take a bed with me to-night, and tomorrow, go round to your acquaintances, with Arthur and Archy---they shall both go with you---and bid them good bye---I will take care, to represent the matter rightly to your uncle. It is really time, that we did something. I am ashamed of myself. Our cause must perish, if all abandon it, as I have done. No, I will mount and ride, tomorrow, through all the neighbourhood, and never rest, till I have stirred up some of our substantial men---for they are the most backward, after all--- they have nothing to gain, and much to lose---and they, like me, have been lying by, to see the sun break out, before they go abroad. No!---it shall not be so another day. I will go to them myself, and if that doesn't work upon them, I will let the minister loose---ha! Archy, what say you---silent?---well, well, I like your contemplative spirit---so fond of study.” I heard something fall, and turning to where he stood, saw that the book, which he had been holding, had fallen from his hand, but he did not appear to observe it. “No!” continued my father, “we must be ready to begin the next campaign, with spirit, or the devil will be to pay—one bold, manly effort, and we shall down with our invader to the dust—tomorrow, I will throw open my barn, and stable, and corn houses, and let the first foraging party, that will, empty them all—and set fire to the ruins. I will never complain more!—what say you Archy?—will that do!—come, come, cheer up—you shall stay by your old father and mother, and comfort them, while Jonathan is cutting and slashing at the enemy—so, hourra for independence!” “Hourra! hourra!” shouted Arthur, swinging the old rifle round his head—“hourra for independence!” My voice followed his, but so faintly, that it sounded like an echo, only—while Archibald merely locked his hands, and uplifted them, to heaven—much to the delight of the old gentleman, who winked at us, and smiled, as if it were some timely revelation from above ---“yes! yes!---said he---he was made for a minister.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. III. “What steed to the desert flies fast and afar! * * * * * * —no rider is there; “And the bridle is red with the sign of despair.” Never, in all my life, did I pass such a night as that, which followed the conversation that I have just related. I know not whether I was born with a more timorous heart than other men; but I have been ready to believe, when I have seen their indifference to matters of life and death, where we have stood together, ankle deep in blood—their cold, phlegmatick, habitual disregard of what made my heart feel, sometimes, as if it were turning to stone within me, and my flesh crawl— that they were fashioned originally, and by constitution, of sterner material than myself—and yet, I have seen Archibald too, pale as death, in the awful stillness that preceded the first shot, while they went on, immoveable and solid as a phalanx of machinery, with no sweat upon their foreheads, no prayer upon their lips, no knocking at their ribs.—What then should I think? His courage was indisputable—yet he was abundantly more agitated than myself.—However, not to anticipate, there were a thousand apprehensions, natural to an inexperienced country lad, like myself, about to abandon the roof of his father, mingled and dashed too, with some pleasant and adventurous feeling, common, I dare say, to the high in blood, whatever may be their courage;—but there were some perils— some, that the terrour of, would not let me sleep. The small pox was in the American army, and its ravages were tremendous, as we were told, and believed:—add to this, that Cornwallis had just moved upon our frontiers, with the design of effecting a junction between his army and that of Sir Henry Clinton, then in possession of New York.—Their forces, exceeding fifty five thousand men, were well known to be admirably appointed, and altogether superior to ours. Arnold had been beaten—and we had just lost the command of the lakes—and Fort Pitt, too, had fallen. —several perilous changes had been made in the Staff —General Schuyler and Gates were at loggerheads— Washington himself, was losing a part of his popularity—and they were intriguing to set him aside, not by a dismissal, but by passing a vote of censure upon him, which they knew the great man would not brook —the army had dwindled to nothing, by the folly and madness of short enlistments, and literally, nothing at all had been done, on our part, during the campaign— nothing experienced, but a series of defeat and humiliation, which no human being could have held up against, except George Washington.— —Such was the state of affairs at this time; and if you add to these facts, which were painful and disheartening enough, to intimidate and bow the bravest, the ten thousand rumours and exaggerations perpetually afloat—the fact that we were safer under the protection of the enemy than of our own countrymen— the different appearance of our tatterdemalions, half naked, half armed, and half starved, from their invaders, a gallant, and dazzling army with banners and trumpets,—and the offer of pardon and mercy, just made by Sir William Howe, at the head of thirty thousand veterans, offers which were not only made to, but were accepted far and near, by the dastardly gentry (for the poor held out—in their nakedness and poverty, to their last breath)—and the threat, constantly reiterated, that all the prisoners of war would be hung for rebels and traitors, and never exchanged— you will not wonder that my heart was heavy at the thought of what I was about to encounter. However, the night wore away, at last, and never did the morning light break in upon me with such influences; my blood danced in my body, and before I had been out in the wind an hour---a fine, frosty air, with a few stars, yet visible, and the bluest sky that I ever saw, above me, I do believe that I could have gone into battle, with less terrour than I had heard the proposal to go, ten or twelve hours before. Such is the steadying effect of contemplation; such is it, to be prepared—and such the strengthening of God's breath, when it blows down from the mountain upon us, before sun rise. It would revive a dead man—I have sometimes thought, when I was galloping away before it, for life and death, almost:---but Arthur appeared the same frank, cordial, carcless fellow, in the morning, that I had always found him. He was one of them, that take whatever happens, in this world of commotion and trial, as a sort of thing, not to be troubled about. “Well, John,” said he, clapping me on the shoulder, retreating about forty yards, and levelling his rifle at my head, “let me see if you can stand fire?” I started, in good earnest, for it went off, and the ball whistled, through my head, I thought, for a moment---but it certainly passed very near me. “Better than you, cousin, I am sure!” said I, forgetting my consternation, in looking at the sudden change, and frightful expression of his face. “Gad a mercy!” he cried—“whew!”—stopping a moment to see if I would fall, and then running up to me, and feeling all about my head, like a delirious creature, for a minute or two—“bless my heart and soul!—whew!—well how do you feel?—d—n that rifle—it goes off, without touching the trigger—it only jarred in my hand.” “Yes!” said I, rising forty fold in my own estimation, to find that I was so little discomposed by an accident, that had well nigh settled the campaign with me, forever and ever—and shaken poor Arthur's courage into dust—“yes—but if you do not aim better than that, when you get among the Virginia riflemen —Morgan's men—they'll—” “Don't talk to me---don't talk,” cried Arthur, choking with joy and terrour—while his black eyes actually ran over, and he trembled, from head to foot. “Well” said Archibald, joining us with a prouder step than common, “you are harnessing, for the war, I see, my brave brother; and you too, cousin Arthur— have you made up your minds, never to return—never to lay down your arms—never! never! till—ha! what's all this—by heaven, it cannot be”—(catching Arthur by the arm, and turning him partly round, for he was stooping, as if to tighten the girth of his horse, but had remained there rather too long a time for the impatient temper of Archibald)---“tears!---tears upon the face of Arthur Rodman!” “Yes” cried Arthur---“and tears had well nigh been upon your face too, my lad.” Archibald shook his head, and smiled. “O, you may smile---any body can smile---but if you had seen your brother shot through the head, I am inclined to think that—” “What were you firing at?” said my father, leaping over the fence, near where we stood, and standing, all at once, by our side. Arthur, though I attempted to avoid it, immediately told him; and as he did, I could perceive the under lip of Archibald, violently compressed, and his brow knitting with emotion—but my father did not change countenance. “And how did he bear it?” said he—“like a lion!” cried Arthur, striking his hands together—“he only turned upon me, and chided me for my bad shot.” “Not so bad a shot, neither,” said Archibald, putting his hand to my face—“an inch or two more, and the hall would have done your business—you will have to get a lock shorn, on the other side of your head.” It was very true—my hair was loose and flying in the wind, and the ball, diverted from its aim, by the jar of the piece, as it fell into Arthur's hand, had cut away one of the heaviest locks, as if it had been shorn with a razor. My blood thrilled—and I felt sick at the heart, for a moment—and if I had been alone, I should have fainted, I dare say, while I thought of my narrow escape; but eventually, it was a happy thing for me, perhaps, one of the happiest, for it gave others a great opinion of my self-command, and finally, produced a like opinion in myself. Nay, to this very incident, in a great measure, I believe, may be attributed, the reputation, that I subsequently obtained, of being one of the most intrepid fellows in our regiment —for I have always observed, that, when a report has once gone abroad, people rarely think of enquiring into the origin, or authority of it; so that it would be no difficult matter, I believe, for any man to put his own character, in what form he pleases, out into the world; and, after a time, they that were vociferous in defence of his virtues, would forget that he, himself, was the author and origin of all that related to them. “Say that you are not afraid of the devil,” said Arthur, to our sergeant, one day, “and by and by, it will become your general reputation—every body will swear, that you are not afraid of the devil, and forget who told him so—nay, fight to prove it— for such is man's nature; enlist him to report a doubt ful affair, and it is ten to one, that he exaggerates in proportion as he is distrusted, until at last, he is willing to spill his blood in proof of it!—another good effect is, that the man himself, at last, begins to believe that other people know him better than he knows himself---and he really becomes, what they say he is--- not afraid of the devil!” At last, we breakfasted altogether, my dear mother at my right hand,—a mournful, but manly and noble sorrow was in the countenance of my father—a more tender and passionate one, in the light hazle eyes of my mother,—and, in all the rest, that kind of unwillingness to be either silent or talkative, which characterises young hearts, when they are among them that mourn—without being able to understand or comfort them.—We swallowed our milk (for coffee was unknown to us then)—but left the food untasted—and then, with an occasional word or two, that sounded abruptly upon the ear, as if spoken in a wrong place, unpreparedly, as in a sick chamber, or house of prayer—we mounted our horses. “You will beat up for recruits,” said my father, “during the day, and return to us at night—tomorrow we shall try to set you both off in good earnest.” Archibald came to me, and took the bridle in his hand for a moment, as I was turning away—and then let it go again, reluctantly, as if he had intended to bid me a farewell,—but his heart had failed him— “But Archy—how is this?” said my father, “Do you not go with them?” “No Sir”—said Archibald, throwing down his eyes, “my horse might run away with me, you know.” My father laughed—“no, my boy, you are the better horseman of the three—if not the best of the county, and I would trust you to break a colt, that I would not trust many a rider to cross, after you had subdued him.—I did not mean to mortify you—I only desired to make you feel that you were comparatively helpless.” “I did feel it father;” said Archibald—walking away.— “Well, well,—never mind it son. The stud is your own. Take your choice, and follow them, if you will, —or go with me to the muster—or take your own way, and, if you think you can succeed, go among the lads of the neighbourhood, and see how many you can bring in.”— His eyes flashed fire, I remember, as we set off at full gallop, for the high road; and, in less than twenty minutes, we saw him, stretching like a hunter over a distant elevation; after which—for he only took off his hat, stood up in the stirrups, for a moment, and waved it without stopping—after which, we saw no more of him, till about nine that evening, when he came suddenly upon us, with nearly twenty well mounted VOL. I. 4 young fellows, upon the best horses in the country —rattling at his heels, like so many mad devils—they almost rode us down,—for, with all our efforts, we had been able to muster but five. `How he sits!' cried Arthur, pointing to him, as he rode leisurely about, while we were all trying to form.—The moon shone gallantly upon us, and really, had there been a trumpet there, and an enemy, we should have given a good account of him, notwithstanding our inexperience, and wretched equipment.—Indeed, there is a natural feeling of the heart, a proud pulse, about men always, who ride well, and are well mounted, though they are alone, in the daylight;—but when there are thirty more of them, thundering along at full gallop, under a broad blue sky, and a clear star light—though they were day labourers on foot, there would be a swelling of the heart, warlike and hazardous I am sure, like banditti at least, if not like well trained cavalry. “I am thinking,” said Archibald, leaping his horse at full speed, over a ditch, where all the others halted and boggled—and joining us—“I am thinking that, if we ride over to the plain, yonder,—the musterground— —that we may spend an hour or two, profitably, in manœuvring against tomorrow—” Arthur smiled, but, in that spirit of fellowship, which all men have, under excitement, we rode on, renewing our acquaintance with some of the horsemen about us, and making it with such as were strangers—they were fine fellows indeed, and when we were afterward counted off into fours, and sixes, and the order was given to gallop,—I thought that I had never seen so handsome a troop of yeomanry. Archibald had ridden hard, I am sure, that day, for the mettlesome creature that he rode, kept throwing down her head, and snorting continually, when she stopped, as if hurt in her wind. “My friends,” said Archibald—the moon shone full upon his white forehead, as he uncovered it, and wiped away the sweat,—“it is now time to separate. Let us meet tomorrow, at twelve on this spot, each prepared, to return no more—or to return victorious—I said us —I do not mean it. It is not in my power to be with you, except perhaps, as I have already told you, to bid you God speed. But before we part, if you are willing to spend half an hour, and your horses are not fatigued, I will show you what little I know of the cavalry exercise; so that you will be enabled, at least, to enter the camp, with an air of respectability.” The proposition was agreed to, and he threw us into line; counted us off into sections; wheeled in and out, gallopped, and charged. I was truly astonished at the result. Before we parted, our horses would rein as steadily into line, and wheel, with as much precision, almost of themselves, as if they took a pride in it— and subsequent experience has proved to me that they do; for many a wild one have I seen broken to the line, in a single drilling. We then separated, all to our different homes, for the night;—When Arthur, who had been riding at our side, in silence, for about half an hour, suddenly wheeled from the road, with a laugh, leaped a low stone wall, and dashed away to our left— “At twelve precisely,” said I calling after him— —“aye! aye.—At twelve!”—he answered, flourishing his sword in the star light. Archibald reined up for a moment, and looked after him, in surprise—“not the way to his uncles?”— said he— “No,” I replied, well knowing where he had gone. —“I believe not”— Archibald looked at me for a moment, as if about to speak—but he did not, and then put a head for some time.— “What say you,” said he, abruptly—“shall we ride over to Arnauld's.”— “By all means,” I cried, leaping forward and abreast of him, it is only a mile or two—and I should like to see Lucia, before I go.”— “Lucia!—Yes,” said Archibald, stooping over the neck of his horse and feeling the curb—“it would be well, you are a favorite there brother; and it would be rather unfriendly to go away for so long a — brother your stirrups are too long—shorten them—you can never sit firmly in that way—throw your feet home.” “Pho, pho—how should you know better than I.” “I do know better than you, brother; and it matters not how I know it—if you do not ride with short stirrups, and your feet home, you are perpetually in danger of losing your seat, and your stirrup.” “But suppose I should be thrown?”— “You cannot be thrown. You must not look to such an event as possible. I was never thrown.”— “I beg your pardon.”—said I— “Never!” he replied, warmly,—“once or twice the horse fell with me.”— “And suppose that your feet had been home then, what would have become of you?”— “They were. I grant brother, if you are thrown, that it is more dangerous; but then you are not the hundreth part so likely to be thrown as—ah! musick!”— We were now passing the windows; a long row of which, with the curtains up, were all illuminated. Archibald put his hand gently upon mine, for a minute, and sat listening. “By heaven!” said I—“there never was such a voice upon earth.”— But he said nothing—he only drew a long breath, and turned aside his face— There was Lucia, lolling upon the sofa, and singing away, with all her heart and soul, as if her very breath were melody—so sweet and natural was the modulation of the tone. “How very beautiful!” said I—dazzled by her brightness, as the fire light shone upon her eloquent countenance, and gave to the whole of it, the hue of, like a lighted transparency. Archibald made no reply, but threw himself from the saddle, and struck the gate with his whip handle. The sound immediately ceased, and some tokens of alarm were given, for hands were busy in letting down the curtains of the room, all round; and it was some minutes before we were admitted—but then—O! our welcome, was that of the heart. “Oh, my dear, dear friend,” cried Lucia, running to Archibald, and putting her hands into his—“how glad I am that you are here.” “Why so?”—said he, colouring a little. “O”—she answered—“O”—her pleasant, dark, hazle eyes, with lashes, black as death, were shaded, for a moment, with embarrassment—“we have been terrified, this afternoon, with some stories about a troop of horse, in the neighbourhood.” “But you seem to have forgotten Mr. Oadley,” said her elder sister Clara, a remarkably pale, tall girl, with a serious cast of countenance, with very bright eyes, incessantly in motion. Lucia, coloured to the temples, and stepping forward, her superb person just losing its girlishness, for the graver beauty of womanhood—“I pray Mr. Oadley, to pardon me,” she said; “I have always been more intimate with his brother, as he knows well, and when I see him, there are so many feelings of the old school-fellow, at my heart, that I am half inclined to forget both our ages in a game of romps!” Her sister smiled, a little scornfully, I thought; and her mother, one of the most truly beautiful women of the age, immediately set all matters right, by shaking her finger at Lucia—and welcoming, with her accustomed gracefulness and ease—her “caro amico!” “I am really glad that you have come—separate from the pleasure that your company always gives to us, on account of this report, and the absence of my husband.” “Absent?” said I—but before I could say more, a look from Archibald cut me short. There was a momentary embarrassment in all our faces—for I dreaded to mention, that I had seen him within an hour or two; and still less, would I have told her, where—for there was something, rather mysterious—and, VOL. I. 4* as my father thought, dangerous in the movements, and authority of Mr. Arnauld—but it soon wore off, and we joined, pleasantly, in conversation. “I heard your voice, I believe,” said Archibald, looking at Lucia, “as we approached.” “Mine!”—she answered, with surprise—“a— laughing, I suppose?” “No—singing—your favourite air.” “O, no—that was Clara's.” Archibald and I exchanged a look with each other, and smiled. Here had been one of those delusions, at which men may laugh, if they will, but which are strangely mortifying to them, after all. We had united, heretofore, in our condemnation of Clara's voice, chiefly, I dare say, because we had not often heard it, and when we had, only by stealth or accident; yet, to night, in the depth of our feeling, we had mistaken it for that of her sister, which was, undeniably, the richest, sweetest, and most passionate of all the country—we!—no, how do I know that he was deceived? “One song,” said my brother, “Miss Lucia, and we will then leave you.” “A strong temptation!” she said, softly, to me, looking through her abundant, dark hair—“shall I?” “O, certainly!” I answered, “I have come on purpose to hear one more of—” “Why, what is all this?” said her mother, glancing at Archibald—“your countenance, is more than commonly serious. Has any thing happened?” “My brother,” said Archibald, “will join the army, to-morrow.” “The army!—gracious heaven!”—said Clara, and then checked herself, while the blood darkened her whole forehead. “And your brother”—said a faint voice to me—I looked up, and saw the face of Lucia, near mine, exceedingly pale—and her white hand, raised—“will he go with you?” I shook my head, and her hand fell—the next moment, I saw her sitting back, as far as she could, with her eyes upon a book; but occasionally, they turned timidly aside, to the face of my brother, who sat, in his usual mood, studying the fire, with his under lip working, and shadows flitting, now and then, over his intensely white forehead, as if the thoughts of his heart took wing, one after the other. His revery was profound, and undisturbed, till the clock struck, and he started upon his feet—and began buttoning up his coat, to depart. “You will not leave us to-night?” said the mother. Clara, walked up to me, as pallid as ever—and the book fell from Lucia's hand. “Madam,” answered my brother, “if you have any apprehension remaining, we certainly shall not— one of us (Lucia, moved near to him, and Clara, to me, as he continued) one of us will remain.” She shook her head. “Well then, both of us will remain,” said Archibald, drawing up his chair to the corner, and entering into conversation, as if his thought were any where in this world, but in that room. “But why do not you join the army?” said Mrs. Arnauld to him. Archibald turned slowly round, and smiled rather bitterly, I thought; and Lucia sat more erect, for awhile—and then leaned forward, as if to catch every word, and tone, and look. “For two or three reasons,” said Archibald, firmly —“In the first place, I am not twenty-one—not my own man—in the next place, I am to be a parson— a parson!—and, finally, I am so weakly a creature, that I might be run away with, by my horse—or trampled to death, by the foot—excellent reasons, Madam; are they not?” I could perceive, that Mrs. Arnauld looked astonished, and Lucia terrified; and I---I confess, that I should have been equally so, had I not seen the late developement of his character, before my father; for his irony was a naked blade---it went to the heart. Here Lucia's hair fell---and she consumed ten minutes, at least, in adjusting it, all the time keeping her beautiful eyes turned in the direction where he sat, with his fingers playing, involuntarily, upon the next chair, without moving a limb, or uttering a sound. On the whole, it was a melancholy evening; such as I should not desire to pass again, under any circumstances. It was saddening to my heart; oppressive to my spirits; and, when I thought of the possibility; nay, of the probability, that we might never all meet again, in the same room, it was with difficulty that I could refrain from expressing a sorrow, and apprehension, that would have been unmanly. At last we parted---“Farewell, Madam,” said I —“I shall not see you in the morning.” “Heaven bless you!” she replied, cordially pressing my hand. “May God be with you, in battle and in sleep—night and day—bien bon soir.” “Amen!” said some one faintly, at my side;—it was Clara—I turned to offer her my hand, but some unaccountable timidity—took sudden possession of me, and I could not—I gave it to Lucia—who burst into tears. I was astonished—what was there to affect her so deeply, more than her sister? why at all?—might it not be that her heart was full before, to running over, and that she was glad of any pretence to discharge the fountain of tears.— “Farewell,” said I again—“farewell!”— Clara put her hand upon my arm—as I passed her— but instantly withdrew it, and when I looked, she had turned away her face, so that I could not tell if it were designedly done or not:—but I lay awake, I know, many a long hour, sleepy as I was, that night, endeavouring to reconcile such an accident, with her habitual reserve, and lofty, severe rectitude of deportment.—It could not be—no—Clara Arnauld was not a woman to feel at the heart—and least of all—for such a man as I—uninformed—inexperienced and— We were in our saddles by early day light, the next morning, and trotted slowly, past the windows of the chamber, where we knew that the young ladies slept— a white hand stirred the curtain—nothing more—I could have sworn that it was Clara's—but on looking into Archibald's eyes—I was sure that he thought it Lucia's. Alas! it was the hand of neither—it was that of a man—a man!—what!—said I, half audibly, in the bed chamber of—the next moment, I saw that it was Mr. Arnauld himself, evidently wishing to see us, without being seen himself, for he hastily disappeared, and the next minute, the curtain of another window fell, suddenly, as if some one had just left it—after all then, my heart was right—it was she!--- “What a charming creature she is!” said I, half unwilling to interrupt the solemn stillness of our ride. “Yes,” said my brother---“full blooded”---but reining his beautiful mare about, so as to see her blood red nostrils, through which her breath issued, like a bright vapour, for a whole yard, upon the cold air—“but she was sadly put to it yesterday, and I feared for her wind—not blown I hope, but— “O, I understand you, now,” I replied, completely puzzled for a moment, “you are always thinking of your mare.” “Aye brother!—what else have I to think of? she knows me—see!” As he spoke, he loosened the rein for a moment:— the fire flashed from her wild eyes, and she shot by me like an arrow. The road was a very dangerous one, encumbered with trees and rocks, roots, stumps, and broken all up, with the feet of heavy cattle; so that I held my breath for a moment, till I saw him rein her short, as if upon a pivot, without stopping. “By heaven, Archibald, how did you teach her that?”---said I, coming up with him. He laughed, but there was a mournfulness in the sound; as there was, even in the warm flush upon his pallid front, and the arrowy brightness of his intensely blue eyes---they were not the symptoms of health or happiness. “I'll tell you brother---I was reading some time since about the Arabian horses; and, when we get to a better place, I will shew you that there is no such mighty matter, in stopping at full speed, or mounting and dismounting, at a gallop.—But what were you speaking of---brother?” “Of the most charming creature in the world,” said I, feeling every word that I uttered--- “Yes, yes, brother”---responded Archibald---stooping on the off side of his mare, and turning the stirrup, for his foot; “yes---but I cannot well bear to talk of her now”--- But, I replied, unwilling to let the conversation die away so soon---we were just approaching the highest ground in the neighbourhood, from which we could have a view of twenty miles all about us---“I do not like her coquetry.” “What!”---said Archibald, abruptly---“no,” I continued---“nor that womanish pedantry and affectation.”— “Affectation!”---said he, rivetting his eyes upon me, in astonishment---“what the devil do you mean? John?” “O---I do not hope to convince you of it, such a favourite as you are”---(He coloured to the eyes)---and that vile habit of sprinkling all she says, with poetry, and French and Italian---a smattering of”--- “I'll tell you what, brother,” said he, riding up to me---“I can't put up with this. I told you once before, that I did not like to talk upon the subject---and I tell you once more---and once, for all---that I won't put up with it---” I was amazed---we stopped our horses, and faced each other, for a moment, upon the very summit of the elevation---“are you mad?” said I---“one would think that you were in love with her---(the fire streamed from his eyes)---take care what you are about-- that husband is not the gentlest of men, or the most forgiving;---nor will he be the more likely to treat you gently for your passionate adoration of his wife, because he is the greatest profligate of the country.”--- “Husband! wife!”---said Archibald---impatiently, and stooping from the saddle---“what are you talking about?”--- “Of Mrs. Arnauld,” I replied. He drew a long breath, and reached me his hand, with a smile that went to my heart---“I am a little absent, I believe,”---said he---“you know that I am apt to be thoughtful, and just now”---(he appeared to forget himself, for a moment, in another revery---but started again, at the sound of two or three shot, that appeared to be fired in the valley below:---when the mare plunged suddenly, and had well nigh dislodged him on the spot. “She had well nigh broken your neck then, brother,” said I—looking about for the sportsmen, who, I supposed, were out after game; but I could see nothing; not even the smoke of their pieces—yet they sounded very near to us. “I deserved it,” said he, reining her up firmly, and adjusting himself to the seat—“tame as she is, I ought never to forget what she has been—a horseman will always mind saddle, rein and stirrup, (no matter what he is upon) as if he expected to be run away with, every moment—Ha!—another, that!—the game must be well up this morning.” “That was a pistol shot” said I—“O yes, I dare say it was,” he answered;—“our troop are amusing themselves at a mark. But you were speaking of her affectation;—I am sorry for it on some accounts; she is so truly charming in every other respect—and then, it cannot have escaped you, that our good mother is a little sore of late in her rivalship, for I have caught her more than once, throwing in, with a laughable unluckyness, some of the wretched French that she has picked up at Madam Arnauld's.” “You are severe upon Mrs. Arnauld,” said I—“too severe; I only complain that she will not consent to talk her mother tongue—not that her French and Italian are wretched.” “But they are,” said my brother. “Oh! no; she has been familiar with them both— and—” “Pho!—Not a word of either did she ever pronounce properly in her life.” “But how do you know?” He coloured again—I never saw any body blush so readily as he could, about that time. Every emotion of his heart sent the blood all over his face, as if he had been a bashful young girl, on horseback, in male attire.—“Not of my own knowledge, to be sure,” said he—but I have seen Lucia hold down her face, a hundred times, when her mother threw in a word or two of some other language —and though I know nothing of either, yet I am persuaded that all the mother knows of French or Italian, has been gathered from the daughters. Beside, how different their manner and pronunciation—they never introduce a word of either language, unnecessarily; and you might live with them for a whole year, without suspecting that they knew a word of any but their own, were they not led into it by some stratagem of their mother, when strangers from the city are there —or by the accomplished elegance of their father— the profligate!—or by actual necessity: and their pronunciation too, is so firm and neat, as if they were not conscious of speaking in any but their mother tongue.—Beside, I have not forgotten the look of approbation that—that—Miss Lucia bestowed on me once, when I said that he who had any thought, could always express it; that the use of foreign phrases was a proof of poverty, rather than opulence; of ignorance rather than superiority:” “Her mother was not there, I hope,” said I— “O, no—gracious God! brother, what is that?—is not that our house?” I turned in the direction where he pointed—and beheld a black smoke rising, as from the ruins of some farm house, given to massacre and pillage by the damnable Hessians. “No, brother, that is not our house—but—let us ride on—who knows what may have happened?” We started at full speed, and were just on the top of a second hill, where we could see a clear road before us—when we heard shot after shot fired, behind us—and the next moment, a horseman dashed headlong over the side of a distant hill, pursued at their topmost speed, by at least a dozen men in the royal uniform.—“Follow me, brother!” cried Archibald, striking the rowels into his mare, and galloping directly to the spot— “Madman!” I shouted—“come back! rein up, rein up!—where are your arms?”— He heeded me not, his hat flew off, and it was in vain for me ever to think of overtaking him. What could I do?—there were noises and shouting all about me, it appeared—and I could see, every now and then, somebody dashing out of the far wood, or down a hill,— as if the whole country were in alarm— Yet I prest on, at the top of my speed, to the brow of the hill—just in season, to see the horseman that was ahead, wheel short upon his first pursuer—and exchange a shot with him, when, it appeared to me, that their pistols almost touched: the latter kept on, sitting bolt upright—and the former drew out his sword and came immediately upon St. George, without looking behind him—and then—finding that he was not pursued-gave a cut in the rear, and wheeled—and looked at his enemy—who passed on a hundred yards, at least—after receiving the shot, and then fell, dead, from the saddle. Down came his comrades then, with a loud outcry VOL. I. 5 upon the conqueror; but, with a presence of mind that dismayed me, he wheeled upon them, a full dozen as they were, and leaped a broad ditch, exchanging cut after cut, as he passed, and giving point, with a precision that I never saw equalled at the ring; it was then that I saw his object---two only of the squadron could follow him---and there was Archibald, on the other side, shouting with all his might, as if succour were at hand---“come on, boys! come on!”---The troopers reined up, and loaded their pistols---and I, desperate with apprehension, rode round to join my brother, designing to pass by the dead man and make prize of his sword---and his pistols too, if possible, for about a hundred yards from where he lay, his horse had tumbled, and was yet struggling in his furniture: but I had not gone half way to the place---though the flanks of my poor horse ran down with blood, and I thought that I never should get to it---when there was another shout, a clashing of swords, and a rapid discharge of pistols—and the same moment, Archibald's mare darted by me—the bridle broken, and stirrups ringing—O!—I never shall forget that pang— `poor Archibald!' I cried, and the next moment, I heard the trampling of hoofs at my side. It was Arthur!—pale as death—bloody—and covered with sweat— `Your father!!' said he—`your father!'— `What of him!' I cried, blinded and thunderstruck, with a new fear.— `Ride, for life and death, ride!'—he answered, in a voice so changed that I scarcely knew it,—but I could not obey him.—I could not—I threw myself from the saddle—plucked the sword from the dead hand of the horseman—and rode to the spot where I had seen Archibald last. He was safe—thank heaven, he was safe—his forehead was cut a little—and the blood was running down his naked arms—this is all that I remember—for a bugle sounded, in our rear—the fellows halted in chase, one after the other, like a line of videttes—and seeing horsemen mustering in all directions, obeyed the call, and abandoned the chase. `There!' said I—throwing a sword to Archibald, as he stood over the stranger, wrapping up his wounds, with the shirt that he had torn off from his own body— `there!—follow, to the farm! follow for life and death!' I then set off, with a feeling of horrour and darkness, that I cannot pretend to describe. I set off for my father's—I arrived. It was a ruin! I fell from the saddle. The place that I had left, but the morning before—the house—the house—it was one pile of ashes and fire.—Nothing but the chimney, and one of the roughcast ends were left standing—the very barns and out houses were a heap of smoking cinders—the hay and grain, at every blast of wind, sending up a rush of sparkles, with a sudden blaze, like powder. I was bewildered for some moments—unable to feel or to understand the nature of the calamity that had befallen us—till, on looking about, I saw the skeleton, of two or three half consumed bodies in the fire. I know not what gave me the strength for such a desperate attempt, but I leaped into the burning ashes, up to my knees, and dragged out—merciful powers!—what I feared were the last remains of my own father and mother—but no—that horrour was spared to me—they were Hessians—they were covered with leather—and I fell down upon my knees and thanked heaven for it! but still I persisted in the search, till my boots and clothes were literally burnt from me, and I was choked and blinded by the loathsome smoke of the bodies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. IV. “Aye! down to the dust with them! slaves as they are!” My father was alive—thank heaven! my father was alive!—my poor mother too—O, my children, would that you could understand me, without the use of language—! `This comes,' said my father, sternly, to Archibald, who stood before him, holding Arthur by the hand— `of your disobedience. Had you returned last night— as you promised—' `How many were they?' said Archibald—`twenty when they broke in'—said my father—baring his brawny arm to the shoulder—it was gashed to the bone in a dozen or more places—`twenty!—but they left us with less than half able to sit their horses—two more of you—and we would have made mince-meat of the rascals—d—n them.—' I looked at him, awestruck at the preternatural expression of his wrath—and wondered at the melancholy, dreadful aspect of my mother— `Mary—Mary—said Archibald—gasping for breath; did she come—was she there—ah!' My father put him aside—my mother shook from head to foot, and Arthur dropped Archibald's hand, and stood—Oh! how altered, since the las night— immoveable as a dead man. Archibald was the first to speak—`she is dead then, I—I hope,' said he. `Aye—dead—dead, in her innocence—blessed one!' said my father, as if his heart were breaking. `Then thank God! thank God!' said Archibald—while Arthur locked his hands, and lifted them, devoutly, to the skies; and my mother, as if touched by some horrid thought all at once—threw herself into my father's arms, and buried her face in his bosom—he repulsed her, and shuddered—and then, as if wondering at himself, embraced her, for a whole minute, in silence—and then led her away—while she covered her face with her hands—and moved like a woman, that God hath more than widowed—her very attitude was that of desperation and horrour.— Archibald took out his watch, with a calmness that awed me—bent the sword upon which he leant, so that the hilt almost touched the floor---exchanged a look, the import of which I did not suspect, till his absence had began to alarm us---with Arthur---and stepped out of the room. We were at Mr. Arnauld's---I had forgotten to tell you how it was brought about---but there it was---and there was the wounded officer too---the handsomest fellow that I ever saw in my life---lying in the same apartment. `My excellent neighbour,' said Mr. Arnauld, entering, booted and spurred---followed by his beautiful wife,--- `there is my hand---this outrage is not to be borne--- henceforward, I am an American---heart, blood and pulse---there is the royal protection! (tearing a paper in pieces, and throwing it into the fire, indignantly, as he spoke)---there let it be!---no peace with the tyrants--- no quarter! I have been a friend of the royal cause--- a friend of Sir Henry Clinton---and that paper, signed by himself, and Sir William Howe---whose gallant brother died in my arms, when I was a fellow soldier with him, years and years ago---that paper contained the royal word, the plighted honour of these scoundrel commissioners, that, not only my household should be spared from pillage, but yours---nay, do not frown, my friend---I knew your sturdy and inflexible nature too well, to attempt compounding with it---I hope that you will forgive me---your name does not appear— but no matter—there lies the protection, it was a trap, VOL. I. 5* a mere trap to lull us into security—the Hessians cannot read it---and henceforward'—locking his hands, `I will depend upon no other but that of God, and my own right arm--I---' (his eye fell upon Arthur, whom he had not seen before.) He faltered—and I was not a little startled at the manner of Arthur, who stood, looking at him awhile, with his arms folded, lips compressed, and an appalling fixedness of eye; and then left the room. Mr. Arnauld, took the hand of his wife—`Louisa,' said he, `make my peace with that young man'—he has saved the life of your husband—I will not say how —but his life, and something, dearer to him than his life, Arthur Rodman, spared to him—saved to him.' `How, Robert?' said Mrs. Arnauld. `I cannot well bear to relate it,' said her husband— `but you know my temper—I—enough, for the present, that he saved me from a crime—the young and innocent, from death—and, when deeply, unalterably wronged, and I was helpless at his feet, shook me from him, to the dust.' His wife, understood him, but too well; and her eyes ran over, as she turned away her face. `Arnauld!' said my father, in a terrible voice, `are you the man?' `I am'—was the reply, as he stood fearlessly before him. `God forgive you!' said my father, `poor Mary!' `Mary!' said Mrs. Arnauld, glancing at her husband—`not Mary Austin?—what mean you?'—`Oadley,' said Arnauld, going up to him, with a look of deep terrour, `I dread to hear your reply—you are not a man to be lightly disturbed—what has happened to the poor innocent?' There was a silence of half a minute; during which, we all stood, looking at each other. `She is dead,' said my father. `Dead!—God forbid—how!—how in Heaven's name?—tell me—tell me, Oadley!' `She had discovered, before you saw her, last night, that you were a married man—she had determined to meet you once more; upbraid you for your perfidy, and throw herself at the feet of Arthur Rodman—poor Arthur. That led to the encounter between you— that brought her to my house, last night—that—' Arnauld staggered away from us, as my father continued, and his wife sunk into a chair, and buried her face in her hands. `Last night, Sir—she—she was destroyed.' `May they be accursed, forever and ever! may the hottest lightnings of Heaven—the—' `Rash man!'—cried my father, sternly, `how dare you kneel down, before your own wife, and call the lightnings of God upon men---soldiers---untrained and undisciplined ruffians, who would but have done, what you meditated---you, Arnauld---a father and a husband---you! who should have been the first, having daughters of your own, to spill your blood, for the protection of sorrow, and innocence, and helplessness ---you!---the destruction of the loveliest creature, that was ever infatuated with a villain.' Arnauld, arose; and but for me, would have struck my father. `That, in my own house!' cried he, black in the face with passion, and frothing at the mouth. `Aye! in your own house, or any where---strike me if you will!---broken hearted, as I am---my habitation given to the flames---my wife---(I thought that he would never finish the sentence)—my own wife, the mother of my boys---the only companion of my heart and soul, Arnauld---for I have been faithful to her, and she to me; and we were hoping to have gone down to our graves, at last, in our old age, untouched by shame or dishonour—I—I— Aye! any where —turn us, if you will, naked and homeless, upon the cold world—shut your door against us, and see us perish, as the wild beast should not perish, if her young were with her—and still. I will repeat to you, that—let it ring in your ears, at the day of judgment; that Mary Austin died!—and, blessed be God, that she did die!—more innocent, even in the locked arms of a storming madman, than—' `Tell me—tell me!—you know what I would say, Oadley—tell me but that—that, Oadley, and I will lay down my life at your bidding—forgive you—and—' The tears gushed out of his eyes, and he sobbed like a child, and stood with locked hand, waiting the reply. `Yes, Arnauld,' said my father, I do understand you—there is a feeling of humanity about you, yet. Repent and be forgiven!—repent, and there is my hand: Forever and ever, will I stand by you, and your's—Mary Austin, died unprofaned.' Arnauld fell upon his knees, buried his face in the lap of his wife; shook all over, as with an ague; pressed her hands, again and again, to his forehead, and lips, and eyes, while her tears fell like rain upon his face, through her dishevelled hair. O, it was a sight for angels to dwell upon, with beating hearts, and trembling lips. There was not a dry eye, among us—the wounded stranger, himself, who seemed hardly enough alive, to lift his noble face from the pillow, lay there, with his eyes shut, and the tears trickling, slowly, through their lashes. `Let this never be mentioned,' said my father, in a milder tone, turning to me; with a look of such solemnity, that I felt it as a dying injunction. Our attention was called off, by a distant shouting; and soon after, a troop of horsemen came by the window, in full gallop. Some of them, I recognized, immediately, for the men that were to assemble at twelve ---It was near two, I found, and then, for the first time, the cause of my brother's disappearance flashed into my mind. My blood curdled—I knew his rash spirit, and ran out to meet them. All my fears were realized—he had met them—led them in person, after the marauders, and, finally succeeded, in capturing a party of the very rascals, that had burnt down our house, the night before. My father knew them immediately, and after embracing Archibald, who was so weak, from one or two flesh wounds, and his natural delicacy, that he could hardly sit on his horse, began to move his arms, as if he were about to take a terrible vengeance upon some one. `Are here all?—all?' said he impatiently; the blood gushing from his nostrils. `All that we met,' said one of the party, `except the tallest, and one or two others, that we left upon the ground.' `And the scoundrel that Archibald shot, said a second, because he happened to have a handkerchief about his neck, that he thought was his mother's.' `Had he a red collar?' said my father, catching him by both arms—a red collar?—red?---red as blood? ---hey?' `Yes, Sir,' was the reply, `Archibald's got the handkerchief now.' Archibald pulled it out of his bosom—it was wet through and through, soaking in crimson—he turned away, sick as death from it; it dropped from his fingers—and he shuddered. `That handkerchief! yes—yes, my brave boy—yes! that was thy mother's—God bless thee for it!—God forever bless thee!—thou little knowest what thou hast done. Was it you—Archibald—was it you! did you shoot him dead—dead, Archibald?” My brother shook his head—looked at his red fingers—and staggered to the wall. `O thou!' cried my father, locking his old hands, `thou the avenger of blood!--thou the judge of all the earth..... blessed be thy name, that the son hath been permitted to deal out thy retribution upon the man that—O, my child!—my child! ask of me what thou wilt!—lo, I am ready to do thy bidding.” Archibald arose—fell upon his neck—and uttered some low sounds. `Yes my boy—my brave boy!—whenever you please---and I will go with you—lead you, with my own hands, into the presence of Washington—buckle a sword upon my own thigh, and stand by you, as your soldier and follower, to the last drop of my blood!' Archibald could support it no longer---he fainted away upon the spot. `But where is Arthur!—look to him, John---the must not be left alone'---said my father. `Hearty as a buck,' said one of the horsemen---`dang it! how he cut and slashed among 'em.' `Did'nt he strike home?' cried a second catching his hand. `Home!' cried a stout yankee, who had just come among us---`home? yes! that he did! the first blow set that fellow's skull-cap a spinning, like a pewter plate-- and the next, brought him from his horse.' `Fleshed to the hilt!' cried another, of a younger, and better educated class. Would there had been more of them!' `But is he safe?' said my father---`Not a hair of his head is hurt,' said the speaker---`he and Archy were the first that came up with the chaps, taking their fire, foolishly enough, as he said, himself, afterward, all along, from right to left, as they passed:---and they were clattering away, at a devil of a rate, before we could get up---your d---d blood horses, farmer Oadley, are too many guns for us.' `In attack?' said his companion---chucking him under the ribs---`well enough in retreat, hey?' `Bob'---said one of the others---`did you see them get a single blow at Rodman;' `No---d-n'd a one dared to strike at him, after they saw his face!' `No wonder they were frightened!'—said the other —`my bits chattered, when he passed us, at the heels of that devilish mare of Oadley's;—he looked like a dead man, broke loose in day light---and breaking his neck to get back again.' `He was in a fair way to get back again, dead or alive, when I saw him last,' said the little fellow—`but let us look him up.' `Aye, do my brave lads,' said my father, `do, and by tomorrow's sun I will be with you, and we'll raise a regiment of such fellows, and see if that won't fix 'em.' The motion of a hand, from the bed where lay the wounded man, turned our attention. I went to him,—he was very faint—`let them do nothing rashly,' said he---`wait a few days—we shall know by that time whether I am to live or die. If I live, I'll carry you in myself—in style my lads—in style!— if not—why—ah, that was an ugly cut, faith—I'll tell you how to do it, for yourself—Don't go yet—Washington won't hear a word of you—he is tired and sick of your volunteering—your rabble gentry—coming and going when they please—there's the damned Connecticut light horsemen--they have just gone home, in a body—the scampering rascals!—because he put them on duty at night—pretty fellows!—I may thank them, and their lubberly Colonel—whew!—for this cursed job—I went to pick up my videttes—and—damn it, one half of 'em were your sabbath-day troopers from Connecticut— gentlemen! gentlemen! every one of them. Got tired, and went home—they be damned!' I could hardly keep from laughing, at the drollery of his eyes, and tone—the strange mixture of levity and seriousness about this stranger—he was certainly the handsomest man that I ever saw—tall—well made— square shouldered—full chest—and trod, after he was well enough to walk, with such an air of authority, that I felt like a boy in his presence. But while I was listening to him—my father gave me a sign, and left the room. I followed him, and he led the way to a vacant lot, in the rear of the house. His manner was solemn, beyond all that I had ever seen. `Hearken to me!' said he,--`do not interrupt me, my son. I have determined to go into the army. This night's work was a judgment upon me. I shall return no more to my home—it is dishonoured. I shall build no other—none!—I could not well bear to sit round the hearth of another. I shall leave your mother here —she is prepared for it all. Go in, and comfort her— the poor widowed creature—the broken hearted, desolate woman! Before I sleep, I shall buckle a sword upon my thigh—one that has been fleshed already, to the hilt—to the hilt, Jonathan—And never will I let go of it, till my heart is shattered—my Country free—my wife avenged. That done, it matters little what may become of me--I can come to her then—the aged mourner--and lay my gray head down in her lap —and die.' `Father!' said I, catching at his hand, `speak to me —what has happened?' `Silence,' said he, `silence!—forget it—harmless yourself, for the sacrifice. Ask no questions. Go and comfort your mother.' `But, Mary—may I ask what became of her?' `She is dead,' he replied. `I know that, father—but how?' `How!—would you—unnatural boy—would you— (he appeared to be choking)—I—I—' `But what time did they come, father; and how came Arthur there?' `Sit down, and listen to me.' There was a large tree, uptorn, near us, and I obeyed—the roots were before us, shooting about, and loaded with such a quantity of soil, that nothing less than an earthquake, one would have thought, had been able to disturb it. I observed, that my father's eyes were fixed upon it, and as he sat down, his lips moved. `Even so!' said he, inwardly—`even so—even so! —uptorn and prostrate in its old age!—it's head in the dust... struck with barrenness... even so! —the whirlwind, and the fire—they will have way; and the sword too!—that shall have way!—the widowed one, and the orphan—the broken hearted, and the dying—the avenger of blood, hath his hand upon the hilt—wo to them!—wo to them!—the grey hair of the dishonoured matron—the tears of the mother—the wailing, and shriek of the virgin—they are in the wind—in the wind!—O, Lord God of Israel!—the prayer of an afflicted people—Lo! the old men are taking the field, and the aged, and abused women are buckling their harness, with lamentation and shame, upon their old fathers, and husbands!' His voice died away, thrilling my blood like an imprecation. I could see it working along in the wind, like a cloud of pestilence. I was awestruck—the tremendous repose of his countenance—the slow heaving of his broad chest—and the idea of a man, already approaching the age of sixty, about to abandon every thing on earth, even to his wife,—and go out against the enemies of America—all united to solemnize and confound my feelings.— A silence of some minutes followed, after which, he proceeded to relate what had happened, charging me at the same time, with a look that I shall never forget, not to speak of the subject to my mother, nor to any body else, not even to Arthur. `About ten last night, or perhaps eleven, for we had not been in bed long, I heared Arthur's voice at the door and arose to let him in—there was a large fire burning in the room, and I observed that he was so agitated, that he could hardly speak. As he passed me, he put something behind the door,—I went to see what it was, while he continued walking, to and fro, in the room, like a distracted man—`it was a sword.' `Ah,' said I, recollecting his errand—`how did you succeed? How many recruits?' He did not appear to understand me. I repeated the question, but he seemed to have forgotten all that had passed. `Who came home with you?' said I. He stopped short—passed his hand over his forehead—`I do not know, uncle,' said he, `upon my word, what you have been saying—pray repeat it.' `I heard your voice, long before you knocked,' said I—`in earnest conversation with somebody.' He coloured.— `At first, I thought that people were whispering near me—there were two voices, certainly—and then your aunt, who had been listening too, observed that it was VOL. I. 6 the voice of people at a distance—coming up the wood, `Soon after this you knocked. You look disturbed.' `I am,' said he. `There is danger abroad. I came to apprise you of it. I saw two or three horsemen in the wood, about an hour since, with one stationed at a distance, as if waiting for a reinforcement.'— `Some foraging party, I suppose'— `No, I should think not—they are not well enough covered for that--Ha!' We saw a bright flame arise then, all of a sudden, in the direction of Mr. Ulster's—and the sparks rushed up, into the very sky it seemed, like a whirlwind of fire. `Let us bar the windows, and door,' said Arthur— `and be prepared for the worst,—it is the Hessians.' `Yes,' I replied,--`and the boys, will be at hand soon —I expect them every moment.' He shook his head--`we cannot depend upon them,' said he. `They have business elsewhere.' We went about securing, as well as we could, the windows and doors--and preparing our two men servants--placing the women in the cellar—my wife, Mary, and the three girls--and then sat down, to await the result. `What is the matter with Mary!' said I, `I thought her a girl of more heart. How pale she is! she is safer here than at home--and yet, I should be sorry to have any ill befall her, under my roof. How is this, Rodman?--you are strangely affected,' said I, seeing him turn away his face--`look at me. What has happened to you?' `By heaven,' he answered, `I can bear it no longer —dear, dear Mary!—uncle, you know, how long I have loved her—how truly—and, how her affectionate heart used to doat upon me—and—' `Used to, Arthur—there is no change, I hope.' `No change!' said he, `when Mary Austin goes out of her bed, at night, to meet a man, in a lone wood —away from mortal help—a married man!'— I caught him by the arm—`Arthur Rodman—are you mad?' said I,—`who has put this notion into your head? It is a wretched, pitiful falsehood.' `I saw it, uncle—I saw it—thank God, in time—I heard her voice—I knew it—for I was riding ten miles out of my way, just to hear Mary Austin's voice, once more, before I went into battle; though, it were only to say, as she used to, `heaven bless you, Arthur!— good night, Arthur!' I was in high spirits—my blood, bounded through my arteries—I had just left a troop of young fellows; stout of heart, and true of hand; and was happy—O, how happy! I heard a shriek—loud— piercingly loud—it was a shriek, that could not be mistaken. I happened to be armed, and I galloped in a direct line, through the wood—by heaven, I thought that I never should get to it, in this world; but, at last, I did. There she was, yet struggling with the villain, and, nearly overcome. I struck him to the earth, and she fainted; but just as I was about driving my sword through his accursed body—she—O that women will forgive such things—things that shame men to think of—she threw herself before me, clasped my knees, and stayed the uplifted weapon.' `I knew not what lulled me—whether it was the broad moonlight; her utter helplessness; her abashed eyes; and pale, speechless lips, or what; but, the sword dropped from my hand, and the villain walked off.' `She still clung to me, not, I am sure, in tenderness to me, but lest I should pursue him.' `Who was he?' said I, to Arthur. `I shall never utter his name, uncle,' said he; `I have promised that, and, the secret shall die with me.' `But, how came you here?' said I, to Mary. She hid her face, and burst into tears. `Because,' said she, at length—`but O, let us leave this place— Arthur---let us go away—home, home—if you will not abandon me!' I was unable to reply—and she told me, what must have been true, that she had met him, with the most innocent intention—that she had no idea of the distance, to which he had beguiled her, or the lateness of the hour—that she had consented to this, as a farewell meeting—that she loved him—but, that she had found he was a married man; and, she could not bear to break his heart, as he had told her a thousand times, it would, if she left him, till she had reasoned awhile, with him. In short, uncle—the poor creature, in the simplicity, and purity, and nakedness of her own heart, had thrown herself, entirely into his power; and, nothing saved her, but my happening to hear that she would visit you to day; and, by coming at the hour that I did---for—' `Here there was a sound, as if a body of horsemen were silently, surrounding the house,' said my father— `a few minutes after, there was a loud knocking. I looked out, and was accosted in a language, that I could not understand—they were Hessians, I supposed; and my blood ran cold, for they appeared to be numerous; and their merciless nature was well known to us—they were of the beleaguering rabble, that formed the outposts, of the enemy, in their stupid ignorance of our nature—taught to believe, that we are savages; and, that if they were taken alive, they would be roasted, and eaten.' I could discover, from their gestures, that they were determined to force an entrance—and, one of them, a large, handsome man, levelled his pistol, two or three times, at my head—and at last, irritated by the delay, fired; but, the ball went wide of its mark. The next moment, he fell—Arthur had put a bullet through him. This was the signal for a general assault. Some dismounted—some ran to the barn; the leader, forbidding them to set fire to it, yet, lest the neighbourhood should be alarmed—or, such, at least, I took to be the meaning; for, one or two, who had lighted matches in their hands, trampled them out. They began to fire into the windows, with their pistols, but with so little effect, man after man, falling from their saddles, that they all dismounted, at last, and made an attempt upon the door. Every moment, I expected it to give way—the house rocked to its foundation; but, we were ready to receive them, with one heavy blunderbuss, three muskets, full of balls, and half a dozen cutlasses---when Mary rushed in, her hair all in disorder, shrieking, that she had seen a face, at the back window; and, that they were forcing their way, through the wood cellar, into the part, where the women were. `Go back this moment,' said I, `to the cellar—if they break in, utter no cry, and make no noise.' I had previously ordered all the fire to be extinguished. `Farewell Arthur—dear Arthur,' cried the distracted girl—throwing her arms round his neck.— `O leave me, leave me, Mary,' he cried, `not till you forgive me—never, never!”— `The noise at the door redoubled—I was indignant at the folly of the girl. Begone!' said I.— Her head dropped upon his shoulder—pale as death; but I saw him press his lips to her forehead, and heard him whisper something—at which she recovered—carried his hand to her lips—and left the room, with a firm, noble step, saying, `do your duty uncle—do your duty Arthur—we will do ours.' The words had scarcely passed her lips when I heard a tremendous crash, the door gave way, and Arthur cried—dash out the lights!— The order was instantly obeyed, and, for five minutes, there was an awful and bloody struggle among us. To this I attribute our safety—for they were afraid to deal a blow at last, and were receiving ours, continually— many of them died by the hands of each other, and by the light of every pistol flash, a man was seen to fall before Arthur or myself. I had no notion that a sword was a weapon of such power, in the hand of an inexperienced farmer—but I can assure you, my son, that every man, struck by me, was disabled. In the middle of this combat, we heard a stifled shriek—and immediately after, we found the floor giving way under our feet—it fell—the smoke and flames roared like a furnace through the roof:—the shrieks VOL. I. 6* continued—the cries of the women were heard on every side—a guard stood over us—but we cut our way through—and the first object that caught my view was the dead body of a man, cut from the head down, just falling with a woman in his arms—It was Mary!—her heart had broke—she was nearly suffocated in the smoke, but, obedient to her resolve, had determined to perish there, rather than bring her destroyer upon her, or alarm us.—But they had found her, and one was bearing her off when the sword of Arthur cleft his head open. There were other cries—`show no mercy,' said I— none!—hew them in pieces, men and women too!—and he followed me—every thing gave way before us—one of the women was suffocated, we have reason to believe, with poor Mary—one we saved—together with---O! there was one ruffian, with a red collar, whom I had pursued for ten minutes over burning rafters, through a whirl wind of fire, and clouds of smoke and darkness--- but could never reach him---but---a bullet did---Archibald dealt a blow for his mother,—I—I—your mother had fled---and I found her utterly powerless and insensible—I—' `I can tell you no more---something alarmed the sentinel---for after firing his pistol, which was unheeded by the troop, he rode in with a loud outcry, and the whole band were in their saddles directly.—Let us return.' He arose abruptly as he ended this, and walked before me, into the house---talking all the way to himself, as if unconscious of my presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “And always careless, always—even in fight.” Two whole weeks had passed away, and, such had been the effect, of their zealous co-operation, that our aged patriots had mustered one hundred and twenty-three well mounted horsemen, and nearly two hundred infantry, who, by the way, were wretchedly equipped. The whole country had taken the alarm—the tremendous, and unsparing violence of the Germans, who, most inconsiderately, in the royal commander, had been put forward in his extreme advance, forming a chain of posts, utterly unable to communicate with, or understand, or, to soothe the inhabitants; and, too weak, by far—fully beset with the notion, that we were a people of rebel savages, and, accustomed to put our prisoners to death, if not of cannibals; the falsehood of which belief, they only learnt, by being taken prisoners; after it had quickened their natnatural ferocity, and made them the scourge of all the country round—the futility of the royal protections, which were often thrust through with a bayonet, or scattered to the winds by these foraging banditti, under pretence, that they were unable to read them; or of utter disbelief, in their authority—these things, with the indiscriminate pillage, and butchery of friend and foe—and worst of all, the uninterrupted, and brutal profanation of our mothers, wives, and daughters, before our faces—by the living God, it is true!—a committee were employed in our little neighbourhood, to report upon the subject to congress, and the result was solemnly announced, that twenty-three women there, had been violated—twenty-three!—where the desire of concealment, in woman, herself, is hardly greater than it is in her brothers, fathers, sons —what a multitude must have been sacrificed, for so many to have been discovered, by accident!---for, by nothing but accident, could it have been discovered--- a secret, so terrible---a violence, so horrible to her nature. Men of America!---will ye ever forget it?--- if ye do, may your beautiful daughters and wives— no---that were too awful a malediction-- may ye and they, perish, strangled in each other's arms, suffocated in each other's blood!---these things, at last, drove us mad. We arose, as one people---a nation, about to offer up its enemies in sacrifice; and, had our disposition been rightly understood, the deep feeling of religion, which began to work, like leaven, within us, been rightly distributed, before the commencement of the spring campaign, there would not have been a man left alive, of our whole enemy---from Georgia to Maine---nor a hostile foot, able to leave its mark upon our land. We found our guest one of the strangest creatures in the world, altogether agreeable, and full of careless, self possession; and, though he chose to call himself Clinton, we had good reason to believe that his name was not Clinton; and, that he was an aid of the commander in chief; for, at the end of about two weeks, after several attempts to write, which, were successively made and abandoned, he called Archibald, who had become a great favourite with him, to his side, where he sat, lolling, with his sleeve ripped up, and looped all the way, to his shoulder, and his right arm in a sling; and, the following conversation ensued, between them. I have, already, spoken of his beauty ---it was generally of a frank, careless, aspect; but, at times, for a single moment, there was a lordly shadow upon his brow, and his dark eyes loured imperiously, like one accustomed to have his way, in spite of all the world, and impatient of contradiction, let it come from whence it would. He had been talking about the affair of the lakes; the gallantry, of Arnold (the traitor); the repeated attempts upon the shipping, up the North river; the ill advised defence of Fort Washington, the loss of which, he attributed to the advice of General Greene; though, he admitted that Greene manœuvred in a masterly manner, to save the military stores at Fort Lee—and finally, of the battle upon Long Island— and, Mr. Arnauld, of whom it is time that I should give you some clearer notion, than you have, sat listening to him, with ardent admiration and pleasure. Mr. Arnauld, was a small man, with a remarkably spirited face; handsome eyes, full of a melting softness; a rich, deep voice, and lips of a blood red—the most perfect gentleman, that I ever saw—doing, whatever he did, with that consummate self-possession, as if, no matter how sudden the emergency, or unpremeditated the thought, as if that alone had been the subject of all his preparation. At first, such was his readiness, that you could hardly persuade yourself out of a notion, that he had forseen, or contrived the event, or the remark, that brought out the peculiarity, of which I speak; but, in a little time, that suspicion would gave way, to the delightful certainty, that, happen what would, there was never such a thing in Arnauld's mind, as unpreparedness. His appearance, was not striking, nor his countenance handsome, till he became animated; but then, if the women were to be believed, he was the most dangerous man living. For my own part, I must confess, that, old as he was, when I knew him—and, then he was nearly old enough to have been my father, his manners were the most fascinating; the play of his countenance, the most eloquent; the carriage of his person, the most dignified and intellectual, if I can make myself intelligible, by such a word—(what I mean by it is, that there was more of the soul, in it)—than that of any other man, that I ever saw. He was not a learned man, I think, yet there was no theme, upon which, his passionate, and beautiful mind did not dilate with a force and brilliancy, at times, which took away my breath. He, it was, that gave me a taste for elevated, and fiery meditation. He was a profligate—a voluptuary---a sensualist, perhaps; for he fed his mind upon loveliness, and banquetted, all the day long, upon colour, and sound, and perfume, with celestial creatures. His very children, were a sort of spiritualities; and, though I loathed, and abhorred, the earthiness of his passion for women, yet he had the art of so sublimating, and colouring, whatever he chose to touch with his enchantment, that it was perilous as death, to listen to him, when set upon conquering your reason. I believe, that he had a good heart, and a brave one---that he loved his wife, to adoration, and would have torn away, his own heartstrings---split his own arteries, to make his children happier, for a single day, in any material thing. But let me return to Major Clinton, or Colonel, as we ought to call him. `Hither, Dapper,' said he, to Archibald, carelessly, `I want your assistance.' Archibald, lifted his eyes, slowly, to his face--- as if, I believed at first, that they meant to smile at the man's impudence; but, then a deeper hue came to them, as if it were well to put a stop to it, before it should be too late. He lifted his eyes, slowly, and fixed them upon Clinton's face, with a serious impression; not so much of displeasure, as of enquiry; and then, as slowly, dropped them again. `Dapper, I say!' said his persecutor, again, throwing a wicked glance at the girls, who sat nearly opposite---`come, come, I want to borrow your fingers.' `Colonel Clinton,' said Archibald, calmly, raising his eyes to the Colonel's face, `my name is Archibald Oadley.' Clinton laughed, and flinging his handsome leg out, as if a sudden pain, had just taken his breath away--- `will---you---then---Ar-chi-bald Oad-ley'---carricaturing the measured enunciation of my brother, so happily, that he smiled, in spite of himself, and Lucia coloured to the eyes, and gave a peevish sleat of the hand, as she threw by her work, that I saw did not escape the notice of Clinton, (for he glanced, rapidly, to and fro, three or four times, from one to the other, before he finished the sentence, like one reconnoitering) —`will—you—then—do—me—the—favour—to—write —pray, do you always talk with that solemn emphasis?—but, no matter, now—will you write a line for me?' `With all my heart,' said Archibald, seating himself, immediately, at the table; while Lucia hurried, with a petulant activity, to get the writing materials before him; occasionally glancing at the noble countenance of Clinton, and then, at the richly, delicate, but singularly intelligent one, of Archibald—in pity, I thought—and perhaps, for I did not like the compassionate trembling of her lips—nor the colour, that came, and went, so rapidly, about her temples— it was too like the expression of disappointment, and even shame. `All ready?' said Clinton. Archibald, bowed—dropped his pen again, into the ink. `Well, then—Dear General—have you got that?' Archibald, nodded. A profound silence, followed. `Damn it,' said Clinton, after wriggling backward and forward, in his seat, for a whole minute— `it is like drawing your teeth,' `Not mine, if you please,' said Archibald, lifting his pleasant eyes, again to his face. `Well mine, then. I'll tell you what it is—you'd better write it yourself—come, will you?—there's a good fellow!—no matter, what you say, so that he can't read it.' Archibald shook his head; and, Clinton continued —`for he was never able to read one of my letters, yet---stop---there's the date---put that down---whew!' there was another dead halt, of a minute or two, while every compassionate soul, in the room, was afraid to look up, lest it should add to his confusion---poor creature! he never suspected it!---`I'll tell you what, Dapper---I beg your pardon, Ar-chi-bald Oad-ley--- I'd rather winter a whole campaign, upon White Plains, than write a letter, any day---the first sentence, is so unspeakably difficult. That is the tenth time, that I have undertaken, to communicate the fact, that I am alive, hearty, and ready to return to duty, as soon as he pleases; but, hang me, if---stay---stay---make a full stop.' `O, that I did, half an hour ago,' said Archibald. `Well, then---now sign my name to it---George R. Clinton, A. D. C.---is it done?' `Yes,' said my brother, without changing countenance, but to whom shall I direct it?' `To His Excellency, George Washington.' The pen fell from my brother's hand, and we all looked up in amazement. `Why, what ails the boy?' said Clinton, `don't you mean to finish the letter?' Archibald took up the pen, again, with a trembling hand, and wrote the direction, biting his lip, as he did so---there was a strange variety of emotion in his face. `Is it done?' `Yes sir,' said Archibald, reaching it to him.— `Please to read it for me.'— Archibald read as follows:— `— New Jersey, 14th November, 1776..... Dear general..... George R. Clinton.... A. D. C.... To his Excellency, George Washington.'— Clinton stared him in the face, for half a minute, and then threw himself back into the chair, and laughed till the house shook again—and before he had ended, we were all laughing with him; all, I should say, except my father and mother, who sat a little apart from the rest, holding each others hands, and looking as if neither would ever smile again—and Arthur, poor fellow, he had left us, to go alone, where he would be welcome—among the armed children of America. `Well, well!'—continued Clinton, after this obstreperous peal had ended—`after all, I don't see but that will be a most acceptable letter—it will show that I am alive—in my senses—and he will know, at the first glance, that it is no counterfeit—that I must have dictated it—I say, I hope you have written with the wrong end of the quill—if you have, it may go down for something under my own hand—stop before you seal it— take up your pen again, dot it a little, here and there— and now just draw two or three crooked lines athwart the paper, and I will defy the devil himself to detect the counterfeit.—There—now seal it.'— Archibald followed his directions—folded, sealed and directed it. `You will be good enough, Mr. Arnauld, to have that conveyed, as soon as practicable to the out post at the Four Corners.'— `Is it possible!' cried Archibald, seeing that the thoughtless creature was in downright earnest—`would you really presume to send such a letter as that to George Washington?'— `Presume! why not?' `But such a barren affair—it will be an insult.'— `Pho—pho—it is the longest letter that he ever read from me in his life. Sometimes, when I have been in some hot scrape or other, for he is sure to send me, where more speed and horsemanship than brains are wanted, I have just scrawled the initials of my name and sent them—stop! that letter must not go in that fashion—just put down the initials—I am incog for a while, and he won't know me by the name of Clinton.' `Will you allow me,' said Mr. Arnauld, `to write a note for you?'— `O certainly,' was the reply, `but I see no necessity for another.... Mr. Oadley can just draw his pen over the name, and write G. R. C. under them—he will understand by that same letter three things, which are all that I could tell him, if you should write a whole day— for I told him, when he took me into his family, that— curse me, if I could either write letters, or copy them —but that I could carry them, through fire and smoke —into Sir Henry Clinton's quarters, if he pleased.'— VOL. I. 7 `Three things,' said Archibald—`what are they?' `The date, name and address—I suppose,' said Mr. Arnauld, pleasantly. `Pho,' you're all out. First (making a flourish with his left hand—) he will understand that I am alive—else I should not be able to dictate that letter. Secondly, he will understand that I am not able to write—else I should not have employed another. And thirdly, he will understand where I am, and send a wagon for me directly.—Now, what more could I tell him, if I blacked a quire of paper all over?—nothing—I hate your long letters.—I never read them—I have a trunk full at home, that I have just opened, far enough to count the pages—and put them by for—a rainy day— or a cold one—it matters not much which. Do you use any letters? you may have them—you're welcome to them all. I cannot deny that I have been brought into two or three unpleasant scrapes about them—but then, I can't read them, I can't, and what's the use of talking about it. If people will quarrel—why, that's another affair—I'm not fonder of it than most men, but I'd rather quarrel, with any body, than read a long letter.' `You have seen Washington, then,' said I, timidly. He looked at me a moment, from head to foot, as if indeavouring to understand whether I was in jest or earnest—and then answered `yes, almost every day, for the last six years.'— My father arose, and came forward—as if anxious to evince his respect for so favoured a mortal—and Lucia, it appeared to me, began to look about her, with a more distrustful eye, as if endeavouring to recollect all that she had been saying, in the festivity of her heart, before one, who had really seen George Washington, face to face—and I—I cannot deny that I felt a strange commotion within me, next, I believe, to what I should have felt in seeing the great man himself—nay, more than I did feel afterwards, when I actually saw him. `Well,' said Archibald, shrugging his shoulders— `even this is better than hearing of him—it is seeing him at second hand—seeing one that has seen him— what kind of a man is he?' `About the height of your father,' said Clinton, measuring the august old man, as he continued—`and not a little like him, in his carriage—about twenty-five years younger, however—with a broader forehead—a more awful meaning upon it—not so large, but boney— and in short—a man, before whom other men feel, and look, and act—like children—aye, sir, the wisest and bravest.—Haven't I seen the stoutest heart among us—hang his head, like a lubberly school boy, when the General but turned his face upon him for a minute, without uttering a word'—(There was a prodigious expression of soreness—or something else, in the movement of his haughty lip, as he said this.) `Do you love him?' said Archibald.— `An odd question, faith,' said Clinton—`to ask one of his own family!—however, I won't baulk you, my lad.—No—I do not love him—I cannot—he makes me feel my inferiority too sensibly, for that—but I would die for him, three times a day, for the rest of eternity; isn't that better than love?' `Not better than love,' said Arnauld. `Oh, of women you mean,'—answered Clinton, glancing at Lucia, who turned away her face with some little agitation, looking sideways at Archibald, as she did so. `O, that is another affair.—Whether I could love a woman or not would be hard to tell. All that I know of the matter is, that I have tried to, more than once, with all my heart and soul, and I could never get farther into her heart—and affections—than to be made a fool of— laughed at, first by her, and then by all the world— and then—however—I should love to be wrought upon once more, if it were only to keep me alive till the next campaign opens. Cannot you tell me, Archibald, of some blessed creature,' (his tone grew deeper—and the father glanced at him with a look of alarm, as if he would read his very soul),—`that could love a soldier all the day long—watch with him all the night long— live with him—die with him—and never write him a long letter.'—Clara laughed outright at the ludicrous association of deep feeling and levity, apparent, not less in the time of the stranger, than in his words— `why, you might as well inhibit the use of speech—at once,' said she. `No, no,' he replied—thrusting his whole hand, into his dark luxuriant hair, that shone in its abundance and disorder, as if it had never been touched with aught but the wind and rain—`there would be several objections to that—gallantry—the love of contradiction—the impossibility of the thing—what woman would ever surrender upon such terms—no, no, Miss Clara, an honourable capitulation is safer for both parties—if we give no quarter, we cannot expect any—beside there are some women, who wouldn't think my objection at all unreasonable, to long letters.' `Why not marry a deaf and dumb lady?' said Mr. Arnauld. `Why, to tell you the truth,' replied Clinton, carelessly throwing his left arm over the chair in which Lucia sat, so that his finely turned hand hung down by her shoulder—and touched it, I believe, in some subsequent movement, for she changed her position, and I saw his eyes flash, with a deeper expression of meaning, than I had ever seen before—and Archibald saw it too, I thought—for he held his face lower, and began a second time, at the top of the page, over which he was poring:—`to tell you the truth, that would be a needless preliminary—it would be well enough to be sure, to have her deaf and dumb at first.' `It might be a blessing to her,' said Lucia pettishly, in a whispering tone, meant for Archibald's ear, but he would not appear to have heard it. `Pretty well!'—continued Clinton, `pretty well!' for a beginner:—yes, it might be a blessing to her— and it certainly would be one to her husband, if her voice were not so full—of—of—hang me, if I could ever pay a compliment in my life, when I wanted to.'— Lucia turned entirely away from him, now, notwithstanding a gentle reproof of her mother, who moved her feet upon the fender, in the accent of admonition, and hemmed once or twice—while his nether lip worked, and the light shot through his long lashes, as if not an emotion or thought, of a single heart in the company, could escape him—and even Mr. Arnauld, when their eyes met, for a moment, and flashed a quick interchange of meaning, like electricity, ten thousand times more powerful and expeditious than your vulgar language of sound and syllable—appeared to be thoroughly understood by him. Heart answered to heart between them, for a moment, as if each had a telegraph in his own. `So then,' said Mrs. Arnauld, `you are for a deaf and dumb woman—vita mia!—' `O no—not at first—not till I was disposed to be a windower.—I should like a wife at first, with a head on. In a little time, I would answer for her being deaf and dumb too. My voice would make her deaf—my talking dumb.' `You would break her heart perhaps,' said Archibald, without raising his eyes. Clinton yawned—`probably,' said he—`probably— and after all, she might as well be deaf and dumb at first—if dumb the better for me—deaf, the better for her.—Yaw—aw—aw!—' `And I dare say,' continued Mrs. Arnauld, laying her hand upon his wounded arm, very gently, as she passed—`that it would soon amount to the same thing, if you rattled away, as you do sometime—you would make her forget her own language.'— `Or ashamed of it,' said he, putting his hand upon hers, with the consummate assurance of one long familiar with women. (The blood rushed over the temples of her husband, as he saw it, and darkened his eyes with a terrible shadow and lustre.) She caught his look, or rather felt it—for she withdrew her hand, and went to the window in silence—and stood there, for several minutes. VOL. I. 7* `Pray, Colonel,' said my father, addressing him with a gravity which if any thing in this world could have awed the licentious festivity of his nature, would have done it, `have you ever seen General Lee?' `Charles or Harry?'—said Clinton. `I do not know his first name, Colonel.' `Pray, old gentlemen.'—(Archibald threw down his book, and sat upright—but my father's eye fell, with a serious rebuke upon him, before he had time to interfere, and he gradually sunk into the same position again.) `I must tell you—and all of you, now that I think of it, to call me plain Mr. Clinton—some of the scoundrel enemy have penetrated thus far—and it might hurry us all into trouble, if they knew there was a colonel here. A sharp game has been playing of late—one of retaliation—they have sent Ethan Allen to England, in chains, and we have just taken Prescott.' We all assented to the proposition, and he continued, `I should like to stay with you a few weeks longer— till I am well enough to sit my horse, at least, for I like this hospital, I confess, rather better than ours in camp—that letter.' `Do you really mean to send that letter? then,' said Mr. Arnauld. `Yes—no—perhaps it would be as well—damn it— I beg your pardon ladies, a thought strikes me. I'll send for Jasper, and have the lads drilled and taught the broadsword—and then gallop into camp, as from the recruiting service, with a squadron of horse at my heels—and a broken arm. Yes Mr. Ar-chi-bald— please to add, that I am recruiting—a little injured in my right arm—and that, if he will order sergeant Jasper into this quarter, with four of my old troop, we will be ready, at a moment's warning, to cover any of his foraging parties, or cut up any of the enemy's, till there is an opportunity for more serious operations—just as he pleases—for pastime till—' Archibald wrote the very words down, and read them, to him. `Now—why the devil—damn this practice of swearing. Ladies, I beg your pardon—I have been too long in camp, not to offend, sometimes, where I would wish to avoid it—I am only astonished, that, when I wanted to say that, in black and white, just now, it was a matter so difficult.' `Would it not be well,' said my father `to give the commander in chief, some account of your capture?' `Report myself?—O, no—dead or disabled, he knows well, that I must be, to be absent for a whole day—yet, you may as well say, Archibald, that I have heard of the enemy, and were afraid of their cutting off my videttes, in detail—put it in your own language— and, that I was taken prisoner—and—' `Taken prisoner!' said Mr Arnauld. `By us, you mean,' said Clara, smiling. He nodded. `No, by the enemy; and, but for that young coxcomb, who fell upon them—I—ha!' Archibald shook his head, and Clinton continued— `say that I was taken prisoner, and rescued, by—' Archibald, threw down his pen, angrily, and Lucia turned about, her beautiful face all in a glow, with her passionate enthusiasm; while my father leaned half out of his chair, dropping the hand of my poor mother —and there was a breathless silence—`by—by—I am not permitted to tell whom, or how. There!—will that do?—and, add, if you please, Tinder-box, that, if his excellency pleases, I will stay here, till I am wanted—or, will—to protect the neighbourhood—' Archibald finished the letter; sealed it, and received a hearty shake of the hand, from Clinton, who lifted his dark, expostulating eyes, to him, and said something, in a low voice. `No,' said Archibald, firmly—`no, Colonel, remember your word—I shall hold you to it.' `Pray, Colonel,' said Mr. Arnauld— `Colonel!—Colonel!—again—Mister, if you please.' `Well, then, Mister Clinton—you spoke, a few moments since, of General Lee—is he popular?' `Exceedingly, with them that do not know him.' `A great soldier?' said my brother. `Yes—but, not the man for our cause.' `They mention his generalship, at the South,' said Mr. Arnauld. `I know it,' was the reply—the thing is wholly misunderstood. Fort Moultrie would have been given up—Sullivan's Island abandoned, if the advice of Lee, had been followed. He swore, that Sir Peter Parker would blow it into the air, with half a dozen broadsides. No—that affair is Moultrie's alone—he ought to have the whole credit of it, and he shall. For ten whole hours, he, and his raw malitia, and palmetto wood, held out, against the whole British fleet, in one uninterrupted roll of thunder and fire.' `But Lee has had a great deal of experience, abroad; and is a man of extraordinary talent, is he not?' said Mr Arnauld. Clinton turned pale upon him, and answered, more seriously, than I had ever heard him, before. `Yes, Sir; it is all true—but Lee is a tyrant—an aristocrat —and, if they that wish to see him, in the place of Washington, will put him there. I will answer for his being King Charles the First, before three campaigns are over. No, Sir—neither he—nor granny Gates, is the man to lead our armies. They are fighting for themselves—Washington for us. He risks nothing for popularity; takes all the peril upon himself, with the rabble of the army, and puts the strength and flower of it under the command of the very men, that would supplant him—but'—standing erect, his noble countenance, and haughty lip, all eloquent with deep and unutterable reverence, `God is with George Washington!' Clara—nay, even Lucia—my father—mother—all —all—every living soul—stood up, and unconsciously followed his movement—and, when the ceiling of the large room, resounded to the manly voice of Clinton, `God is with George Washington!' it seemed as if every voice had united in the acclamation; while Archibald, poor Archibald, stood looking, with his high soul sitting in his forehead, on Lucia and Clinton; as if—heaven only knows, if the thought be a true one; but, so it appeared to me—as if that burst of enthusiasm, in Clinton, had wrecked his happiness, forever—for, he went up to him; took his hand, and bowed his head upon it; and sat down, in silence, as if willing to give up—all—all, that was dearest to him, in the wide world, for the loud, and gallant testimony, that he had just borne to Washington. Lucia saw the action; and a strange, tumultuous light flashed over her white forehead; stirring her very hair, with the rush of her blood; while her eyes filled, and she came nearer to Archibald, as if she would have comforted him, if she could—but, he carefully avoided her eyes, and she was unable to speak. `But what think you of this system of retaliation?' said my father. `The best thing, in all the world, to bring the arrogant followers of his majesty, to their senses. After that d—d affair at the cedars, I wish you could have seen Washington's face. It was tremendous—and, when he wrote his last letter, by heaven, my blood ran cold. I could see, as plainly as I now see you, a hundred or two, of fine looking fellows, with epauletts upon their shoulders, swinging in the wind—I—' `Would he have done it?' said Arnauld, shuddering. `Would he—would George Washington do what he has once threatened?—yes—though the sun turned to blood, while he did it; and the sky fell in fragments at his feet—aye—though it rained fire upon him!' `But, how would that be possible?' said my father. `How could Washington stand by, and see men butchered, mangled, scalped, and roasted, as they were at the cedars?' `O, that was the wisdom of congress,' said Clinton. `Washington never promised such retaliation—he foresaw that, unless he wished to make his brave fellows as bad as the enemy, he could not enforce an exact, and scrupulous retaliation.' `Yet, it was threatened; and, it is not wise or dignified, for a nation to threaten, only.' `So I say; right or wrong, after you have uttered a threat, fulfil it. Bite; don't bark—but, if you must bark, bite afterward—right or wrong.' `That affair at Long Island, seemed to have lost Washington a part of his popularity,' said Mr. Arnauld. `Was it not rather too hazardous, to throw all his forces upon our island, accessible on all sides, to the enemy; where, if defeated, inevitable ruin must have followed.' `I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Arnauld; there is a dangerous, discontented spirit, among us: we seem to be weary already, of the good cause; anxious to down with our natural born men of America; our old fashioned republicans, and put any body---no matter whom---if he has been educated abroad, in their places. I use no disguise. Lee is a favourite with our patricians here, because he is a haughty, over bearing aristocrat; has been trained in Europe, among their princes and nobility; and, because—damn his impudence—nothing that we do, pleases him. He must have his finger in the pie, or all that is thought of, or done, is laughed to scorn. He goes about, among our women, with half a dozen puppies, of one kind and another, at his heels; growling and cursing, at every step; and we are fools enough to think it all an evidence of generalship. No, Mr. Arnauld, if Charles Lee had been our commander in chief, we should not have had a battalion in arms, at this moment; except his own body guards. I hold him to be the most dangerous man in America—and I know him well—and, between you and me; if they make him general of the American armies, I will make him a head shorter, with my own hand, on that day, before he sleeps.' We looked at him---the flashing of his eyes; the lordly swelling of his chest; and not one of us, questioned, for a moment, I will venture my life upon it, that he would have been as good as his word. The girls were in consultations, and had withdrawn to a deep sofa, in the opposite corner, where, with their arms intertwined, they had thrown themselves back, so that nothing could be seen, in the deep shadow where they sat, but an occasional glitter of the eye; or flourish of a white hand; or a languid flutter of drapery, as they changed their caressing attitude. The mother's countenance lighted up, to great beauty and expression, as she saw them---for there was more of her own spirit of coquetry, endearment, and self-possession, probably, in all this, than she had been accustomed to. `But,' continued Clinton, `the affair upon Long Island, was not so despcrate as you imagine. We were defeated, you know, yet we were not destroyed ---so there is fact, in answer to one of your speculations. But, what would have become of General Howe, had we whipped him?---we should have cut him to pieces. Something was to be done. Our men fought well, in their entrenchments, as Bunker Hill had shown ---it was proper to try them in fair field fighting. We could'nt give up New York, without a blow---the eyes of the whole country were upon us---a victory would decide the cause at once---a battle, if we were not beaten, would be a victory for us, because it would retard the operations of the enemy, accustom our troops to stand fire---and startle the country---and even a flogging, would be better than a dastardly retreat, without striking a blow---and, still better than being enclosed upon the island, or shut up in the city. These were the reasons of Washington---I know all his thoughts---I know that his great heart bled in the trial---that he was moved, even to tears, when he saw his poor fellows, rode down, in the marshes, and bayonetted rank after rank---but he had forseen it all, and prepared for it. You are mistaken, in another thing---his retreat was secured. We were in possession of a battery, that commanded all the East river ---we had left a force, in the city, to cover us; and the enemy had not a ship, nor a gun to bear upon us. God!---if he had only attempted to storm us, we should have played Bunker-Hill over again. Just before we embarked Washington rode up to us—' `You were there, then,' said Mr. Arnauld. `Yes,' said Clinton, colouring; but, without any change of voice, he continued to relate the alarming incidents that followed, and accompanied the embarkation; and, never intimated that he had had any personal concern in it, though we found, afterward, that he had been especially distinguished; and was engaged, for several hours, by the side of Colonel Smallwood, and his highblooded Mary landers---shouting, and cursing, all the while, like a fiend, and dealing death about him, through the smoke, and blaze, and thunder of the battle, as if that alone, were his element. Nor did he appear to avoid it, with any especial care---it was, really, I have no doubt, a matter of perfect indifference to him; for, when put to it, he spoke with the most natural expression of careless concern, about what he, himself, had done---just as if, chopping off the head of men had been about as serious a matter, as cutting the throats of so many cattle; or, cropping so many puppies. `But how providential,' said my father; locking his hands— `The fog, you mean,' replied Clinton—`why, as to that matter, every thing that happens, is providential. But, I see no especial manifestation of providence, there. We committed—or, rather, some of our officers committed, some damnable blunders, at the embarkation; and, we might have suffered, if the enemy had known it—and the fog was certainly a lucky affair; but, while I feel as thankful to God for it, as any body, I believe, for I was in the last boat that came off— and, the water was all in a foam about it, with their shot, when the fog was blown away—and, they opened upon us—yet, I am never in the habit of believing, in any especial manifestation of God's favour—where, if we believe in that, we must believe that he has led us into a scrape, just that he might bring us out of it. Why let us be whipped, and cut up, as we were, if— but you look too serious, for me—let us drop the subject—I am not a religious man; but I respect one that is—seeing death, as often as I do, I am afraid, has not made his countenance more welcome to me; and, it would be comfortable to me, to believe as other men do—but, I cannot—that is plain—I cannot. I venerate my Maker—I would die at his bidding—but dam'me, if I can bring myself to believe, that he is so ready to blow hot and cold, upon the same cause—sunshine and fog—or—I beg your pardon—I see that I have offended you all; so, let us say no more about it. God prosper the right!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. 8 CHAP. VI. “Prepare to guard!—now guard!—assault! “Now forward! forward! to the slaughter place!” Archibald and Clinton were perpetually together now.—Jasper had arrived, and while the troop was forming upon the broad, well trodden ground, in front of the house, Clinton would sit at the window, give the order, and direct them, in going through the divisions, while Jasper faced toward him, his back to the troop, and went slowly over the whole; and such was their zeal that, before another week had passed, my brother, who spent the whole of his time in the saddle with Jasper, or in conversation with Clinton, was able to go through the attack and defence, with the swiftness and precision of an experienced swordsman. Jasper declared that he had never seen any thing like it—`I shall be no match for him,' said he, `with that light blade of his, in another week—he parries, cuts, and gives point, all at the same moment.' And so it appeared to me—for when they met, and wheeled, there was often one incessant clatter, and blaze and sparkle, for two or three minutes at a time, as they went round the enclosure, with all eyes upon them. `Admirable!' said Clinton, catching Lucia's hand, and then dropping it in dismay, as he saw the alteration in her face—`admirable!' `What was that?' said I, as I sat upon my horse, near enough to the open window to hear and see all that passed within the room, while my horse reared at the flash of Archibald's sword.—`What was it? I saw the light, but my eye could not follow the motion.' `Sword arm protect—bridle arm protect—St. George— cut in the rear,'—answered Clinton, leaning half out of the window in his eagerness—`damn this arm of mine—I am impatient to try that fellow's mettle myself—he is quicker than lightning—he and his mare seem to be animated by the same soul.'— As he spoke, the mare leaped—the line broke, and she dashed among them, like a mad creature—Archibald's weapon swinging at his wrist, by the sword knot, and wounding her at every plunge. Lucia turned pale as death, and caught Clinton by the arm, but he appeared unconscious of it, for he leaped headlong from the window, just as she uttered a shriek, reeled away, and covered her face with her hands. I now saw the reason—Archibald had lost the stirrup, and was almost upon the neck of the mare, who ran straight across the field, turning neither to the right nor left—for hedge nor ditch, nor tree. There was a mortal silence—the horses were all reined up, with a convulsive motion—and Clinton stood with his arms outstretched—There was a large tree in front—an oak—the branches low—and the mare driving directly under them.—Gracious God! at the very moment when we expected to see Archibald struck from the saddle—his brains dashed out, we saw the sword fly from his wrist—the mare turn a little aside, and Archibald spring to the ground—bring her about, in a broad sweep, and leap upon her back again, like a circus rider.—There was a general shout of admiration—`a winged mercury indeed!' said Mr. Arnauld. `Yes,' groaned Clinton, contracting his forehead, with pain, as he restored his shattered arm to the sling—`but damn such freaks, I say. I would no more have that fellow in our riding school, than a lighted rocket in a powder magazine—he and his mare would play the devil with our sober Connecticut jockeys—the whole camp would be a place of ground and lofty tumbling, if they were once among the Virginia lads. But what the devil set him a going Jasper? didn't he parry your point?—I could have sworn that his touched your side, twenty times, before you parried it—ha!' Jasper held up his sword in reply—it was broken about six inches from the hilt. `How happened it? did he parry?' `Parry—damn the fellow—yes—and before I could come to offside protect, he gave me a cut, that shattered my sword—and made my arm numb to the elbow— (shaking his fingers as he spoke)—zounds! I believe the bone is splintered—but here he comes.'— Archibald rode up—flushed with heat, and terrour— and the mare covered with blood. The point of the broken sword had wounded her, it appeared, in the flank. Archibald could have borne any thing better— `poor Hetty—woa! woa! poor creature,' said he— (staunching the wound, while the flesh of the animal shivered, at every touch—and the blood flew in his face like rain)—`I'd rather be wounded myself—but— woa! woa! I knew that something must have happened, and it's well for her,' he added, turning to us—his white forehead all spattered over with her blood—that she has a good excuse for such deviltry—or.'— `What would you have done?' said I. `Cut her throat upon the spot,' he answered, in the same tone. `His very nature has changed,' said Lucia, as she stood leaning upon her sister, pale as death, her black hair shadowing half her face. To which Clara seemed to assent, while she put out her dazzling hand to adjust it—for their eyes encountered, and the quick, incessant sparkle of Clara's, stopped for a moment, with a dash of mournfulness--- and her red lips were slightly compressed---perhaps in sympathy with some inward contraction---perhaps with the effort that she made, just then, to thrust the long comb, into the collected mass of hair, which she had just parted upon her sister's forehead, and carried back, and curled up, in the true spirit of a painter. `But how in the name of heaven, did you get into the saddle again?---are you accustomed to such evolutions?' Archibald continued patting the neck of his mare, while her blood-shot eyes—swelling nostrils—agitated breath—and quivering limbs—showed that she was not wholly subdued.—`Woa! woa! Hetty, woa!— no, it was altogether an accident—the impetus of our motion carried me back to the saddle—woa!—woa!— will you—the sword knot gave way—run Simmons, and find the sword—there by the tree, somewhere— you will see by the track of the mare.—I shouldn't have managed her else—never was I so near a sommerset in my life, and to this moment I don't know how— woa!—woa!—how I got into the saddle again—my head is giddy with the effort.—I remember throwing myself off, as soon as I was able to disengage my wrist, from the sword knot—and I lost the stirrup by it— but how I got back again, I know not; it appeared to me that I kept on—just struck the ground in a semicircle—brought the mare round, by holding on the rein, involuntarily—when she took me up again, by completing the circle.' `And so it appeared to me,' said Clinton, `it was a d—d dangerous affair though—a pretty diagram might be made of it—.' `Handsome, Bill, wasn't it?—' said Jasper to one of his own men—`we must try it over in the riding school.'—`You'd better take that tree with you then,' said Bill—`aye, and the mare too—and the rider---or you won't be able to carry it through, my lads,' said Clinton.—`But look to the mare Jasper---you are somewhat of a farrier, or used to be, when I commanded you.' Jasper touched his hat---and then apologised for such an unmilitary salute—by bringing up the hilt of his broken sword, square to his face, the flat of his hand in front—with that air of military precision, and briskness, which is peculiar to the drill sergeant and fugleman. `Keep your men in their saddles, five hours a day. We shall be wanted soon. Be ready at a moment's warning.—I will be your commander till a better one VOL. I. 8* can be had---in the meantime, there is Archibald---what say you? shall he be your captain?' said Clinton. `Aye, aye!' cried the whole troop---`Oadley forever!---Oadley! hourra for Oadley?' Archibald looked up—all the blood of his heart rushed to his face---and then retreated, as suddenly---leaving him white as a drowned man---and his eyes filled. Not a human being had expected it---not one---and from none had the thought been further, I am sure, than from him. He went to my father, looked him in the face--- and then round to all the troop, man by man, without uttering a word---they all understood him---and some turned away their faces---some passed the back of their right hand over their eyes---and filed off, one after the other, as if they had not the heart to interrupt such a silence. `Clinton---Clinton---I---I—' he tried to add something else, but he could not---his lips moved---and he carried Clinton's hand to his heart. `I understand you, my fine fellow, say no more about it---you are their captain.---I will answer for your confirmation.—Work them hard this week, and Monday morning next, rain or shine, we will gallop into camp—. Ah---look yonder---what are they?---red coats, by God!—Mount, mount your, horses!—' `To horse! to horse!' cried Jasper. `Into your saddle Oadley, (to me) and stand by your brother.---Order out my sorrel---put the holsters on--- see that the pistols are in order. I can still aim a ball!—away with these infernal trappings —' As he said this, he tore asunder the sling; but as he did so, and attempted to straighten his arm, streaks of red shot up to his temples---and the sweat started out upon his lips—he could not abide it---he staggered to the sofa. In a few minutes after, a fine looking young fellow rode up, threw himself from his horse, and stood, abruptly before Clinton, without asking any questions. `How dare you!' said Clinton, scarcely able to utter an audible sound, while Lucia stood aside, looking at him, with her hands locked upon her bosom— `there are women here.' The young fellow blushed—bowed—took off his high cap, with a gay, rioting air,—and presented a letter. `Read it, Clayton,' said the Colonel.—He read as follows. `Muster your men, if you can sit in the saddle. The General was alarmed about you. I was very sad—and, to my notion, you will be dealt plainly with. The New Englanders, will not be appeased else— they and the Pennsylvanians are ready to go to loggerheads—. I saw him—the General—when your note came—his hand shook on opening it—but he smiled, or rather looked a little less serious than usual; when he had done, and handed it to Mercer—who answered, as he returned it. `You'll never make anything of him, I am afraid.' `I am afraid not,' said his excellency, `so Grafton', `Hush! hush!' said Clinton—read no names, if you please—what else does it say.—' `Something is in agitation, I am sure—make haste in—all may, go well yet.— Yours forever and ever—.' `Well Sir,' said Clinton,—`where is the main body now?' `At Newark.' `How many are you?' `Three thousand five hundred, at the last muster— on the 22nd.' `What the devil do you mean, Clayton?—How many in all?' `All—upon my honour.—I made the return, with my own hand—the whole American army under Washington now, are only three thousand five hundred men.' `Gracious God!'—exclaimed Clinton, dropping his arms, lifelessly, over the sofa—`then shall we have to go, as he told me himself, back of the Alleghanies.— Well—go where he will—when he will, I will go with him.—Did you see any of the enemy, in the wood?' `No—the farmers are mustering though, all about us.' `I thought,—were there no red coats on the left, upon the hill, yonder?' `I saw none,' was the reply. `Any men with you?' `We are about twenty or so—they halt in the wood there, we are part of a covering party—and have taken some prisoners.' `Mount every man of you, this moment—put yourself under the command of that young fellow, that you see there (pointing to Archibald, who was leaning forward, and adjusting the curb of his mare—)—`there are red coats in the way—follow close upon them—but hazard nothing:—on your lives, do not bring them to battle, unless you are two to one.—To horse, Clayton! to horse Jasper!—and see if we cannot take in some prisoners to our commander—keep out upon their flank—watch them—and cut off any stragglers.—To horse!—' `I wish to heaven, Colonel, that you could go with us,' said Clayton, hesitating—`I—. Clinton shook his head—`no, no, it is impossible— I tell you!—don't drive me mad—begone to your duty, Sir.' In ten minutes more, we were all upon the way— nearly one hundred and fifty strong, our whole family, Arthur and all; for I caught a glimpse of him, just before we came in sight of the enemy—our horses full of blood, snorting and neighing—and the very earth, it did appear to me, shaking under them. Even Arnauld, and my old father, breathing hard, like old war horses straining upon the bridle, rode side by side with me—shaming the youthful, brief ardour of all the young men, with their awful solemnity of forehead and eyes. I rode near Clayton, and I observed that he kept his eye, with an uneasy, doubtful expression upon my brother; and at last, as if impatient to put his heart at rest, spurred up abreast of Jasper, and asked him some questions, to which Jasper returned a reply, with a loud oath—and then there was a contemptuous movement of Clayton's lip, that made my blood boil, as he renewed his observation of Archibald. `You shall see! if we come off well, there. You shall see, Clayton,' said Jasper, training his heels, and heaving up his chest, with a look of the greatest exultation—`wait a little, my boy, and you shall see what stuff he's made off.' Clayton returned to the ranks, with an angry, dissatisfied look that—there was a wrathful movement of my heart, for a moment; but I kept it down, and we rode on peaceably enough, for a whole hour. But our course was soon interrupted—a man on horseback, dashed athwart our way, about two hundred rods ahead, in the uniform that my father knew—for he was after him, like a bloodhound, without waiting for the word, over hedge and ditch. Jasper followed— Arthur—Clayton—and my brother was preparing, when he saw some appearance on the edge of the wood, about half a mile off, that arrested his eye; and the next moment, a boy came up to us, all in a foam, with a note, which forbad him to advance a step—saying, that the enemy were out on the right and the left; his camp broken up; and the country overrun with his light horse and dragoons. `Trumpet!' cried my brother. `The trumpet sounded. A martial quick reverbration followed, too far off, and too distinctly for an echo. Our stragglers wheeled, with their prisoner, whom my father, it appeared, had brought to the ground, horse and all, with one of his outlandish cuts. And the next moment, a body of horse, in beautiful style, came out from the wood at full gallop, as if reconnoitring us; wheeled, in a circuit of nearly half a mile, and then trotted, and then halted—though much less numerous than ourselves—as if in defiance —nay, some of the rascals, after waiting awhile, had the impudence to dismount in our faces, as if to turn their horses loose. `What say you, brother?' said I, `shall we down upon them?' `Not yet,' he replied, keeping his eye upon them, `we are not double their number—my orders are strict—we are now in actual service—I have too much at stake—there is some stratagem there—`fellow! (to the prisoner) how many are there?' He smiled sullenly, and threw a ferocious glance at my father, who—heaven bless the old man---sat upon his horse, precisely as he used to, of a Sunday, when going to church; with the same substantial, deep gravity—a little more sorrow and sternness, perhaps; but with no appearance of emotion. Archihald soon learnt the truth. Cornwallis, was out---Washington had struck his tents, and was retreating before him, bag and baggage. Every moment was invaluable. `Ha!---I thought so!' said my brother, `Form!---form! Father!---brother!— cousin Arthur!---Mr. Arnauld!---hither!---hither!---we must ride abreast!' The enemy appeared to be preparing for a charge, and one after another, came galloping from the wood, until their number appeared rather larger than our own. I looked at Jasper, and Clayton, and the regular troopers---their lips were all compressed---their eyes rivetted upon the enemy---their horses reined up ---and swords resting, with the hilt, just in the hollow of their thighs. I looked at our men---there was no difference---there seemed to be the same promptitude, coolness, and precision in one as the other. Even our old father brought his heavy broadsword to a carry, as if he had done nothing else all his life, than carry sword. `Prepare to guard!' said my brother. The swords flashed, all at once; and every man sat, at the same moment, with his bridle hand, and sword hand, in front of his breast. It made my very heart leap to see it. `Look to your pistols,' said my brother, `but never use them. Take their fire; but don't return it till your swords fail you.' The horses became strangely impatient---snorting, stamping, and straining upon the bits---the enemy, too, as if disconcerted by our coolness, or suspecting ambush, or waiting a reinforcement, held back. Their appearance was beautiful---the ground was all covered with snow, far and near---their dazzling uniform, and large showy horses, full of mettle, and impatient to snuff the wind and smoke of battle:---altogether, it was a sight well fitted to thrill the blood, and give that deep, delirious feeling of terrour and passion to the the young heart, which rouses it, like fire thrown into the den of a wild animal. One of the enemy, stationed upon a hill in their rear, now gave some signal, that changed their course, for they reined short about; and trotted slowly along the side of the hill, while he kept upon its verge, as if watching the movement of some other body, below, in the opposite plain. `This will never do,' said Archibald; `they may be leading us into ambush---we must take higher ground, and always be prepared to come to battle, or not, as we please. Carry swords!---right wheel!---trot!' `Right wheel!---trot!---' echoed behind us---rank after rank---as they wheeled, from the line, where we stood, six deep---and trotted gallantly round, to a more commanding elevation. `What think you, now?' said Jasper, falling a little out of place, to exchange a word with Clayton. `Think!—damn it—I think that you have been humming me—he a raw recruit!—no—I knew better, the first time that I saw him in the saddle. He has seen service!' `So they say,' was the reply; and Jasper spurred to his place again. I could not but look behind for a moment—where I saw Jasper's red face shining, with the honest exultation of his heart—his little eyes twinkling, as if Archibald had been his own son: and there was Clayton, now—I began to like him—keeping his horse's head in line; and whenever he could get an opportunity, trying to adjust himself to the saddle, and sit like Archibald. For myself, I can hardly tell what my feelings were. First, there was a rush of fierce, terrible delight—and then, a brief alarum in my heart; followed by a sort of religious fervour, exceeding wrath and indignation, tranquilized and subdued, as if God and his angels were fighting with us. Nay, at the very onset; when the word had been given to charge!—and all the hills round, rung with the melody of trumpets—the neighing of horses, and the shouting of their riders—when we had joined battle, and I heard nothing but the shriek of women—saw nothing but the pale, wasted face of my poor mother—and the dead body of Mary, under the hoof of trampling horses—there was no feeling of terrour, in all this—none!—but there was a sublimity, that distended my whole heart, as with fire, and flood, and tempest—and when, in the thick of the battle, our ranks were broken, and each was wrestling, man to man, with his adversary, on foot, or on horseback— the face of my father and brother, and that of the death struck Arthur, went by me, in one rank, as I thought— and all fled before them! After all this, I know not what happened, until my horse stumbled among the dead bodies, and threw me into a mass of human blood and trodden snow. God! how the field looked. But stay!—I am anticipating. Is it not wonderful. I had stood, and gazed upon my brother, not a minute before, after the blood of one man was upon him—and listened to his composed voice, and fancied that there was something preternatural in it—but now, I was dripping with it, from head to foot—and I felt no other emotion than a little loathing and sickness. Is it not wonderful! that timid and peaceful men, who had never seen the red blood run trickling from the bright blade of a butcher knife, without a quick trepidation of the heart—youthful, too, like Archibald, and Arthur, and myself, in the very spring tide of our gentleness and compassion— or grown old, like my father and Arnauld, in the beautiful hushed tranquillity of a farmer's home, that had never seen the gleam of a broad-sword, nor heard the bugle call—nor the neigh of cavalry, nor the loud, quaking reverberation of heaven and earth, beneath the tread of horses and horsemen, rushing to battle—that such men should sit as we sat, breathing hard, and straining, like blood hounds in the slip—all our veins swelling with impatience for the outcry of death!—. O, is it not past all belief that such changes should be wrought with such instantaneous suddenness! Yet so it was—the grey hair of my mother whistled about my face, and I felt as if the shadow of Mary rode at my side, with one incessant moaning cry of violation.— What Arthur felt, I know not—but there was the settled aspect of death upon his forehead, wherever I met him; and wherever he appeared, the very horses made way for him—for his riding was that of one commissioned of God—no sound, no cry, escaped him—But drugged to the very lips, saturated to the very skin with blood---he still smote his way onward, and wrestled and dealt giving no quarter, showing no mercy. And my father too---I saw him only for a moment---after the enemy broke through our little squadron---riding, with all his might, breast to breast with Archibald, and—O, there are passions and passionate thoughts in the human heart---veins and vessels, innumerable and delicate---unseen and hidden---unknown and unsuspected---till a preparation of blood and fire hath been poured into it. Then, like the morbid anatomy of death—the secret and mysterious winding of every channel---with all its subtle and exquisite ramifications---becomes slowly articulate and vivid, with the rush of the infusion. But let me have done with this, my children, and return to the preparation in hand. We were coming along, in a slow trot, as I have told you, upon the brow of a hill---apprehending no danger, and sure of our power to retreat at pleasure---when, all at once, the man on the hill gave a signal, which we had reason to VOL. I. 9 believe, conveyed some unexpected intelligence to the enemy, for he immediately set up a shout, wheeled at full gallop, and approached us, in a most gallant style. `Masterly! by God!'—cried Jasper—`rein up! rein up!'— `Gallop!' said my brother—`Gallop!'—He was instantly obeyed and we came round where we could only be assailed in front—a high bank sheltering us in the rear—a broad ditch, and several heavy broken stone walls covering our right, and the left entirely open to us, if we chose to escape.—The enemy grew stronger and stronger, as he approached—I saw Jasper throw a troubled look at Archibald—and the next moment, Arnauld spurred up to him at a headlong speed, pointing to another party, that were just dashing athwart the creek— one after the other—about a mile off. `It is too late now,' said my brother—`we have nothing left but to do our duty,'—then, in a loud voice, he proclaimed his intention—`to conquer or die.' The words were scarcely out of his mouth before the front rank of the enemy fired their pistols almost in our faces, wheeled, and were followed by a second, and a third without drawing a blade. Several of our men fell; two or three of the horses broke out of line, or ran back upon their fellows— and Archibald, who had never been apprised of this mode of attack, appeared confounded for a moment— when, just at that time, a covered wall, in our front, which we had not seen till then, and against which the snow had drifted, brought up the front rank of the enemy, as they were preparing to wheel upon us and to follow up the charge with their swords—and a universal confusion and embarrassment prevailed. `Now is the time!' cried Archibald—`now is the time!—down upon them my brave fellows!—remember Mary Austin!' At the sound of that cry, out leaped a horseman, from the middle of the front rank, and the whole troop rushed headlong upon the enemy, shouting `Mary Austin!—Mary Austin!—Down with the Hessians!' We were instantly among them—disordered, it is true, and utterly broken up, by our own impetuosity, and the nature of the ground; but the enemy were more so—their horses were weaker—and less accustomed to the snow; they stumbled at every step—fell, and rolled over us, and about us in every direction. Not a shot was fired now—every man joined battle, sword in hand, with whoever was nearest to him; and such was our tremendous desperation that twice, before I could suspend the blow, or see my man, I exchanged a cut with one of our own troop. In the middle of this—the whole field, as far as I could see covered with horse and horsemen—battling in their saddles—on foot—or rolling over on the ground, like so many gladiators— I saw one rank, the only unbroken one, rush by us— and I had just time to see all the faces in it that were dearest to me—when Archibald's voice was heard again shouting—`form! form!—trumpet!' `They are rallying!' cried Jasper—`in upon them now!—the day is our own!—hourra, my boys?—hourra my fine fellows!'—And then, by heaven, there was a sound afar off, martial and wild—it was the sweetest melody that I ever heard in my life—it seemed as if a rank of bugles had been blown all at once, above our heads. There was a general pause of astonishment and delirium—but the pause was only for a breath; a party of the enemy appeared rapidly forming anew, and all at once, there came, thundering round the hill, another body—`Virginia forever! Virginia!—hourra for Virginia!' cried somebody at the left. `By heaven and earth!' cried Clayton, and another named Crawford, both of whom were wounded and one unhorsed—`now, my boys you shall see some fun!'— I reined up—and twenty others did the same, while the enemy endeavoured to rally in two or three places—but the Virginians gave them no time, for they actually rode down the first party, without exchanging a shot, and then divided and scoured the field. It was then that my heart failed me—my head swam. I could no longer distinguish friend from foe—my horse tumbled, and when I came to my recollection, I was smeared all over with the blood and brains of a poor fellow, upon whom I had fallen. I arose and attempted to stand—there were at least thirty or forty human beings about me, dead and dying—the snow all stained and trodden--- here a wounded horse snorting and pawing—and sweeping his blood red mane over the snow, and shuddering so, as to throw the blood from it like spattering rain, all about him,—there a rider trying, again and again, to disentangle himself from a struggling animal—A loud groan—a suffocated neigh—a deep harrowing execration—a word or two of prayer---and now and then a shriek that went through and through me, I could hear.----I arose upon my feet—astonished to find life enough left for it—I was frightened too, to find it so late—the stars were already beginning to appear— merciful heaven!—could it be that we had been so utterly defeated!—I stood and listened—but there was no sound of pursuit. Then it was that I would have lain down and died—stiffened and cold as I was—for I began to feel that I had been stunned—and that our party must have been cut to pieces, or we should not have been left to perish in the snow. I was not then aware how late it was in the afternoon when, we met— but my disordered memory made me feel as if I had been left a whole day to die. My blood grew warmer—and I saw another man, and another moving, as if they would soon be able to arise. One of them succeeded—I know not what he felt—but all my hostility was dead—I could as readily have struck a knife into the heart of my own brother, in the presence of God himself—as to strike hands in wrath, under a sky so cold and blue—in the awful stillness of evening—after such a day of peril and wrath. We advanced—he hesitated—it was one of the enemy!—poor fellow—he was as little disposed as I, for another mortal encounter— for though, while he put one hand to his forehead, and staggered, like one giddy and blind with pain—the other fall to his left hip, by a sort of mechanical motion—yet it was almost as instantly withdrawn, and extended.— After a pause, I gave him mine. God bless the poor fellow! We were so weak, both of us, that we leaned, for a moment, upon each other's bosoms—and then, he sank upon the snow, reaching his hand to me again —and uttered, in a broken, inarticulate voice, `um Gottes Willen!' I had taken him by the arm, with a feeling of brotherhood; for that never deserted me yet, blessed be God—but a groan, that I knew, thrilled my blood, and wrought, like returning animation, to a frozen man—ten thousand inconceivable pains. I dropped the poor fellow's hand—it fell like that of a corpse---and followed, as well as I could, in the sudden darkness and terrour of my mind, the melancholy sound that I had heard. It was my father's voice—it was!—he was just able to show that he knew me—to put out his hands to me, as if with a blessing, when the bugle rang again, and down came a body of horsemen—two hundred, at least —friends or foes, I cared not—I never left my father —nor lifted my eyes—nor dislodged his venerable head from my arms, till I heard the voice of Archibald, in a tone of distraction, crying to `dismount!—dismount! and collect the dead.' `O, my father!—my father!—my brother!' he cried —running hither and thither, about the field—`O!' He heard my voice—it was very feeble, but he heard it—and we were instantly weeping in each other's arms. `Unhurt? my dear, dear brother?' said I. `O, I know not,' he replied—`nor care—Jasper! —Jasper!—here!' We soon found, to our unspeakable joy, that our father was not mortally wounded, as we had reason to believe, but was rather faint from the loss of blood; and, perhaps, a dislocated shoulder—and we were soon on our way. I was unable to ride. We soon understood the cause of the delay. Our party had been victorious, and while our division pursued the enemy, taking a number of prisoners, and marking their route, by dead bodies—another had ridden about VOL. I. 9* the neighbourhood, for carts and carriages to convey the wounded. I was put into one tumbrel—with my father; on each side of us, rode a horseman—one of whom I knew, but the other was a stranger. `Archibald!' said I; to the first, `where is Arthur?' `Arthur?' `There!' was the reply; pointing to the horseman on our right. `Not in the cloak?' `Yes—that cloak he took, with his own hands, from an officer, and hurled him, headlong to the earth, at the same moment.' The horseman fell back, as if just recollecting where he was---threw off his cloak—rode past us, in silence, and flung it into the carriage. `Poor Arthur!' said he, `his heart is untouched yet. How has he escaped?' `Wrap it round his body,' said Archibald, coming up, as I began to envelope my father with it. `He escaped miraculously; but his roan was killed, and himself a prisoner, once.' `And you—' `I know not—the pistol bullets troubled the mare for awhile—I felt sorry for her—the smell of gunpowder, is rather unpleasant, when burnt near enough to singe her eyelids—poor Hetty!—woa—woa.' I turned about, willing to make him feel that such levity was horrible, at such a time, in one so young— but there was such a mortal lividness in his face, that, struck with terrour at the thought of his being deranged, I had well nigh shrieked aloud; but he rode on— the cold moonshine coming down upon our cavalcade, with every variety of light and shadow, as we wound our way over the dazzling snow—the steel scabbards of the horsemen, ringing and glittering at every step— the solemn trampling of the horses—their blowing— the crushing snow—the heavy lumbering of the loaded wagons, loaded with the dead and dying, friend and foe—the hour—the awful stillness about—and, in truth, I can well say, that I have never felt, from that moment to this, such an overpowering sense of mortality. The household were already apprised of our approach; yet, who can describe the meeting. Daughters and fathers—husbands and wives! Arnauld was wounded too, and very seriously—for he had fought, with a desperation that appalled the stoutest of the young men—perhaps, from the terrour of falling alive into the hands of them, to whose prince he had probably sworn allegiance, as he had taken his protection. His daughters ran to him—but their grief, bitter and cruel as it was, had nothing of the unutterable sorrow of the wife. Lucia fell upon her knees, held his pale hand to her lips—wiped away the frozen blood from his temples, (for he had fallen near my father, and lain there, motionless and stiff, till the dead carts came by,) with her own hair, and wept upon his forehead and eyes. Clara sat down by him, and pressed her delicate hands, with all her might, upon her heart—holding her breath, as if the first sound would be a shriek. The mother—the wife—the beautiful and passionate—O, who shall tell the sorrow of her spirit? She tore open the bosom of her lord, called distractedly upon the surgeon!—Clinton!—Oadley!---and her children! Then, while the tears gushed out of her beautiful eyes, till they blinded and choaked her, she would yield to the gentle violence of Clinton, who sat by her, and held her hands in his, until Lucia, herself, leant upon his bosom, and not as upon the bosom of a brother. Archibald's tread sounded behind me—he had already been with our blessed mother—and I—I had not. I rushed by him, but the hue of his face, frightened me—he stood, with his eyes upon Lucia, unable to speak, or move. I ran in to my mother—I found her calm, patient, awfully collected, sitting by the bed, upon which my father lay; and stayed no longer, than to hear our surgeon pronounce him in no danger—and to see her—who had been so collected and immovable, till then—at the sound of that judgment, throw herself upon his neck, stranger as he was, and sob there aloud, as if he had been her own son—nay, her only son—and then, sink down upon her knees, with an expression of the deepest thankfulness, and bury her agitated, altered face, in her hands, till—I was fain to fall upon my knees beside her, and kiss her wasted forehead—and then leave her—for—it may as well be told, the natural yearning of my heart, in a measure appeased by this duty to my mother, I had others—another—the whole force of which, I knew not till that moment. Poor Clara—poor, dear Clara—thou! the haughtiest of women—thou, whom I had sworn, in my own heart, five years before, when I was an awkward clown, to humble to the dust—O, now I saw thy proud spirit, brought down with consternation and sorrow— tenderness and—and—love?—yes, it was love—it could be no longer concealed. She hid her face in my bosom, and I felt her warm tears, trickling into my very heart—her trembling hands giving way, at last, to the convulsive expression of long smothered feeling—her heart beating vehemently against mine, and her warm cheek, unconsciously resting against mine---the same blood circulating, I almost believed, through both of our frames, at the same moment. I wept too---I will not deny it---wept the more, for having, like herself, so studiously concealed my passion, for whole years---and yet, sorrowing as I did, that one I loved, should sorrow as she did---rejoicing, nevertheless, to see one, prouder than Lucifer---colder, it was thought, than the unsunned snow---reposing, with the helpless and enchanting confidence, of tried love, upon my bosom---mine!---where I had never hoped to feel the forehead of any woman, reposing; and last of all, a woman, whose very hand I had not dared to touch; whose very name, I never could bring myself to pronounce, but with an affection of dislike ---or at least, of qualified friendship. `But where is Archibald?' said Clinton, putting his lips to the forehead of Lucia---by heaven, it is true!---and I told Archibald of it, and that the colour did not even rush to it, as if to reprove the unlicensed touch. But he only shook his head, patiently, and smiled---poor fellow---so that it brought the tears into my eyes. `He was here, a few moments since,' said the surgeon, and the next moment, as if the sound of his name brought him into sight, he stepped forward--- advanced, as if to offer some assistance; dropped his eyes, as if unwilling to meet the eyes of Lucia; who, just becoming sensible of her situation---so young--- so beautiful---her black hair all dishevelled---and dashed eyes, swimming in light and tearfulness---and cheeks burning with shame; was endeavouring to draw her shawl over her partially exposed bosom, with an agitated hand---a— `Archibald!' said she faintly, `you are not wounded, I hope?' without daring to look up. Her hands were just at that moment, employed in parting her hair upon her forehead, to keep it out of her eyes. `Not mortally, Lucia,' said Archibald, with a tone that went to my heart, (her hands fell into her lap, motionless as death), `but deeply, irretrievably.' I know not if Archibald meant it---or observed what I did; but Lucia's head dropped, and I saw the tears fall, drop after drop, upon the dark dress of her mother, upon whose bosom she leant. He went to her; took her hand---it lay passively, in his---and fell not, even when he opened his own, as if to relinquish it. `Lucia, hea---heaven bless you--- farewell!' said he; carried it to his lips, and left the room.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “And there were sudden partings, such as press “The life from out young hearts.” Not one of the household slept that night; but we had the comfort to know, long before morning, that Mr. Arnauld, whose leg had been bruised, arm dislocated, and head cut in two or three places, had little to apprehend; while our sturdy old father, we were assured, would be well enough to mount his horse, in a few days, at furthest, having escaped with a few flesh wounds, and the loss of about half his blood. I wanted to see Arthur, for I had not seen him, to speak with him, since he was the happiest fellow of all the world; his loud, clear voice, resounding in the cold air, like a trumpet, as he parted from us the night of—of—the night of blood and ruin. I found that he occupied a room, in one of the wings, which, after some rambling, I found. There was somebody stirring within---some one breathing, as if his very heart would break. I knocked. No answer was returned; but the tread of naked feet, approached the door. It opened, and a woman stood before me. She put out her hands, kindly, and then started back, and covered her face with them—uttering a cry of horrour. `Merciful heaven!' I cried. `Lucia, dear Lucia, do not be alarmed---it is I. Where is Mr. Rodman's chamber? Forgive me, my dear friend, and compose yourself. You have not been in bed?' I turned to go; but she came to me, and put one hand to her forehead, and stood in the moonlight, like some disembodied creature, scared in its quiet element—looking at me, as if to ascertain if I had spoken the truth— `And this was really your object—really?' putting her hand affectionately, upon my arm. `Surely, dear Lucia, you cannot doubt it.' `O, no,' she added, `dropping her hand upon my shoulder—I cannot.' There was a distant step in the same gallery—she shook from head to foot—and, I— terrified to death at the thought of being seen there, stepped back, gently, and on tiptoe to my room—but startled, all the way, and particularly at one corner, by a sound, like the suppressed breathing of some one concealed. For a moment I stopped, with the resolation to see if it were a creature of flesh and blood, or only some delusion of my troubled brain, but recollecting immediately that, if it should be the former, my duty to Lucia rendered it a sacred matter that I should pass away, undetected, even in my innocence—for the most innocent action is capable of evil interpretation— I went on at the end of the gallery. I paused again—for a distant door opened and shut with a slow cautious motion—and a figure that, at first, from its muffled appearance, I took for my own shadow, (and only discovered it not to be so—by standing still for a moment)—passed athwart the white wall. Ashamed of my own feelings—for they were all in an uproar for a moment—with—I dare not utter the thought—the disordered dreaming of my brain—the late terrible events—the death like stillness of the dwelling where I was—the holy and awful moonlight above me—the figure of the person—I could not be mistaken,—but whither had it gone? As I stood, another door opened—and Arthur Rodman walked past me. I spoke to him—and he turned, with a slow, reluctant motion towards me—and then gave me his hand in silence. We went down into the court, and walked together, in a dead silence, for half an hour at least---his tread was measured, like that of men in a funeral march, and his breath labouring, deep, and drawn at long intervals. Occasionally, when we turned so that he was opposite the moon—and my countenance shadowed and hidden, I would lift my eyes to his. O, my children! far be from you and your's that sorrow and desolation, for which there is no comfort— that bereavement, that!—O righteous heaven, which leaves the smitten heart sore, to the centre, and bleeding, with no sweet memory to balm it!—no tears to fall upon it!—nothing but the substantial pressure of calamity. Poor Arthur—but a few days, and his step was a bound—his voice the filled horn—his heart the abiding place of gentle and high thought—festivity and love. A few days, and God had written, in lividness and shadow, the death of his loved one—the destruction of all his hope, upon his broad forehead. His hair blew about it, now—as if that too, had been touched with death—and his sunken eyes had a solemnity and blackness in them, that alarmed, and awed me—their motion was not unsettled—but there was a strong, rigid lustre in them, as if the fountain that fed them was nearly dry.—Poor Arthur!' said I, pressing his hand—`farewell.' His hand made no reply—. `O my brother!' I cried, looking him in the face— `My cousin—dear Arthur—you terrify me—speak to me---no; do not speak to me—the sound of your voice is terrible—but show me, by some sign, that you know me.—He stopped—his lips trembled—he locked my hand in both of his, and turned to go—but, overpowered by the deluge within him—which had gathered, till it would have way—he fell upon my neck—and I believe wept—for my dress was wet about the breast afterward, but whether with his tears or Lucia's, I know not—but I felt his heart heave like a surge under mine. Once more he shook my hand—long, and with all his strength, lifted his head in silence, and returned to his room, while I pursued my way to my own.—I found Clinton there, in low conversation with Archibald, and though, from some words that struck my ear, I thought that they were talking confidentially, and therefore, endeavoured to apprise them of my approach, by walking heavily; yet, so deeply were they engaged, that I was already at my own bed side, before they observed me. Clinton then gathered up his cloak about him. I started at the appearance of his muffled shadow—I felt my blood boil, but I dared not utter a sound. `Your brother has returned,' said Clinton, to him. `I am glad of it,' was the reply, `come to the bed, brother, I have something for your ear.' I approached, and he sat up in the bed—the collar of his shirt opened, and the fine fashion of his white shoulder and chest, all exposed—with a beauty and delicacy almost feminine, in their whiteness and smoothness. `Sit down brother; don't interrupt me. You have known something of my thought and doing, toward Lucia Arnauld. I have had some pleasant—some sorrowful dreaming—(his voice trembled)—and there have been times, when I thought of doing some noble and uncommon deed, for the love that I bore her. God only knows, brother, how I have loved her—so secretly, that I have not dared to tell it to my own heart—so passionately—so devoutly, that, with an opportunity for years to—to—to take advantage of her warm hearted, generous sensibility—I—' Clinton trembled, and turned away his face. `I have never dared to touch her hand, unless she put it into mine, until this night; and that was to bid her farewell, forever. Brother! it is hard to give her up —to tell the tale of our own disappointment—to have loved as I have, from my first breath, with an awful feeling of tenderness and veneration—it is hard—but to give her up so suddenly, to one that has known her so short a time—that is bitter—bitter!—but, young as I am, and beautiful as she is—it must be done. We are apart forever! Give me your hand, brother— your's Clinton. Another, a braver, and older man—a taller, and handsomer man—loves her—not as I have loved her—that is impossible. Would I stand in the way of her prosperity? No—I would rather, had I ten thousand hearts, throw them down, for her to walk over, to the arms of him that could make her happier. VOL. I. 10 I am young, and sickly, and weak—of an unsocial make—a blunt, cold manner—and a haughty, and forbidding countenance. I have never told my love— never talked about it—I could not—but there is that within me—that which will not bow nor bend. God hath put it there, and God only shall put it out. Woman never shall. How long I may live, I know not, and I care as little—but while I do live, and when I die, it shall be worthily—without complaint, or repining. He loves her, I know. Do not shake your head—I know it. He has dealt fairly—offered to renounce her—played the game of a soldier with me. What should I do? Fight him! No, that would not put my heart at rest, nor quiet her's: permit him to renounce her—take advantage of his noble nature? You are troubled, Clinton—agitated! Do not let me distress you. Now mark me—and you, brother, bear witness for me. I am not fond of quarrelling—or blood—am rather young, to be sure. But I can quarrel, Clinton—and can fight, as I have lately learnt. I am a man of few words—you are welcome to Lucia —take her, and be happy with her. Do that, and I will love you as a brother—her, as a sister—but— but—trifle with her—baffle her young heart---and, boy as I am, Clinton, I will never sleep, till I have put my sword through your heart. No remonstrance---I have done with her now. Happen what will, our hearts will never unite again. We are not fitted for each other---my nature is too stubborn and haughty--- too selfish, it may be. A wife of mine, shall be my wife, and mine alone.—There, brother---good night!---Clinton (shaking his hand) good night.' Clinton turned to depart, and had reached the door, when my brother arrested him, by asking when they should march. `Tomorrow, if possible,' was the reply, in an agitated voice, `but next day, at furthest.' `Why so,' said I. `Because,' he replied, `Washington is hotly pressed. Cornwallis, with the elite of the whole British army, is at his heels---our soldiers are dropping off, by companies, upon the march---the cursed effect of short enlistment. By the time that the rascals know one end of a musquet, from the other, they are cut adrift, and are sure to run off with the publick arms. `Tomorrow then, be it,' said my brother, `this is no time for delay.' `No!---for if Cornwallis follow him as closely to the Delaware, as he has through New Ark, we shall lose our baggage, if not our army, as sure as there is a God in heaven.' `Good night.' `Good night! good night!' repeated Clinton, formally, going back and shaking my brother's hand again, for nearly a minute, before he departed. I had half a mind to mention my suspicions---but a little reflection convinced me of the impolicy of it. What could I say?---that he was abused?---shame on my heart, for conceiving such a thought! Yet, I could not sleep---and, with the first dawn, I was in my father's room. He was abundantly better ---and when he found that we were set upon moving off, directly, he appeared doubly impatient to go with us. But Mr. Arnauld was not so well---the symptoms began to assume, if not an alarming, at least, a more serious aspect---and the bungling rascals from the army, were so wretchedly supplied with the instruments of their profession, that it was little better than certain death, to be pulled and hauled about by them, or lacerated, and sawed into, and cut, as the case might be. By reference to a report in congress, about this time, you will find that the medical infirmary, and surgical, and hospital staff, cannot be exaggerated. In the whole army, there were not three complete sets of surgical instruments. I have occasion to remember it well. It had well nigh cost me my life, at a later period, instead of the leg that I lost. `What shall be done?' said I, `some of our men ought to be left to protect the family. What say you, Clinton?' `Certainly,' he replied, `six or eight stout fellows--- and—' `What!' said Arnauld, raising his bandaged head, and firing with the passion of his heart, `what! leave six or eight of such fellows, to idleness, when every bone and sinew in America, should be in action! No, Clinton, no!---much as I love my wife and children--- dear as my household and home are to me, by heaven, I had rather see them given to the flames, than—' `And to ruffians,' said Clinton. `No, no, Clinton, a father's heart could not well bear that; but, away with you, away!—to horse! to horse! Oadley. You will protect my family best, by helping to drive back these hell hounds, that are over-running our blessed country. To horse! There are five men of us here, two of whom, Oadley and myself, can do garrison duty---or rather, hospital duty, (smiling) yet---and I expect a reinforcement every moment. Sampson, with his crooked boy, will be here this morning—a tough old blade; and a very devil, the young one—and if Nell come with them, as I expect, we shall have enough to keep us all in heart, and laugh, whatever happen. So, to horse!---to horse! man and boy! and leave us to take care of ourselves.' `Right,' said Clinton, `he is right, Mr. Oadley—if every man stays at home, to defend his own dwelling, who shall defend his country? We must take our chance, (with peculiar significance, as if he understood where my thoughts were, at the moment) our chance, Oadley, with the rest. To camp, to camp!—and we shall sooner clear the land of these devils, than if we huddle about our own hearths. They will always out number us at home. Ha!—the bugle call!' He ran to the window. `Fine fellows!—glorious fellows!' he cried—`the men are all in the saddle. Farewell, Mr. Arnauld—farewell!—keep a stout heart.' `Farewell, Colonel—farewell, Oadley—there, take my hand—remember—remember!—if any thing happen—you understand me—my family have few friends —my daughters, (he was scarcely articulate), none. They are proud girls, Clinton: high blood—generous hearts, Oadley. I don't reproach you. You have not done entirely right—but you could not deceive me; and there is a comfort here in—in—al— Young men, it is no pleasant matter, upon a bed like this; the sweat and blood starting from every pore of your skin, to have the thought of—of—rifled innocence —beauty—broken hearted—spoiled loveliness—and —O, God! have mercy upon me—but—no matter, now—it is too late—if I die—(more firmly)— if I die, I say, and you are the men—that—I believe, my family will never miss me—my daughters, I mean. My wife—O, my dear wife—' He could say no more—all his firmness abandoned him. The tears ran down his cheeks, drop after drop, as if wrung from his very heart—and when we embraced him again, the bed shook under him. The thought of his wife—the beautiful and pure of heart—that had left him powerless, and we dared not—no, we dared not utter a sound, to disturb the sacred stillness that followed—and we left the room; but his sobs were distinctly audible upon the landing, where I had stood the night before. We were passing the very spot, where I had heard the low suffered breathing—it was a recess, and still in shadow. I could not forbear lifting my eyes to Clinton's forehead, as we passed it; and it might be fancy, but it appeared to me, that there was a faint paleness, like that of one taken suddenly sick at the heart, upon his ample forehead, and that his arm contracted a little, within mine, as he met my look; yet he walked firmly—steadily—and there was a haughty, self possession, not very becoming at such a time of sorrow and tenderness, nor called for by the occasion—and rather, I hoped that I did not wrong him, rather like that of preparation, where one dares not abate one jot of his utmost stateliness, lest it may invite a freedom of observation, that might disturb it. We came to the landing. `I shall meet you, in the yard,' said he, taking out his watch. VOL. I. 10* I bowed, and hurried to the apartment of my father. Archibald, I found locked, in my mother's arms—my father sitting by, with the same unaltered, unalterable countenance—and she—wretched woman---weeping like some widowed one—nay, like some dishonoured widow—I— They were the first tears that I had seen her shed, openly; and when she came to me, I felt the inward lamentation of a mother, the inaudible, deep feeling of a woman, unable to utter a sound, against my bosom, like the rush of waters. `My son,' said she, `O my son!' pressing her cold lips to my forehead and eyes, which were all wet with her tears, `do not thou abandon me.' `Abandon thee, mother!—no, though the heaven should pass away. Come what will, I never will abandon thee!' `God bless thee! my child.' My father arose, and stood up; and laid one hand upon the shoulder of my mother, and one upon mine— they were the hands of a giant, and a prophet. `O, God! father of all mercies! have compassion upon us! We are old and sorrowful—and about, it may be, Oh, our father, to be childless. The parting that we now take, may be for life. Do thou sustain us.— Pour into the mother's heart, a ten fold consolation— stiffen the sinews of the father, and the husband, and make his children strong and terrible, that they may avenge their mother, though we perish. Farewell!— my boys!—farewell! The voice of your country is wailing for you!—the shriek of a dishonoured people —the cry of freedom!—the broken heart of your mother, about to give you up—that of your father, about to follow you. O, my wife—my wife! (my mother had fallen into his arms, speechless and death struck, as if that were all that was left to her—the presence of her aged husband.) Boys! embrace your mother, once more—you will probably never see her again. Do it with a stout heart—bear up against it, like men. Do not wake her---it may be better for her---much better--- if she never open her eyes again—.' We did as we were commanded---we knelt before her, and carried her lifeless hand to our eyes, and lips, and heart---unable to speak---unable to weep---took the blessing of our father, and were hurrying through the house, blinded and stunned by the rush of darkness and emotion---our arteries all distended to aching, with a strange, awful sorrow, like that of men going, voluntarily, to martyrdom---and sacrifice—. There was a carriage in the yard, out of which leaped in succession, a young boy, a savage looking distracted creature, as I ever saw in my life, with a spring like a panther; and stood, licking his hand and lip, with a tongue like a calf; then a finished romp, for she bounded, with her hair all flying in the wind, out of the carriage, without waiting for assistance, and ran, laughing and skipping, into the house—and then, a rigid, cholerick looking, little old gentleman, in a claret coloured coat, lame of one leg—growling at every step he took, in a low voice. At any other time, I should have smiled at the strangeness of the association, and their wild unnatural aspect—but this was no time for smiling. The men were all ready, and I turned to look for Archibald—but he was gone—and I, willing to find some companionship, followed in the direction that I supposed he had taken. I entered the house with a hurried step—and saw my father and Arthur parting— the young man still bearing the same implacable steadiness and solemnity of aspect—his dress and manner utterly unlike what it had been—thoughtful, yet careless, like that of a premature old man, suddenly put into possession of some fearful secret, the secret of his own hidden strength.—Voices were near me, and I stopped, as I was passing the window of the very room where a few weeks before, Archibald and I had seen the two sisters.—Lucia was leaning upon the shoulder of Clinton, pale, pale as death—but with a vehemence of passionate, bashful endearment that sent my blood back—with a start to my heart. I thought of Clara, and half distracted with the thought of never seeing her more—by any possibility—I went through room after room—heedless of every body, till at last, I found her, with her mother. She arose, as I entered, came to me, and put her two hands into mine:—her her mother looked at her with amazement—her lips moved—and she would have expressed her astonishment, even in her sorrow—but Clara turned to her, her bright eyes shedding not only light—but sound, it appeared to me like the indian gem, that give out beauty and brightness and low musick forever. `Mother!' said she, `the secret has been well kept, thanks to your admonition. I have done rightly. When you know all, you will approve of my conduct. At present, I am above all disguise—Mr. Oadley and I are about to part, perhaps, forever—I cannot bear to conceal it longer—I love him!' `Gracious heaven!' cried her mother, `are you distracted Clara!—at such a time as this!—a proud girl to—to—' (she covered her face with her hands, and burst into an hysterical sobbing). `Leave me, Mr. Oadley—farewell!—heaven bless you! You know something of my temper. What I do, I do openly. You must not presume from what has happened here. My mother may blame me—but my own heart shall not. Alone, away from my mother, who is weeping at my indelicacy, I should have parted with you less tenderly—now farewell!—' I would have put my lips to her forehead—but she coloured—`What!' she exclaimed, `have I to tell you again, Oadley, that there is no mystery in my nature There is my mother—while her face is covered, there shall be nothing done that is capable of an evil interpretation.' Her mother arose, and her hands fell at her side powerless—but her beautiful eyes were full of tenderness and surprise. `Clara,' said she—`it is my own fault. But I believed this affair at an end. The secret has been well kept. I love your noble nature—I respect it—the thing is sudden now, but he is an honest man.—God forever bless you!'—(putting our hands together, and kissing us as she did so). I lifted my eyes to Clara's face—her red lips trembled, but there was no reproof—no affectation—and though I would have given the world to touch her sweet mouth—yet I dared not, and contented myself with kissing her white forehead—. The next moment Archibald's tread was heard—he looked in, and beckoned to me. `Come in, come in, my dear Archibald!' said the mother—throwing her arms about his neck.—`O my poor boy—my heart would break, did I not know—but bear up, bear up, my brave fellow—there are few women worthy of such a man—.' Archibald gently released himself from her arms, wiped off the tears from his temples—and cheek—tears which had fallen from her eyes, in the embrace. `How pale you look! oh Archibald, Archibald, your own mother cannot love you more than I do—farewell! farewell!—I feel that I shall never see you again—remember however, happen what may, that I am your friend—that—will you not see Clara?' (Clara was standing at the window). `Yes,' said Archibald, bowing his head—`with all my heart—Clara,' (she gave him both her hands—there was a rush of blood to her temples—and her voice, always mellow, smooth and rich, like her father's—for a moment, was touched with the unsteady and passionate modulation of Lucia's)—`dear Clara—I have said and done many things, my dear friend, very many, to pain and distress you. Believe me, dear Clara, they were never unkindly meant, and I should have told you long before, that I was sorry and ashamed of them—but you know my temper (her eyes gushed out with beauty and brightness—the tears ran down her pale cheeks, as if her heart were breaking, and yet she stood upright, without concealment or shame—her red lips pressed together, with an expression of fervent and deep delight, homage, pride and admiration, as he continued—)— `I never loved talking—and had we never parted, in this way, but lived all our lives hereafter, as we have hitherto lived, I never should have told you—in words —how inestimably dear you are to me. Actions, actions, Clara—they would have shown it, in time; but farewell. My actions henceforth are afar off, and not among women—you may never hear of them—I therefore tell you, with my lips—what there is no other mode left of telling you; that there is one—nay two— come forward, my brother, who know your great value, your constant nature, and the deep sincerity of— Why, how is this—?—Do you understand each other? —you do—heaven be thanked!—Brother take her—be to her, what she deserves, the best and truest of men. Clara—that brother—you do not know him well yet—he does not know himself—he was not born for a sluggard—it is for you to say, whether he shall die one. I have studied him—I know him well---better, I believe, than any other person. He will always rise with the occasion. You may make of him, just what you please—.' I was thunderstruck—abashed—and Clara stood, with a proud smile upon her mouth. I had no leisure to hear or see more, for the sweet voiced Lucia was heard —as in deep conversation, near the door.---Archibald coloured—and so did Clara—but a mortal paleness followed in his face. `Can you not see her?—can you not—for one moment, Archibald?' said Clara, in a tone of expostulation. `No—' he replied, and then, as if a new thought had struck him, he added—`yes—I can—I will—it were a pity to part unkindly, for the last time.' `How, for the last time?' said the mother. `You speak as if you were resolved.' `I am:—you will hear no more of me, after I leave the house—except in one event.' `And what is that dear Archibald?' said Clara. He shook his head—but would not explain—but I had reason to believe that he alluded to a change of name---perhaps her marriage—or death---for after he had left the house, he announced his determination of entering the service by an assumed name. He continued—(while the bugle rang in the court yard, the horses neighed, and the voice of preparation sounded through all the apartments—like an army broken up in the house of prayer---so awfully hushed had it been, an hour before). `I am going to battle, Clara---not for fame---not altogether for vengeance, or hatred; nor for ambition, except it be the ambition of my own heart, for the deeds that I do, shall die with me—whatever they be: no---but I shall go into the thickest and hottest of it---I am sure, with a composure very uncommon in one so young and inexperienced.--- I shall do my duty Lucia, wherever I may be put— weak and boyish as I am—my thought will be steady —my hand firm, my eye true, in the commotion of battle—for that Lucia—that—pressing her hands upon his heart---will be nothing to the commotion here—.' `O, Archibald, I do pity---' said Clara.— `Not me, I hope'—(interrupting her.)— `No—but I pity her—.' `So do I,' said Archibald, `from my soul I pity her—the dear enthusiast.' `My heart misgives me, Archibald—there have been too much hurry, rashness, precipitation here—a brave man, an honourable one, I do believe—yet it is not wise or temperate.—What think you?—' `Clara—I cannot say that here, which I would not say to her face and his face.'---(A tear ran down under his shut eyelids---and he turned away). `Well Archibald---you, I know; my father knows you---my mother--Lucia---and whatever you may think, depend upon it, we shall always love and revere you. In distress we shall turn to you---in sorrow and in trial ---shall we turn to you, in vain?---ask you in vain?' `There was a convulsive heaving of his chest, as the mother came to him, and stood, side by side with Clara, watching the troubled beauty of his eyes, and the frightful lividness of his lips.—`You are young, Archibald, younger than your brother there; but when all other men fail us----all----all!—we shall turn to you, youthful as you are, sure of your power and strength—.' Why was I not hurt at this?---was it that I felt the truth of it?---or that the amazing honesty and openness of Clara---and the certainty that I possessed her whole heart, reconciled me to all other manifestations of love? —The mother bowed upon his neck---and he lifted his deep blue eyes to heaven---locked their hands in his, while, almost for the first time in all his life, the bright tears trickled down from his open eyes, with an expression of heroick joy. `Archibald,' said the mother, `I am afraid that you are not blameless in this matter---but it is too late now ---she is a proud girl, a proud impatient spirit---watch over her---be a brother too her---she may want a brother---Look to her.' `Wretched, mistaken woman!' said Clara---`How she has trifled with---' `Hush! hush!' said Archibald with unalterable solemnity. `I will never hear a movement of her heart condemned, in her absence. I may have my thoughts too-----thoughts that I may tell her----or keep here, here till it kill me---but I have that love for her and all that she loves, that inward unresistingness to whatever wears the blessed and pure countenance of love, that I cannot bear to hear it spoken lightly of.' `Well then farewell, farewell!' said the mother and daughter, `you must see her.' `But keep your eye on Clinton,' said Clara. `I will, night and day;' he replied, seizing my arm and hurrying me along, till I found that we were now approaching the same sound, of voices in earnest broken conversation. He tapped at a door, which was immediately opened by Clinton, who had risen from the sofa where Lucia sat, with a disordered, strange aspect; the apartment was exactly under that in which we had been, a fact which accounts for the sound of their voices appearing so near to us, in every interval of conversation. Clinton appeared a good dealed disturbed---and poor Lucia— there passed over her white forehead, white as the driven snow, a hurried emotion, but barely visible in the dim light of the apartment, every window of which was yet darkened---and objects could only be seen, after we were within, for a minute or two, by a pale crimson illumination, thrown by the blood red curtains, through which the day poured in, with a beautiful way wardness---a sort of voluptuous light, rather like that of a summer sunset, than a bleak wintry morning. `All ready?' said Clinton, hooking up his long sabre, that rattled at every motion of his body. `Yes, Sir,' said Archibald, `in ten minutes—ah! they are impatient'---(the bugle sounded again) `we are to be in the saddle. But before I go, I have taken my brother here, to bear witness for me---your patience.' He then went up to Lucia, who put her hand timidly, but haughtily too, into his, and attempted to rise. `No Lucia,' (standing before her, and holding it,) `do not rise. I ask for no such evidence of respect. I know that when I am gone, you will remember me in spite of yourself---the time may come, when you will find--(come hither Clinton---come nearer brother)---that you have been rash---it may come, I say---not that it will. God knows how fervently I pray for your happiness, and you will know it too, Lucia, when you are older and wiser. Not—no, it is impossible that you should ever know the full value of the heart that—nay Clinton, do not interrupt me, I deal plainly with her, I deal fairly. Surely, it is no unreasonable indulgence, for one consummately blessed, as you are, to permit one—so—I will not say so wretched or so humbled—but so disappointed—Clinton, by God!—I will not be interrupted (striking the hilt of his sword) and if you interfere again, man as you are—tall as you are, I will bring your forehead to the dust.' Clinton retreated a pace or two, tapped the hilt of his sabre, with his fingers—and smiled—damn him, I could hardly keep my own sword in its sheath—but VOL. I. 11 Archibald heeded him not—and continued, though Lucia sat like one terrour struck. `What I say now, is the last that I shall say—what I do, shall be done openly. I do not come to you, Lucia, lamenting that I have not been less cold, and cautious and rational—for I sought a woman for a wife—and no wife of mine shall ever be made speedily. I do not come to prejudice you against Clinton secretly—for I will do nothing that either he or you may misinterpret—or think unkindly of me, for, when I am gone. My honesty to both of you, at this moment, will be the best guarantee that I shall never profit of any advantage that may hereafter fall in my way, to poison either of your hearts against the other—No Lucia, no! But I came to say, with all my heart and soul, God bless you both! There Clinton, take her hand—and I do say, God bless you both! If you ever want a brother—a friend—an avenger Lucia, remember me. If you never do—if you are happy—blessing and blessed—forget me—you will be none the happier for remembering me. You have been imprudent—very imprudent—there is something in Clinton that I cannot bring myself to like—he is too easy and confident—has too much of that fascination—seductiveness, and self possession, with the young and beautiful—too much of that profligate manner, which has made your own father the destroyer of—forgive me, Lucia —I have spoken plainly—too plainly, if it were to be repeated—but I would say to you, beware; and I would leave a lesson upon your heart that should sink into it, deeper and deeper, to the last moment of its heaving. Be prudent—I anticipate no evil—I predict none—I pray for none—I appeal to my God, for the truth of what I say—and however you may both doubt me now, you shall see that I have spoken the truth, when all our hearts are uncovered before the judgment seat— farewell!—' She arose, parted her black hair with both hands, and stood looking at him, for a moment, as if struck with sudden blindness—then—carried his hand passionately to her lips—flung it away, and threw herself into the arms of Clinton. My brother could not stand that, with all his noble preparation. He staggered like a drunken, man to the door—rushed into the yard—and, ere twenty minutes had passed, Clinton and all of us were in full trot for the camp of Washington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. VIII. “The trumpet's dread hourra!” The stirring minstrelsy of the camp, the martial aspect of the mounted Virginians, whose brown, manly faces, athletick frames, and weather beaten furniture, showed plainly that they were men to be depended upon, and had been, ere then, put to the proof: the trampling of the horses; the pressure that I still felt about my bosom, whereon Clara had leant—the affectionate, strange Clara!—All these things, and the deep tumult within me, could not so utterly employ my senses, but that I would sometimes start, like a man waked from a dream, by the challenge of some distant sentry—the sudden pistol shot—the word—the rattling of cimetars and chains—or the quick trumpet blast—and almost wonder, for a moment, to find myself on horseback—and then, my mother!—father! But while I was pursuing this train of reflection, in a dead silence, like that of our last trooping, though the sun shone hotly upon us now, I heard the noise of horse's feet, pressing behind me; and the next moment, Clinton's voice—addressing some one, with a sort of sarcastick mockery. I turned, and saw him, just abreast of my brother, who slackened his trot, and fell behind, with him. I was alarmed for a moment, by hearing (for we had actually forgotten his situation, till then) him say, `You forgot that I was disabled in the sword arm.' `In truth, I did,' said Archibald, in a louder voice, rather of surprise---`but---you look angry, Clinton. Are you disposed to quarrel?' `Yes.' `Wait till your arm is well.' `Never mind the arm,' said Clinton, turning his horse aside. `We can ride into you wood, there. I am a tolerable shot, with my left hand.' My brother followed him, and I, indignant at such wickedness, struck the rowels into my beast, and was at their side in a moment. `What is the meaning of this?' said Clinton, imperiously. `Back to your place, Sir.' `This is my place,' I replied. He reined short about---looked me in the face a moment; and, then said, `Young man, I have half a mind to order a brace of Virginians down upon you. `What! do you menace me. Jasper! hollo! Jasper!' (Flourishing his sword with his left hand) The troop instantly halted, and down came a rank of horsemen---full gallop. `What do you mean to do?' said Archibald, eyeing him haughtily. `Order him to be bound, hand and foot, to one of the trees, there,' was the reply, `or hewed, limb from limb, where he sits.' `There will be two swords to that bargain, Clinton,' said Archibald, taking out his pistols, cooly. `Remember! we are not in service, yet. Brother, look to your pistols.' `Would you shoot a wounded man?' said Clinton, reining his horse. `Woa, Rocket, woa! Fire, if you dare!' `No---you are safe; but look ye, (taking a silver whistle from his pocket), `my men know the sound of this---we are too many for you. The first sword that is drawn, Clinton, in wrath, will bring every man down upon your Virginians. A pretty figure you would cut, then, would'nt you? before the commander in chief.' Clinton bit his lip; waved his sword for them to go back---they obeyed; and we followed slowly, after them. VOL. I. 11* `Archibald,' said he, `this is a damned foolish affair. Will you forgive me?---there is my hand. These cursed women are eternally in my porridge. I—' I reined up, expecting to hear the report of a pistol; but Archibald went by me, showing no sign of agitation, except a vigorous swelling of the nostrils, and a little more steadiness of eye. `I never was out on a foraging party, in my life--- curse it Rocket, stand still! can't you? Have you been among the idiots, too---hey!' Rocket leaped out, almost from under him; and Archibald I saw, with his hand---riding abreast of Clinton, nearly at a gallop—upon Rocket's mane. Their ill blood was not quite down, I saw, and therefore, I took the liberty to dash along side, too. `Hold in a moment,' said Archibald, through his shut teeth---`let the troop pass out of sight. Brother, leave us awhile.' `I will not,' said I. Archibald looked astonished; but, seeing that I was determined, he waited in a dead silence, till the last man had turned the road in our front, throwing his head round, as he did so. Archibald then wheeled short, and came up to Clinton, so that their horse's heads touched. `Well, gun-power, what's the matter now?' said Clinton, with a laugh, `you seem quite as ready for a shot, just at this moment, as I was ten minutes ago.' It was a minute before my brother could speak; and twice, before he uttered a sound, his hand was upon the holster—and twice, as if the wounded arm of Clinton had not been thought of, till he was ready to bring him from his horse, was it withdrawn. `Clinton!' said he, at last, `do not make me shoot you—upon the spot—hate you—curse you, and despise you—do not!' `Why what the devil is all this about!—a drivelling girl! Dam'me! when you have been in the army as long as I have, you will laugh at such Quixotism--- pho---pho. I love the wench---that's the truth on't---but, damn it, you are not in earnest, Oadley! Mr. Oadley! don't let him murder me!' I had just time to lay my hand upon Archibald's arm; when, struck himself at the peril of his own temper, he turned pale as death---took out his pistols, and discharged them at a tree. The bark flew at each shot, and Clinton changed colour---and well he might, for there was'nt such a marksman in the state. `Clinton,' said my brother, in a low voice, `I am unwilling to believe that you are a fool, or a scoundrel. I am trying hard, to persuade myself that this is all a sham. Tell me, Clinton, if you would'nt break my heart---tell me that you do love her.' `Love her!' cried Clinton, touched by his manner, till his feet shook in the stirrups—`Yes! I do love her, Archibald, more than all the women upon earth—more than I ever thought that I was capable of loving any woman on earth—any thing.' `Thank you,' said Archibald, `but—' `Any thing but Rocket, I mean,' said the incorrigible Clinton. I was obliged to speak. `This levity, Colonel,' said I, `to say the least of it, considering my brother's situation and mine, in regard to that family, is neither thoughtful nor generous—(his eye kindled)—but I have no disposition to quarrel with you. I am principled against duelling, and prefer spilling my blood, and seeing your's spilt, for our common country, and—' `Mighty fine, Mr. Oadley; but I shall find a time—' `When you please!' said my brother, striking his hand upon his thigh, and looking up in his face. `Country or no country—when you please!—where you please!—how you please. Across a table—left handed.' Clinton stopped a moment for the troop, it appeared; had halted again upon a rising ground, where they could see our movement, and their's seemed to indicate that they had discovered some signs of hostility in our countenance, or deportment; for they separated, while we were looking upon them, man after man, until they occupied two different and distinct pieces of ground—our men on one, and the Virginians on the other, facing—partially inclined to the direction where we were—as if, but a word, and they would have galloped, sword in hand, upon us—or upon each other. `Not now,' said Clinton, `not now—blood will be spilt, if we waste any more time. Give me your hand, Archibald—your's Oadley. Mark me—I hold you both answerable to me—and myself, to both—but let us do our duty, first, to Washington.' The proposal was accepted, and on we rode, in a sullen, terrible silence; until at last, my horse reared with the sound of Clinton's loud voice, and unaffected laughter. `Come, come, Archibald,' said Clinton, `no more of this—we have carried the matter far enough.' Archibald contracted his forehead, and replied, nearly in these very words; for they made a strange impression on me, being delivered with a cool, deliberate expression of sagacity, as if his whole opinion of Clinton had changed—and could never be changed back again:— `Colonel Clinton, I can bear to lose her—bear to see her wrested from me, after a three weeks acquaintance, by a stranger; but I cannot bear to hear her affectionate, noble nature, treated irreverently. No man that ever knew her worth—no man that was ever worthy of her, could do it. Pshaw—do not menace me, Clinton. There is not that man alive; there never was—whom I would permit to speak lightly of Lucia Arnauld.' `You are certainly under some mysterious obligation to her, Sir. I—' `Your sneering, Clinton, does'nt disturb me—if it be true, as you think it is, that I have loved her, even unto death, and been put aside for you, that does not, and shall not give you a title to make one profligate allusion to her. I am no longer her lover. Ride slower, if you wish to hear me through—it is the last time that I shall name her name to you. I shall never be her husband; but I am a brother—and as her brother, Sir, whatever she may wish or say, I shall hold you answerable for every word and deed, said or done, in relation to her. You are amazed, to hear a boy talk in this way. Sir, men have grown old in a single day —grey headed, in a single night—very wise, in a single hour. Attribute all that you see strange in me, to what has passed within the last forty-eight hours. In that time, I have lived an age of agony and horrour —passion and disappointment—sorrow and humiliation. She that I loved, has abandoned me—he that I would have died for, speaks of a woman, whose very name, if he knew her, with all her frailty and infirmity, he could not pronounce aloud, for his life— speaks of her, as if she were the bireling wanton of a camp—some polluted creature—the abused strumpet of a whole army. I do not ask if this were pleasantry—for if it were, it would make me tremble and weep for her. Men that love truly, can no more trifle in that way, with the sacred and beautiful, and tender relationship of love, than they could stand and assist in dishonouring their own mother. But it is not true, Clinton. It was not pleasantry—it was no premeditated contrivance—it was the expression of habitual profligacy—a constitutional and settled irreverence for women—an utter incapability of loving—except as a sensualist, or voluptuary. So, no more of that—here let us part. I shall take care, with my own hands, to inform Lucia of this conversation— she may then judge for herself. You appear disturbed—I am glad of it. I would fain see you moved, Clinton, to tears—that might be some expiation for the outrage that you have done—not to me—not to Lucia—but to the sequestered, timid, and holy image of Lucia that I bear in my heart. You were never worthy of her, Clinton—you never will be. I have been deceived in you—I have assisted in deceiving her. But, as I am a living man, it shall not be my fault if she be not undeceived! You need'nt smile! Archibald Oadley yet has a place in her heart, to which your image will never penetrate—never!—It is the best, and the least visited spot there—and when she dies, my name will be found there. I could have told her this—but I feared, mistaken boy that I was, to thwart her pleasant dreaming with you. Farewell, Clinton. With my consent, we shall never meet again. I shall do my duty—nay, I understand you—but I have thought better of it. Whatever you may think of my courage, I will never meet you, for any thing that has yet taken place between us, until your arm is well— and our country has no further need of us. Not then, Clinton—not even then—whatever you may do to provoke me—if you should be the husband of Lucia— the—the—father of her child—that smile! O God, Clinton! is not the very thought of being the father of children, borne by Lucia, enough to purify your whole nature?—if not—heaven have mercy upon you!' His voice was inarticulate with emotion—and whatever Clinton may have thought, I am sure that he felt awe struck, in the presence of the intreped boy. Soon after, we joined the troop; and, about an hour before sunset, fell in with the advance of Washington's army. Signals and salutes were exchanged; and a general hourra was uttered, at the sight of Clinton, (yet the name that they hailed him by, was not Clinton—though I shall continue to call him so.) and his noble horse pranced, and stamped about, as if impatient to rush anew into the battle. `Halt!' cried Clinton, putting his horse at speed. `To your place, Captain Oadley—that is the baggage, coming ahead. We shall meet the commander in chief, in half an hour.' `Yes Sir,' said an officer, facing about, `he is with the rear guard; and Cornwallis' advance is constantly engaged with it—(and off he set at full speed.) `We must cross the Delaware, to night, orall is lost!' `Masterly! by heaven,' said Clinton, his noble face blazing outright, at the noise of the distant musquetry and drums—Jasper, he has kept him at bay for ten days.' Our horses grew impatient; but we were soon relieved, for a young fellow rode up, his horse all covered with foam and sweat, made his salute without stopping, said a single word to Clinton, who gave the word to gallop, and then set off, toward the sound. We followed; but as our course was on the side of the road, for the whole centre was taken up with wagons, artillery, baggage, and the hospital stores—(including sick and wounded) we could not go beyond a slow trot. `Hourra! for Washington!' cried Clayton, rising in his stirrup, `that's his trumpet!—I should know it among a thousand.' My blood thrilled at the sound—my brother fell back, inconceivably agitated, to where I was—and Arthur, his horse keeping time proudly, to the cheerful roundelay of the trumpet—came upon my left, so that we occupied, precisely, our old relation to each other. A trampling of horse was now heard—a solemn stillness followed—and at the end of about five minutes, Washington appeared, a little in advance of several young officers, superbly mounted—upon a magnificent white charger, whose hoofs rang, when they struck the frozen ground, like the blow of a battle axe. I heard Archibald catch his breath—and saw his head droop as Washington approached, with Clinton at his side, in earnest conversation. They rode directly up to my brother—who, whatever might be his thought, for I looked for something terrible—had the presence of mind to sit suddenly erect in his saddle, fasten his keen eye upon the eye of Washington—and make his salute—in a manner that made the whole line of horses start back. It was beautifully—gracefully—done; and Clinton, I could perceive, was proud of it. `Captain Oadley,' said Washington, to me, in a voice that made my heart sink within me—I attempted to stammer out some reply—but I could not. `No, your Excellency,' said Clinton, spurring to his side, `that is Captain Oadley,” pointing to Archibald. `Indeed!' was the only reply, after a pause in which you might have counted twenty—while the commander in chief, with that sublime stately serenity, which is to be seen even now in the picture of Stuart, although taken at a much later period—turned his large steady eyes upon my brother, till I thought that he would have fallen from his horse—abashed and overpowered with veneration. `So very young! Colonel Clinton, you will put them upon duty to night—we have no time for refreshment— and tomorrow, bring Captain Oadley to me—' Saying this, he put his handsome horse into a slow gallop, and passed on. `Captain Oadley,' said Clinton, dropping behind, and assuming all at once, the air of command, best fitted to his countenance, the occasion, and the place—he sat his horse royally indeed—and the superb uniform which he wore laced athwart the breast, gave all the properties of his full chest, and broad square shoulders to the eye—`you will keep your men upon the wing younder,' pointing to the right—`take what prisoners you can, without hazard; cut down every straggler and deserter without mercy, and give notice of all that drop from fatigue.' Captain Oadley made the salute, as if he had never seen his face before, gave his orders, and immediately took his position, scouring the plain ground, far and near, till past eleven o'clock that night—having been nearly twelve hours in the saddle. Our army was now in full retreat to Princeton, having left Newark, and Brunswick, before Cornwallis with a light body of picked men, amounting to more than double the number of ours; and so hotly pressed was Washington by the unexpected vigour of the enemy, just at the time when he was supposed to have gone into winter quarters—and the term of enlistment was expiring with our troops, that the van of the enemy sucessively entered New Ark, Brunswick, Princeton and Trenton, while the rear of our army was leaving each place. But at last, blessed be God! we left the banks of the Delaware, at twelve o'clock at night, just as his van appeared upon them. My children! I must pause. I would have you realize the tremendous peril in which your father and uncle—all his family and friends—nay! all the hopes of America were placed at this hour. Cornwallis was dashing after us, with all his strength and zeal, at the head of six thousand men: and every man that we could count made only twenty-two hundred, on the day that we crossed the Delaware! Nay, in a few days after, we were reduced to about fourteen hundred and fifty! Think of this—a broad river in our front—scarcely men and horses enough to drag our military stores—no possibility of resistance, or retreat—the whole country struck with terrour, and silence. What would have become of us, had we been overtaken, but a single hour, before we embarked? God only knows—but it is my belief that we should have been, at this moment, with the gallant men of Ireland, the vassals of England, the hewers of wood and the drawers of water, to a patrician rabble, and a profligate king. But why was not Washington pursued further? The shores of the Delaware were encumbered with materials for the construction of rafts and platforms—and he, himself, in a letter to Congress, declared that nothing but the infatuation of the enemy saved him. Some have pretended to say, that Sir William Howe was not seriously disposed to destroy Washington—but the truth probably is, that he was a cautious commander, knew not the strength of our army—or rather its weakness, and was unwilling to cross a broad and rapid river, with a division that could could not be readily supported, if Washington should turn upon it, supported by a general rising of the country. Sir William Howe has been blamed for his circumspection—Burgoyne for his impetuosity—Cornwallis, for one can hardly tell what—any thing in short that would exhonerate his country from the disgrace of being beaten, by men, who wanted only to be slaves, to be the best troops upon the earth. VOL. I. 12 Yet, after all, there was something inexplicable, not only in the movements of General Howe, and Lord Cornwallis, but in those of Washington at this time:— for the former, but for the destruction of a little bridge over the Raritan, would certainly have taken our baggage—and when the latter did not move from Princeton until Cornwallis was within three miles of it. yet, Cornwallis consumed seventeen hours there!—actually sleeping on the way—before he advanced upon Trenton, which is only twelve miles distant. There is only one way of accounting for this. Cornwallis must have had positive orders, and Washington must have known it— or, becoming careless and desperate of the result, which is possible even in Washington, he loitered upon the road—and the enemy, taking it for a stratagem, were intimidated into extreme precaution. Soon after this, General Lee was captured—and Congress abandoned Philadelphia. It was a general season of darkness and dismay, but—let me not anticipate. Place yourselves with us in the boats, my children; imagine that you see Archibald and myself holding our horses by the head, with one foot upon the gunwale, looking into the black deep water—the enemy just coming in sight—flash after flash—shot after shot, sent after us—with a loud word or too—in laugh and scorn— from the enemy; and now and then a horseman dashing, at full speed, along the bank, before the torches.—It was a magnificent night, but very dark—except in a part of the heavens which were all on fire with a storm just rising.—The opposite bank, we found in possession of a small body that had been thrown over in advance, but such was our timidity for a while, that, when some fellow shouted—`the enemy!'—we were all thrown into disorder for a moment, without reflecting on the impossibility of such a thing. There was a strange, cold hurry of my blood, when the water, and foam of the horses at windward, as they fretted upon their bits, and shook their wet manes in the wind, blew in my face. And when I landed, wet through,—and chilled and stiffened in all my limbs, I cannot deny that somewhat of the generous enthusiasm for liberty, which I had felt, appeared extinct within me. Ours was the third or fourth boat—and I recognized Washington immediately—and he, my brother; for he rode down, directing him to form upon the right, saying as he did so—`I have heard of your good conduct, young man. You have joined a sinking, but not a desperate cause; and I am sure that the brave men with you will live to experience the effect of their example. Remember me to every individual, at your leisure, and give me a list of their names. Where so many are leaving me, the country ought to know who are coming in.' `By all the stars of heaven!' cried my brother, flourishing his light weapon in the wind, as Washington rode off—`How a few words, from such a man as that, can agitate a human heart!—brother! I am no longer a boy—no longer weak—Washington has spoken with me, face to face!—and hereafter, mark me, I give way to no man upon this earth!' I was carried away with his enthusiasm; and, now, being safe from pursuit, we were thrown off, into a separate covering party, while the Virginians, saluting us as they passed, with something more than a military feeling—for had'nt we been in battle together?—filed off in a contrary direction to join their companions—. The next morning, at an early hour, Clinton joined us, still with the air of a superiour in command, and addressing my brother, who was smoothing the mane of his beautiful mare, said to him— `The Commander in Chief has confirmed your appointment, Sir; and permitted you to select one hundred men for a while;—hereafter, they will be reduced --at present, they are too numerous for your command-- you have the liberty of naming your own officers.' `My men shall choose for themselves,' said Archibald. `No Sir, that will not be permitted---the service has been too long the sport of that shameful practice. It leads to indulgence, carelessness, and neglect of duty--- whom would you name?' `Arthur Rodman,' said my brother, bowing, `and Jonathan Oadley,—and whom you please for the rest.' `Your recommendation will be attended to,' said Clinton, facing his horse—`but I would have you know, gentlemen, that the eye of the general is upon you. He expects the greatest vigilance and severest discipline. You are now in service, and subject to martial law.' There was something sarcastick in the tone, with which this was said, as if meant to irritate; but my brother took no notice of it—observing only—after he had gone— `His manners mend apace brother—but that arm of his seems wonderfully improved in camp'—(I had observed that it was no longer in the sling)—`Do you know the surgeon that attends him?' `No,' I replied, `he came very opportunely to the house—and I believe had been in service.' `Did you ever see the arm?—were you ever by, at a dressing?'--`No—but I remember hearing Mr. Arnauld say to him, that his movements were wonderfully easy, for a broken limb. `I do not believe that it was broken—' said Archibald—`It was bruised, and perhaps dislocated —for I know that the wrist was terribly swollen—but my notion is that it will be soon well.' `So be it,' said I—`the sooner the better.' We understood each other, and shook hands upon it. In this manner with some little alterations of incident, and command, several days had passed, during which short time, our spirited little troop, out early and late, upon hazardous and fatiguing, if not dangerous service, began to attract the admiration of the General's Staff:—La Fayette, in particular, then in the prime and beauty of manhood, full six feet high, riding a dark bay horse, of superb carriage, frequently passed by us at our exercise, and threw in a word or two of incitement to my brother, which fired his very heart. `I told you,' said I, when he had left us one day, after addressing him, with that princely air, which yet characterises the ancient nobility of France—`I told you that you would never be able to pass off under an assumed name.' `No,' he replied—`I had not reflected upon it then—a little timely precaution before we met the Virginians, might have done it—but, it was a vain thought after all: —a secret cannot be well kept by one hundred. I have abandoned it. Let our old father have the comfort of it.' `It is said to have been a masterly retreat,' added my brother—`this, of our commander through the Jerseys. I just heard that rough, honest, weather beaten man (pointing to General Knox) and that tall one there ---with the fiery grey eyes, (pointing to General Cadwallader)---in conversation, as they halted at the left of our troop, say that it beat Xenophon's retreat, all hollow---and that nineteen days had been consumed on it.' `Wonderful!' said I---hardly knowing why so---except that other men called it wonderful, whose judgement and truth were authority with me. `The country have taken the alarm too,' said my brother, `they came pouring in, on all sides---and the talk is of a speedy battle, if we can get enough about us to make a stand. Let us be prepared—Arthur I find, is melancholy as ever—does he sleep at all?' `Very little,' I answered---`wake when I will, he is always lying in the same position, with his eyes half shut---in the saddle too, night and day.' `So much the better,' said my brother---`Jasper says that my troop are better horsemen, in all but running at the ring, than any troop of cavalry in the service--- and I---' `Do you improve?' `Yes---I am more than a match for him now—he confesses it himself. A French gentleman here---that thin, sprightly fellow that you saw talking awhile ago with the Marquis—' `La Fayette:—' `Yes---he has promised to teach me small sword: he says that Clinton is the best man in the army at that.-- But---patience---patience brother---a small sword is a VOL. I. 12* safer weapon than a pistol;---worth accomplishing myself in; and I am determined to be first, or nothing.— I have played three or four hours a day, and my master predicts wonders.' The British troops were thrown into cantonments, extending all along from Brunswick to the Delaware, and presenting a front toward Philadelphia. This began to agitate our Commander, till he could neither eat nor sleep. We could perceive that his manner was more solemn and thoughtful than ever; and one day, when I was detailed upon duty, and paraded in front of his quarters, I remember that, as he came out, there was a handsome, florid looking young man, named Wilkinson (since then General, then Major)— with him, on whom the eyes of Washington were turned, with an expression of mournful, but intensely deep resolution. Wilkinson appeared a good deal affected, and as he passed me, walking with his sword—he had the air of one, who was willing to have it known that he had been dining with the General in Chief. His eyes were full to overflowing. `Now then to clip their wings! while they are so extended,' said Washington, to the poor boy who brought an account of the enemy's situation and numbers, Jemmy Rice, the ideot, as he was called—and soon after, a blow was struck that startled all America from her sleep—like the trumpet of resurrection. It was about this time that a damp had fallen upon the very heart of our people, by the capture of Lee. He had been an universal favourite—his talents abundantly overated—his achievements at the south, magnified beyond all belief—and all his faults—his domineering, arrogant pretensions, forgotten or forgiven—and, some how or other, the people took it into their wise heads that he had suffered himself to be surprised, as the handsomest way of abandoning a desperate cause. They were mistaken—Lee was surprised; and had no good reason to wish himself out of our hands, or in the hands of the British, for, he and Lord Stirling, were, for a long time, kept in confinement as rebels—and traitors, rather than prisoners of war. But more than that, his capture was providential, in the extreme. Look at his position, upon the map. See where he was taken— entirely out of his line of march. No—if the truth must be told, it is this—Charles Lee was willing to sacrifice Washington to his popularity. He loitered upon the road, and went aside from it, under the idlest pretence, at the time when Washington was vehemently pressing him for succour—with no other object, or at least, it is difficult to imagine any other, than to strike out some such brilliant coup de main, upon the extended out posts of the enemy, as Washington then meditated, and afterwards performed upon Trenton. And had he succeeded!—merciful heaven!—my blood curdles at the thought—he would have been in the place of George Washington, commander in chief of our armies—and the Cæsar of America. But, let me return. Just before the battle of Trenton, of a most beautiful evening, while we were walking in front of our troop, that had been out on a fatigue party through our cantonments, along the Delaware, there was a fine, martial looking young man, halted near us; accompanied by another, of a stouter, more substantial, and farmer-like aspect; one of whom we found to be Colonel Reid, and the other, old Put, or General Putnam. `Well primed!' said Put, `well primed!' (returning a large rusty horse pistol to the holsters.) `Reid, we are in troubled times—I would'nt sleep without a cocked pistol in my hand. Dark times, dark times, Reid.' `The darkest time of night,' said Reid, `is just before day, general.' `Ha!—by heaven and earth,' cried my brother, dropping my arm, `there goes our father!' He was right—the old man had come at last—stout and terrible as ever, passing, with the indifference of a veteran, through all the paraphernalia of war—with fifty nine horsemen, and nearly two hundred foot, at his heels. Washington mounted, and rode down to receive him—and gave the old man his hand, before all the soldiers. There was our reward!—there it was!—who would'nt have spilt blood for his country, to see the hand of his old father so taken, at the head of a whole army! The old man bowed his grey head upon the general's hand, and I could see that his knees trembled—and his eyes were nearly shut, and quenched, when he lifted them. A word or two passed between them, when the general pointed to Archibald, who stood patiently waiting the issue—and then rode off. Our father got leisurely from his horse—embraced us affectionately—told us that all were well—all— spoke of Clinton, and Lucia. I was amazed at my brother's self possession. He showed no weakness— no emotion, at the name. My father bore a letter for Clinton, which was sent to his quarters, but not an hour had passed, before a messenger came with orders for Captain Oadley. I arose to accompany him. `At your peril,' said the messenger. `I am ordered to keep my eyes upon you. He must go alone.' `Tell your master, Sir, that I shall not go alone. If Colonel Clinton would see me, he must come to my quarters; or wait till I am under his command.' `That's my noble boy,' said my father, `but—hey? —how's this?—you look pale, Archy. Can't you forgive him yet?—pho, pho—never mind the girl— she—' `Hush, father. I can bear any thing, but that!' They then walked away, till the canvas was rudely thrust aside, and Clinton stood before us—his eyes sparkling with rage—his lips bloody. `Is that your work, Sir?' said he, to Archibald, throwing down a letter. My brother smiled darkly, but took it up, without any sign of trepidation. keeping his eye upon him for a while, and then running it over the page. `Yes Sir, it is,' said he. `And how dared you?' `Dared!—O, it was no such daring matter. I told you that I should do it, and I always do what I promise.' `Fool—mad man!' `Colonel Clinton, these are my quarters. I should be loath to strike you, my superiour officer—but—' Here Clinton's eyes fell upon my father—and his manner instantly changed, to the same careless, unthinking levity, that he wore when we first knew him —captivating all hearts, yet confounding them at the same time, by the violence and suddenness of its transitions. Archibald went a step nearer, as if distrusting his own eyes. `Damn it, Oadley,' dashing the back of his hand over his eyes, I don't half like this affair. I have been very like a villain—and—will you give me your hand, and forget what has past.' `No,' said my brother—`no. When Colonel Clinton has explained two or three little matters—reformed in two or three, not very important particulars —repented, deeply and truly, of two or three matters of no moment—if he want a friend, here stands one that will be his friend—his friend indeed. Till then, never.' Clinton looked disturbed; but finally, the natural wild levity of his character, prevailed. `Done!--I subscribe to your terms—I will be what you desire, my little chaplain. I—' Archibald looked, and I felt, deeply offended. He felt that he was no longer a boy, and he would not be treated as a boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “By torch and trumpet fast arrayed, “Each horseman drew his battle blade; “And furious, every charger neighed, “To join the dreadful revelry!” `We shall keep our Christmas in a serious way, father,' said I, in answer to some remark of his, the evening of his arrival, respecting the preparation in our neighbourhood. `No more so, than they will,' answered the old man, passing his hand athwart his eyes. `This will be the first one for, twenty-six years, that your mother and I, have passed away from each other; or abroad from our own roof. God help the aged, who, in the dead of winter, are driven asunder, as we are!—The winter of the year plays bitterly upon them that are exposed, in the winter of the heart, for the first time, under such a miserable contrivance as this'—(The snow was blowing through the rent canvass, at the moment, and sprinkling the table, upon which my brother lay, with his arm stretched out, and his face lying upon them, as if spent and overpowered with fatigue)—for the first time in their old age. It is no merry Christmas to them.' `Nor will it be to the enemy, I'm a thinking, father,' said Archibald, lifting his head for a moment. The traces of weeping were yet upon his eyes—and a quick confusion passed over his face, as he saw our eyes glancing, where the moisture and breath of his wet lips had frozen upon the table; and the tears had fallen like rain, and dashed his arm athwart the whole, exclaiming, `if we are to remain here much longer, we shall be weather proof indeed.' `What mean you, Archibald?' said my father to him. `Your countenance was fuller of expression than common—are the enemy in any peril?' `Hush, father—we are not permitted to talk aloud of such things. All that I can tell you is, that a double portion of rum has been issued to the soldiers—several days provision ordered to be kept constantly cooked— all the surgeons kept busy, in preparing their instruments and bandages—and that, something, I know not what—or if I did, I would not breathe it, is in agitation. Let us be prepared then—at a moment's warning. I have not taken off my clothes, for these six nights; and the saddle has almost grown to Hetty's back. And besides—I can tell you further, that Washington has not shut his eyes, for the last forty-eight hours. I saw him, at three o'clock yesterday morning, pacing the hard ground, in the rear of his quarters, for an hour together. Council after council has been called, at which only two or three of his most intimate and confidential officers have been admitted. So let us be prepared. Whatever it is, I feel assured, from the bearing of our commander, that it is a desperate matter. Let us be on the alert— silent as death, and prompt as the angels of death.' `Amen!' said the old man, putting his hand upon Archibald's head. `Verily, verily, thou art the child of my old age!' I was startled at the sudden reply of Archibald. There was a peevishness and impatience in it—and he talked with that hurried earnestness, which is common with them, that talk to drown their own thought. I wondered at it. I had wondered too, at the strange communicativeness that he had just manifested, and began to study him with more attention, to discover, if possible, what it was, that so wrought upon him. `You are disturbed,' said I, at last. `What has happened to you?' He lifted his deep, beautiful, intelligent eyes, upon me—attempted to speak—dropped the lids, two or three times, and opened and shut his lips, with that dry, peevish expression, which shews the unquiet nature of the spirit within, more forcibly than any words —and then, as if ashamed of his own weakness, stooped to the floor, or rather to the trodden earth, for we had no other floor, and picked up a letter, which he pushed toward me, and then turning suddenly to my father, while I began to read it, asked him how Mr. Arnauld was. `Bad enough, poor gentleman.' `Not dangerous, I hope.' `No—we hope not; but his hurts have been followed by a fever and derangement, during which he raved incessantly of Mary Austin. Don't frown, Archibald; the hand of God hath fallen heavily upon him—but his proud spirit is humbled to the earth. If ever mortal man was truly and deeply penitent, sorrowing, ashamed and submissive, Robert Arnauld is so—and when I left him, sick and sore as he was—bereaved and darkened as they all were, I have good reason to trust that they were all happier with him, and prouder of him than ever.' `And my mother?—' said Archibald choking— `There is no consolation for her, boy—earthly consolation I mean. She is going to her grave; and I am prepared to go with her. May it be God's will that we shall sleep together, in the same grave!—our bridal, and marriage, and death should be the same.—I could pray to die first, and away from her—but that would be unnatural—selfish. I am better able still than she, to withstand the wintry desolation of survivorship. Her heart is sick and sore yet—even unto death.' `Let it not be agitated then,' said Archibald,—`for that would be a death to it now, perhaps, which at another day, it would resist for ever—' (pressing his own hand upon his own heart, with all his strength)—`well brother, you have finished, I see—what think you of it.' I shook my head— `Mistaken girl!' said Archibald, `how little she knows her own heart.' `Read that,' said I—giving him a letter that my proud Clara had written me. It was as follows. `We had hoped, dear Oadley, to see you for a few hours, at Christmas; and, sad as the prospect is, we shall not give up the hope, until the night has passed. We feel, it is true, when we hear of your movements, for in one way and another, while you are near us, we seem to hear of every thing that is done by our little army—we feel strangely, as the thought comes over us, that near as you are, you cannot be with us—sick or well, living or dead, without the permission of others that never heard of, or care for us. I have no time to write more; your father goes sooner, by three days, than he had meditated—in consequence, though he will not own it, of a dream that a little mad cap here had, respecting him—and his reinforcement. My dear father, blessed be heaven, is in the way of restoration—but—you cannot well imagine my delight and gratitude—his heart is not the heart that he fell sick with. Our Heavenly Father hath touched and purified it.—Your mother has consented to sit with the family, now, and we hope to make her feel more comfortable after a while.' `Ellen Sampson, who arrived just as you were setting out, and caught a glimpse of Rodman and your brother, is strangely infatuated about him. She is the life of the whole family, and vows that, solemn and strange as he is—and wild and frolicksome as she is— he shall be her true knight, and bids you tell him so, sending a lock of her bright hair for an amulet.' `Here it is brother,' (offering it to him.) `Pho, pho!—read on,' said Archibald, without looking at it—`read on, what says she of—of— I lifted my eyes to shew him that I understood of whom he would inquire, and glancing at my father, whose loud breathing announced that he had fallen asleep— while Archibald threw off his watch cloak, covered him with it, and sat by his side so as to support his head upon his bosom—I read as follows— VOL. I. 13 `Remember me to Mr. Rodman, who, we are told, as well as yourself (bad English, but I cannot help it, in the hurry of my feeling) is an officer—and tell him that the stout hearted never despair—that it is unmanly to be stricken to the heart, by any sorrow, any calamity, any humiliation—tell him that a woman says so— and bid him awake, stand up, bare his forehead to the sky, and shake off the fetters that encumber him.— His Maker will not hold him guiltless of his own blood, if he rashly, presumptuously, or with a feeling of despondency, let it out, no matter in what cause.' `And now, as for you, dear John—allow me to address you so—it is an endearing appellation—and may be a comfort to you, if any thing should hereafter happen to sunder us—' `To what,' said Archibald—starting— `To sunder us!” `She writes very composedly—' said he, in reply, with a sort of bitter pleasantry—`as if such an event were in her contemplation, but proceed—' `I never used it to mortal man except to you—I have reserved it to this moment. I have been thinking much of you since you left us, and I have come to the conclusion, impelled to the enquiry perhaps by what Archibald said, when we parted, that we have all misunderstood your true character—that, sedate and quiet as you are—you have a slumbering earthquake in your breast.—Beware of it, in time. Things lightly done, with such a temper—may convulse and shatter the whole constitution of your happiness. I may be mistaken, but my belief is, that, once put to it—your temper will be most terrible, more implacable and tempestuous: your wrath, fiercer than that of any creature about us-Beware of it. No fitting occasion has yet happened for the developement of your power—I almost pray that one never may happen—for I tremble, when I think what else may start up with it.—And now—let me tell you, that when we meet again, I have something, for your private ear—a matter of little importance, I endeavour to persuade myself—but possibly, of sufficient to—no, I will not frighten myself with such anticipations. I allude to it now, that, if your own heart smite you, you may be prepared against our next meeting; and that you may not attribute the kindness of my manner in this letter, to ignorance—but rather to an unshaken principle of my nature, which leads me never to withdraw my confidence, in any degree, from the heart where it has once been placed, without proof—proof like holy writ. Whatever it be therefore, dear, dear John—let not your heart be disturbed, unless you are deliberately guilty. Then—it may be—we might as well never meet again. But if innocent altogether—or in a degree—or only surprised into that, which manhood and delicacy made you conceal from me—you may be sure of my forgiveness, blessing, and perhaps, of my unalterable affection. Meantime, you may be assured that there will be no change in my deportment toward you, till I see you confronted, face to face, with your accuser, and if—for O, my friend—in the peril of war and the vicissitude of chance and life—such a thing may well be—and it is our duty to be prepared for it—if it be, that we are never to meet again—never!—let this consolation abide with you, that I shall hold you innocent, and love you, venerate you, as so, until you are proved to be guilty—face to face!' `Christmas is at hand: we have agreed to leave a vacant seat, for each of you—yet—O! merciful heaven! my heart hurries and stops at the thought—my assumed calmness all deserts me—apprehension and darkness rush in upon me, and my tears will fall, in spite of all my strength and preparation—Yet—who can tell but that seat may never be filled again!—You— or your father, or Archibald, or Arthur, or Clinton— no, no it is not only possible, but probable, that we shall never all assemble again, about the bright hearth and bountiful table of the season. But faint not—nor sleep. Remember us—me—and do your duty. If you can be with us—if you can, without any sacrifice of duty—I shall be the happiest woman upon earth—but if not—remember, on Christmas next, if you are out on duty, where you can see the sky, and feel the wind—that others are watching and praying for you, all night long; for that will certainly happen. Our mother's love to you, and Archibald, whose name agitates her to tears, whenever it is mentioned; and Mr. Rodman—our father's too. We expect great things of you all.—Farewell—Your country first—Clara last.' `What! not one word—' said Archibald, dropping his hands, with a sick and despairing helplessness, upon the table. `Yes'— I replied, reading on: `Poor Lucia does nothing but weep all day and all night—she is so altered, that you would scarcely know her. Why she suffers more cruelly than I, is naturally to be accounted for:—she is younger, and her swain is pestering her continually with letters that would make any heart bleed—never more than a line or too—and written—as if he were on horseback—while the pen is never out of her hand. Poor dear Lucia.—I like not the commencement of this affair—but her happiness is in the keeping of heaven—of an honourable man, though an imprudent one—and of your brother Archibald—tell him this.' `God bless her,'—said Archibald, covering his face, and bowing his head, religiously—till it touched the gray locks of our father. `Tell him also that he is properly appreciated—his honesty, I mean, and good intention, in his note to poor Lucia.—It appeared to jar her a good deal at first, but she pronounced his name, with a benediction, when she had read it—and then turned deadly sick—but, as she did not offer to let me see it, I have never importuned her about it, feeling assured that I may trust the dear creature to Archibald now, as I would, if he were her twin brother.' The tears trickled through his fingers, and fell, drop by drop, past the light, so that I could count them, where I sat, though little did he think that they could be seen. `What did you write to her?' said I—`is it a secret?' `No,' he replied—taking a paper out of his pocket. `That is the very note. She returned it to Clinton— but finish the letter.' `I have finished it,' I replied. `No—there is some writing atwhart the outer page.' I turned the letter, and found the following words written, as if—after the letter had been folded—`What is Clinton's real name? Lucia knows it—but father does not—and he is a little angry and sore about it. Tell the colonel—if he be a colonel—to tell his name quickly —if he have any—or—' (the rest was illegible). `But why did she return your note?' said I, opening it—`and to you?' `She did not. I wish that she had kept it, and sent Clinton a copy—pshaw!—what drivelling tenderness is this! Why should I wed the wife of another man—his wife— (his voice died away, into a low muttering sound, as he continued)—aye—let me believe it—let me accustom myself to think of it—Lucia—Lucia Clinton—ah— well, well—' The note— `Clinton has spoken disrespectfully of you. You best know whether you have merited it. My notion of the man is, that he is a dissolute, unthinking fellow—a tyrant in temper—changeable as the wind—and utterly unworthy of your love. I have told him so. I have told him that I would inform you of it. But I did not tell him—as I do you, that there are noble qualities in his nature—that, much of his profligacy is, of manner, rather than heart; that I believe he may be, in time, worthy of the unutterable happiness that—no matter, Lucia—I only pray that you will be firm; such men are only to be taught wisdom by their suffering. Make him suffer—be firm—they value nothing, but in proportion to the difficulty of attainment.—Would you win him?—Beware how you let him see his power over you. Would you keep him?—Set a guard upon your very pulse—thought—and eyes. Would you charm away the licentious spirit of his nature?—banish the evil one that abides in his heart, and settle him down VOL. I. 13* into a hero?—for that he may be, if you deal aright with him—I would not hurt your innocent heart, Lucia, you know that I would not—be wary—unyielding---prepared—and let him having nothing to boast of, in any event —something to hope for—whatever may happen. You understand me—I know your noble, unthinking, pure and lofty confidence—but he is not the man for such confidence—not yet, I mean;—what he may be, must depend upon you.' `ARCHIBALD OADLEY.' Having copied this, for your eyes, my dear children, from the original, which is yet in my possession; I will now endeavour to give you the substance, and indeed much of the very language (for, I had that, till the house was burnt) of her's to Clinton, which enclosed Archibald's to her. `Dear Clinton, `Am I never to see you again?—Where are you? We hear the noise of artillery—and, night after night, the sky is reddened with the blaze of some farm house. Heaven only knows what will become of us—I am very wretched, very—need I tell you why—O! Clinton, there is a yearning here, an unsatisfied, dreadful—I know not what to call it—it is, as if my heart had been exhausted in a receiver—it is very terrible. And sometimes, when I catch a glimpse of my haggard face in the furniture—for I dare not look in a glass—I—I—cannot but weep. Do come to me—we are not safe—I am sure that we are not. There is no body but my poor sick father, and four or five men, chiefly servants, to defend us in case of another midnight—gracious God, Clinton, can you bear to think of such an event!— But why need I ask you—what have you at hazard? —what have I now?—Ask your own heart—mine cannot answer. It would die—to meet your face—I know not how I have been able to write thus much— there is a rush of shame, and horrour, and indignation through my whole frame. Clinton—is that true?—read that note. Have you dared to—not to outrage my name— I hope—ere the print of your lips had left my forehead —but have you dared to speak of me lightly?—dis— yes, that is the word—but I cannot write it—read the note for yourself: read it—is it true? If it be—hear me Clinton—hear me—You little know me—but you know something of what I may be able to do, by what I have already doen—you little know me, if you believe me tame or spiritless. Ask Archibald—that stout hearted boy—Archibald, whom I—O, do not flatter yourself Clinton, it was not all love—so sudden—measureless— appalling—O, no—it was not—but I sacrificed him to you—and—I rave strangely Clinton, and cannot for the life of me, retain, even in conversation, the ordinary coherency of life. Perhaps I am disordered—I could almost pray that I may be—but let me see you first— once more, only once. Yet what do I say—he is honest, so honest that I cannot doubt him—so fearless that, I am mad to put his godlike spirit in such peril—and therefore I must believe him. Hear me! My thought is steadier for a moment. Hear me!—what I say, that will I do. Much as I have loved you—do love you— if you have spoken disrespectfully of me—(yes! that is the very word—I have written it, at last)--farewell, for ever!—farewell! farewell!—There is no hope for you---none!—Depend upon nothing that has passed ---place no confidence in my weakness---nor in the recollection of it---you understand me----the heat that thawed in your breath, will have been frozen to adamant ---never to melt again---never---never!---if it be true.--- I know what your hope will be---but you will be disappointed---sorrow stricken. Young as I am--beautiful as they say that I am---passionate and tender, as you know me to be---that---even that---will have no weight with me. Shame, I can endure---death, death, Clinton---but not INDIGNITY!' I heard my brother gasping for breath, but I dared not look up---and continued to read— `I believe that Archibald tells the truth--I believe therefore that this is a final adieu---and I think that I can see you smile---but my early hope, and you can estimate its lightness, when I tell you that I myself, I; a woman in love to distraction—believe it to be a desperate one ---for I have known Archibald for many years---you but for a few weeks---I think that I can see you smile, haughtily and confidently, while you read the threat--- as if assured, in your own heart, that one word or look of your's, will bring the love sick girl---now that she is so utterly in your power—upon your bosom again. You are mistaken. If it be true---farewell for ever! But beware of my father---of John---of Arthur ---and most of all, of Archibald—your blood Clinton, I would not have it spilt for me—but, I cannot prevent it. I foresee that, if Archibald tell the truth—if ---do I say if---O! God that that should be my only hope---falsehood in Archibald Oadley.! Do not believe that I doubt him, because I enclose his letter to you---No---it is because I would show my confidence in you.— — If you are innocent---put your sword ---not through his heart---not---no, no---let him alone ---let him perish in his own way:---if guilty---God forever bless you Clinton---but I have done with you.' My tears, in spite of all my efforts to the contrary, now ran, with a feeling of insupportable heat and soreness, down my cheeks. I folded the letter, and reached it to my brother without lifting my eyes—but having held it for a moment—and not observing any motion to take it, I spoke. `The letter brother — —' He returned no answer—and in turning round—for he was a little at my left side, I found him, with his head and arms hanging lifelessly over the body of my father, as if his noble heart had stopped forever. For twenty minutes, that I employed myself in chafing his temples, our father standing over him, like a dead man, helpless and horrour struck, he gave no sign of life. But, at last,—O! it was the happiest moment of mine,—he opened his eyes—moved them about, faintly, for a moment or two, rested them upon our father, and then put out his hand, with a slow, reverent motion. `Do not weep father—do not—nor you, brother—Help me out into the air awhile, and I shall be well.' `It snows violently, dear brother—and you are all in a sweat—' said I, putting out my hand through the canvass— `It matters, not—lead me out,' he replied—`I can bear the snow—but not the heated atmosphere of this apartment—it chokes me.' `Poor fellow' our breath was congealed upon our cloaks, within that heated atmosphere. We led him out, therefore—and the wind whistled, and the fine snow was driven, through and through, his beautiful hair, and into his bosom—yet it melted, as soon as it struck his forehead—and his patient eyes shone out, so brightly, that we were terrified — At last he stood up—knit his brows—brushed away the snow from his coat, and turning to us—said that he was `ashamed of himself'—but, while he spoke, evidently, with the desire of proving that he was altogether restored,—he fainted away again, and would have fallen into the drifted snow, but for my father. We were justly alarmed now, and sent for the physician of the corps. He came, and ordered Archibald to be brought immediately to his own quarters, which were rather better furnished, than the others,—and fitted up as a sort of hospital.—All the next day he never opened his lips—nor the next night, except to ask the time, and order the horse to be out, at the exercise, an hour earlier than usual—intending to be with them, but he could not—and it was not till almost noon, when the stirring about him, as we struck our tents, awoke him, that he seemed to recollect himself, for he immediately arose, and with a little assistance, dressed himself, in spite of the remonstrance of the physician. `You do not understand my malady, dear doctor,' he said, buckling his cimetar upon his side. `It is inactivity—thought—ha! Clinton—what are they doing?' `First let me ask you—' (giving him his two hands, with the utmost cordiality and frankness)—`are you able to undergo another night's duty, before sleep.' `Yes—but I hope that it will be the last.' `Nay, do not flatter yourself—weary so soon?—ha! what do you mean, Oadley—are you desponding?' `No, no—what's to be done?—tell me,' said my brother, repeatedly—setting his foot upon the table, which shook with the unsteady pressure—and belting his spurs, with a faint trembling hand, and a sick aspect. `You are very weak, dear Archibald,' said Clinton, taking the strap from his hand—but, if you can sit your horse, you must. `Washington has spoken of you, in Council, not an hour since; and you are to be entrusted with serious duty. I knew that you were ill—but I kept it a secret, till I had seen you. Can you keep your saddle.' `Yes—For awhile. What is to be done?' `About an hour before dark,' said Clinton, all on fire with the thought of battle—`you will put your men in motion, secretly, and come in, by a circuit at McKonkey's Ferry, there to cover an embarkation, which will take place, at dark. You will be particularly wanted —Sullivan and Greene have no horse there—and my notion is, that, after taking your party, we shall have to dismount all the troops, and take their horses, for our light artillery—but that is not yet determined upon. Don't interfere with Knox's men—they are jealous as the devil of the southerners. Keep clear of them— and consider yourself under Washington's command alone, and move only for yourself, when he is away.' `But whither are we to march?' said my father— `I feel rather awkward.' `New levies always do,' said Clinton, laughing. `But we shall soon put you in training; not a man knows the design yet. First, we are to cross the Delaware— that is all that we know yet. Cadwallader has moved off, in beautiful style—not a man knows for what—and Irwing I saw, a few hours ago, putting his men in motion. My thought is—God bless Washington, for keeping the good old fashion!—that we are to give the enemy a Christmas ball—and dance— `Christmas!—' said I, involuntarily—glancing at Archibald— `By heaven!' he replied, walking to the door of the tent, `so it is;—who knows what may have happened, at the appointed hour. Brother, brother—the chairs may be empty—of our bodies—but—which of our spirits may not be among them, at the hour of their fullest revelry.' I was inconceivably affected—his manner was so solemn, settled—and the tone of his voice so inward and prophetick. But we had no time to exchange either congratulation or encouragement, for every moment was precious. Our men were paraded—in the light of the setting sun—the whole camp under arms—tents struck, and a general, but beautiful celerity, full of strictness and precision, gave evidence that something momentous was in agitation.—Washington came out, just ahead of us, and mounted his great white horse, with that air of absolute authority, which began to distinguish all his movement about this time—for congress had made him little less than a dictator at last—and Archibald, when once upon the back of his spirited little mare, seemed to forget, in the presence of his Commander in Chief, all sense of infirmity, if not of mortality; for when Clinton raised his sword, while he rode by the side of Washington,—as a signal to my brother to set off, it was done in such a gallant, soldier like style, that Washington pressed his white charger forward at least twenty yards abreast of my brother, utterly regardless of the young cavalcade about him—as if carried away, for a moment, with enthusiasm—and well he might have been, for my brother's eyes shone intensely bright—and his pale, boyish face was illuminated with a strange settled sternness, well calculated to startle the boldest. — For my own part, I forgot his age, and moved after him as if I had been the junior—but so it has been through my life; that boy, after the first twenty years of his course, during which I had passed by him, regardless of his eye or attitude, took his position, all at once, and was never afterwards driven from it. I tried, again and again—to recover my ancient sway— that was in vain—my equality next—that was equally so—till at last, wearied out with a perpetual warfare against a spirit that always would keep in advance, though all his arteries, heart and veins had been ruptured and burst in the effort, I silently abandoned myself to his steady dominion:—acknowledged his supremacy, and slept quietly ever afterward. The night was intensely cold, and we were delayed many hours longer than had been anticipated, by an accumulation of ice in the river. And here, if you would get a good notion of the countenance of Washington at this time—the most eventful and trying moment of his life, I would recommend that you study a picture just painted by a Mr. Sully of Philadelphia, upon this subject. He has been singularly happy--- and when I recollect the face of Washington, as he reined up, for half an hour, within pistol shot of me, it appears to me that some man must have painted it, who was with us at the time. Before we came down to the Ferry—there was an awful solemnity, darkness and repose in it. But there, when in sight of the troops, as they were severally embarking, every man of whom, so long as the face of their Commander could be seen, even after the boats had put off, kept his eyes upon it, was full of a loftier, more animated, youthful and heroick expression, of encouragement and confidence. You have heard of general Knox, then Colonel---and of his stentorian voice. I assure you that no justice can be done to him or it; my ears rang, for a fortnight after, at the same hour of the night; and do yet, when I remember how he galloped about, cursing and swearing, dismounting every five minutes, and lifting at his own artillery, like a giant. He was a gallant fellow--- full of blood—with all the blunt, strong New England hardihood. And Greene too--he was there---the only man of all our armies, capable, I believe, in case of any disaster, to take the place of Washington, there he sat, full of deep religious composure,---his broad forehead fronting the fires, that were kindled near the place of embarkation. At last, though not until three o'clock in the morning, we were fairly landed upon the Jersey shore, and, by five, had taken up our line of march. Clinton was every where—riding through the horsemen, along by the infantry and artillery, carrying orders, cheering the men, and infusing, wherever he moved, the very spirit of chivalry. But my brother—poor fellow, and my father too—were silent as death—I saw them, while the division was forming, meet—shake hands— and part—but I, alas! I had no opportunity to embrace the old man, before we were upon the march; but he saw me, and, holding out his sword, shook it manfully, as if to encourage me.—I answered the signal. I saw no more of him till the affair was all over. `It was very remarkable,' said my brother, in a low voice—`Rodman take the command awhile—(Rodman leaped forward, and as he passed me, I heard his loud breathing, as if now, he was about to be happy indeed) —`it is very remarkable, my dear brother, that they should be, at this moment, sitting about a table, with three or four empty chairs at it—for three or four living men—a father, two sons---and a cousin—is it not awful to think what may happen?' `It is impossible,' said I---`you forget the hour---it must be near morning.' `There,' said he---as if awaking all of a sudden--- `and it is not till to-morrow night, Christmas night, that the chairs will be set for us---dead or alive. I had forgot. I had half persuaded myself that, at this moment, their eyes were fixed on a screne blue sky, it may be, in prayer for us---little dreaming that the snow, and rain, and darkness are driving in our faces, and that—' `Hush brother,' said I---`we are overheard.'—`I care not, though it be by Washington himself,' continued my brother---`Nay, do not trouble yourself to look behind. Whoever it be, he shall see that I am not the VOL. I. 14 worse fitted for death, for having prepared myself for it. `Death!' said I---and would have added some words of reproof, had not a tall majestick figure, on a horse, that, even in a rank of white horses, appeared unusually white, rode slowly athwart our rear—followed by ten or twelve other horsemen. `By heaven---brother!---You will have lost his favour. It was Washington himself',---said I--- `I care not,' he replied, `George Washington himself, if he be the good and great man that I think him, has a heavier heart than I, at this moment—is as sorry at the thought of the blood, that he is about to spill— and altogether better prepared for death.' `Brother,' said I, after a moment's pause, `we are strangely disturbed by our disorderly watching and sleep—last night was Christmas eve after all—this morning—I feel it at my heart—yes, I am sure of it!— eyes that we know—lips that we love—hearts that we would die for, are all in prayer for us—at this blessed moment. As I live, the thought rushes in upon me, distending my own heart, till it aches, with fullness.' `And so it is, as I hope for mercy! Well, heaven be praised--farewell brother—let us do our duty--and commit ourselves to God—I see the light breaking in there, and a movement--hush--hush! farewell!' `Farewell!' said I `brother'—and just then, our whole army passed softly, and silently, by two or three officers, one of whom I knew to be Clinton, posted upon the road side, continually waving their swords, with a motion, as if to enjoin the most deathlike stillness; and deathlike it was, for nothing could be heard, but the blowing of the horses, a jolting sound, now and then in the wet snow, where the Artillery wagons and gun-carriages cut through into the ground—and a general rush, as of deep heavy water. A few moments after, a troop of Virginians, under Captain Washington, (afterward so distinguished at the south) paraded, in beautiful style, through the heavy snow, and brought us intelligence which tended to accelerate our march. Before his arrival, we had hoped (as I afterward found) to surprise the enemy, at Trenton, while yet overpowered by the festivities of the preceding night—and make his morning sleep, the sleep of death;—but now that hope was abandoned, for Captain Washington had encountered his picket, exchanged a few shot, and left him prepared for, what, it is remarkable that he had already heard a vague rumour of—our intended attack. Yet this very affair, which, at first, threatened to be so disastrous, the frolick of Captain Washington, was probably the chief reason why we succeeded in surprising the enemy, at last; for, as that was not followed up, he retired to quarters, after waiting a reasonable time, as we afterward found, thinking the whole a Virginia row. Our troops were now thrown into two divisions.— We were separated from our father—who was detailed under Sullivan and St. Clair to take the river road— while we, under Washington himself, Greene, Morris, and Stevens, pushed onward through what is called the Pennington road: A few moments afterward—just while I thought my heart had lost its motion entirely—for I felt, in looking about me, and seeing the dark array of substantial, but noiseless creatures, horses and wagons—as if the whole army were an apparition—a cavalcade of dead men— marching from one place of burial to another:--I heard a shot, so near me that my horse leaped out of the rank. This was followed by a loud cry—two or three words ---a volley—and then, shot after shot, as if a line of sentinels, sleeping upon their post, had suddenly started up, one after the other, fired off their pieces, and run in. Our advance were well furnished with bayonets--- and they immediately charged upon the picket, and, we dashed after them, trampling them to death, with our horses, riding over them like a whirlwind, without speaking a word, or firing a shot. This was scarcely done, when we heard the firing of the other division, at the opposite quarter---so admirably timed had been the arrangement—and we immediately galloped into the centre of the town, horse and foot, determined to ride the enemy down, or bayonet them, before they had time to form. Washington was dreadfully exposed. The first picket, thinking this a second attack of the same little skirmishing party, that had fired into them before, neglected to give the alarm:---an dthe outposts, though they fought most gallantly, retreating, step by step, behind the houses, disputing every inch, and presenting their bright bayonets, without a flash of powder, where-ever we rode in upon them---so that we could not, with all our cutting and spurring, force our horses upon them—and then, the moment that we faced about, blazing away upon us, and running to the next house—were driven in. At last we had an opportunity for fair play; the Hessians were formed and forming, with the whole front glittering with bayonets. A tremendous struggle was going on at our right, under the very eye of Washington, with the enemy's artillery, which was taken, when, with a troop of horse, in which I fancied that I could see my father, nay, I am almost certain that it was he, by the disorderly movement of his horse, for he broke out of the ranks, and was twenty yards ahead of the other men—Archibald rode down, his cap off, his sword flashing, like a fire brand, in the light and smoke of the musquetry—`charge! charge!' they cried—`charge! my brave fellows! and provoke them to fire'—Another troop! Another! and another! thundered down, from the right and left, but with no effect at all, upon the invincible Germans--their front rank kneeled all round--while the rest were forming, and presented their bayonets, without firing a shot. `By heaven!' said Archibald, shouting as if his heart would break, to Captain Washington—`I will try them again!' And, as he said so, he rode at full speed, so near that it appeared to me that he could have struck the enemy with his sword---and fired his pistol into their faces. Our front rank followed the example---and the next moment, all the Hessians brought their pieces up to their cheeks, and poured a tremendous volley in upon us---I saw my father fall---Arthur reel in his stirrups---but Archibald, as if prepared for this very thing ---shouted, `wheel and charge!' `Wheel and charge!' repeated a hundred voices in our rear—`wheel and charge!' We obeyed—and the snow flew—and the swords flashed—and the next moment, a hundred of the enemy—the whole of his front rank were trampled to death before us, and twenty human heads rolled upon the ground, among the feet of our horses. The infantry under Greene poured in, volley after volley, at the same time; and Knox, having brought round his light field pieces to bear, as if they had been blunderbusses, played in upon them, with an uninterrupted roll of thunder and smoke. It was impossible to stand it—no human being could have endured the hurricane of fire and bullets longer.— They threw down their arms—about one thousand men in all—and then was it—then—when it was necessary to move about the quieter operations of strife, that we began to feel the intense coldness of the night—the keen air cutting into our new wounds, like rough broken glass. —Several were frozen to death, and two of our own men. But my agony was for my father: heedless of the reiterated command of Arthur, and Clinton, and Washington himself, who was impatient to be away—with his prisoners, before a rescue---I continued riding over the field, and examining the bodies. At last I found him ---the good old man---flat upon his back---his great heart heavy with the bullets that had been poured into it. I wondered at my own calmness---when I first discovered the body---at my own unspeakable collectedness. At first there was a darkness and dizziness about my eyes---and then I began to doubt if I were in my right senses---but Archibald and Arthur rode up to me, the latter with his white pantaloons covered all over with blood and dirt---and we alighted---and tearing open his bosom, discovered that there was no life in him---that VOL. I. 14* his aged breast was literally blown to pieces; and the trumpet blowing---we took the dead hand in ours, sucsessively, without looking at each other---cut off, hurriedly a lock of his grey hair---saturated and stiff with frozen blood---mounted and left him—with an inconceivable calmness—for—it was not till our wounds were dressed, that we thought of our mother—our poor, dear mother. `One of the chairs,' said my brother passing me, and pointing to a litter in which I could distinguish a wounded officer—`was not vacant—although it might not have been given to mortal eye to see, with whom it was filled—and another had well nigh been at the feast of the dead.' `God be thanked, brother,' said I, `that it is neither you nor Arthur. But whom do you mean?' `God's will be done!'—was the reply—`I spoke of Clinton—he had two horses shot under him---and was brought down, at last, by the same volley, with captain Washington. I saw him, when he fell—he waved his sword to me —and if ever man's face spoke, without sound, his said—Archibald I repent—God bless the woman of my heart! I hope that he is not mortally wounded. He was a brave fellow---and—and---I have been very hard upon him---I could not have borne so much, I fear—a generous fellow, for—' `Are you not grateful, brother, for the protection of heaven?' `Grateful! brother!'—he replied—smiting his breast—`that were a poor word to express the unutterable thankfulness of my heart. Washington is safe— you are safe---Arthur is safe---our country is safe—and I—I have not been cut off in the bossom of my pride.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. “—Thou, land of the free! “Thou hope of the nations! what trance is in thee! “Thou parent of heroes!—the bravest and best, “That ere smote the plumage from Tyranny's crest.” `Brother,' said I, as we stood side by side, again, holding our horses by the bit and throat lash, to steady them, under the movement of the boat—`this is the third time that we have been upon the waters of the Delaware, in darkness, with horsemen and horses about us. What fearful vicissitudes for men like us, to have experienced within so short a time.' `True—true brother,' he replied, `the water here, that ripples along our boat side, shining like broken silver—drifting against it, may run blood yet, under the burden that is now upon it. We are growing old apace. If years are to be numbered by events and trial, we are already aged men!'—He stopped—and a long breath showed how deeply he had been employed. `They fought gallantly,' said I. `They did indeed brother; and Wilkinson—you remember Wilkinson, he was close at my side during a part of the hottest fire, cheering us on, in the finest style (it was the present General Wilkinson, my children)—and Washington—the Captain—his voice and sword were every where.' `But who was that young man, that I saw rushing forward, his face blackened with the smoke of the enemy's cannon—just under your horses hoofs, as you charged on the left?—some young officer; was he not?' `You probably mean Lieutenant Monroe—once, I was so struck by the solemn, undisturbed earnestness of his countenance, that I reined up, in the middle of a charge, to look at him.' That same Lieutenant Monroe, is now the President of the United States. `Have you learnt the enemy's loss? It must have been very considerable, for our fire was like one continual clap of thunder—' said I. About forty, I heard General Greene say, as I passed him, to Archibald—and among them, their gallant leader, Colonel Rahl—God have mercy upon him! It is a fearful thing to die, so suddenly, in a foreign land —where we have gone to let out our blood, for money— or for glory. Every man has his price—the soldier is little better than the bravo, if he be paid in the same coin —among strangers—poor fellow! and yet—who would wish to survive a blow like this?' `I should not'—said Archibald. `His officers, I am told, complain that he would not permit them to entrench.' `Nonsense, brother—his officers, like all other men —will not take more than their own share of humiliation and shame, you may depend on it. The truth is, that they did not expect us—scorned us—and Cornwallis himself, so it was said yesterday at Washington's table, had once gone back to New York, intending to embark for England—regarding the war as all over— our power extinct. But, it may be, that his lordship was very discreet--very--in postponing such a communication. Washington, it is said, dark and desperate as it was, on all sides, listened to the story, and repeated it, with a pleasant countenance--as the harmless vanity of a young man, who knew not the spirit with which he was contending—a spirit that iron could not bind--nor fire consume--nor darkness, wind nor rain extinguish.' `I saw poor Rahl.' We were now in the deepest part of the river, where the new ice had rushed together, and piled itself up, like a snow drift upon the black water---yielding nevertheless to the pressure of our boat, as, by some unskilful management, she was brought against it, in the eddy, and merging all under the water, as if it had been a frozen spray, light as the very vapour. We were jarred, horse and man, by the contact, for a moment, as if our boat had suddenly foundered---but after a brief, violent struggle, our horses recovered their foot hold, braced themselves, anew, with their instinctive sagacity, against the ridges, purposely provided in the bottom of the boat, and my brother continued. `I saw him---poor fellow---while his officers were gather round him---his nostrils swimming in blood---his dark eyes hardly yet extinct---and his shoulder absolutely shot away. There was a calm, terrible darkness in the aspect of death then---so suddenly---hot with the festivity of the night, dreaming, but one blessed moment before, of his babes and his dear one. Brother! say what you will, this trade of war, demands a tremendous preparedness—a heart of stone—an eye of fire—a hand of iron. A trade that—O, we may yet live—till the rush of our blood is done—the eddy of our heart frozen---the foam and froth of our arteries hushed, in a repose, more awful than death---when, for the very deeds, that we have done this day, tears from the eye, and blood from the heart---may be no expiation. Brother I tremble.' `It is the night wind Archibald.' `No brother, not the night wind; that could not penetrate to my vitals, or make me feel so coldly; so like death, just here.' Our boat struck just then, and so unexpectedly, as to make our horses stumble upon us. We were in some danger, but Archibald's presence of mind, and my bodily strength prevented any disaster. He leaped out of the boat, to avoid the hoofs of the mare—and she plunged, headlong, after him, followed by half a dozen other horses, that had been first thrown upon their knees by the sudden jar, and kept there by the boat swiming round. It was not deep, and Archibald had the self recollection, to abandon the bridle, and dive under our boat,—while I, leaping into the rotten ice, and half frozen water—kept off the horses from the shore till he had secured his foot hold. We had then little difficulty in bringing out all of them but one, and he, poor fellow, was of such prodigious strength, and temper, that we feared to approach him. Several times he swam up to us, and stretched out his head, as if to bring the bridle within our reach, but we were too far from him. He then attempted to mount the ice, and plunged, at least fifty times, into the deepest part of the river, blowing and snorting the while, so that we could hear him all along the shore.— And, now and then, through the sleet and darkness, we could see the noble creature throw himself half out of the river—place his fore feet upon the newly formed ice—make a desperable effort—the ice would give way—we would hear the rush and plunge—he would go under—and rise. Our boats were such great unmanageable things, we were utterly unable to assist him—at last he grew desperate—the rattling of his nostrils became incessant—his blows upon the ice—one uninterrupted struggle, then—poor creature, a long, loud, half suffocated neigh—a few more struggles, and he passed under the ice, as we supposed, for we heard a sound as if it came from the bottom, long afterward—afar off—and dying away in the distance and darkness. I declare, strange as it may seem, that men who had been in battle—and seen their own father dead without shedding a tear—should be so overcome by the death of a brute—yet I declare to you that our hearts were heavy—even to tears; and either of us would have risked his own life, I have no doubt, for the safety of the noble animal—when we heard his last loud, convulsive sobbing, and saw the amazing strength of his blows, as he broke through the ice at every leap. We were instantly formed, and all the prisoners, to prevent the possibility of recapture, from a desperate enemy, stung to madness at the nature of the blow, that he had received—were marched off to Philadelphia, under a strong escort;—composed of all our horse, and the chief part of our light infantry—so called—not because we had any heavily armed infantry— but because they were in a measure provided with guns and bayonets. This step was a wise one, for the enemy had a force along the Delaware, far superior to ours; and, at Princeton, a battalion of infantry. This was the first time that I had ever been in Philadelphia—and I rode along, street after street, of noble buildings, side by side with my brother, who seemed—I know not for what reason, except that his face was remarkably pale, and full of a noble, uncommon expression for one so youthful—to attract universal attention. The streets were thronged, but whether in congratulation or not, it would have been difficult to say. The women certainly looked pleased, and some were beautiful indeed,—so beautiful, that many a stout heart rode unsteadily by them; and so I remember particularly, as we wheeled from Sixth into Market-street, a throng of girls—among whom was one—who laughed as we passed—and one that uttered a cry—I heard the voice, but did not see her—by Heaven, I thought that Arthur would have fallen from his horse. I dared not look at him—till the animal, surprised by the loose rein, dashed over the pavement, as if he had been shot through the heart, the length of two or three squares, before Arthur could bring him to his place again. And now and then too, as I passed along, I could see a broad brimmed hat, a pretty little bashful face, with the hair parted smoothly upon the forehead, a something in a drab coloured dress—conscientiously scrupulous against being seen to look upon military parade, in the open street—here and there, peeping with scandalous if not impious eagerness, through the half open curtains, or shutters of a high window—or door standing just upon the jar. For several days after the battle, we were kept in continual motion—scarcely eating or sleeping—marching and countermarching in all directions; first, after collecting a body of Pensylvania militia, under General Mercer, as brave a fellow as ever stood fire, and leaving our prisoners at Philadelphia, we immediately returned to the Delaware, and recrossed it again, making the fourth time, that Archibald and I had gone from one shore to the other, with swelling hearts and mournful thoughts—alike in that—yet how unlike in all that shakes the sinew, or shortens the breath of men!— At first, we were adventurers—untried in battle, going to camp, and flying, in consternation, before a scornful army that lined the opposite bank, and kept squibbing at us, in derision; the second time, upon a matter of such peril, that, if we failed—and that we did not, was miraculous, as two out of three of the divisions did fail, (I speak of those under Cadwallader and Irwing,) the pulse of all America would have stopped—perhaps forever:—desperate men, going in darkness and storm, upon the sleeping and dreaming, like the angels of death; the third time—conquerors, high in heart—covered with blood and glory—with all the sleepers and dreamers in our power—the fourth which was the present time, with a complicated feeling of apprehension and thrilling delight. We marched to Trenton, and took possession of it, with an army of only eighteen hundred men. This was on the twenty ninth of December—and, of this number, twelve hundred were to be discharged on the first of January!—Tremble my children—read the history of these days, and tremble!—God fought with us, or we had perished, again and again, in our blindness and infatuation:—bounties were offered—enormous for the time—two dollars a head—they were taken, pocketed— and carried off; but at last, the Pennsylvania militia came in, electrified by the shock at Trenton, which had caused the enemy's heart to contract, and his extremities to be drawn in—and our force was augmented to about five thousand men. One day, while we were in this situation, my brother came to me, with the traces of, what always astonished me, when I saw them upon his face,—tears upon his countenance. `I have just left Clinton—I have wept with him—I shall love him, I fear, better than ever.' `Fear—why so?' `Because if I once love him—my hand will tremble, I am afraid, when the time of judgment is at hand— I—.' `What mean you brother?---There is that in your eyes which I would fain see dissipated—you are not the man I hope,---I believe, Archibald, to spill the blood of a human creature, for any lighter cause than the salvation of your country. You shake your head.---Archibald---my brother!---have I not heard you denounce the duellist, duelling!---You do not deny it— then why—' He interrupted me impatiently---`let us talk no more about it, now—I shall do nothing rashly. Be assured of that—but we are exceedingly earnest to get Clinton away. I think that—what say you to it?— if he could be nursed tenderly; very tenderly by— by—I cannot well utter my thought, brother; but what need of words? You understand me—will you escort him to Mr. Arnauld's?—I see that you are surprised—but if you will not, I will, and deliver him, with my own hands into the arms of Lucia, and help him to make his peace with her.' `That is my noble Archibald!' I cried, embracing him—`that is what I looked for. Yes—I will go— or you—or—' `No---brother—I prefer that you should go. I shall never enter the door again, if I can help it.— But you may—' `You have forgiven him then—relented?'— `No---but Lucia may, if she please. I have no concern with her. I have done my duty, and I leave it to her, to do hers. My opinion is, that there is only one course for her to pursue—but that—O, it is only one star in a midnight firmament of total blackness.' I looked at him for sometime, without opening my lips. A strange thought darted, like a startled eaglet, from the high place of her abiding, athwart my mind— VOL. I. 15 but, ere I could look to her place in the sky, or her shadow on the earth, she was gone, unseen and unheard--- and all was hushed and beautiful, as the pale blue air of a warm day. I dared not lure it back---I dared not mention it---it was a flash of unutterable brightness, and I dropped my eyes, when it passed, as if blinded by it. I don't know that you will understand me, my children, but I have been endeavoring to be very fine—after the fashion of the day. `You will go then?' said he, laying his hand upon my shoulder, and looking me, affectionately, in the face ---`you will go---and you will see—her---her whom you love—and you will be happy. Forgive my perturbation, brother; it is not envy—no!—but it is a far deadlier feeling, to a heart like mine—it is hopelessness—God bless you, and her—and (hesitating her too!' `Are we to have another battle?' said I—`thert are mysterious movements in camp—and midnight councils.' `I believe that we may begin to look for one,' was the reply. `Washington cannot retreat---all the eyes of America are upon him—he is supposed to be five times as strong as he is; and if he should retreat, with his augmented force, the people would fall back into their old despondency. The enemy are cruelly exasperated, and bent upon retaliation. Cornwallis, I know, has abandoned his design of carrying out the news of our destruction—for a few days longer,—joined his men in the Jerseys, concentrated his whole power—left a body at Princeton, and is now moving upon us, at this place. The firing that we heard just now, was the advance of his army, encountering that of our's under Greene.'— While we were yet speaking, several horsemen came in, at full gallop; and it was soon known, for we were in our saddles, before the noise of their hoofs, had ceased ringing in our ears, that Greene, who had been sent out to reinforce a small advance, placed about a mile in front—had met them in a disorderly retreat and was himself thrown into confusion, by their rascally impetuosity, to get away from the enemy. There was only one way to arrest them. Knox and Greene advanced four capital field pieces, to the bank of a little stream before us, called the Suspinck creek, and played upon them, with such a blaze, and tempest, that they fell back, and left us at leisure to arrange nearly forty pieces, some of which were ready to open upon them, at their first approach. It was a beautiful night— `Would that I might communicate with Lucia, for a single moment!' said Archibald, as we drew out our whole cavalry, to the left of the line of cannon, from which an uninterrupted roll of thunder, smoke and brightness, was kept up, while we were conversing —`but—my heart is heavy brother, not, I believe with apprehension, or doubt, but with—do not smile upon me—with a foreboding. I may not see Lucia again.—I have treated her harshly—We are on the eve of another battle—that little creek is fordable—the whole force of the enemy is assembled on the opposite bank—our's upon this.—Cornwallis— look! by heaven, the whole sky is in a blaze!'— I turned about, and saw the heights at the westward of the town, all alive with bustle and light— Cornwallis displaying, and extending his columns, with narrow intervals—(whence the artillery. thundered upon us, incessantly,)—as if to gain our rear —outflank us, and put us to the sword without mercy. —Yet it was beautiful, magnificent. The very earth shook under the roar of the cannon—and the air was loud with a perpetual reverberation—the sky black with smoke.—Add to this, that we were not one thousand yards apart.— `A battle is inevitable.' continued my brother— `It may be fatal to one of us, and if these feelings may be trusted, it will—they are not those of fear, or despondency, but rather of a solemn religious belief, that I am not to survive it.—If I fall'—(drawing his bright weapon, and severing a lock of hair from his temples,) `give that to Lucia; tell her that—that— I loved her to my last breath—and bid her love another —if she can!'— His manner was awful, really awful—my blood ran cold at the sound of his voice—and his lips, it appeared to me, were motionless, emitting sound, in some inward, preternatural way.— `I accept the hair,' said I, `but I am ashamed of my brother—ashamed of him, for the first time in my life'— He smiled mournfully—took my hand—and holding it, for a moment, to his breast, said—`I do not blame you. You have no such feelings. Heaven doth not vouchsafe them to you—to any but the weary and wasted—to them that pray not to live.— Ashamed of me! are you?—By to-morrow night, John,—when the red sun hath gone down—your feeling will be more of sorrow than shame—perhaps for these words;—if it should be—remember—remember that Archibald forgave you, and blessed you!'— He fell upon my neck, and kissed me, while his soft hair was blown into my eyes,—and over my lips.— `But—if I survive—if—why then brother, you shall be welcome to feel ashamed of me, and of what I have said—the weather is very moist and warm —I am sweltering under this cloak.'— `But keep it on, nevertheless,' said I—`we have sudden changes along here; and before morning you may want more cloaks than one.'— An officer here rode up to my brother, and ordered him to trot his horses loudly about the rear—while the baggage, and three pieces of ordnance moved off to Burlington— `They are in Council,' said the officer—`and we know not what will be done—it is getting very cold'— `Yes'—said Archibald,—`the most sudden change that I ever felt. It is not five minutes since I was complaining of the strange closeness and warmth of the air!'— `I felt the same, half an hour ago—Ha! what means that! some stratagem I suppose.'— I looked, and found that our troops were doubling their fires the whole length of their line— `It will be intensely cold, I am sure,' said I—`the iron tread of the troop, rings famously already upon the ground—a single hour since, it was a soft, noiseless blow.—They will want all those fires before morning—look. The north wind has got among the smoke, and the dark blue sky can be seen, in patches all over us—another hour, and I will answer for it, that we have a bright, unclouded starlight over head.'—`And a wind, that you could sharpen razors against'—said the officer—`these norwesters are mighty keen and wholesome—to people (lowering his voice) in a well built house—before a roaring fire.'— `Shall we fight,' said Archibald— The officer shrugged his shoulders—and replied —`yes—or retreat, by the Jersey side, and cross at Philadelphia—either of which is—speaking after the manner of men—damned hazardous.' Archibald turned away, in displeasure. He would, sometimes, when violently heated, suffer an oath or profane word to escape him, but never, of late, in a serious moment, and never at all, without deep penitence and shame— At length, however, we were directed to gallop along, as silently as we could. And the whole army, upon a road like the solid pavement, now filed off toward Princeton—crossing the creek in a death like silence— behind our double fires, without disturbing the enemy, who deserved to be broken, man and horse, for permitting it,—and arrived at Princeton, a little before day break. This, as you will perceive, in the event, was a masterly manœuvre, and is said to have been proposed by St. Clair, a lion hearted fellow—when all were looking in each other's faces, dreading to speak.—`Right!' answered Washington, after a moment's consideration, `That must be the blow. Cornwallis, it is probable, VOL. I. 15* impatient to retrieve the disaster of Trenton, has pushed upon us with his main body—and left, it is also probable, a weak rear guard at Princeton.'— For eighteen hours had we been under arms—and, for two whole days, constantly employed, in marching, countermarching, and fighting, without an hour's interruption: except at the creek. No sooner said than done!—Our army was in motion; we crossed the creek, as I told you, in a silence like the wind of midnight, and arrived at Princeton, almost without having spoken a loud word, just before day break. The weather was intensely cold, but the whole sky was luminous and beautiful— not a bird could have hurried over it, like the scared swallow, or the drifting eagle, asleep upon the high wind—without being seen. We were already about to join battle—yet—wonderful as it may seem, I felt little or no emotion, certainly none of terrour, but rather, a profound repose in all my faculties, as if they had been overwrought, and slept, as men will sometimes sleep upon a rocking precipice, loosened by the turbulent ocean.—General Mercer was a little in advance, when Major Wilkinson, who first discovered the enemy, (three regiments) about a quarter of a mile distant, on the march for Trenton, dashed athwart the advance, and communicated the intelligence.—At the same moment, an order was given, and Archibald wheeled off to the left, leaving us to follow, and as I approached, giving me his hand for a moment —`farewell! brother, farewell!'—said he, stretching his bright weapon at the full length of his arm, and heaving out his chest, in the star light— `Farewell,' said I, striking the rowels home—and leaping past him—I could not bear it. Colonel Mawhood on account of the ground, saw us, but partially; and taking us for a light party, sent out to harass him, gave himself no trouble about us; neither halted nor formed, but came down upon our infantry, with a steady countenance and quick tread, till the very bayonets clashed—then poured in a volley upon us, and charged. Our men had scarcely a hundred bayonets with them. Most of their pieces were rifles, and they instantly broke, fell back, in disorder. It was a moment of the extremest peril—Washington saw it, and leaped into the space, between the two parties, while our men were forming, reined his magnificent white charger, like a madman, I confess, shot upon the enemy—and received, successively, the whole fire of the two parties without losing a hair of his head. At the same moment, Mawhood, sword in hand, mounted upon a superb animal, with two little spaniel dogs barking and yelping at his heels, wheeled, and galloped, hither and thither, among our men, and finally, cut his way through them, and escaped, over fields and fences, with a few, a very few of his men toward Pennington. At the moment when this charge was made by our troops, in consequence of the desperate hardihood of Washington—the result of which was that sixty of the enemy were bayonetted upon the spot, our little troop darted in upon them, in one uninterrupted blaze and thunder. Never did I hear such a trampling of horses and clashing of swords. We broke our way, literally through the disordered rabble. A party of them escaped to the Colleges, but we pursued them, at full gallop, hewing them down at every plunge, and entered with them, some of us on horseback,—and others, at the head of whom was Arthur, on foot------and soon dislodged them. Greene, we found afterwards, had a slight brush with Cornwallis, who, alarmed at what he took at first to be thunder, in the direction of Princeton, had pushed forward, with desperate eagerness, to the protection of Brunswick, where lay his whole baggage, and where General Lee was held prisoner. We would—but human nature could not hold out longer—we would have set fire to the one, and released the other, before his lordship had recovered from his consternation—but, it was impossible. Our men actually dropped from their horses upon the road; and at every step, some poor fellow threw himself down, praying permission to sleep—what must have been, in the heat, and delusion, and exhaustion of the moment, the sleep of death, undisturbed—upon the drifted snow. Our horses too, during the remainder of our pilgrimage, dragged their very limbs after them so feebly that, while their flanks ran with blood, and their flesh quivered at the touch of the spur, they were unable to keep in a trot for more than fifty yards at a time—and, finally, we were obliged to dismount and lead them, some dropping off by the way, and our men employing themselves all the while in destroying the bridges and breaking up the road, until we arrived, on the sixth, at Morristown, with our prisoners, nearly three hundred in number. Two of the British regiments escaped, the fifty-fifth, by the way of Hillsborough, to Brunswick; and the fortieth, after a little scuffling, to the same place. But the enemy were panick struck. They fell back, shaking in every joint—concentrating at every step, and successively abandoning, in their trepidation, without firing a shot, every foot of ground that they had gained south of New York, except Brunswick and Amboy; while the American Militia awoke all at once, overran the whole country with whatever implements of warfare they could lay their hands on, cutting the enemy up, whenever he dared to shew his face in small parties, till, at last, he was obliged to forage with his main body. Within thirty days, my children, this mighty deliverance had been wrought. Within thirty days, the whole of New Jersey, lying between New Brunswick and the Delaware, had been lost and won, and lost and won again—won first, by a gallant and well appointed army from a shattered and flying rabble— and retaken from the conqueror—wrested from him— in a clap of thunder, by the ghost of an annihilated militia—who had suddenly leaped out of the ground, as it were, at the noise of the cannon at Trenton, as if the trumpet of God had been blown over the buried nations, and the battle field—and each that slept, as he leaped into his saddle again, while the skies were passing away—the stars falling—the sun going down in a rain of blood and fire—had sought his enemy anew, as he was emerging with the dark population,—and thundered upon his crest, as he arose.— — There, my dear Children—I have been willing to forget the battle, and the subject for awhile, and amuse you, for I know your taste and that of our people, with a few rockets,—and—but let me return— `Where, in the name of heaven, is Archibald?' cried Arthur, galloping by me; about four hours after the battle—it was the first time that I had heard his voice for weeks—`I have ransacked the whole field—I have asked every human being—I—' For a moment—I felt as if I were shot through the heart—I remembered Archibald's farewell—I remembered too, seeing him, a little before, dashing among the enemy when they stove into the College, and—`God of heaven,' I exclaimed—dropping the reins of my horse, and reflecting back the terrified paleness of Arthur upon his own forehead—as I recollected where I had seen him—`that must have been he.' `Where! where!' said Arthur, his voice ringing through and through me, like a strong trumpet— `O, it was he! it was he!'—I repeated—`no other living man could have done it—his horse reared as they faced upon him, and fired a volley into his bosom.' `Gracious God,' said Arthur—`did he fall?'—`I know not,' said I—`I did not think of my brother, then —but I remember reining up, and holding my breath, as the smoke rushed out of the College doors and windows—and a man, on horseback, appeared leaping amid a perpetual blaze of powder, and whistling of bullets—' `That was in the College—was it not?' `Yes'—I,' answered, catching at the eager light of his wonderful eyes—`yes!—what hope is there?' `He escaped!—he escaped!—I saw him leap down the high steps, firm in the saddle, giving a cut in the rear as he went; and our party broke in upon the enemy just as a whole platoon was levelled at him— nay, I am sure that not a ball struck him then—but I know nothing more—I have not seen him since.—The piece that was brought up, was so well served, that the enemy surrendered after three or four shots, and I saw no more of your brother—' `He is safe! he is safe!' said one of the troop, riding up, with my sword, which I had dropped, without knowing it, startled at the cry of Arthur, I suppose, as if a dead man had broken silence, while I was standing over him—for he was on foot— `Who is safe!' I cried—striking my spurs into the lacerated flanks of my poor horse, and determining to return to the battle ground, at all peril, and continued the search— `The Captain—the Captain!' he cried—and true it was—for the next moment, Archibald himself appeared, coming in with five of his men at his heels, driving ten or twelve prisoners before them. His action was menacing, and his look frightful.—I should hardly have known him—his whole uniform was saturated with blood, as if he had been bearing wounded men to the hospital.—Upon his white forehead were spattering drops, and his beautiful hair itself, stood out, stiff and frozen, under the pressure of his iron bound cap, as if that too were full of blood. I shuddered as he passed me—I could not speak—I tried, and my lips moved—but I could utter no sound—I felt as if a spirit had gone by me—the hair of my flesh rose, and my flesh itself crawled. Nay, but for me, I verily believe that he would have cloven the skulls of two or three of the prisoners, as they drove them along like wild beasts before them, pricking them at every step with their swords—and flourishing their sabres round their heads—heads that disdained to duck, in the whistle and blaze of the sabres, but looked with a steady eye upon them. Archibald, in particular, seemed as if he could hardly keep his hands off. `For shame,' said I, `brother—O, for shame!' leaping forward, and catching at his arm,—I had half a mind to strike it down with my sword, such was my wrath and horrour,—`warring upon the prisoned, and the helpless!' `Brother!' he replied, wiping the blood from his forehead, and looking at me sternly—`brother, you know not what you do. Were I prone to bloodshed, this foolish interference had cost every man of them, their lives, and you, perhaps—nay, I do not say it jestingly—I am in no humour for trifling now—it might have cost you, yours.—Brother—these eleven men are murderers—they have just put all their bayonets, again and again, through the bravest heart that ever beat— `Whose! I cried'—my blood running cold—at the look of his terrible eyes—`whose?'— `Mercer's!'— `What, have they slain him—how? tell me—I never shall forget him. I saw him but once or twice, but— I shall never forget his carriage or voice!'— `He had leaped to the ground, and was leading on his men to the charge, when, by some mistake in the evolution, he found himself a prisoner—surrendered, by the living God, I saw it! I saw him surrender!— I saw him throw down his sword—I had just escaped, with about twenty of my troop, from the cottage—yet before I could get to the spot, thirteen bayonets were in his noble heart!— He suddenly stopped—`why how is this? said he— `Arthur!—dear Arthur!—I have never seen that smile upon your broad forehead since—dear Arthur speak to me—are you wounded?—do you feel that it is mortal!'— Arthur shook his head—and a shadow went over his face— `What! so cheerful Arthur—and yet, unharmed—afar from the place of sleep—and quiet—and deep, deep loveliness and innocence.'— `Are you wounded, brother?' said I—seeing the blood bubble over the top of his tight boots, as he rose in the stirrups, or pressed upon them, with the movement of his mare— `Yes,' he replied, smiling—`yes, and if it were not to be a tedious affair, I should not be sorry if—if it should be seriously—or even—pardon me brother, but I cannot forbear the truth—even mortally'— `It is impious,' said I—`impious, Archibald: whatever is, is right.'— `True,' he replied, locking his hands—and reeling a little, in the saddle, `true brother—and God be praised, that, in the heat of battle—I remembered that, and thought of Him—Him the Everlasting—and felt that inexpressible awe and devotedness that—I cannot well express it—it was, in a measure, as if, to some one of his Angels, I had heard him give Washington in charge.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAP. X. “I never loved a tree nor flower, But 'twas the first to fade away.— `But I am strangely altered now— `I love no more the bugle's voice— `The rushing wave—the plunging prow— `The mountain's tempest-clouded brow— `The daring—the exulting flow `Of all that made me once rejoice!—' We had now been at Morristown four days—the enemy had fallen back, fold upon fold, coil upon coil, like some vast serpent, whose development had been suddenly checked by a furance.—My brother sent for me—and desired me to write a letter for him, which, he added, `you are to take, to-morrow, to its destination. The General has consented that you, with twenty picked men, shall convey Clinton to Mr. Arnauld's, and stay there for two weeks.—' `But will you not go?—can you not?'—said I, embracing him.— `No—I cannot, nor would I, if I could, except to see my mother. You will say to her, all that I could, and I shall give you a line or two.' `And Arthur—what shall be done with him?—You are too ill to keep up his spirits.' `You are mistaken: upon a sick bed—or the bed of death, men are apt to become very companionable. I am better company for Arthur than you. You are too happy—two blessed—and, of too steady and serene a heart for one that sorrows like Arthur Rodman.—But let us say no more of him—He will not leave me—he cannot. When will you set out?' VOL. I. 16 My heart beat hurriedly—stopped—beat again, with a sort of whirring motion, like a partridge rising. He smiled; but, after a moment's pause, added affectionately, `You are a stout hearted fellow, John—blood does not appal you, quiet-eyed as you are—the flash of musketry, the ring of bayonet and bullet, cannot disturb you —yet, man—there is what—' `Will eat the heart of valour through.' `You smile to hear me quote poetry at such a moment, but, so it is. Beware how you put yourself in the power of woman—no matter who she is—no matter how long you have known her—loved her—or been beloved, no matter how passionately—never put yourself in her power. But if you should—as you value your immortal happiness—your own, your dearest feeling, the concealed and pure—do not let her know it. The first is nearly death—the latter, worse than any death. It is dying of a trodden and scorned heart—a bruised and bleeding lip—a cancer of the soul.' I was unable to reply; for though, at another time, I should have rallied him upon such a display of peevishness and eloquence, because his heart had been roughly visited by the ungentle wind—yet my faculties had begun to fall down abashed before him, of late, whenever he opened his lips, and I was silent. `Give that to our mother,' said he—handing me a letter. I opened it and read as follows— `I do not pretend, my beloved mother—to pour any consolation into the widowed heart—nay, nor do I dare to attempt it. There is one Being, and only one, fitted for that office—the Father of the fatherless—the Husband of the widow. `But there is comfort for us. Our father died, foot to foot, face to face, with the enemy—red with the blood— of men, shed in sacrifice. `His hair—I cut from his temples with my own hand—the smell of the powder is yet upon it—it was scorched in the blaze, and washed with the heart-blood of the enemy. Remember that. `I do not pray the widow to be comforted—the wife to weep no more:—the mother, to forget the desolation, that is about her—but—O, my mother, let us turn our eyes upward—and lay our forehead in the dust—for whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth. `My father died, preparedly, in the loud thunder of battle. May his Children die like him!— `Farewell! `My own dear, dear mother, farewell! `ARCHIBALD.' `The other,' said he, as I finished, handing me that which is subjoined, `you are welcome to read.' `I fear, Lucia, that you have attributed too much importance to the language, of which I spoke, and to the word that I used, with no very scrupulous regard to the consequences. That Clinton spoke lightly, irreverently, disrespectfully of you, is true—but so would every man, that should speak of you, in my estimation I mean, unless he spoke of you, as something not lawful to be mentioned at all. I do not mean to flatter or deceive you. You know well what my feelings have been. They are changed. I love you now, as a sister;—and, as a brother would, parting with his sister, do I now address you. Clinton is dangerously ill; the army have gone into winter quarters, and here, where there are so few comforts, and none of that attention—that, which none but women, and women too that love, devotedly, tenderly, can bestow, if he remain, we may as well bid him farewell forever, at once. He is deeply troubled about you—altered, I do believe, essentially, in his habit of thinking. Have I any influence with you?—then let me entreat of you, my dear sister, to forget all that has past—all but your love to him, I mean; and be to him, his nurse and beloved one. Can you?—will you? No matter what he has been. You love him. No matter what he has done. You love him. All men have their faults; and, generally, in proportion to their virtues. Remember that, and, whatever of evil you may discover, or imagine, in his nature, be assured that there is a heroick quality at bottom to counterbalance it. What say you? you are not vindictive—nor are you light of heart, or irresolute. I have warned him not to look for easy terms. He thinks that he knows you better than I. He does not. He is mistaken. In some points, it is possible that he may; but, for your character, your character Lucia, there is no human being, not even your own father, that knows it so well as I. Nay, for I would disguise nothing from you; rash and precipitate as you are—I have prayed him to be prepared for the worst. He smiles—but his fine eyes fill, at the same time, when I tell him, that a reconciliation is by no means certain—that, an everlasting separation is, by no means, impossible.—He does not believe me. He cannot—for he knows not of what women, that love, are capable—and you, of all women. Lucia, had you been my wife—at the bidding of my hand, I know that you would have thrown yourself under the hoofs of a whole squadron—leaped from a precipice—into a furnace—into the sea. I know it—you may not believe it—he cannot, but I do. Yet, I know too, that were your nature roused to all its preternatural display, you would have done the same things, contrary to my bidding—prayers, and tears, and cries. `Forgive him Lucia—forgive him, for my sake, and be happy. For my sake. Am I presumptuous?—perhaps you may say so, to him, Lucia, while he is sitting by you, his strong arm about your slender waist, your soft voice murmuring upon his eye lids — — — no, no—I am wrong—you do not permit such things. He dare not, by heaven, he dare not embrace your waist, till—heaven hath bestowed you upon him forever. Dare he?—tell me Lucia—if he dare, you are lost. Yet what right have I to ask you—I?—who never dare to put my lips to your hand—I! who, when you opened your mouth, felt my heart stop, and the room grow dark with the rush of blood to my temples? `Am I presumptuous? tell me—as a brother, have I offended you? Tell me—I—' `Farewell—I would write forever—if it might be; but no!—you are another's already, in the sight of heaven—and I!—Well, well, may you be happy, very happy, sister. `Your friend and brother, `ARCHIBALD.' `P. S.—Clinton is the favorite of the camp—and astonished all eyes at the last affair but one. The whole army are loud in praise of his conduct, and intrepidity; it is said that, in the very heat and whirlwind of the fight, he was full of the same pleasantry that we have seen—Nay, I cannot, cannot, continue in this strain. It will break my heart. But—Sister —forgive him—forgive Clinton, and bless him?' `And would you send that?' said I —`Are you aware of the consequences? Clinton will certainly cut your throat, whether he marry her not.— He smiled, and shook his head, with a mournful, gentle sweetness of manner, that was new to me— `that,' said he, `will depend, in some measure, upon myself—and I have no particular inclination that way:'— Our horses were now at the door—Clinton in the litter; and, despatching five of my men in advance, to prepare the family for our reception, we set forward, and at the end of the second day, near sun set— while the western heaven was running together, like rough gold, and thin, drifting, blood-coloured vapour— we had just come in sight of the house, and were descending a steep hill—when, on lifting up his head for a moment, and throwing his eyes about, he appeared to recollect the place, for he motioned with his hand to stop—and beckoning to me, I came up to him. `It was there,' said he, `there, exactly where that horse is passing now, that they first fired upon me. I set off at speed up that hill, but, finding nine of the party there, I determined to dash over that elevation in front—I attempted it, but, shot after shot, was fired after me, until I preferred making one desperate attempt, VOL. I. 16* sword in hand, to being shot down, like a fat goose, upon a broken gallop. I wheeled, made a dead set, at the son-of-a-bitch in my rear, unhorsed him, and actually broke through the line. It was then that I first saw Archibald, and but for him —but no, I am not permitted to tell that—I have promised not to tell, that he saved my life, and brought down a fellow, at twenty yards, with a pistol ball, at full speed—and I am very scrupulous, very, about my word!—so, if you should ever hear of any such thing, you will do me the justice, to remember that I refused to tell you.' I smiled, and would have replied; but, just then, a loud bark at my feet, made me look down, and there was poor Fidele, a favourite dog of Lucia's, tumbling about in the light snow, and yelping like a devil. We had been descried, long before we approached—and found all the family, all that were able to meet us, for the first time, ready with glistening eyes, to meet us at the portico.— `Where is'—I would have uttered the name of Clara, but I could not. My heart sank in my bosom, —and my poor mother threw herself, sobbing violently, into my arms. She had heard the tale.—Her manner was enough to convince me of that; and, when I kissed off the tears from her shut eyes, and felt her strong heart beating against mine—I could have fallen upon my face before her, and wept aloud— `My dear—dear John!' said a sweet voice—and Mrs. Arnauld, flushed with beauty and emotion, embraced me—still—still, there was one absent—I rushed past them all—encountered a man in the passage—just took his hand in passing,—and felt that I was welcome indeed—it was Arnauld himself—and ran to where my heart told me, Clara was to be found. I entered—she attempted to arise from the window; but she could not —she staggered and fell. I put my lips—I did—and they thrilled, as if they had touched a coal of fire— to her blessed mouth—before she had sufficiently recovered to reprove me. A haughty flash went over her brow—her eyelids fell—a colour, deeper than any crimson, it was a transparent flame, followed—and then —after looking me in the face for half a minute, she sank gradually upon her knees—and remained there for a minute, in unutterable humility and thankfulness.—She arose then—and when I sat down, overpowered by the deep tumult in my own heart, the proud Clara stood by me, and suffered my arm—by heaven she did—to encircle her waist, and press her bosom to my forehead, as I sat—without any other reproof, than that of laying her hand gently upon my head—and murmuring `I am satisfied!' For the first time, I turned pale; for the first time, I remembered her letter. `What could she have meant? I asked her; but she smiled, and her glistening eyes, swam anew—`I am satisfied!' she repeated. `You are returned to me. And you have dared to put your lips to mine—you are innocent—she is innocent.'— `She!—who!—who is innocent?'— `Lucia.'— `Lucia!' I echoed, colouring to the temples, I am sure, and trembling under the touch of her soft hand— Her beautiful eyes stopped all at once—her lip quivered a moment, and, as if—in spite of all her confidence in me and Lucia—the emotion that I betrayed, had been a natural confirmation of all that she feared, her hand, gradually, and without design, slid powerless from my forehead, and rested upon my shoulder.— I put mine upon it—it was cold as death, yet I felt it beat unsteadily.—`Lucia,' said I, `dear Clara,' recovering my self-possession, and drawing her more closely to my breast—`speak to me, dearest—what have I done?'— It was a long time, a long breathless time, before she could utter a sound, and when she did—for a moment, all the hushed sorrow of her heart, came out with it, and she sobbed aloud upon my bosom.— And then—as if that were the last, last weakness, of which she was ever to be guilty—she released herself, with a firm hand, from my arms—retreated a pace or two—fixed her eye steadily upon mine—and, when she saw them sink, as they did, abashed before hers, would have left me,—probably forever—had I not detained her by violence. `What would you?' said she, severely: `Have you any defence?—any?— I was fully sensible now that—no time was to be lost—but how could I speak of what I had seen—how account for the fact, that Lucia had opened the door, at the first tap—how—shame on me, I was so disordered by the beautiful apparition before me—so full of tumult and delight, notwithstanding her fearful wildness—that I forebore to urge any defence,—willing, heaven forgive me—to prolong the enjoyment awhile—and a little provoked too, (though fluttered by her jealousy) at the imperious severity of her bearing. Would you believe it—this artificial embarrassment of mine continued so long, that I could not open my lips at last, and stood before her, like a guilty creature--- nay---when she moved away from me---I had neither the power to arrest, nor detain her, with hand or voice, or supplication. Nay—she was gone—absolutely gone, before I was sufficiently master of myself, to be sensible of what had happened; and when I was, it was with a feeling of pettishness, as if I had been ill treated—and there mingled with it, immediately, the ancient leaven of my nature, and I struck my hands together, and swore as I had ten years before—to bring down her proud spirit to the dust.— How long I stood so---I know not---but I know well, that I had matured my plan, before I stirred, or breathed; and felt sure that, as my innocence was in my own keeping, the proof of it, always at hand, and that, as I could restore myself whenever I pleased, to the place that I might appear to have lost, in her affection,—by a single word —I—How long I might have continued in the deep revery that followed, I know not—had I not heard a soft foot passing over the apartment on tip toe—in the further end of it, where it was so dim, with the twilight lustre of evening, that a body would have appeared like a spirit. I knew the step---every pause---every foot fall---every accent---and was already planning a triumphant expression of my countenance, for the haughty girl--- when she stopped---and I could hear her breathe, as if her heart were full.—I stood more erect, without turning about or appearing to heed her approach— Gracious Heaven! how readily the heart may be deceived. The apparition—a beautiful little creature—with hair, the colour of raw silk---very light blue eyes, dancing in tears—was not Lucia Arnauld!—O, no— I caught my breath, and she—overcome with confusion, and trembling nevertheless, addressed me after the following fashion— `I pray you, Mr. Rodman—I---bless me! don't look at me so---you terrify me—I pray you—I--- pshaw! I never could make a set speech in all my life, except to the giddy creatures about me---I have something to tell you---I know you---knew you before I came here---have wept for you---dont let that flatter you---I've wept for many men---before---and blushed for hundreds---and laughed at thousands, so—as I was a saying---I've---yes! I've wept about you, not for you---did I say for you---Lord! how you stare at a fellow!— In truth I did stare at her—her roguish little face ---parted lips, and spirited eyes---her very attitude, was so full of comical expression---the very manner, in which her pretty little foot, with a broad paste buckle, rested in advance, as she leant toward me, was full of coquetry, frolick and expression— `There's my hand,' said she---`take it, if you dare. You are very wicked, I see you are---any body might know it by your face—now tell me---are you an honest man?' In spite of myself, I fell into her humour---`upon my honour I am!' said I---and took her hand, and would have carried it to my lips, but she caught it away, with a look of angry surprise, and measured me from top to toe, like an insulted princess. `Well---well---(shrugging her shoulders) O! the taste of some people---and---then!---the impudence of others—a melancholy desolate creature—ha!—ha! ha! ha!—' She would have left me, but I detained her—and she stood wiping her hand where I had touched it, as if a snake had crawled over it—her red lip agitated like a transparent rose leaf, with an insect under it—`Sir, you are not the man that I expected to find you—you never deserved such a blessed creature; it would be a sin and a shame to tell you—but my heart will burst, and you know it—I see it plainly, by your saucy eyes— if I don't tell you—I—I—are you sure that you are the same Arthur that—' I grew serious, immediately, aware of some unaccountable mistake— `O yes!—that now—that will do!—Look so, till I have told you all about it; and, if your wicked heart dont leap out of your body, you are—I wont say what —I haven't mentioned your name, since I've been here,—I was afraid to—asked no questions—waited till I could see you—but how came she to fancy you —you a melancholy creature!---pho, pho,---you are ready to laugh in my face, at this moment---arn't you?' `Yes'—I replied---nodding— `How long do you remain here?'—said she. `Two or three days, perhaps.—`But stop---for whom do you take me?—' `For whom do I take you?—a pretty question—for Arthur Rodman, the talk of the whole country---the lover of—' `I cannot hear you another moment,' I replied---I am not Arthur Rodman—' `Not Arthur Rodman!---she cried, turning deadly pale—`pray, (recovering herself, and curtseying) who the devil are you?'— `Jonathan Oadley—otherwise John'---she started back three paces, and dropped another profound curtsey— `And who the devil are you?' said I--- `Ellen Sampson—otherwise Nell'---she replied— I gazed at her, with a strange feeling of astonishment, delight and terrour---might she not be mad? The troubled beauty of her pale blue eyes---their delirious brightness---the intensely vivid red of her lips---just parting playfully, her white teeth, glittering within them, like---like---by heaven there never was any thing so white, as they appeared to me, for a moment, contrasted with the gushing crimson of her swollen lips---the etherial, eager delicacy of her attitude. Really she stood like some creature of the bright element, just emerging for a moment, upon the tranced eyes of some one, that had been gazing, till he was blinded, upon the setting sun.— `Ellen—'said I—`I—' `Upon my word! you don't breathe often, I imagine; hush, hush, not another step. I am glad to find that you are not Arthur Rodman, because I could not, giddy as I am, bear to see—'(swinging her arms, and clapping her little hands, before and behind her, while her tongue ran as fast as she could speak, and her bright hair danced like a quivering halo about her head, at every swing— and the tears ran out of her eyes full gallop—at the same moment)—`bear to see—a creature like him, after such a deplorable a— a— O hang it, I can't talk about it—but if Arthur Rodman had kissed my hand, he never should have heard another syllable of the matter'— `I suppose not,' said I; laughing—attempting to catch her arm— `Hands off, Pompey—Arthur Rodman, I said—not Jonathan Oadley; what a name!-----Lord, I should, die a------haven't you some other name?—what do they call you, when they are not laughing at you, nor angry, nor— `John—' `Well then, John. Do you love Arthur?' `Of a truth,' said I— `I believe you,' she cried—skipping about, and looking at her delicate feet, all the time, as if they belonged to any body but herself—`let me see you cut a pigeon wing—pho, pho! in this way, I mean—take care—why, John—that's your name, you know—you dance like a man a-skaiting.' All this while, she was practising her steps, before me, just as if we had been brought up together, all our lives; but she suddenly stopped, tripped up to me— stood a moment on tip toe, about a foot from my face— staring me in the eyes— `I know what you are thinking now, just as well— as well as if I were in your own heart---mind!---you think I'm a fool, I am not, (laying it down with her little fore finger, very emphatically)—I am not. You think me crazy. You are mistaken. What did they bring me here for?---to mope in the corner---kill spiders---pinch the girls---and cry my eyes out?------ Stop---come here------there is somebody listening---now mind me---' My heart fluttered again---I remembered, all at once, how Clara had left me------and I could have wept with shame and vexation------ `I have something to tell you about Arthur—nobody knows it but myself, you shall know it, if you'll be good —so—when shall I see you again—as you live, don't disappoint me---hush---hush.' `To-morrow evening, at the same hour---in the same place,' said I, hardly knowing what I had said------ `Bye now,' she replied---`bye! John'---shaking her hand, with affected awkwardness, like a fat infant, `day-day!' She had been gone ten minutes, before I recovered my senses; and, when I did, there was a strange sensation at my heart that I had never experienced before--- a restless, dissatisfied, aching spirit. I determined to pursue Clara; but it was already so dark, that I could not, and I descended------Merciful heaven! I had forgotten my own mother. Oh! shame on the profligate heart of her son, a gray haired mother---widowed and broken of heart, had been forgotten, by her first born. I ran to her. I found her, troubled with my arrival, and expecting me, in a remote apartment, hovering over a dim fire, like something unearthly, her withered hands pressed upon her temples, and her eyes looking through her disturbed hair, as if they had been turned to stone. `Mother, dear mother!' I cried, throwing myself upon her neck. She suffered my embrace, without any apparent emotion, and then put me aside, and stood, her stately form, once eminent for beauty and stature, unbowed, unbent, with the pressure of all her woes---and rivetted her old eyes upon the dark entry, which could be seen through the door that I left open, as if she expected some other, —what other, I know not—to follow me. I was afraid to interrupt her---and, after a moment, in which she stood, like a priestess, about to receive some preternatural augmentation of power---she shook her head mournfully, turned to me, bared my forehead with both hands, looked into my eyes for a moment, and then, gradually, gradually, her face wrought up to such unutterable horrour, the blood flashing over her forehead, and the light streaming from her eyes---that I could not endure it—I covered my face with my hands and shook from head to foot. `Aye, shake, shake!' she cried--`the tree was uptorn, the old man shattered---and, and, O! my dear dear, boy' ---(falling upon my bosom and sobbing like a child)— where have you been? I did not know you for awhile, where is father? some how or other, my son, I have not remembered of late that---ha! Archibald? I started, as if Archibald himself had stood before me. It was Lucia---but O, how altered! I went to her, and took her hand. God bless her! God forever bless her! she was a ministering angel to my poor old mother, kind to her all the day long, watching by her, and nursing her, while her own heart VOL. I. 17 was breaking, till her beauty had waned, and her wonderful eyes were dim with the death dew. I was unable to speak—and she then bore the silver cup to my mother, holding upon my hand, as upon that of her last friend. `Poor dear Lucia,' said my mother, putting her old arms about her white glittering neck—`he will never return.' Lucia shuddered; but I—I—immediately exclaimed; `do not believe her, Lucia, he will return—he has returned, he is here at this moment.' I thought only of Clinton. Madman that I was!—my mother' sarms dropped— and she stood for a moment, as if the spectre of my father had started up, all at once, before her. And Lucia—O, she shut her eyes, and pressed her two hands upon her heart, as if it were bursting—just whispering, so audibly that I could barely hear the words. `Heaven forbid—O, heaven forbid!—here,—Archibald! O, heaven forbid.' It was some minutes, before I could command myself sufficiently to prepare her for the arrival of Clinton, after having undeceived her,—but she cut me short at once, with a sweet mournful smile—her breast heaving at the same moment piteously, and, as if the swell would never, never subside—`I saw your brother,' said she, firmly. I stood, holding her hands, but, struck by the strange solemnity of her manner, as she said this, I dropped them—`what do you mean, Lucia?' I said, leading her to a seat. She sat down, my mother on the one side of her— watching every emotion of her pale, beautiful face—as if for life and death—while I sat listening like one disturbed in his own senses. `I always lock my room—of late' said she, (faltering and averting her eyes)—`I locked it last evening. About this time—or about an hour before—I returned, and found it locked—yet the shape of a man was sitting at the further window, with his face leaning upon his hand. I could not be mistaken; it was Archibald—I know not what followed—I attempted to stagger to him, but a sudden sickness of the heart, giddiness and blindness followed, I—ah—that's Ellen's voice— another time, my friend—I am very sad, very heavy at the heart, another time—dear mother, what can I do for you?' I was yet unwilling to leave to another, a duty so perilous as mine—that of announcing the arrival of Clinton, wounded, and perhaps mortally, under the same roof of this passionate girl; and had revolved, again and again, a hundred methods of doing it, without startling her too abruptly, asking myself how they had kept it a secret from her alone? and waiting to hear her mention his name. But we were interrupted. `Colonel Clinton will not lie down—he swears he will not, child, till you run to him'—said Ellen Sampson, skipping in— Lucia arose calmly, and said—`then will I go to him. Miss Sampson, Mr. Oadley.' I was amazed, and struck at her tone. Where was that inward depth, that impassioned musick, that, to have heard once would set your heart thrilling—the very vibration of which, upon the ear, convinced you, with a speed like electricity, that she who spoke, loved, and loved desperately—where was it now?—My eyes filled, before I knew it, and when she put back her raven tresses, and departed, with the air of something regal, in sorrow—and, I may as well speak it, for so it appeared to me, in humiliation—I did involuntary homage to her, by bowing my body, and almost touching my forehead to the floor. They departed—and my dear mother's eyes were already heavy. She kissed me, affectionately—and putting her head upon the pillow, slept, as she sat, leaning against the bed, while I stood over her. The supper bell rang—and in following the sound, I encountered, successively, a little lame old man—a savage looking boy—Mr. Arnauld—a stranger, who was afterwards a source of great comfort to me—Mrs. Arnauld, and, all but Clara. `She will not appear,' said I, to myself, `she would lose her self-possession; she knows it, and dare not trust herself.' How little I knew her. Before we were seated, she entered the room, with a firm step— a little paler, I thought, than usual—but very firm, as if nothing had happened. I observed that all eyes were upon us, and I faltered out her name, bowing. She returned it. `Why! how is this?' said her mother, colouring— `I—' `We have already met,' said Clara, endeavouring to smile, but carefully avoiding to meet my eyes. It soon came to my share—but why tell such things? our supper was comfortless, and I—I was wretched— yet stung to the quick, angry with myself and provoked at the composure of Clara. My Children—these were trifles only—but beware of trifles. A light blow, the lightest, may render a priceless jewel, of less value than the dust beneath your feet. To them that love, little matters are important—important ones, little. Hearts that could bear to be torn assunder by death—smitten with palsy, when they had grown together—bruised and trodden on—without bleeding—will madden at the petty exasperations of life; a little neglect, a little unkindness will be death— because, they reason wisely—a little unkindness is the failure of only a little kindness—and who can pardon the omission to do, what may be done with so little trouble? It is these little things which show most directly, the alienation—habitual alienation, and antipathy of the heart. Remember my words. And remember my story. 'Tis the last drop, that runs over; the last breath that starts the ship—the last word that breaks the heart. After supper, we collected, all—with my dear mother, around a blazing fire. Even Clinton was trundled out, perilous as it would seem, and sat as near, as might be, to Lucia. Her lashes were wet, and he would have held her hand, as he leaned his noble face upon the high cushion at his side—pale as that of a dead man, but with a beautiful timidity, as he thought, for I could see his fine eyes sparkle through the half shut lashes—though I thought it another, and more awful feeling. She withdrew her hand, twice from his, without looking him in the face; and, each time, there was a dark convulsion passed over the lower part of her face, like a spasm— perhaps a contraction of the heart. The ideot boy, for so he appeared to me, sat, on a low stool in the very corner; his wolfish eyes, blood shot and wandering, incessantly glancing about, like those of some wild animal at the sight of fire. He sat bent nearly double—licking his knuckles continually with his enormous tongue; and his sprawling hands, and red wrist, which in consequence of his shirt sleeves, and the position in which he sat, at times, holding upon his knees, and rocking two and fro all the while—appeared more like the claws of some monster, than the hands of a boy. His teeth were very large, and of a dazzling whiteness, so that, when he smiled—which was very rarely, or spoke, which was still more rare, there was something very frightful in his appearance. Had such a creature started out, suddenly, upon me, in a lone wood, I should have shot him dead upon the spot, without asking any question, I am sure; and even now, when I saw him, pouting his dark lips, and licking them, as he looked at Clara and Lucia by turns, I could not forbear shuddering, and, with a curdling horrour and heat of my blood, recalling the story of baboons and ourang outangs, who had carried off the planters women—even to the top of inaccessable rocks and trees. Nay, though my nature is not blood thirsty— and the sight of human blood, at any time, will give me; to this day, a convulsive start, and sickness like death—yet, I really felt uneasy in the presence of this obscene and abominable shape; and wanted to strangle him. VOL. I. 17* His sister saw me watching him, and probably read the expression of my countenance, for she coloured— rivetted her pretty eyes upon me, and shook her head, saying audibly—`you are mistaken.' I started—coloured, I suppose, and fell into another revery— Near her, with his lame leg swathed in red flannel, and lying on a cushion before him, sat her father, Mr. Amos, David, Sampson—his sharp, pimpled face looking as if the blood were about to start through it—his little gooseberry eyes shining sideways, through lashes like a wisp of hay, at every speaker in succession; and his lips moving, all the while, as if he were gnawing the inside of them—a snappish, disagreeable old gentleman as one could desire to meet with—so I thought. `You are mistaken,' said the same voice—again. And when I lifted my eyes, in some confusion, I confess, for it had not occurred to me that, as I sat, with my hand over my face, under pretence of shading it from the great lamp just over my head, studying all the faces about me, that another eye was studying mine, if not my heart also, at the same moment—with unsparing accuracy too. I was in the middle of the circle, leaning upon a heavy round mahogany table, which ereaked aloud at every movement. Near me, bolt upright, in a suit of thunder and lightning, as it was called, a material of domestick manufacture, of different colours, and woven clouded, then much in use; with a long red waistcoat, and a cocked hat, too small for his head, which, it was said he had worn night and day for half a century—sat a tall, thin gentleman, all legs and arms, it appeared to me —who, as I afterwards observed, had the pleasantest way in the world of tacking his thoughts together, and recompounding all the disordered fragments that others happened to throw away—with an infinite variety, like a kaleidescope—without ever turning his head—smiling, or winking. His eyes were rivetted upon a picture that hung over the fire place, which, I was told, he had been in the habit of studying, with precisely the same expression, for a week at a time (his visit never lasting more than a week) during nearly sixteen years. He was an ancient friend of the family—and had been so long accustomed to eating, what he called, his Christmas dinner, at Mr. Arnauld's, that he began to regard it as a sort of annuity, to be paid when wanted; and it was therefore no uncommon thing for him to stalk into the room, in the middle of the dog days, without stirring a muscle, and announce his intention of eating his Christmas dinner with them, which meant—boarding with them for a week or ten days. I had been prepared for his manner—but no preparation could have prevented me from feeling surprise. He talked all the while, like a man in his sleep—or one conversing with spirits, always in the same tone, without emphasis, accent or modulation; and to the last hour of his visit, he could not have told the subject of that very picture, upon which he had gazed so long— nay, when it was turned once, with the backside out, (in consequence of a death in the family,) he never appeared to observe the change—yet, while studying it, his eyes would wander from one side to the other, and involuntarily adopt the expression of them that were painted, so that a stranger would take him to be the profoundest of connoisseurs. `You are mistaken!' said the same voice. I almost started from my seat. How could I be mistaken? was it not evident that she was mad, her brother a fool, and a beast—evil as evil could be; her father a most cholerick, wicked old fellow, and Dr. Hastings a earned, pedantick, disordered simpleton? such were my convictions. But, I will try to give you as well as I can remember it, a part of our conversation on that evening, which I shall never forget, and leave you to judge for yourselves. To save the constant repetition of said he, and said she—I shall give the names at first, of each speaker, as in a dialogue. Arnauld—(turning slowly about, so as to front my face, and occasionally watch the change in that of Clinton)—`well young man'—you have seen powder burnt seriously again? what will be the effect, think you?' Mr Sampson. `Of what? seeing powder burnt? make the young dogs too saucy—no living with t'em, the rascals—make my house too hot for them:' Young Nick showed his teeth, and rubbed his hands, when his father said this. Mrs. Arnauld. `O, my dear Mr. Sampson, caro amico ---too severe, too severe indeed—these young men ought to be admired, welcomed every where—it is they that protect our daughters, and—' Mr. Sampson. `Humph.' Mrs. Arnauld. `In short, Mr. Sampson, but for them —O, you are much too severe, beaucoup, beaucoup—' (pronouncing the final consonant---) while the husband bit his lips, Lucia dropped her eye lids, and saw my mother's lips move, as if she were trying to repeat the word to herself. `The battle of Trenton, battle of Princeton—ancora una volta, only think; while all the young men of the country were flying away from their deliverer, Washington, the great—le grand (pronouncing it lee grand) as we call him abroad; and you are all about your fire side, bonvivyans—our young men, sword in hand— nay, our old men, fell upon the enemy—God bless me! I beg ten thousand pardons,' (running to my mother, who had fallen back in the chair, without motion.) Nell—`This would be well enough, Aunt—mighty well, but, now and then, some worsted Colonel' (her brother's teeth chattered, and he peered through his black hair at the Colonel, and chuckled, good naturedly I confess)—but, curse his teeth, they made my blood run cold (I could think of nothing but a young Cannibal, tearing human flesh,) `a teasing lieutenant, comes down upon us peaceable creatures, and carries all before him.' Mrs. Arnauld. `By a koop dee mane----cappo di disperazzione.' Mr. Arnauld. `Coup de main, my dear, if wholesome English won't do', (shifting his position)--`disperatsione.' Nell. `Aunt---did you ever learn French?----or Italian?' Lucia. `Cousin!' Clara. (Turning her eyes full upon her, in silence.) `My mother, Ellen, is---pray dear Ellen, what think you of a sleigh ride? to-morrow afternoon.' Ellen. `Afternoon! what time?' Lucia. `Toward evening.' Ellen. `O, yes'---clapping her hands---`O, yes! of all things in this world---a sleigh ride---O, — — no---no--no, bless me, I can't, I can't—I'm engaged.' Mr. Sampson. `The devil you are! to whom.' Young Nick. `To that chap,' (nodding at me.) Mr. Arnauld turned, and looked at the boy, and then at me, and then at Ellen, who coloured all over. Here Doctor Hastings began to mutter to himself, gradually raising his voice at intervals, until it became sufficiently audible for us to distinguish---the words, `odd fish---battle like that! poor creature! Caro amico; wounded--very good—no, no, could'nt bear it, engaged! bless me---so young, very bloody, very. Arnauld. `Gentlemen,' his deep mellow voice coming, as it were, from the most inward place of his whole heart---while it fell, drop after drop, like molten iron upon my own---and, if I might judge by the compressed lips of Clinton, whose face was in shadow—into his also, while, it was evident that Mr. Arnauld did not wish to be understood by others. `Gentlemen—the man who goes out to fight the battles of his country, loaded down with prayer and benediction—he, who goes out to bare his bosom to the bayonet and bullet, should have a clear heart as well as a stout one. Wo to him, wo to him! if the wail of innocence be ringing in his ears; if the curse of the widow hath fallen upon his heart—and wo to him, ten thousand times over, if the hand of a brother or a father be ever placed upon the hilt. There are men— not many, it is to be hoped—beautiful as Apollo, their hearts breaking out, as it would seem, at every word that they utter—men that, trespassing rudely upon the innocent and lovely—the generous and noble, would dare—oh, there have been such men! and there may be more of them—whose word is death—whose approach is dishonour—men, that would dare, in the wanton revelry of their spirit, to tread upon naked hearts, yes—drive their very horses over the torn bosoms and trodden beauty of woman—that they might have it to tell of, when they had escaped the wrath of the abused father—or—' I dared not look up—there was a mortal silence— but somebody, I felt sure, was dying near me; and when I turned, I saw the face of Lucia buried in Clara's lap—one hand held in Clinton's, as if to assure him, that he had no share in this—his eyes flashing fire— and himself trying, in vain, to arise and walk out of the room, as if to order his horse. Poor Mrs. Arnauld, there, sat like one struck with thunder, at the moment of song and dance—entreating him, almost on her knees, not to move—the ideot boy's eyes, glistening with tears, and his lip writhing—his father quivering all over like a stud horse reined in, too long, while the trumpet was blowing—Clara sitting upright, pale as death— The silence that followed, was unbroken—till, in a soft distant voice—as if to change the conversation, Ellen demanded, if any of the company had ever heard of a man in the neighbourhood, by the name of Frederick Crawford— The answer was general and immediate—but the change of expression, in the face of Arnauld was instantaneous and terrible. He turned his searching eyes upon Ellen; but, either she had no meaning in the question, or she had a wonderful self command, for her countenance did not change in the least—but his! —heaven and earth! the sweat burst out upon his forehead—his dark luminous eyes, were suddenly quenched, as if in blood—and several times, he attempted to put his hands to his throat, while gasping for breath, but they fell, several times, powerless, into his lap—with every symptom of a fit. His wife was inconceivably terrified—and a general bustle took place, till he quelled it, sternly, by asking Ellen, if she knew `aught of Crawford?—' `Yes'—she replied, innocently—`yes uncle, I know that he is a scoundrel.' Arnauld's face became livid—but he added—`Do you know him,—who he is,—or what?—' `Who he is!' answered Ellen, her face changing, all at once to horrour, as she caught his eyes—and her lips turning white—while she came near him, and said— `yes uncle, I do know him, now.' Clara, I observed, was writing—and the next moment, with a sweet, noble composure, she handed a slip of paper to me, on which was written as follows— `Treat me as usual. My father knows nothing— but he is all awake. Do not stay long.—Farewell! I have given you an opportunity. I shall never give you another. You could not deny it. I respect your honesty.' I looked at her, but it was impossible to catch her eye—and Clinton, just then, put his hand into mine, giving it a fervent pressure—`Let us go,' said he— `Yes,' I replied, `with all my heart.—The sooner the better.' `What means this, young men?' said Arnauld— `Beware how you trifle with an old man. Do not be rash. Things done in a breath, a whole life has been too little to atone for. `Clinton!' said Lucia—rising, with a beautiful undauntedness, and standing before him. `I see by your eyes, what you meditate. You are wrong. If you have any regard for us—for me—for me—I entreat you to stay.' The mother joined in the persuasion, and Clara and Ellen.— `And you'—said Clara, to me---`you have been very dear to us'--- `Have been,' said I---in a low voice---`since when Clara?'---She trembled in replying--- `You, will not surely return, till you are wanted in camp! There was an accent of kindness---affectionate entreaty in her voice, that almost brought tears into my eyes; but a temper, a new temper, had uprisen in my heart, stubborn as death, implacable as hell—one that I never had dreamt of—and I replied— `I shall go to-morrow at day break.—' `At day break!'—said Ellen—running up to me--- `you are a pretty fellow?---is this the way you keep your promise?---I 'spose you'll come back, again by sunset.---' Clara, before she knew it, glanced at me, and then at Ellen, as if doubting the evidence of her own senses---but she disdained to speak, and I was far too haughty to explain. I turned to go---but Mr. Arnauld interfered---`My friends,' said he, with great solemnity, `what the meaning of all this affair is, I cannot pretend to imagine. But I am jealous of appearances. Sleep this night, quietly under my roof, and go away to-morrow, with God's blessing upon your head. Whatever happen--- I will never pursue, nor molest, nor thwart you---He hath taught me humility, and forbearance. But go to night---to night, Clinton---to night, Oadley---and at the risk even of his displeasure---I will pursue you--- till I am at the bottom of the whole---yea, to the furthermost extremities of the earth---and then---if there be aught that a father could not bear to see, or hear--- that father's blood, you shall be wet with---or he shall wash his hands in that of your hearts.' `Let us go,' said Clinton, composedly. `No mercy, Clinton, no mercy!' cried the distracted Lucia, falling upon her knees before him—`O, do not go.' `Is there any hope?' said Clinton, tenderly—putting his hand upon her shoulder, while her father stood, as if irresolute whether to trample her down, upon the spot, and complete her degradation, or to uplift her, and curse him to his heart. `Any, for the man that you have loved?' `None---' said Lucia, recovering herself, and standing up, while her sweet voice came, like an echo issuing from her heart. `Before you came to me, you knew it. You pretended to know me—no, Clinton, no! there is no hope—I cannot deceive you. I have loved you—I love you no longer, but I cannot hate you—I cannot hate the man that — — Clinton! look me in the face, do not deceive yourself—there is no hope for you—not even that which now thrills at the bottom of your heart. Remember—remember! nothing that can happen will bring me back to love — — Are you a man? Forget me. Are you a man? Do not leave this house in anger. I appeal to your heart. You have done that —that, for which there is no reparation—heaven forgive you—I do forgive you! (putting her hand in his) From my soul, I forgive you, and pity you. You have done that— do not leave us in anger. Remember our love.' `Mr. Arnauld,' said Clinton—Sending away the cloth from his bosom, his eyes gushing out for the first time, in all his life, with unutterable love, and tears and tenderness, while he leaned, against the high chair. `Strike! drive your sword through my heart---up to the hilt---I desire it—I—' `Clinton!' said Lucia, dropping her arms— He saw her eyes, bowed, turned away his face, and buried it in his hands. `I cannot go to night—Oadley, I cannot— Clara—' I looked at her, and half extended my hand, but there was no correspondent motion in her—and my countenance darkened, particularly when I heard her say to her sister—`Lucia will not want for consolation; where hearts are readily won, or lost'—it was bitterly said, and alluded, I knew, to the unhappy errour in which she was, respecting the night interview. `Before you go,' said Ellen—looking strangely serious for awhile—`I would say a word to you—father shall I go into the dark entry with him.' `Certainly Nell—he will be more hurt, by a dozen, than you—coxcomb!' VOL. I. 18 She led me out, and requested me (giving me a card) when I went to Philadelphia, to inquire at a house in Sixth-street, for a person, where I would hear of something to my advantage. `Can I trust to you,' said I—`your countenance is full of mischief.' `To me,' said she, facing to the light, when I found it all in tears. `I will trust to that,' I exclaimed, `farewell!' `You shall first go in, and bid farewell, and sit an hour with them, it is early.' I consented—and, though our first conversation was very embarrassing, and the latter part restrained and startling, yet it was full of patience, passion, and deep feeling—every word told. The chattering of the boy awoke me from a revery, and I found him listening, with evident delight, and a good humoured expression, to Dr. Hastings, in which delight even his father appeared to participate, with a pleasantry of eye, that led me to distrust the suddenness of my first judgment. The Doctor preserved, precisely, the same attitude, now, that he first sat down in; his long legs sprawled out at their utmost length, nearly divided that part of the room from the rest, and though each of us had stumbled over them in turn, yet, the Doctor appeared as insensible of all that had happened, as if they were none of his, and he had been sleeping in a mill---for he woke not, till the noise stopped, and then, for a moment he would start, look a little askew, as if all were not right—and then, as if, right or wrong, it was no matter of his, would relapse again, into the same audible revery— in somewhat after this fashion. `Odds fish! up to the hilt—poor creature, poor creature, if men could only content themselves with (here his voice died entirely away, and he pursued the question, and finished the sentence in his own mind) ---`odds fish! women will have them---odds fish---not go to night---forbearance! good! hand grenade, lighted in a powder magazine---set—odds fish! what a talking---always said, that drift wood—very cold, very cold indeed. Christmas. Pho, nonsense. Not so--- not so---Sir, that marble! (the chimney piece was a beautiful marble—the colours rushing together), fire, metals all in fusion, see it, hear it. I can assure you that, having prepared the precipitate and—Lord! lord! what a profligate---worsted Colonels! excellent, that horse, no—poh, poh, no--split in the off shoulder, split? split peas, split wood, split heads, split! split, same word, good night, bless me! all alone!' As he concluded this soliloquy, he turned his head to the left, where the room was all vacant and desolate; and he supposed, it is probable, that he had been left alone, nor would he have soon discovered the mistake, had not the boy turned his chair round, while he kept on with his soliloquy---so that he could see such of us as were yet left. But enough of this. I was mistaken in all their characters. The boy was neither a beast nor a devil, but a singularly active, shrewd young dog, the father, an old fellow of singular pleasantry, and Dr. Hasting's, with no more learning or pedantry than my boot jack ---so much for rash judgments, and Ellen; but of her hereafter. Clinton and I slept together, in the same room. His manly nature could support him no longer---he loved truly and devoutly now; and, with the true feeling of all men, the more truly and devoutly, in proportion as the object of his love seemed more, and more, implacable and distant. He wept aloud---feigning, whenever he could no longer suppress his sobbing, to cough---the consequence of which was, that, in the morning, when I was ready to mount my horse, poor Clinton was delirious. What could I do?—I was not delirious—and I left the house, as I said I would—at break of day--O— heaven! with what different emotions, from those, with which I entered it the last night, or left it before. Clinton was delirious, and I left him: committing him to the family, and leaving one servant with him— almost desiring, in the bitterness of my spirit, that he might die, under their inhospitable roof, and I—I!— that I might never meet, hear of, nor see Clara again— Clara! for whom I would have laid down my life at that moment!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. `Go then! if e'er we meet again, perhaps, `I may be worthier of you—and—if not, `Remember that my faults, though not atoned for, `Are ended.' Sardanapalus. The day was just breaking, when I mounted my horse. The whole eastern sky was of a blood red, through which an intermittent flashing of pale flame— thin and beautifully faint, was kept up;—while all the broad circumference of heaven, was rolling, like a dark ocean, except just where the red sun, like a great furnace, gave out an awful, troubled brightness, with a white rolling vapour—that mounted up, just over the hill tops, and then rushed away toward the western horizon, as if driven there before a high wind. I rode onward, hardly willing to look into my own heart for the motive which made me avoid the road that kept longest in sight of the house; and only pausing once to look at it—as it came, by a sudden turn in the way almost in front of me. I rested then, and, perhaps the keen wind had done it—I felt my eyes smarting; my heart too, (perhaps it was the mountain air, and the deep snow,) labouring as in travail, with one continual, uninterrupted throe. It was not to be borne —I had outridden my men, already; but here, regardless of the steep perilous roads, (which, I assure you, was far more so, than that by which Putnam once escaped—I have seen them both since—and I assure you, that I would not ride down this, a second time, as I did the first, for all this world—and that I would ride down that, where Putnam did, at any time, for a mere trifle— VOL. I. 18* That was a foolish, but not a perilous feat of his—but mine was that of a madman, as well as a fool,—I struck spurs into my horse, and went down, with such terrible speed, that I lost my breath—and should infallibly have been dashed to pieces, had not the snow been soft, as well as deep—so that, at every plunge, my horse went into it breast high. And, as I live—I touched the crupper with my back, all the way down—and my feet were on each side of his head. This could not last long, and I was recalled to a sense of my inhumanity and rashness, by seeing the white snow tinged all along my route, with the blood that had gushed out, hot and smoking from the lacerated flanks of my horse---and my men almost in the clouds, as it appeared to me, in the momentary glimpse that I had of them, reining their horses—as if they were near the brow of a precipice; and leaning forward over their necks, to see by what miracle I should escape. I was fain to dismount; and it was a full hour before I got into the level country again—a part of which time, my mind was meditating, with a profound melancholy sorrow and haughtiness, on all that had occurred —nor—for, it is no light object with me, my dear children, to make you familiar with all the working of my heart—nor can I deny that there was a brief warring, for a moment or two—when the golden haired Ellen—and the pale, princely Clara came into competition. I had heard much of the doctrine of election— in theology, I had found it to mean—something that was intelligible to them, to whom nothing else was intelligible—in law, the right of harassing a poor devil more ways than one; in love, much the same thing. But here was a case of no ordinary difficulty. Had it been one of the black vapours of theology— I should have peopled it, immediately with beautiful shapes—a question of law—for I was unfortunate enough to have an uncle for a lawyer, of whom, I will here take an occasion to relate an anecdote—I should have been quieted at once:—He was a surly, strong minded man, educated in the courts of Westminster Hall; and used to say—`John—Clients are gamblers. The spirit of litigation is the spirit of gambling. Once provoke it, and the devil can't lay it. Once get a man into Court; and, no matter how he is used—he will go there again—if he lose, to retrieve his loss—if he win, to win again. A man wrote me a letter once, to this effect—he was worth a hundred pounds a year to me— and about half that to his family—they starved—his creditors starved—but his lawyers were sure to be paid. —`Sir—I gave my brother Dick leave to go upon my meadow and shoot muskrats—He went. Do ye think the damned rascal didn't gig 'em?—I want you to bring as many actions against him, as it will bear.' —yours &amp;c. `Never study the law, John, it will be sure to make you a scoundrel—you have some talents that way, now,' (meaning the law, I suppose.) `Pray,' said my mother, I remember,—`pray, do you not, you lawyers, class ideots, lunaticks, children and women altogether?—' `Yes sister—when married—and why not?—said my uncle. I never could bear the law after that; and and now that the doctrine of election, rushed in upon me, like a dark wind, I felt—I cannot well describe how I felt—but as if I could go to the end of all the world —throw off the profession of arms, and set down to some less destructive occupation. My thoughts were all in an uproar—New passions arose—a new ambition —new powers—I thought of being eloquent—the bar —the pulpit—the—pho, pho—why should I relate to you all the disordered wandering of my mind— why?—that you may know the heart of your father— the heart of man, without the peril of encountering it—diseased and festering as it is—with the nakedness of your own.—Boys—I have wrestled with angels—till the sun went down—with devils, till the day broke—and I would have you learn all the wisdom, without any of the sorrow, that I learnt.—Follow me then—I will lead you, for I can do it, as distinctly as if it were but yesterday, through all the vicissitude of my thought, as I walked my horse, leisurely, along the untrodden road.— `To the church—no!—There is no field for ambition—the climate is too changeable—the fashion of our worship too formal and staid—no, I will never go into a place, under pretence of ministering with angels— unless I have angels to minister unto—never, till I have been chastened, even unto death. Clara said right. I have not known myself. These thoughts are new to me—the war once over, I must be something, less helpless and contemptible than a shattered veteran. —The church!—where, as my uncle, the lawyer, used to say—the people go, for every thing but what they pretend to go for—where, if a man want to know who has any new clothes, he has only to go on a cold sunday—every new coat, bonnet and shawl will be there:— After this, I know not well, where I rambled for awhile; but at last, I came to the family again—with a sort of start— That rascally French and Italian—I could hear any thing better. Why not talk English?—The French! —O, I could not love a woman, who had one atom of the French nature in her heart—there was madame G—She was telling me a story one day, and, having omitted some word, upon which the whole joke depended—and a villanous joke it was—she referred me to her husband, who sat at my elbow, for it—with leave to tell me, when she had left he room. He began, and when he came to the part—he forgot it—and bowing to me, ran into the next room, the door of which stood open, where I heard him ask his wife what it was. She told him—and he returned, laughing all the way, and told it to me!—It was a shameful, black guard story, founded on a mistake.—That was French sentiment!—I watched it ever afterward.—I would as soon love a woman, that should send me an indecent picture, while I could hear her voice giving the direction to a servant—under pretence that she could not put it into my hands, herself—as her who could do, this.—Yet—Mrs. Arnauld often speaks of their beautiful propriety—saying that a French girl never ventures to say of a man, that he is well made, a fine person, or any such thing—nor, as we do in Philadelphia, go to see naked pictures, and naked statuary, by ourselves. No—in France, ladies would be ashamed to go to such places, except in the company of men— not merely for protection, but lest it should be imagined that they went in secret, to indulge a vicious appetite.—Nay more—she even justifies the toilette regulations of French women—the etiquette of the boudoir—O shame!—I remember when Miss — was languishing upon a sofa, near me once—a fat, unwieldly, turbulent maiden of fifty, that, Mrs. Arnauld—the mother of—pshaw—I will forget her!—She opened her deep exquisite eyes upon me, with that irresistible wickedness of meaning, so common to her—and reminded me of a French author that we had been reading together (I read the language, but could not speak it)—where he speaks of a pretty woman languishing in bed—and putting out a white hand to you, familiarly, when you enter the room—now and then too, as if by accident, half revealing the prettiest foot in the world—`all very well,' said she, `very well indeed, in the lovely and youthful—but an old woman!—law!' —`You may kick and sprawl,' said I to myself—`all over the room, if you will—but it wont do'—Yes! —the mother of—of—out with it, heart—Clara!—she has put that into my thought. So much for France, and French women, and French sentiment!— By Heaven, but I did love her—O, (Clara I meant) —O—I knew her approach, I could feel it—with my eyes shut, and ears sealed—the sweet influences!—the atmosphere—her fine heart—from my very boyhood —and yet—yet!—I am already an outcast. Well— I thank her, that I am not humbled.— Ellen—Nelly—Nell—what beautiful hair—what a faint, bashful, luminous eye—and that dimple—O, the little creature stood, like something transparent, before me—I thought that I could see her young heart beating, and bobbing about, as if it were encased in chrystal.—Why, did she speak to me?---why?---why do women ever interfere?---why---as they always do in love affairs?---why! the moment that they suspect a partiality in either party do they report an engagement?—O, it is easily told---the startled fawn is not more timid and distant---nor more easily turned aside from the gushing water---than a young heart in its first love.—Every match that a woman breaks off, no matter how, by her meddling impertinence---folly--- lying or coquetry, augments her own chance---because it keeps undiminished the number of unmarried men. Nell Sampson—beware!—there is more evil within this heart than thou art thinking of—more than I, myself, ever dreamt of.—If it be not explained, that, which gave a troubled lustre to the impatient eye of Clara--- ere we meet again, wo to thee!—Winter may pass away—Summer may come—but the scent will lie forever---and you may as well hope to turn the staunch blood hound from her chace---while the spattered silver is upon the green hills---as my heart aside from its purpose. I knew it not, till this moment---I knew not that I had aught of this spirit within me. But now---now I feel, as if I were newly born, indeed, for all that Clara has foretold---born for mischief—as if I could stand up, before the assembled world---herself---my face undisturbed---my forehead unmoved till the vessels of my brain were all ruptured---ruptured by my thought---charged with extravasated blood---the furnace of my heart burning to the last sob.'—I started ---my own breathing was terrible, as these forbidden speeches came out, from the darkness where they had slept so long---breathing!---no, it was snorting---it was like the fierce gasping of a tired panther— Ellen---how beautifully she danced too!---the motion of her limbs made musick. But Clara---she never dances. She is too stately for the dance---too awfully chaste, for the profligate revelry of the dance---and yet I loved her---loved her! Aye, till the very pulse of my life stood still, at her bidding.—This, they call un bending, when a tall, princely creature is fool enough to jump about a large room—to the sound of musick ---fools!---it is bending, rather---bending to the earth. I cannot bear to see a lofty mind employed, so like the babies of this world---I— Clara!---I would never have parted with thee, had I known the full extent of what I have already suffered ---and now---now, dear Clara—it is far less in sorrow, than in anger---that I---I---by the bright sun of heaven! I do fear that we have trampled down, all the beautiful vegetation of the heart---shut our eyes to the loveliest apparition of all our experience---sealed up our senses to the odour that issues from all that is touched by the hot, beating hand of genuine passion---forever and ever! O, Clara—Thy heart, dear!---O give me the unvisited, untouched one---thou wilt never be happy---and I---O, why have I left thee?---Then, why not return?---(I half wheeled my horse)—no---no---sooner would I die ten thousand times over!—' There, my children---there! You have now a fair chart of the rambling incoherent journeying of my thought for some hours---when, happening to put my hand into the breast pocket of my military surtout, I was startled at the rustling of papers. I pulled them out---and, instantly---as if my brother had stood before me, and called me with a pistol shot, from a troubled dream, I started broad awake. They were his letters, to my mother and Lucia. How strangely I had forgotten them.—But what was to be done? my men were no where within sight or halloo---(I confess moreover, that I was not very solicitous that they should be ---for, to say nothing of my soliloquy, which I now felt, as I came to my senses, had occasionally been, far from inaudible—I was not very sorry for an opportunity to return---proudly—for a moment.) They will believe, said I, when they see me riding up, that I have come to sue for mercy. I will not undeceive them---I will enter the house, present them with my own hands, and return, do what they may, to my saddle. I did so---I rode back---no living creature saw me, or announced my approach, until I stood before them--- just about the hour of dinner. Clara fell back upon the sofa. I bowed—and gave the letters to Lucia— who was preparing some herb tea, I thought, in a little silver can. Her hand shook, when she saw the hand writing. `Here is another,' said I, `which you will be so kind as to deliver, after I have gone—' (giving her that to my mother.) She tore open her's, read it—as if it were her death warrant, covered her face, and left the room, forbidding me with her hand to follow. Again I was upon my way—benighted, and, but why need I relate the paltry adventures of the day? The next evening, I was in the arms of my brother, determined never to leave him again. `How fares it brother?' said he—`you are not the man that you were. What has happened?' `Fellowship!'---I exclaimed, giving one hand to him, and another to Arthur, who sat by---`Fellowship!--- `By heaven,' he cried, rising in his bed, and rivetting his steady eyes upon me--`O, by heaven, it has fallen at last! ---all women are alike!---are they not?' `They are,' said I—; and then we embraced. `Well, well---so much the better,' said Archibald. `for Washington. No man can serve two masters. Woman and war, woman and manhood, woman and God are fire and water; they cannot live together for a moment.' `Cousin,' said Arthur---I started to hear the sound of his voice---I could not reconcile myself to it---it was the voice of a stranger---`the reapers are ready---the harvest nodding; we must go down to it, speedily.' `How,' said I--`shall we do any thing; can we, before the spring opens?' `I hope so,' said Archibald---`or we shall starve and rot where we are. `See there!' he cried---pointing to a foot soldier that was hobbling by at the moment--- `that poor fellow has gone, literally barefooted, day after day—among the ice and snow; one third of our men are in the same situation---not one in five has a blanket---and we have been two whole days without provision---the wretched parsimony of these farmers about here, and the villainous new management of the Philadelphians, have brought our little army to death's door.' `Philadelphia!' said I, recollecting my engagement, and inconceivably agitated, with the crowding thoughts that rushed in upon my brain—dilating all the veins, till they ached. `Arthur—what say you for a ride there? Brother, can you spare him?' `I!—Certainly I can. I shall be out in a week; and—but you must seek higher authority than mine, for leave of any absence now.' `Not for myself'—I answered—`I have a furlough.' `True—and I will answer for Arthur—what say you Arthur?' Arthur agreed to it, immediately, as if, like myself, he was ready for any change of scene,—any, in the world, rather than such cold, wintry inaction. And I proceeded to relate the meeting with my mother. Archibald shut his eyes, and pressed his hands, locked and trembling, upon his breast; but, uttered no sound, more, either of surprise or sorrow. The blow was too deep for that—the bleeding was inwardly. I then led him to my interview with Clara—he smiled—shook—started up—but when I came to the trial— and forbore, as I was obliged to, all explanation of the cause which led to the misunderstanding, he caught my hands, wildly. `Brother John—brother!—you are a madman---you have thrown away, like a child, a jewel beyond all price—the heart of a proud woman—O, how I pity you. You are a madman; brother, think of it, down upon your knees and think of it—if it be not too late, too late, beyond all that I can imagine. I know not what you have done, or said, or thought—I care not. She has loved you, and she! Clara Arnauld is not a woman to forget her love. She has loved you, and she will love you, forever and ever. To horse then, to horse! before you sleep, ride for your life---if it be not VOL. I. 19 indeed, too late---too late---and throw yourself into her arms. O, brother, brother! that men should be so wasteful of that happiness, that!---the rapture and passion of a devout woman---as to kill it, so unworthily —! — O, if such a creature—such a creature! any that wore the shape of a woman, were but to move her sweet lips at me, as I have seen the proud Clara, moving them at thee---O, I would lie down upon my face, and set her foot upon my neck---rend my own heart from its socket---and give it to the wolf or the vulture before her eyes.' I was deeply affected with his manner---I cannot deny it. But I was ashamed to follow his advice--- ashamed to tell the truth—for that would be, or might be to breathe upon the spotless bright mirrour, where his soul had grown blind in gazing—and ashamed too, to confess, before his lordly forehead, that I had been capable, first of trifling, innocently, with such a heart, as Clara's; and next, of meditating its reduction, like a famished garrison, by cutting off its nourishment, light and air—as if a heart so wasted—so thinned away, were to be coveted. But I dared not trust myself to any longer contemplation of the subject—chiefly, I believe, because there was something pleasant in this new companionship with Arthur and Archibald—as if my desolation could compare with their's!—O, shame!— the paltry caprice of a heart, drunk with enjoyment, full to repletion, and bursting with triumph and deep rapture —to be compared with the darkness and fire, of a spurned and trodden one—over the embers of which, the wind of passion blew, again—and again, till they blazed with a brightness too terrible for the eye of meditation: —or that appalling, substantial shadow, which lay, like a malediction upon the spirit of Arthur, pressing his broad forehead to the dust—pinioning his faculties, and darkening his thought forever—O, no!—but I heard one rail so eloquently at woman—and the other look so majestically down, upon all the plebian sorrowing of men, in consequence, it seemed, of his trial— that I almost prayed for a reason as terrible!—that I might join in denouncing them too! I then spoke of Clinton—(my brother held his breath) ---told all that I had seen—(his eyes flashed fire— his lips quivered, his teeth rattled—and when I had done, he wiped off the sweat from his face—as if the rain had fallen there—shook his head, and replied,---faintly, but audibly---nevertheless---) `Enough, I can see her, hear her very words—see every movement of her eyes, hands. She is right. You are right. He cannot prevail; there is no hope for him. My letter has done its office.' `Your letter,' said I—unwilling to deceive him. `You are mistaken. When all this happened, I had not delivered the letter.' `What,—do I understand you rightly?—Then— (thoughtfully, while his white brow clouded, as if overrun by a dark blood, all at once)—then, there is a mystery at the bottom of this, which I will drag forth. When will Clinton be out?' I told him all that I knew—and we spent the greater part of the night talking about the family, and their several characters. `Brother,' said I, seeing that Arthur was asleep— `Brother, I believe that Lucia loves you.' `You do,' said he, calmly. `You are right. I have no doubt of it,—more than she ever dreamt of. The time will come when she shall love me more—ten thousand times more than ever. I know her nature now, every thought of her heart.' `Then—let me return your advice—why waste the priceless jewel—?' — `John—! John Oadley,' he replied, rising like a spectre, and stretching out his wasted arms to me— while the fitful lamp-light flashed strangely over his features, in shadow and brightness—`You do not well know me yet. But the time is coming, when you will. You know how I have loved Lucia—that I have loved her, as never man loved woman—would have died at her bidding, and yet—yet! by all the Angels of heaven! I would see her dead and buried—before I would take her to my heart, after Clinton had put his lips upon her face.' The blood spouted from his nostrils as he spoke, and sprinkled the coarse linen of the bed. His look was frightful, his voice solemn, beyond expression, convulsed, and broken; and when he had done, he shed tears. The next day, I took particular pains to look into the state of the troop, enquire the true situation of Archibald, who, I found, was in no danger—obtain permission to go to Philadelphia, with Arthur for a companion; and the third day after my return, just when they began to light the market, we entered the city, at a handsome trot, our sabres ringing, and the iron hoofs of our well shod chargers, rattling, like a whole troop of cavalry along the pavement. `That is the number,' said I, at last—stopping under a lamp, and reading the card—`Take the reins a moment Arthur, while I knock.' There was neither knocker nor bell, though the house was large, and rather imposing—and I struck the door with my loaded whip, till the whole neighbourhood rang again. Several windows were thrown open; but when they saw that we were Continentals—mounted—they were instantly shut again—for they dreaded our visitation, as little better than a robbery, or at least a requisition for every blanket and shoe in the family. A stout, handsome black fellow soon appeared, and, as if he had been prepared to expect us, threw open the door, and descended to take our horses. `Is Mrs. Eustace within?' said I— `Yes—massa, massa he find her in the parlour—' (pointing up a broad stair case, beyond which, we saw a large door standing open)—a room brightly illuminated, as if, with a large fire—and several persons, women, I thought, moving hurriedly about it—like shadows upon a bright wall. We entered, and Arthur, at the sound of two or three voices apparently ascending the stairs over my head, caught suddenly at my arm, as if he were falling. I turned, a little surprised, and beheld a change in his countenance surpassing all that I had ever seen—it was stone—absolute stone. His lips were parted, and while he held my arm till the very bone ached, he stood, like one struck dead, while listening to musick, coming out of the grass—in the low wind. We entered the room; and, before I had time to make my salutation, a pair of soft, delicately soft hands were put into mine—and a voice, that I could not be mistaken in, said to me—(the lights were all gone—and the red blaze of the fire had diminished, so that I could not well see her countenance—and the whole room smelt of burnt camphor, as if that had been thrown upon the fire to dazzle and blind us, as we came up the stairs.) `And is that Mr. Rodman?'—`Yes,' I replied, `but when? in the name of heaven, and how came you here?' `Hush—You have a deep part to play—a tragedy, it may be. You have been expected for two days. I had almost given up the hope of seeing you. I came away after dinner the same day that you did—the house had got too hot to hold me—Clara!—ha!— then there is something in it! Clara Arnauld is—--- Have you heard nothing?—Not a word, since?' `No,' I replied—`how should I?'---- `Then Mr. Oadley, I pity you—you have broken a proud woman's heart.' My own was in my throat, as she spoke, and I was fain to sit down. `Ha—Arthur, what ails you, what are you looking at?' He never moved—but, in a far corner of the room, in a sort of recess, like a library, or venition window with dark curtains, sat a female figure—looking up at the moon, that just then, stood still in the blue heaven, as if held there by the incantation of beauty. The figure moved, sighed; and Arthur, rising slowly, and involuntarily, upon his feet, gradually stretching out his arms, as if—gracious God! The low mournful VOL. I. 19* warbling of a sweet voice came to my ears, like something that I had heard, I know not when—I know not where, before—and Arthur fell flat upon his face. I saw him fall, but I was unable to stir hand or foot—I stood hushed as death—tranced—with a deep, deep terrour and torment at my heart—as if I had broken in upon some haunted place—somebody caught my arm—`Awake!' said a voice—`awake!—speak to it! it is Mary!' I staggered to the window—I fell upon my knees, not daring to breathe, or lift up my eyes—the shadow arose, turned, with a mournful slow motion, so that the moon shone full upon her face. It was Mary! it was! I had only life enough left, to put my hands, like a dreamer fearing to awake, upon her flesh—and see her, the blessed martyr, stooping over me, with her troubled melancholy lips—it was not to be mistaken—O, no!—no, no! the unearthly paleness of her forehead, the preternatural darkness of her eyes, their slow, incessant motion. `Mary!' I cried—`O, Mary, speak to me,' I said, attempting to rise, but her whole weight was upon me. At the sound of my voice, she started—her eyes flashed —her lips moved—she put her hands upon my forehead —pushed aside my thick hair—stooped down, pressed her wet lips to my eye lids and whispered—`O, Arthur, Arthur—how could you leave me?' Her tears ran down her cheeks like rain—and when I looked up, I saw Ellen struggling with all her might, her hair dishevelled, her pale eyes streaming with tears and light—against Arthur, who stood stooping toward her—as if he had been struck blind. Mary had not seen him; I arose, her soft hand beating in mine, her young heart fluttering against mine—her pale neck, against which I had wept— glittering with the tears that I had shed, and put her into the arms of Arthur. The moment that his face touched her's—the very moment, she uttered a loud cry, leaped into his bosom, shivering like a drowned creature, and skrieking and wailing, so piteously, that I—I—could neither hear nor see, till I felt some one dragging at my arm—it was Ellenour. `Come, come,' said she—`come! every thing depends upon this shock; let us leave them together—O, merciful heaven! let us be gone.' I suffered myself to be led away, and we stood at the window of the next room, in the darkness. I know not how it was, except that sorrow, and sympathy are apt to be companionable, and they that have wept together, are many years in advance of them that have only laughed together. I could hear them sobbing yet—and then a sweet gentle murmuring, that I knew to be her's —and then a passionate shriek, and the name of Arthur pronounced, again and again, as in delirium. I would have returned, but Ellen—Miss Sampson, I should say, forbad me. `O, no!' said she, laughing and crying at the same moment---`do not go, do not go, I entreat you---the prettiest catastrophe in the world,' releasing herself from my arms, and skipping to one side of the room, where she could see them. `O, O! come here, come here! this minute —there is love for you—that's your true love—a dead woman, burnt to ashes, coming to her senses, in the arms of her lover. O, O, O, (rubbing her hands, while the dark shadow of Arthur was on her, as he stood, with one knee resting upon a deep sofa in the corner, leaning over, with an air of the deepest and most affectionate tenderness, the beautiful frail creature that lay upon it, half supported by one of his arms; her magnificent tresses floating brightly over the back of the sofa, in the strong current of air that swept up the chimney; and her wild eyes glittering in their humidity, like a young leopard's, in the red fire light; her face upturned to his, and mouth parted like statuary, at the very moment when it is about to be turned into flesh, and the heart is ready to gush out with love and musick at the lips.) `O, look, look!' repeated the eager, delighted girl at my side, catching my hand passionately, and flinging it away again, alternately, with a pettish carelessness, as she was carried away by her enthusiastick heart, at some sudden emotion of Mary, or sufficiently mistress of herself, to discover that she was almost caressing me—a man, a stranger, in the unbridled extravagance of her sympathy. `But how in the name of heaven,' said I, `how is this? That is Mary Austin, I'll swear to it!' `Don't ask me, dont ask me,' she answered—`see, see! she knows him, the dear creature! hear, hear, hear her! dear, dear Arthur! O let us go, let them be alone, and happy for a while;' saying this, she shut the door softly, and coming up to me, past her white hand over her eyes, and then putting it into my hand. `It was dripping wet,' said — while I smiled at her simplicity, lively, and deep feeling, so innocent, yet so disordered. Remember that there was no fire in this room, no light, none but that which the moon threw in, doubtfully, through a long row of curtained windows— `come! now I'll tell you all about it. You thought me crazy; I am not —that poor creature—bless me, why don't you keep the step, (we were walking, to and fro, in the room.) `Let us sit down,' said I, leading her, a step or two, toward the window seat. `No, no, aunt is below—and brother—they must hear us walking, or we shall be interrupted. What the deuce are you laughing at! till that poor creature: O, if you had seen her, when we first found her—she would not open her mouth; she did nothing but cry all day long, and stare at us—just so! why, what's the matter? were you never stared at before?' `Found her!' said I, `what do you mean?' `Lord! that's just like you—you wont let a body say a word; I wish you'd hold your tongue a moment. Brother, you know brother? yes you do, you need not shake your head, I saw you watching him, poor fellow; and let me tell you, Mr. Oadley, as handsome as you be, and as big as you be, and as proud as you be, brother Nick has got as big a heart, and as brave a heart, and as good a heart, as your own. He was the one that saved her—he shot the wicked man, that had her on his horse behind him, and was carrying her off; but then the horse ran away, and when he fell off, she was lashed to him, by a great ugly leather belt—how you breathe, what's the matter?' We were now standing still; and, I confess, that, in the deep intoxication of my heart, I had forgotten Clara, Arthur, Mary, and all the world, for a moment, in looking down upon this innocent little creature, whose delicate lips, were muttering music below me, just even with my breast; every word fell into my heart; I could feel it—I led her slowly, step by step, to the window, and gradually, without knowing my own design, or having any design in reality, had drawn her, as I would have drawn a small child, to sit upon my knee; she was surely unconscious of it, for she never changed her tone, or faltered, or shifted her soft eyes, but continued thus. `We couldn't find out her name; and all the enquiry that we could make, was of no use, for my father said, that she looked like a French girl, and was probably the wife of the trooper, that brother shot; and then there were several farm houses burned that same night; and the horse ran a mile before the rider fell; and when brother, who can run very fast, faster than a horse, through the woods, came up to the poor girl, she was dead—dead as, as—what's the deadest thing in the world? and then he took her up in his arms, and carried her to maj. Winchester's; and when father came, he sent off an advertisement to the paper in the city, describing her, but nobody came to ask how she did; poor creature! and so we slept together, and she never spoke; yet she wasn't mad, not very mad, for she sung sweetly, and was afraid as death of men—and one day, when she was in the street, for she was very quiet, quiet as a lamb; but I was away then, I was at Mr. Arnauld's, and aunt wrote me all about it—she was out there at the next corner, and the prisoners were brought in— them that Washington took up at Trenton, and by and by, when the horses were galloping through the street, she shrieked out, all at once, and fell dead again; and a man that was there on horseback, his horse ran away with him; and all the neighborhood began to talk about it, and make inquiries about him, but he was gone—so my aunt told me, and she said, that the poor thing's name was Mary, and that she was constantly talking about Arthur, Arthur, and Rodman, and Frederick, and Crawford—so my aunt wrote me all about it. It was just a day or two before you came—O, I forgot to tell you, that we found out her name was Mary, for she started and trembled at that name—well, just before I saw you—' `Where,' said I, `do, dear Ellenor, do tell me, so that I can understand you—your eagerness carries you away, I—' `O Lord! was there ever such a wretch—you won't let me say a word—you take my breath away—ha! she is singing—bless her dear heart—there! there! did you ever hear such singing as that?' Somebody opened the door a little, just then, and retreated, leaving it ajar, so that the red light from the next room, flashed along the floor, like a stream of crimson lustre, coming to a point, just at our feet. `Beautiful! is it not?' she cried, putting her little foot on it---do you sing? Come let me hear you. `O, happen what may, love!' Do you know that? Stay, I'll sing that to you, bye and bye---O---I was telling you about poor Mary---So, I was down to Mr. Arnauld's, and just when you were setting off, with that troop of horse, I heard somebody,---one of the girls, pointing to you, as I thought, say—somebody asked who you were, she said that you were Arthur Rodman---and then, when you had gone---but now I remember that Arthur was near you, but I don't mind him much, nor that white faced little fellow there, that they called Archy---Archibald, or some such name—I could see nobody but you, and when I heard from aunt, two or three days after, and that the strange sick girl was talking about Arthur Rodman, I began to enquire all about him, thinking all the while it was you---at last, I could not ask any more—I felt melancholy, and I never mentioned your name, but romped and laughed all the day long, while Clara and Lucia, were moping in a corner. But, at last, when I saw you, and saw you meet Clara, in the bed room, I was provoked at you, and her; and so I determined to know who this girl was, that had gone crazy for you; but it never entered my head, that you were Mr. Oadley, or that the poor mad creature, was Mary Austin, till that very evening, when I found out, that uncle Arnauld was Frederick Crawford. O, the villain! then it came to me all at once—and then, I had made up my mind before, to bring about a meeting between Mr. Rodman and Mary; but mind I don't know who she was, and never knew, till I came to put the whole story together here, the night when brother found her, and the time that your house was burnt, when it came to me all at once, like a blaze of light, and then—Lord, how like a fool you look!' Indeed, I did look like a fool—the whole family were standing at another door, and looking at us! How long they had been there, I know not; it was in the dark side of the room, and it was only at that moment, that my eyes had fallen upon what appeared to move, a mass of shadowy creatures and human faces. They all came forward now, and threw open the broad door, which shewed the whole room to us, where Arthur and Mary sat. I trembled from head to foot; but she—was she a fool? or a maniac? she sat as still and careless upon my knee, turning up her lovely hair, band after band, like a mass of drawn gossamer, over her white forehead. `Well Nick! what are you grinning at?' said she. Nick shrugged his shoulders, lolled out his great tongue, and jogged his father, who only asked her, what the devil she was in my lap for. `His lap! gracious! so I am'—the colour rushed to her temples, her hands fell, her hair veiling her whole face; and when she parted it again, her lashes, and lips, and cheek were all wet with tears and shame. Sweet innocent! as I am a living man, I do believe that she knew it not, till she was told, that she was sitting in my lap. Her enthusiasm, so passionate, fervid; her rapid articulation, her incessant volatility, the electrick operation of her mind, her whole frame, quivering at every shock of her heart, as if her veins ran quicksilver —all this had made her utterly forgetful of propriety; and I, I was the villain, in the deepest tumult of my heart; yea, when it was tormented with a feeling, as if it were naked, and soft female lips and eye-lids, were incessantly touching it all about, I had still sufficient self-command to count the throbbings of her delicate pulse, and drink, to delirium, the passion that her blue eyes shed into my bosom—was it love? no; but I felt that she loved me, loved me, unwittingly, to death; and that set my heart heaving, as if a sudden tide of high wine were beating within it. I arose and apologized; but whether it was that this family were all mad, or all unlike the rest of human creatures, no further notice was taken of it, than a heavy curse or two from the old gentleman on my modesty, and a good natured warning from the aunt, for young ladies, in dark moonlighted apartments, to keep walking if they can, as long as they can. Ellen kicked up her heels, and was skipping off to the room in front, when she suddenly stopped, shook her finger at us, and leaned forward, like a spirit worshipping at the altar of true love, for the first time. They appeared not to heed our approach; they sat upon the same sofa, holding on each other's hands—and just then—Mary, who had been looking in the face of Arthur, as if she feared that it would lade away, if she took off her eyes for a moment; the tears running continually down her pale cheeks, drop after drop; gushed out, all at once, into a passionate burst of sorrow, and articulated his name. Arthur, poor fellow! as if he too thought it all an apparition, caught up her hands to his mouth, and covered them with kisses, while his eyes ran over, open as they were, and rivetted upon hers. The trial was becoming too terrible for us—and we rushed in to separate them—but they clung to each other, like two phantoms. Mary shrieked, and Arthur grasping her with one arm, drew forth his bright sabre, and flourished it over his head,—with a perpetual motion—as if he feared to be torn from her again. At length, however, he became more rational, sheathed his sword, laughed, wept, danced—and embraced us all, one after the other, in spite of the cries that Nick uttered, as if all his joints were crushed, or the awkwardness of the aunt, whom he held up, two feet from the floor, while she covered her face with her hands, and squalled with downright vexation. `Fire and fury! cried old Mr. Sampson—`give me a sword! give me a sword, Nick! are you all mad? Bedlam---Bedlam broke loose!' What might have happened, I know not, had the old man succeeded in drawing Arthur's sword from the sheath, while he was dancing about, with Ellen in his arms, like a madman, had not young Nick caught his hand, when it was about half out of the sheath, and made him, by main force, relinquish his design, by holding his arms behind him, while he stamped and swore. `Fire and fury, sir, put her down! what the devil, Nell, are you mad? this comes of your plot and catastrophies and—put her down? damn you, put her down! let go my hands Nick.' `Let go my hair!' father—yelled the boy—`let go my hair!' while the father suddenly released himself, (just as Ellen fell out of Arthur's arms, exhausted, upon the sofa,) and stood in the middle of the room, with both hands full of hair. As soon as Ellen could get her breath, she burst into a loud laugh, in which Nick soon joined, with a noise like the yelping of twenty water spaniels; then the father, then the aunt, and finally, all but Arthur, who began to recover, and poor Mary, who sat, staring at us, through her white fingers, as if every moment she expected to see us all vanish, in a flash of sulphur. VOL. I. 20 But enough of this—Mary was not mad, not actually deranged, the blood of her heart had only stagnated for awhile; and, before we parted, she was able to relate, by starts,—with some interruptions of passionate sorrow, and a few slight aberrations of reason, what she recollected of that terrible night. She saw Arthur's face in the blaze; and, the next moment, saw him fall, as she believed, and fled; was pursued; and all that she recollected afterward was, that there was a great outcry, and an explosion behind her, the sky all red with the flame of the dwelling, and a man on horseback, after her—he overtook her, but, hearing a trumpet, appeared to hesitate for a moment, and then, as if he had no design to join his comrades, set off, with her at a full gallop in a contrary direction, through the wood; several shots were fired, and once, she thought, by men in a military dress, at a considerable distance—and then she heard them cry, a deserter, a deserter! a Hessian! and a few moments after, they fell together, and he— he, to whom she was lashed, was a dead man;—in the distraction of her mind, she strove to unloose the belt that bound her; but she could not—and, then the thought of dying in the lonely wilderness, bound to a dead body, with no power, none, for she was helpless as if bound up in a winding sheet, to scare away the wild beast, or wipe off the blood that she felt soaking to her very heart, and trickling over her forehead and eyelids, down her cheek. And that was all. What happened afterward she knew not, till somebody called her Mary---Mary! The darkness drifted away then—but there were fire and smoke rolling and rushing all about her---and then, then—a horseman went by her--- where she knew not where! It was in a strange place, and many beautiful women were about her---large horses, and a great crowd of armed and unarmed men with downcast faces---and then, she grew gradually, more sensible of the past; but, afraid to speak of Arthur whom she had seen fall, she determined,---for the people about her were very gentle—to live and die among them, without telling her story. But, some how or other —her brain grew strangely dark, and she did tell it and—`O! Arthur!' she cried, throwing herself into his arms—`I remember it all now—all! will you forgive me—can you?' `As I hope for mercy!' Mary, he cried, raising his large, noble eyes to heaven—and then bowing his head upon her hands, and kissing her white neck. `As I hope for mercy, Mary! this miraculous restoration of what I most loved, upon all the earth—so surpasses all that my disordered dreaming has ever pourtrayed to me—that, if I were the wickedest of mortal men, the most implacable—I could not but become religious, and humble, and forgiving—O, Mary! Mary!—I cannot bear to let go your hand—even yet, I cannot fully persuade myself that you are a living woman— it is too like the dreams that I have had, night after night, till my blood has been dried away, and my heart exhausted by them!' `There—there! that will do, dear Mr. Rodman, dear Mary—now what do you think of me, Mr. John? am I a fool? am I crazy. Show me a woman that has done as much good as the giddy Nell has—there, do go now, will you?'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. `I've felt my heart grow strangely cold, `And sink, as though its pulses slept, When, underneath thy shadowy fold, `I've felt thine unrelenting hold, `As midnight, and have waked and wept: `I've liv'd to see thy damp dispell'd; `Thy wet, cold shadow pass away; `And that despotick phantom quelled, `That, o'er my blood dominion held, `Like night snow o'er the flower of day.' `Well, Arthur,' said I, when we had, at last, found a tavern, to put our heads into, `I am glad to hear the sound of your voice once again; what do you think of all this matter?' `Think!' said he, looking alarmed—`think! why, it is all real, is it not?' `Certainly,' I replied, troubled a little at the wildness of his eyes, and the terrour that his face expressed. `Let us go back this moment!' he cried `there is no knowing what may happen—come cousin.' `Why,' said I, `you are not afraid that the house will vanish before morning, are you? How shall we find the street?' `Ah, cousin, if you felt as I do, so full—full—O, heavenly father! you could not smile at any thing; come, I cannot sleep; will you go with me?' `No, I am tired to death; I haven't slept quietly for a week.' `Then I will go alone,' said he, firmly, `I will not lose her again; I will sleep upon the steps.' `And be taken up by the patrole!' said I. `Shall I! (striking his sabre hilt,) they'll have their hands full.' `Arthur Rodman,' said I, seriously, `this is childish; I looked for better things in you, after such a tremendous trial. Have you no command of yourself? where is your manhood?' His cimetar rattled upon the floor; he turned, and faced me, for a moment, like an enemy; but that bearing soon passed away, and he gave me both his hands, saying, in the well remembered voice of a generous heart, solemnized by trial and suffering—the voice that he uttered before the loss of his loved one—before his noble face had turned to stone—petrified in the continued dropping of his heart from his eyelids. `Jonathan Oadley—cousin—I forgive you; I forgive you, with all my heart and soul. Pity me; who knows what may happen; fire and sword may reach her again; do you wonder that I should haunt the place of her habitation, after all that I have suffered? O cousin! if there were but one possibility, in millions and millions, that the spoiler might approach her again, or the fire break out, while she was sleeping, and I asleep upon my post—what would become of me, John! I have been near, very near, nearer than you would believe, to self-destruction—more than once; but God hath palsied my arm, turned aside the bayonet, and melted the bullets into rain; but let this happen again, and God himself would be weary of interposition. O, you know not what I have suffered; look there! (taking a paper out of his bosom,) see you that dust! that is her heart! in that paper, have I persuaded myself, are the ashes of her blessed heart! I went among the live embers at midnight; I leaped into the flames, sought with my naked arms, among fire and smoke, and crumbling skeletons, where I had seen her and the man that I slew, fall. I found them, buried in ashes; blind and desperate with horrour, I tore them asunder, plucked away the white bones, yet reeking with blood and transparent with heat, dislocated every limb, and saw her pure and blessed heart, naked, within its habitation; I put my hand upon it, and it crumbled to ashes VOL. I. 20* —there are the ashes!—Do not look so terribly upon me, John; I am neither mad, nor wandering, nor have I been; this was done in secrecy, and, to my last breath, it had never been known—never, never! but for this miraculous discovery. O, my cousin! this will explain it all; my silence, fixedness, sleeplessness. Why should I be heard? why should my voice be uttered? Had I not, perpetually burning against my heart, this terrible relick; all that there was on this side of the blue heaven, to comfort me; why should I murmur? why complain? was there not a perpetual warmth and consolation here? why turn aside from death? when death itself, was perpetually at my heart, for here I wore it—here! the place is red you see, even now, with the preternatural vitality that the ashes retained. Why should I sleep? could sleep give me any consolation—any dreaming, so wonderful and comforting, and composing, so like death, as the stupifying pressure and warmth of these ashes? O, no—no cousin; look at me. I appear stout and strong; my tread sounds like the tramp of a war horse; my voice is like the voice of a strong man; my eyes full of brightness—yet, had not the battle speedily borne me down, nor the pestilence, nor the sword, I should have died infallibly, of a broken heart, ere another summer had shone upon me. There! I have done with that now, (scattering the ashes to the wind,) I give it to the winds! Spirit of woman, whoever thou wast, I bless thee! from the deepest place of all my heart, for the consolation that I have felt in the deceit—to the winds with thee! and may God gather thy dust into his bosom, as I have gathered it into mine!' No John, I know that it is childish; I feel that it is; yet, there is a possibility; and that is enough for one, that has been going out in his own darkness so long; there is a possibility, that my watchfulness may be of use—good night! I do not ask you to accompany me; I cannot sleep—you can. Sleep then, and may your dreams be as sweet as mine, though it rain ice upon me—aye, or fire, while I am lying before her door. Smile if you will—laugh at my extravagance; I had rather be laughed at, than weep tears of blood, or carry the ashes of a human heart in my naked bosom, till they have consumed me.' `Well,' said I, `go, if you will; a few weeks will sober you down. I do not blame you—I cannot— I only wish to heaven, that I had some one, to watch over, in the same way, and you should have a fair pull for the mastery, though the north pole thundered upon us in broken ice, and the stars dropped upon our heads.' `Oadley, you are laughing at me—good night.' `Good night—you remember the street?' `Remember it! aye, blindfolded, I could go to it— by the alarum here? that would lead me aright.' He left me, and I sat down to ruminate on the events of the day. Clara was still uppermost in my thought, and a hot, scorching sensation of shame flashed, like the heat of a furnace, over my face, as I thought of her now. Had I done right? Would I have set patiently to see her—her—in the lap of another man! The thought was madness; I struck the table with such force, that my arm pained me to the shoulder, for a whole hour—I started upon my feet. `Yet what have I to hope—proud, invindible woman!' I cried, `what have you left to me! nothing, nothing but abject humiliation. Can I go to you? and kneel, and supplicate to be heard? weep for a new trial? and pray you to forgive me, that—curse on the spirit, that drove us asunder. But ten thousand curses on that, which would put a man at the feet of a woman, whose lord, he would be. No! no! Clara, thou shalt never have to reproach the husband of thy heart—the father of thy children—thy children! dear Clara, I, I—my tears fall like rain, now—never—for having forgotten the manhood of his nature. No, Clara, no! I can die for thee—die many deaths; but as I have never sought thee, for a mistress; but, for a companion in trial, a partner in love, a relation for all the heroick sympathies of our nature, a wife—I cannot, will not, sue to thee.' `What then; is Ellen Sampson the woman to supplant thee, thee? O, believe it not. Thou art a woman, Clara; she, a child; thou, lofty and commanding; she, timid and fearful, yet rash and passionate, imprudent and perverse, so that—may I not teach her, by some cruel lesson—sparing her, in the hour of her extremest self-abandonment—may I not teach her what nothing else can. I may? But have I the power? Does she love me? so ardent, so sudden, so impetuous, so innocent, so changeable, so volatile, yet so sensible. May I not, without destroying this flower, breathe so hotly upon it, that the white leaves will shrivel, for a moment, and protect the dew at the heart. I will; but my own strength, am I sure of that? Clara, be thou with me; I invoke thy chaste spirit! I do not tremble. Thou shalt be by me, and, if I falter, let thy tears drop upon me, though I see thee not! let thy farewell sound in the low wind! though thou art invisible! and I shall know thee, and forbear. I shall, I know it, I feel it.' I slept after this, and was wakened by the tread of somebody entering my room, softly. I arose, and put my hand upon my pistols, which were always at my head, and often in my hand, while I dreamt, I dare say, of late, since I had been taught to lie upon my arms in camp. It was Arthur. `It is, as you said—the Philistines have been upon me,' said he. `What o'clock is it?' said I, startled at the cold sternness of his voice. `Near day break,' he replied, `the stars begin to look dim, and the east is growing fiery.' `What has happened? sit down, and tell me; you will disturb the whole house;' (he kept walking about.) `You know,' said he, `that I am not quarrelsome, but rather patient.' I could not see his countenance; but there was a movement in the mass of black shadow before me, as he sat upon the bed, that shook the whole room. `Yes,' said I, `you have always been remarkable for your forbearance; what has happened? I have seen you put up with many a thing, that, had you been a little man, or not half so strong as you are, (he had the strength of a lion,) you would have died to avenge. But the powerful are always magnanimous; it is only the weak, that are irritable and waspish; they dare not forgive; for it would be attributed to pusillanimity—but what has happened?' `I'll tell you,' he replied, `I have been closely engaged—hotly—with a troop of scoundrels, watchmen, I dare say—and was finally obliged to cut my way through them.' `Did you leave any in the field?' said I, forgetful of the difference between cutting an enemy down in Philadelphia and Trenton. `No, but I disabled one fellow, who thurst a pole into my face.' `O, if that be all, come to bed.' `To bed! no, I thank you—I am going on another errand.' `Not to the same place, I hope—are you mad?' `No—I shall only go near enough, to see the top of the house, in case of fire, you know.' I laughed outright. `In case of fire!' said I, `come, come, a little sleep will fit you the better for duty, by and by.' `I cannot sleep,' said he, `I must walk about, I am too happy to sleep—so happy, that, as I am a living man, Oadley, I should have made some of the rascals a head shorter, but for Mary.' `How! did she see you?' `Not that I know of,' he replied, `but at the thought of her—her, Oadley—my heart was at peace with the whole world, upon my soul; I could have shaken hands with the devil himself, or a Hessian, had I met him.' `Suppose you send them all, to acknowledge the favour at the feet of Mary,' said I, `you are but little, less mad, than Don Quixotte himself.' Stop, I'll go with you, I dare not trust you out again, alone.— Let us tackle our nags, and take a view of the city, till after breakfast—when we'll call on Mary, and —.' `And blue-eyes—hey, Cousin?' said he, laughing for the first time, as he used to, months before. I could have wept for joy. I told him so, and we were soon upon our proud horses, rattling with their iron hoofs toward the Schuylkill. Our ride was pleasant; but our blood was in such a tumult, that, it was impossible to see or hear any thing—Arthur's face, O, it was religious and composing to look upon it! About noon, for we had been compelled to observe an uncommon etiquette for the age, in consequence of our shabby wardrobe, which required no little coaxing and furbishing to make it tolerable, we made our appearance before the ladies. `Lord! what a coxcomb you are!' cried Ellen, the moment that we entered; and Arthur met Mary, whom he led off—`look at your hair, now!—powdered and frizzled like a wig of soap suds—Here, here! come and sit down by me; there! turn your head, brother, pack off—Nancy, bring me a broom—there! whew! there---whew! whew!' In a twinkling, all the powder that the scoundrel at the barber's shop had covered my brown hair with, was in the wind, a cloud of dust—`there!' she cried, jumping upon the sofa, `there! now look in the glass, Nancy, bring father's shaving glass.' I caught one look, it was quite enough, I coloured to the eyes—the romping girl had put my hair, which, I cannot deny it—was remarkably beautiful, into the strangest disorder in the world, by brushing out the powder with a corn broom. `Lord, you are angry now—ha! ha! ha!—(dancing round me, and shaming me with her fingers) I can see it in your eyes!' I attempted to catch hold of her, for the room was empty—but she drew up, and pronounced with an expression, particularly comick, a famous maxim of the day. `Too much freedery breeds despise.' `Come hither, child,' said I—`come.' `Child,' she repeated, pouting and colouring—`I am no child, I assure you.' `Well, well—come to me, a moment—Ellenour, dear Ellenour—and listen to me, as you would to your own brother.' She stopped—looked more serious than I had ever seen her, glanced at the door, and repeated the word brother, with a marked, but delicate emphasis. `Are we safe from interruption?' said I, `for a few minutes?' `All the morning—all,' she replied. `They have all gone to dine at Mr. Fillows, all but brother Nick, little Nancy there, and I.' Saying this, she tripped up to the door and locked it—and then came back, a little agitated I thought, to the sofa, as if restrained by some new feeling, from her customary display of festivity and girlishness. `Come hither,' said I—taking her hand gently, and drawing her to me, so that my face was just opposite her bosom. I looked up, with a strange hurry in my blood, and put my hand, my left hand, while my arm encircled her waist, upon her shoulder. Her eye lids drooped; and a rush of scarlet passed over her neck, warming my very hand, where it lay, upon her beautifully moulded shoulder. My deliberate intention, when I held this thoughtless, innocent creature so near to my heart, that every throb of her's, I could feel, like a little bird fluttering to get loose, was to give her a gentle admonition, that, she should never forget,—but a new, strange, yet delightfully intense feeling shot through my veins; and, when I looked upon her, so young, so utterly within my power—I could have wept upon her neck—`Ellenour,' said I, after several vain attempts, to articulate— `Ellenour.' She put her soft hand upon my forehead, as if she meant to assuage the throbbing that she saw there; I dared not look up again---but at the touch of her hand, drew down her face to mine, and impressed a kiss upon her sweet mouth. She started, as if a serpent had stung her---turned deadly pale, and burst into tears. `Ellen,' said I---dear, `dear Ellen, forgive me---I ---I---knew not what I did' (a lie by the way)---she was speedily soothed---but I---accursed spirit that it was---I felt still, an invincible desire to try the sincerity of her heart yet further---and, while her pale cheek was yet wet---and pressed against mine---her voice murmuring faintly in my ear---`don't---O, don't'---I pressed her again to my heart, and imprinted, kiss after kiss, upon her forehead, lips and eyes, in a transport of passion--- but then my heart smote me---the spirit of Clara, the awful Clara passed before me---and I turned to the sweet flower upon my bosom, blasted, like some blossom, by a storm of hot ashes, she gave no sign of life---her beautiful hair was all over my shoulders, her pale lips just parted, so that her bright teeth were visible within, her arms falling lifelessly over my shoulder. I was terrified to death---she had been utterly in my power--- utterly—no human help was near, no arm to save, no eye to pity---yet, God be merciful to me for it! I was merciful to her. At last she stirred, opened her soft eyes, attempted to stand up, but when she saw me again---the thought of what had happened, and what might have happened, pure and blessed as she was, rushed darkly over her face again, and she gasped for breath---and fell again upon my bosom---and sobbed for ten minutes, as if her dear heart would break into ten thousand flaws.—I did not attempt to sooth her—I would not, I was willing that she should feel as bitterly as woman can, the peril of such confidence---the humiliation and horrour, of such an escape. And then, while she trembled from head to foot---shuddered---and turned away---O, with such a look of thankfulness and supplication! I—I threw open the door, and proposed a walk; she understood me, and aware of the necessity that there was to appear unmoved, she hurried in preparation, and we went out together. The air blew coldly; yet the shaking of her arm, as it was locked in mine, was not the palsy of cold. It was that of the heart. At last, I had an opportunity prepared of speaking to her---face to face. `Ellen,' said I—`hear me. You do not well know me, yet. I am not a villain. Do not weep, dear, do not. I shall be gone to day; (her hand trembled and beat violently in mine) the chances of battle, you know —a thousand things—(I wanted to mention the name of Clara, but I dared not—I felt as if it were profanation and cruelty—wanton cruelty)—may prevent you from ever hearing what I have now to say to you. Beware of your own heart You are too unsuspicious, too frank. Men are—I will not say what they are—but I believe this, and I would have you remember it—that there is not another man living, who would have spared you, as I have. Nay, hear me out, terrible as it is to you. What could have saved you? what, but my own forbearance? You were powerless, in a trance. No mortal man, Ellen could have torn you from my arms, yet—yet—I would have you remember it—you were permitted to leave them unprofaned. Can I give you any greater proof—is there any under heaven—that I have unconquerable principle at the bottom—and that I love you her hand fell from my arm, and her tears ran down (her cheeks like rain—) too tenderly, too purely, to wrong you. No Ellen—I pity you—I compassionate you. It is a bitter and terrible lesson for you—but it will save you, with your delirious sensibility, from one, more bitter and terrible. Luckily for you, you fell, inexperienced as you are, into the hands of an honest and honourable man. And now, what have you for your consolation? You are humbled to the dust—I know it—I see it. But hear me. I know your sex, ten thousand times better than you do. There never lived that woman, who might not be brought into the same peril. I never met with one—no not one— whom, I could not have destroyed, if I would—with the same opportunity that I have had with you.—I do not mean as to time—but, if I once had a place in her heart —and one hour of hallowed surety from interruption. You tremble. Let this comfort you. You may believe me: for I cannot tell a falsehood; and the more that you know of me, or of woman, the more you will be convinced of the truth of this.' VOL. I. 21 `Your patience for a moment—I see Arthur and Mary yonder; we will join them. But let me assure you, dear Ellenour, of this—I know that it will comfort you—my tenderness for you is quickened, unutterably, by this event; it has made me acquainted with your whole heart, all its confidence, all its indiscretion—and my respect—yes, tremble if you will, you have been upon a precipice, one of shame and death—reproach and dishonour, tremble! let it be a warning to you, my dear girl—but remember this, I cannot deceive you— my respect for you, I know what I say, my respect for you is greater than ever. You have heart, sensibility, courage. You are no longer a giddy child, you are a woman now, in experience. Remember this. I love you more and respect you more than ever.' Poor girl—she tried in vain to dry her eyes---and when we met Mary, neither could look into the others face---they joined hands, and blessed each other, and we continued our walk in silence —: and, finally, returned to the house, in season to partake of a cold dinner, after which we spent the day with Mary and Ellen---so happily, and so innocently, though scarce a word was spoken, that I have often gone back to it in thought, as to one of the happiest, upon the record of my whole life. Our party, toward the hour of separation, was augmented by a dashing girl, and one or two young, riotous, ill-bred men, who, we were told, were Quakers. The girl was not---but she was a celebrated toast---and really confounded us with her volubility and affectation Her dexterity was infinite, her blunders incessant, and not unfrequently, I had occasion to admire the delicacy of reproof,—or the wit of Ellen. `I can't bear her for my life,' said Miss Fitzwilliams (the lady I have just mentioned)—a fat, vulgar creature, with all the fellows at her heels.' `Ha! ha! ha!—haw! haw! haw—' laughed the brace of Quakers, sprawling their legs about, and leaning back in their chairs, with their hands in their breeches. `Plenty o' stuff,' cried one—`haw! haw! haw!—' `Ha! ha!—hee, hee!' cried the other. `O, yes,' cried Miss Fitzwilliams, `rich as Keezus— or the dog of Venus.' `Or the Dolphin of France, or Clam of Tartary,' said Nell, cutting in, with her eyes dancing in their sockets. Mary smiled—and Arthur was fain to stoop down for something near the fire, while Miss Fitzwilliams, asked, with great eagerness, which of 'em all was the richest? `Keezus,' I imagine, said Nell—without stirring a muscle. `Yes—I thought so—I've read again and again, about them other fellers,—but—well, Lord, I wonder how a woman can sleep, when she knows that the men are only running after her, for her money's sake? `And why not?' said Ellenour—with a sudden change of countenance, that startled me—could it be possible—was all her vivacity artificial! I really began to believe so, so gracefully, so beautifully, sat the sweet dignity of seriousness upon her delicate features. `And why not, for a woman's money! as well as for her beauty! or her family! or her voice! or her fashion! or her dancing? Woman cannot expect to be loved for herself alone. And she who would be unhappy at the thought that a man had married her for her money, alone, and not for herself, would be cruelly apt to believe, if she were beautiful, that he had married her, not for herself, but for her beauty.' `La! how you talk—well, did you ever?—' said Miss Fitzwilliams, rising, and wrapping her fine tipped about her beautiful joseph—utterly unable to reply, while I, astonished at the manner of Ellenour, went up to her—and gave her my hand, with a look of veneration and deep sincerity that I know she felt, for she coloured to the temples, and her eyes filled instantly— `heaven bless you!' said I. `You have raised yourself wonderfully—wonderfully in my estimation. Persevere! and never forget—night nor day, what I have told you. If you ever want a friend, a counsellor, a brother, remember me.' `Farewell Mary, farewell!' said Arthur—I had descended the stairs and saw him bow his head upon her neck. `Remain here. You are not yet, entirely recovered. Remain here. Write to me; and I will to you. It is hard to part; but, it must be—farewell.' We walked on, in silence, to our lodgings, entered the room, which was encumbered with baggage, pedlars pack, trunks, and men lying about the floor, in all directions. `To bed,' said I, taking the light. `Just as you say,' he replied—lingering. `I should prefer setting off directly; the moon is very bright, and I am impatient for action.' `To camp!' said I, `Are you mad—when do you expect to find time to sleep there, if you can't here?' `Well, well, John—to bed here, then. But; for myself, I had rather ride, all night long, under that cold moon light.' `With the northern blast, blowing a hurricane of snow into your eyes, I suppose,' said I. `Yes—than to lie down on the softest bed, in the city'—he continued. Be that as it may, we slept quietly, awoke betimes, paid our reckoning, contrary to the custom of the day, and were soon upon our return.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. `Among my hopes, too early blown, `But one is left—its hermit glow `In solitude is lovelier though, `And warmer, like the flowers I've known, `O'er cold, dark earth neglected thrown, `Retired and blooming, though alone, `A violet hope beneath the snow.' For two whole hours, not a word had been spoken. `John!' said Arthur, turning about, and looking me steadily in the face, `are we in our right senses, do you believe?' `We! I cannot be positive for more than one,' said I, laughing—`but' — `I am serious,' he said, interrupting me, `I am deeply troubled here, (laying his hand upon his heart,) and I do fear, that, I am not sufficiently grateful to our Father above, for this to prove a reality.' I was struck by the expression of his face—it was cloudy. `My dear Arthur,' I replied, riding up abreast, and taking his hand, `I do not wonder at your feeling. Few such mercies as these, are ever vouchsafed to man —and at this period of our lives, while the hot blood is racing through our veins, with every thought and impulse, we are apt to be especially neglectful of our duty to God. Let us be wiser. The battle is forever at hand now. Let us not be found asleep upon our post.' `Right, cousin,' said he, recovering, and with a solemn movement of the arm, confirming every word that VOL. I. 21* I uttered, as if it had been a vow, about to be registered above; `I have thought much of it, during the darkness and terrour that have been about me; but never so intensely, so emphatically, as since the hour that Mary, dear Mary, stood up before me, like one touched by the hand of a prophet, and brought anew into life, that I might be a better man. Yes—I have thought much of it, and have came to this resolution—to be prepared for death, at any moment; not, as I have been, by desperate hardihood, indifference, or a desire of quieting the dark tumult in my mind; but as a man, a Christian. Let us be prepared; not by burnishing our arms, or sleeping upon them; but by a prayerful and uninterrupted reference to our Maker, in every moment of our life. O, John! our lives have been a reproach to us. Say what we will, of His mercy; comfort ourselves as we may, with the thought, that we have no heavy sins to our charge, yet, yet, cousin, considering our temptations, we have transgressed heavily. I feel it—I know it.' The tears ran down his manly face, but he did not appear to be sensible of it, for he kept on, in a slow walk, side by side, with me, stopping now and then, and putting his hand upon mine, as if to enforce what he said. `I have rushed into battle, headlong, like a wild beast—careless of my destiny, and drunk with passion. So have you; we have never stopped our horses, in the smoke and flame, for a single instant, to bless God, that we were yet on the saddle—nay, nor when it was over, have we ever fallen upon our faces, among the dead and dying, to thank our Almighty Father, that we were not of the number. O, cousin! these are sins, unpardonable sins, when creatures like us, so untutored in the way of blood, can spur our horses over whole ranks and layers of the dead: behold the lacerated bosom of a human creature gushing out, under the blow of our iron hoofs; stumbling over human faces, gashed lips and ghaslty eyes; we, who have been so peacefully and quietly brought up, without emotion, after a few weeks of desperate familiarity with blood; what will become of us, if the war should last for many years? will our hearts be human then? will there be one atom of our earlier nature left? one atom, that has not been baptized in blood, and hardened in fire? No cousin! this is my resolution—to say little of my duty henceforth, but to do it, night and day—never to talk of religion, but to nurse it, in the holiest place of all my heart—to fight the battles of my country, though there be no end to them, till she be the conqueror—before I dream of any other duty.' `What! Arthur, you would not give up Mary, the new found Mary?' `No—never, but with life. But love shall not sway me, as it does other men; it shall not make me forgetful of my country, or my God. No! He has given her to me again, from the fire and smoke of the midnight ravisher—untainted—unprofaned; and He can preserve her for me, till the night of darkness hath gone over my country.' `You will marry her tho'?'— `Marry her! while the question of slavery is unsettled—while America is loosened to her foundation— marry her! and make a coward of myself—in the battle—a traitor to the great cause—double and treble the stake that I am now playing for—her widowhood and the orphanage of our children—slavery!' `Children!' said I, smiling. `Aye, cousin—children! I do not tremble in pronouncing the word; I do not, and will not, affect an impious insensibility on that subject; if I marry, I look to have children, or I never would marry, never! and would I, think you, hazard the begetting slaves—what! leave the children of Mary Austin and Arthur Rodman, the dark heritage of slavery! no—let us die, if it must be—toiling and wrestling for freedom; but till we are free—let us not put in hazard the freedom of our posterity. No! let the nation be extinguished—the whole nation—rather! But —' Our horses plunged together, as he spoke, and set off at full speed; we rode breast to breast, for half a mile, before we could fairly subdue them. `A good omen,' said I, `we must ride together, Rodman, together! whatever happen.' `Agreed,' he replied, striking my horse upon the swell of his chest—`agreed! the heart of that beast, John, is beating with the contagion—hark! how it rattles in his chest. Think you, that men have less ardour, less emulation—no! blood horses will split their arteries in the race; and shall men, like ourselves, faint and fall away, at a less hazard?' Thus you see, my children, somewhat more of this man's character. I had never known him, nor myself; nor indeed, had we known each other, till the war broke out, and we had ridden man and horse, over man and horse, elbow to elbow, in the red battle. Whether it be, that trial and calamity, war, and the perilous vicissitude thereof, do really create a new character, or only develope the sooner that which is, that which might never have been known, under a more quiet sky, and less troubled temperature; whether it be, that all men have certain hidden capabilities, or hidden faculties and talents, that are only to be revealed, improved in the storm and convulsion, I know not; but this I know, that out of four or five men, whom I had known all my life, before we went into battle together, —there was not one, who did not, ere the war had ended, manifest a grandeur of thought, a sublimity and energy of expression, and a steadiness in action, infinitely transcending all that I could have conceived of him, before the war. Look at the men of our revolution; where do you find such faces now? Why are not their children's written over, and sculptured as deeply? Why! because the impress of relationship—the hand of nature, never yet operated upon the countenance of man, and never will, with aught of that terrible distinctness, with which political convulsion chissels out the head and the face of her chosen ones. Look at the men of our revolution—their very countenances are the history of the time. You may believe me, my dear boys, that this abrupt disclosure of Arthur had an amazing effect upon me. —It set me meditating upon my own imprudence—upon Clara—and ere we arrived at the tent of Archibald, for we took a wide circuit in reaching Morristown— I had made up my mind, to be a better man, and a truer one, to heaven and to her. `Brother,' said Archibald, who was sitting up when we entered, `I have been impatient for your return. We must not leave our lone mother in a strange house.' `Why not,' said I, `Lucia ministers to her like a daughter; and where shall she go?' Arthur could contain his feelings no longer; he threw himself into a chair, and sobbed aloud—continually repeating the name of Mary, Mary.' `Poor fellow,' said Archibald, turning towards him, and leaning upon his shoulder; `what has happened to him?' I was fain to tell the whole; for some minutes, Archibald stood upright, looking at me, with a stern, pallid countenance, as if doubting whether I was not in sport; his eyes then began to move—tears ran round the balls, and he put his hand upon my temples, and shook his head, as if, perhaps, he thought that I was disordered; but be that as it may, he soon knew the whole truth, and of the whole three, he was the happiest! Never did I see his heart so full; his religious, devout rapture, so eminently expressive, as now, in his mute blue eyes; shaking hands, and convulsed lips. `Let us separate,' said he, `I cannot talk now— leave me awhile.' We arose at his bidding, and went out, traversing the camp, and maturing our thought for the future; but almost in silence, for the stillness was only broken, now and then, by some contraction of the hand, and a deep breathing for a moment, as we turned, alternately, in our march, and caught each other's arm—unable to speak, yet too happy, far too happy for silence. And here my children, you will allow me to pause awhile, remarking, that no matter of importance took place for several weeks in our little camp, till Archibald was restored, and Clinton, rejoined us—for the purpose of carrying your thought abroad, to the more distant operations of our country, in the field and council. Congress was now sitting in Baltimore; and one of their first movements was to declare George Washington, supreme and independent, as the commander of our armies, and manager of the war—nay, to declare him little else than a military dictator. They were wrong. They deserved to be tumbled from their seats for it. At first, they were so niggardly and dastardly in their grants—so bountiful in their limitations, and restrictions, and qualifications, and conditions, that he was little else, than a nominal commander, incapable of exercising any discretion, but at the peril of a court martial. And now they put into his hands—the sword—and the purse—and the law— at one, and the same moment. They betrayed their trust. They behaved unwisely—and though it gave to George Washington's virtue, the last trial—the trial of fire—yet the men that put him to the proof, deserved to be trampled to the earth—bound hand and foot, and driven over by the iron chariot of despotism. It was no virtue of theirs—no want of power, or opportunity in Washington—nothing but his own sublime and heroick disdain of crowns and sceptres, and all the paltry baubles, that other men—and the greatest too— have coveted—nothing but that—which prevented him, from being a king in the land—backed by the whole power of Great Britain. He was left to appoint, and displace his officers at pleasure, establish their pay— call for any number of men, that he pleased, from the several States, and compel the publick to receive the continental paper at par—as if any human power could do that! The enemy began to threaten Lee, too, with the punishment of a deserter; and Congress immediately authorised Washington to retaliate, blow for blow, in dignity for indignity, upon Colonel Campbell, and five Hessian field officers. This led to an alarming agitation in the publick mind; and then there had been a serious disagreement brewing at the North, which finally led to a reproof, of General Schuyler, one of the most indefatigable men, that ever lived—and one of the truest hearts, that ever beat for America, by Congress—and the appointment of General Gates, to the command of the Northern army—Gramy Gates, as he was called—a talkative, pleasant old gentleman— who is remembered now, rather for his good fortune, than his generalship. General Arnold, the traitor, had also begun, about this time, to make a noise in our camp—several desperate affairs on land and sea, had made him a subject of universal attention—and, had he been a better principled man—a religious one—not a pretender—he would have ranked with the foremost of our heroes. His courage, however, sometimes degenerated into rashness—and his singular good conduct, to downwright madness. But still, our little army encreased so slowly, that the month of June, was about to open upon us, without our having the power to strike a blow. And often since, in reflecting on this season, I have thought it past all explanation, that Sir William Howe should have been ignorant of our weakness; and I have wondered why he did not make a dash into our very encampment, months before he manifested any disposition of the kind. But so it was—we slept upon our oars, from necessity—he upon his, from choice; and while we drifted down the current, about the same distance and relationship were preserved, for months and months, when a few stout pulls on his part, would have brought him along side. During this state of indolent suspense, two or three slight affairs took place in our parties, just sufficient to keep us awake, and talking, within our entrenchments, but nothing of any note except at Sag-Harbour—a smart decided thing. So— let us return to our story—. I shall take it up, at the time that I first saw Clinton, face to face, which was about six weeks after his return to camp—and nearly three months from the time of his would—perhaps nearly four. He was an altered man; and the intercourse that had once subsisted between him and Archibald, who had now become one of the heartiest and strongest, as well as most active young fellows in the army—seemed to be entirely forgotten. There was no sign of recognition between them, not a word nor a look—but, in the deep blue eyes of Archibald, and the dark flashing balls of Clinton, there was a mute expression of mortal antipathy, or at least, so I thought, whenever they passed each other. Clinton, I observed, was perpetually practising with the small sword; and Archibald, it was thought, had no equal now in the army. Every leisure moment was spent in the exercise—and I was constantly on the watch—together with Rodman, to prevent the deadly contention that seemed about to place. But I never spoke of it to Archibald; or rather, he would never permit me to approach the subject, though I tried, repeatedly, to sound him. Nor could Arthur, whose intrepid, heroick calmness, led him directly to the point, when he bore down like a tempest upon the doctrine of false honour—nor could he provoke my brother to utter one word in their defence. Clinton too, though an altered man—was fuller of levity than ever; but it was a bitter and sarcastick levity, and such as, I should think, would escape from the heart of a high blooded profligate, mortified and cut to the soul, by some unknown, unforeseen disappointment:—but his voice was louder than ever—his carriage, more imperious than ever—his jovial, frelicksome manner, more delightful than ever—to them with whom he associated—and the leisure of the camp, his high stature, his acknowledged personal pre-eminence, and his perpetual absence, round the neighbourhood, were alarming indications of his nature—intrigue after intrigue, came to our ears—and one or two serious encounters—and often, have I seen him at a distance, reining his beautiful horse, like a centaur—as if the animal were a part of himself—all eyes upon him, every mouth repeating his name, as he rode, proudly and confidently, through his evolutions—when there would be a sudden change in his career—his arm would drop, he would heave his body back in the saddle, and sit for a moment, as if his thoughts were not upon the display, in which he was employed; and then, erecting himself suddenly again, as if ashamed of his absence, and impatient for action—he would strike his rowels, inch deep, into his horse, and shoot, like an arrow, along the whole line of tents: and often too, when I have heard the laugh and song in some officer's marquee, with the voice of Clinton ringing like a trumpet in the middle, it has suddenly died away; and if I could, by any means—and Arthur had observed the same thing—obtain a glimpse of his person in full—I was sure to find him dark and mournful—his attitude, like that of a man sick at heart, and absent in mind— scorning the noisy revel, in which he had been goaded by his proud, reluctant, tyrannical spirit, to participate; and scorning himself that he had participated—indeed, whenever I saw him, his face was thoughtful— not solemn—not stern—but thoughtful—until he saw himself observed, when his spirit would brighten outright, and the boisterous merriment of a soldier—rioting in his unquestioned dominion—would ring, with a startling loudness, upon the ear. But these things could not last long. The French gentleman, of whom I have before spoken, Monsieur du Coudray had become exceedingly fond of my brother, and swore impetuously, wherever he went, that there was'nt his match in America, at the small sword. Clinton heard of it, and one evening, as we all sat together, playing cards, Archibald, in a remarkable good humour; and Arthur, altogether the man that he had been for months before, his heart running over at the lips, VOL. I. 22 every word—a gentleman entered, and presented a note to my brother. He took it—read it—layed down a cigar that was in his mouth—faced the cards before him—without looking at the bearer—and wrote, with a pencil, upon the face `accepted.' The stranger retired—and Archibald played out his hand. Du Coudray, a creature brimful of chivalry, threw himself back in the seat; and, pretending to arrange the cards, sat for several minutes, studying the countenance of Archibald—and at last—tapping, first my brother's heart and then his own, said—`Monsieur—ah, ha! Monsieur!—Je suis à vous!—ne m'oubliez pas!' `No,' said my brother—as if he understood him,— `no—there is my hand on it. He says fencing, not fighting, sir.' The frenchman smiled—lifted his eyes—made a motion with his hand, as if to lunge to the very hilt— shrugged—and returned to his cards. `Brother,' said I—`it is time to be serious; what is the meaning of this? I cannot remain silent—I cannot pretend to misunderstand you.' `Well then,' he replied, smiling—`Clinton is disposed to fence a little with me—have you any objection?' `With foils?—brother—or blades?' `Foils, I suppose,' was the reply, `for he speaks of doing it to-morrow, before some of his companions— and he could hardly think of that, if there were any thing very serious in his thought.' `I am not so sure of that,' said Arthur, `and, happen what will, I shall go with you.' `And I, brother.' `For,' continued Arthur—`I don't like all this preparation—there is some trick in it. We know the rules of the camp—and while Washington commands, we cannot fight.' `Very well, then—come brother, 'tis your deal— you shall go with us—Ha! Rodman—don't look at your cards—face the trump, man—what the deu ails you?—well, Coudray—(sorting his cards)—I hope you have something—you lead, you know— come.' One trick was taken—in silence;—when the next came, Archibald jumped up from his chair, crying— `why! what a blunderhead! the game was ours—ah, poor Coudray, you will never learn the vile game— how many times, I have told you not to lead from a king and knave—or ace, queen—there! just what I expected.' I looked up, and was satisfied. Could a man feign so well? no, it was impossible, the passionate eagerness, that he felt in the game was natural—my heart was easy from that moment. I felt that he could not have any deadly intention in his. Du Coudray too, threw down his cards, with a smile, and began a conversation about the movements of Congress, who had adjourned to Philadelphia. It appeared that he had joined our cause, as a volunteer; and that his influence had been so great in France, as to induce several fine spirited young fellows, of high rank, to stake their fortune with him. He had been made inspector-general of ordnance in our staff, with the rank of major general; but some jealousies having arisen, the noble fellow, had just written a letter to Congress, offering to accept the rank of captain for himself; and that of ensigns and lieutenants, for the few of his friends, who had thrown up their rank at home, to accompany him in this perilous adventure. The intelligent countenance, and dark eyes of the young Frenchman were full of the deepest expression, while he was engaged on this subject; but it vanished, instantly, when he arose—as if giving place to some thought yet deeper—and he shook my brother's hand more seriously, I thought, than the occasion seemed to demand. I took Archibald's arm, soon after, and led him out in front of the tent, where we could talk together, awhile, without the risk of interruption. `How has Clinton succeeded?' said I—`you never-speak of the family of late; yet something must have happened—I am sure of it—for you have heard from them, and yet have never told me what. Nay, if I pain you—I will forbear—I do not ask you how Clara is—or Lucia, or—.' `Lucia and Clara are both well,' said he, firmly, `Why do you never speak of her, then?' `Of Lucia you mean?' said he. `Yes—I am sure that she loves you.' `So am I,' said he. `And that she has cut Clinton adrift, on account of her love for you.' `I have no doubt of it,' he answered, in the same tone—. `And what do you mean to do Archibald?' `Nothing,' he replied. `But surely,' I continued, willing to probe his heart, no matter how deeply, so that I could touch the place, where all his hatred of Clinton lay, `surely, you cannot have forgotten her?' `Forgotten her? brother—' said he, facing upon me—putting both of his hands upon my shoulders, and looking me steadily in the eyes—`You have some design in that question; you never could ask it else; it never came from your heart; what is it?' `I would know, dear Archibald,' said I—`if you have forgiven Clinton.' `Then why not say so, John—why not say so at once? I should not wince; or prevaricate. No—I have not forgiven him. I cannot forgive him. He broke in upon the only heritage that I had—and spoiled it, with fire and sword. He took the only dear one—the only unspeakably dear one, of all this world, from me—the heart of—of—Lucia. She loved me—and he knew it. Yet he took advantage of her proud temper, a peevish moment, such as they, that love truest, will have, now and then. And—poor Lucia! she believed that he had supplanted me. I knew better—I knew her well. I expected to see the earth give way under their feet; yet, in my hushed agony, I prayed so long, and so devoutly, that it might not be—for her sake—that at last I had persuaded myself that it would not be; and that she, whom I most loved, of all created things—she, whom he had taken out of my heart, almost without desiring it—certainly, without knowing aught of her value, and, assuredly, judging of her as a wanton—that she might yet he happy in his arms. I ought not to have prayed it. I ought not to have believed it. I ought to have known better. I ought to have known that the woman who has once loved Archibald Oadley, can never love another man. John, John—I cannot forgive him. Yet, for her sake, I would not lift my hand against him. Nay, not so fast. I deserve no thanks. I shall not provoke him; not throw myself in his way; but mark me, I do not promise, that, if he put himself, wilfully, in mine—I shall not, as I once threatened, to do my best, to bring his proud forehead to the dust. You tremble. I know your sentiments on duelling— and those of Arthur—and you know mine. You are disturbed. I do not wonder. You are the only living creature that knows my real thought. No—I cannot forgive him. For myself—for all that I have suffered, though it is bitter, to be supplanted in a few hours—no matter by what hellish stratagem—no matter by what accident—after a few hours, by a stranger—Yet I could forgive that—as I am a living man, I could, I call God to witness it, brother—I could—but I cannot, I will not forgive his profligacy—his—I cannot proceed—I have spilt my blood for that family, and I am willing to spill it again—Dishonour—.' `Your eyes are frightfully brilliant, brother—what have you to complain of? The dishonour is his—not her's. She has stood up, when he lay prostrate at her feet, and refused him—him! that never sued to woman before in vain.' `I know it! and I bless her for it,' cried Archibald, wringing my hand—`I know it! I know it! I love her for it, more than ever! Nay, she did more—she tended him through his illness—wept over him, prayed with him, watched with him, gave him every opportunity that a lover could wish—and yet—O, righteous heaven! VOL. I. 22* what a magnificent heart, had that man once within his reach, had he only known its value!—yet, she refused him again and again. Nay, when he was in health— backed by all his beauty, and pride, and sorrow, and penitence—the solicitation of all her friends, the sincerest love, tears from a man that never shed tears before, at the foot of woman—the remembrance of past tenderness, and the belief that she should never see him more—nor me—yet, she stood upright, before all her family, and calmly put aside the naked heart, that he offered too—upon his knees. God bless her for it!' `Bitterly, bitterly hath she repented of her rashness.' said I, `Yet—yet—there is something more than humiliation required, to bring back the proud heart of Archibald, I fear. He has no compassion for frailty— no forgiveness for a sin like hers—no mercy—O my brother!' —I fell upon his neck, awestruck, at the solemnity of his eyes; they were severe and terrible— unrelenting as death. `Do you utterly abandon her?' said I. `You have no right to ask that question,' he replied, `no man living, not even her own father, has the right to — yet, I will answer it; I do not mean to abandon her—what more? Ask me no questions. I shall answer no more. Henceforth, I go alone, to accomplish the thought of my heart. She has suffered—she must suffer more; how much, I cannot pretend to say —but enough to make her a reasonable creature.' `Yet, Clinton has no hope,' said I. `None—I could have told him so, before he asked her—none!' `And you love her?' `Yes—as never man loved woman.' `And she loves you, with all her heart and soul— without hope?' `Yes—so I believe.' `Brother—brother!' The sentinel here levelled at us, and would have fired, but for my timely recollection. He had challenged already, it seems, but we had not heard him.</field>

Homer. * * I should have written this in Greek; but the translation that I have given, though not altogether so fashionable or learned, as some that have been made, and are used on like occasions, will be now intelligible to every body. If it should be thought so, I shall be amply rewarded for all my trouble, in making myself entirely acquainted with the original. It is altogether truer than Pope's. `There!' said Du Coudray, stooping as he entered our log hut, `there, monsieur! ce sont charmants, les fleurets, voila!' laying two pair of glittering foils upon the table—`ce sont excellents!' Archibald took up one; and, putting his finger upon the button, asked, why he brought two pair? `O, mon dieu? peutêtre, il vous faut plus que deux.' `Very well—come monsieur, lead on; come brother —come Arthur; all ready, monsieur.' `Oui, tout, il est pari,' said the Frenchman, leading us to the northern breastwork, and parapet. `Stirling!' cried he, facing the sentinel—who stopped, brought his fire-lock, smartly, to a present, and then continued his walk. We soon came to a place that had evidently been prepared for the occasion; the snow was levelled, and covered with saw dust, all about—and, in the centre, trodden as smooth and level, as the platform, over which we had passed; Clinton's friends were already on the ground, with countenances that looked very little like play. `I don't much like that man,' said Arthur; `look to your arms.' I turned in the direction of his eyes, and saw a thin spare man, with very black eyes, scowling at us; his cocked hat pushed on one side, as if in defiance, so as to reveal two very deep scars upon his forehead; and his hand resting upon the hilt of a horseman's sword, almost as tall as Archibald. Monsieur Du Coudray seemed, by a sort of tacit acquiescence, or rather invitation, to be invested with the rank of marshal for the occasion; and, no light honour did he appear to esteem it; for he gave his orders with the peremptory air of a field marshal; arranged the masks, crossed the foils, and posted the spectators, like one, experienced in all matters of ceremony. Clinton's eyes were insufferably haughty; and I could not, for my soul, dispossess myself of a belief, that he had come prepared for something serious; yet there was a bitter pleasantry in some of his jibes, and a sarcastick, keen irony of tone, that betokened the most perfect self-possesion, all the while: but harken to the sequel. Archibald took his position; both had taken off their boots and coats, and were standing in their slippers; when Clinton, casting his eyes on the tall, black eyed man, of whom I had just spoken, seemed to request his interference. He stepped forward, insolently enough, in front of Archibald; and, with a sneer, which caused Archibald's forehead to contract, and his lip to writhe; asked him if he had any disposition to take the `mure' first. Du Coudray smiled, while his dark eyes flashed fire at the interference; and he remarked, with a shrug, that, in France, that was the last ceremony: `apres qu'on a tiré—absolument la dernier.' The stranger seemed exceedingly disposed to quarrel; and I was just on the point of tapping him on the shoulder, when Arthur walked up to him, and looking him full in the face, begged to know, what business he had to interfere. The other stepped back, and struck the hilt of his sabre. Arthur smiled, folded his arms, and measured him from head to foot. `Sir,' said he, `I see that you are disposed to quarrel. There shall be no quarrelling here, till that affair is settled; after that, if you are troublesome—aye, or any of you, I shall take you in hand.' The other coolly unsheathed his hanger, and made a motion for Arthur to follow him. But ere the motion was complete, Archibald, Du Coudray, myself, Clinton, and two others, stood, sword in hand, and almost foot to foot. `Stop,' said Archibald, `stop! if you have a notion of fighting, we are ready to indulge you. If broad-sword, let us mount our horses, and do the thing handsomely; if small sword, one at a time will be the pleasantest; and I—I will fight the whole of you, one after the other, with pleasure.' Clinton interfered, however, at once—resolutely, and, with an air of command that soon brought these mettlesome gentry to their senses; and the foils were soon after resumed—the salute gone through with, and they began to play. Not a breath could be heard; the Frenchman stood, like some one contemplating a game for his own life— his eager eyes streaming with fire. `Ah, a hit!' said the tall stranger. Du Coudray shrugged his shoulders—`oui, touche!' `Another, another!' said the stranger; `no! said Archibald, calmly, `no, the first was a fair hit; the second, only a touch in the sword arm—and the third, no hit at all, though a very hazardous experiment.' `How hazardous?' said Clinton, sharply; `so hazardous,' answered Archibald, in a low, deliberate voice, `that I could parry and hit you, every time, that you should do it.' `Damn — a —' said Clinton, getting warm, yet ashamed to own it; `let us try again.' `No, pardon me—that would not be a fair game for you; but I give you leave to do it, whenever you please, without notice.' They began to play again. `There! that I suppose was no hit?' said Clinton, peevishly. `It certainly was not,' said Archibald. `Black the foils,' said Clinton, flinging his, to one of the officers, with an angry expression of contempt. I looked at Archibald; his attitude was singularly composed and graceful—the muscles of his arm, the sleeve of which, was rolled up, showing spiritedly, as he continued pressing upon his foil: I never saw such an arm, it was a limb of knotted serpents. But Du Coudray could not restrain his impatience— he looked vexed, mortified, beyond all expression. The foils were blacked; and, I observed that the feet of Clinton and Archibald, as they came upon guard, sounded with a more than common emphasis; their eyes, too, were fiercer, than when they began. Clinton pressed him hotly, and the play was beautiful, for more than a minute; when suddenly, Clinton's foil flew out of his hand, and Archibald, was bent, nearly double, against his breast. `Foul play!' said the stranger, interfering. `No, Sir,' said Du Coudray, fronting him, fiercely; `no foul play—pardon! he may disarm, and strike too —pardon, monsieur.' Clinton was red with shame and vexation; but Archibald remarked, with a tone of much kindness, that he did not intend to disarm him. `To be sure,' said Clinton, laughing, but very bitterly; `no man that breathes, could disarm me. You smile Sir—what do you mean by it?' `Do you insist on knowing?' `Yes, Sir.' `Why, Sir, I can disarm you as fast as you can pick up your foil, if you will only lunge at me—unless you have a bridle in your glove.' (This was said with marked emphasis;—and Clinton turned pale, but did not reply.) `Or wrap a pocket hankerchief about the guard'— Du Coudray came to me—rubbing his hands; and telling me, as well as he could, that now, he understood it all; that Clinton could not have held his sword a moment, unless he had a bridle in his palm, and that now we should see some sport.' Another round followed, with great spirit, and Archibald was hit—acknowledged it, by putting his hand upon his left side; but, before I could wink, he had returned it. And so it continued for several minutes, until the sweat streamed from both their faces—Archibald uniformly returning the hit, instantly, after receiving it, while Du Coudray could not stand still, for his life. `Two and two,' said Du Coudray. `No.' said the stranger—`three to two.' Archibald smiled; stepped back, and as Clinton followed, lunged and hit him. Du Coudray clapped his hands—`tree to tree, now sair! I suppose?' said he. I wondered at Archibald's coolness and self possession: It seemed impossible that he could look so, unless sure of his superiority, and yet—where was it? `You smile,' said Clinton—`my attitude does'nt please you?' `No,' Archibald replied. `You are a little careless. You don't come upon guard, after lunging.' `And what else?' said Clinton, with a sneer. `Several things Sir—' said Archibald, beginning to pull off his gloves, and look about for his coat. `Stop Sir,' said the imperious Colonel—`stop! I have not done with you yet. I cannot let you escape thus.' `La plus belle!' said Du Coudray, handing Archibald the foil. `Colonel Clinton—' said Archibald. `You are mistaken. You cannot beat me. I am more than a match for you.' The Colonel stamped with vexation and yet, there was, at the same time, a pleasant expression in his countenance, as he turned toward the tall man, and wiped the dust from his foil. `But you were pleased to tell me'—said Clinton— ironically—`of some faults that I had fallen into---I should be proud of any further information, from a master.' Archibald, with the most innocent face in the world, just as if he took it all in downright earnest---replied--- `Colonel Clinton has been out of play too long. You hold your arm too high. I could give you the quatre bas whenever I pleased. When you coupiz too, quatre and tierce, you are too low; you never press on my sword first---and do it so widely, that I should be sure to hit you, if I lunged straight forward. You hold your hand too low for the circle---and double,--and you degage like a school boy.' `Hell and the devil!' cried Clinton---`what do you take me for?' `A fifth rate player,' said Archihald, patiently.--- Clinton struck at him---and, as Archibald caught the blow---came upon guard, and then lunged furiously, several times. `The button is off!' cried Arthur---`stop! stop.' `The button is off!' `Never mind,' said Archibald—disarming Clinton again, while Du Coudray picked up the foil. `It is broken,' said Arthur. `Never mind; it is all the same to me,' said Archibald, in a tone of stinging sarcasm—`and if I mistake not, much the same to Colonel Clinton.' Clinton could bear it no longer—he foamed at the mouth—his forehead turned red as blood, and he was hoarse with passion. `You think that you can hit me?' said he—fiercely. `Yos—a hundred times running—' was the reply. `Break the button off your foil, if you dare, then.' `Are you serious?' `Perfectly,' said Clinton, aiming a blow at him, (not with the point) that Archibald caught, like lightning. `With all my heart then—' said he, stepping back— `brother, stand back—Arthur stand back—Du Coudray take your stand with them—hand to hilt; let no man interfere; for, by the living God! (snapping off the button, as he spoke)—I'll not spare my own brother, if he cross me now. You know how I have forborne, till human patience could forbear no longer.' We ranged ourselves immediately, with flashing eyes, opposite the three strangers; Arthur, I observed, as he drew his sword, planting himself, face to face, with the black-eyed one—I expected to see blood spilt—other blood than Archibald's—a single word would have sent us to the encounter. Clinton and Archibald stood eyeing each other, and feeling their points. The stranger took out a couple of files from his pocket, and offered to sharpen them. Du Coudray glanced at my brother, significantly, who immediately threw his foil to the wretch, for the purpose—and observed, taking up the buttons, and seeing, how near to the point they had been broken off—`that there had been some delicate management there—I observed a little of it—did you file them Du Coudray?' `No,' he replied—taking one of them. On examining, we found that the point had been filed down, so that they could not but break. He looked about us for explanation; but my brother smiled darkly, and bade him beware, hereafter, how he lent his foils. The truth now broke upon us. It was a preconcerted plan. The gallant Frenchman had been made the instrument of a deadly preparation;----the foils had been borrowed by some of Clinton's friends, and filed, so that a duel might be fought, in the heat of fencing, under pretence of accident. The whole mystery was now explained— VOL. I. 23 and when the mortal combatants came upon guard, for the last time, I felt my blood run cold. They crossed their swords—and then, as if each had a word or two to say in kindness, to the other, the memory of past times—the same love—the same battles—the—before they drove at each others hearts— they both spoke. `Archibald!' `Clinton!' `I owe you no hatred,' said Clinton—`but it is too late. Are you prepared?' `Fully—but stop a moment. If you play as badly now, as you did before we broke the buttons off---I foresee that it will be fatal to you. I do not want to run you through---but I shall do it. Nay, do not be impatient---suppose you wrap a handkerchief round your guard.' Clinton's nostrils dilated with scorn. `Come on!' said he, `come on!' advancing with an incessant motion. Away went his sword---but as Archibald did not follow him up, he recovered it again, and came upon guard, in a masterly style—so masterly, that Archibald's eyes sparkled with pleasure. They renewed the combat, and Clinton's sword entered Archibald's neck, when, it appeared to me that, if he had straightened his arm, he would have run Clinton through the body. `That was awkwardly done,' said Archibald, dropping the point, and stepping back----after Clinton withdrew his; and the blood spouted out, as if an artery had been wounded. `You were entirely at my mercy--- I---you had better stop.' Whether it was the sight of his own blood, or the sense of his danger that did it, I know not, but his voice and look were terrible, as he uttered the words, in a low murmuring voice---`you had better stop.' `Stop,' cried Clinton---with a scornful bitterness--- as if Archibald had been crying for mercy. `Mistaken man.' He pressed upon him again, but Archibald continued for several minutes, as it appeared to me, to parry his thrusts with consummate dexterity---returning none---and not even making a repose, in which Du Coudray had often said that he was unrivalled for his quickness and brilliancy---until both dropped their foils again—and stood panting, as if their veins would burst, the sweat running from their foreheads, and their hair wringing wet, though it was an exceedingly cold day. `Now then!' said Clinton---approaching Archibald again, with a mortal paleness about the lips---`now then for the last round?' `The last!' said Archibald, retreating---with a fixed eye---while Du Coudray could not forbear watching every movement of his arm---Clinton rushed upon him, and played his weapon with an incessant flash---and then there was a word or two passed between them---a pause---and the name of Lucia Arnauld was pronounced by Clinton, I believe, with some other word, I know not what---but Archibald leaped from the ground, as if wounded---saying, in a voice, that went through and through me. `Your blood be upon your own head!' It was but a word and a blow---a death blow---for Archibald sprang from the ground---their blades flashed fire, and rung---the guards struck---Clinton's flew twenty feet high in the air—breaking into several pieces, and Archibald's hilt sounded upon his breast. Clinton threw up his arms, the sword snapped in his body, and he fell dead upon the spot. For a moment, there was a silence like that of the grave. Not a motion nor a breath was heard. We stood appalled and thunder-struck, at the suddenness of the catastrophe—but, the next moment, a loud, deep sob came from the body—it shuddered—rolled over, with its mouth full of blood and saw dust—the face upward— and never stirred again. Archibald stood over it—as if struck blind—the broken foil in his hand, bright as silver, though it had just been withdrawn from the vitals of a human being —then—looking about upon us—like a murderer— he stood, as if---as if frightened at the sound of his own tread in the snow---afraid to trust his own voice —glanced at the broken weapon—which dropped from his hand—as if it were death-struck—covered his face, and walked out into the open air—followed by Du Coudray, Arthur and myself. We had not gone twenty yards, when we heard the word of command, and, on looking up, found ourselves surrounded by a file of men. `Stand,' said the corporal of the guard. All obeyed but Archibald. `Your swords!' said he, advancing. Each of us obeyed, without a moments hesitation. But Archibald either did not understand him—or disdained to reply, for he passed on. `Make ready! present!' said the corporal. But Archibald never turned his head—and but for Du Coudray, who stepped before the men, with violent gesticulation, we should have had bloody work of it yet; —for they were on the very point of throwing their bullets into Archibald—and Arthur was ready to second me in any retaliation, however desperate. But the corporal had compassion on him, and went up to him politely, and begged his sword. `My sword!' said Archibald, staring at him—`are you mad?' `You are under arrest,' said the corporal. `All the gentlemen have given up their swords—and you must give up yours.' `Must I!' said Archibald, drawing it from the scabbard. `By God! I'll cleave the first man to the navel that puts himself in my way. Who sent you?' `The Commander in Chief,' said the corporal, stepping adroitly beyond his reach, and beckoning to the guards. `Lead me to him,' said Archibald—`and mark me—at your peril give sign or signal to the rascals there. Do it! and I'll make you a head shorter—whatever become of me—before mortal man can help you.' The corporal led on—with a martial step, and we followed—till we were in sight of Washington's quarters, when the corporal signified that my only brother and I were to enter, for the present.
