      <field name="fulltext">Ingleborough Hall CHAPTER I. In one of those sweet glens, half-pastoral, half-sylvan, which may be found in hundreds channelling the steep sides of the moorland hills, and sending down the tribute of their pure limestone springs to the broad rivers which fertilize, no less than they adorn, the lovely vales of Western Yorkshire, there may be seen to this day the ruins of an old dwelling-house, sitnate on a spot so picturesque, so wild, and yet so soft in its romantic features, that they would well repay the traveller for a brief halt, who but too often hurries onward in search of more remote yet certainly not greater beauties. The gorge, within the mouth of which the venerable pile is seated, opens into the broader valley of Wharfdale from the north-eastern side, enjoying the full light and warmth of the southern sunshine, and although very narrow at its origin, where its crystal rivulet springs up from the lonely well-head, fringed by a few low shrubs of birch and alder, expands here at its month into a pretty amphitheatre or basin of a few acres' circuit. A wild and feathery coppice of oak and birch and hazel, with here and there a mountain ash showing its bright red berries through the rich foliage, clothes all the lower part of the surrounding slopes; while, far above, the seamed and shattered faces of the grey slaty limestone rise up like artificial walls, their summits crowned with the fair purple heather, and every nook and cranny in their sides crowded with odorous wild flowers. Within the circuits of these natural limits, sheltering it from every wind of Heaven except the gentle south, the turf lies smooth and even, as if it were a cultured lawn; while a few rare exotic shrubs, now all run out of shape and bare and straggling, indicate yet the time when it was a fair shrubbery, tended by gentle hands, and visited by young and lovely beings, now cold in their untimely sepulchres. The streamlet, which comes gushing down the glen, with its clear copious flow, boiling and murmuring about the large grey boulders, which everywhere obstruct its channel, making a thousand mimic cataracts, and wakening ever a wild mirthful music, sweeps here quite close to the foot of the eastern cliff, the feathery branches of the oakwood dipping their foliage in its eddies; and then, just as it issues forth into the open champaign, wheels round in a half circle completely isolating the little amphitheatre above mentioned, except at one point, hard beneath the opposite hill-face, where a small winding horse-track, engrossing the whole space between the streamlet and the limestone rock, gives access to the lone demesne. A small green hillock sloping down gently to the southward fills the embracing arms of the bright brook, around the northern hase of which is scattered a little grove of the most magnificent and noblest syeamores that I have ever seen; but on the other side, which yet retains its pristine character of a smooth open lawn, there are no obstacles to the view over the wide valley, except three old guarled thorn-bushes, uncommon from their size and the dense luxuriance of their matted greenery. It was upon the summit of this little knoll that the old homestead stood, whose massive ruins of red freestone, all over-grown with briers and tall rank grass and dock leaves, deface the spot which they adorned of old; and, when it was erect in all its fair proportions, the scene which it overlooked and its own natural attractions rendered it one of the loveliest residences in all the north of England. The wide rich gentle valley, all meadow land or pasture, without one brown ploughed field to mar its velvet green, the tall thick hawthorn hedges with their long lines of hedgerow timber, oak, ash, and elm, waking above the smooth enclosures; the broad clear tranquil river flashing out like a silver mirror through the green foliage; the scattered farm-houses, each nestled as it were among its sheltering orchards; the village spire shooting up from the clump of giant elms, which overshadow the old grave-yard; the steep long slope on the other side of the vale, or strath as it would be called in Scotland, all mapped out to the eye with its green fences, and wide hanging woods; and far beyond the rounded summits of the huge moorland hills, ridge above ridge, purple, and grand, and massive, but less and less distinct, as they recede from the eye, and melt away at last into the far blue distance—such was the picture, which its windows overlooked of old, and which still laughs as gaily as of yore, in the glad sunshine, around its mouldering walls and lonely hearth-stone. But if it is fair now, and lovely, what was it, as it showed in the good old days of King Charles, before the iron hand of civil war had pressed so heavily on England? The groves of sycamores stood there, as they stand now in the prime and luxuriance of their sylvan manhood; for they are now waxing aged, and somewhat grey and stag-horned; and the thorn bushes sheltered as they do now, whole choirs of thrushes and blackbirds; but all the turf, beneath the scattered trees, and on the sunny slope, was shorn, and rolled, and watered, that it was smooth and even, and far softer than the most costly carpet that ever wooed the step of Persian beauty. The Hall was a square building, not very large, and of the old Elizabethan style, with two irregular additions—wings as they might be called—of the same architecture, though of a later period; and its deep-embayed oriel windows, with their fantastic millions of carved freestone, its tall quaint chimneys, and its low porch with overhanging canopy and clustered columns, rendered it singularly picturesque and striking. The little green within the gorge of the upper glen, which is so wildly beautiful in its present situation, left as it is to the unaided hand of nature, was then a perfeet paradise; for an exquisite taste had superintended its conversion into a sort of untrained garden—an ove, well used to note effects, had marked its natural capabilities, and adding artificial beauties, had never trenched upon the character of the spot by anything incongruous or startling. Rare plants, rich-flowering shrubs, and scented herbs, were indeed scattered with a lavish hand about its precincts, but were so scattered that they seemed the genuine production of the soil. The Spanish cistus had been taught to carpet the wild crags, in conjunction with the native thyme and heather; the arbutus and laurestinus had been brought from afar, to vie with the mountain-ash and holly; the clematis and the sweet scented vine blended their tendrils with the rich English honeysuckle and the luxuriant ivy; rare lotuses might be seen floating, with their azure-colored cups, and broad green leaves, upon the glassy basins, into which the mountain streamlet had been taught to expand, among the white wild water-lilies, and the bright yellow clusters of the marsh marigolds; roses of every hue and scent, from the dark crimson of Damascus to the pale blush of soft Provence, grew side by side with the wild wood-brier and eglatine; and many a rustic seat of mossy stone, or roots and unbarked branches, invited the loitering visitor in every shadowy angle. There was no spot, in all the north of England, whereon the winter frowned so lightly as on those sheltered precincts— there was no spot whereon spring smiled so early, and with so bright an aspect— wherein the summer so long lingered, pouring her gorgeous flowers, rich with her spicy breath, into the very lap of autumn. It was indeed a sweet spot, and as happy as it was sweet and beautiful; before the curse of civil war was poured upon the groaning land, with its dread train of foul and fiendish ministers; and yet it was not war, nor any of its direct consequences, that turned that happy home into a ruin and desolation. It was not war—unless the struggles of the human heart—the conflict of the fierce and turbulent passions—the strife of principles, of motives, of desires, within the secret soul, may be called war—as indeed they might, and that with no figurative tongue; for they are the hottest, the most devastating, the most fatal of all that bear that ominous and cruel appellation. Such was the aspect then of Ingleborough Hall, at the period when it was perhaps the most beautiful, and when, as is but too often the case, its beauties were on the very point of being brought to a close for ever. The family which owned the manor—for the possessions attached to the old homestead were large, and the authority arising from them extended over a large part of Upper Wharfdale, was one of those old English races, which, though not noble, in the literal sense of the word, are yet so ancient, and so indissolubly connected with the soil, that they may justly be comprised among the aristocracy of the land. The name was Saxon; and it was generally believed— and probably with truth—that the date of the name and of its connexion with that estate, was at the least coeval with the Conquest. To what circumstances it was owing, that the Hawkwoods, for such was the time-honored appellation of the race, had retained possession of their fair demesne, when all the land was allotted ont to feudal barons and fat priests, can never now be ascertained; nor does it indeed signify; yet that it was to some honorable cause, some service rendered, or some high exploit, may be fairly presumed from the fact, that the mitred potentate of Bolton Abbey, who levied his tythes fat and near, throughout those fertile valleys, had no claim on the fruits of Ingleborough. During the ages that had passed since the advent of the Norman William, the Hawkwoods had never lacked male representatives to sustain the dignity of their race; and gallantly had they sustained it; for in full many a lay and legend, aye! and in grave cold history itself, the name of Hawkwood might be found side by side with the more sonorous appellations of the Norman fendatories, the Ardens, and Manleverers, and Vaspasouns, which fill the chronicles of border warfare. At the period of which I write, however, the family had no male scion—the last heir male, Ralph Hawkwood, had died some years before, full of years and of domestic honors—a zealous sportsman, a loyal subject, a kind laudlord, a good friend—his lot had fallen in quiet times, and pleasant places; and he lived happily, and died in the arms of his family, at peace with all men. His wife, a calm, placid dame, who had in her young days been the beauty of the shire, survived him; and spent her whole time as she devoted her whole mind and spirit, in educating the two daughters, joint heiresses of the old manor-house, who were left by their father's death, two bright-eyed fair haired prattlers, dependent for protection on the strong love, but frail support, of their widowed mother. CHAPTER II. Years passed away, and with their flight the two fair children were matured into two sweet and lovely women; yet the same fleeting suns; which brought to them complete and perfect youth, were fraught to others with decay, and all the carking cares and querulous ailments of old age. The mother who had watched, with keen solicitude, over their budding infancy, over the promise of their lovely childhood, lived indeed; but lived not to see or understand the full accomplishment of that bright promise. Even before the elder girl had reached the dawn of womanhood, palsy had shaken the enfeebled limbs, and its accustomed follower—mental debility—had in no small degree impaired the intellect of her surviving parent; but long before her sister had reached her maturity, the limbs were helplessly immovable, the mind was wholly clouded and estrauged. It was not now the wandering and uncertain darkness, that flits across the veiled horizon of the mind alternately with vivid gleams, flashes of memory and intellect, brighter, perhaps, than ever visited the spirit, until its partial aberration had jaried its vital principles, it was that deep and utter torpor, blanker than sleep, and duller—for no dreams seem to mingle with its day-long lethargy—that absolute paralysis of all the faculties of soul and body, which is so beautifully painted by the great Roman satirist, as the Omni Membrorum damno major dementia, quo nec Nomina servorum, nec vultum agnoscit amici Curn quo præterita cœnavit nocte, nec illos Quos genuit, quos educit— that still, sad, patient, silent suffering, which sits from day to day in the one usual chair, unconscious of itself, and almost so of all around it; easily pleased by trifles, which it forgets as soon; deriving its sole real and tangible enjoyment from the doze in the summer sunshine, or by the sparkling hearth of winter. Such was the mother now—so utterly, so hopelessly dependent on those bright beings, whose infancy she had nursed so devotedly—and well was that devotedness now compensated; for day and night, winter and summer, did those sweet girls by turns watch over the frail querulous sexagenarian—never both leaving her at once, one sleeping while the other watched, attentive ever to her ceaseless cravings, patient and mild to meet her angry and uncalled for lamentations. You would have thought a seclusion so entire, from all society of their equals, must have prevented their acquiring those usual accomplishments, those necessary arts, which every English gentlewoman is presumed to possess, as things of course —that they must have grown up mere ignorant, unpolished country lasses, without taste or aspiration beyond the small routine of their dull daily duties—that long confinement must have broken the higher and more spiritual parts of their fine natural minds—that they must have become mere moping household drudges; and so to think would be so very natural, that it is by no means easy to conceive how it was brought to pass, that the very opposite of this should have been the result. The very opposite it was, however, —for as there were not in the whole West Riding two girls more beautiful than Annabel and Marian Hawkwood, so were there surely none so highly educated, so happy in themselves, so eminently calculated to render others happy. Accomplished as musicians, both, though Annabel especially, excelled in instrumental music, while her young sister was unrivalled in voice and execution as a songstress; both skilled in painting; and if not poetesses, in so much as to be stringers of words and rhymes, certainly such, and that, too, of no mean order, in the wider and far higher acceptation of the word, for their whole souls were attuned to the very highest key of sensibility; romantic, not in the weak and ordinary meaning of the term, but as admirers of all things high and pure and noble; worshippers of the beautiful, whether it were embodied in the scenery of their native glens, in the rock, the stream, the forest, the sunshine that clothed all of them in a rich garb of glory, or the dread storm that veiled them all in gloom and terror—or in the master-pieces of the schools of painting, and of sculpture—or in the pages of the great, the glorious of all ages—or in the deeds of men, perils encountered hardily, sufferings constantly endured, sorrows assuaged by charitable generosity. Such were they in the strain and tenor of their minds; gentle, moreover, as the gentlest of created things; humble to their inferiors, but with a proud and self-respecting and considerate humility; open and free and frank towards their equals, but proud, although not wanting in loyalty and proper reverence for the great, and almost haughty of demeanor to their superiors, when they encountered any such, which was, indeed, of rare and singular occurrence. It was a strange thing, indeed, that these lone girls should have possessed such characters; so strongly marked, so powerful, and striking—should have acquired accomplishments so many, and so various in their nature. It will appear, perhaps, even stranger to merely superficial thinkers, that the formation of these powerful characters had been for the most part brought about by the very circumstances which would at first have appeared most unpropitious—their solitary habits, namely, and their seclusion—almost absolute seclusion—from the gay world of fashion and of folly! The large and opulent county in which their patrimony lay, was indeed then, as now, studded with the estates, the manors, and the parks of the richest and the noblest of England's aristocracy; yet the deep glens and lofty moorlands among which Ingleborough Hall was situated, are even to this day a lonely and sequestered region; no great post-road winds through their devious passes, and although in the close vicinity of large and populous towns, they are, even in the nineteenth century, but little visited, and are occupied by a population singularly primitive and pastoral in all its thoughts and feelings. Much more then —in those days when carriages were seen but rarely beyond the streets of the metropolis, when roads were wild and rugged, and intercourse between the nearest places, unless of more than ordinary magnitude, difficult and uncertain—was that wild district to be deemed secluded. So much so, indeed, was this the case, that at the time of which I write there was not within the circle of some twenty miles, two families of equal rank, or filling the same station of society with the Hawkwoods. This, had the family been in such circumstances of domestic health and happiness as would have permitted the girls to mingle in the gaieties of the neighborhood, would have been a severe and serious misfortune; as they must, from the continual intercourse with their inferiors, have contracted, in a greater or less degree, a grossness both of mind and manner; and would, most probably, have fallen into that most destructive habit—destructive to the mind, I mean, and to all chance of progress or advancement—the love of queening it in low society. It was, therefore, under their circumstances, including the loss of one parent, and the entire bereavement of the other, fortunate in no small degree that they were compelled to seek their pleasures and their occupations, no less than their duties, within the sphere of the domestic circle. The mother, who was now so feeble and so helpless, though never a person of much intellectual energy, or indeed of much force of any kind, was yet in the highest sense of the word, a lady. She had seen something of the great world apart from the rural glens which witnessed her decline; had mingled with the gay and noble even at the court of England; and being possessed of more than ordinary beauty, had been a favorite, and in some degree, a belle. From her, then, had her daughters naturally and unconsciously imbibed that easy, graceful finish, which, more than all beside, is the true stamp of gentle birth and bearing. Long before children can be brought to comprehend general principles or rules of convention, they can and do acquire habits, by that strange tact of observance, which certainly commences at a stage so early of their young frail existence, that we cannot by any effort mark its first dawning—habits, which thus acquired can hardly be effaced at all—which will endure unaltered, and invariable, when tastes and practices, and modes of thought and action, contracted long, long afterward, have faded quite away and been forgotten. Thus was it then, with these young creatures, while they were yet mere girls, with all the pure right impulses of childhood bursting out fresh and fair, they had been trained up in the midst of high and honorable and correct associations—naught low, or mean, or little; naught selfish, or dishonest, or corrupt, had ever so much as come near to them; in the sight of virtue, and in the practice of politeness, they had shot up into maturity; and their maturity, of consequence, was virtuous and polished. In after years, devoted as they were to that sick mother, they had no chance of unlearning anything, and thus from day to day they went on gaining fresh graces, as it were, by deduction from the foregone teaching, and from the fact that purity and nature when united must be graceful— until the proudest courts of Europe could have shown nothing, even in their most difficult circles, that could surpass, even if it could vie with, the easy artless frankness, the soft and finished courtesy, the unabashed, yet modest grace, of those two mountain maidens. At the period when my sad tale commences—for it is no less sad than true— the sisters had just reached the young yet perfect bloom of mature womanhood— the elder, Annabel, having attained her twentieth summer, her sister Marian, being exactly one year younger; and certainly two sweeter or more lovely girls could not be pictured or imagined—not even in the brightest moments of the painter's or poet's inspiration. They were both tall and beautifully formed—both had sweet low-toned voices—that excellent thing in woman! but here all personal resemblance ended; for Annabel, the elder, had a complexion pure and transparent as the snow of the untrodden glacier before the sun had kissed it into roseate blushes, and quite as colorless—her features were of the finest classic outline, the smooth fair brow, the perfect Grecian nose, the short curve of the upper lip, the exquisite arch of the small mouth, the chiselled lines of the soft rounded chin, might have served for a model to a seniptor, whereby to mould a mountain nymph or Naiad. Her rich luxuriant hair was of a light and sunny brown, her eyes of a clear lustrous blue with a soft languid and half melancholy tenderness, for their more usual expression; which suited well with the calm placid air that was almost habitual to her beautiful features. To this no contrast more complete could have been offered, than by the widely different style of Marian's loveliness. Though younger than her sister, her figure was more full and rounded—so much so, that it reached the very point where symmetry is combined with voluptnousness; yet was there nothing in the least degree voluptuous or sensual in the expression of her bright artless face. Her forehead, higher than Annabel's and broader, was as smooth and as white as polished marble; her brows were well defined and black as ebony; as were the long, long lashes that fringed her laughing eyes —eyes of the brightest, lightest azure, that ever glanced with merriment or melted into love—her nose was small and delicate, but turned a little upward, so as to add, however, rather than detract from the tout ensemble of her arch, roguish beauty; her mouth was not very small, but exquisitely formed, with lips redder than anything in nature, to which lips can be well compared; and filled with teeth regular, white, and beautifully even. Fair as her sister's, and like hers, showing everywhere the tiny veins of azure meandering below the milky skin, Marian's complexion was yet as bright as morning, with faint rosy tints, and red warm blushes, succeeding one another, or vanishing away, and leaving the cheek pearly white, as one emotion followed and effaced another in her pure innocent mind. Her hair, profuse in its luxuriant flow, was of a deep, dark brown, that might almost have been called black—but for a thousand glancing golden lights, and warm rich shadows, that varied its smooth surface with the varying sunshine—and was worn in a thick, massive plait, low down in the neck behind, while on either side the brow it was trained off and taught to cluster in front of either tiny ear, in an abundant maze of interwoven curls, close and mysteriously eulaced, as are the tendrils of the wild vine, which fluttering on each warm and blushing cheek, fell down the swan-like neck in heavy natural ringlets. But to describe the features is to give no idea, in the least, of Marian's real beauty —there was a radiant, dazzling lustre, that leaped out of her every feature, lightening from her quick speaking eyes, and playing in the dimples of her bewitching smile, that so intoxicated the beholder, that he would dwell upon her face entranced; and know that it was lovely; and feel that it was far more lovely, far more enthralling, than any he had ever looked upon before, yet, when without the sphere of that enchantment, he would be all unable to say wherein consisted its unmatched attraction. Between the natural disposition and temperaments of the two sisters, there was, perhaps, even a wider difference than between the characteristics of their personal beauty, for Anuabel was calm and mild, and singularly placid; not in her manners only, but in the whole tenor of her thoughts, and words, and actions— there was a sort of gentle melancholy, that was not altogether melancholy either, pervading her every tone of voice, her every change of feature. She was not exactly grave, or pensive, or subdued; for she could smile very joyously at times, could act upon emergencies with readiness, and quickness, and decision; and was at all times prompt in the expression of her confirmed sentiments. But there was a very remarkable tranquillity in her mode of doing everything she did; betokening fully the presence of a decided principle, directing her at every step, so that she was rarely agitated, even by accidents of the most sudden and alarming character, and never actuated by any rapid impulse. The very opposite to this was Marian Hawkwood; for although quite as upright and pure-minded as her sister— and what is more, of a temper quite as amiable and sweet, yet was her mood as changeful as an April day; although it was more used to mirth and joyous laughter than to frowns or tears either, yet had she tears as ready at any tale of sorrow, as are the fountains of the spring-shower in the cloud, and eloquent frowns and eyes, that lightened their quick indignation. At any outrage, or oppression, or high-handed deed, her cheek would crimson with the tell-tale blood, her flesh would seem to thrill upon her bones, her voice would choke, and her eyes swim with sympathetic drops, whenever she read, or spoke, or heard of any noble deed, whether of gallant daring, or of heroic self-denial. Her tongue was prompt always as the sword of the knight-errant to shelter the defenceless, to shield the innocent, to right the wrouged, and sometimes to avenge the absent. Artless herself, and innocent in every thought and feeling, she set no guard on either, but as she felt and thought, so she spoke out and acted, fearless, even as she was unconscious of any wrong; defying misconstruction, and half inclined to doubt the possibility of evil in the minds of others; so foreign did it seem, and so impossible to her own natural, and, as it were, instinctive sense of right. Yet although such, in all respects, as I have striven to depict them, the one all quick and flashing impulse, the other all reflective and considerate principle, it was most wonderful how seldom there was any clashing of opinion, or diversity of judgment, as to what was to be done, what left undone, between the lovely sisters. Marian would, it is true, often jump at once to conclusions, and act as rapidly upon them too, at which the more reflective Annabel would arrive only after some consideration; but it did not occur more often than the one had reason to repent of her precipitation, than the other of her over-caution. Neither, indeed, had much cause for remorse of this kind at all; for all the impulses of the one, all the thoughts and principles of the other, were alike pure and kindly. With words, however, it was not quite the same; for it must be admitted, that Marian oftentimes said things, how unfrequently soever she did aught, which she would willingly have recalled afterwards. Not, indeed, that she ever said anything unkind, or wrong in itself, and rarely anything that could give pain to another, unless that pain were richly merited, indeed; but that she gradually came to learn—long before she learned to restrain her impulses—that it may be very often unwise to speak, what in itself is wise—and very often, if not wrong, yet certainly imprudent, and of evil consequence, to give loud utterance even to right opinions. CHAPTER III. Such were the persons, such the dispositions of the fair heiresses of Ingleborough at the time when they had attained the ages I have specified; and certainly, although their spheres of usefulness would have appeared, at first sight, circumscribed, and the range of their enjoyments very narrow, there rarely have been seen two happier or more useful beings than Annabel and Marian Hawkwood, in this wide world of sin and sorrow. The care of their bereaved and hapless parent occupied, it is true, the greater portion of their time; yet they found many leisure hours to devote to visiting the poor, aiding the wants of the needy, consoling the sorrows of those who mourned, and sympathizing with the pleasures of the happy, among their humble neighbors. To them this might be truly termed a work of love and pleasure; for it is questionable whether from any other source the lovely girls derived a higher or more satisfactory enjoyment, than from their tours of charity among their village pensioners. Next in the scale of happiness stood, doubtless, the society of the old vicar of that pastoral parish; a man who had been their father's friend and counsellor in those young days of college friendship, when the fresh heart is uppermost in all, and selfishness a dormant passion; a man old enough almost to have been their grandsire, but with a heart as young and as cheery as a boy's—an intellect accomplished in the deepest lore of the schools, both classical and scientific, and skilled thoroughly in all the niceties and graces of French, and Spanish, and Italian literature—a man who had known courts and camps, too, for a short space in his youth; who had seen much and suffered much, and yet enjoyed, not a little, in his acquaintance with the world; and who, from sights, and sufferings, and enjoyments, had learned that if there is much evil, there is yet more of good, even in this world—had learned, while rigid to his own faults, to be most lenient to his neighbor's failings—had learned that charity should be the fruit of wisdom!—and had learned all this only to practise it in all his daily walks, to inculcate it in all his weekly lessons. This aged man, and his scarce less aged wife, living hardly a stone's throw from the Hall, had grown almost to think themselves a portion of the family; and surely no blood kindred could have created stronger ties of kindness than had the familiarity of long acquaintance, the confidence of old hereditary love. Lower yet in the round of their enjoyments, but still a constant source of blameless satisfaction, were their books, their music, and their drawings; the management of their household, the cultivation of their lovely garden, the ministering to the wants of their loved birds and flowers. Thus, all sequestered and seclnded from the world, placed in the midst of onerous duties, and solicitudes almost innumerable, though they had never danced at a ball, nor blushed at the praise of their own beauty flowing from eloquent lips, nor listened to a lover's suit, queens might have envied the felicity, the calm pure peaceful happiness of Annabel and Marian. They were, indeed, too happy! I do not mean too happy to be virtuous, too happy to be mindful of and grateful to the Giver of all joy—but, as the common phrase runs, too happy for their happiness to be enduring. This is a strange belief —a wondrous superstition!—and yet it has been common to all ages. The Greeks, those wild poetical dreamers, imagined that their vain gods, made up of moral attributes, envied the bliss of men, fearing that wretched earthlings should vie in happiness with the possessors of Olympus. They sang in their dark mystic choruses, “That perfect bliss of men not childless dies, But, ended, leaves a progeny behind, Of woes, that spring from fairest fortune blind—” and, though their other doctrines of that insuperable destiny—that absolute necessity, to resist which is needless labor—and of ancestral guilt, through countless generations, would seem to militate against it, there was no more established faith, and no more prevalent opinion, than that unwonted fortunes were necessarily followed by most unusual woe. Hence, perhaps, the stern self-mortification of the middle ages—hence, certainly, the vulgar terror prevalent more or less among all classes, and in every time and country, that children are too beautiful, too prematurely clever, too good to be long-lived— that happiness is too great to be lasting— that mornings are too fine to augur stormless days! And we—aye! we ourselves—we of a better faith, and purer dispensation—we half believe all this, and more than half tremble at it, although, in truth, there is no cause for fear in the belief—since, if there be aught of truth in the mysterious creed, which facts do in a certain sense seem to bear out, we can but think, we cannot but perceive, that this is but a varied form of care and misery, vouchsafed by the Great All-perfect toward his frail creatures—that this is but a merciful provision, to hinder us from laying up for ourselves “treasures upon earth, where moth and rust do corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal”—a provision to restrain us from forgetting, in the small temporary bliss of the present, the boundless and incomparable beatitude of the future—to warn us against hartering, like Esau, our birthright for a mess of portage! But I am now called to follow out this train of thought, suggested by the change in the fortunes of those to whom I am performing the part of historian; by the change, I say, in their fortunes—a change, too, arising from the very circumstances, as is frequently the case, which seemed to promise the most fairly for their improvement and their permanence. Oh! how blind guides are we! even the most farsighted of us all!—how weak and senseless judges, even the most sagacious!— how false and erring prophets, even the wisest and the best! It was, as I have said already, somewhere late in the summer, wherefrom Annabel reckoned her twentieth and Marian her nineteenth year—very late in the last month of summer, an hour or two before the sunset of as beautiful an evening as ever smiled upon the face of the green earth. The sky was nearly cloudless, though a thin gauze-like haze had floated up from the horizon, and so far veiled the orb of the great sun, that the eye could gaze undazzled on his glories; and the whole air was full of a rich golden light, which flooded the level meadows with its lustre, except where they were checkered by the long cool blue shadows projected from the massive clumps of noble forest trees, which, singly or in groups, diversified the lonely vale, and gilded the tall slender steeple of the old village church, and glanced in living fire from the broad oriel windows of the Hall. Such was the evening, and so beautiful the prospect, with every sound and sight in perfect harmony—the sharp squeak of the rapid swifts, wheeling their airy circles around the distant spire, the full and liquid melodies of thrush and blackbird from out the thorn bushes upon the lawn, the lowing of the cows, returning from their pasture to pay the evening tribute, the very cawing of the homeward rooks, blended by distance into a continuous and soothing murmur, the rippling music of the stream, the low sound of the west wind in the foliage of the sycamores, the far shout of the children, happy at their release from school, the carol of a solitary milk-maid, combining to make up a music as sweet as can be heard or dreamed of by the sleeping poet. That lovely picture was surveyed, and that delicious melody was listened to, by eyes and ears well fitted to appreciate their loveliness, for at an open casement of a great parlor in the Hall, with furniture all covered with those elegant appliances of female industry— well executed drawings, and books, and instruments of music, and work-baskets, and frames for embroidery—which show so pleasantly that the apartment is one not of show, but of calm home-enjoyment —at an open casement sat Annabel, alone —for the presence of the frail paralytic being, who dozed in her arm-chair, at the further end of the room, cannot be held to constitute society. Marian, for the first time in her life, was absent from her home, on a visit, which had already endured nearly six weeks, to the only near relative of the family who was yet living—a younger sister of her mother—who had married many years ago a clergyman, whose piety and talents had raised him to a stall in the Cathedral Church of York, where he resided with his wife—a childless couple. This worthy pair had passed a portion of the summer at the Hall, and when returning to the metropolis of the county had prevailed on their younger niece, not altogether without difficulty, to go with them for a few weeks, and see a little society on a scale something more extended than that which her native vales could offer. It was the first time in their lives that the sisters had been parted for more than a few days, and now the hours were beginning to appear very long to Annabel; as weeks were running into months, and the gorgeous suns of summer were fast preparing to give place to the cold dews and frosty winds of autumn. The evening meal was over, and a solitary thing was that meal now, which used to be the most delightful of the day; and hastily did the lonely sister hurry it over, thinking all the while what might be Marian's occupation at the moment, and whether she too was engaged in thoughts concerning her far friends, and the fair home of her childhood. It was then, in a mood half melancholy and half listless, that Annabel was gazing from her window, down the broad valley to the eastward, marvelling at the beauty of the scenery, though she had noted every changing hue that flitted over the far purple hills a thousand times before; and listening to every sweet familiar sound; and yet, at the same time, pondering, as if she were quite unconscious of all that met her senses, about things which she fancied might be happening at York, when on a sudden, her attention was aroused by a dense cloud of dust, rising beyond the river, upon the line of the high road, and sweeping up the valley, with a progress so unusually rapid as to indicate that the objects, which it veiled from view, must be in more than commonly quick motion. For a few moments she watched this little marvel narrowly, but without any apprehension or even any solicitude; until, as it drew nearer, she could at times see bright flashes, as if of polished metal, gleaming out through the murky wreaths, and feathers waving in the air. The year was that, in which the hapless Charles, all hopes of reconciliation with his parliament being decidedly frustrated, displayed the banner of civil war, and drew the sword against his subjects. The rumors of the coming strife had circulated, like the dread subterraneous rumblings which harbinger the earthquake, through all the country far and near; sad omens of approaching evil! and more distinctly were they bruited through Yorkshire, in consequence of the attempt which had been made by the royal party to secure Hull, with all its magazines and shipping —frustrated by the energy and spirit of the Hothams—so that, as soon as she perceived that the dust was beyond all doubt stirred up by a small party of well-appointed horse, Annabel entertained no doubts as to the meaning, but many serious apprehensions as to the cause of the present visitation. CHAPTER IV. The road, by which the cavaliers were proceeding, through well-made and passable at all times, was no considerable thoroughfare; no large or important towns lay on its route; nay, no large villages were situated on its margin. It was a devious winding way, leading to many a homely farm-house, many a sequestered hamlet, and affording to the good rustics a means of carrying their wheat and eggs and butter, or driving their fat cattle and black-face moorland sheep to market; but it was not the direct line between any two points, or places, worthy even of a passing notice. It is true, that some twelve or fifteen miles down the valley there was a house or two tenanted by gentry—one that might by a liberal courtesy have been designated a castle; but above Ingleborough Hall, to northwestward, there was no manor-house or dwelling of the aristocracy at all, until the road left the ghylls— as those wild glens are designated—and joined the line of the great northern turnpike. It was extremely singular then, to say the least, that a gay troop of riders should appear suddenly in that wild spot, so far from anything that would be likely to attract them; and Annabel sat some time longer by the window, wondering, and at the same time fearing, although in truth she scarce knew what; until at a mile's distance she saw them halt, and after a few moments' conversation with a farming-man on the wayside, as if to inquire their route, turn suddenly down a narrow by-road leading to the high narrow bridge of many arches, which crossed the noble river and gave the only access to the secluded site of Ingleborough. When she saw this, however, her perturbation became very great; for well she knew that there lay nothing in that direction except one little market-town, far distant, and a few scattered farm-houses on the verge of the moors, so that there could be but little doubt that Ingleborough was indeed their destination. The very moment that she arrived at this conclusion, Annabel called a serving-man, and bade him run quick to the vicarage, and pray good Doctor Summers to come up to her instantly, as she was in great strait, and fain would speak with him; and at the same time, with an energy of character that hardly could have been expected from one so young and delicate, ordered the men of the household—including in those days the fowler and falconer, and half a dozen grooms and many a supernumerary more, whom we in these degenerate times have long discarded as incumbrances, to have their arms in readiness—for every manor-house then had its regular armory—and to prepare the great bell of the Hall, to summon all the tenants on the instant in case such proceedings should be needful. In a few moments the good grey-haired vicar came, almost breathless from the haste with which he had crossed the little space between the vicarage and the manor and a little while afterwards his wife followed him, anxious to learn as soon as possible what could have so disturbed the quiet tenor of a mind so regulated by high principles, and garrisoned by holy thoughts, as Annabel's. Their humble dwelling, though searce a stone's throw from the Hall, was screened by a projecting knoll feathered with dense and shadowy coppice, hiding from it entirely the road by which the horsemen were advancing; so that the worthy couple had not perceived, or suspected, anything, to justify the fears of Annabel, until they were both standing in her presence. Then, while the worthy doctor was proffering his assistance, and his good wife inquiring eagerly what was amiss, they caught sight of that gay company of cavaliers, with feathers waving and scarfs fluttering in the wind, and gold embroideries glancing to the sun; as, having left the dusty road, they wheeled through the green meadows and flashed suddenly upon their eyes—a spectacle as unexpected as it was gorgeous and exciting! “Who can they be? What possibly can bring them hither?” exclaimed Annabel, pointing with evident trepidation towards the rapidly approaching horsemen. “I fear—oh! I greatly fear some heavy ill is coming—but I have ordered all the men to take their arms, and the great bell will bring us twenty tenants in half as many minutes! What can it be, good doctor?” “Indeed I know not, Annabel,” replied the good man, smiling cheerfully as he spoke; “in truth I know not, nor can at all conjecture; but be quite sure of this, dear girl, that they will do, to us at least, no evil!—they are King Charles's men, without doubt, churchmen and cavaliers, all of them!—any one can see that! and, though I know not that we have much to fear from either party, from them at least we have no earthly cause for apprehension. I will go forth, however, to meet them; and to learn their errand—meantime, fear nothing.” “Oh! you mistake me,” she answered at once; “oh! you mistake me very much; for I did not even for a moment fear personally anything; it was for my poor mother I was first alarmed; and all our good neighbors; and indeed all the country around, that shows so beautiful and happy this fair evening!—oh! but this civil war is a dread thing; and dread I fear will be the reckoning of those who make it.” “Who make it without cause, my daughter! A dreadful thing it is at all times, but it may be a necessary, aye! and a holy thing—when freedom or religion are at stake! but we will talk of this at another time; for see, they have already reached the furthest gate, and I must speak with them before they enter here, let them be who they may.” And, with the words, pressing her hand with fatherly affection, “Farewell,” he said, “be of good cheer. I purpose to return forthwith.” And then he left the room, and hurrying down the steps of the porch, walked far more rapidly than seemed to suit his advanced years and sedentary habits, across the park to meet the gallant company. A gallant company, indeed, it was and such as was but rarely seen in that wild region—being the train of a young gentleman, of some eight or nine and twenty years, splendidly mounted, and dressed in the magnificent fashion of those days, in a half military costume; for his buff coat was lined throughout with rich white satin, and fringed and looped with silver, a falling collar of rich Flanders lace flowing down over his steel gorget, and a broad scarf of blue silk supporting his long silver-hilted rapier. By his side, rode another person, not certainly a menial servant, and yet clearly not a gentleman of birth and lineage; and after these, a dozen or more armed attendants followed, all wearing the blue searf and black feathers of the royalists, all nobly mounted, and accounted, like regular troopers, with sword and dagger, pistols and musquetoons, although they wore no breastplates, nor any sort of defensive annor. A brace of jet-black greyhounds, without a speck of white upon their sleek and glistening hides, ran bounding merrily beside their master's stirrup, and a magnificent goshawk sat hooded on his wrist, with silver bells and richly decorated jesses. So much had the ladies observed, even before the old man reached the party; but when he did so, and paused for a moment to address the leader, that gentleman immediately dismounted from his horse; and after shaking hands, cordially, the two advanced together, apparently engaged in eager conversation, toward the entrance of the hall. This went far, on the instant, to restore confidence to Annabel; but when they came so near that their faces could be seen distinctly from the windows, and she could mark a well-pleased smile upon the venerable features of her friend, she was completely reassured. A single glance-moreover, at the face of the stranger-showed her that the most timid maiden need hardly feel a moment's apprehension, even if he were her country's or her faction's foe; for it was not merely handsome, striking, and distinguished, but such as indicates, or is supposed to indicate, the presence of a kindly disposition and good heart. Annabel had not much time, indeed, for making observations at that time; for it was scarce a minute before they had ascended the short flight of steps, which led to the stone porch, and entered the door of the vestibule. A moment louger, and they came into the parlor, the worthy vicar leading the young man by the hand, as if he were a friend of ten years' standing. “Annabel,” he exclaimed, in a joyous voice, as he crossed the threshold of the room, “this is the young Lord de Vaux, son of your honored father's warmest and oldest friends, and in years long gone by but unforgotten, my kindest patron. He has come hither, bearing letters from his father—knowing not until now, that you, my child, were so long since bereaved— letters of commendation, praying the hospitality of Ingleborough, and the best influence of the name of Hawkwood, to levy men to serve King Charles, in the approaching war. I have already told him—” “How glad, how welcome, doubtless, would have been his coming”—answered Annabel, advancing easily to meet the youthful nobleman, although a deep blush covered all her pale features, as she performed her unaccustomed duty—“had my dear father been alive, or my poor mother”—casting a rapid glance towards the invalid—“been in health to greet him. As it is”—she continued, “the Lord de Vaux, I doubt not in the least, will pardon any imperfections in our hospitality, and believe if in aught we err, it will be error not of friendliness, or of feeling, but of experience only; seeing I am but a young mistress of a household. You, my kind friend, and Mistress Summers, will doubtless tarry with us, while my Lord de Vaux gives us the favor of his presence.” “Loath should I be, indeed, dear lady, thus to intrude upon your sorrows, could I at all avoid it,” replied the cavalier— “and charming, as it must needs be, to enjoy the hospitalities tendered by such an one as you, I do assure you, were I myself concerned alone, I would remount my horse at once, and ride away, rather than force myself upon your courtesy. But, when I tell you that my father's strong opinion holds it a matter of importance—importance almost vital—to the King, and to the cause of Church and State in England, that I should levy some force here of cavaliers—where there be so few heads of noble houses living—to act in union with Sir Philip Musgrave, in the north, and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale, I both trust and believe, that you will overlook the trouble and intrusion, in fair consideration of the motives which impel me.” “Pray,” said she, smiling gaily, “pray, my Lord de Vaux, let us now leave apology and compliment—most unaffectedly and truly, I am glad to receive you both as the son of my father's valued friend, and as a faithful servant of our most gracious king—we will do our best to entertain you; and Doctor Summers will aid you, with his counsel and experience, in furthering your military levies. How left you the good earl, your father? I have heard mine speak of him many times, and ever in the highest terms of praise, when I was but a little girl—and my poor mother much more recently; before this sad calamity affected her so fearfully.” Her answer, as it was intended, had the effect of putting an end to all formality, and setting the young nobleman completely at ease; the conversation took a general tone, and was maintained on all sides with sufficient spirit, until—when Annabel retired for a little space, to conduct her mother to her chamber—De Vaux found himself wondering how a mere country girl, who had lived a life so secluded and domestic, should have acquired graces, both of mind and manner, such as he never had discovered in court ladies; while she was struck, even in a greater degree, by the frank, unaffected bearing, the gay wit, and sparkling anecdote, blended with many a touch of deeper feeling, which characterized the youthful nobleman's conversation. After a little while she re-appeared; and, with her, was announced the evening meal, the pleasant, old-fashioned supper; and, as he sat beside her, while she presided, full of calm, modest self-possession, at the head of her hospitable board, with no one to encourage her, or lend her countenance, except the good old vicar and his homely help-mate, he could not but draw fresh comparisons, all in her favor, too, betwixt the quiet, graceful confidence of the ingenuous girl before him, and the minauderies and the meretricious airs of the court dames, who had been hitherto the objects of his passing admiration. Cheerfully, then, and pleasantly the evening passed away; and when upon her little couch, hard by the invalid's sick bed, Annabel thought over the events of the past day, she felt concerning young De Vaux, rather as if he had been an old familiar friend, with whom she had renewed an intercourse long interrupted; than as of a mere acquaintance, whom that day had first introduced, and whom the next might possibly remove for ever. Something there was, when they met next, at breakfast, on the following morning, of blushing bashfulness in Annabel, which he had not observed, nor she before experienced; but it passed rapidly away, and left her self-possessed and tranquil—while surely in the sparkling eye, the eager haste, with which he broke away from his conversation with Dr. Summers, as she entered—in his hand half extended, and then half awkwardly, half timidly withdrawn, there was much indication of excited feeling, widely at variance with the polite and even formal mannerism inculcated and practised in the court of the unhappy Charles. It needs not, however, to dwell on passing conversations, to narrate every trifling incident; the morning meal once finished, De Vaux mounted his horse, and rode forth in accordance with the directions of the loyal elergyman, to visit such among the neighboring farmers, as were most likely to be able to assist him in levying a horse regiment. A few hours passed; and he returned full of high spirits and hot confidence—he had met every here assurances of good will to the royal cause; had succeeded in enlisting some ten or more stout and hardy youths, and had no doubt of finally accomplishing the object which he had in view, to the full height of his aspirations. After dinner, which, in those primitive days, was served at noon, he was engaged for a time in making up despatches for his father, which having been sent off by one of his own trusty servants to the castle in Northumberlnd, he went out, and joined his lovely hostess in the sheltered garden, which I have described above; and there they lingered until the sun was sinking in the west, behind the huge and purple-headed hills that screened the horizon in that direction. The evening circle and the social meal succeeded; and when they parted for the night, if Annabel and young De Vaux could not be said to be enamored, as indeed they could not yet, they had at least made so much progress to that end, that each esteemed the other the most agreeable and charming person, it had been hitherto their fortune to encounter; and—although this was decidedly the furthest point to which the thoughts of Annabel extended—when he had lain down on his bed, with the sweet rays of the harvest moon flooding his room with quiet lustre, and the voice of the murmuring rivulet, and the low flutter of the west wind in the giant sycamores, blending themselves into a soft and soothing melody—the young lord found himself considering how gracefully that fair pale girl would fill the place which had been long left vacant by his mother in the grand hall of Gilsland Castle. CHAPTER V. Another and another day succeeded—a week slipped away—a second and a third followed it; and still the ranks of the royal regiment, though they were filled rapidly, had many vacancies, and arms had yet to be provided, and standards and musicians; messengers went and came continually between the castle and the manor, and all was haste and confusion in the lone glens of Wharfdale. Meantime a change was wrought in Annabel's demeanor, and all who saw remarked it— there was a brighter glow than ever had been seen before, in her transparent cheeks; her eyes sparkled almost as brilliantly as Marian's; her lips were frequently arrayed in bright and beaming smiles; her step was light and springy as a young fawn's on the mountain. Annabel was in love, and had discovered that she was so—Annabel was beloved and knew it—the young lord's declaration and the old earl's conseut had come together; and the sweet maiden's heart was given, and her hand promised, almost before the asking. Joy! joy! was there not joy in Ingleborough? The good old vicar's tranquil air of satisfaction; the loud and eloquent mirth of his kind hearted housewife—the merry, gay congratulations of wild Marian, who wrote from York, half crazy with excitement and delight—the evident and lovely happiness of the young promised bride —what pen of man may even aspire to write them. All was decided—all arranged—the marriage was, so far, at least, to be held private, that no festivities or public merriment should bruit it to the world, until the civil strife should be decided, and the king's power established; which all men fancied, at that day, it would by a single battle—and which, had Rupert wheeled upon the flank of Essex at Edge-Hill, instead of chasing the discomfited and flying horse of the Roundheads, miles from the field of battle, would probably have been the case. The old earl had sent the wedding gifts to his sou's chosen bride, had promised to be present at the nuptials, the day of which was fixed already; but it had been decided that when De Vaux should be forced to join the royal armies his young wife should continue to reside at Ingleborough, with her bereaved mother and fond sister, until the wished-for peace should unite England once again in bonds of general amity; and the bridegroom find honorable leisure to lead his wife in state to his paternal mansions. Days sped a way—how fast they seemed to fly to those young happy lovers! How was the very hour of their first interview noted, and marked with while in the deep tablets of their minds—how did they shyly, half, half fondly recount each to the other the first impressions of their growing fondness—how did they bless the cause that brought them thus together. proh cœca mens mortalium!—oh! the short-sighted scope of mortal vision! alas! for one —for both! The wedding day was fixed, and now was fast approaching; and hourly was Marian, with their good uncle and his dame, expected at the Hall, and wished for, and discoursed of by the lovers— “and oh!”—would Annabel say, half sportively, and half in earnest—“well was it for my happiness, De Vaux, that she was absent when you first came hither, for had you seen her first, her far superior beauty, her bright wild radiant face, her rare arch naivete, her flashing wit, and beautiful enthusiasm would—must have captivated you all at once—and what had then become of your poor Annabel?” And then would the young lord vow— that had he met her first in the most glorious courts of Europe, with all the gorgeous beauties of the world to rival her, she would alone have been the choice of his soul—his soul, first touched by her, of woman! And then he would ask in lowered tones, and with a sly simplicity of manner, whether if he had loved another, she could have still loved him; to which, with all the frank and fearless purity that was so beautiful a trait in Annabel—“Oh yes—” she would reply, and gaze with calm reliance, as she did so, into her lover's eyes—“oh yes, dear Eruest—and then how miserably wretched must I have been through my whole life hereafter. Oh! yes, I loved you—though then I knew it not, nor indeed thought at all about it, until you spoke to me—I loved you dearly!—and I believe it would almost have killed me to look upon you afterwards as the wife of another.” The wedding day was but a fortnight distant; and strange to say it was the very day, two months gone, which had seen their meeting. Wains had arrived from Gilsland, loaded with arms and uniforms, standards and ammunitions; two brothers of young De Vaux, young gallant cavaliers, had come, partly to officer the men, partly to do fit honor to their brother's nuptials. The day, although the season had now advanced far into brown October, was sunny, mild, and beautiful; the regiment had, for the first time, mustered in arms in Ingleborough park, and a gay show they made, with their glittering casques and corslets, fresh from the armorer's anvil, and their fluttering scarfs, and dancing plumes, and bright emblazoned banners. The sun was in the act of setting—De Vaux and Annabel were watching his decline from the same window in the Hall whence she had first discovered his unexpected coming; when, as on that all eventful evening, a little dust was seen arising on the high road beyond the river; and, in a moment, a small mounted party became visible, amidst which might be readily descried the fluttering of female garments! “It is my sister”—exclaimed Annabel, jumping up on the instant, and clasping her hands eagerly—“it is my dear, dear sister—come, Ernest, come, let us go and meet dear Marian.” No time was lost, but arm-in-arm the lovers sallied forth, and met the little train just on this side of the park-gate. Marian sprang from her horse, light as a spirit of the air, and rushed into her sister's arms, and clung there with a long and lingering embrace, and as she raised her head, a bright tear glittered on either silky eyelash. De Vaux advanced to greet her, but as he did so, earnestly perusing the lineaments of his fair future sister, he was most obviously embarrassed, his manner was confused, and even agitated, his words faltered—and she, whose face had been, a second before, beaming with the bright crimson of excitement—whose eye had looked round eagerly and gladly to mark the chosen of her sister—she turned as pale as ashes— brow, cheeks, and lips—pale, almost livid!—and her eye fell abashed, and did not rise again till he had finished speaking. None noticed it but Annabel; for all the party were engaged in gay congratulations, and—they recovering themselves immediately—nothing more passed, that could create surmise—but she did notice it, and her heart sauk for a moment, and all that evening she was unnsually grave and silent; and, had not her usual demeanor been so exceedingly calm and subdued, her strange dejection must have been seen, and wondered at, by her assembled kinsfolk. CHAPTER VI. The morning after Marian's arrival at the Manor, was one of those bright lovely dawns, sure harbingers of sweet and sunny days, that often interrupt the melancholy progress of an English autumn; fairer and softer, as the season waxed older, and more enchanting from the contrast, which they cannot fail to suggest, between their balmy mildness, and the chill winds and gloomy fogs of the approaching winter. The sky was altogether cloudless, yet it had nothing of the deep azure hue which it presents in summer, resembling in its tints and its transparency, a canopy, if such a thing could be, of living aqua-marine, and kindled by a flood of pure, pale yellow lustre. None of the trees were wholly leafless, though none, perhaps, unless it were a few old oaks, but had lost something of their summer foliage; and their changed colors varying from the deepest green, through all the shades of yellow, down to the darkest amber, although prophetic of their coming doom, and therefore saddening, with a sort of chastened spiritual sorrow, the heart of the observer, added a solemn beauty to the scenery, that well accorded with its grand and romantic character. The vast round-headed hills, seen through the filmy haze which floated over them, filling up their dells and hollows, showed every intermediate hue from the red russet of their heathery foreground, to the rich parple of their furthest peaks. The grass, which had not yet begun to lose its verdant freshness, was thickly meshed with gossamer, all sprinkled by the pure and plenteous dews, and flashing like a net of diamonds upon a ground of emerald velvet, to the early sunbeams. It was summer—late indeed in that lovely season, but still full summer, with all her garuiture of green, her pomp of full blown flowers—the glorious mature womanhood of the year! when Marian left her home. Not a trace of deeay or change was visible on its bright brow, not a leaf of its embroideries was altered, not a bud in its garland was blighted. She had returned; and everything, though beautiful and glowing, bore the plain stamp of approaching dissolution. The west wind blew as softly as in June through the tall sycamores, but after every breath, while all was lulled and peaceful, the broad sere leaves came whirling down from the shaken branches, on which their hold was now so slight, that but the whisper of a sigh was needed to detach them; the skies—the waters—were as pure as ever, as beautifully clear and lucid, but in their brightness there was a chill and glassy glitter, as different from their warm sheen under a July sun, as is the keen unnatural radiance of a blue eye in the consumptive girl, from its rich lustrous light in a mature and healthy woman. Was it the contemplation of this change that brought so sad a cloud over the brow of lovely Marian Hawkwood; so dull a gloom into her speaking eye; so dread a paleness upon the ripe damask of her cheek? Sad indeed always is such contemplation—sorrowful and grave thoughts must it awake in the minds of those who think the least, to revisit a fair well-known scene which they have quitted in the festal flush of summer, when all the loveliness they dwelt on so fondly is flown or flying. It brings a chill upon the spirit, like that which touches the last guest, “Who treads alone Some banquet hall deserted, Whose lights are fled, Whose garlands dead, And all save he departed.” It makes a passing anguish, like that which thrills to the heart's core of him, who, after years of wandering in a foreign clime, returns to find the father, whom he left still in the prime of vigorous and active manhood, howed, hent, grey-haired, and paralytie; the mother, whom he saw at their last parting, glorious in summer beauty, withered, and wrinkled, and bereft of every trace of former comeliness All this it does—at times to all! to the reflective always!—the solitary contemplation of the decaying year. Yet it was not this alone, it was not this at all, that blanched the cheek and dimmed the glance of Marian, as at a very early hour of the morning she was sauntering alone, with downcast eyes and slow uncertain gait, beside the margin of the stream, in the sheltered garden. For she did not, in truth, seem to contemplate at 2 all the face of external nature, or so much as to note the changes which had taken place during her absence; yet were those changes very great, and nowhere probably so strongly marked as in the very spot where she was wandering, for when she stood there last to cull a nosegay, ere she parted, the whole of that fair nook was glowing with the brightest colors, and redolent with the most fragrant perfumes, while hundreds of feathered songsters were filling every brake and thicket with bursts of joyous melody—and now only a few, the hardiest of the late autumnal flowers, displayed their scattered blossoms, and those too crisp and faded, among sere leaves and withered branches; while, for the mellow warblings of the thrush and black-bird, nothing was heard except the feeble piping of a solitary robin, mixed with the wailing rush of the swollen streamlet. For nearly an hour she walked to and fro buried in deep and melancholy silence, and thinking, as it seemed from her air and gestures, most profoundly—occasionally she paused for a few seconds in her walk to and fro, and stood still, gazing abstractedly on some spot in the withered herbage, on some pool of the bronkler, with her mind evidently far away, and once or twice she clasped her hands, and wrung them passionately, and sighed very deeply. While she was yielding thus to some deep inward sorrow—for it could be no trivial passing grief that had so suddenly and so completely changed so quick and gay a spirit—a gentle footstep sounded upon the gravel walk, behind a cluster of thick leafy lilacs, and in a moment Annabel stepped from their screen upon the mossy greensward. Her pale and pensive features were even paler and more thoughtful than was common, and her eyes showed as if she had been weeping, yet her step was as light and elastic as a young fawn's, and a bright smile dimpled her cheek, as she addressed her sister. “Dear Marian, why so early? And why did you not call me to share your morning walk? What ails you, dearest, tell me? For I have seen you, from my window, walking here up and down so sorrowful and sad—” “Oh, can you ask me—can you ask me, Annabel?” exclaimed the lovely girl, in a wild earnest burst of passion—“can you not see that my heart is breaking?” and with the words she flung her arms about her sister's neck, and burying her face in her bosom fell into an agony of tears. Annabel clasped Marian to her heart, and held her there for many moments, kissing away the big drops from her cheeks, and soothing her with many a kind and soft caress, before she replied to her incoherent and wild words—but when her violent sobbing had subsided, “Dearest,” she said, “I do not understand at all, nor can I even guess, what has so grievously afflicted you—but, if you fancy that we shall be parted, that our lives will hereafter be divided, and weep for that fond fancy, it is but a false apprehension that distresses you. I go not heuce at all, dear sister, until these fearful wars he over; and, then, I go not till the course of time shall place De Vaux in his good father's station, which—I pray Heaven—shall not fall out for years. And when I do go—when I do go away from this dear happy spot, you cannot, no, you did not dream, my sister, that you should not go with me. Oh, if you did dream that, it would be very hard for me to pardon you.” “Oh, no—no! no! dear Annabel,” replied the other, not lifting up her eyes from the fond bosom on which she hung so heavily, and speaking in a thick husky voice, “it is not that at all—but I am so unhappy—so miserable—so despairing! Oh, would to God—oh, would to God! that I had never gone hence—or that Ernest De Vaux, at least, had not come hither!” “Nay! now, I must know what you mean,” Annable answered mildly, but at the same time very firmly—“I must, indeed, dear Marian—for either such words have a meaning, in which case it is absolutely right that I your sister and his affianced wife should know it—or if they have not any, are cruel equally, and foolish. So tell me—tell me, dear one, if there be aught that I should know; and, in all cases, let me share your sorrow.” “Oh! do not—do not ask me, Annabel; oh! oh! to think that we two, who have been so happy, should be wretched now.” “I know not what you would say, Marian; but your strange words awake strange thoughts within me! We have indeed, been happy! fond, happy, innocent, dear sisters—and I can see no cause why we should now be otherwise—I, at least, am still happy, Marian, unless it be to witness your wild sorrow; and, if I know myself, no earthly sorrow would ever make me wretched, much less repining, or despairing.” “Yes, you—yes, you indeed may yet be happy, blessed with a cheerful home, a noble gallant husband, and it may be, one day, sweet prattlers at your knee, but, I— oh! God!” and she again burst into a fierce agony of tears and sobbing. Her sister, for a time, strove to console her, but she soon found not only that her efforts were in vain, but that, so far as she could judge, Marian's tears only flowed the faster, her sobs became more suffocating, the more she would have soothed them. When she became aware of this, then she withdrew gradually her arms from her waist, and spoke to her in a calm melancholy voice, full at the same time of deep sadness, and firm decided resolution. “Marian,” she said, “I see, and how I am grieved to see it, no words can possibly express, that you look not to me for sympathy or consolation—nay more, that you shrink back from my earesses, as if they were insincere or hateful to you. Your words, too, are so wild and whirling, that for my life. I cannot guess what is their meaning, or their cause—I only can suspect, or, I should rather say, can only dread, that you have suffered some very grievous wrong, or done some very grievous sin; and as I must believe the last impossible, my fears still centre on the first dark apprehension. Could you confide in me, I might advise, might aid, and could at least, most certainly, console you! Why you cannot, or will not trust me, you can know only. Side by side have we grown up, since we were little tottering things, guiding our weak steps hand in hand in mutual dependence, seldom apart, I might say never—for now, since you have been away, I have thought of you half the day, and dreamed of you all night—my earhest comrade, my best friend, my own, my only sister! And now we are two grown up maidens, with no one exactly fit to couusel or console us, except ourselves alone—since it has pleased our Heavenly Father, in his wisdom, for so long to deprive us of our dear mother's guidance. We are two lone girls, Marian, and never yet, so far as I know or can recollect, have we had aught to be ashamed of, or any secret one should not have communicated to the other. And now there is not one thought in my mind, one feeling or affection in my heart, which I would hide from you, my sister. What then can be this heavy sin, or sorrow, which you are now ashamed, or fearful, to relate to one, who surely loves you, as no one else can do, beneath the canopy of Heaven' Marian, you must reply to me in full, or I must leave you till better thoughts shall be awakened in your soul, and till you judge more truly of those who most esteem you.” “Too true! it is too true!” Marian re plied—“no one has ever loved me as you have done, sweet Annabel—and now, no one will love me any more—no one—no one, for ever. But you are wrong, quite wrong, when you suppose that any one has injured me, or that as yet I have done any wrong; alas! alas! that I should even have thought sin! Oh! no—Annabel, dear Annabel, I will bear all my woes myself —and God will give me grace to conquer all temptations. Pardon me, sister dear, pardou me; for it is not that I am ashamed, or that I fear to tell you—but that to save my own life, I would not plant one thorn in your calm bosom. No! I will see you happy; and will resist the evil one, that he shall flee from me; and God will give me strength, and you will pray for me, and we shall all be blessed.” As she spoke thus, the wildness and the strangeness of her manner passed away, and a calm smile flickered across her features, and she looked her sister steadfastly in the eye, and cast her arms about her neck, and kissed her tenderly as she finished speaking. But it was plain to see that Annabel was by no meaus satisfied; whether it was that she was anxious merely, and uneasy about the discomposure of her sister's mind; or whether something of suspicion had disturbed the even tenor of her own, appeared not; her color came and went, more quickly than was usual to her, and the glance of her gentle blue eye dwelt with a doubting and irresolute expression on Marian's face, as she made answer: “Very glad am I that, as you tell me, Marian, you have not suffered aught, or done anght evil—and I trust that you tell me truly. Beyond this, I cannot—I cannot, I confess it, sympathize with you at all; for in order to sympathize, one must understand, and that, you know, I do not. What sin you should have thought of, I cannot so much as conceive—but as you say you have resisted your temptations hitherto—but, oh, what possible temptations to aught evil, can have beset you in this dear peaceful home? I cannot not that you will be strengthened to resist them further. You tell me, Marian, that you would not plant a thorn in my calm bosom—it is true that my bosom was calm yester-morn, and very happy—but now I should speak falsely, were I to say that it is so. What thorn you would plant in my heart, I know not, by speaking openly—nor how you could suppose it—but this I do know, Marian, that you have set distrust, and dark suspicion and deep sorrow in my soul this morning. Distrust of yourself, dear Marian—for what can these half confidences breed except distrust? suspicion, of I know not—wish not to know—dare not to fancy what—deep sorrow that, already, even from one short separation, a great gulf is spread out between us. I will not press you now to tell me any more; but this I must impress upon you, that you have laid a burden upon me, which, save you only, no earthly being can remove; which nothing can alleviate except its prompt removal. Nay! Marian, nay! answer me nothing now—nothing in this strong heat of passionate emotion! think of it at your calmer leisure, and, if you can, in duty to yourself and others, give me your ample confidence. I pray you, Marian, do so. In the meantime go to your chamber, dearest—and wipe away these traces of your tears, and re-arrange your hair. Our guests will be assembled before this, and I have promised Ernest that we will all ride out, and see his falcons fly, this beautiful morning.” Marian made no reply at all, but following her sister into the house, hurried up to her chamber, to re-adjust her garments, and remove from her face the signs of her late disorder. Meanwhile, sad and suspicious, of she knew not what, and only by a violent effort concealing her heart-felt anxiety, Annabel joined her guests in the pleasant summer parlor. All were assembled when she entered, and all the preparations for the morning meal duly arranged upon the hospitable board —the morning meal, how widely different from that of modern days, how characteristic of those strong stirring times, when every gentleman was from his boyhood half a soldier, when every lady was prepared for deeds of heroism. There were no luxuries, effeminate and childish, of tea and chocolate, or coffee, although the latter articles were just beginning to be known; no dry toast or hot muffins; nor aught else of those things, which we now consider the indispensables of the first meal —but silver flagons mantling with mighty ale, and flasks of Bordeaux wine, and of rich canary, crowned the rich board, which groaned beneath sirloins of beef, and hams, heads of the wild boar, and venison pasties, and many kinds of game and wild fowl. Ernest De Vaux arose, as Annabel came in, from the seat which he had occupied by the good vicar's lady, whom he had been regaling with a thousand anecdotes of the court, and as many gay descriptions of the last modes, till she had quite made up her mind that he was absolute perfection, and hastened forward to offer her his morning salutation, but there was something of embarrassment in his demeanor, something of coldness in her manner, which was perceived for a moment by all her relatives and friends; but it passed away, as it were, in a moment; for, by an effort, he recovered almost instautly his self-possession, and began talking with light, careless pleasantry, that raised a smile upon the lips of all who heard him, and had the effect immediately of chasing the cloud from the brow of Annabel, who, after a few minutes, as if she had done injustice to her lover in her heart, and was desirous of effacing its remembrance both from herself and him, gave free rein to her feelings, and was the same sweet, joyous creature that she had been, since his arrival had awakened new sensations and new dreams in her young, guileless heart. Then, before half an hour had elapsed, more beautiful, perhaps, than ever, Marian made her appearance. Her rich profusion of brown curls clustered on her cheeks, and flowed down her neck from beneath a slashed Spanish hat of velvet, with a long ostrich feather, and her unrivalled figure was set off to more than usual advantage, by the long waist and flowing draperies of her green velvet riding dress. Her face was, perhaps, somewhat paler than its ordinary hue, when she first entered, but as she met the eye of Ernest, brow, cheeks, and neck, were crimsoned with a burning flush, which passed away, however, instantly, leaving her not the least embarrassed or confused, but perfectly collected, and as it seemed, full of a quiet, innocent mirthfulness. Nothing could be more perfect than was her manner, during the long protracted meal, towards her sister's lover. She seemed to feel towards him, already, as if he were a tried friend and brother. Her air was perfectly familiar, as she addressed him, yet free from the least touch of forwardness, the slightest levity or coquettishness. She met his admiring gaze— for he did, at times, gaze on her with visible admiration—yet admiration of so quiet and unpassionate a kind, as a good brother might bestow upon a sister's beauty—with calm unconsciousness, or with a girlish mirth, that defied misconstruction. And Annabel looked on—alas for Annabel!—and felt her doubts and suspicions vanishing away every moment. The vague distrust that had crept into her heart, melted away like mist wreaths from before the sun-beam. She only wondered now, what the anxiety, what the distrust could possibly have been, which, for a moment, had half maddened her. Then she began to marvel, what could the sorrow be which, scarce an hour before, had weighed so heavily on Marian; and which had in that brief space so utterly departed. “It must be,” she thought, as she gazed on her pure, speaking features, and the clear sparkle of her bright blue eye, “that she too loves, loves possibly in vain; that she has lost her young heart during her absence from her home; and has now overmastered her despair, her soul-consuming anguish, to sympathize in her sister's happiness;” and then she fancied how she would win from her that secret sorrow, and soothe it till she should forget the faithless one, and tend her with a mother's fond anxiety. Alas! alas! for Annabel! CHAPTER VII. The morning meal was ended; the sun already high in the clear heavens, and the thin mist wreaths were dispersing from the broad valley, and the bright river; and now a merry cavalcade swept round the lawn from the stables, a dozen foresters and grooms, well mounted, with led horses, two of the latter decked with velvet side saddles, which were then used by ladies, and seven or eight serving men, on foot, with hounds and spauiels in their leashes, and among them, conspicnous above the rest, the falconer, with his attendants, one bearing a large frame whereon were cast—such was the technical jargon used in the mystery of trainers— eight or ten long-winged falcons, goshawks, and gerfalcons, and peregrines, with all their gay paraphernalia of hoods, and bells, and jesses. A little while afterwards the fair girls came ont, Annabel now attired like her sister in the velvet riding robe, and the slashed, graceful hat, and were assisted to their saddles by the young lover. Then he, too, bounded to his noble charger's back and the others of the company in their turn mounted, and the whole party rode off, merrily, to the green meadows by the fair river's side. Away! away! the spaniels are uncoupled, and questing far and wide among the long green flags, and water briony, and mallows, that fringe the banks of many a creek and inlet of the river— over the russet stubbles—up the thick alder coppices, that fringe the steep ravines. Away! away! the smooth soft turf, the slight and brushy hedges, invite the free and easy gallop, invite the fearless leap! Away! with hawk unhooded on the wrist and ready—with graceful seat, light hand, and bounding heart! See how the busy spaniels snuff the hot scent, and ply their feathery tails among the dry fern on the bank of that old sunny ditch; there has the game been lately—hold hard, bold cavaliers—hold hard, my gentle ladies! —hurry not now the dogs. Hush! hark! the black King Charles is whimpering already: that beautiful-long-eared and silk water spaniel joins in the subdued chorus—how they thread in and out the withering fernstalks, how they rush through the crackling bramples! Yaff! yaff!—now they give tongue aloud—yaff! yaff! yaff! yaff! —and whir-r-r upsprings the well grown covey—now give your hearts to the loud whoop!—now fling your hawks aloft!— now gather well your bridles in your hands, now spur your gallant horses—on! on! sweep over the low fence, skim the green meadow, dash at the rapid brook— ladies and cavaliers pell-mell—all riding for themselves and careless of the rest, forgetful of all fear, all thought, in the fierce, fast career, as with eyes all turned heaven-ward to mark the soaring contest of the birds, trusting their goods steeds only, to bear them swift and safely, they drive in giddy routes down the broad valley. And now the flight is over—each gallant hawk has struck his cowering quarry —the lures are shaken in the air, the falconer's whoop and whistle recalls the hovering falcon, and on they go at slower pace to beat for frésh game—and lo! flip-flap, there rises the first woodcock of the season. “Ho! mark him—mark him down, good forester—we must not miss that fellow— the very prince of game—the king he would be, save that grey heronshaw of right has old claim to the throne of falconrie!” “Lo! there, my masters, he is down— down in that gulley's bank, where the broom and the branchens feather the sunny slope, and the long, rank grasses, that seen almost to choke its mossy runuel.” “Quick! quick! unhood the lanner— the young and speckled-breasted lanner! —cast off the old grey-headed gerfalcon— soh, Diamond, my brave bird! mark his quick, glancing eye, and his proud crest, soh? cast him off, and he will wheel around our heads, nor leave us till we flush the woodcock. No! no! hold the young lanner hard, let him not fly, he is too mettlesome and proud of wing to trust to—and couple all the dogs up, except the staunch red setter.” “Now we will steal on him up wind, and give him very chance.” “Best cross the gully here, fair dames, for it is something deep and boggy, and if ye were to brave it, in the fury of the gallop, you might be mired for your pains.” “That bird will show you sport; be sure of it, for lo! the field beyond is thickly set with stunted thorns, and tufts of alder bushes; if your hawks be not keen of sight, and quick of wing, too, be sure that he will dodge them; and if he reach you hill-side only, all covered as it is with evergreens, dense holly brakes, and thick oak saplings, he is as safe there in that covert, as though he were a thousand leagues away in some deep glen of the wild Atlas Mountains.” “Lo! there he goes, the grey hawk after him—by heaven! in fair speed he outstrips the gerfalcon, he does not condescend to dodge or double, but flies wild and high towards the purple moorland, and there we cannot follow him.” “Ride, De Vaux, gallop for your life— cut in, cut in between the bird and the near ridge—soh! bravely done black charger—now cast the lanner loose! so! that will turn him.” “See! he has turned; and now he must work for it—the angle he has made has brought old Diamond up against me weather wing—now! he will strike—now! now!” But lo! the wary bird has dodged, and the hawk who had soared, and was in the act of pouncing, checked his fleet pinion and turned after him—how swift he flies dead in the wind's eye—and the wind is rising; he cannot face it now—tack and tack, how he twists—how cleverly he beats to wind ward; but now the odds are terribly against him, the cunning falcons have divided, and are now flying sharply to cut him off, one at each termination of his tacks—the lanner has outstripped him. “Whoop! Robin, whoop!—soh! call him up to the wind—up to the wind, falconer, or he will miss his stroke. There! there he tower—up! up! in airy circles —he poises his broad wing—he swoops— alack, poor woodcock! but no! he has— by Pan, the god of hunters!—he has missed his cast—no swallow ever winged it swifter than the wild bird of passage—not now does he fly high among the clouds, but skims the very surface of the lawn, twisting round every tree and baffing the keen falcons.” Now he is scarce ten paces from his covert; the old bird, Diamond, flying like lightning, struggles in vain to weather him—in vain—the game dashes behind the boll of a tall upright oak, darts down among the hollies and is lost—well flown brave quarry—well flown noble—ha! the hawk—the brave old hawk, bent only on retrieving his lost flight, his eye set too steadily on the bird which he so fiercely struggled to outfly, has dashed with the full impetus of his arrowy flight against the gnarled stem of the oak; he rebounds from it like a ball from the iron target— never so much as once flaps his fleet pinions; tears not the ground with beak or claw. Diamond, brave Diamond is dead —and pitying eyes look down on him; and gentle tears are shed; and the soft hands that were wont to fondle his high crest and smoothe his ruffled wings, compose his shattered pinions, and sleek his blood-stained plumage—alas, brave Diamond!—but fate—it is the fate of war! Another flight—another glowing gallop to make the blood dance blithely in our veins—to drive dull care from our hearts! But no, the sylvan meal is spread— down by that leafy nook, under the still green canopy of that gigantic oak, where the pure spring wells out so clear and limpid, from the bright yellow gravel under its gnarled and tortnous roots—there is the snow-white linen spread on the mossy green sward; there the cold pasty and the larded capon tempt the keen appetite of the jolly sportsman; there, plunged in the glassy waters, the tall flasks of champagne are cooling! Who knows not the delicious zest with which we banquet on the green sward; the merry joyous ease which, all restraint and ceremonial banished, renders the sylvan meal, in the cool shadow by the rippling brook, so indescribably delightful? And all who were collected there were for the moment happy!—and many, in sad after days, remembered that gay feast, and dwelt upon the young hopes, which were so flattering then, hopes which so soon decayed—and lingered on the contemplation of that soon perished bliss, as if the great Italian had erred, when he declared so wisely that to the sons of man “Nessum maggior dolore Che ricordarsi del tiempo felice Nella miseria.” The bright wine sparkled in the gohlet, but brighter flashed the azure eyes of Marian, for her whole face was radiant with wild starry beauty. Was it the thrilling rapture of the gallop, that sent her blood boiling with strange excitement “through every petty artery of her body—” was it the spirit stirring chase alone, or did the rich blood of the Gallic grape, sparingly tasted though it was, lend something of unnatural power? hark to the silvery tones of that sweet ringing laugh —and now how deep a blush mantles her brow, her neck, her bosom, when in receiving her glass from the hand of Ernest, their fingers mingled for a moment But Ernest is unmoved, and calm, and seemingly unconscious—and Annabel, fond Annabel, rejoices to mark her sister's spirits so happily, so fully, as it seems, recovered from that over-mastering sorrow. She saw not the hot blush, she noted not its cause—and yet, can it be—can it be that casual pressure was the cause?—can it be love?—love for a sister's bridegroom, that kindles so the eye—that flushes so the cheek—that thrills so the life-blood of lovely Marian? Away! away with contemplation. Ernest reflects not, for his brow is smooth and all unruffled by a thought, his lips are smiling, his pulse calm and temperate—and Marian pauses not—and Annabel suspects not—Hush! they are singing. Lo! how the sweet and flute-like tones of the fair girls are blended with the rich and deep contralto of De Vaux. Lo! they are singing—singing the wood notes wild of the great master of the soul— “Heigho! sing heigho! under the green holly! Most friendship is feigning, Most loving mere folly!” Alas! for trusting Annabel!—soon shall she wake from her fond dream, soon wake to woe, to anguish. Again they mount their steeds, again they sweep the meadows, down to the very brink of the broad deep transparent Wharfe—and now the heronshaw is sprung—he flaps his dark grey vans, the hermit bird of the waters, and slowly soars away, till the falconer's shrill whoop, and the sharp whistling flutter of the fleet pinions in his rear arouse him to his danger—up! up! he soars—up! up! scaling to the very sky in small but swift gyrations—while side by side the well matched falcons wheel circling around him still, and still out-topping him, till all the three are lost in the grey fleecy clouds—the clouds!—no one had seen— no one has even dreamed, engrossed in the wild fervor of the sport, that all the sky was overclouded; and the thick blackness of the thunderstorm, driving up wind, and settling down in terrible proximity to the earth, was upon them unseen and unexpected. Away! away! what heed they, the dark storm-clouds—the increasing flash?—these bold equestrians! Heavens! what a flash —how keen! how close! how livid! the whole horizon shone out for a moment's space one broad blue glare of fearful living light—and simultaneously the thunder burst above them—a crash as of ten thousand pieces of earth's heaviest ordnance, shot off in one wild clatter. The horses of the party were all careering at their speed, their maddest speed, across a broad green pasture, bordered on the right hand by the wide channel of the Wharfe, and on the left by an impracticable fence of tall old thorns, with a deep ditch on either side, and a stout timber railing. The two fair sisters were in front, leading the joyous cavalcade, with their eyes in the clouds, their hearts full of the fire of the chase, when that broad dazzling glare burst full in their faces. Terrified by the livid flash and the appalling crash of the reverberated thunder, the horses of the sisters bolted diverse— Annabel's towards the broad rapid Wharfe, between which and the meadow through which they had been so joyously careering, there was no fence or barriers at the spot where they were then riding—Marian's towards the dangerous oxfence, which has been mentioned! The charger of De Vaux, who rode next behind them, started indeed, and whirled about, but was almost immediately controlled by the strong arm and skilful horsemanship of his bold rider; but of the grooms who followed, several were instantly dismounted, and there were only three or four who, mastering their terrified and fractious beasts, galloped off to the aid of their young mistresses. They were both good equestrians, and ordinarily fearless, but in such peril what woman could preserve her wonted intrepidity unshaken—the sky as black as night, with ever and anon a sharp clear stream of the electric fluid dividing the dark storm clouds, and the continuous thunder rolling and crashing overhead—their horses mad with terror, and endowed by that very madness with tenfold speed and strength!—Annabel, whose clear head, and calm, though resolute temper, gave her no small advantage over her volatile impetuous sister, sat, it is true, as firmly in her saddle, as though she had been practising her menage in the riding school—and held her fiery jennet with a firm steady hand; but naturally her strength was insufficient to control its fierce and headlong speed; so that she saw upon the instant, that she must be carried into the whirling waters of the swift river—for a moment she thought of casting herself to the ground, but it scarcely required one moment of reflection to show her that such a course could lead but to destruction. So on she drove, erect and steady in her seat, guiding her horse well, and keeping its head straight to the river bank, and hoping every instant to hear the tramp of De Vaux's charger overtaking her, and bringing succor— alas! for Annabel!—the first sound that distinctly met her ears was a wild piercing shriek—“Ernest—great God! my Ernest—help me!—save me!” It was the voice of Marian, the voice of her own cherished sister, calling on her betrothed —and he? Even in that dread peril, when life was on a cast, her woman heart prevailed above her woman fear, she turned, and saw the steed of Marian rushing with the bit between his teeth towards the dangerous fence, which lay, however, far more distant than the river to which her own horse was in terrible proximity! and he, her promised husband, the lord of her soul, he for whom she would have perished—oh, how willingly!—perished with but the one regret of that reparation—he had overlooked entirely, or heeded not at least, her peril to whom his faith was sworn; and even before that wild appealing cry, had started in pursuit—and was, as she looked round, in the act of whirling Marian from her saddle with one hand, while with the other he controlled his own strong war horse. When she first heard that cry, her spirit sank within her—but when she saw herself deserted, when the drear consciousness that she was not beloved, broke on her, it seemed as if an icebolt had pierced her heart of hearts! her eyes grew dim! there was a sound of rushing waters in her ear! not the sound of the rushing river, although her horse was straining now up the last ascent that banked it! her pulse stood still! Had Annabel then died, the bitterness of death was over. Before, however, she had so much as wavered in her saddle, much less lost rein or stirrup, a wild plunge, and the shock which ran through every nerve, as her horse leaped into the brimful river, awoke her for the moment to her present situation—unconsciously she had retained her seat—her horse was swimming boldly—a loud plunge sounded from be hind! another, and another! and the next instant her steed's head was seized by the stalwart arm of a young falconer, and turned towards the shore she had just quitted; her brain reeled round, and she again was senseless—thus was she borne to land, without the aid or intervention of him, who should have been the first to venture all, to lose all, for her safety. Alas! alas! for Annabel! CHAPTER VIII. When next she opened her eyes, she lay on her own bed, in her own well-known chamber, and the old nurse with the good vicar's wife, was watching over her. As her lids rose and she looked about her, all her intelligence returned upon the moment; and she was perfectly aware of all that had already passed, of all that she had still to undergo. “Well,” she replied, to the eager and repeated inquiries after the state of her bodily and mental sensations, which were poured out from the lips of her assiduous watchers—“Oh! I feel quite well, I do assure you—I was not hurt at all—not in the least—only I was so foolish as to faint from terror. But Marian, how is Marian?” “Not injured in the least—but very anxious about you, sweet Annabel,” replied mistress Summers, “so much so, that I was obliged to force her from the chamber, so terrible was her grief—so violent her terror and excitement. Lord De Vaux snatched her from her horse, and saved her before he even saw your danger; he, too, is in a fearful state of mind; he has been at the door twenty times, I believe, within the hour; hark, that is his foot now, will you see him, dearest?” A quick and chilly shudder ran through the whole frame of the lovely girl, and a faint hue glowed once again in her pale cheek; but mastering her feelings, she made answer in her own notes of sweet calm music. “Not yet, dear mistress Summers, not yet; but tell him, I beseech you, that I am better—well, indeed! and will receive his visit by and by; and in the meantime, my good friend, I must see Marian—must see her directly, and alone. No! no! you must not hinder me of my desire, you know,” she went on, with a faint and very melancholy smile, “you know of old, I am a wilful stubborn girl when I make up my mind, and it is quite made up now, my good friend! so, I pray you let me see her, I am quite strong, I do assure you, so do, I beseech you, go and console my Lord De Vaux, and let nurse bring me Marian hither.” So firmly did she speak, and so resolved was the expression of her soft gentle features, that they no longer hesitated to comply with her request; and both retired with soft steps from the chamber. Then Annabel half uprose from the pillows, which had propped her, and clasped her hands in attitude of prayer, and turned her beautiful eyes upward—her lips moved visibly, not in irregular impulsive starts, but with a smooth and ordered motion, as she prayed fervently, indeed, but tranquilly, for strength to do, and patience to endure, and grace to do, and to endure, alike with Christian love and Christian fortitude. While she was thus engaged, a quick uncertain footstep, now light and almost tripping, now heavy and half faltering, approached the threshold; a gentle hand raised the latch once, and again let it fall, as if the comer was fluctuating between the wish to enter, and some vague apprehension which for the moment conquered the desire. “Is it you, Marian?” asked the lovely sufferer, “oh come in, come in, sister!” and she did come in, that bright lovely sufferer, her naturally high complexion almost unnaturally brilliant now, from the intensity of her hot blushes: her eyes were downcast, and she could not so much as look up into the sad sweet face of Annabel. Her whole frame trembled visibly, as she approached the bed, and her foot faltered very much, yet she drew near, and sitting down beside the pillow, took Annabel's hand tenderly between her own, and raised it to her warm lips, and kissed it eagerly and often. Never, for a moment's space, did the eyes of Annabel swerve from her sister's features, from the moment she entered the door until she sat down by her side; but rested on them, as if through them they would peruse the secret soul with a soft, gentle scrutiny, that savored not at all of sternness or reproach. At last, as if she was fully satisfied, she dropped her eyelids, and for a little space, kept them close shut; while again her lips moved silently, and then pressing her sister's hand fondly, she said in a quiet soothing voice, as if she were alluding to an admitted fact rather than asking a question, “So you have met him before, Marian?” A violent convulsion shook every limb of her whom she addressed, and the blood rushed in torrents to her brow; she bowed her head upon her sister's hand, and burst into a paroxysm of hysterical tears and sobbing, but answered not a word. “Nay! nay! dear sister,” exclaimed Annabel, bending down over her, and kissing her neck, which, like her brow and cheeks, was absolutely crimson, “Nay! nay! sweet Marian, weep not thus, I beseech you, there is no wrong done—none at all—there was no wrong in your seeing him, when you did so—it was at York, I must believe—nor in your loving him either, when you did so; for I had not then seen him, and of course could not love him. But it was not right, sweetest Marian, to let me be in ignorance of all this; only think, dearest, only think what would have been my agony, when I had come to know, after I was a wife, that in myself becoming happy, I had brought misery on my second self, my own sweet sister! nay, do not answer me yet, Marian; for I can understand it all, that—almost all, that is—and I quite appreciate your motives, I am sure that you did not know that he loved you, for he does love you, Marian!— but fancied that he loved me only, and so resolved to control yourself, and crush down your young affections, and sacrifice yourself for me; thank God! oh! thank God, that your strength was not equal to the task, for had it been so, we had been wretched, oh! most wretched. But you must tell me all about it; for there is much I cannot comprehend—when did you see him first, and where?—why did he never so much as hint to me, that he had known you?—why, when I wrote you word that he was here, and afterward, that I liked, loved, was about to marry him—why did you never write back that you knew him? and why, above all, when you came and found him here—here in your mother's house, why did you meet him as a stranger? I know it will be painful to you, dear one; but you must bear the pain; for it is necessary now, that there shall be no more mistakes. Be sure of one thing, dearest Marian, that I will never wed him; oh! not for worlds! I could not sleep one night, not one hour, in the thought that my bliss was your bane; but if he loves you as he ought, and as you love him, sister, for I can read your soul, he shall be yours at once; and I shall be more happy so—more happy ten-fold, than pillowing my head upon a heart which beats for another—but he must explain all this, for I much fear me, he has dealt very basely by us both—I fear me much he is a bold, base man!” “No! no!” cried Marian, eagerly raising her clear eyes to her sister's, full of ingenuous truth and zealous fire. “No! no! he is all good, and true, and noble! I, it is I only, who have for once been false and wicked; not altogether wicked, Annabel, perhaps more foolish than to blame, at least in my intentions; but you shall hear all; you shall hear all, Annabel, and then judge for yourself,” and then, still looking her sister quite steadily and truthfully in the face, she told her how at a ball in York, she had met the young nobleman, who had seemed pleased with her; had danced with her many times, and visited her, but never once named love, nor led her in the least to fancy he esteemed her, beyond a chance acquaintance, “but I loved him, oh! how I loved him, Annabel; almost from the first time I saw him, and I feared ever—ever and only—that by my bold, frank rashness, he might discover his power, and believe me forward and unmaidenly; weeks passed, and our intimacy ripened, and I became each hour more fondly, more devotedly, more madly— for it was madness all!—enamored of him. “He met me ever as a friend, no more! The time came, when he was to leave York, and as he took leave of me he told me that he had just received despatches from his father, directing him to visit mine; and I, shocked by the coolness of his parting tone, and seeing indeed he had no love for me, scarcely noting what he said, told him not that I had no father, but I did tell him that I had one sweet sister, and suddenly extorted from him, unawares, a promise that he would never tell you he had known me; my manner, I am sure, was strange and wild; and I have no doubt my words were so likewise, for his demeanor altered on the instant; his air, which had been that of quiet friendship, became cool, chilling, and almost disdainful, and within a few minutes he took his leave, and we never met again till yester even. “You will I doubt not, ask me wherefore I did all this! I was mad—mad with love and disappointment. And the very instant he said that he was coming hither, I knew as certainly that he would love you and you him, Annabel, as though it had been palpably revealed to me. I could not write of him to you—I could not, Annabel, and when your letters came, and we learned that he was here, I confessed all this to our aunt; and though she blamed me much, for wild and thoughtless folly, she thought it best to keep the matter secret. This is the whole truth, Annabel— the whole truth! I fancied that the absence—the knowledge that I should see him next my sister's husband—the stern resolve with which I bound my soul, had made me strong enough to bear his presence—I tried it, and I found myself, how weak—this is all, Annabel; can you forgive me, sister?” “Sweet, innocent Marian,” exclaimed the elder sister through her tears, for she had wept constantly through the whole sad narration, “there is not anything for me to forgive—you have wronged yourself only, my sister! But yet—but yet!—I cannot understand it—he must have seen—no man could fail to see that one, so frank and artless as you are, Marian, was in love with him—he must, if not before, have known it certainly, when you extorted from him, as you call it, that strange promise. Besides he loves you, Marian; he loves you— then wherefore, in God's name! did he woo me—for woo he did, and fervently, and long, before he won me to confession? oh! he is base!—base, base, and bad at heart, my sister!—answer me nothing, dear one, for I will prove him very shortly —send Margaret hither to array me. I will go down and speak with him forth with— if he be honest, Marian, he is yours—and think not that I sacrifice myself, when I say this, for all the love I ever felt for him has vanished utterly away—if he is honest, he is yours—but be not over confident, dear child, for I believe he is not—and if not, why then, sweet Marian can we not comfort one another, and live together as we used, dear, innocent, united, happy sisters? Do not reply now, Marian—your heart is too full—haste and do as I tell you; before supper time to-night, all shall be ended; whether for good or for evil. HE only knows, to whom the secrets of the heart are visible, even as the features of the face. Farewell, be of good cheer, and yet not over-cheerful.” CHAPTER IX. Within an hour after that most momentous conversation, Annabel sat beside the window, in that pleasant summer parlor, looking out on the fair prospect of mead and dale and river, with its back-ground of purple mountains; the very window from which she had first looked upon De Vaux! Perhaps a secret instinct had taught her to select that spot, now that she was about to renounce him for ever; but if it were so, it was one of those indefinable impulsive instincts of which we are unconscious, even while they prompt our actions. De Vaux was summoned to her presence, and Annabel awaited him—arbiter of her own and her sister's destinies! “Ernest,” she said, as he entered, cutting across his eager and impetuous inquiries, “Ernest De Vaux, I have learned to-day a secret”—she spoke with perfect ease, and without a symptom of irritation, or anxiety, or sorrow, either in her voice or manner; nor was she cold, or dignified, or haughty. Her demeanor was not, indeed, that of a fond maid towards her accepted suitor; nor had it the flutter which marks the consciousness of unacknowledged love; a sister's to a dear brother's would have resembled it more nearly than, perhaps, anything to which it could be compared, yet was not this altogether similar. He looked up in her face with a smile, and asked her at once, “What secret, dearest Annabel?” “A secret, Ernest,” she replied, “which I cannot but fancy you must have learned before, but which you certainly have learned, as well as I, to-day. My sister loves you, Ernest.” The young man's face was crimson on the instant, and he would have made some reply, but his voice failed him, and, after a moment of confused stuttering, he stood before her in embarrassed silence; but she went on at once, not noticing, apparently, his consternation. “If you did know this, as I fear must be the case, long, long ago! most basely have you acted, and most cruelly to both of us; for never! never! even if it had been a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable passion on her part, would I have wedded, knowingly, the man who held my sister's heart-strings!” “It was,” he answered, instantly, “it was a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable passion on her part, believe me, oh! believe me, Annabel! that is—that is,” he continued, reddening again at feeling himself self-convicted, “that is, if she felt any passion.” “Then you did know it—then you did know it,” she interrupted him, without paying any regard to his attempt at self-correction, “then you did know it from the very first—oh! man, man! oh! false heart of man—oh! false tongue that can speak thus of the woman whom he loves! yes, loves!” she added, in a clear, high voice, as thrilling as the alarm blast of a silver trumpet, “yes, loves, Ernest De Vaux, with his whole heart and spirit! Never think to deny it! did I not see you, when you rushed to save her from lesser peril, when you left me, as you must have thought, to perish—did I not see love written as clearly as words in a book, on every feature of your face, even as I heard love crying out aloud in every accent of her voice?” “What! jealous, Annabel? the calm and self-controlling Annabel! can she be jealous—of her own sister, too?” “Not jealous, sir,” she answered, now most contemptuously, “not jealous, in the least, I do assure you! For though, most surely, love can exist without one touch of jealousy, as surely cannot jealousy exist where there is neither love, nor admiration, nor esteem, nor so much as respect existing.” “How? do I hear you aright?” he asked somewhat sharply, “do I understand you aright? What have become, then, of your vows and protestations—your protestations of yester even?” “You do hear me—you do understand me,” she replied, “entirely right—entirely! In my heart—for I have searched it very deeply—in my heart there is not now one feeling of love, or admiration, or esteem, much less of respect for you; alas! that I should say so! alas! for me and you! alas! for one, more to be pitied twenty-fold than the other!” “Annabel Hawkwood, you have never loved me.” “Ernest De Vaux, you never have known —never will know—because you are incapable of knowing the depth, the singleness, the honesty of a true woman's love! So deeply did I love you, that I have come down hither, seeing that long before you knew me, you had won Marian's heart—seeing that you loved her, as she loves you most ardently—and hoping that you had not discovered her affection, nor suspected your own feelings until to-day, I came down hither, I say, with that knowledge, in that hope, and I had found that you had erred no further than in trivial fickleness, she loving you all the while beyond all things on earth, I purposed to resign your hand to her, thus making both of you happy, and trusting for my own consolation to consciousness of right and to the love of Him, who, all praise be to Him therefor, has so constituted the spirit of Annabel Hawkwood, that when she cannot honor, she cannot afterwards for ever feel either love or friendship You are weighed, Ernest De Vaux, weighed in the balance and found wanting! I leave you now, sir, to prepare my sister to bear the blow your baseness has inflicted. Our marriage is broken off at once, now and for ever! Lay all the blame on me—on me! if it so please you; but not one word against my own or my sister's honor! My aunt I shall inform instantly, that, for sufficient reasons, our promised union will not take place at all; the reasons I shall lock up in my own bosom. You may remain here—you must do so—this one night; to-morrow morning we will bid you adieu for ever!” “Be it so,” he replied. “Be it so, lady; the fickleness I can forgive, but not the scorn! I will go now, and order that the regiment march hence forthwith. What more recruits there he, can follow at their leisure, and I will overtake the troops before noon, on the march, to-morrow;” and with the words he left the room, apparently as unconcerned as if he had not left a breaking heart behind him, and as if all the agonies of hell had not been burning within his own. And was it true that Annabel no longer loved him? True! oh! believe it not! where woman once has fixed her soul's affections, there they will dwell for ever; principle may compel her to suppress them; prudence may force her to conceal them; the fiery sense of instantaneous wrong may seem to quench them for a moment; the bitterness of jealousy may turn them into gall; but, like that Turkish perfume, where love has once existed, it must exist for ever, so long as one fragment of the earthly vessel which contained it survives the wreck of time and ruin. She believed that she loved him not; but she knew not herself; what woman ever did? what man? when the spring-tide of passion was upon them? And she, too, left the parlor, and within a few minutes, Marian had heard her fate, and after many a tear, and many a passionate exclamation, she, too, apparently, was satisfied of Ernest's worthlessness; oh! misapplied and heartless term! She satisfied? satisfied by the knowledge that her heart's idol was an unclean thing, an evil spirit, a false god! she satisfied? oh! Heaven! Around the hospitable board once more —once more they were assembled; but oh! how sadly altered; the fiat had been distinctly, audibly pronounced; and all assembled there had heard it, though none, except the sisters and De Vaux, knew of the cause; none probably, but they, suspected it. Well was it that there were no young men—no brothers with high hearts and strong hands to maintain or question. Well was it, that the only relatives of those much-injured maidens, the only friends, were superannuated men of peace—the ministers of pardon, not of vengeance—and weak, old helpless women! There had been bloodshed else— and, as it was, among the serving men, there were dark brows, and writhing lips, and hands alert to grasp the hilt at a word spoken, had they but been of rank one grade higher—had they dared even as they were, there had been bloodshed! Cold, cold and cheerless was the conversation; formal and dignified civilities, in place of gay, familiar mirth; forced smiles for hearty laughter; pale looks and dim eyes, for the glad blushes of the promised bride—for the bright sparkles of her eye! The evening passed—the hour of parting came; and it was colder yet and sadder. Ernest De Vaux, calm and inscrutable, and seemingly unmoved, kissed the hands of his lovely hostesses, and uttered his adieu and thanks for all their kindness, and hopes for their prosperity and welfare; while the old clergymen looked on with dark and angry brows, and their help-mates with difficulty could refrain from loud and passionate invective. His lip had a curl upon it—a painful curl, half sneer, as he bowed to the rest, and left the parlor; but none observed that as he did so, he spoke three or four words, in a low whisper, so low that it reached Marian's ear alone, of all that stood around him, yet of such import, that her color came and went ten times within the minute, and that she shook from head to foot, and quivered like an aspen. For two hours longer, the sisters sat together in Annabel's bedchamber, and wept in one another's arms, and comforted each other's sorrows, and little dreamed that they should meet no more for years, perchance for ever. CHAPTER X. Three hours had elapsed since all the inhabitants of Ingleborough Hall had retired to their own chambers, and one, at least, since Marian had retired from her sister's dressing-room, to bed, but not to sleep. During that weary hour, she had lain tossing to and fro, feverish with anxiety and expectation, irresolute, anxious, and heartsick. The last words which Ernest De Vaux had whispered in her ear, unheard by any others, contained a fervent entreaty, perhaps—I should say, rather, a command— that she should meet him after all the house had gone to rest, in the garden. And strange it was, that despite all that had passed, despite all her own good resolutions, all the resistance of her native modesty, all her conviction— for she was almost convinced that he was base and bad—she yet lacked firmness to set the tempter at defiance. It is a singular fact, but one which we nevertheless encounter more frequently than would be supposed, that it is women of the most bold and free and fearless characters, who, so long as their fancies are untouched, appear the wildest and the most untamable, that are subdued and engrossed the most completely, when they once become thoroughly enamored, when they once meet with an overmastering spirit. And so it was with Marian Hawkwood; high spirited and almost daring, while her heart was free, no sooner had she fallen desperately in love, as she did, with De Vaux, than she became, so far as she was concerned, the most thoroughly subjugated and tamed of beings. Her whole nature, towards him at least, seemed to have undergone a change. Her very intellect appeared to have lost much of its brilliancy, of its rapid and clear perceptions, as soon as he was to be judged. To us, such things appear very strange, although we see them happening before our eyes almost daily. To us, they are as inexplicable as the one half of our motives and our actions must appear incomprehensible to the other sex. But all these diversities, all these inexplicable contradictions as they seem, in the nature and characteristics of our race, have been created, and unquestionably for wise ends, by Him whose every deed is all wise, whose every purpose perfect. And it may well be that it is these very differences, these very extremities of thought and action, that render the two sexes so eminently attractive to another. To the mind of a man it naturally would appear impossible, that after what had passed, Marian should still entertain a belief, a hope even, that De Vaux could explain honorably his most dishonorable conduct—dishonorable, if possible, yet more towards herself than towards Annabel. It would seem that when he presumed to whisper in her ear that prayer for a clandestine interview, she would have recognised and spurued him for the villain that he was. But it was not so— she still hoped—if she did not believe— and if she made him no answer at the time, it was that her maiden purity of soul revolted from the idea of a rendezvous with any man at that untimely hour, and in a place so sequestered. At first, indeed, she resolved that she would not meet him, and even made up her mind to confide his request to Annabel, as a fresh proof of his atrocious baseness. But gradually worse thoughts and more fatal wishes began to creep in, and she suffered the long conversation between herself and Annabel to come to a termination, without touching on the circumstance at all. At length she left her sister's chamber, and withdrew to her own, still without any fixed intention of granting his request, but certainly without any fixed determination not to do so. After she had undressed herself, however, and that she did so was a proof that up to this time her better principles had the upper hand, she knelt down by her bedside, buried her face in her hands, and seemed, at least, to pray. It was, however, but too evident that her mind was in no state for prayer. She burst into a fit of violent and convulsive weeping, mixed with sobs almost hysterical, while strong shudderings ran through her whole fair frame. “No!” she said, starting up after a while, and calming herself by a powerful effort of the will—“no, no, I cannot pray —it is mockery—a shameful mockery to bend my knees and move my lips in prayer before the throne of God, when no thought of him remains fixed in my mind —when by no effort can I concentrate my wandering senses upon his goodness and mercy—when by no effort can I banish from my soul the recollection, the wild yearning for the creature usurping thus the place of the Creator! Oh, my God!” she continued, even more wildly than before—“my God, what shall I do—what shall I do! what have I done that I should be thus terribly afflicted! To bed—to bed!” she added, extinguishing her taper, as she spoke—“to bed, but not to sleep! never to sleep again in peace or dreamless. Would to God that this bed were the grave—the cold unconscious grave!” And with the words, she laid her head upon the pillow, and closed her eyelids, saying to herself “no, no, it were unmaidenty, I will not think of it—no, no!” But she did think of it—nay, she could think of nothing else; and ere long she unclosed her eyes, and looked about her chamber with a wild, eager glance, as if she were in search of something which she expected to see there, but saw not. Again she closed them, and cast herself back impatiently upon the bed, and lay quiet for a little while; but it was only by a great effort that she forced herself to do so, and before long, she started up crying, “I shall go mad—I shall go mad—I hardly know if I am not mad already. It is all fire here!” and she elasped her small white hands over her brow, “all raging and consuming fire! Air! air! I must have air— I am choking, stifling! Can it be that the room is so suffocating hot—or is it in my own heart?” The comfortable, roomy chamber in which she lay, could not have been more pleasantly attempered to the weather and the season, had it been regulated by the thermometer. It was a large and airy chamber, situated at the corner of the house, so that its two large latticed casements looked out in different directions, one over the little garden amphitheatre so often noticed, the other down the broad valley to the southward. The moon, which now was nearly full, streamed in at the eastern window, and would have rendered the room nearly as bright as day, if it had not been for the leafy head of one of the huge sycamores that interrupted the soft beams partially; and swaying backward and forward in the west wind, which was fitful and uncertain, now blowing in long gusts, now lulling altogether, cast huge and wavering shadows over the floor and walls—so that they were at one time all bathed in lustrous light, and the next moment steeped in misty shadows. There was something in this wavering effect of light and shade, that at first caught the eye merely and attracted the physical attention, if it is allowed so to speak, and afterwards began to produce an impression on her mind. It seemed to her as if the vagueness and incertitude of these fleeting shades were in some sort assimilated to the wild and whirling thoughts which were chasing one another across the horizon of her own mind. Then she compared them to the changes and chances of mortal life, and thence, as we are all so prone to do, when in trouble and affliction, she began to charge all her own misfortunes, and many of her own faults, to the account of fortune. If it had not been for the irresistible destiny which had compelled Ernest to leave her at York, it could not have been, she thought, that seeking her out so eagerly as he did on all occasions, and admiring her personal charms so evidently, Ernest should not have ended by loving and wooing her instead of her passionless and gentle sister. And from this train of thought she fell into another yet more perilous. How, she now asked herself, had it come to pass that he had wooed Annabel at all— how, when he loved herself, should he have sought her sister's love—or how, loving her sister, should he have given way, so clearly and openly as he had done to-day, to a passion for herself. His conduct did seem in truth incomprehensible—perhaps to himself, even, it might have been so—for, I believe that, far oftener than is generally believed, men, if they were to subject themselves to strict self-examination, would be at a loss to account to themselves for the motives whence arise very many of their actions. This very strangeness of Ernest De Vaux's demeanor—this very impossibility of accounting for his conduct on any reasonable hypothesis, had the worst possible effect for her happiness, on the mind of Marian. If she was to consider this whole course of conduct infamous and base, the baseness seemed too gratuitous, the infamy too void of motive, to be credited. And hence she was led to fancy that there must be some unseen and secret hand which had given motion to the whole machinery, and which, could it but be discovered, would probably afford a ready clue and complete solution to all that now appeared dark and enigmatical in her lover's words and actions. For whatever we find glaringly inconsistent, or foolishly miscontrived in the conduct of men, we are wont in our blindness and conceitedness of heart to consider enigmatical and obscure, as if, forsooth, men were anything but masses of inconsistencies the most glaring and self-evident. Having soon brought herself to the conclusion that because she could not understand the conduct of Ernest, there must necessarily be something in it to be understood, she now went to work to find out what this something could be. The original bane of woman, curiosity, was busy in her secret soul, and soon there came together two sister friends to aid her in the invidious onslaught she was seeking on the strongholds of principle and virtue—fit partners in the foul alliance, vain self-esteem, and jealousy. First she commenced asking herself how it could have been that he should have failed to love her, and yet have fallen in love instantly with Annabel— then she half doubted whether he had, indeed, ever loved Annabel at all—that he did so no longer was quite evident— and in the end she convinced herself, that she had been the object of his love from the beginning, that by some misapprehension of her manner he had been led to believe her indifferent to himself, and that in pique he had devoted himself to her sister. This train once kindled in her mind, the flame ran rapidly from point to point, and she was very soon so completely self-deluded, that she gave herself up to the conviction that she was herself the only true love of De Vaux, that his conduct had been natural, and if very blamable, still honorable, and deserving some compassion from the fact that her own charms had been the cause of all the mischief. Still she was very far from having made up her mind to meet him, though she had already admitted to herself that it was cruel to condemn him without giving him an opportunity of defending himself, and one step leading to another, she soon began to consider seriously the possibility of doing that, which but an hour before she could not have contemplated without terror and disgust. Ere long it was fear only that dissuaded her from going—the fear of discovery, and that was but a weak opponent to strong and passionate love—for she did love Ernest De Vaux strongly and passionately —particularly when that love was, aided and abetted by the other kindred spirits of evil, which I have enumerated, and which for ever lie hid in the secret recesses of the human heart waiting the opportunity to arise and do battle, when the better principles are weakened by temptations, and the tone of the mind soured by vexation and rendered angry by disappointment. Then she arose at length, half timidly still, and half reluctantly. Nor did she as yet admit to herself what was her intention as she dressed herself hastily, and stole with a beating heart and noiseless step to the door of her sister's chamber. Opening it with a careful hand, she entered, and stole silently to the bedside. Pale as a lily, calm and tranquil lay sweet Annabel, buried in deep, and as she at first thought, dreamless sleep. One fair slight hand was pressed upon her bosom, the other arm was folded under the head of the lovely sleeper. The broad light of the moonbeams fell in a flood of pure silvery radiance over the lovely picture—and surely never lovelier was devised—of virgin innocence, and purity of meekness. For many moments the perturbed and anxious Marian stood by the side of the couch gazing upon the face of that once beloved sister—alas! that I must say once beloved—for already had jealousy, and distrust, and envy come over the heart of the no less lovely watcher—and she felt, as she stood there, that she no longer loved that sister, as she used to love, or as she was still herself beloved. No contrast can be imagined more striking than that between the sleeper, so still, so tranquil, so serene—yet so inanimately pale and spiritual in her aspect—and the flushed cheeks, and flashing eyes, and frame quivering with wild excitement of the half trembling, half guilty girl who stood beside her. The deep regular calm breathing of the sleeper, the short quick panting inspirations of the excited watcher—the absolute unconsciousness of the one and the terrible and overwrought feelings of the other—the innocence, the confidence, the trust in God, of Annabel— the agonies, the wishes, and the doubts of Marian. And strange as it may seem, the very peacefulness, the very absence of all semblance of earthly feeling or earthly passion in her slumbering sister, the infantile repose which brooded over the candid face, augmented Marian's feelings of nascent dislike or disaffection. An angry sense of vexation that Annabel should be able to sleep sound and quiet even amid her griefs, while she could neither rest in mind or body. Then she began to justify herself in her own eyes by suffering her mind to dwell on the idea that Annabel could not be wronged by her, should she consent to wed Ernest, for that her very calmness and tranquillity must needs betoken the absence of true passion. While she was wondering thus a slight sound from the garden under the windows caught her ear, and she started wildly, her heart bounding as if it would have burst out of her tortured bosom. A shadow steals not across the moonlighted landscape more noiselessly than did Marian Hawkwood glide over the carpet to the lattice, and gaze down into the quiet shrubbery. Alas! for Marian—there on the gravel walk, half hidden by the shadow of the giant sycamores, stood the graceful and courtly figure of the tempter. His eyes were directed upward to the casement at which she was standing— they met hers—and on the instant, deeply versed in all the hypocrisies of gallantry, Ernest De Vaux knelt down, and clasped his hands as if he were in prayer, and she might see his lips tremble in the moonlight. She turned—she retrod the chamber floor in silence—she stood again beside her sister's bed—but this time it was to see only whether that sister's eyes were sealed in oblivious slumber. As she paused, she had an opportunity of judging whether the dreams of that pale sleeper were indeed so blissful—whether the heart of Annabel was so serene and passionless. The moonbeams fell full on her face, as I have said, and Marian saw two heavy tears glide from her deeply curtained lids, and slide down her transparent cheeks; and while she gazed upon her she stirred, and stretched out both her arms, as if to clasp some one, and murmured in her sleep the name—of Marian. Had that small simple thing occurred before the girl looked out and saw Ernest, all might yet have been well—but it was all too late—passion was burning in her every vein, and bounding in her every pulse—it was too late!—she turned and left the chamber. Cautiously she stole to the staircase, groping her way in the glimmering twilight through the long oaken corridor—as she reached the stairhead she again paused, listened, and trembled—did she hesitate? Upon that landing-place there stood two complete panoplies of steel, worn by some loyal Hawkwood of old time in the wars of the Roses, and as the eyes of the excited girl fell upon them, it appeared to her that the spirits of her dead ancestors were looking out from the bars of their avantailles reproachfully on their delinquent daughter. Hastily she darted past them, and flew down the stairs and reached the vestibule, and there she met another interruption, for a small favorite greyhound— her favorite—she had reared it from a puppy when its dam perished—which was sleeping on the mat, rose up and fawned upon her, and would not be repulsed, but stood erect on its hinder legs and laid its long paws on her arm, as she thought afterward, imploringly, and uttered a low ominous whine as she cast it off. She unbolted the hall door, opened it, glided out like a guilty spectre into the glimpses of the moon—and as she did so a fleecy cloud passed over the pale face of the planet, and a long wailing cry rose plaintively upon the still night. It was but the cry of an owl—there were hundreds of them in the woods around, and she heard them hoot nightly—yet now she shuddered at the sound as if it were a warning—and was it not so? The smallest things are instruments in the hands of Him, to whom all earthly things are small. CHAPTER XI. Despite the warning sounds, which at the moment smote on her soul so ominously, Marian went down the steps leading from the little porch into the garden, although her steps faltered, and her heart beat violeutly between fear and expectation, and the consciousness that she was acting wrongly. Before she had advanced, however, ten paces, round the corner of the hall, into the grove of sycamores, wherein the shadows fell dark and heavy over the gravel walk which rhreaded it, she was joined by Ernest de Vaux. He appeared, at the moment, to be little less agitated than she was herself; his countenance, even to the lips, was ashy pale, and she could see that he trembled, and it was owing, perhaps, to this very visible embarrassment on his part, that Marian felt less forcibly the extreme impropriety, if not indelicacy, of her own conduct. Had he come to meet her, confident, proud, and evidently exhilarated by the success of his machinations, it is possible that her modesty would have been offended; that she would have discovered the danger she was running, and withdrawn, ere it was yet too late, for happiness or honor. But, as it was, when she saw the man she loved, coming to meet her, wan and agitated, timid, and with the trace of tears on his pallid cheeks, a sense of pity rose in her bosom, and lent its aid to the pleadings of that deceptive advocate within her soul, which needed no assistance in his favor. Still, as she met him, there was an air of dignity, and self-restraint, and maidenly reserve about her, that went some little way at least to screen her from the consequences of her exceeding indiscretion; and when she addressed him—for it was she who spoke the first—it was in a voice far cooler, and more resolute, than the mind which suggested and informed it. “I trust”—she said—“my Lord de Vaux, that you have good and sufficient cause for the strange request which you made me at our last interview—some cause, I mean, sir, that may justify you, in requiring a lady to meet you thus clandestinely, and alone, and her in consenting to do so. There has been so much strange and mysterious, my lord, in your whole conduct and demeanor, from the first to the last; and that mystery—if not deceit—has wrought effects so baleful on my sister's happiness, that I confess I have hoped you may have something to communicate that may, in some degree, palliate your own motives, which now seem so evil; and repair the positive evil which you have done her. It is on this consideration only, that I have consented to give you a hearing. It is in this trust only, that I have taken a step, which I fear me is unmaidenly and wrong in itself—but it is by my motives that my conduct must be judged; and I know those to be honorable and correct. Now, my lord, may it please you to speak quickly that you have got to say—but let me caution you, that I hear no addresses, nor receive any pleadings, meant for my own ear—one such word, and I leave you. Speak, my lord!” “You are considerate, ever, dear young lady”—replied Ernest de Vaux, in tones of deep respect, not drawing very near her, nor offering to take her hand, nor tendering any of those customary familiarities, which, though perfectly natural at any other time, might, under present circumstances, have had the effect of alarming her, and checking her freedom of demeanor. “You are considerate, ever, dear young lady! and I am bold to say it, your confidence is not misplaced, nor shall your trust be deceived!” “I do not know”—answered Marian— “I do not know, my lord! It is for you to show that—at present, appearances are much against you; nor do I see what explanation you can make, that shall exonerate you. But to the point, my lord, to the point!” “None, Miss Hawkwood—none! I have no explanations that I can make which shall exonerate—” “Then why”—she interrupted him, warmly and energetically—“why have you brought me hither?—or to what do you expect that I shall listen?—not, methinks! to a traitor's love-tale?” “Which shall exonerate me, I would have said”—De Vaux resumed, as quickly as she left off speaking—“had you permitted me, from the grossest and most blind folly—hallucination—madness!— Yes! I believe I have been mad.” “Madness, my lord,” exclaimed Marian, “is very apt to be the plea of some people for doing just whatsoever they think fit—without regard to principle or honor, to the feelings of their fellow-creatures, or to the good opinion of the world. I trust it is not so with you; but I, for one, have never seen aught in your conduct that was incompatible with the most sound and serious sanity.” “I hardly know how I may speak to you without offence, dear mistress Marian. My object, in requesting you to hear a few last words from a very wretched, and very penitent man, arose from a painful yearning to stand pardoned, if not justified, in the eyes of one being at least, of this family, to whom I owe so much, and by whom I am now so grievously misapprehended.” “Then I was right!” answered Marian, joyously, and her eye sparkled for a moment, and her pale cheek flushed crimson —“then you have some excuse to offer— well! my lord, well. It was in hopes of hearing such, that I came hither—there can be no offence to me in that—I shall be very glad to hear that one of whom I have thought well, is worthy of such estimation.” “But to prove that,” he answered, in a soft, low voice, “I must enter upon a history; I must speak to you of things that passed long ago—of things that passed at York!” “My lord!” and she started back, a brief spark of indignation gleaming in her bright eyes—“my lord!” “Nay,” he replied, humbly and sadly, “if you forbid me to speak, I am silent; but by no means can I exculpate myself, but by naming these things; and I asseverate to you by the earth, and the heavens, and all that they contain!—I swear to you, by Him who made them all! that, if you deign to hear me, I have a perfect and complete defence against all but the charge of folly. And, as you hope for happiness yourself, here or hereafter, I do conjure you hear me!” “Your promises are very strong, my lord; and your adjuration such, that I may not refuse to listen to you.” “I must speak to you of yourself, lady!” “Of myself?” “Aye! of yourself—for you, Marian Hawkwood, are the cause, the sole cause of everything that has appeared inconsistent, base, or guilty on my part!” “I! my lord—I!—I the cause of your inconsistency, your guilt, your baseness!” she cried, indignantly. “Prove it, prove it—but I defy you”—she added, more calmly, and with a scornful intonation of voice—“You know that all this is words —words—false and empty words! Now, sir, speak out at once, or I leave you— better it were, perhaps, had I never come at all!” Better, indeed! Alas! poor Marian, that your own words should be so terribly prophetic, that your one fault should have so sealed and stamped your life with the impression of remorse and sorrow. For 3 Ernest de Vaux had now gained his end, he had so stimulated and excited her curiosity, and through her curiosity, her interest, that she was now prepared, nay, eager, to listen to words, which, a little while before, she would have shrunk from hearing. And he perceived the advantage he had gained—for all his seeming agitation and embarrassment were but consummate acting, and made himself ready to profit by it to the utmost. “You cannot but remember, lady”—he resumed, artfully, adopting the unconcerned tone of a mere narrator—“the day when I first saw you at the High Sheriff's ball?” “I do not know, my lord, what very charming memories I have to fix the time or place, upon my mind, of an event by no means striking or delightful; was it at the High Sheriff's ball?—it might have been, doubtless; for I was there—and if you say it was, I do not doubt that you are quite right.” But this affected unconcern, this little stratagem of poor Marian, availed her nothing with De Vaux; for he saw through it in a moment. He knew instinctively and instantly, that it was affected—and more, the affectation convinced him that there was something that she would conceal; and what that something was, his consummate knowledge of the female heart informed him readily. But he replied, as if he was taken in by her artifice. “It is fortunate for you,” he said, “that you can forget so easily—would to God that I had been able to do likewise—but if you have forgotten the time and the place, I cannot believe that you have as speedily forgotten the deep and evident impression which your charms made upon me—my eagerness to gain your acquaintance—my constant and assiduous attentions—in short, the deep and ardent passion with which you had filled my very soul, from the first hour of our meeting.” “Indeed!” she replied, very scornfully, and coldly, “you do far too much honor to my penetration. I never once suspected anything of the kind; nor do I even now conjecture what motive can impel you to feign, what, I believe, never had an existence in reality.” “You must have been blind, indeed, lady, as blind as I was myself. And yet you cannot deny that my eye dwelt on you; followed you everywhere—that I danced with you constantly, with you alone, and that when I danced not with you, I waited ever nigh you, to catch one glance from your eye, one murmur from your sweet voice. You cannot but have noticed this!” “And if I did, my lord?—and if I did, ladies of birth and station do not imagine that every young man, who likes to dance with them, and talk soft nonsense to them, who perhaps thinks them pretty enough, or witty enough, to while away a tedious hour in the country, is in love with them, any more than they wish gentlemen to flatter themselves, that they have yielded up their hearts, because they condescend to be amused by lively conversation, or even flattered by attentions, which they receive as things of course!” “And did you so receive—did you so think of my attentions?” “Upon my word, my lord, I don't remember that I thought anything at all about them, that I perceived them even! But your self-justification is taking a strange turn. To what is all this tending, I beseech you?” “To this, Marian Hawkwood, that when I saw you daily, nightly, at York, I loved you with the whole passionate and violent devotion of a free, honest heart— that I endeavored by all means in my power, by the most eager and assiduous devotion, by all those nameless indescribable attentions, which we are taught to believe that women prize above all things—” “Women are much obliged to you, my lord, upon my word!” she interrupted him. “To let you perceive,” he continued, as if he had not heard her, “to make you understand how I adored you; and I believed that I had not been unsuccessful— I believed more, that you both saw, and appreciated, and returned my love, Marian!” “Did you, indeed?” she replied, with a bitter expression of haughtiness and scorn. “Did you, indeed, believe so? Then you were, in the first place, very unhappily mistaken; and, in the second place, egregiously misled by your vain self-conceit.” “I believe not. Mistress Marian, ladies are generally sufficiently clear-sighted in matters that concern the heart, especially when men endeavor to make those matters evident to them. I did so, and you received my attentions with very evident gratification. I do not now believe that you are in the least a coquette—though I did think so for a time—besides, I know that you love me now.” “Love you,” she replied, with a burst of fiery indignation, “nay! but I hate, scorn, loathe, detest you!” and she gave way in a moment, to a paroxysm of violent and hysterical weeping; staggered back to a garden chair; and sank into it; and lay there with her head drooping upon her breast, the big tears rolling down her checks, heavy and fast as summer's rain, and her heart throbbing and bounding as if it would break from her bosom. CHAPTER XII. Ernest de Vaux gazed on her for a moment or two, with a well satisfied and scrutinizing eye, and then crept with a noiseless foot to her side; knelt down on the turf at her feet, before the paroxysm had, in any wise, abated, and gained possession of her hand, after a moment of faint and ill-feigned resistance. “Oh! my God!” she exclaimed, “what does this mean, De Vaux?” “It means,” he answered, with a voice admirably modulated to suit his object, “it means that I adore you, that I have adored you ever, that, save you, I never loved a woman.” “How dare you?” she replied, anger again, for a moment, gaining the ascendency—“How dare you mock me thus— and your addresses to my sister—what did they mean, my lord?” “Hear me,” he said; “however it may please you to deny that you perceived my attentions, that you remember where we first met, you cannot, I think, have forgotten the morning, the accursed morning, when I came to take leave of you before setting forth to your father's house. That morning, Marian, I came with an ingenuous heart upon my lips, a heart to cast before your feet, had you been willing to receive it. But on that morning, I know not wherefore, you were a different creature; petulant, wilful, wild, repulsive; for at this moment, I must speak the truth— you checked my speech, you jeered and mocked at me, you spoke strange, whirling words against the truth, and honesty, and honor of human kind at large, and of men in particular—you said strange things about your beautiful and charming sister; till you convinced me quite, though, up to that time, I had believed that you loved me, that from the beginning you had merely been coquetting with me—that you were a vain, heartless girl, eager for admiration only, and careless of the agonies which your caprice occasioned.” “Ernest De Vaux!” “Marian Hawkwood!” “You had no right—no cause—no shadow of a reason so to surmise!” “Pardon me, lady, your conduct left no possible interpretation else. Even at this moment, when I know that it was not what I deemed it, I still am at a loss utterly to conceive your motives or your meaning. You never hinted to me even that your father was dead long ago, though I spoke to you of visiting his house. You called on me to promise that I would never whisper to your family that I had seen or known you. What could I think? what do? I went my way conceiving myself a man scorned, slighted, outraged in the tenderest and nicest point; I went my way with a heart crushed, and yet embittered—humiliated, and yet maddened.” “You had no right, I say it again; you had no right to think so; you had never spoken to me of love—never so much as hinted it; ladies do not believe that men love them, because they are civil at a morning visit—attentive at an evening ball. Oh! had you spoken to me; had you spoken to me on that fatal morning, Ernest De Vaux, all might—” “All might what, Marian, all might what?” he interrupted her, very eagerly. “All might have been understood between us,” she replied, coldly, bridling her impetuosity of speech. “But, Marian Hawkwood,” he made answer to her, “if ladies do not believe they are loved till they are told so in plain words, neither will gentlemen, unless they be consummate fools, speak those plain words until, at least, they have some little cause for believing that those words, when spoken, will be acceptable. Now, on the morning when I sought you, I fancied that I had such cause—and I did so believe— and I came to speak those plain words; but by your own changed tone, and altered manner—” “True! true!” she replied, at length, in sad and faltering tones, quite overcome by the intensity of her feelings; for, strange to say, De Vaux had, perhaps, struck on the only chord which would have at all responded to his touch; certainly on that which thrilled the most powerfully in her soul. Had he, indeed, read her mind, had he heard the thoughts expressed aloud, which had been nourished secretly within her for so long a time, he could not more skilfully have ministered to her vanity, have gratified her curiosity, have appeased her wounded self-respect, have re-awakened her half dormant passion than he did now by the course which he adopted. “True! true!” she murmured, suffering her head to fall upon her bosom in calm, sad despondency, “it is all true—too true! too true!” Her dream was then realized, she thought within herself; it was as she had fancied—hoped! He had loved her from the beginning, and her only; it was her own fault, and he! he the idol of her soul, was guiltless—alas! how prompt are we to deceive ourselves, when the deception pampers our desires! “And why,” he whispered in her ear, tenderly, “why was it so, Marian?” “You have no right to ask me, sir; and after all, your defence is faulty, is vain; nothing worth! If you loved me, even if I did misuse you, how does that palliate your treason to my sister? for shame, my lord, for shame! How dare you challenge me, or question my deeds, when your own crime glares in the eye of Heaven!” “You wrong me. Marian, and deceive yourself; I am no traitor, nor have I ever, wilfully, ever at all, wronged your sister. There is, at all times, a reaction of the heart after strong passion, checked and cast back upon itself. Outraged and wronged by one, it is natural, it is almost a necessary consequence, that we fly for consolation, for love to another. Pride, too—wounded and lacerated pride—urges us to win, where we have lost our all, in the love of woman. And so it was with me. To my own soul's deepest belief, in my most holy and most sacred conscience. I believed that I loved Annabel, as I had never loved even you. The strange similitude, blended with as strange dissimilitude, between your styles of beauty, between your tones of thought, between your characters of mind, yet more enthralled and enchained me. Then I perceived, as I thought, that Annabel did love me as truly—as you had sported with me falsely—and there, too was I mistaken! and then for the sweetest drop, the most powerful ingredient in the love philtre, arose the thought that I should be avenged on you, whom then I hated, as I had loved you once, more than all womankind united. I was happy, quiet, contented, conscious of honor—yes! Marian, I was happy! till you returned; and at the first momentary glance, the scales fell from my eyes, and I saw that you loved me, the darkness vanished from my heart, and I found that I loved you yet—as I had loved you before, madly—devotedly—for ever!” “My God! my God!” exclaimed the wretched girl, wringing her hands in the excess of mental anguish, “what have I done, that I should be so wretched?” “Why, why should you be miserable?” replied the tempter; “if it be true, as you say it is, that you did not perceive or suspect my love—that you have never cared for me—that you now hate me? Why, Marian, why should you be miserable?” “Ernest De Vaux,” answered the hapless girl, raising her pale face, and fixing her large azure eyes full on his features— “Why trouble you me any further? Between you and me there is a great gulf fixed. If you did love me, as you say, and were prevented by any girlish fears or girlish folly on my part, from speaking your love honestly—if you did as you aver, fall innocently into love for Annabel, and awake from that fancied love again at sight of me—what does it avail me now to hear this? Why do you tell it to me? unless it be to make me utterly and hopelessly wretched, by contemplating the happiness which might have been mine once, but from which I am now debarred for ever.” “It may be yours yet, Marian—if you still deem it happiness to be mine—my own—my own wife, Marian?” “How, my lord, how?” she asked with a sort of cool and concentrated indignation. “How, without utter infamy? You mistake the girl you address, my lord. You little know the heart of Marian Hawkwood, if you believe that she would break a sister's heart, or lose her own good fame, by wedding with her traitorous and rejected lover.” “Marian—she never loved me! Her calm and placid temper, her equable and quiet spirit, was not made for so violent affections, so hot passions, as true love. Even to-day”— “Hold! my lord—hold;” Marian almost fiercely interrupted him,—“not a word more; even to-day, you told that angel, whom in your wickedness you dare to slander, even to-day you told Annabel, that if I felt any passion towards you, it was a rash, unsought, and unjustifiable passion! Those were your very words— your very words to-day, when she would have resigned herself, and brought us honorably wedded. Oh! man, to lie so plansibly, and with so fair a grace, you are but too forgetful. Begone, my lord, begone! you stand self-convicted!” “Marian,” he replied solemnly, and lifting his right hand up impressively to Heaven. “This is almost too painful, but I cannot, no, I cannot permit innocence such as yours to be thus played upon by jealousy and envious selfishness; I swear to you by the honor of my father, by my mother's virtue, by Him who made, and who now listens to us both! such words as those never passed lip of mine—such thoughts were never conceived in my brain.” And it did not thunder:— Alas! that guilt is by no presage known! The tempter voice hath of the truest tone. “You did not tell her that—you did not!” cried Marian, wildly, as she sprang to her feet, “deceive me not, I adjure you, as you love me, as you hope for salvation! deceive me not, now, Ernest de Vaux! You did not tell her that?” “As I hope for salvation, I did not!” and his voice did not falter, nor his cheek blauch nor his lip quiver, as he swore, by the holiest and the highest thing that shall be, to that consummate lie! “Nay, I confessed to her the whole truth; I told her all, and all as I have told it now to you; I conjured her to pardon any wrong I might have most anintentionally wrought her— for she had told me before that, with a mien and voice as firm as mine are now. that from the moment when she knew my love for you, she had ceased entirely to regard or love me: and I implored her to reconcile us two, that together we might yet be happy?” “Can these things be?” replied Marian, gazing into his eyes as she would read his soul. “Oh! Ernest, Ernest, if you say these words from the hope of winning me, I do beseech von, I do adjure you once more, on my knees, Ernest, dear, dear Ernest—unsay, unsay it—do not, for God's sake, sow the seeds of distrust and enmity and hatred between two orphan sisters. Oh! spare me, Ernest de Vaux, spare me!” “I would to God that I could!” he answered with the most perfect and unmoved hypocrisy, “I would to God that being so adjured, I dared unsay them But for my sool, I dare not; what did she tell you, Marian?” “That you denied me—that you pronounced my love for you, rash, unsought, unjustifiable; can it be? God! God; I shall go mad; can it be, Annabel, that you so dealt with me”' “And she came back to me, and told me with calm air and pensive look, and her eyes full of hypocritical tears, `that you were so much set against me, that you would not so much as hear me—that you had sent me a fierce, scomful, passionate message, which she would not do you the wrong to deliver!” “Oh! Annabel! Sister, sister Annabel! Heaven is my judge, I would not so have done by you to win an eternity of blessings!” “And me,” whispered De Vaux softly in her ears, “can you pardon me now, my sweet Marian?” “Nay! my Lord, I have naught to pardon; we have both been deceived, first by our own misconceptions, and then, alas! alas! that it should be so! by my own sister's treason. If there be any pardon to be asked, it is I that should ask yours, De Vanx.” “It would be granted, ere it would be asked, Marian,” he replied, “but now, will you not hear me? will you not let me pray you on”— “Oh! no no, Ernest, how can it be? What, my God! what would you ask of me?” “To be mine, mine for ever—my wife, my own wife, Marian!” And he glided his haud around her waist, and drew her to his bosom; and she no longer shunned him, nor resisted, and their lips were mingled in a first kiss, as she sighed out that irrevocable yes! Alas! for Marian! “But how?” she whispered, as she extricated herself, blushing and trembling from his arms, “how can it be?” “You must fly with me, ere dawn, my love. I have a friend at Ripon, the worthy Dean, we can frame easily a tale to win him to our purpose, who will unite us! We will set forward presently, my horses are equipped even now—your palfrey shall be made ready—at the next village, we can get some country maiden, who will accompany you; at Ripon we shall overtake my brothers with the troops, and all will go happily!” At first she refused positively, then faintly and more faintly, as that false, wily man plied her with prayers and protestations— nay, tears even, and at last—oh! that we should be so weak to resist deception, when our own hearts conspire with the deceiver—at last, amid tears, and sobs, and kisses, “while saying I will ne'er consent, consented.” CHAPTER XIII. Stealthily as Marian had descended the staircase, to keep that fatal rendezvous, more stealthily yet did she return. At Annabel's door she again paused for a moment; but she paused only now to mark if she slept soundly; to hear if any breath or movement betokened that she was a wake to interrupt her. At first she heard nothing, but by and by, as her ear became more and more accustomed to the silence of the house, and as the quick beating of her own fluttering heart subsided into stillness, which for a time had filled her ears with its tumultuous murmur, she could distinguish, without difficulty, the deep and regular breathing of her slumbering sister as it became distinctly andible; and she was satisfied that from her at least she was in no danger of any interruption. Thence the unhappy girl crept into her mother's chamber; which, though it communicated with Annabel's by an open door, and though she knew that the slightest noise in that cherished chamber was wont to arouse her sister, she felt that she must visit, ere she could quit the home of her fathers, as she believed, for ever. Oh! there is something indeed holy in the atmosphere of a mother's chamber; and that holiness fell, not like a soft and gentle balm, but like a keen and acrid irritant upon the wounded spirit of the excited maiden. There was something in the whole aspect of the room unaltered from her earliest childhood—in the immovable old-fashioned furniture, which had survived in its quaint old age so many owners, which had looked on so many changes and chances; in the grim cornices and heavy scnlptured posts of the huge canopied bedstead; in the strange carvings of the vast oak mantelpiece, in the rich dark hnes of the broacaded hangings; in the tall cabinets of lacquered Indian ware; in the fantastic images embossed in gold upon their doors, at which her childhood was used to shudder; in the very ticking, slumberous and monotonous, of the old eight day clock, by which she was wont years ago to study her small tasks—there was something in all this, I say, that operated strangely, and very painfully upon the mind of Marian Hawkwood. She was embittered, angry, jealous— and yet more indignant—heart-sick at what she believed to be Anuabel's cruel treachery—than angry, or jealous either Her soul had drunk in, and received as truth, all the base falsehoods of that false and fickle lover. It was perhaps impossible, after she had taken the first false step of meeting him at all, that it should be otherwise—and resolved as she was that she would not permit the whole bliss of her life to be frustrated by the premeditated baseness of another, she yet felt and appreciated to the utmost, the whole bitterness and agony of her position. Her very heart was wrung by the idea of quitting that loved home, that cherished mother, those dear memories at all—and then to quite them, as she must, clandestinely, in shame and darkness, and dis honor—oh! it was anguish! anguish unspeakable! For a considerable time, Marian stood motionless beside the bed of the paralytic woman, happy for once, at least, in the very thing which rendered her an object of compassion—happy that she was ignorant of the sufferings and the trials, the sins and the sorrows of her beloved daughter. Wonderful, terrible contrast! the lovely face of the young girl, in its wonted aspect so bright, so radiantly beautiful, now pale alternately and flushed, harassed and agitated, nay, almost distorted, and showing in every line, every feature, the prevalence of fierce and overmastering passiou! And the calm, composed, vacant—nay! almost infantile expression of the old woman's countenance! The one in the very spring time of life, when all should be innocence and peaceful mirth, so full of unnatural and stormy tumults of the soul! The other in extreme old age, when the traces of long cares and many sorrows are expected to be stamped visibly on the lineaments, so perfectly, so deadly tranquil! For many moments she stood there, wistfully gazing on her mother's face, as it showed paler even, and more wan and death-like than its wont, in the faint moonbeans; and, as she gazed, a milder and less painful expression came over her excited features; and her sweet, blue eyes filled with tears—not the fierce scorching tears of passion, which seem to sear rather than soothe the brain, but the soft, gentle drops of penitence and moderated sorrow. She fell upon her knees beside the bed, and burying her head in her hands, remained there half reclined, her whole frame shuddering from time to time, with a sharp and convulsive tremor, and the tears flowing so abundantly that all the bed linen was moistened by her weeping. Whether she prayed, I know not—probably not in words, nor in any fixed and determined mood of humble supplication —but it would seem that she communed with herself deeply, and called on heaven to gaide and prosper her deliherations. For she uprose after a little while with a serener look and a quieter eye, and as she rose, she said, in a whisper—“No! I will not—I will not,” and had already turned to leave the chamber, when from the inner room, wherein Annabel was sleeping, there came a rustle, a short, sudden sound, which caused Marian to stop short and listen, fearful that her sister was awakening, All was still for two or three seconds, and then the noise was repeated more fondly than before, and simultaneously with the noise, several words were uttered, with that peculiar intonation which always characterizes the speech of somhambulists. Marian listened as though her soul was suspended on her sense of hearing, yet, at first, she could distinguish nothing. Annabel, however, ere long spoke again, and the second time, unhappily, her lips syllabled, but too distinetly, the fatal name of Ernest. The blood rushed to the brow of Marian in a hot burning torrent, her eyes lightened with fiery anger—she stamped her small foot passionately upon the carpet, and clinched her hand so tightly that every nail left its visible point in the palm. She ground her teeth together, and muttered through them— “Ah! is it then so—never—no! never shall she have him—never! never! never!” So slight a thing will at times suffice to change our whole souls within us—to set our blood boiling—to alter the whole tenor of our actions, our lives—to decide our destinies in this world, perchance in the world to come! One moment, Marian stood resolved to bear her sorrows boldly and nobly—to combat with the tempter, and be strong —to do her duty, let what might come of it! The next, and the good resolve was swept from her heart by the wild rush of a thousand evil and bitter thoughts—anger—resentment—jealousy—ambition— pride! And what—what was the puissant spelt that had evoked these baneful spirits—baneful indeed—for fatal was their cousequence to her, and to all those that loved her—these chance words spoken by a disturbed and feverish sleeper! Alas! she paused no more, nor looked again on her scarce living mother, nor gave heed to the memories which had but now so nearly won her; but rushed away with fleet and noiseless steps to her own chamber, and then busily applied herself to her brief preparations. Brief indeed were the preparations which she had the time or the disposition to make, on that night!—she dressed herself repidly, and almost mechanically, in a dark riding dress and velvet cap, hurriedly thrust a single change of raiment, and the small casket which contained her few simple jewels, into a light travelling bag of scented cordovan leather, which had by chance been left in her room when the rest of her baggage was removed on her return from York; and was, within a quarter of an hour, prepared to set off on fier untimely journey, whither she knew not, nor when to return again! While she was thus engaged, a little incident occurred, perhaps scarce worth recording; yet so much wisdom may be deduced oftentimes from observation of the smallest and most seemingly trivial incident, and so strongly did this, I think, denote the extreme perturbation of her mind, that I will not, trifling although be it, leave it unmentioned. While she was on her knees, busily packing up her case, a beautiful tortoiseshell cat, a soft glossy creature, which she had reared up from a little kitten, and taught to follow her about like a dog, jumped down out of a large arm-chair in which it had been dozing and trotted towards her with its tail erect, uttering a small note of pleasure and affectionate recognition. In a moment seeing itself unnoticed it laid its velvet paw upon the arm of its young mistress with an impatient mew—but she, pre-occupied with quick and burning thoughts, repulsed her with so rude a hand, that she was thrown off to a yard's distance, and stood gazing as if in astonishment at so unkindly treatment from one who had always fondled her and fed her. The very moment after she had done this, as if repenting the action, she caught up the little animal in her arms, and burst into tears, as she kissed and addressed it, as if it had been a human creature. “Good bye,” said she, “good bye, poor Pussy; I shall never see you any more; you will be fed by other hands, you will forget your poor mistress, Pussy. Yet happier will you be than I—for you will not be driven from your pleasant home—you are not betrayed or deserted by your friends—you are not wronged by those you love—for you love no one— happy creature! love no one but her only to whom you look for food—happy, happy creature! and when she quits you, will love equally the next hand that shall fondle you!—for you, thrice happy that you are! you are not cursed with memory, nor with affection, nor with passion— those agonies to which we are subject.” Then, for some minutes, she wept very bitterly, still holding the cat in her arms, purring with pleasure, and patting its fair mistress's cheek with its velvet paws— until the distant sound of a horse's foot upon the gravel road smote on her ear, a summons to quit the home of her youth, the friends of her childhood—and for what? When she heard it, she raised her head, and gazed about her wildly, as if to collect her thoughts, lifted her eyes to heaven, while her lips moved very rapidly as if in inward prayer. “May God forgive me!” she said, rising, “if this thing which I do is evil; and oh! may he guard and guide my steps aright —and may he pardon those who have driven me to this!” And then, without another word, she laid her little favorite gently down on the bed, and snatching up the leathern case which she had made ready, she hurried out of the room, not once casting her eyes behind her, for she felt that if she did so her resolution was at an end at once, and stole down stairs, silent and trembling between fear and apprehension, and something near akin to remorse. No sound this time came to appal her; no obstacle occurred to interrupt her progress, yet she shuddered as she stood on the threshold of that once happy home, and a quick ehillv spasm ran over her whole frame, as if it were an ague fit. Her fate, however—or at least that which men call fate, the stnbborn and determined energy of her own erring passion—cried out within her, and nerved her body to do that which she knew to be imprudent, and almost knew to be wrong likewise. She raised the latch of the front door, and issued forth, closing it carefully behind her, and stood upon the stone steps, gazing with a wistful eye over the calm and tranquil scenery of that fair valley. The antumn mora was already breaking in the east, ere yet the moonlight had faded altogether from the sky—the heavens were pure and cloudless, and colorless as a huge vault of crystal, except where on the horizon a faint yellowish hue was visible, first harbinger of the approaching sun. There was not a breath of wind astir; even on the topmost branches of the tall trees about the hall, the sere leaves, ready to flutter down at the slightest breath, hung motiouless—here and there a grey mist wreath soared up ghostlike, in a straight column, from some small pond or lakelet, and a light smoky haze marked the whole course of the Wharfe througt the lowlands; the frosted dew lay silvery while over the lawn and meadows—and not a sound or tone of any kind except the continuous murmur of the neighboring rivulet, swelling the louder for the cessation of all other noises, was to be heard through the sleeping country. The earliest bird had not yet left its roost, the very dogs were in their heaviest slumber. And Marian, oppressed as she was by sad thoughts and heavy memories, felt that the silence was yet more oppressive—spoke more reproachfully to her conscience than the loudest and most vehement rebukes. Those might have called forth anger and awakened in her heart the spirit of resistance; this, on the contrary, appealed to her better reason, and voiceless in its wholesome admonition, led her to self-blame and self-accusation. Had she stood many minutes there aloue, with no other comrade than her own restless and tormenting thoughts, it is probable that she would have found their burden intolerable, and have taken refuge from them in a return to her duty; but, alas! ere the re-action came, the voice of the tempter again sounded in her ear; and he, she loved so madly, stood beside her. “Sweet Marian,” he murmured, gently passing his arm round her slender waist, “why did you tarry so long? I almost feared that something had occurred to detain you—I fancied that your sister might have awakened, and perhaps, have even used force to prevent you. Come, dearest, come, the horses are prepared and await us by the hawthorn bush under the hillock.” Was it chance—was it accursed and premeditated art, that led De Vaux to utter the one word that thrilled every chord of her soul, that instantly attuned her to his purpose, banishing every soft and tender memory, and kindling jealousy and distrust, and almost hatred, in that impulsive soul, from which they had been gradually fading, under the better influence of quiet thought, aided by the tranquillizing and harmonious sympathies of nature? I know not—but she started as if a serpeut stung her, when the word sister fell upon her ear; and though she had almost shrunk from De Vaux as he first approached, with something more than the mere timidity of maiden bashfulness, she now gave him her hand quickly, and said, in an eager, apprehensive voice—“Come! come!” He led her down the gentle slope to the spot, where a single groom, an old, grave-featured, grey-haired man, was holding two horses, and her favorite palfrey. He lifted her to her saddle, sprang to his own, and, without another word, they rode away, gently and heedfully, till they had left the precincts of the park behind them; but when they had once gained the road, they fled at a rate that would have almost defied pursuit, had there been any to pursue them. But there were none—nor was her flight discovered until she had been gone above two hours. The morning broke, like that which had preceded it, serene, and bright, and lovely; the grent sun rushed up the blie vault in triumphant splendor, all nature laughed out in his glory—but at a later hour far later than usual, no smoke was seen curling from the precinets of the hall, or sigu of man or beast was visible about its precincts. The passionate scenes, the wild excitement of the preceding day, had brought about, as usual, a deep re-action; and sleep sat heavily on the eyelids, or the souls of the inmates. The first who awoke was Annabel—Annabel, the bereaved and almost widowed bride. CHAPTER XIV. Dressing herself in haste she sought, as usual, her mother's chamber and found her happy—oh! how supremely happy in her benighted state, since she knew not, nor understood at all, the sorrows of those whom she once had loved so tenderly— found her in a deep calm slumber—kissed her brow silently, and breathed a fond prayer over her, then hurried thence to Marian's chamber. The door stood open, it was vacant! Down the stairs to the garden—the door that led to that sweet spot was barred and bolted—the front door stood upon the latch, and by that Annabel passed out into the fresh young morning. How fair, how peaceable, how calm, was all around her—how utterly unlike the strife, the trials, the cares, the sorrows, the hot hatreds of the animated world—how utterly unlike the auxious pains which were then gnawing at that fair creature's heart strings! She stood awhile, and gazed around, and listened, but no sound met her ear. except the oft-heard music of the wind and water—except the well-known points of that familiar scene; she walked—she ran—a fresh fear struck her, a fear of she knew not what—she flew to the garden— “Marian! Marian!”—but no Marian came! no voice made answer to her shrill outcries—back! back! she hurried to the house, but in her way she crossed the road feading to the stables—there were fresh horse—tracks—several fresh horse-tracks—one which looked like the print of Marian's palfrey! Without a moment's hesitation, she rushed into the stable court; no groom was there, nor stable boy, nor helper—and yet the door stood open, and a loud tremulous neighing, Annabel knew it instantly to be the call of her own jennet, was awakening unanswered echoes. She stood a moment like a statue before she could command herself to cross the threshold. She crossed it, and the stall where Marian's palfrey should have stood, next her own, was vacant. The chargers of De Vaux were gone; the horses of his followers—all—all gone! She shrieked alond—she shrieked, till every pinnacle and turret of the old hall, till every dell and headland of the hills, sent back a yelling echo. It scarcely seemed a second before the court-yard, which, a moment since, was so silent and deserted, was full of hurrying men and frightened women—the news was instantly abroad that Mistress Marian had been spirited away by the false lord. Horses were saddled instautly and broad-swords girded on, and men were mounting in hot haste, ere Aunabel had in so much recovered from the shock as to know what to order or advise—evil and hasty counsels had been taken, but the good vicar and the prebendary came down in time to hinder them. A hurried consultation was held in the honse, and it was speedily determined, that the two clergymen should set forth on the instant, with a sufficient escort to pursue, and if it should be possible, bring back the fugitive—and although Annabel at the first was in despair, fancying that there could be no hope of her being overtaken, yet was she some what reassured on learning that De Vaux could not quit his regiment, and that the slow route of the troopers on a long march could easily be caught up even by aged travellers. The sun was scarce three hours high when the pursuers started—all that day long it lagged across the sky—it set, and was succeeded by night, longer still, and still more dreary—another day! and yet another! Oh the slow agony of waiting! the torture of enumerating minutes!— each minute seemingly an age—the dull, heart-sickening suspense of awaiting tidings—tidings which the heart tells us— the heart, too faithful prophet of the future—cannot, by possibility, be good! While reason interposes her vain veto to the heart's decision, and hope uplifts her false and siren song! The third night was at hand, and Annabel was sitting at the same window—how often it occurs, that one spot witnesses the dozen scenes most interesting, most eventful to the same individual. Is it, that consciousness of what has passed, leads man to the spot marked by one event, when he expects another? or can it be indeed a destiny? The third night was at hand, and Annabel was sitting at that same window, when on the distant highway she heheld her friends returning, but they rode heavily and sadly onward; nor was there any flutter of female garbs among them. Marian was not among them! They came —the story was soon told!—they had succeeded in overtaking the regiment, they had seen Ernest, and Marian was his wife! The register of her marriage, duly attested, had been shown to her uncle in the church at Ripon, and though she had refused to see them, she had sent word that she was well and happy, with many messages of love and cordiality to Annabel, and promises that she would write at short and frequent intervals. No more was to be done—nothing was to be said at all. Men marvelled at De Vaux, and envied him! Women blamed Marian Hawkwood, and they, too, envied! But Annabel said nothing—but went about her daily duties, tending her helpless mother, and answering her endless queries concerning Marian's absence, and visiting her pensioners among the village poor, seemingly cheerful and contented. But her cheek constantly grew paler, and her form thinner and less round. The sword was hourly wearing out the scabbard! The spirit was too mighty for the vessel that contained it. Five years passed thus—five wearisome long years—years of domestic strife and civil war, of bloodshed, conflagration, and despair throughout all England. The party of the king, superior at the first, was waxing daily weaker, and was almost lost. For the first years Marian did write, and that, too, frequently and fondly, to her sister; never alluding to the past, and seldom to De Vaux, except to say that he was all she wished him, and she more happy than she hoped, or deserved to be But gradually did the letters become less frequent and more formal; communications were obstructed, and posts were intercepted, and scarce, at last, did Annabel hear twice in twelve months of her sister's welfare. And when she did hear, the correspondence had become cold and lifeless; the tone of Marian, too, was altered, the bnoyancy was gone—the mirth—the soul—and, though she complained not, nor hinted that she was unhappy, yet Annabel saw plainly that it was so. Saw it, and sorrowed, and said nothing. Thus time passed on, with all its tides and chances, and the old paralytic invalid was gathered to her fathers, and slept beside her husband in the yard of the same humble church which had beheld their union, and Annabel was more alone than ever. CHAPTER XV. Five years had elapsed since Marian had fled from Ingleborough Hall, and, as I have said already, Annabel knew but little what had passed with the cherished sister since her flight. She knew, indeed, that for the first years of her marriage she was happy; and so joyously did she sympathize with that happiness, so sincerely did her letters, whenever she had an opportunity of writing, express that sympathy, unmixed with any touch of jealousy or enviousness, that Marian could not long resist the growth of the conviction, strengthened at every renewal of the correspondence, that Ernest had deceived her, in the account by which he had prevailed on her to elope with him It is not, perhaps, very strange, however—for we cannot call anything strange with propriety that is of usual occurrence—that, so long as Ernest de Vaux continued to be the rapturous lover, and after that, the gentle and assiduous husband, she felt no resentment, nor indeed any inclination to blame him for the deceit, which had produced happy results only to herself, and had resulted in no permanent estrangement or breach of confidence between herself and Annabel. What contributed moreover, in no slight degree to this placability on Marian's part, was that, without ever actually confessing that he had spoken falsely, De Vaux, as soon as she was once irrevocably his, exerted himself to palliate the conduct of Annabel, representing it as a natural result of galled and wounded feelings, as a lapse to be pitied rather than blamed severely, and effectually succeeded in re-establishing kind thoughts in her heart, and so— for poor Annabel never knew nor imagined aught of Marian's causeless suspicion and dislike—brought the sisters back to their wonted footing of perfect familiarity and untrammelled confidence. Still, in despite of this, thought Marian had nothing which she desired to conceal from her sister, except what she believed to be the solitary instance of deception in her husband—which, though she excused it to herself as a sort of pious fraud, necessary to ensure her happiness, she yet felt as it were intnitively that Annabel could neither regard in that light, nor ever pardon very readily—though Marian, I say, had nothing except this which she desired to conceal, and though her sister was the very soul of frankness and ingenuous truth, still any correspondence, even the freest and most unreserved, is but a sorry substitute for personal intercourse and conversation, and can at best but convey very slightly, an idea of the true state of sentiments, emotions, and events, especially when they are protracted through a long course of years. Events, and the course of the earlier part of the civil war, which was waged for the most part in the southern and midland counties, had prevented the sisters from meeting, Annabel remaining, during the lifetime of her beloved mother, assiduously and earnestly devoted to her comforts, while Marian, for the most part, followed the court of the unhappy Charles, who, still at Oxford or elsewhere, kept up the semblance, at least, of his kingly style, and held his parliament of such peers as remained true to the cause of their own order, of the church and the crown. Among all the bold cavaliers, who fought and bled so generously for the unhappy king, the most unhappy and least vicious of an unhappy vicious race, there was not one more gallant, one who achieved more glory than De Vaux. Among all the fair dames, aristocrats of nature, as of birth, who graced the halls of declining royalty, there was not one more lovely, more admired, or more followed, than the bright and still happy Marian. Delighted by the fame and honors which daily fell more thickly on her husband, amused, pleased, and dazzled by the novelty of her position, for a considerable time Marian believed herself perfectly happy, as she believed herself also to be devotedly beloved by her husband. The very hurry and turmoil in the midst of which she necessarily lived, was not without its wild and half pleasurable excitement—after custom and experience, and the seeing him return home victorious and unwounded, had steeled her against the terrors and the anguish which assailed her at first, whenever he rode forth to bat there was a sort of charm in the short absences, from which he ever hurried home, as it appeared more fond and more enamored than in the first days of her wedded life. This hurry and turmoil, moreover, afforded to De Vaux constant and plausible excuses by which to account for and mask his irregularities, which became in truth more and more frequent, as the fresh character and lovely person of his wife gradually palled on him by possession. For in truth he was a wild, reckless, fickle man—not by any means all evil, or without many generous and gentle impulses, although these had been growing daily weaker and less frequent through a life of self-indulgence and voluptuousness, till very little was now left of his original promise, save courtly manners, a fair exterior, and—simply to do him justice—a courage as indomitable, cool, and sustained, as it was vigorous and fiery. He lived in a period of much license— he was the eldest son of a doating father —he had lost his mother, while he was yet a mere boy—all three vast disadvantages—vast misfortunes to a young man. Indulged to the utmost of his wild and fantastic wishes by his father, encouraged rather than checked in those extravagances which the cavaliers of the day affected somewhat, in order to mask their detestation of the cold-blooded hypocrisy and ridiculously insincere profession of those most odious impostors who constituted the vast majority of the Puritanic leaders—launched very young into the world, with handsome person, courtly manners, high rank, and almost boundless wealth, his success with the women of the court, in an age the most licentious England had then witnessed, was wide and unbounded. He had already become the most hardened being in the world, a cool voluptuary, a sensual, luxurious, calculating courtier, when he met Marian at the Sheriff's ball, at York, and was struck instantly by her extraordinary beauty. Having approached her in consequence of this admiration, tired as he was, and sick of the hackneyed and artificial characters, the affectations, and minauderies, and want of heart of all the women with whom he had as yet been familiar, he was soon yet more captivated by the freshness of her soul, the artlessness of her manner, the frank, ingennous, off-handed simplicity of her bright, innocent youth, fearless of wrong, and unsuspicious of evil, than he had been by her beauty. So that before he was compelled by paramount duty—the only duty which he owned, military duty namely—to quit York, he was as much in love as his evil course of life and acquired habits had left him the power of being, with the sweet country maiden. That is to say—he had determined that the possession of her was actually necessary to his existence, and a thing to be acquired on any terms—nay! he had even thought many times, that she might be endurable for a much longer period than any of his former loves, and begun to fancy, that, when his passion should have settled down into esteem, he might be able to tolerate in Maria Hawkwood, the character he dreaded most in the world, that of a lawful wife. There was something in the whole air and demeanor of Marian Hawkwood, that told the young debauchee, almost instinctively, that there was but one name in which she could be addressed—a purity and innocence of heart and manner, likewise, which would have prevented the most dissolute and daring of mankind from dreaming even of approaching her with dishonorable addresses. Now, it was difficult for a man of De Vaux's character and principles—if that can be called principle which is rather a total absence of all principle—accustomed to doubt and disbelieve and to sneer at the possibility of female virtue, to bring himself to the resolution of deliberately offering his hand to any woman, how passionately he might be attached to her soever; and this difficulty of making up his own mind it was, and not any timidity or bashfulness —things utterly strange and unknown to his hard and worldly nature—which caused that irresolution which had given offence so deep to Maria Hawkwood. It cannot be denied that her manner on that interview did pique and provoke him beyond measure—that it threw him into doubt as to the question whether she did indeed love him or not, and by awakening for a moment an idea of the possibility of his being rejected—an idea which had never so much as occurred to him before, even casually, materially increased his dislike to subsiding into a tranquil and domestic Benedict. These were the real reasons for his seemingly extraordinary conduct towards Marian in the first place; and not at all that which he had stated, for he had been indeed false—false from the beginning. It was then in a singular state of mind, vexed with himself and irritated at finding himself subject to a passion seemingly hopeless, annoyed that he was unable to shake off that passion lightly, indignant with Marian for not appreciating sufficiently the honor he had done her, in so much as thinking of making her his wife, foiled, furious, discontented, and devoured all the time by the agony of his fierce desire—for it is mere profanation to call that which he felt, love—he set forth from York to visit, as he imagined, the father of his cruel fair one. Many wild schemes and projects flitted through his mind as he journeyed westward, which it were neither profitable nor pleasing to follow out; but each and all of these had reference to winning Marian in some shape or other, and at some period not remote. What occurred when he reached Ingleborough, is known already to those who have thus far followed the fortunes of the sisters; but what in truth passed in the recesses of his own heart has never been divulged, nor can be known to any one. It may be that pique and anger at Marian's manner when they parted had really disposed him, as he said, to love another honestly and truly; it may be that the exquisite repose and charming sweetness of Annabel did indeed win upon his soul, and work for the time a partial reformation—but what alone is certain is, that he felt more of that repugnance to sacrificing what he called his liberty, which had actuated him with regard to Marian, when he proposed to Annabel. It may be, on the other hand—and it would be by no means inconsistent either with his past character or after conduct— that frokle and light as he was, and very liable to be captivated for the moment by the charms of women, that, I say, he was influenced by a twofold motive—twofold and doubly base—of gratifying a passing caprice in marrying Annabel, and inflicting the heaviest punishment he could imagine on her sister at the same time. It is probable, even, that he might have had baser and more infamous projects in view, with respect to poor Marian; and it is certain that he looked to the disturbed and perilous state of the country, as to a favorable position of things to his purpose, should he desire to abandon his fair young wife, after a time—seeing that she had no influential relations to protect her, and that if peace should be restored at last, little inquiry was likely to be made after affairs of mere personal consideration. Frustrated in his intentions by the return of Marian, and by her inability to conceal the violence of the hopeless love which she still nourished for her sister's wooer, although she nourished it without one thought of evil entering her pure spirit, having betrayed moreover his own maddening passion, which returned upon him with redoubled violence, when he was thrown again into her society, he could not endure the scorn, the contempt, which he felt gathering around him, nor bear the publicity of his disappointment. It was the fear of this publicity, then, and the determination that he would, under no circumstances, leave Ingleborough in the character of a rejected and disappointed suitor, that induced him to renew his solicitations to poor Marian. Shrewd and keen sighted, and able judge of character as he was, he readily perceived that in the calm and composed soul of Annabel Hawkwood, there was a deep settled principle, a firm and resolute will, a determination capable of calling forth any powers, whether it were to do or endure. It required, therefore, little reflection to show him that with her he had now no possibility of succeeding—that once detected, as he felt himself to be, his whole mind and motives perused and understood as if they had been written out in a fair book for her inspection, the very love which she had entertained for him in the past, would but the more strongly arm her against him in the present Nor was this all—for even his effrontery was at fault, even his natural audacity shrank from encountering the tranquil scorn, the quiet and unutterable loathing which he saw visible in every glance of her mild eye. Ere long, between the sense that he had irreparahly injured her, and the knowledge that she understood him thoroughly, he came to hate her with a vehement and bitter hatred. In this hatred, too, he found a new instigation to persevere in his attempts on Marian, for he was certain that, although the ordinary sources of annoyance, envy or jealousy, could never inflict a single sting on Annabel, he could wreak no heavier vengeance on her than by making her beloved sister his wife—the wife of a man whom she despised so utterly—and he acknowledged it in his own secret soul—so worthily. Unhappily, in the impulsive and impetuous character of Marian, which he had studied to its inmost depths, he encountered no such resistance as he knew he should encounter from her sister. Falsehoods which would have been discovered instantly and rejected with scarce a consideration, by the quiet thoughtfulness and innocent penetration of the elder sister, wakened suspicions in the quicker mind of the younger, galled her to the very quick, dwelt in her heart, filling it with bitterness and gall, and at last ripened into terrible and dark convictions of the unworthiness of her who was, in truth, the best of sisters, and the tenderest of friends. These were the motives—these the means of Ernest De Vaux—and we have seen, alas! how fully they succeeded. What are the necessary consequences of a marriage contracted with such views as these, founded upon a man's caprice for a woman whom he would have made his mistress if he could, and only made his wife because he could by no other means possess her, cannot be doubted. Nothing at first could be happier than Marian Hawkwood — for she mistook, naturally enough, the fierce and violent passion of her young husband for genuine and veritable love; and, indeed, after saticty and possession had long dulled the ardor of this passion, circumstances for a long time conspired to keep up the illusion in the mind of Marian. The hurried and changeful life which they led; the very large portion of their time which was passed, to a certain degree, in public; the gratified vanity of her husband at the admiration which she excited everwhere, and which delighted his vain and fickle temperament long after he had ceased himself to care for her, all tended to delay the fatal discovery, which it was clear that she must one day make, that she was loved no longer. At first, as she perceived that his attentions were declining, that he no longer hurried homeward with eager haste, his duty in the camp or in the court accomplished, that the revel or the dice detained him, she threw the blame on the unsettled times, on the demoralizing influence of civil warfare, and wild company, and the want of a permanent and happy home. She prayed, and believed that with the war these things, which were converting fast her life into one scene of sorrow, would come to an end, and that shortly. But neither did the war, nor the sorrows which she attributed to that war, seem likely to be brought to any speedy or even favorable termination. No children had blessed that ill-fated union, and Marian, when she did not, in obedience to the order of her husband, go into the court gaieties, such as they were at that time, was almost entirely alone. Alone she brooded in despondency, almost in despair, over her hapless present life, and almost hopeless future. Write to her sister of her griefs she could not; where was the use of torturing that worn heart with other sorrows, when she must needs have enough sorrow of her own. Abroad she was subject to the twofold agony of witnessing the bold and open faithlessness of her husband, his infamous addresses to the wild and licentious beauties, made, perhaps, wild and licentious by the extravagance of their natural protectors, and the strange and corrupting circumstances of the times—and of enduring the base solicitations and addresses of the gay friends of her husband—solicitations and addresses which she could scarce believe were unknown to him, who, most of all men, should have resented and avenged them. Thus year by year dragged on, until Marian, thoroughly convinced of her husband's infidelity and baseness, which, indeed, he scarce now affected to conceal, was the most miserable of her sex. All her high spirits had taken to themselves wings, and flown away—all her wild daring elasticity of character—tameless gaiety, which was so beautiful of old —her strong impulsive frankness—were broken, gone, obliterated. She had become a quiet, sad, heart-broken, meditative creature Yet she repined not ever— nor approached him—nor gave way to sadness in his presence—but strove, poor wretch, to put on a semblance of the manners which he had once seemed to love, and her pale lips still wore a sickly smile as he drew near, and a wild cheerfulness would animate her for a moment; if, by chance, he spoke kindly, a hope would arise within her that he might still be reclaimed to the ways of virtue and of love. But still the hope was deferred, and her heart grew sick, and utter gloom took possession of her; so that she now looked forward to no other termination of her sorrows than the grave; and to that she indeed looked forward, at what time it should seem good to Him to send it, who orders all things, and all wisely. CHAPTER XVI. Thus then had the days passed with Marian during those years of which her sister knew so little, each day sadder and bearing less of hope than the last. She had heard of her mother's death, that mother whom she had once so cherished, whose memory was still so dear to her— yet had those gloomy tidings brought no increase to the unhappy wife's cold sadness. No! so completely had the harden ing touch of despair petrified all her feelings, that she now felt that nothing could increase or diminish the burden under which she labored. If she thought of the dead at all, it was to envy, not weep—it was to clasp her hands, and turn her eyes up to heaven, and to cry—“Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit; for they rest from their labors!” And worse every day, and more vicious—aye! and more loathsome and more cruel in his vices, did Ernest de Vaux show himself. Alas!—the career of vice is as it were on a road up a steep mountain's side. There is no halting on the way, no standing still—no power of remaining where you are. Upward or downward, you must on, and on for ever! Upward with conscientious hopes and earnest struggles and energetical resolves to virtue, and to honor, and to peace—or downward, with headlong speed, to crime, and agony, and ruin, and that perdition which shall not end when all things else have reached their termination. Alas! I say—alas! for this latter was the path in which the steps of De Vaux were hurrying, and towards this termination. From gentlemanly vice, as it is falsely called, and those extravagances or excesses rather, of which men, deemed by the world honorable, may be guilty without losing caste, Ernest began now to degenerate into low profligacy, vulgar habitual debauchery! His noble features and fine form had already begun to display the symptoms of habitual intemperance; his courtly manners and air once so noble had deteriorated sadly; his temper, so equable and mild, and at the least in outward show so kindly, had become harsh, and quernlous, uneven, and at times violent and brutal. Yet Marian still clung to him, faithful in weal and woe, in wealth as in poverty— for at times, in the changes and chances of the civil war, they had in truth undergone much hardship—she was still the unchanged, unrepining, fond consoler— but alas! how cruelly, and how often were her sweet consolations cast back upon her, her kind and affectionate advances met with harsh words, and bitter menaces—and once! yes, once, when the mad demon of intoxication was all powerful within him—yes! once with a blow. It was the fifth year of the civil war, and though many fierce and sanguinary fields had been fought, many towns taken, many halls and manor-houses stormed and defended, much generous, noble blood prodigally wasted, neither side yet had gained anything of real or permanent advantage. It was the fifth year of the civil war, and the Marquis of Newcastle, one of the most accomplished and gallant noblemen of the day, was holding York for the King, though besieged with an over-whelming force, by the united forces of the English puritans and independents, under Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, and the Scotch covenanters, under David Leslie, and many of the Protestant Lords of the sister kingdom. The siege had indeed lasted some time, but although those within the city were beginning to look eagerly for the relief which was expected daily from Prince Rupert, they were not as yet straitened for provision, or dispirited. And here in the midst of present apprehension, and perhaps soon to be in the midst of peril, here in the very city, wherein she had passed those few bright days, the brightest and the happiest of her life, alas! that they should have led to consequences so cruelly disastrous—here in a poor mean lodging in a small narrow street, nigh Stonegate, dwelt the once bright and happy Marian. It was night, and although summer time, the air was exceeding damp and chilling. It was night, dead might, and quite dark, for there was no moon, and the skies were so cloudy that the faint glimmer of the stars failed to pierce their thick folds. There were no sounds abroad in the beleagnered city but the distant call from hour to hour of the answered sentinel, and the occasional tramp and clash of arms, as the grand rounds passed through the streets to visit the outposts, or the relief parties marched toward the walls. At this dead hour of the night, in a small wretched parlor scantily furnished with a few common wooden chairs, a coarse oak table on which stood a brazen lamp diffusing a pale uncertain light through the low roofed apartment, and sufficing barely to show the extreme poverty and extreme cleanliness of that abode of high born beauty, sat Marian, Lady de Vaux, plainly attired, and in no wise becomingly to her high station, pale, wan, and thin, and careworn, and no more like to the Marian Hawkwood of old days than the poor disembodied ghost to the fair form it once inhabited. The floor of the wretched room was neatly sanded, for it was carpetless, and no curtains veiled the small latticed casements—the walls were hung with defensive armor and a few weapons, two or three cloaks and feathered hats, disposed with a sad attempt at symmetrical arrange ment and decoration—four or five books some paper and materials for writing, and an old lute lay on the table by which Marian was sitting, and on another smalle board at a little distance, neatly arranged with a clean white cloth, stood a loaf of bread, the remnants, now very low reduced, of a sirloin, and a half bottle of red wine—the supper prepared by the haples wife, herself fasting and hungered, for the base recreant husband. An open Bible lay before Marian on the board, but though her eyes rested on the blessed promises, and her hands at times as if mechanically turned its pages, her mind was far away, suspended on every distant sound that rose from the deserted streets, starting at every passing footstep with a strange mixture as it seemed of eager expectation and wild fear. At length a quick, strong, heavy tread came up the street, and paused under the window. “It is he,” she said, listening intently with a deep crimson flush rising to her whole face, but receding rapidly, and leaving only two round hectic spots high up on her cheek bones. “Thank God it is he at last!” and she arose and trimmed the lamp, and drew the little table forward with the preparation for his supper—but, as the door below yielded to the pass-key which he carried, she started and turned white as ashes; for the sound of a second step reached her ears, and the soft cadence of a female voice. She paused, with her whole soul intent upon the sound, and as they came nearer and nearer, and more and more distinct— “My God!” she said to herself, in a low choked whisper clasping her hands together, as if in mortal anguish, “my God! it cannot be!” But it was—it was, as she dreaded, as she would not believe! Shame on the dastard villain! it was true! The door opened suddenly, and Ernest de Vaux entered, with a tall and exceedingly handsome woman leaning upon his arm, whom Marian recognished the very moment their eyes met, for the Lady Agnes Trevor, of whose bold and shameless conduct with her husband she had long heard, though she strove to close her ears to them, a thousand cruel rumors. This last worst outrage, however, was not without its effect; even the worm, when trodden under foot, will, it is said, rise up against its torturer; and even her base husband was astonished at the superb and stately majesty with which the wronged and heart-broken woman drew herself up, as they entered, at the flash of grand indignation which lightened from every speaking feature; if he had calculated that her spirit was so utterly cowed and broken, that she would endure everything in silence, madly had he erred, and tremendously was he now undeceived. Even the guilty woman who accompanied him, started back in dismay; it would appear even that she had not known before whither he was conducting her, for she shrank back aghast, and clung to his arm yet closer than before, as she asked in a tremulous and agitated tone, “Who is this, who is this lady? Ernest!” “It is his wife, madame!” replied Marian, taking a forward step; “his wedded wife, for whom it is rather to ask, who you are, that intrude thus upon her, at this untimely hour?” “It is my wife, Agnes,” answered De Vaux at the same moment; “my wife, who will be happy to extend her hospitality to you, until these most unhappy jars are ended, and you reconciled to my lord; Marian, it is the Lady Agnes Trevor, who asks your welcome; assure her”— “I do assure her—” replied Marian, haughtily; “that she is perfectly, fully welcome to enjoy all the comforts, all the hospitalities which this roof has to offer— this roof”— “Why, that is well,” replied her husband, with a sneering smile, “I told you, Agnes, she would be very glad to receive you, she is a sweet, mild, patient little creature, this pretty wife of mine!” “This roof,” continued Marian, “which, from this hour, shall never cover my head any more.” “Heyday! heyday! what is all this? what does this mean”— “It means, simply, that hitherto I have borne much, have borne all—but infamy, and infamy I will bear never. Fare-you-well, sir; may you repent, I say—may you repent, I say, and ere it be too late, and may you,” she added, turning to the frail beauty, who trembled in her presence, “may you never know the agonies which you have heaped upon my soul?” And she passed by them, with a movement so impetuously rapid, that she was out of the door before Ernest, to whom Agnes Trevor was clinging still in mortal terror, could interpose to arrest her flight But recovering himself, instantly he darted after and caught her by her dress, and would have dragged her back into the room, but she laid hold of the balustrades of the staircase, and clung to them so strongly, that he could not move her. “Do you so little know me, Marian,” he exclaimed furiously, “as to imagine that I would suffer my wife to go forth alone, a mark for evil tongues, at such an hour as this—back! Madam Marian— back to your chamber, or you will force me to do that I shall be sorry for!” “Sorry for!” answered Marian, with calm scorn, “you sorry for aught of injury to me! and do you, sir, so little know me as to imagine that I would stay one moment under the same roof with your”— “With my what—with my what, madam?” shouted De Vaux, “beware how you answer!” “Unhand me, sir, unhand me!” she replied, “unhand me; for I will go forth!” “Answer me—with my what? under the same roof with my what?” he again exclaimed, shaking her violently by the arm. “With your harlots, sir,” she replied, firmly, and at the same moment two fearful sounds followed her words; one the most fearful sound, perhaps, that can be heard on earth at all; the sound of a heavy blow dealt by a man to a weak woman; the other a wild, piercing female yell—a yell that echoed far and wide through the midnight city. But it came not, that awful shriek, from the lips of Marian. No, no; it was the reckless, the abandoned outcast wife of the Lord Albert Trevor, that uttered the heart-rending cry, as she rushed, with a frantic air, out of the chamber, and throwing herself at the feet of her seducer, and clasping his knees wildly with one hand, caught with the other his upraised right arm—upraised again to smite her whom he had sworn to love and honor. “Me, me!” she cried, “oh, God—me! me! not her—strike me—strike me, not her! for I deserve it—deserve it all—all— all—me, as she rightly termed me; me, the outcast—the harlot!” And with so powerful a grasp, moved by the ecstasy of remorse and frenzy, did the frail creature restrain the ruffian's fury, that he was forced to stoop down and exert some power to remove her. But the moment Marian perceived what was passing, she darted down the stairs, and through the front door, which she closed violently behind her, and into the vacant street, and fled with a speed that soon set pursuit at defiance. That night she slept at her old uncle's house in the Minster yard, the following day York was relieved, and the siege of the Puritans raised by the fiery Rupert. On the third morning the royal troops sallied forth to give battle to the troops of Fairfax upon the fatal Moor of Long Marston, and while the roar of cannon was deafening the ears of all for miles around her, and her had husband was charging in the maddest strife, Marian was hurrying home to die—hurrying home to die in the calm shades of Wharfdale. CHAPTER XVII. Thus things went on in the busy world abroad, and at home in the quiet vale of Ingleborough, until some few days after the deadly fight and desperate defeat at Long Marston. Autumn had come again—brown autum—and Annabel, now in her garden tending her flowers, and listening to her birds, and thinking of the past, not with the keen and piercing anguish of a present sorrow, but with the mellow recollection of an old regret. She stood beside the stream—the stream that all unchanged itself had witnessed such sad changes in all that was around it—close to the spot where she had talked so long with Marian on that eventful morning, when a quick, soft step came behind her; she turned, and Marian clasped her! No words can describe the feelings of the sisters as they met; and it was not till after many a fond embrace, and many a burst of tears, that Marian told her that how, after years of sufferance, compelled at last to fly from the outrageous cruelty of him, for whom she had thrown up all but honor, she now came home—home, like the hunted hare to her form, like the wounded bird to her nest—she now came home to die. “What could it boot,” she said, “to repeat the old and oft-told tale,” how eager passion made way for uncertain and oft-interrupted gleams of fondness—how a love founded on no esteem or real principles, melted like wax before the fire—how inattention paved the way for neglect, and infidelity came close behind, and open profligacy, and bold insult, and cool, maddened outrage followed. How the ardent lover became the careless husband, the cold master, the unfeeling tyrant, and at last the brutal despot.” Marian came home to die—the seeds of that invincible disease were sown deep in her bosom; her exquisitely rounded shape was angular and thin, emaciated by disease, and suffering, and sorrow. A burning hectic spot on either cheek were now the only remnants of that once all-radiant complexion; her step so slow and falter ing, her breath drawn sob by sob with actual agony, her quick, short cough, all told too certainly the truth! Her faults were punished bitterly on earth, and happily that punishment had worked its fitting end —these faults were all repented, were all amended now. Perhaps at no time of her youthful bloom had Marian been so sweet, so truly lovely, as now when her young days were numbered. All the asperity and harshness, the angles as it were of her character, mellowed down into a calm and unrepining cheerfulness. And oh! with what delicious tenderness did Annabel console, and pray with, and caress her—oh! they were, indeed, happy! indeed happy for those last months, those lovely sisters. For Annabel's delight at seeing the dear Marian of happier and better days once more beside her, in their old chamber, beside her in the quiet garden, beside her in the pew of the old village church, had, for the time, completely overpowered her fears for her sister's health, and as is almost invariably the case in that most fatal, most insidious of disorders, she constantly was flattered with vain hopes that Marian was amending, that the next spring would see her again well and happy. Vain hopes! indeed vain hopes; but which of mortal hopes is other? The cold mists of November were on the hills and in the glens of Wharfdale; the trees were stripped of their last leaves, the grass was sere and withered, the earth cheerless, the skies comfortless, when, at the same predestined window, the sisters sat watching the last gleam of the wintry sun fade on the distant hill-top. What was that flash far up the road? That round and ringing report? Another! and another! the evident reports of musketry. And lo! a horseman flying—a wild fierce troop pursuing—the foremost rides bareheaded, but the blue scarf that flutters in the air, shows him a loyal cavalier; the steel caps and jack-boots of the pursuers, point them out, evidently, Puritans; there are but twenty of them, and lo! the fugitive gains on them—Heaven! he turns from the highroad! crosses the steep bridge at a gallop! he takes the park gate at a leap! he cuts across the turf! and lo! the dalesmen and the tenants have mustered to resist—a short, fierce struggle! the roundheads are beaten back! the fugitive, now at the very hall doors, is preserved. The door flew open; he staggered into the well-known vestibule, opened the parlor-door with an accustomed 4 hand, and reeled into the presence of the sisters exhausted with fatigue, pale from the loss of blood, faint with his mortal wounds—yet he spoke out, in a clearvoice, “In time, in time, thank God! in time to make some reparation, to ask for pardon, ere I die!” And with these words, De Vaux, for he it was, staggered up to his injured wife, and, dropping on his knees, cast his arms round her waist, and burying his head in her lap, exclaimed, in faltering tones, “Pardon me, Marian, pardon me, before I die; pardon me, as you loved me once!” “Oh! as I love you now, dear Ernest; fully, completely, gladly do I pardon you, and take you to my heart, never again to part, my own dear husband.” “Groaning, she clasped him close, and in that act And agony her happy spirit fled.” Annabel saw her head fall on his neck, and fancying that she had fainted, ran to uplift her; but, ere she had time to do so, both were beyond the reach of any mortal sorrow; nor did she, the survivor, long survive them; she faded like a fair flower, and lies beside them in the still bosom of one common tomb. The hall was tenanted no more, and soon fell into ruin; but the wild hills of Wharfdale must themselves pass away, before the children of the dalesman shall forget the sad tale of the Sisters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lord of the Manor CHAPTER I. It was the morning of the first of May, that merriest morning of the year, in the old days of merry England; and never did a brighter dawning illuminate a fairer landscape, than that wherein the incidents occurred, which form the basis of one of those true tales that prove how much there is of wild and strange romance even in the most domestic circles of existence. The landscape was a portion of the western slope of a broad English valley, diversified with meadow-land and pasture, and many a field of green luxuriant wheat, and shadowy woods, and bosky dells and dingles; and with a clear, bright, shallow river rippling along its pebbly channel, at the base of the soft hills, which swept down to its flowery marge in gentle loveliness. The foreground of the picture, for it was one indeed, on the left hand side, was made up of a thick mass of orchards, and beyond these by a clump of towering lindens, above which might be seen the arrowy spire of a village church, piercing the cool air with its gilded vane and weathercock—the river sweeping round and half enclosing the garden grounds, and cottages seen among the shrubbery, in a blue glancing reach spanned by a three-arched bridge of old red brick, all overrun with ivy. Close to the bridge, but on the west side of the stream, lay a large tract of open common, carpeted with rich short greensward, whereon a thousand fairy rings were visible, and sprinkled with all the bright wild flowers of the early spring. A winding road of yellow sand traversed the varied surface of the waste, which was much broken up by hillocks and deep hollows, alternating clear sunny lights with cool blue shadows; and, after crossing the river by the old bridge, was lost for a little while among the orchards of the village, till it again reappeared, near the centre of the middle distance, above the fringe of willow, birch, and alder bushes, which skirted all he eastern margin of the river. Beyond this screen of coppice, the view extended upward for nearly a mile in distance, over a beautiful park-like lawn, dotted with clumps of noble trees, and enclosed on every side by woods of tall dark oak. A large white gate gave access to this fair demesne, with a snug porter's lodge nestled into a shady covert close beside it; and at the very crown of the slope overlooking all the broad and fertile vale, stood a large mansion of red brick, built in the quaint architecture of the Elizabethan era. with large projecting oriels and tall clustered chimneys, and a wide freestone terrace, bedecked with urns and balustrades, in front; the dwelling evidently of the lord of that fair manor. To the right of the woods, which skirted that side of the park, lay an abrupt ravine, through which a brawling trout stream made its way down, among large blocks of limestone, and under tangled covert, to join the river in the valley. Beyond this gorge, the sides of which were feathered thick with yew, and box, and juniper, rose a broad barren hill, crowned by the grey and weather-beaten keep of an old Norman castle, frowning in dark sublimity over the cultured fields, whose fruits its lords of old had reaped, won by the mortal sword—and beyond this a range of purple moors towered, summit over summit, till they were lost at length in the grey mists of the horizon. It was, as has been said, the early dawning of the sweet first of May—so early that the sun had not yet reared the whole of his red dics above the eastern hills, but half emerged was checkering all the slopes and the level meadows at the bottom of the valley with lengthened streams of ruddy lustre, and casting long clear shadows from every tree or bush or stone that met his rays. Yet, early as it was, the village was alive with merriment and bustle. A joyous peal was chiming from the bells of the tall steeple, while a May-pole that almost vied in height with the neighboring spire, was planted on the common by the waterside, where the ground lay most level to the sunshine, and where the greensward grew the mossiest and softest to the tread. The whole waste land was covered with glad groups of peasautry, all in their holiday attire, speeding towards the rendezvous, beneath a huge gnarled hawthorn, which had beheld the sports of their grandsires, now white as if a sudden snow storm had powdered its dense foliage with the sweet blossoms that derive their name from the delicious month which witnesses their birth—the sandy road, too, and the bridge were glistening with moving parties; while the shrill merry laugh of girls, and the yet shriller whoop of childhood, came frequent on the ear from many a sequestered spot among the budding or chards—nor did the rugged castle hill display no joyous company; for there, and through the dim-wood glen and over the old turn-stile, and the park itself, the happy yeomanry came flocking to celebrate their feast of flowers. Just at this moment the parkgates were suddenly thrown open, and a young man rode out into the sandy road, accompanied by several dogs, and followed by three serving men—two mounted and the third on foot—and taking the downward track, to the left hand towards the village and the bridge, was quickly lost to view behind the willows on the river bank. As he appeared, however, even at that distance, both by his dress and air to be a person of superior rank to any of the groups around, and as I shall have much to do with him in the course of my narrative, I shall attach myself to him during his ride from the manor gates to the meadow of the May-pole. He was a young and extremely handsome person, well formed and tall, and giving promise of great future strength, when his slender and almost boyish frame should be developed to its full proportions; for he was, in years, all but a boy, having on that very morning attained to his majority, and the possession of the fine demesnes, and ample fortune, which now called him master. His hair was long and slightly curled, of a deep rich chestnut color; and notwithstanding it was the fashion of that day, even for the young and comely, to cover the whole head with a disfiguring mass of flowing powdered horse-hair, under the title of a periwig, he wore his locks all natural and undisguised; and well they harmonized with the fine coloring and noble outlines of his well marked frank features, sparkling as they were on that bright happy morning with gratified ambition, and high hope, and all the bounding energies of prosperous unbroken manhood. There were, it is true, some indications —which would not easily be missed by an experienced physiognomist—that told of strong and fiery passions concealed beneath that bold and beautiful exterior— there was a quick and hasty sparkle in the fine open eye, which indicated a temperament prone to blaze out, at any check to its desires, into fierce bursts of angry vehemence—there were deep lines for one so young about the mouth and nostrils, that clearly spoke of latent but indomitable pride; and something, too, of the existence of many a voluptuous feeling, ready to spring up giants from their birth, when any chance occurrence should kindle them to sudden life; still, in despite these drawbacks to his beauty, for such in truth they were, he could not fail to be pronounced, and that too in the highest sense of the term, a fine and noble looking man. He was dressed, too, in the rich fashion of the day, with a low crowned and broad brimmed beaver, decked by a hatband set about with short white ostrich feathers—his coat of grass green velvet, ornamented by a slight cord of gold, sat closely on his graceful form; while breeches of white doeskin, with heavy hunting boots and massive silver spurs, completed his attire; a light couteau de chasse hanging at his side, being carried rather as an indication of the wearer's rank, than us a weapon of defence; which, in the set led and peaceful state of England at that moment, was almost as unnecessary as at the present day. The dogs, which ran beside his stirrup, were six or eight in number, and noble specimens of several choice and favorite breeds. There was the tall lithe English bloodhound, with his sleek tawny hide, his pendulous ears, and coal black mnzzle; there were two fleet and graceful greyhounds, one white as snow, the other black as the raven's wing, with their elastic limbs and airy gait; there were a leash of King Charles's spaniels, beautiful silky creatures, with ears that swept the dew; and last, though not least in the owner's estimation, a savage-looking, wire-haired Scotch terrier, with shaggy jaws, and keen intelligent expression, though many a scar, of wounds inflicted in desperate encounters with the hill-fox or prowling wild-cat, seamed his rough grizzly face. The male attendants of the young gentleman were three, as I have said, in number; one a grey-headed, venerable-looking man, dressed in a suit of plain snnff-colored clothes, and mounted on a strong brown cob, which set off admirably, by the contrast, the fine points and superb condition of the splendid hunter which carried the young lord of the manor. This aged man, who was, indeed, the steward, who had lived on the property in the time of this youth's father, and to whose care and faithful management much of the present wealth of the estate might be attributed, rode not exactly abreast of his master, nor yet entirely behind him, but so that while preserving a respeetful distance, to show that he laid claim to no standing of equality, he was still near enough to maintain, without any inconvenience, whatever conversation it might please the younger man to originate. On the other side, among the dogs, which looked up to him from time to time with a very evident mixture of fear and affection in their features, strode along a well-built sturdy fellow of some eight-and-twenty or thirty years, standing some six feet in his stockings, and powerful in due proportion to his height. This man, who was dressed as a gamekeeper or forester, with leather buskins on his legs, and a short musquetoon or carabine in his hand, was what would be generally called good-looking, by those at least who, in the habit of regarding the mere animal qualities of humanity, neglect the nobler characteristics of intellectual beauty—for he was dark-haired and fresh complexioned, with a full bright eye and prominent features. There was a strong resemblance, moreover, in all his lineaments to the calm and serene face of the old steward; but it was in the outlines only, and, even of these, one of the most remarkable in the father was wholly wanting to the son—for such, indeed, was their relationship— namely, the ample and majestic forehead; which striking feature was changed in the younger man for a low and receding brow, giving a mean and vulgar expression to the whole countenance, which was, moreover, of a dogged and sullen cast, with large thick sensual lips, heavy and massive jaws, and all the animal portions of the head unusually and ungracefully developed. This unprepossessing face, for such indeed it was, gloomy and lowering, unless when it was lighted up by a smile even more inauspicious than the darkness it relieved, flashed out at times under that brief illumination with a shrewd gleam, half cunning, half malignant, which rendered it, for the moment, almost fearful to behold. The third person was an ordinary groom, in a blue coat, with a livery badge on his farm, carrying pistols at his holsters, and a heavy hunting whip in his right hand. Such was the little party which rode down from the manor gate towards the village-green, on that May morning, amidst the loud and hearty congratulations of every rustic group they passed on their way—the honest heart of every jolly yeoman expanding, as he welcomed to his new possessions the young man, who had dwelt among them when a gay and thoughtless boy, and won affections which had still remained unchanged throughout his absence from the home of his fathers, during his education at school and college, or, in vacation time, at the distant mansions of his guardians. It did not take the horsement long, although the heir pansed several times for a moment or two to converse cheerily with some of the older farmers, whom he remembered to have been kind to him when a child, or with some of the stalwart striplings with whom he had fished, or birdnested, or ferreted wild rabbits, as companions in the blithe days of boyhood —it did not take the horsemen long to thread the windings of the sandy road, to cross the old brick bridge, and reach the beautiful green meadow, where the tall May-pole stood, as it had stood for ages, surrounded by a merry concourse, engaged in decking it with clusters of the flowery hawthorn, and garlands of a thousand dewy blossoms. While one bold boy, who had elimbed to the summit of the dizzy mast, was hoisting up a hollow globe composed of many intersecting hoops, all bound with wreaths of eglantine and hawthorn and wild roses, with flaunting streamers and bright ribbons of every hue under the sun, to crown the flower-girt fabric, another group was busied, as the horsemen wheeled from the high road into the wide velvet green, in piling up a rustic throne beneath the aged hawthorn, composed of turf bedecked with crocuses and violets, and the sweet cuckoo buds, and briony, and bright marsh marigolds from the stream's berge, and water-lilies from its stiller reaches, and buttercups and daisies from the meadows. All ceased, however, instantly from their slight labors as the young gentleman rode forward at a slow pace, his progress actually hindered by the progress of the people crowding up to greet their honored landlord; and a lond ringing shout, echoed back many times by each projecting hill through the long valley, spoke, and for once sincerely, more of heart-love than of lip-loyalty. A brilliant flush of pleasure suffused his cheeks, and his eyes sparkled with excitement, as he doffed his plumed hat and bowed repeatedly to his assembled tenantry. He said, however, nothing in reply to their tumultuous cheering, until the old steward, pricking his cob gently with the spur, rode up unbidden to his master's side, and whispered in his ear— “Speak to them—speak to them, Sir Edward—for they expect it; and will set it down to pride, it may be, if you do not. Speak to them, if it be only twenty words.” “Not I, faith!” said the young heir, laughing; “I should stop short for very bashfulness before I had got ten words out, let alone twenty. But tell them, good Adam”— “No! no! Sir Edward”—the old man interrnpted him, “you must, so please you, be guided for this once by your old servant; your father was a favorite with them always; and so were you, God bless you! while you were but a little boy; and, take my word for it, you shall gain more of good will, and of general favor by speaking to them frankly for five minutes, than by distributing five hundred pounds.” “Well, if it must be so, old Adam, I suppose it must,” returned the other, “but by my honor, I had rather scatter the five hundred pounds you talk about, among them.” Then drawing himself up in his saddle without a moment's thought or preparation, he once more doffed his hat, and addressed himself in clear and well enunciated words, although his tones at first were somewhat low, and his manner flurried, to the yeomanry, who stood around in silent and attentive admiration. As he went on, however, and gradually became accustomed to the sound of his own voice, that voice grew stronger, clearer, more sonorous, and his air less embarrassed, till at length, before he had been speaking quite five minutes, his notes were even and sustained, flowing into the ear like a continued strain of silvery music. “I thank you, my good friends,” he said, “I thank you, from the bottom of my soul, for this, your frank and warm-hearted reception, and, when I say I thank you, I would not have you fancy that I am using a mere word, an empty form of speech, filling the ear indeed, signifying nothing. No, my good friends and neighbors, when I say here, I thank you, I mean in truth that my heart is full of gratitude towards you, and that it is my full and resolute intention, to prove that gratitude by my deeds to be done among you. I am a very young man yet, as you all know—and, of the few years which have hitherto been mine, the most have been passed at a distance from you. Many of you, whom I see round about, remember well my birth and boyhood; as I remember many whom I look upon for their frank, manly kindness towards a wayward schoolboy; but as I said even now, I have hitherto lived afar from you, and you know nothing of my heart or habits; and therefore, though I feel that your welcome is sincere, your congratulations honest, I am not such a fool of vanity, as to suppose all this aflection and respectful greeting to be won from you by any merits of ray own. Oh! no, my friends, I know it is the legacy, the precious legacy of your esteem and love! left to me by the virtues of a father, a grandfather, a race who have lived here in the midst of you, for ages, doing good, and receiving ample payment in looking on a free, a prosperous, and a grateful people. My heart then would be dull, indeed, and senseless, if I did not appreciate the richest legacy of all, which they have left me, in your hereditary love—my mind must be brutish and irrational, if, in perceiving and appreciating this, I did not perceive also, how I must merit your affection— how I must make it my own absolute possession, even as it was my father's—how I must leave it to my children, after me— if it please God in his wisdom through me to continue our line. My friends, I do perceive it! I have come hither to-day, to live among you, as my fathers did—to be no more your landlord than your friend, your neighbor, your protector. I will not draw my revennes from the country, to layish them on the idlers of the town! No! my friends, where my father's life was passed, there I will pass mine, likewise; and when the time allotted here to us shall be measured to its end, I trust thet I shall lay my bones beside his bones in your quiet churchyard! Now, mark what I would say, for I must not be tedious; I promise you that no man's rent shall be screwed up by me, beyond his own ability to psy, so he be sober, industrious, and frugal! I promise you that no new tenant shall be preferred before an old one, so long as he deal with me justly. I promise you, that no strong man shall want good work, and ready payment—no sick man medicine and succor—no old man aid and comfort—no poor man whatsoever help his exigencies need, that I can give to him, so long as God continue me among you. This, then, I promise you, not as a boon or bounty, but as I hold it here to be my bounden duty—and this will I make good to you, so surely as my name is Edward Hale of Arrington! Now I will trouble you no more, except to pray you to continue your sports, as if I were not present; and to request you all to dine with me at noon, on good old English beef and pudding. My fellows will be down anon, to pitch some tents here on the green, and set the ale a-flowing—and so once more I thank you.” It is probable that no set oration, delivered by the mightiest of the world's rhetoricians, bedecked with all the gor geous ornaments that genins can produce from its immortal garners, was ever listened to with more profound and rapt attention, than the few simple words, which flowed as it appeared so naturally from the heart to the tongue of the young landlord. It is certain, that none ever sank more deeply into the feelings of the audience—their better, holier feelings! There was no violent outburst of pleasure—no loud tumultnous cheering—but a deep hush—a breathing silence! Many of the old men, and all the women, were in tears; and when they spoke, at length, it was with husky interrupted voices that they invoked Heaven's blessings on his head; and when they thought, it was with gratitude for their own happy lot in owning such a master. Sir Edward was himself affected, partly it might be from the excitement of delivering a first speech, and that with success so apparent and complete—it might be from the geauine warmth of his own heart, and strength of his own feelings; for the hearts of the young are almost ever warm, whether for good or for evil, and their emotions powerful and abundant; and oftentimes it happens, that the mere speaking forcibly of feelings, which perhaps at the time exist but faintly—and as I might say speculatively—will give those feelings actual force, and cause them to develope themselves with new and unsuspected vigor. And so it surely was with Edward Hale, in this case. He was, as we have seen, extremely young—not in years only, but in knowledge of the world—and volatile, and hasty, and impetnous—too much, indeed, a creature and a child of impulse—I say not that his impulses were evil—I believe not that the impulses of the very young are so, except in rare and almost monstrous instances; but they were impulses, ungoverned, uncontrolled by any principle, any set rule of action, any guide of religion—and, therefore, even when most originally good, they were liable to be pushed into excesses; to be deceptive; to be self-deceivers; to degenerate into downright vices. That Edward Hale had thought at times of the condition of his subordinate fellows, is most true—that he had often dreamed bright day-dreams concerning the happiness of a half patriarchal life among his tenants, is undoubted; and that his tastes, his habits, his pursuits, all led him to prefer a country to a city residence, no less so. So it is true, that being liberal as the wind—nay, almost lavish—charity, so far at least as charity consists in giving, was an accustomed and familiar pleasure; that, like all men of glowing and enthusiastic minds, he was by no means without some crude and undigested notions of a wild species of Utopian justice! that he was of too bold and fiery a temperament not to abhor and loathe the very name of fraud or falsehood—and more, to do him simple justice, too kindly-hearted to be cruel, or systematically overbearing and oppressive. Still, it is no less certain that until that very morning—nay, until the very minute when accident called on him to deliver an impromptu speech, when the excitability of his emotions, and his gratification at his warm reception by his tenants set loose the flood-gates of his fancy and his heart—for in this instance, both were acted on, and both reacted in connexion—he had never thought consecutively for half an hour on the subject; never had laid out for himself any rule or principle at all; never had, indeed, considered that he owed any duties to his fellow men. “What then,” I fancy I can hear the reader say, “What then, was Edward Hale a hypocrite? Was all his fine, apparently free-hearted speech a piece of absolute deception” Neither, dear reader, neither; the young are rarely, oh! very rarely, hypocrites; rarely deceivers even, nuless it be from fear, in timid dispositions, of some contingent evils, which they imagine they can shum by falsehood. And Edward Hale was neither; scarce even a deceiver of himself. He had returned, only the previous night, to the home of his happy boyhood, after years of absence; had looked upon the picture of a mother, whom he almost adored; had trodden the floors, along which he had bounded years ago; how changed and yet the same; and everything he saw, and heard, and thought of, conspired to call up his better feelings, and to attune his spirit to a mood more reflective—nay, almost melancholy—than his wont. A passionate lover of the charms of nature, he had felt, while he gazed out from his window over the lovely landscape, while he rode in all the consciousness of power and health, on his splendid hunter, beneath his ancestral trees, he had felt, I say, that he could never love a spot on earth so well as his own fair demesnes; that he could never live so happily or with so calm a dignity in any other place, as he could here among his people. Theu, when he found himself quite unexpectedly the object of affection so enthusiastic, of greetings so sincere and earnest, his fancy pictured to him in a moment, the pure and exquisite delights of such a life as he described in his brief speech; his heart yearned to the kind and humble yeomanry, whose very souls, apparently, were overflowing with love to all his race. He spoke embarrassed at the first, and faltering and undecided; but, as he warmed to his task, his rich imagination woke; image suggested image, and though perhaps, he actually thought, now for the first time of many of the things he stated, they glowed so vividly before the eyes of his mind, that he believed them for the moment to be old and familiar ideas—the well remembered consequences of past reasoning. He believed from the bottom of his heart, that every word he uttered was strictly and indisputably true; not for his life would he have uttered one, had he not so believed! And when he ceased to speak, he was affected by the very ideas that his own lively fancy had, for the first time, set before him; and he could safely then have registered a vow in heaven that such had always been his view of his own duties; and that so he would surely act, as long as he lived to act on earth at all. As he ceased speaking, he turned his horse half round, as if to leave the green, saying to a fine hearty-looking yeoman who stood nearest to him, one of the patriarchs, unquestionably, of the place. “I must ride, Master Marvel, to Stowcum-Barnesley, to meet some college friends of mine, who promised to come down and spend my birth-day with me; but it is early yet, you know, and Oliver here.” patting as he spoke the proud neck of his horse, “makes nothing of fifteen miles an hour; so I can ride thither easily, and he back with my friends to dinner.” “Aye, that thou canst, Sir Edward,” returned the old man, laughing cheerily— “Aye, that thou canst; so go thy ways, go thy ways, and God speed thee!” Edward Hale touched his horse lightly with the spur, that he made one quick bound forward; but as he did so, the rider turned half round in his saddle, for something caught his attention so keenly that his eye sparkled, and his cheek flushed suddenly. The consequence was, that he checked Oliver so sharply with the curb, although involuntarily, that he reared bolt upright, and by the suddenness of the movement, so nearly unseated his master, that his hold on the saddle depended for a moment on the rein, and consequently the strain was increased greatly on the bit. The hunter stood erect, pawing the air with his fore-feet, as if in an effort to retrieve his balance. Every one thought he must have fallen backward, crushing his rider in the fall, and a shrill female shriek rang piercingly into the air; but, active, young, and fearless, Sir Edward scarce perceived the error he had committed before he repaired it. Throwing himself forward in his stirrups, by a rapid and elastic spring, he wreathed his fore-finger lightly in the mane, and gave the horse the spur so sharply that he made a violent plunge forward and alighted on his fore-feet with a dint that threw the turf into the air, in fifty several fragments, but failed to move the horseman in his saddle in the slightest degree. Then the hot temper of the young man rose; and though a moment's thought would have shown him that the horse was in no respect to blame, he checked him again almost fiercely with the heavy curb, and spurred him till the blood spirted from his sides, under the galling rowels. Stung by the treatment, the noble beast yerked out his heels, and fell into a quick succession of balotades, croupades, and caprioles, and furious plunges, such as must have inevitably cast headlong to the earth a less accomplished cavalier than he who backed him now. Firm as a rock in his demique sat Edward Hale, as though he had been a portion of the animal which he bestrode; but maddened by the resistance offered to his first momentary action of injustice, he plied both lash and spur with almost savage impetuosity, yet with so rare a skill, that in five minutes' space, or even less, the brown horse stood stock still, panting, and humbled, and subdued. He gazed around him for a moment, with a triumphant and defying glance; and without again looking in the direction of the object, whatsoever it was, that had before attracted his attention, he bade his mounted groom give up his horse to the game-keeper, and stay himself to wait on master Adam Eversley. The change was accomplished in a minute; and, without any further words, he dashed into a gallop, and was speedily lost to view beyond the summit of the hills, which bounded the valley to the westward. “Oh! father,” cried a beautiful country girl, who was leaning on the arm of an old grey-headed farmer, “Oh, father, father, how beautifully young Sir Edward spoke, and what a kind speech that was, and then how well he sat on that vicious horse of his, and how quickly he did master him. He is the handsomest gentleman, I think, in all the country; and the best-hearted too, I'll warrant him.” “And yet, Rose,” answered a young stalwart yeoman, who had been standing close beside her, leaning on a long twohauded quarter staff, “and yet Rose, it was all of his own fault, that the poor horse was vicions; and then see how he dealt with the dumb beast for his own failing. He is a handsome man, that's true, as ever an eye looked upon; but did you see the way his black brows met together; how the passion flashed out, almost like lightning, under them; and how he bit his lips till the blood came? Be sure, now, he has a fearful temper. Why he looked liker to a handsome devil, than to a Christian man! I would be loth to stand against him, in aught he had set his heart on.” “For shame—for shame to thee, Frank Hunter,” cried the girl he had addressed as Rose—“For shame on thee, to speak so of the young winsome gentleman. I hate an envious spirit; and he so kind, too, and so gentle—didst not hear what he promised—how no poor man should ever want for anything; and how no sick man should need doctoring, so long as his name was Edward Hale—and then to liken him to a devil! I'm sure, I think he looked like an angel, and spoke like an angel, too, just come down to us out of heaven!” “Have a care, Rose,” returned the other, gloomily, “have a care, lest he lure thee to somewhat that will not lead thee up there; whether he came down out of heaven or no. I reckon it 'was all along o' looking at those brown curls and hazel eyes o' thine, that he came so near falling from his saddle.” “Why, here's a nice to do,” answered the girl, very sharply, “and what an' he was looking at my curls, or my eyes either; what is that, master Hunter, to thee, I'd be pleased to know—or who gave thee the right to say who shall look at me: or whom I shall look at either, for that matter? You are no kin of mine—much less a master.” “Oh, Rose! Rose! can it be come to this, between us—and we troth-plighted, too!' “Aye has it,” answered Rose, tossing her pretty head, “aye, has it come to this —and better now than later!—better troth-plighted, and rue the plighting! than wed and rue the wedding!—better an envious sweetheart and a jealous, than a hard tyrannizing husband! Aye, has it come to this, and thou must mend thy manners, ere aught else come of it, I tell thee.” Her father tried to interpose; but the village beauty was quite too indignant to be appeased so readily; and she left his arm instantly, turning her back without ceremony on her luckless swain, saying that she must go and join Susan Fairly, for all the girls were seeking her. So little does it need to raise a quarrel between those who truly and sincerely love each other especially in quick and ardent dispositions. CHAPTER II. It often happens that, in places far removed each from the other, events are occurring to different individuals, almost at the same moment, which are destined to produce the most serious results to other persons, who are equally ignorant of the present action, and unsuspicious of the future consequence. So intricately and inextricably blended are the threads of mortal life, and so wonderfully linked are those chains of cause and effect, in which even unborn generations are not unfrequently involved, by that vast and all comprehensive Providence which mortals in their blindness are wont to call chance. Especially was this the case with Sir Edward Hale, at the present moment of my tale; though he would have laughed very heartily had any one told him that the whole happiness of his future life was brought into jeopardy, while he was thinking only of the pleasures of the hour, by the intrigues of men in London, some of whom he had never seen, and scarcely even heard of; yet such unquestionably was the case. It was about seven o'clock on the same morning that a plain dark carriage, containing a tall, thin, grave looking gentleman, with a peculiarly sardonic smile, drove rapidly from the door of the Secretary of State, at whose house an extraordinary cabinet council had been just held, through Charing Cross, where the magnificent statue of King Charles the First, by Hubert le Sœur, had resumed its position, and passed the stately front of Northumberland House, towards Spring Gardens. Here it paused, before the portico of a stately mansion; and the footman springing down from the board behind the chariot, notwithstanding the earliness of the hour, raised such a noisy snmmons as soon brought a servant to the door, when the name of the untimely visitor procured his admittance without delay, although the man appeared somewhat reluctant—saying that the Earl was not yet awake, and had left word that he should not be disturbed, as it was very late when he retired. “I know it, my good friend,” replied the visitor—“I know that it was very late; but it was later by two hours before I was abed, and I have been up, I assure you, since four o'clock this morning. But, leaving this aside, which is no matter, I will be your security that you will do no wrong in awakening my lord, seeing that I have news for him about which he is very anxious; and it is, moreover, on business of his majesty that I must see him.” This, of course, put an end, on the instant, to all discussion or remonstrance on the subject, the man showing him immediately into a handsome library, containing several thousand volumes, and decorated with many busts, and two or three fine antique statues. Begging the visitor, with whom he appeared to be well acquainted, to take a seat while he apprised the Earl of his arrival, he then withdrew, but returned in a few minutes, saying, “My lord, Sir Henry, will be down in a quarter of an hour, at the furthest, and begs that you will wait for him. He desired me to ask if you would take some chocolate, Sir Henry!” “Yes, bring me some, Anderson, if it be ready; and, hark ye, tell my fellows to go home with the chariot; I will walk, when I go hence.” As soon as the man had left the room, the other arose from his chair and walked towards one of the tall book-cases, as if to seek a volume wherewith to while away the time; but, after he had opened the glass doors, and suffered his eyes to run over a shelf or two, he either changed his mind or fell into a different train of thought, and forgot it; for he turned round abruptly, and walked across the room with his hands clasped behind his back. “It must be done! it must,” he muttered to himself; “we must have his vote, or the whole thing is at an end, and we may just as well give up the campaign at once! But this will do it; I think, I dare swear it will! and, if not—if not—we must give him more; though, hang me! if I know what there is that we can give him that he is fit for! The garter! aye, the garter—a rare successor he to the great champions of the order!” And he smiled, with the bitter, sneering, caustic expression that has been mentioned as peculiar to him. At this moment the servant returned, bearing a silver salver, with a tall chocolate pot of the same metal, richly embossed, and a couple of superb French-china cups. Scarcely, however, had he frothed and poured out the rich beverage, which had but lately been introduced into England, and was still a rarity, before his master entered the library, in some small agitation, as it seemed, and perhaps even anxiety. He was a tall and powerfully made man, of some fifty-seven or fifty-eight years, with features that would have been positively handsome had there been a solitary gleam of intelligence—a single trace expressing anything of character in their symmerrical outlines and harmonioas coloring. He was magnificently, though not completely, attired in the costume of the day; wearing a dressing gown of splendid brocade in place of the embroidered coat, and a cap of green velvet, with a gold band and tassel, in lien of the huge periwig, which was then an essential part of a gentleman's full dress. “Give you good day, Sir Henry,” he said as he entered, with a bland smile upon his face, which did not, however, conceal a nervousness of manner that told something of eager and fretful expectation. “You come so early that, as you see, I make no ceremony with you; I have not even tarried to finish dressing, as I presumed you were in a hurry.” “I thank you much, my lord,” returned the other, sipping his chocolate, “both for what you have done, and what you have left undone; for, indeed, I have something to say to you of moment.” Then, seeing that he did not take the hint, as he expected he would do, and dismiss the valet, who stood with both his ears wide open, ready to drink in every word, he said carelessly, “Excellent chocolate, this, my lord, but I do not think it has ever paid any duty.” “No, no! not it, not it! Sir Henry,” answered the penderous earl, making precisely the reply for which his guest was looking. “I had it in a present from my good friend the French Ambassador.” “Ah! ah!” answered Sir Henry Davenant, as if thoughtfully, “and upropos of French, had you Anderson, here, with you when you were at Paris last?” “No; he came to me after my return,” said the obtuse earl, not yet perceiving that the drift of Sir Henry's question was to call his attention to the presence of the man. After a few minutes, however, during which he appeared to ruminate very sagely, he lifted up his head with what he intended for a very knowing smile, and told his valet that he need not wait. “Very deep of you—very deep, that, Sir Henry. Almost too deep! for, drown me for a witch if I caught your meaning at first!” “But why in Heaven's name, my dear lord, do you keep such a long-eared knave as that about you? Why, curiosity is written as plainly as the name of a book on its title-page, in every feature of his face; the very owning such a fellow is enough almost to destroy one's reputation for diplomacy. It is true that the Earl of Asterly has less need to regard such things than we beginners; but, nevertheless, even with your finesse, I would hardly desire to risk it!” “Ha! ha! you are flattering me—you are flattering me, I am afraid, Sir Henry; though you have not very much the character of saying pretty things, even to the ladies, bless their souls!” And, while he spoke, it was as evident as the sun in heaven, that he had swallowed the dose, palpable as it was, without wincing, or suspecting that it was, even as he said, a mixture of the grossest adulation with the most barefaced ridicule “But, come,” he added, after another pause of hesitation, “unbuckle your budget, my good sir; what can you possibly have to say to me so early this morning?” “Why, the fact is, my lord,” answered Davenant, who filled at that time the very useful post, in reference to the then ministry, which is now known as that of Whipper-in to the House of Commons, “that, as I told you would be the case, when I had the honor of speaking with you last night, there has been a meeting of the cabinet at Mr. Secretary's house, this morning.” And the wily baronet paused at this piece of information, partly to give his heavy auditor time to take in its whole meaning, and partly because he wished to see exactly what was the amount of his dupe's anxiety on the subject. “Indeed, indeed?” the earl replied, in the tone of one inquiring further; “you are well informed always, Sir Henry; and what then? What was the result of their conference, my dear sir?—that is to say, if it may be spoken.” “Oh, yes, my lord, it may be spoken. If that were not the case, you would not have seen me here this morning, for my object in coming was purely to give you the information; which I have leave to do from Mr. Secretary, and a message from him, likewise, that is to say, if the government may rely, as they presume they can, on the continued support of the Earl of Asterly. If not, why, I must keep my budget closed; which I should be the more sorry to do, because, if opened, it contains news that I think would give you pleasure.” “Oh! yes, Sir Henry,” replied the peer, immediately. “His majesty's government may certainly count on my support in all matters consistent with the Protest—” But before he could get out the whole word and commit himself to any measure, Davenant interrupted him. “Oh! my dear lord, of course, the cabinet will not attempt to carry any measure out, which shall not have received, previously, your distinguished approbation. But your lordship is too good a politician, not to feel that no ministry would be justified in submitting a plan of its campaign, and perhaps offering honors, to any gentleman or nobleman, how sure soever they might feel of his support, without something more definite, in the shape of a pledge—” “Ah!” said the earl, affecting to ponder on what he had heard, but in reality endeavoring to outwit the keen clear-sighted diplomatist, who could read every thought in his bosom, almost before it was formed. “Ah! that makes all the difference!—” “That is to say,” thought Davenant in his own heart, “the hope of office, or additional rank, makes all the difference. Showing your hand, rather too openly, my good lord!” “That makes all the difference, Sir Henry,” he resumed, “for, as you say, the fact of the ministry being desirous of consulting me on their measures, or indeed of their asking for my support at all, is as I think a sufficient guarantee of their intentions. For it is evident that they could not imagine it possible that I should lend my countenance to measures—” “Of which your lordship's well known capacity and foresight should not induce you cordially to approve. You take the same views of the matter which I do myself, my lord. The noble lords, now at the head of his majesty's government, doubtless would not expect anything incompatible with Lord Asterly's known character for political consistency and personal integrity. Nevertheless, it is their resolution in the present unsettled state of parties, and I think your lordship will admit it to be a necessary and a wise one, to associate no person, however great his merits, with themselves, unless it be upon an unconditional pledge.” “Well, sir, I cannot blame them, upon my word, Sir Henry, I cannot. For there is now-a-days so much political tergiversation, even in the highest quarters, that no one can be absolutely above suspicion!”—and, at the very moment he said this, despite all his dullness, he clearly understood what was expected of him; and, having fully made up his mind to desert his party for a consideration, was only now endeavoring to conceal his pre meditated baseness from Sir Henry; which he had about as much chance of doing, as the ostrich, when it buries its hend in the sand of the desert, has of keeping its body hidden from the lynx-eyed Arabian hunter. “Then I am to understand, my lord, that you do not object to give such a pledge to the Secretary—a written pledge, my lord?” “Why—no—no!” said Lord Asterly, in a sort of half-doubtful tone, “not absolutely—no! I should not absolutely object—but I should like to know something a little more definite about the nature of the measures!” “Well, then, my lord,” returned Sir Henry Davenant,” since your lordship is so scrupulous, for which I confess I honor you so much the more, I will venture to give you a few hints. In the first place, the captured French colonies will not be given up under any circumstances!” This piece of information, by the way, was the more valuable, because it was the first any one had ever received concerning the question of their cession; which had never once been mooted. But notwithstanding this, the earl expressed his grave satisfaction at the firmness of the noble lords. “In the next place, his grace of B— will have the vice-royalty of Ireland. The earl of F— goes as ambassador to France, and your humble servant, I believe, to the Hague—but that is not quite certain yet!”—the other two appointments having been known to all the quidnuncs of the town for a week past, the earl learned little by this last sentence, and that little, utterly of no account; but he replied— “Excellent—excellent—Sir Henry, no better men for the offices, than they. I will say that it does honor to Mr. Secretary's discernment. For I presume he had a word to say in the appointments.” “Surely, my lord, surely. His word, I may say, is almost omnipotent with their lordships; and that, I fancy, is one reason why he is so desirous of attaching you, my lord, with some others of his friends, to the party; while he is himself in power.” The Earl of Asterly noted and treasured up the words, but pretending not to have given them much attention, he added— “But have you nothing more to tell me?” “Faith! very little more, my lord, there will be several new additions to the peerage—two or three ancient titles to be raised to a higher grade; and then, there are, you know, the two vacant garters— But upon my life!” he added, breaking off suddenly, “this is scarce fair of your lordship; here, you have pumped me of almost all my secrets, and given me nothing satisfactory after all. But I trust your lordship will deal kindly with me, this would go far to ruin me with the great man, if it got wind.” “Why! ha! ha!” responded the earl, langhing very knowingly, “I think I have been a little hard on you, Sir Henry, a little too hard—I believe! But, ha! ha! ha! you young fellows ought not to fancy that you can hood-wink us old boys!— well—well—well!—but, as you say, I must make it up with you. See here, I will write a word or two; pray you, excuse me.” Could the dull nobleman have marked the cold, calm, cutting smile, ineffably contemptuous and full of loathing, with which the politician surveyed him, while he penned his memorandum, well cased as he was in complete panoply of self-conceit, and gross, complacent stolidity, he must have been cut to the quick; but he did not raise his head till he had finished writing, and when he did so, Davenant's eyes were fixed on the ground in quiet and apparently conscious humility. The earl pushed the sheet of paper, on which he had written a few lines with his signature appended to them, across the table to Sir Henry, saying— “There, my good friend; see if that will meet Mr. Secretary's views!” It was a full and formal promise to support, with all his personal and political influence, the present cabinet in all its measures whatsoever. “I presume,” he added, “that of course it will not be shown.” “Of course not, my lord,” Sir Henry answered, as he took it; and then, after casting his eyes slightly over the document, “Perfectly—perfectly satisfactory,” he added; “nothing can be more honorable, open, or above board. And now, my lord, allow me to congratulate you—” “To congratulate me, Sir Henry! upon what?” said Lord Asterly, with a pleasant and conscious smile, which be endeavored vainly to dissemble. “There is a dormant marquisate in your lordship's family, I believe. Beverley, is it not? which your lordship claimed from the last ministry.” “And was refused!” replied the earl, hanghtily, “owing to the opposition, I think, of my Lord Calverly, who lays claim to it likewise, though he has no more plea of right, than he has to the dukedom of Northumberland! I never cared much about it myself, Sir Henry; but it was an old hobby of my father's; and in respect to his memory, it was, that I revived the claim.” “And gross injustice was done to you in the refusal. Well, my lord, in consideration of this, his majesty has been pleased of his own accord, quite unsolicited, to creare you Marquis of Beverley, and I am happy to be the first person to salute you by the ancient title of your family.” “Indeed! Sir Henry, indeed!” exclaimed the new marquis, exceedingly gratified; “this is indeed very flattering. His majesty is very gracious—the rather, as you say, that it is quite unsolicited; and that no one can say that it is a reward of any party services!” Old hand as he was at intrigue, and an adept at concealing every emotion, Davenant could hardly refrain from laughing aloud at the impudent self-complacency of this speech, when he thought of the precious document which he had just pocketed; but he did refrain, and answered quietly, and as a matter of course. “Yes! marquis, it must be very gratifying. But now et us speak of business. The Irish Bill, comes on, you know next Tuesday se'nnight, and by it the ministry have determined that they will stand or fall.” “The Irish Bill! indeed! the Irish Bill!” said the marquis, as he must now be called, “I did not look for that! you should have told me of that, Sir Henry.” “Why, marquis,” answered Davenant, as if surprised, “I took it for granted that you must see that. It followed as a natural consequence, from his Grace's nomination to the vice-royalty.” “And so it did—and so it did—upon my word!” replied the other, quite as much relieved by the futile explanation, as if it were a satisfactory excuse for his adopting the measures to-day, which yesterday he had repudiated; “I never thought of that before.” “I felt quite certain that you would view it in that light, when you came to reflect,” answered Davenant. “Certainly—certainly—I could not do otherwise,” said the marquis; “but what was it you said about the garter? who did you say were to succeed to the two vacant stalls?” “I did not say, marquis, for I don't know; and I don't know, simply because it has not yet been determined by their lordships.” “Not yet determined! Is not that very strange? a matter, tob, of so great and paramount importance.” “Doubtless there are strong reasons for delay, marquis. In the first place, notwithstanding the accession of strength to the government from the complete over-throw of the Duke of Monmouth's people at Sedgemoor, and the final close of all that infamous affair, you are aware that there is still a very strong opposition— and on this Irish question—by the way, how many votes do you carry with you, marquis?” “Five in the Lower House, and in the Peers, my son-in-law Helvelyn's, in addition to my own.” “Oh! in the Peers we are safe enough; but, to be frank with you, marquis, there is a good deal to fear in the Commons—at the best, we can only count a tie, reckoning all your votes—and, I fancy, though I do not know it for certain, that any one who could bring over one or two votes so as to make sure of a majority, might reckon pretsy certainly on the garter.” “Aye! aye!” responded the marquis, falling into a deep fit of cogitation, from which he presently aroused himself to inquire who were the members that remained at all doubtful. “Why, by my honor!” answered Davenant, “there are but three whom we dare even to count doubtful—and they are at the present dead against us—the only reason why I call them doubtful, is that they are against us from whim only, or what they call principle, and not from any pledge, or any great interest that they have in the matter.” “And who are they?” “First of all, Captain Trevor—” “Why don't you give him a regiment?” “It would not do—he is not at all that sort of man—besides, it is hardly worth the while to try him; he has a grudge of some kind, I believe, against Berkley, and we may set him down against us without more ado. The next is Frampton of Frampton, and as there is not a newly imported Arab stallion, or an invincible gamecock of extraordinary lineage, to be got for love or money in the kingdom, we have no means of bribing him. As for offering him rank, that is useless to a man who thinks that to be Frampton of Frampton is a far finer thing than to be premier peer of England, if we could make him that, which we can't. Money—worse yet, to a fellow who complains that he cannot for his life get through a third of his rent roll; though I believe he feeds half the East Riding with beef and beer the year round. Ashley did speak of sending to the Dey of Algiers for a barh; but there is not time enough. So he is a lost vote, too! The third and last is Lord Henry St. Maur.” “Ah! St. Maur—St. Maur! is he inclined against you?” “Not inclined merely. He has declared himself opposed to all our measures; and he is too young, too full of generous and high fantasies to be approachable.” “And yet I think I could approach him on the subject,” said the marquis. “You, my lord, you! Impossible!” cried Davenant, the whole aim and object of whose mission was simply to procure the influence of his man on young St. Maur. “Impossible! we were not aware even that you knew him.” “I do, but very slightly,” answered Beverley; “and yet I think he can he won. Nay! I almost think I can promise you his vote. Do you know where he is, Sir Henry?” “By accident, I do; for I called at his father's yesterday. He is on a visit to some young country bumpkin of a baronet or other, at Arrington, in Hampshire—the post town is Stow-cum-Barnesley.” “Indeed, at Sir Edward Hale's—is he?” “Hale—Hale! By George! I believe Hale was the name. Upon my word, marquis, you seem to know all the world.” “My place is near Oxford, you know, Sir Henry, and this young fellow was at Christ Church, with my son, who brought him to Asterley last year in the long vacation. But he is not at all a bumpkin.” “I dare say not, indeed—for I know nothing about it—only Fred Jermyn, of the Life Guards, was laughing at him for a quiz the other night, at the Nag's Head,” replied Davenant, who never said a word without its object, and who had now his own peculiar reason for doing the young baronet an ill office with the marquis. “I will write to St. Maur to-day,” said the marquis, after a moment's thought, “I am nearly sure that I can secure you his vote.” “I do not think it is possible,” said Davenant, knowing all the time that it was pretty certain, if the old peer only chose to exert himself on the right track. “It would require immense influence—immense influence!” “I flatter myself I have a good deal of influence over him,” answered the marquis, knowingly. “I thought you said, but now, that you only knew him slightly?” “I do only know him slightly.” “Then how, in the devil's name,” Sir Henry began, with well feigned astonishment, when the peer interrupted him— “Ask me no questions—it is a secret— but I tell you, that Mr. Secretary may make himself tolerably easy on the matter. I will write to him this very day, and I shall have an answer by to-morrow night, for I will send one of my fellows post.” “You are an extraordinary man, marquis; but, if you accomplish this, I shall set you down as a second Mazarin. Well! well! you are a fortunate man, too; for I see that you will be the wearer of this garter, which his grace of Lauderdale, they say, is looking after.” “Fie! fie! Sir Henry—fie! Do you suppose that a thought of that kind ever occurred to me? Oh no—fie! fie! but, on my word, I believe I can do it.” “I trust that you may not be disappointed. But, in the meantime, I will take my leave; for I can hear the marchioness', and the pretty Lady Fanny's voices in the breakfast parlor. Besides which, I must make haste with this good news to master Secretary.” Then, with the courtly ceremonial of the day, he took his leave; but as he crossed the threshold, he muttered to himself— “Cursed old hypocrite and knave! and idiot, worse than either, for daring to imagine that he could hoodwink me. Well! never mind, St. Maur will get Lady Fan's pretty hand, and we shall get his vote; and Beverley his garter; and, what is worth all the rest, I shall go to the Hague! the Hague—and then—and then!' and he walked rapidly away, in the direction of Whitehall, with his whole brain boiling with ambition, and his whole heart elated and self-confident. As soon as he had left the room, the new-ereated marquis rang his bell, and when his valet entered— “Anderson,” he said, “let Perkins take the green chariot, that has the coronet only and the cipher on the panels, in embossed work, down to the coachmaker's, and have them altered instantly for a coronet and the letter B—the silver-mounted harness must be all changed likewise, in the same manner. Do you understand?” “Yes, my lord.” “And let him tell Mr. Ryckman that all must be ready by two hours after noon— that it must be ready. I shall require it to go to St. Stephen's. My Lady's chairs must be remounted also, and the coach newly painted—and do you see that the liveries are correct—” “Correct, my lord?” “Yes! correct, you blockhead—correct! The Marquis of Beverley's—do you understand, you stupid fellow?” “Yes, my lord marquis,” replied the man, with an obeisance almost oriental in its depth and duration—“your orders shall be performed instantly, my lord marquis.” “Now, then, follow me to the dressing room, I want my coat, and periwig, and sword. Has the marchioness come down stairs yet?” “Yes, my lord marquis.” And strutting away like a peacock, with his head half a foot higher than when he had come down stairs, as yet an honest man, he conceived that he had made a capital bargain in swopping a way his own conseience, and the happiness of two or three human beings, one of them his own daughter, for an empty title, and a yard of satin ribbon! CHAPTER III. In the room adjoining the library where the Earl of Asterly—now Earl, or Asterly, no longer—and his ministerial guest had been carrying on their political machinations, two ladies were seated at a breakfast table, which, for the benefit of the pleasant air of the sweet May morning, had been drawn up to a large open window of the French fashion; giving access to a balcony full of the rarest exotics cultivated at that day. The room was sumptuously furnished in the gorgeous style of the period, with cabinets of buhl and marquetry, tables inlaid with the most precious Indian woods, armed chairs and sofas cushioned with Genoa velvet, curtains of flowered brocade, Persian or Turkey carpects, several fine pictures by Sir Peter Lely and Vandyke, and two or three well executed marble statues, copies from the antique, the taste for which articles of virtu had just begun to be considered fashionable in England, when it was checked for awhile by the rude and ignorant barbarism of the Puritan iconoclasts, not to revive again until the kingdom returned to the rule of its legitimate hereditary monarchs. The ladies were very different both in age and appearance—more different, indeed, in appearance, than the difference in age would seem to justify in relations so near as a mother and her daughter. The elder lady was a small, slight, meagre person, considerably below the middle size; and, though she had been praised and admired in the zenith of her womanhood for the sylph-like and graceful symmetry of her proportions, her figure was now angular and emaciated, and almost disagreeable to look upon. Her face, and features, too, had in her younger days been called handsome, and to this hour her high and intellectual forehead bad preserved its fiue contour, and its expressiou of solidity and thoughtfulness. Little, however, else was there left, that could be called pleasing in her aspect—large, keen, black eyes, piercing and cold as iee, placed very near together, gave an air of craft and shrewd half-malignant cunning to features which would otherwise have been bold and commanding; her nose was almost Roman, thin, high, and nearly fleshless; her mouth compressed and characteristic of both energy and resolution. It was impossible to look at her even for a moment without perceiving that she must be a person of exceedingly superior mental faculties, of capabilities more stern and sustained, and of an intellect more massive and imposing than are natural to her sex; and at the same time it was almost equally impossible not to believe that she must be as deficiently endowed with the qualities of the heart, as she was pre-eminently furnished with those of the head. There was, indeed, something more than mere craft, and coldness, and inflexibility of purpose written upon her keen polished lineaments; for never stranger looked upon her without a vague feeling of dislike and apprehension; a sort of intuitive sense, that here was one of those few beings to whom the sufferings of their fellows are not only wholly unimportant, when ministering to their own advancement, but are actually subjects of curiosity and interest, and of a kind of pleasurable excitement. The other was an extremely beautiful girl of about eighteen or nineteen years, in every respect the very opposite of the lady I have described; for she was rather tall, and though her waist was symmetrical and round, her figure and bust were unusually developed and voluptuous. She was a blonde, too, as decidedly as her mother was a brunette, with a profusion of luxuriant light brown hair, scarcely restrained about her temples by a broad blue ribbon bandeau, and falling down her neck and over her shoulders in heavy silken masses of waving ringlets. Her eyes were of the very darkest blue, almost violet colored, with eyebrows slightly curved, and long lashes, dark as night, giving an air of character and decision to her face, which is usually wanting in very fair beauties. The expression, too, was very-fine and prepossessing; there was mind enough visible in every lineament to counteract everything voluptuous or sensual; while there was not too much to be perfectly compatible with that softness, that predominance of the affectionate and tender feelings, that superiority of the imaginative to the reasoning faculties, which we desire to see in a woman. She looked, in short, such as Wordsworth has so beautifully painted the ideal of her sex— “On a nearer view, A spirit, yet a woman too, With thoughts sublime and fancies free, And steps of virgin liberty; A creature not too bright or good For human nature's daily food, For gentle censures, pleasing wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.” The breakfast table at which they were still seated, although they had finished their slender meal, was very differently arranged from the modest breakfasts of these degenerate days; for although there were chocolate and coffee, and dry toast, and bread in many forms, there were flasks of red and white wine also, and highly seasoned ragouts, and roast wildfowl, and fruits, and pastry in abundance. And not these only, for on a second table were displayed a huge sirloin of beef, a boar's head from the black forest, and an enormous venison pasty, flanked by their regular companion, a vast silver tankard mantling with toast and ale. None of these, however, had they partaken of, limiting themselves to the fresh fruit, and dry toast, and frothing chocolate; and they were now loitering at the board, waiting for the appearance of the master of the house, who had been thus unwontedly detained. At last the sound of the front door, clapping heavily after the visitor, showed them that the detention was at an end, and at the next moment Sir Henry Davenant walked past the window, and seeing the ladies, raised his hat and bowed very low. The blood rushed to the fair face of the younger lady and she said at once, with the ingenuous frankness which was one of her most remarkable characteristics— “Oh! I declare it is that odious man, Sir Henry Davenant. I am sorry that he has been here, for he always leaves my father restless and ill at ease. I suppose it is very wrong of me,” she added, laughing, “but I do really almost hate the man.” “Aye! indeed it is very wrpng, and, what is worse, very ridiculous, and even childish. He is the ablest and most rising young man of his party, and exceedingly clever, well-read, and witty. There is not a man more courted by society, or one more sure to achieve greatness,” replied her mother. “But I have long given up all hopes of ever seeing you rational or like the rest of the world, with your perpetual whims and prejudices.” “I know all that you say, madam,” answered the girl; “and it is all quite true; he is very clever, and witty, and wise too, I dare say, and sometimes he entertains me in spite of myself, and I almost begin to like him. And then most likely he commences some odious tirade against the existence of honesty or honor among men, and of faith or affection among women, and looks at me with that strange fascinating eye, as if he were reading every thought in my bosom, and that dark sneering smile which makes every word he utters, how seriously and solemnly soever, seem like a sarcasm or a mockery. It is as if he were always ridiculing one!” “Most likely he is,” replied her mother; “most likely he is always ridiculing you; for indeed, my dear Fanny, you are most thoroughly ridieulous, with your romantic and Utopian fancies, I do wish I could see you growing a little rational—a little practical—but I grow sick of wishing.” “Well, mother mine,” replied the girl laughing, “I am very sorry for it; but I cannot help it, I do assure you. I cannot like the society, or listen patiently to the conversation of men whose every action, every word, proves so clearly that they are altogether heartless and hollow.” “Heartless!”—cried the elder lady with a harsh and bitter sneer—“heartless! what, prithee, dost thou know about hearts, minion? But here comes my lord, take care that you anger him not with your nonsense, Fanny.” But of this there was little danger, for to do him justice he was at all times a good-natured man, and especially a kind father; and now he wore his face dressed in its brightest garb of smiles, and was evidently in one of his most complacent moods. “We waited breakfast for you awhile, my lord,” said the unconscious marchioness, “but your good friend Sir Henry de tained you so long that we were forced to begin for very hunger. But Fanny will ring for hot chocolate in a moment.” “Sir Henry brought you good news, I am sure, dear father,” cried Lady Fanny, speaking in the same breath with her mother, and springing forward to meet her favorite parent—for if he were pompous and a dullard, he was affectionate nevertheless, and kind hearted, and proud of his children. “What is it? what is it, dear father?” “Nothing that makes much difference to thee, Fan,” he replied with a tender smile, as the beautiful girl threw her arms about his neck—“though it will to thy brother!”—and for a moment his heart smote him for the thought lie had begun to entertain against her future peace of mind. Then turning towards his wife he added— “Yes. Davenant did bring me pleasant tidings. His majesty has been pleased in the most gracious manner, quite unsolicited moreover, to revive in my person the dormant Marquisate of Beverley. There will be a levee and a drawing room on Wednesday of next week, at which you will of course be present to kiss hands.” “A marquis—a marquis!—are you indeed, father? I am so glad—so glad!— because I know you wish it”—exclaimed the lively beauty, clasping her hands together—“and then dear Arthur will be an earl; will he not? and have a seat in the Peers, during your lifetime; and he is sure to distinguish himself, he is so clever.” “I don't know about that, Fan,” replied the marquis; “the title he will have of course, by courtesy at least—but whether he will be called to the Peerage is more doubtful.” And as he spoke, he sat down and helped himself largely to a salmi of teal, which had been kept smoking hot over a silver chafing dish, and to a large goblet of Bordeaux wine. But gratified although his wife was by the announcement, whose spirit was no less ambitious and far-reaching than it was shrewd and piercing, she looked at him steadily, as he applied himself to the good things which he so sincerely loved, and became certain as she gazed, that there was something yet behind. She turned towards her daughter then, and said in the most natural and unconstrained voice in the world, “Frances, my dear, I thought you had promised to visit your cousin, Lady Serena Fortescue, this morning! You can have my chair if you wish it, and Meredith can follow you with two of the running footmen; I cannot endure, child, that you should suffer these unpuactual habits to grow upon you.” “I will go, then, immediately,” said the fair girl, tripping lightly across the room; but as she reached the door which opened on the gland stairease, she nodded her head, and smiled, saying to herself, “A gentle hint once again, that I am de trop! and rather a transparent hint too, for my lady, who generally laps such things up pretty thoroughly. Just as if she cared a rush whether I go to Serena's at twelve of the clock, or earlier. But I will go to her —I will go—for she is a good girl, and I love her dearly. Heigho! I wonder why I feel so sad this lovely morning. A sudden chill seemed to run through my very heart, when I saw that cold-blooded serpent Davenant sneer as he passed the window. I hope it was not ominous— but no! no! I am not superstitious!” The moment she left the breakfast room, the marchioness looked full into her husband's face, and said, “Well, my lord— well! what else—what more have you got to tell me? and what is the price of this?” “Why, is not this enough! is not this more, Adeliza, than we could hope for, or expect, under a ministry who have not hitherto seemed very friendly?” “That is not what I asked you,” answered the lady very sharply, “I asked you what more you expected, and what price you had paid for this?” “Price! price! my lady!” replied the new marquis, in his most dignified and stately manner, “how can you think of anything so disgraceful, or speak of it in so coarse a manner, my dear lady?” “Yes, price, my lord marquis, I said price! Everything has its name; and the name of the pledge, or promise, or vote, or concession, or whatever else you gave the ministry for this title, is its price! Now, then, I saw just now in your eye that you wished to consult me about something or other. I dare say it is not of the slightest consequence! and if that is the case, or if you have changed your mind, I will go my way, and get my tatting—but if you mean to speak, speak plainly—for you are not exactly a sphinx, to propound riddles; nor do I desire to be the Œdipus to unravel yours, which I think would be rather unperspicuous than otherwise.” The cruel sarcasm of her tone and manner, even had her words been less bitter, would have been enough to hinder any but the weakest of men, and most domineered of husbands from replying; but it had no such effect on the marquis, long used to hear and obey the imperious mandates of his wife, whose superior intellect he could not but acknowledge. He answered, therefore, and at last to the point. “Of course I gave the ministers a written pledge of my adherence to their party, and support of their measures; but no one can presume, except you, my dear Adeliza, who may do anything with impunity, to speak of my title as the price of this, since it was granted before my adhesion.” “And did you know that it was granted, Beverley?” “Why, not exactly, not entirely—Davenant did not—that is to say, my lady—” “That is to say, my lord, `not one word about it?'—of course you did not; for if you had, you would not have promised entire adherence to a party, some of whose measures you almost stand pledged to oppose. But now comes my second question—what more do you expect to gain from them, as the price of your abandoning the Protestant interests?” “The vacant stall—the garter! marchioness!” he answered, even more pompously than his wont, though he had writhed visibly as she gave his conduct its true appellation. “The garter, indeed! the garter!” she said, a flush of exultation beaming across her pallid and sallow face. “That is indeed worth playing for—that is indeed worth an apostasy! But how is this? I thought Lauderdale was to have had it?” “He does aspire to it, my lady. But it will be mine notwithstanding; or I am much mistaken.” “You generally are very much mistaken,” said she quietly, and then resumed, “But what is to be the price of this— what new iniquity?” “Upon my soul, my lady!” answered the marquis, writhing under the conseiousness that all the harsh words she used were richly merited, and at the same time losing temper at her taunts—“you are a most extraordinary personage; one would think you were vexed or angry at the very things which you constantly urge and encourage me to do. I should like monstrously to know whose wish it was that I should sue for the marquisate!—it is too provoking! quite too provoking!” The lady arched up her eyebrows as he spoke, and smiled, as was her wont, and then answered very meekly, “Oh! never mind, my dear lord, what sort of a personage I am. I should think 5 you must know that pretty well, by this time; and pray do not fancy that I am vexed, for on the contrary I am prodigiously delighted. Still I like calling everything by its right name, and you know quite as well as I do—for, though by no means clever, you do not lack a certain sort of plodding common sense, which is capable of discerning right from wrong! You know, I say, quite as well as I do, that it is miquitous for a politician to desert his party, and vote against his conscience, which you are going to do, you know, on the Irish Bill; that is to say, so far as you have got a conscience! Oh yes! it is certainly very iniquitous! though at the same time it may be, and is very expedient; and much more creditable to you as a convenient husband, and provident father, than as a public man or a patriot; which, after all, you never were, nor will be! But come, you have not told me what you are to do for the garter.” “Well then, if you will have it in plain English—” “To be sure—to be sure—that is the only way—” “If you will have it, I am to bring Lord Henry St. Maur over to our side; and persuade him to vote the Irish Bill, which will carry it for the ministers by a majority of two. It is a tie now—St. Maur voting in the opposition.” “Excellent! excellent!—” exclaimed the lady, clapping her hands joyfully together, and now appearing to be really delighted—“which you can do very easily, by breaking off Fan's match with Sir Edward Hale, and promising her hand to the other—that will buy him!—of course that will buy him!—and though Fanny can't endure him, and loves Hale with all her heart, that can't be helped, you know! Girls can't expect that their whims should be gratified, when the advancement of their families stands directly in the way.” It is perfectly true that the Marquis of Beverley had resolved in his own heart to do exactly as his wife stated—that he knew the complete and unquestionable truth of every word she uttered, touching his daughter's hatred to St. Maur, and love for Sir Edward Hale—in both of which feelings he had hitherto given her his full sanction; for, where his base and grovelling ambition stood not in the way of his paternal feelings, he was a kind and indulgent father. It is true, likewise, that he knew St. Maur to be worthy of the hatred, and Hale to merit all the love— and, having well considered all these things, he meant to sacrifice poor Fanny's happiness without a moment's hesitation. Still, as his wife suggested it in her barefaced sarcastic manner, he positively shuddered—stung to the quick by the malicious ingenuity with which she probed his very soul, and held up his every vice and meanness clearly and visibly before his eyes. And yet she was no paradox, that artful bitter woman. She had deliberately, when a young, beautiful, clever, and much admired girl, married the gross and dullard earl, at the promptings of her ambition. Almost hating herself, when she found that the world had penetrated and branded her motives with their right name; and hating him to a degree that can hardly be imagined—a degree increasing day by day with the mortifications which his pompous stupidity day by day heaped upon her, she avenged herself to the utmost of her powers—perpetually driving him on to the commission of fresh meannesses, so as to gratify that ambition, which she now only lived for; and constantly tormenting him by exhibiting those meannesses to himself in the most odious light. Having herself smothered down and stifled in her bosom a sincere and honorable passion for a young man who, though poor and of small pretension when she abandoned him for his dull titled rival, had since risen, by dint of worth and talents only, to high rank and power, she could not even think of prosperous and happy love without disgust and fury. Disliking her own daughter, because she felt her to be equal to herself in intellectual parts, and superior in all other qualities—jealous of her, because she perceived how popular she was in all society—fearful of her, because she felt that her own baser essence must naturally be revealed by the test of her purer spirit, as Satan's at the touch of Ithuriel's lance—this bad and unnatural wife and mother almost rejoiced that, while advancing her own narrow and morbid ambition, she was torturing the guilty conscience of her lord, and breaking the heart of her too virtuous and charming daughter. The marquis, I say, positively shuddered, as she revealed to him his own future intentions and their consequence; and he was silent a minute or two before he answered— “Poor Fan! I am afraid it will grieve her a little while at first; but young ladies' love-smarts are not generally very lasting. And St. Maur is young and handsome, and has far greater wealth than Hale, and title also—I daresay she will be very happy.” “I daresay,” answered his wife, with another sneer. “Fanny's mind is just of the sort most likely to be captivated by money, which she calls dross—and title which you have often heard her style tinsel! Do not you think so? And then as St. Maur never keeps less than three or four mistresses, and is the most confirmed gambler in London, and drinks, they say, frightfully, and has a most infernal temper —he shot his favorite horse in the park the other day, with his servant's pistol, because it shied from a passing carriage! On all these accounts, I say, he is very likely, I think, to make her happy. But as it must be done, there is no use in troubling ourselves about it. How do you purpose to proceed?” “I thought of writing to St. Maur to inform him that we have thought better of the addresses he paid to Lady Frances Asterly, and that were it not for his unfortunate opposition to my party, especially on the Irish Bill, we should rejoice to receive him as our son-in-law!” “Upon my word, Marquis, you improve—you grow quite diplomatic. Yes, that will do very well, for as Henry is not scrupulous, and is very much in love with Fan's pretty figure, and has not an iota of principle, he will doubtless chop about like a weathercock, in less time than it takes to talk about it. But how will you get on with Fanny?” “I shall merely tell her that I have changed my mind, and that she must marry St. Maur.” “Then she will merely tell you that she will do nothing of the kind, and she will keep her word, too, as she always does. That will never do, my lord—never— never!” “How then? I do not see how else it can be managed.” “She must be made to think Edward Hale faithless to her—told of some evil and dishonorable deeds of his, artfully simulated, and if not true, at least, truth-like. Hold—where is St. Maur now?” “Staying with Hale at Arrington—Davenant told me so just now.” “Yes! yes! I recollect he told me himself he was going down thither to celebrate a birth-day, or some such Tomfoolery; and Percy Harbottle is to be there too, and that notorious pendable Captain Spencer. Let me see—let me see—I will write myself to St. Maur and to Spencer also to-day. They can surely either invent something that will do the business with Fan; or, what would be much better still, lead Edward in reality to commit some disgraceful action—to cheat at cards —or rather, for he is incapable of that, to get drunk and play, so that they could lay the imputation on him, or to carry off some country wench or other. Lord! it will be as easy, as they say, as lying, marquis! But I forgot—I beg your pardon—I forgot that you do not like to hear the names of the things you do every day. There, there—do not stay to answer me now; but go away and write your letter to St. Maur; and write it as short as you can, do you hear, and as much to the point— and none of your honorable and virtuous rhodomontades, I beseech of you—which are always ridiculous, and impose on nobody, you know; because nobody in the world believes in such things as honor or virtue; and which would be doubly out of place here, because St. Maur, I am sure, would not know the meaning of the words. There, now; why don't you go away and do it?” “Because I want to know what I shall do with the letter, after I have written it, my lady,” answered her lord, quite crest-fallen, and stripped of all his peacock plumes of self-complacency and pompousness. “Bring it to me, that I may read it, first of all, and see how many absurdities you can contrive to squeeze into six lines, and then enclose it in a long letter of my own to this young hopeful. You must send a man off with it post to-day; he can reach Arrington to-night, and return to-morrow morning. Benedict, the newly hired man will do, and he must wear plain clothes, and take care that he drop no hint whose man he is, or whence he comes; but I will tutor him.” “And then—” began the marquis, in an inquiring tone. “And then,” she answered, with a sneering accent, “you can go and order the coronets on the carriages and harnesses to be altered, and choose new buttons at the button-maker's and new liveries at the tailor's—business just suited to your calibre.” “I have sent Anderson to do all that two hours ago at least. Do you suppose it possible—” “I crave your pardon,” replied the lady, with an air of affected blandness, “I onght not to have supposed it possible, marquis—possible, that business of real instance or moment could banish from your mind those nice frivolities and frivolous niceties which are so thoroughly congenial to natures as comprehensive and politic as your own. And then, since you have done all this, I would go, were I you, to Master Child's, and order a new service of gilt plate, with the proper supporters and coronets, marquis. That will be an amusement for you; and the old plate is getting rather out of date. I believe it was as old as the creation in your grandfather's time, who was, I think, a Lincolnshire grazier! But go—do go, and write the letter!” CHAPTER IV. When Sir Edward Hale left the meadow of the May-pole in the manner I have described, he galloped forward at three quarters' speed of his fine brown hunter, Eversly having some difficulty in keeping up with him, until he reached the foot of the western slope of the valley, where he slackened his pace, and rode on for a while in a deep reverie. And was it indeed Rose, on whom, as Hunter insinuated, the young baronet cast that quick glance, which had so nearly cost him a heavy fall from his horse? Reader, it was —for like most youths of hot impetuous dispositions, he was a passionate admirer of female beauty; and Rose's loveliness was, in truth, of so high an order, that it might well have attracted the eyes even of a colder and less inflammable nature. She was, indeed, in face and figure, a paragon, more fitted for the sphere of courts, than for the simple and somewhat hard realities of a plain country life. Her beauty was not the mere animal beauty, consisting chiefly of fresh coloring and vigorous health, which marks so freqently the country maiden—it was of a far higher and more delicate order. Had she been robed in unison, she might have moved, her birth and rank unquestioned, among the most magnificent array of England's aristocracy—for she was very tall, and though her swelling bust and ample shoulders, and all her lower limbs were exquisitely modelled and developed to the most voluptuous symmetry, her waist was small and tapering, and the whole contour of her person slender and graceful. Her arms were like rounded ivory—her hands, small, delicate, and fair, as if they had been little used to any hard or menial labor—her ankles trim and shapely, and her feet singularly little for so full and tall a figure. Her face, however, was yet more strik ing than her person—it was that of a clear brunette, with but the palest flush of the most delicate rose tinging the lustrous darkness of her cheek—her features approached nearly to the classic model, but there was a trifling upward inclination in the outlines of the well shaped thin nose, which added a charm of archness, that regularity too often will be found to lack— her ponting lips were, if such a thing can be, almost too deeply crimson; for to nothing that exists, of warm and soft and sentient, could the hue of that balmy mouth be possibly compared. It was the eyes, however, the large, deep lustrous eyes, of the darkest hazel, that caught most suddenly the observation of all who looked upon her, if it were but for a passing moment—there was an indescribable fascination in those eyes, an inexplicable mixture of wild out-flashing light, and soft voluptuous languor, half amorous, half melancholy, such as is rarely indeed seen at all, and never but in orbs of that clear translucent brown, that is so far more beautiful than the dull bead-like black, or the more shallow glitter of the blue. Her hair, of a dark sunny brown, shining with many an auburn gloss, where the light fell strong upon its heavy masses, was luxuriantly abundant; falling off on each side of her high polished forehead in a maze of thick clustering ringlets, and flowing down her neck, and over her sloping shoulders, in large and natural curls. The dress of this fair girl was simple as it could be; yet, perhaps, no magnificence of garb would have so well displayed her wondrous charms as that undecorated garment. A low-necked frock of plain white muslin, sitting quite close to her bust and slender waist, with tight sleeves reaching to the elbow, and terminating there in ample plaited ruffles, and a long flowing skirt—a little cottage bonnet of home-made straw, with a pink ribbon to match her silken neckerchief and sash, a cluster of violets in the bosom of her frock, and a nosegay in her hand, the gift —much prized that morning—of the now half-rejected lover. Such was the choicest finery of the village belle, and, as I have already said, it would have been hard indeed to deck her comely person in anything that could have displayed her beauties with more advantage. Those were the days, in courts, of whalebone stomachers and hoops five fathoms in circumference; of stiff brocaded stuffs, and powdered head-dresses; of art, and most ungraceful art, against any touch of nature. Grace and simplicity were discarded, and every native movement, so beautiful in its natural ease, was hampered and confined by every species of ligature and bandage that the most depraved and artificial taste could by any means imagine or suggest. What wonder, then, that Edward Hale, a passionate admirer, as he was, of female beauty, accustomed so much to the stiff airs and affected minanderies of starched ladies, should have been momentarily struck by the natural and simple loveliness of that fair villager, whose every turn and motion was full of poetry, and instinct with easy life. What wonder, then, that when he crossed the hill, and lost sight of the gay concourse, he should have called the keeper up to his side, and asked him quite abruptly— “Tell me, Mark Eversley, tell me,” he said, not without a slight shade of embarrassment appearing in his manner, “who was that fine old silver-headed farmer who stood close to me on the left-hand side, when my horse reared so suddenly? There was a tall young fellow at his elbow, with a quarter staff—Frank Hunter, I believe, if I have not forgotten more than I think I have. I used to ferret rabbits with him, if it be the same, many a year ago, in the Monk's coppice. But who was the old farmer, Mark? I can't remember him.” “Oh, that was Master Castleton, I think, Sir Edward,” answered the fellow, with a cunning grin, clearly perceiving the drift of his master's question, “there was a very pretty lass upon his arm, wasn't there, sir?” The hot blood rushed to the brow—the ingenuous brow—of the young gentleman; and, vexed at the bare idea that his thoughts should be read, his secret penetrated by a menial, he answered hastily— “Was there? I did not notice—I hardly think there was, though; for I suppose I should have observed her, if there had been—seeing that I am a great admirer of pretty faces.” “I'm sure, then, you'd admire Rose's.” answered the wily keeper, “for it's the prettiest eye, and the handsomest face, too, in all the village; and then her shape is not behind her face, neither. But I'm a-thinking it couldn't have been Master Castleton, else, as you say, you must have noticed Rose. It might have been old Andrew Bell, or Simon Carter, or John Hall, they were all gathered thereabout, and they are all grey-headed men, too.” “No, no!” replied the landlord, “it was not any one of these; I recollect them all right well. It must have been old Castleton; what did you call him—Harry?” “No. James, so please your honor; but I don't think it could have been he, anyhow, Sir Edward; least ways I don't see how you could have missed observing Rose. Why, bless you! she's the beauty of the village; there's not a girl like her for twenty miles around. I don't believe, Sir Edward, you ever saw a handsomer in London.” “Well, now I think on it, I believe there was a girl—a very tall girl—on his arm; dressed all in white, was she? but Oliver reared up, just then, and that prevented me from taking notice, I suppose. What is she? daughter to old Castleton?” “Yes, sir; and troth-plighted, they say, to that Frank Hunter, d—n him? but I don't reckon much of that, for she's an arrant jilt—is pretty Rose. Why she kept company with me, Sir Edward, six months and better, and then flew off as if she was meet for a king, when I asked her to be my wife. I warrant me she'd fly from Frank, there, just as sudden, so be she could 'light on a higher or a richer sweetheart.” “Well, well!” said Hale, half angrily, perhaps, at feeling that his servant was tampering with thoughts that were even then, though faintly and uncertainly, at work in his own bosom, and not being yet prepared to be hurried on his way— “well, all that's nothing to me, Mark. But why did you damn the young fellow, Eversley? He used to be as fine a lad as any in the country; and, if he did win your sweetheart, I dare say that he won her fairly. You should not bear a grudge, man; all goes by luck in love and liking.” “Oh! it's not that, Sir Edward, it is not that at all! I would not now have the girl if I could; I'm very glad he took her off my hands, and very grateful to him for it. I would not have her now, I'm sure, unless it was for a mistress—and that she is not like to be for a poor fellow, whatever she might for a born gentleman. It is not that, at all, that made me damn him; but, bless you! he's the biggest poacher in the country!” “Ha! is he—is he? that's bad; we must see to that. Have you got any proof against him?” “Not clear—not clear, Sir Edward; but I keep a tight watch on him always, and I'll be nabbing him, I warrant me, one of these times.” “Do so—do so!” returned the other, forming, almost unconsciously, a secret feeling of dislike to the young man, who was known as the accepted suitor of Rose Castleton. “Do so; and if we catch him tripping badly, we can send him out of the country, or, perhaps, get him pressed on board the fleet; and then you can get the pretty Rose, you know.” “Oh! I don't want her, sir—not I,” returned the keeper, “I would not marry her at all, unless I was to be well paid for it, and then I'd marry the foul fiend if need were.” “Fie! fie! Mark!” answered Hale— “don't talk in that profligate manner, I beg of you. But, tell me, where does old Castleton live now? Your father was saying something to me about his lease, I think, this morning. It has run out, I fancy, and he wants it renewed.” “Yes, yes, Sir Edward,” the other interrupted eagerly, “it has run out; and he does want it renewed; but then, Sir Edward, it's the home-farm, like; between Monk's coppice and Raywood; and the spring-brook trout pond lies in the very middle of it—all the best ground for game in the whole manor—and the best water, too, for fishing! Now I've been thinking that it will make bad work, if Hunter marries Rose, and Castleton gets a new lease. Why, bless you, sir! Frank would not leave a feather in the woods, or a fin in the waters, after he'd lived in the home farm a fortnight; besides, the kennel lies so handy; it always seemed to me the keeper should live there. I was going to speak to you about that myself. I should like well to rent it; and my two brothers could look after it, so that I would not be kept from my duties, neither.” “I'm afraid, Mark, that can't well be; for, you see, I promised not to remove any tenant; and, besides, old Castleton lived there, under my grandfather, if I remember rightly; and has been a good tenant, too. But I won't forget you, Mark, never fear; for I won't forget you. But now we must make haste, or we shall be late at Barnsley;” and, with the words, he again put spurs to his horse, and rode on as fast as he could gallop, until he reached the little post-town, where he drew bridle at the door of the next country inn, and called aloud to the hostler, who came running across the court-yard towards him—asking whether “Lord Henry St. Maur and Captain Spencer had arrived from London!” But, before the man had time to answer, a loud burst of laughter from within replied; and then a gay voice cried— “Here we are, Ned; here we are; and here have we been these two hours. Come in—come in hither; quick, man, or that rogue Percy Harbottle will finish the cool tankard before you get a taste of it. Our horses will be ready in a minute; come, make haste, you must be athirst this hot day!” Edward Hale leaped down at the jovial summons, and flinging his rein to the keeper, ran up the steps, and entered the small clean parlor, to the left of the passage, where he found his three friends merrily employed in circulating a mighty silver flagon, filled with the generous compound of ale and sherry, sugar and toast and spices. Three very comely personages were they, who occupied the solitary parlor of the country inn; three such, indeed, as it had probably never contained at one time before, such that not the landlord and landlady only, but Doll the chambermaid, and Dick the tapster, and even fat old drunken Deborah, the cook, had contrived to find something or other to do in that parlor, in order to get a glimpse of the handsome gentlemen from London. They were three in number, all of distinguished family, and of appearance and manners suitable to their rank, and none of them above the middle age, though two were scarcely beyond their boyhood. The eldest of the three was the notorious Captain Spencer, a peer's second son, the commander of a gallant frigate now in commission, and as Lady Beverley had truly designated him, within an hour of the time when he was sitting there so calm and unruffled, although he knew it not, the most celebrated pendable of the metropolis. Of tried and distinguished courage, a good seaman for those days, a gentleman of the most courtly and finished manners, the Honorable Edmund Spencer was perhaps as thorough a debauchee and reprobate as existed at that day in all England. An admirable player at all games, a perfect musician, a very graceful dancer, his success among women had been almost unparalleled; and, although several of his adventures had been marked by very thorough depravity, and had terminated miserably for his fair victims, still fair and virtuous and innocent and noble women were found to smile upon the cold-hearted seducer, while they had not one tear to shed for the hapless beings he had brought down to shame and misery and untimely death. With men, his ready wit, his liberality, his frankness, and his courage, made him even more generally a favorite than he was with the softer sex. The very boldness of his vice was to him a protection; and, as it seemed, a fresh claim on the world's admiration. No subterfuge had ever sullied his character for truth—whatever wrong he did to any one, he avowed it openly, and gave honorable satisfaction. He had shot one husband dead, and desperately wounded two brothers, fighting to avenge wife's and sister's reputation. An honorable man par excellence was the Honorable Edmund Spencer. Yet many a better man had expiated his crimes on the gallows. Spencer was at this time about forty-three years old, although no person would have suspected him of being nearly that age; he was extremely handsome, though of a dark and somewhat saturnine complexion, with a full bright black eye, an aquiline nose, and one of the most fascinating smiles that ever wreathed a lip in blandishment. His hair, black as the raven's wing, and without one speck or line of grey, was exquisitely soft and glossy, and almost as redundant in its fall of natural tresses as the huge wigs of the day. His voice was silvery music, and by long habit he had learned to modulate his accents like the tones of a delicate instrument. For the young of both sexes never was created an enemy more dangerous than Edmund Spencer. In the slightest glance of his eye there lurked wily fascination— in the most trivial word he uttered there was a covert meaning—a concealed power! But his smile, his caress, his friendship, or his love, were ruin—utter, inevitable ruin! His dress, although in some degree professional, was rich and magnificent; for at that period a gentleman could be recognised by his distinctive garb alone, from his valet. He wore a coat, cut in the naval form, with the open sleeves of the period, showing from the elbow to the wrist the shirt sleeves of plaited lawn fringed with ruffles of superb Valenciennes lace. It was of dark blue cloth, long waisted and broad skirted, lined throughout with white sarcenet. His breeches were of blue velvet, and his vest of the same color, both slashed with white silk, and adorned with many buttons of solid gold, embossed with the crown and anchor. He wore high boots and spurs, having travelled thither on horseback, being, rather an uncommon thing for a sailor, a perfect and graceful cavalier—his hat, with a band of feathers, and a short crooked hanger lay on the table near him. Lord Henry St. Maur, who was standing up with his back to the fire-place, now filled with green and May-flowers, instead of its winter decoration of sea coal, was a tall, slight, fair young man, with nothing particular in his appearance, unless it were a mixed expression of licentiousness and audacity, which ill became his beardless lip, and smooth, effeminate features. He was dressed far more splendidly than the sea captain, in a full suit of maroon colored velvet, lined and slashed with philomot satin, and decorated with large ribbon shoulder knots of the same color. He had much costly lace at his bosom and wrists; the buttons of his coat and his knee buckles and sword hilt glittered with brilliantly cut steel; and to complete the picture, a huge fleece of curls, the natural hue of which was disguised by a profusion of reddish marechal powder, fell down over his shoulders, and impregnated the whole atmosphere of the inn-parlor with musk and ambergris, and Heaven knows what besides. Percy Harbottle, the third of the company, was the youngest likewise, and the least worthy of notice, though perhaps the most worthy to be esteemed a gentleman. He was good-looking, and good-humored; and, though by no means a fool, certainly neither a genius nor a wit—in a word, he was a frank, lively, generous-hearted, rash, impetuous young man, likely enough to be hurried by evil association into the contracting of bad habits, and of committing follies, or becoming subject to the more venial vices—but kindly at the same time, and honorable if unthinking. In fact, he was a type of that large class of youths at all times floating like the froth on the top of that great syllabub—the social world!—whom every one pronounces an “excellent good fellow,” without being able in the least degree to specify wherein their excellence consists—whose greatest merits are good looks and animal good-humor, and whose greatest demerit is a want of ballast, of stability of character, and singleness of purpose, without which a man may be agreeable, but cannot possibly be great. Such was Percy Harbottle—and there be many Percy Harbottles around us everywhere—who, exquisitely, and rather coxcombically attired in light blue silk, laced with gold, and bewigged and bepowdered to the very acme of the mode, was, at the moment of Sir Edward's entrance, apparently justifying the apprehensions of the others concerning the contents of the tankard, by the prodigious draught which he was making on its racy mixture. He sent it down, however, and drawing a long breath, as Hale came in, jumped up with a good deal of eagerness, and with his hand extended, to meet him. Spencer arose also, and put out his hand; but though there was much elegance and grace in every motion, though his tones were perfect harmony, and his words not well chosen only, but courteous and even friendly, there was something that gave the young baroneta strong impression of the sea-captain's heartlessness; for he had known him before but slightly, and was now receiving him rather as a friend of his school-fellow St. Maur, than as an intimate of his own choosing. The truth was, that although the captain's manner was exquisite, it was too evident that it was manner only—there was a total want of cordiality, or warmth, or in fact of any feeling. And, sooth to say, it would have been very strange had there not been that want—for it was on his total freedom from all touch of genuine nature, his complete mastery over his strongest feelings, his absolute impassibility of temper, and immobility of feature, on which Edmund Spencer prided himself the most. He had been all his life acquiring it—and though he had given much pains to many fine accomplishments, to none had he devoted half the study this had cost him. No wonder he was perfect in it! St. Maur nodded, and smiled, and thrust out a single finger, with a delicious attempt at nonchalance. He was really glad to see Edward Hale, whom he liked as well as he liked anything, except himself; that is to say, so far as he amused him, and gave him no trouble—and he said he was glad—but he said it as if he was rather sorry than otherwise. He wanted to be easy and careless; he had heard Spencer ridicule enthusiasm as boyish and ladylike—and he had the greatest horror in the world of being thought a boy; and in endeavoring to be un-enthusiastic, one of the nil admirari school, he became as stiff as the poker, and as unnatural and unlike his model, whom he flattered himself he was very closely imitating, as it is possible to conceive. In a few minutes, however—for St. Maur's character was far too impulsive and ill-regulated to be true to anything— even to itself, for above half an hour—he became boisterous and noisy, and displayed spirits so exuberant as to justify in some measure Perey Harbottle's assertion, that he had only drained the tankard, which it appeared on inspection he had done to the very dregs, for the purpose of preserving him from the commission of such a solecism as to be drunk before dinner. “Upon my life!” said Spencer, “I do not feel so perfectly assured that you were in time enough to save him, Percy! Who will bet odds that he does not tumble off his horse before we reach Arrington?” “I will, by heaven!” cried St. Maur himself; “I will, in rouleaux! is it done!” “No, not exactly,” answered Spencer, laughing, “not with you, my dear fellow; for if I did, you would not drink any more in the first place; and in the second, you would keep yourself quiet; and, in short, I should not be sure of winning.” “And do you never bet, Captain Spencer,” asked Hale, half jesting and half serious, “but when you are sure to win?” “Never, my dear sir, never,” replied Spencer, in his blandest tones, “do you?” “Generally, I am afraid,” said Sir Edward, laughing merrily. “Ah! so does Harbottle; except that for `generally' you may read `always.' Harbottle always bets when he is not sure to win; or, in other words, when he is sure to lose. He pays too, which is something in these days. Harbottle is an undeniable man to bet with. I bet with him myself a good deal.” Nothing could, indeed, be more strictly true than this last assertion of the gallant captain, to whose gentlemanlike necessities Percy Harbottle's betting-book annually ministered, to the tune of a cool thousand, at the least reckoning. A more cunning and less artful man than he would have shunned the topic and been detected by his silence. Spencer knew better, and talking of it openly, those who knew it to be true scarcely believed it, and those who were not certain utterly scouted the idea. For a few minutes after this, the young men conversed merrily and gaily of fifty trivial incidents which had occurred since their last meeting; and light jokes called forth lighter laughter; as for the most part is the case when the gay-hearted and the cheerful, over whose head time has not shed a single sorrow, meet after passing absence. But by-and-by the replenished tankard was once again exhausted, and the young comrades soon began to lack some newer and more keen excitement. “Come, come,” cried Edward Hale, “let us get, all of us, to horse, and ride, as quickly as we may, back to the manor. There is a kind of merry-making of the villagers—a May-day frolic on the green; and, as it is my birth-day too, I was obliged to promise the good people there that I would join their sports; and, what is more, to ask them all to dine with me at noon, under a tent. I am afraid it will be but a tedious sort of merriment to you, my boys, after the gaieties of London; but we must make the best of it; and, to compensate for it, we'll sup at eight, when all is over, and try my father's choice old Burgundy.” “Ods-life!” cried St. Maur, “there will be nothing tedious in it so far as I'm concerned; for, I doubt not, you have store of pretty lasses here among your tenantry? and if we are to pass the summer here with you, you know, we must look out for something in the shape of bona robas to while away the time before the shooting season.” “Well, well, Lord Harry, you shall see all of them, I promise,” answered the baronet, with a quick meaning smile; “but then it must be honor bright. You shall have every help from me in your amours, but then you must not interfere with mine —hey, St. Maur?” “Hark to him—hark to him, Spencer; hark to him, Harbottle!” cried the young lord, laughing; “did you, in all your lives, did you ever hear such a Turk? Why, he only came down hither last night, for the first time these sixteen years, and the dog has cut out an intrigue already!” “Oh, I don't wonder at it, not I, in the least,” Harbottle answered; “the fellow always had the eye of a hawk for a pretty wench, and the devil's own luck in winning them, too. Don't you remember, St. Maur, how he tricked Neville, at Christ Church, out of his black-browed Julia, after two days' acquaintance, when Neville had been better than six months in bringing her to reason?” “And Neville such a lady-killer, too!” lisped St. Maur; “but I suppose we had better promise him.” “To be sure, to be sure we had!” answered the other in a breath, “for if he has got the least start in the world with the girl, we have no more chance of her than the merest bumpkin in the country” “So it's a bargain, Hale,” continued St. Maur; “you will give each of us the best of your countenance and assistance, provided we keep all due distance from your own dulcinea.” “A bargain!” answered the young baronet; and “a bargain! a bargain!” chimed in his gay, licentious comrades. “And now, Sir Edward,” inquired Spencer, gravely, after they had mounted, and galloped a few hundred yards from the inn door, “what is your wench's name, that we may have no mistake here? and what does she look like?” “Her name is Rose Castleton,” answered Sir Edward Hale, the hot blood rushing hurriedly to his brow and cheek, as he named her, against whose peace and honor the wild words of his reckless and unprincipled companions had almost instantaneously matured his vague thoughts into violent designs. “Her name is Rose Castleton; and she is like—simply the most beautiful woman it ever was my luck to gaze upon. The finest and most voluptuous figure—the brightest and most sparkling face—the most luxuriant hair—the softest and most passionate eye! By heaven! the loveliest girl I ever yet have looked upon were but a foil to her transcendant beauties!—but let us hurry on our way, or we shall be too late!” And, at the word, they gave the rein to their good steeds, and touched their sleek sides with the spur, and no one could have found fault with the pace thereafter, till they came to the hill which overlooked the vale of Arrington. CHAPTER IV. No further words were spoken by the gay companions; for, indeed, the fiery rate at which the cavaliers spurred on towards the manor, precluded the possibility of conversation—the thick beating clang of their horses' hoofs on the country road drowning all words pitched in tones lower than a shout. It was, indeed, a charming—a delicious morning; the soft south wind which fanned their brows and fluttered their hair, as they cut through it rapidly, came laden with the fresh odor of the new mown hay, and the mingled perfumes of a thousand wild flowers; for all the hedge-row banks were studded, as thickly as the parterres of a well kept garden, with primroses and cowslips, and dark clustering violets,—the scent of which pervaded the whole atmosphere. The tall hedges, bordering the road on either hand, with their green buds just bursting into leaf, were actually sheeted with white bloom; while many a brier rose flaunting with its red blossoms, and many a honey-suckle hung its rich clusters over brake and thicket. Myriads of larks were pouring their clear merry notes into the cool air, as they floated far beyond the reach of human vision, at the very gates of Heaven; one soaring upward as another dropped, faint and exhausted with the sweetness of his own melody, to repose himself on the fresh greensward, and meditate another hymn. Everything in the sounds and sights of nature, that spoke to the senses of the young men, was pleasant and exhilarating; and from a distance, as if to swell the chorns of general rejoicing, the chime of a village church came pealing down the wind with notes, as it were, of mirthful invitation. Their hearts, too, were glad and jocund; no selfish thoughts, or interested motives, were at that time alive within bosoms too generally the slaves to such evil feelings. They had come down into the free, blithe country to divest their spirits of the cares and half toilsome pleasures, the din and rivalry, the jealousy and turmoil of the great city; and having come they were prepared and willing to be pleased with almost everything. After they had galloped a few miles on their road, the lane which they had followed hitherto turned off almost at right angles to the left hand, another pathway coming in from the opposite direction. Here the young baronet pulled up his horse, and pointing straight forward, over a high wattled fence, dividing a large pasture field from the highway, he called out— “That is our nearest way, gentlemen, by three miles; and over as pretty a line of country as you ever rode across. There is not one ploughed field or meadow in the range; all good firm pasture land, with fair stand-up fences, and one ten foot brook—nothing more; what do you say to a lark?” “By all means! by all means!” cried St. Maur, giving his horse the spur, and sweeping over the fence cleverly; “which is the way?” “Straight for the tall oak tree on the hill, in the third hedge-row; thence you will see the top of the old castle on my grounds; steer straight for that, boys!” And away they went, with whoop and halloa, skimming the bright green fields, and swinging over the easy fences with scarce an effort of their mettlesome and high-bred horses. It was not long, however, before the headlong pace at which they rode brought them to the summit of the hills commanding the scene which has been heretofor described; and so extraordinary was the beauty of that scene, with its tranquil landscape, and gay grouping, that the three guests of the young lord of the manor pulled up, as it were by a common impulse, their hot horses, and uttered a simultaneous expression of surprise and admiration. “Is that your place? By Heaven! you are a luckier fellow than I fancied, Ned,” cried St. Maur. “Give us your hand, old boy; long may you live to enjoy this fair manor!” said Harbottle, yet more cordially. “By the Lord! what a lovely picture. A Poussin in the distance, and a Teniers merry-making in the foreground,” added Spencer, looking at the view with a painter's eye, for he was indeed no mean connoisseur in that delightful art. “It is a fine old place,” Hale answered, gratified much by the pleasure of his friends and college comrades; “but come along, and you shall see the place and its inhabitauts more nearly.” And, with the words, he again touched his horse with the spur, and galloped lightly down the slope, and across the greensward of the common, towards a large and gaily decorated tent, with several flags and streamers fluttering in the summer air above it, which had been erected during his temporary absence, at a short distance from the May-pole. About the entrance of this grand marquee, a dozen or more of Sir Edward's servitors were clustered, and flinging his rein to the foremost of these as he alighted, he bade the others look to the horses of his friends, and lead them to the stables of the manor. Loud rang the plaudits of the tenantry, as the young master of their destinies, accompanied by his distinguished looking friends—for they were all finely made and handsome men, and all, as I have said, superbly dressed in the rich mode of the day, with gold embroideries, and rich lace, and fluttering shoulder-knots, and waving feathers—walked through the merry throng, now pausing for a moment to shake hands with some sturdy yeoman, whom he remembered as his play-fellow of yore; now listening to the tedious, but not, for that, insincere or unwelcome gratulations of some hoary-headed farmer; now giving brief directions to his steward or serving men concerning the ale butts to be broached, and the ox to be roasted whole by noon; now chucking some bright-cheeked demure looking damsel under the chin, with a light laugh; till all pronounced him the most affable and kindest-hearted landlord in the county, and augured years of peace and comfort under his patriarchal sway. But it was acting all—sheer acting!— natural acting indeed, and such as might have imposed on the shrewdest judge of human nature; and for this reason—that Edward Hale but enacted, at that time, what would have been his own instinctive, natural conduct at another, had his mind been at ease, and his thoughts disengaged; and even while he was thus acting, he was almost if not entirely unconscious of the fact; for he was not a hypocrite—not even a dissembler—, though full many a gay licentious vice might have been laid with justice to his charge, he never had committed any very serious, or at least any premeditated wrong —and was not, in the least degree, a hardened or habitual sinner. But now all the worse portions of his nature were aroused within him. Voluptuous by nature, and not, perhaps, disinclined to sensuality, his attention had been struck at first sight by the singular beauty of Rose Castleron; and a keen, although vague desire of possessing her had occupied his mind for a moment. A little thought, however, had quickly brought him back to his better senses; and while he was thus fluctuating between the influences of his good and evil genii, a single admonition from a wise and sincere friend would have drawn the black drop from his heart. But in the place of the sage adviser, Edward had met the tempter. The question which he asked of his ill-disposed gamekeeper, in curiosity, and from the want of any other interesting topic, had been so answered by that artful man as to inflame the nascent passions of his master; and, by creating a doubt of Rose's mental purity, to palliate to his mind the offence which he soon began to meditate against her. Twofold was the design of Eversley— first, and most prominently, he desired, by basely pandering to the evil qualities of the young baronet, to gain such an ascendency over his mind as might contribute to his own advancement—second, to wreak his vengeance on a girl who had rejected his addresses, and on the man who had won the love of her whom he once courted. With his heart burning yet at the hints and instigations of that bad servant, he had been thrown into the whirl and vortex of licentious merriment which characterized the conversation of his companions; and thus his passions were excited, and his dormant vanity aroued, until by degrees he worked himself into a resolute determination to make Rose Castleton his victim and his mistress. It was on this account that he walked with an absent mind among his shouting peasantry; uneasy that he could not discover the object of his burning passion, and unwilling to inquire her whereabouts, lest he should prematurely wake suspicion. Suddenly, as he passed the May-pole, and neared the hawthoru bush and pastoral throne beneath it, his glad eye fell upon the rustic beauty. She had been chosen Queen of the May, and sat on high, surrounded by the prettiest of the village maidens, upon the grassy seat—her bright eye sparkling even more brightly than its wont, with gratified ambition—her dark cheek flushed with the quick lustre of successful vanity. A crown of gorgeous flowers had now supplanted the humble cottage bonnet, and many a dewy bud was mingled with her long curled tresses; the modest kerchief that had veiled her sloping shoulders and fair neck was gone, and was but insufficiently replaced by a gay wreath which crossed her bosom like a baldric and twined around her waist A tall white lily, meet sceptre for so beautiful a queen, graced her right hand, as with young artless mirth she issued her commamds to the blithe crowd around her. Why does her cheek so suddenly turn pale—why flush to so hot a crimson? Alas! poor maid! her eye met Edward Hale's, as he drew nigh, and again noted the strong and passionate expression of delighted admiration, which it had noted once before. And yet she loved Frank Hunter—ardently, truly loved him! And yet—and yet—oh woman! woman! well said the great Magician of the North, noting thy changeful mood, well did he paint thee— “In hours of ease Fantastic, way ward, hard to please”— for thou, Rose Castleton, loving—most truly and most singly loving—Frank Hunter, and caring nothing for Sir Edward, all for a poor brief triumph of thy sex's passion, and therewithal to punish Frank for his short jealous fit that morning, didst meet the eye of the young baronet, with that half bold, half bashful glance of thine —half innocent, half conscious—that made him fancy thee half won already—made him strain every nerve to win thee. Fair face and graceful form, and eloquence so warm and wily, as never peasant maiden listened to without dread peril, and rare skill in the mazes of the dance, and sumptuous garb, and dignity, and rank! Beware! beware! Rose Castleton. All day he danced with her upon the green; his gay companions selecting for their partners the prettiest three of her attendant nymphs, and, like Sir Edward, monopolizing them the live-long day— and at the noonday feast she sat beside him, her little heart high fluttering with vanity and pleasure and ambition. She had listened to his vows of love, how delicately syllabled to her fond foolish ear—his arms had been about her waist—his lips had snatched a kiss before they parted—and she had promised too— promised to meet him in the Monk's coppice, ere the moon set the following night —and yet, weak fool! she dreamed not that she did any real wrong—and laid the flattering unction to her soul, that she would forgive Frank soon—when she had made him soundly jealous. Beware! Rose Castleton, beware! Heaven succor thee! or thou art but a lost one! CHAPTER VI. The moon rose bright and broad behind the castle hill, and poured its full flood of lustre over the tented meadow, whereon the revels and the dances of the yeomanry were still kept up with unabated spirit, long after the young lord of the manor and his guests had retired from the scene of sylvan merriment. Meanwhile, a ruddy light began to shine out of the oriel windows of the old hall, showing that mirth and gaiety maintained their empire within, as steadily as without the hospitable walls of the proprietor. The supper room was a fine old fashioned chamber, wainscoted and ceiled with dark English oak, polished so brightly that the walls reflected every object almost as distinctly as a crystal mirror. The monotony of the black woodwork was relieved by a rich cornice, round the summit of the walls, of flowers and fruits and arabesques, highly gilt and burnished; the surbase and the panels were surrounded with workmanship of the same kind, as were the posts and lintels of the doors, the chimney-piece, and the frames of several large Venetian looking-glasses that hung, one in each angle of the room, which was an oblong ocragon, reaching from the floor to the roof. The floor, where it was not covered by a fine Turkey carpet, was polished till it was as bright and almost as slippery as ice; the curtains and the furniture were of ruby colored velvet, laid down with broad gold lace; and, when it is taken into consideration that there were above fifty large wax lights in lamps and chandeliers of cut glass with many pendants, so disposed in every part of the hall that it was nearly as light as day, nothing could easily be imagined more grand and striking in the shape of decoration. The table was spread with its snow-white drapery, and a profusion of cut glass and silver glittered upon the board, while the long necks of several flasks of champagne and Bordeaux, protruding from the massive coolers, showed that due preparation had been made to gratify the palate, as well as to delight the eye. Supper was served, and so well was the household of the young baronet organized, that all the guests were loud and sincere in their commendation of his wines, his cookery, his whole menage; and Spencer, the fastidious spoiled child of the world, privileged to find fault with anything at will, whispered aside to St. Maur that his country friend was by no means to be despised as an Amphitryon, and immediately challenging Sir Edward to drink champagne with him, told him aloud in his significant, blunt-seeming manner, “that it would not be his fault if he did not become an habitué at his house—for that his bill of fare was as undeniable as Harbottle's betting book.” It must not be supposed, however, that on this, the first evening of the young heir's majority, he sat down with his three guests alone to supper. Far from it—the board was laid with more than twenty covers, and all the landed aristocracy of the county were assembled to celebrate the birth-day, and welcome the arrival of their young neighbor. Some few of these were men of the world and gentlemen in the highest sense of the word, the venerable Earl of Rochefort and his three noble sons being among the number. The greater part of the company, however, with the exception of one or two clergymen, consisted of country gentlemen, as country gentlemen of that day—for it is of the time of the last of the unhappy Stuarts that I am writing—were almost to a man —that is to say, mere boorish and unlettered sportsmen, staunch riders after stag and fox from sunrise to mid-day; staunch topers at the bottle or the bowl, from afternoon to midnight! It had not been deemed wise, or in any sense advisable, to omit this class of neighbors, for many reasons; not that Sir Edward had the least idea either of becoming one of their number in reality, or of affecting to do so for the sake of gaining their votes; for he entertained no thought of standing for the county, even at a future period; nor, had he done so, would he have condescended, therefore, to any indirection. Something of this sort he slightly hinted to the old peer who sat on his right, while apologizing for the rather uproarious mirth which soon began to prevail at the lower end of the table; but the good old man smiled slightly as he answered— “You do not owe me the least apology, my dear Sir Edward; since all these gentlemen are occasionally guests of mine, likewise, at the castle; and several of them, though somewhat rough and unpolished, are very estimable men in their way; good landlords and good neighbors—upright and charitable, and true English hearts—proud to the proud and kindly to the poor. It may be they are a little addicted to elevating trifles, which are well enough in their way, into the serious occupation of a life-time. But, after all, I do not know which of us all is free from this weakness! and it is at least more venial to pass a life-time in hunting foxes, than in misgoverning nations, merely for pastime.” “I agree with you perfectly, my lord,” said Hale, “and am glad to find that you do not altogether disapprove offox-hunting, as I must confess myself rather fond of it and believe I shall sometimes join my neighbors when the season comes.” “Disapprove of it—oh no!” said the earl, laughing, “so far from that, I was very near determining to set up a pack myself some years since, when your respected father died, Sir Edward—a loss which you were too young to feel at that time—and I should probably have done so, had not our friend, Sir Willoughby de Willoughby, whom I see you have made your vice-president for the day, undertaken them. Oh, no! I think hunting an admirable, bold, and manly exercise, tending to hinder our young men from degenerating into mere city coxcombs, or singing, dancing dilettanti, like the noblesse of Italy— I mean of course, if it be not abused. No, no! indeed; I think there are many pursuits more blameble than hunting, and many associates, too, more dangerous than fox-hunters!” And, as he spoke the words, his eye dwelt for a moment on the handsome face of Capt. Spencer, whose character he knew thoroughly well by reputation; and whom he was extremely sorry to see on terms of intimacy with a young man, to whom, on many accounts, he wished well; and of whom he was disposed, on a very short acquaintance, to think highly. Sir Edward's eye followed the transient glance; and, as he thought he had detected a hidden allusion to himself and his guests, the ingenuous blood rushed crimson to his frank face, and he remained for a moment or two absent and embarrassed. This was not, however, noticed by the old nobleman, for he had not made the observation with reference to Spencer, although the fitness of it struck him the moment he had spoken; and, not wishing to assume the monitor, or to interfere in the affairs of others, he had cast his eyes upon his plate, and appeared to be busy only in apportioning the condiments to his wild fowl. The direction of the earl's eye had not, however, been unnoticed by St. Maur, who, though he did not catch the words uttered, had no doubt, as he saw the glance followed by his host's embarrassment, that something had been said in disparagement of his friend. Nothing occurred, however, at the moment, although a sentiment of dislike was implanted in St. Maur's breast, which he evinced afterwards by taking every opportunity of holding up the old lord to ridicule, as a fanatic and half fool; and of quizzing his sons behind their backs unmercifully, as milksops and twaddlers, scarce one shade better than the country bumpkins round about them. Conversation, except among the few persons at the head of the table, was soon at an end; bumper toasts circulated fast; song followed song; and glees and catches without number were trolled, with far more energy than melody; and cork after cork was drawn; and punch-bowl after punch-bowl was replenished; yet the interminable thirst of the country squires seemed all the thirstier for each attempt to allay it. Before the bounds of decency had yet been transgressed by any person present, the butler entered in a pause between the quick following bursts of song, bearing two letters on a large silver waiter —one of which he handed to Capt. Spencer, and the other to Lord Henry St. Maur, saying aloud, that they had just been brought by a servant, who had ridden post from London, and waited an immediate answer. Just at this moment, the Earl of Rochefort, excused by his age and character from prolonging the festivities of the board to morning light, arose to go; begging, however, that he might not break up the party, and apologizing for carrying off his sons—two of whom were about to set out for London in the morning. There was, of course, a general movement of the company, but at Edward Hale's request they all resumed their seats —he alone following the earl into the hall to take leave of him; while, on the same pretence, but in reality wishing to gain an opportunity of reading their letters, Spencer and St. Maur glided out of the room immediately behind him. A short time was occupied in hunting up cloaks, hats, and swords, but it was not long before the earl's party were all in readiness, and moving towards the hall door. Just as they reached it, after taking leave of Sir Edward, Colonel Hardinge, the peer's eldest son, saw a tall man, in plain riding dress, with heavy boots and spurs, and a courier's leather belt about his waist, standing in the vestibule; and Spencer, who had been questioning him about the letters he had brought, gliding away, as if desirous of escaping observation. There was something so singular in the movement, that the Colonel's attention was called somewhat particularly to the servant, and he at once recognised him for a fellow who had left him, a few months before, in order to take service with Lord Asterly. The man had, as it happened, been rather a favorite servant, and the colonel, without much consideration, said as he passed him, “Ha! Benedict, what has brought you hither? Are you not living still with my Lord Asterly?” “Yes, colonel,” answered the man, quickly, and quite off his guard; and then stammering, and appearing a good deal embarrassed—“that is to say, colonel,” he added, “I have left—I brought letters!” Hardinge, who had merely spoken for lack of anything else to do, and without any great interest in the matter, nodded only and passed on; but Edward Hale had caught the words of the servant, and perceived his obvious confusion; and, as he returned from escorting the earl to his carriage, he stopped and asked— “Did you bring letters for me, my good fellow?” “No, sir,” replied the man at once, “I brought letters for the honorable Captain Spencer, and my Lord Henry St. Maur! and I want their answers, if you please, Sir Edward.” “From Lord Asterly?” asked Hale, in astonishment. “Are you Lord Asterly's man?” “I was, Sir Edward—but—but” and the man began again to stutter, and turned fiery red. “That will do,” answered the baronet, passing on—“it does not signify at all;” and he thought within himself, “that fellow has been drinking—or, if not, he is a knave;” and, with his mind a little disturbed, he re-entered the supper room, where all was revelry and noise, and loud uproarious glee. Spencer and St. Maur had not yet returned into the room; but Percy Harbottle, who had contrived already to render himself very popular with the good-hearted country gentlemen, called to him as he came in— “Come, Ned Hale, come—now that your steady friends have left us, let us set to work instantly; we are bound, I must say to you, in honor, to drink all of these gentlemen under the table, without any more delay—for they have had the audacity to challenge us to the test, and to talk of us Christ-church men as if we were mere milksops. Come, order some mulled Burgundy, and let us fall on gallantly.” “Certainly! certainly!” replied Hale— and muttering to himself, “for this time, at least, there is no help for it, I suppose,” he resumed his chair, and the supper party soon degenerated into a wild and frantic orgie—through which Hale and Harbottle sustained their parts with more success than either had anticipated; for, whether it was that their young and unbroken constitutions offered better resistance to the wine they swallowed than the enfeebled systems of the inveterate topers, or that their quietness of manner, and comparative abstinence during the early part of the evening, gave them an advantage, certain it is, that while reveller after reveller fell from his chair, and was carried, or staggered out of the room to be thrust into his carriage, or conveyed to bed in a state nearly approaching to insensibility, the young men were by no means even seriously affected by the liquor they had drunk; and, when they had seen the last guest safely carried to his chamber, they walked, with feverish brows indeed, and quivering nerves, and blood unduly heated, into the drawing-room, where they found St. Maur and the Captain playing, with perfect coolness, at picquet, and sipping some strong coffee, which Spencer urged them to take as a sovereign remedy against the effect of over-drinking. Edward Hale poured himself out a cup of coffee, and then fixing his eyes quietly on St. Maur's face, asked him in a tranquil voice. “Was your letter from the Asterlys, St. Maur?” “No!” answered St. Maur, steadily, “three tierce majors, captain, and the quatorze of aces, count fourteen.” Spencer looked up quickly, in utter astonishment at the absurd and reekless falsehood of his friend; but not the smallest sign of wonder was visible in his composed manners, or on his inscrutable and impassive features. But he replied at once, eager if possible to repair the evil which he foresaw from St. Maur's injudicious denial—a denial which he knew must sooner or later be discovered, if it was not so already. “Nor I, Sir Edward, nor I, either—from the Asterlys—inasmuch as they are Asterlys no longer—for that I suppose is what Henry means; since I saw him get a letter from the people you mean, at the very moment I got mine—which certainly is from her spiteful ladyship; and a very pretty piece of spite it is too! considering that one would have expected her to be in a better humor.” The wonder which the self-possessed and cold-blooded man of the world had kept down so perfectly, positively beamed from every feature of St. Maur's face, as he heard this avowal, which appeared quite as incomprehensible to him as did his falsehood to the other; who, by one of those marvellous contradictions which we sometimes discover in the characters of men, though he would have done almost any other evil thing in the whole world, wonld not have told a lie to save his life. Astonished as he was, however, he saw the utter inutility of trying to carry the deception out as he had intended. So with a loud and boisterous laugh, he cried out, “Oh! fie, you blab! You mar-sport! You have spoiled all my fun. Why did you not stick to it, Spencer?” “I never say the thing that is not, even in fun!” replied the other gravely; and as he spoke he met a glance of approbation beaming from Hale's clear eye, and noted it; and determined to turn the feeling which it indicated to his purpose. This of course passed as quick as lightning; and at the same moment St. Maur said, for Spencer's shaft had pierced deeply. “Nor I, nor I, Captain Spencer, but your words do not apply; for I said the thing that is—the true thing!—I did not get a letter from the Asterlys.” “True, true!” replied the Captain with a smile, “my remark was uncivil and inappropriate. Excuse it.” “But gentlemen, gentlemen,” interposed Hale, laughing and yet puzzled, “why am I to be left in the basket? how is this, you speak truth to the ear and riddles to the sense? The Earl of Asterly—” “Is Earl of Asterly no longer,” answered Spencer. “It has pleased his most gracious majesty James by the Grace of God, for reasons which I suppose he and his ministers know—for I am sure nobody else does—to create his dull earlship Marquis of Beverley; so now I suppose he will be duller, and more pompous, and more utterly intolerable than ever.” “Indeed, Marquis of Beverley? and news, captain?—” “Is from the new made marchioness. I cannot show it to you, Sir Edward. Ladies' letters you know—but I wish I could, for it is capital—capital!” “Strange, strange!” thought Edward Hale within himself, although he gave his thoughts no utterance; “strange that I should have heard nothing of the matter.” But aloud he only said—“Does her ladyship mention anything of Lord Arthur's whereabouts? I hope and in fact expected that he would have been here to-day? Does she mention him at all?” “Not a word, not a word about him,” replied Spencer. “Her ladyship is not, I fancy, the most anxious or affectionate of mothers! By heaven! I repique you, St. Maur, Yes, I repique you—three of my points! twelve for my four tierce majors? fourteen for my four aces! fourteen for my four kings! fourteen for my four queens! sixty for the repique! thirteen I gain on the cards in playing, and forty for the capot! a hundred and seventy in all. I never saw that stroke happen before. I doubt if it ever did! but it is just, I will bet ten to one. Will you bet, Harbottle? No? Well, good night!—it is late; good night.” CHAPTER VII. That same night there had been a gay and sumptuous ball in London, at the prime minister's. The king had himself honored it with his presence for an hour or two; and all that was gay and witty, great and beautiful, wise, noble, or in any way distinguished, had been assembled round the monarch's person. Nothing could possibly have been more brilliant in the shape of a fête, nothing at the same time more magnificent and merry. But the ball had come to an end, as all earthly pleasures will, even the purest and the most enduring; and once ended had left the heart full of bitterness and ashes, or at the best vacant and exhausted. The guests had departed to their homes, to abuse one another, and criticise, as it might be, the ostentation or the meanness of their entertainers. The crash of carriages and the din and quarrelling of drunken servants had subsided into stillness; the lights were extinguished in the ball-room; the flowers were fading on the wall; the tables were strewn with the relics of the splendid supper; and who was now the happier, for the wild gaiety, the lavish luxury, the vast expanse! In a large airy bed chamber situated in the corner of a stately house in Spring Gardens, the newly created marquis's, the Lady Fanny Asterly was sitting by an open window that overlooked the beautiful and quiet Thames, pensive and melancholy, and undressed, as if for bed; yet she sat there as she had sat for about an hour, and taken no thought of the time, nor dreamed of lying down since she dismissed her woman. That evening she had been the beauty of the ball-room, the admired of all men, the observed of all the observers. Adulations had flowed into her ears in one continuous stream of silvery music; homage the most devoted, attentions such as must gratify every female heart, even when those who tender them are but regarded lightly, had been paid her on all sides. Even the monarch had remarked her charms with an observant eye, and struck with her graceful manners and rare beauty, had desired that she should be presented to him. Beauty could have no greater triumph than Fanny Asterly's had met at that high festival. Nor, while the triumph lasted, had she been insensible to something akin to gratified ambition, to the high perilous excitement of successful vanity, and conscious superiority. Her cheek had flushed with a warmer and more bright carnation; her eye had beamed more exultingly than its wont, as she swam through the mazes of the voluptuous dance, the cynosure of every eye; and heard the stifled hum of admiration which followed her steps everywhere—that hushed and sincere applanse, paid by the heart to loveliness, which every woman understands, and to which she who is insensible, can scarcely be called woman. Greater or less it may be, but not genuine, very woman—not that sweet fascinating compound, whose very weakness is so far more adorable than any strength of mind or purpose; whose very virtues are so much made up from, and complicated with; those weaknesses, that you can scarcely destroy one without throwing down the other; whose very love of pleasing and thirst for admiration are perhaps half the secret of the pleasure which she inspires—the admiration which she wins from half reluctant reason. And Fanny Asterly was not insensible, nor yet ungratified—for she was indeed all woman—sweet, gentle, innocent, and amiable; yet in her every phase of thought, in her every fault, her every charm, a very, very woman. Yes! she had been pleased, delighted, almost intoxicated by the events of that evening; yet now, though she had not one thought or deed for which she could reproach herself with justice, it was with no sense of pleasure that she recurred to the events of the ball. She felt annoyed and angry with herself that she shoutd have been pleased and amused by such frivolous folly; she fancied that she had been guilty of a sort of half infidelity to Edward Hale, in suffering herself to listen to the flatteries, and to be pleased with the attentions of the young cavaliers of the court of James. “And this is his birth-day, too—this is the very day on which, one little year ago, he plighted me his faith, and we exchanged rings in the linden avenue at Asterly. Dear little ring—” and she raised her finger to her lips, and kissed the senseless gift of her lover's affection—“dear little ring, how I love you—how I wish that he were with me here who gave you to me a year since; and he, I doubt it not, he hath been thinking of me all this night; while I, false girl, have been listening and smiling, as if I had forgotten—but no! no! Edward, Edward—” she went on, becoming more excited as she gave vent to her feelings—“it is not so—it is not. I am true—true to you in my heart of hearts, Edward! There is not, in my most secret soul, dear Edward, one thought which I would hide from thee— one thought which I would hesitate to tell—one thought on which thou wouldst not smile thine approbation, even as, I doubt not, in thy spirit there is not one passing fancy which should raise a blush or call up a frown on my cheek or brow, did I know it.” Alas! for the pure confidence of innocentand guileless womanhood. Unsullied herself as the virgin snow, her heart and mind an unsoiled sheet, as it were, of parchment, until love had inscribed there one foundly cherished name, she never doubted that he on whom she had set the priceless jewel of her inestimable love was spotless as herself from any taint of voluptuous and sensual sin—nothing that she could have heard, scarce anything that she could have seen, were it not in his own handwriting, or from his own tongue, would have induced her to believe that at this very moment he was coveting if not loving the charms of another woman. Alas! alas! how does the boasted virtue of the most virtuous and moral of us men shrink into measureless vice, when compared with the purity, the trust, the truth of an innocent and loving woman. Edward Hale was no worse, nay, he was far less evil than the generality of young men of his age, at that, or perhaps at any day. Yet, troth-plighted as he was to that sweet girl, he dreamed not that he did her any wrong in dallying with other women, in winning their affections, in defrauding them of their virtues, so long as he preserved his own heart and his own affections in allegiance to her empire; and by a sophistry not uncommon, though most absurd and inconsistent, he justified himself in this breach both of purity and truth by saying to himself that by her father's decision a year was yet to pass before she could yet be his wife. And she, while his heart was afire with unholy passions for the betrothed wife of another, and his brain busy with intrigues whereby to work her ruin, she, in her exquisite purity of soul, was accusing herself of faithlessness, and almost weeping over her own imaginary delinquencies, because she had danced a few harmless dances, and listened to a few unmeaning compliments, and perhaps, at the most, endured a casual pressure of the hand from some gay coxcomb, whose attentions had no meaning beyond the present. But she was sad at heart—the excitement of the last hours had ceased, and the cold re-action had ensued, as is so frequently the case, more painfully than the bygone sensations had been pleasurable. She was sad, almost sick at heart. The moon was shining broadly into the tall French windows of her chamber, for she was near her full, and the skies were almost as light as at noonday, except when some great cloud came sweeping over the bright disc, and veiling everything for a few moments in clear and almost luminous obscurity, when compared to the darkness of a moonless midnight. And still she sat there watching the vast shadows creeping over the river's breast, and over the silent streets, and drawing fancied auguries from their strange forms and ghost-like movements. After awhile she pressed her hand on her heart and said, in low, mournful tones, “I know not what it is—I know not what ails me! I do wish that I had seen Serena this morning, or that I could see Arthur now—I have no reason, it is true, for any fear or apprehension—yet I do fear everything! Oh! how unhappy I am—oh! how unhappy? There seemed to fall a shadow on my heart, a chill upon my spirit, as I saw that Sir Henry Davenant pass by the window, with his bitter and sarcastic smile—and he has seemed to haunt me ever since! I met him twice when I was walking out this morning in the park, and both times he sneered at me with his horrid supercilious courtliness —and then, this evening at the ball, his cold snake-like eye was never withdrawn from my face for a moment; whenever I stopped in the dance, or turned my head from hearing some gay speech, I was sure to catch sight of him. He put me in mind of the skeleton the old Egyptians used to place at their banquets as a ghastly admonition. Whenever I beheld him, my heart stood still within me; and my blood seemed to run cold. Why can it be that I so loathe that man? Can it be, that the soul is prescient of its secret foes, and is inexplicably warned against those that shall work it woe?—No! no!—It cannot be—and yet—I do believe—I do—that he will one day injure me.” And she paused for a long time, and sat still, thinking deeply; but almost unconscious that she was thinking at all, so wildly and fantastically did her thoughts come and go; at last she gave a sort of start; and exclaimed,—“Yes! there is something going on—there is something wrong and evil plotting against us, I am sure. My mother—I observed my mother's eye many times to-day, fixed on me and not lovingly.—She does not love me!—and yet, my God, my God, what have I ever done, or failed to do, that she should not? She never loved me; never liked Edward! alas! alas! and my father, though kind, is not energetical.—Oh! Arthur, Arthur, my dear brother, why are you not here, why are you not at hand to help and comfort your unhappy sister?—She wrote to-day to St. Maur, and to Spencer, at his house at Arrington, and not one word to him! To Spencer—for what can she write to him; but for evil—evil, it must be evil! And oh! why will he associate himself with comrades such as Lord Henry, and this Captain Spencer, of whom no man or woman had ever yet one good word to say—whose very glance is poison!—Oh! Edward—Edward—did you but know—could you but know what agony it gives me.—But no! he knows it not—he cannot know it!—Nor can I send him word at all, nor even summon him to 6 town, unless my brother should come back!” For a few minutes she was again silent, but then rising from her chair suddenly, she fell down upon her knees, and prayed fervently and long; and her meek supplication finished, stood up refreshed and strengthened, and feeling something like a ray of heavenly consolation shining upon her heart. “Well, it is very late,” she said; “I will to-bed, to-bed! but, I fear, not to sleep!” and drawing the curtain over the window, through which the moonlight fell too brilliantly and full upon her couch, she walked across the room to reach something from a table, covered with books and drawings, and a few stands of flowers, before she lay down to rest. She had taken up the article, whatever it was, of which she was in search, and was in the act of turning away from the table, when her eye fell quite suddenly, and as if by accident, upon a neatly folded note, which she did not remember to have seen when she came into the room, on her return from the minister's ball. She took it up; it was unopened, and secured with a seal of red wax, bearing a deep impression, an antique head of Minerva. Thinking to herself that something must have been lying over it when she looked upon the table as she re-entered her room, she walked with the note to the window, in order to read it by the aid of the clear moonlight. Though she was very anxious, she knew not why, to arrive at the contents; and though she half prognosticated something of evil tidings, she yet, as we often do, even when we are the most impatient, turned it again and again, to examine the seal and superscription, and conjecture from whom it possibly could have come, when in all probability by opening it she would have learned the whole in a moment. Her hand literally shook as she broke the seal, and her eyes swam, as if dazzled by excess of light, so that some moments passed before she could fix the letters. At last, by a great effort, she composed herself, and read as follows: “One, who has seen and known the Lady Frances Asterly, almost from her cradle to the present day, although she knows him not, nor has ever seen him— who has watched her growth, daily, nay almost hourly, from the wild buoyant days of thoughtless infancy, through the sweet spring of girlhood, up to her present plenitude of glorious beauty—who has marked every growing charm both of mind and body—who has noted her fea tures, full of rare inborn music, her form ripe in most perfect loveliness—who has read her soul, and knows it to be pure and bright and spotless as the spirit of the new-born babe, fresh from the hands of the Creator—who loves her with an affection surpassing that of a father, because, unlike a father's, it is divested of all prejudice, and arises only from his sense of her exquisite and peerless beauty, beauty both of mind and body. One who, had he the means of altering his mission and changing his existence, would be her guardian spirit—one who has many times already stood, though she knew it not, between her and many an earthly peril— writes now once more to warn, and if possible to save her. Mark his words, innocent and lovely one, mark his words; and, although the task be a hard and bitter one, believe them and be warned. And oh! above all, fancy not that he who writes these lines, has any secret or unworthy object—that he is a resentful rival, a discarded suitor, an avenger of wrong done—” “For I am none of these. Before thou wert born I was old, wronged, and wretched. It was a fate, a wondrous fate, that interested me in thy birth, and it has been my fate ever to cross thy path, till I am, as it were, wound up in thy well being. I had a daughter once, innocent as thou art, and almost as beautiful—she heard, but would not heed my warning— she wedded, was deceived, lived wretched, and died young, young and heart-broken, as though wilt live, and die also, Fanny, if thou attend not this my warning. “He unto whom thy troth is plighted is not what thou deemest him, not what could make thee happy. Even now his house is full of revelry and riot, debauchery and—what it befits thee not to hear of. His friends and chosen comrades, the worst, the most notorious of the world's wicked devotees. Beware! beware! ere it shall be too late! “Be warned by my words, Fanny; but, even warned, I ask you not to act upon them, until convinced that they are true —true to the letter, or if lacking truth, lacking it only in that they come not up to the full measure of his wildness, his unworthiness, his falsehood. “Reject this warning, and you are lost for ever!” Eagerly she devoured every word of this strange wild epistle. She read it and re-read it, and in her own despite she felt that it had left a sting in her soul. It was in vain she said to herself, “Tush! it is but an ordinary slander! a vile thing composed by a wretch who dares not sign his name to the emanations of his own guilty mind.” It was in vain; she could not so banish it for there was something in the whole style and wording of the letter, in the antique and flowery phraseology, in the obscurity and mystery in which the writer was shrouded, in the dark sounding prophecies, and the strange emphasis of the warning, that made it obviously different from a commonplace anonymous letter. The character of Lady Fanny was naturally somewhat poetical and romantically inclined; and on this, doubtless, the writer had calculated in framing his artful and insidious missive. It happened, moreover, that the very tone of thoughts in which she was indulging herself at the time, harmonized singularly with the spirit of the letter, and of the warning it contained. She had been secretly deploring the connexion of her betrothed husband with the men whom she knew to be his companions at this moment; and lo! the letter spoke, not in dark hints, but in open language and spoke, as she believed truly, their characters in the world's estimation; and when the world does indeed condemn unanimously, it is rare that it condemns unjustly. Besides, did it not challenge investigation? Did it not recommend inquiry? It could not, therefore, be a mere baseless slander. Oh! of a truth it was very plausible! A very cunning spirit had devised that shaft, had steeped it in the very poisons which with a devilish foresight it knew would be the most likely to corrode and canker that pure heart; and a strong hand, and practised in the works of evil, when the unguarded moment had been duly chosen, sped it with sure aim to the mark, to rankle there, and blight the very soul of confidence. CHAPTER VIII. It was not until a late hour, late at least for those primitive days, that Edward Hale awoke on the morning following the revels of the first of May; and when he did awake it was with a fevered frame and an aching head. Some one or other, I forget who, has said that a man ought to get drunk every now and then for the sake of the serious thoughts, the earnest promises of reformation, and the very thorough process of remorse and repentance which he goes through on the morning succeeding to a hard debauch. Without entering into the morality of this question at all, or inquiring whether, even if the salutary effects be not overstated, a man ought to do ill that good may come of it, it cannot be disputed that the frame of mind in which a man is left on the subsidence of that violent excitement, conjoined with the discomfort of the body, is such as to lead him naturally to grave and serious reflection. And so it was, in this instance, with the young baronet. He was not by nature at all disinclined to calm, and, at times, almost solemn meditation; although the character of his reveries was for the most part rather imaginative and romantic than contemplative or moral. Although gay and joyous, and endowed largely with those high spirits which flow from youth and health, unchecked by present ills, or presages of future sorrow, he was rather of a poetical temperament, and that leads oftentimes to a reflective mood. This morning in particular, after he had arisen from his bed and dressed himself partially, he sent away his valet, and began to ponder seriously on the occurrences of the past day. As he sat in his armed chair, partially leaning on the sill of the open window, looking over the green meadow whereon still stood the tall May-pole, although the giddy crowd who had made all the space around it so gay on the preceding morning were now dispersed about their ordinary avocations, his thoughts reverted instantly to the beautiful queen of the May. At this calm season of the day, ere the sun had yet heated the earth, while the air came in fresh and dewy from the cool woods and grassy meadows, and fanned his brow with its fresh breath, the feverish excitements and hot passions of the past day seemed out of place, unhallowed, and distasteful. Better things were at work within him; better thoughts were aroused by the comparison involuntarily drawn between that innocent and tranquil daybreak, and the wild revel of the past night. He was a different man this morning, and the pictures which his mind conjured up before him of beautiful Rose Castleton, were not such as he had seen through the medium of glowing Burgundy. He thought not of her now, with her voluptuous figure swaying and bending in the dance, its every wavy line instinct with hidden passion; of her white bosom, all too much exposed by the disordered kerchie grow ing and throbbing in soft tumult; of her eyes now beaming bright with gratified ambition, now swelling, swimming, languishing in amorous dimness; of her sweet pouting lips; her balmy breath fluttering and panting between surprise and half offended modesty; of her honeyed kiss; of her rare form struggling in his embrace, and yet half willing to be detained, as he snatched the kiss from her lips, and the rose bud from her bosom; of the low, silvery, faltering voice in which she promised to meet him the next evening in the Monk's coppice! No! these were not the pictures which his fancy this morning set before him. Far, far from it. He saw her weeping, disconsolate, and pensive at her spinning wheel, in some such touching attitude as that wherein the great German painter has given a form and body to the rare spiritual Margaret of the great German poet.[1] [1] Retsch's Outline Illustrations of Goethe's Faust. He saw her with every vestige of color vanished from her wan cheek, every spark quenched in her bright eye; all the soft roundness of her lovely form wasted away and lost. He saw her kneeling at the village shrine with clasped hands and streaming eyes, while the stern fiend remorse was whispering in her ear to despair and die. He saw her prostrate at her grey-headed father's feet, clasping his knees and supplicating him to pardon his lost child—he saw the clenched hand, and the knitted brow, and the indignant eye of the relentless father, driving forth the dishonored girl, who had brought shame on his grey hairs—he saw the rude rout of the village, the coarse brutal rabble hooting the harlot through the long sunny street, and hallooing for the beadle and the ducking stool! He saw her by the still pool in the dark woodland, where the stream has no ripple on its surface, and the black waters tell of its unusual depth, kneeling and striving vainly to syllable a prayer for mercy before that awful plunge which should remove her, and for ever, from the cold sneers of the ruthless world! He saw her drawn out by the shuddering hands of superstitious rustics, cold, wan, dishevelled, dead—dead, by her own rash act— her own! say rather his! his whose false love had driven her to the brink of that abyss whose bottom is perdition! All this he saw, or seemed to see, in the delineations of his vivid fancy; he saw, and shuddered at the strength of his own imaginings. “And shall I,” he said to himself, half aloud, “shall I, for the poor gratification of a foul sensual passion, shall I do this thing? For a few hours, or a few days of fierce and fiery pleasure, shall I pollute so fair a temple, a temple reared by the hands of our common God and Father, to be the dwelling of as fair a spirit? shall I, for any temporal delight, perhaps consign her to eternal ruin? God forbid! God forbid!” and he stood up in the intensity of his feelings, for he had worked himself up to a state of considerable excitement, and walked for several minutes to and fro the room, strengthening his good resolves at every turn, and manning the fortress of his heart against the assaults of the Evil One, till he at last satisfied himself that he was again master of himself, that he could see and converse with the country beauty, without incurring any danger, or feeling any undue admiration of her charms; and finally he determined that with a magnanimity like that of Scipio, he would at once bring about her marriage with young Hunter, and give her the lease of the home farm for a dowry. This honorable resolution taken, well pleased with himself, conscious of honorable feelings, and proud of his own integrity, superior to its first very grave temptation, he sat down once again to reflect on the perfections of his legitimate lady love, and anticipate in imagination his future marriage with the charming Lady Fanny. For one whose whole life had been but one scene of success and pleasure, who had scarce known, as yet, the meaning of the word sorrow, so little had any touch of it come near to him, Edward Hale did truly and sincerely love Frances Asterly. It was not her beauty only, nor her sweet manners that had won him; but her heart, her mind—the purity and truthfulness of the one, the kind, affectionate, and cordial nature of the other! And when a man sets his love on the qualities of the intellect and of the heart—the qualities that are immortal and endure for ever in never fading and undying glory—and not upon the qualities of the poor body, that speedily are but as grass cut down and cast into the oven— small risk is there of his loving unworthily, or of his changing easily! For, in a word, so to love is a proof of character, higher than ordinary men possess, in the lover, and a guarantee for the existence of unusual qualifications in the object beloved. And, in both points, this was true of the present case; for Sir Edward Hale was, beyond doubt, a person of qualifications and mental character far above the standard average of men. It might be doubtful, hitherto, whether that character would turn our powerful for good or for evil in the end—whether those qualifications would serve to adorn and decorate a virtuous and honorable life, or to lend a false and meteorie splendor to an irregular and disorderly career; but there could be no doubt that, whichever way the wheel of his destinies should turn, in that course he would be found conspicuous and above his fellows, either in virtue or in vice. Thus far at least, the better spirit had prevailed; and, as he finished dressing himself, which he did unassisted by his valet, his heart was more at ease, and he was in truth both a happier and a better man than he had been on the previous morning; and it was with a gay and joyous exterior, covering a self-satisfied and tranquil confidence in his own good intentions, that he descended the grand staircase to join his companions in the breakfast parlor. Some short time, however, before he was ready to go down, he was not a little surprised to hear the sound of voices on the terrace below his windows; the rather as he knew of old that St. Maur was habitually a late riser—rarely displaying the glories of his well decorated person to profane and vulgar eyes until high noon—and he had no reason for suspecting that the gay captain was more matutinal than his friend. He looked out of the window, therefore, wondering who these could be that were astir already; and yet more to his surprise, he found that the very men whom he would almost have sworn had not yet turned themselves over to take their second nap, were walking to and fro upon the terrace, pausing every now and then, and talking earnestly in a low voice, as if they were unwilling that their words should be overheard. This Hale did not observe at the time, but afterwards events occurred which often led him to reflect on various things which passed that morning; and then he recollected this, and recollected, moreover, that when they first saw him leaning out of the window looking at them, there was a sort of consciousness if not embarrassment; about St. Maur's air and manner, indicating that he was, in some sort, the subject of their discourse. He did notice, however, and not without surprise, that they were both fully dressed, their periwigs arranged and powdered with careful nicety, and the whole of their attire showing, by its scrupulous precision, that they must have been on foot some hours, and that their toilets had been performed not negligently nor in haste. Hale waited for a moment without speak ing, until they came directly under his windows, when he dropped a rose-bud which chanced to be lying on the table— the same which he had snatched from the bosom of Rose Castleton in the evening— so that it fell immediately in front of St. Maur. He stooped to pick it up from the broad flag-stones that paved the terrace, and then cried, as he raised his eyes to the window, before seeing who it was— “By George! a fair challenge, be you who you may, sweet. Ah! you rogue, you rogue, Ned! so it is you, is it? I thought it had been some fair dame or damsel of whom my beaux yeux had made a conquest. This is a pretty disappointment! Your ugly phiz, in lieu of black eyes and cherry cheeks, and I know not what beside! The devil take you, Ned! the devil take you!” “Many thanks to you,” replied Hale, laughing, “for the warmth of your morning salutation, which I will not return. I have to crave your pardon, Captain Spencer, for playing such a sluggard part, as host, who ought to have been on foot to receive my guest. But it seems the mulled Burgundy made me a more sleepy night-cap than it did for you!” “You forget, you forget,” answered Spencer, “that St. Maur and I did not double the said night-cap quite so often as you did, and it sat in consequence less heavily on us; but pray don't think of apologizing; we have been amusing ourselves delightfully here this fine clear morning, looking about your magnificent old place.” “Thank you for saying so,” returned Hale, “but I fear you could have found little to amuse you; but I will dress myself in haste, and come down to you—will you be so kind in the meantime as to call for chocolate, and make yourselves quite at home? After breakfast we will see what we can do to kill the day. It is not a good time of the year for country sports, unless any of you are fishermen; there are fine trout in the river. But I fancy Mark can find us a heron or two, and I have a few cast of fine hawks, if you like to see a flight; coursing and hunting are of course out of the question; but I can give you some capital rabbit shooting in the fern of the upper deer-park.” “Oh! I have no doubt we shall do very well; but make haste, make haste, what we desire most is your company,” said the captain, but almost in the same breath, he added in a half whisper to St. Maur, “and as our desire will be gratified in a few moments, we must talk out our talk at once. What were you saying—oh, yes! about Harbottle—no, no! that will never do—he is not at all to be trusted in delicate matters like these. No, no! leave it to me, and my life on it, I arrange everything to your wishes. But after all I cannot guess, for my soul, why you are so wild to marry this penniless girl. It is true, I confess, that she is devilish handsome, and sprightly looking also; if she were some fellow's wife now, I could understand it; but to marry her—to marry her! Pshaw, pshaw! it is mere boy's play. If I were you I would let Hale marry her, nay, help him to her, and then take her from him; by the Lord, there is a great game to be played there.” “Hold, Spencer, hold!” St. Maur interrupted him, “you forget that you are talking of a girl whom I seriously intend to make my wife.” “Indeed I do not, my good fellow; I only wish to give you all the good advice I can beforehand; after she is your wife I shall remember it, you may be sure—unless indeed I should take a fancy to her myself—there is no saying what may happen, when men marry handsome wives; a friend's wife now is twice as good as an acquaintance's, and an acquaintance's as a stranger's!” “By heavens! Spencer, you are incorrigible; I should be hurt and angry with you, if I did not know that it is only your wild way of talking, and that you would not do the things you talk about to win the world!” “Oh no,” said Spencer, with a dubious smile, “not at all, not at all! only, as there is no saying what may happen, and as I hate treachery as I do the devil or the parson; only don't say, if anything should turn up, that I did not give you fair warning, Harry.” St. Maur looked at him for a minute or two steadily, as if to see whether he was in earnest, and then said, bursting into a light laugh— “You are a sad fellow, but I am not afraid of you. Well, go on, what is the whole of your scheme? let us be perfect in it.” “Why it seems that this old she devil has arranged all the preliminaries with pretty Fan already. She is to be made to believe Hale a perfect devil of licentiousness, and so break off the match with him; when you will have it all your own way; for there was never a man yet, who, backed by father and mother, could not win any girl's love at any time, when her fancy is disengaged, unless he is a greater fool than I take you to be. Then she will be piqued and her vanity wounded in this case, which will make it easier yet for you; and if, as you say, she does dislike you now, that does not hurt your chance a straw's value; for my own part, when I want to win a woman, next to her loving me beforehand, I would choose to have her hate me! Nothing is so difficult to deal with as indifference—for they always go by contraries and extremes—women do, I mean, Harry; and so if they begin by hating you, and thinking you a fiend of darkness, they are pretty sure to adore you in six weeks, and discover that you are an angel of light.” “Yes, yes! that is all very fine—one of your wiredrawn theories that come to nothing! However, I do not doubt but I can win her easily enough if we can set her against Hale.” “Well, that is easily done enough, I am sure. Why here is luck playing into your very hand. The old woman has laid the foundation of distrust in her daughter's heart already; and here is this young baby half wild now after this country girl—who by the way is pretty enough to make a wiser man wild. My only fear was that she would be too willing. But I have taken care of that—she will not meet him to-night, and that will whet his appetite; then you must play your own part—extol her beauty, feed his passion as much as you can; and I will sneer at him—we will bet high on his success, you for and I against it! I saw at a glimpse that game-keeper was a rogue, and I have bought him; he will help us through anything. Then I have sent for my lieutenant and a press gang to be here to-morrow, and we will screw him up to-night to sign an order to have Hunter pressed. It is a devil of a stretch I know; but we who serve King Jamie to the utmost, know how to stretch a commission without cracking it; and we will have him carry off the girl, and so arrange things that it shall all come our directly; and so he will be disgraced in the eyes of all good people, and dished with lady Fan.” “Yes, that will do, if we can accomplish it.” “If, if!—to the devil with your ifs!—I tell you it is half accomplished now. I should not at all wonder, if he have half repented of his wicked wishes this fine morning, now that he is maudlin—your maudlin state is a great virtue breeder! But I have laid a trap for him that will set his tinder in a blaze presently. Do you but play your part well, and talk all day of her charms, and try to make him jealous of that fool Harbottle, who is I think smitten a little with the wench already— get him to show that if you can—and now, do not forget to write to Delaval, as I told you, expressing your surprise at finding Hale, as he had hinted to you, such a wild rake and jolly fellow. Invent, invent! describe his harems and his orgies! Draw, draw upon imagination, or if that fail you, look to the Arabian Nights! But hark you, all in your proper character, —reckless and rash—no sermonizing, or you will spoil all. Do you understand?” “Yes, to be sure; it will be shown—” “To her cousin, Lady Serena Fortescue, who will tell her so, that she shall never doubt the channel. I, too, will write to Davenant, in a quite different strain, but to the same effect. I only wish I could have got him to commit some outrage or indecency before that puritanical old beast and idiot, Rochefort; that would have set him talking.” At this moment Sir Edward appeared coming down the steps from the front door to join them; and at the same time Eversley passed them going to meet his master, with a beantiful black greyhound bitch following at his heel, and a large bunch of violets in his hand. “Ha! Master Keeper,” exclaimed Spencer, as the man went by; “what's in the wind now?” and he spoke loud, on purpose that Hale might hear him; and then, as Eversley turned round to answer him, he went on—“By George! what a posy thou hast got there! Here, give it to me, man, give it to me, and take this guinea in exchange, for I am mortal fond of posies.” “Excuse me, Captain Spencer,” said the fellow, grinning and pocketing the guinea which the sailor flung to him; “excuse me, for I would give it willingly if it was mine, which it is not; it is a present I am carrying to master.” “What's all this? what's all this?” said the young Lord of the Manor, laughing. “Why don't you give Capt. Spencer the flowers, Mark?” “Nay, nay, Sir Edward, she that gave them to me desired me to put them in your own hand, and by the same token she sent a message, too.” “She! she!” exclaimed St. Maur; “Spencer, I'll bet you a rouleau I can put a name to the she!” “Done! done!” replied the captain; “done, that you cannot put the right one. Whisper it now to me, and we will leave it to his honor afterwards.” “Well, then, I say Rose Castleton,” replied St. Maur, in what was meant to pass for a whisper, although it reached Ed ward's ears as plainly as if it had been uttered in a shout. “I bide my bet,” said Spencer in the same sort of whisper; “I shall win it too; that girl is not to be won so easily—he will never win her! But come,” he added, now speaking in his natural tones, “come; Mercury, it seems, will not deliver his message in the presence of the assembled gods, but keeps it for the private ear of Jove. Let us leave them”—and they moved off a little way, out of ear-shot, although they watched every movement of the parties. They saw the hot blood mount crimson to the fair brow of the young man as he received the nosegay and the message; but it was evident that his face reddened not with anger, for his eye sparkled and there was a smile upon his lip as he asked several questions, to all of which he got prompt answers from the keeper, who had been primed already for his part by the wily plotters, and now played it to perfection. The conference did not last above five minutes when Hale turned away, saying— “Be in the way, after breakfast; for we will either shoot, or see those new merlins fly. Canst find us a heron-shaw this fine morning?” “I'll warrant you, Sir Edward?” “Well, we will see anon. Now let us go to breakfast, gentleman. I think a broiled turkey's gizzard will suit my stomach to a turn this morning, for, to speak truth, I do feel a little squeamish after the Burgundy. But where is Harbottle? Has nobody seen Harbottle? Run, Mark, and send some one to call Mr. Harbottle to breakfast.” “But in the meantime, baronet,” said Spencer, “touching this bouquet, of which I see you think so well you are wearing it next to you heart; will you decide our bet, upon your honor?” “Is it correct to do so, Captain, when it concerns a woman?” “No, if it be a lady—yes! if a country girl, Sir Edward.” “I believe you are in the right; the rather that she seems to me rather a light o' love. How stands your bet?” “St. Maur bets that it was Rose Castleton that sent you the violets. I hold the opposite.” “St. Maur has won, captain, it was she!” “There, Spencer, there,” cried the young lord triumphantly, “unbuckle, sailor man, unbuckle your fat legs; out with the rouleau.” Spencer pulled out his purse, and with apparent reluctance handed to him the sum which he had lost, saying, as he did so, “I must look out for Percy Harbottle, now for you dare not stand the other bet, St. Maur.” “What other bet? what other bet, Captain Spencer?” answered Lord Henry with well feigned eagerness, and a little show of anger. “I do not like such remarks as these! I stand any bet that any man dare stand, at least if I see a possibility of winning it. What bet is it you mean?” “That he wins her,” answered Spencer, “that he wins the girl in any reasonable time; you dare not bet that, St. Maur; but it does not come within your category— there is no possibility of your winning it.” “I will, though, I will!” exclaimed St. Maur; “I will bet a cool thousand that he has her living with him as his mistress in a fortnight.” “A cool thousand! done! I shall win that,” said the captain confidently. They had been all walking together towards the house, while this conversation, if conversation it can be called, was going forward; but now Sir Edward stopped short, piqued not a little at the sort of undervaluing way in which Spencer spoke of his chances with the girl, and trying to laugh, but evidently a little mortified— “And why do you think so, Captain Spencer? Have you so vast an idea of the girl's virtue?” “Why, I had rather you would pardon me. I was in the wrong to speak as I did; I would rather you would ask me no more.” “No, no; speak out. You have said too much, or too little. I insist on it, that you let us have the whole. Do you think her impregnable!” “Oh dear, no! Far from it, She is willing enough, any one can see. But you will excuse me, Sir Edward, I have some experience in these matters, and I do not think you are the man.” “Who then? yourself, perhaps, captain?” replied Hale, still more piqued by his answer, although perfectly good humored. “Oh, no! not myself, upon my word! though I should like very well to have the wench in London for a month or so, for she is a devilish handsome woman, that is certain; and her slim round figure would show admirably well in a mazarine blue riding-dress of the last mode, slashed with gold colored brocade. By heaven! I think I can see her now, reming that strawberry roan Spanish jenet of mine through the Parks. Heavens! St. Maur, how she would catch men's eyes. It would be a year's renown to return to London as her protector. But I beg your pardon, Sir Edward, for wandering from your question; no! I assure you on my honor, that I had not myself in mind at all, when I spoke. No! I think Percy Harbottle a likelier man. I saw her look at him out of the corners of those large languishing eyes of hers, two or three times while you were dancing with her.” “Perhaps you would like, captain,” replied Hale, assuming a tranquillity which he did not feel, “perhaps you will like to bet that she will be Harbottle's mistress in a week, and not mine, for I intend to try all means to make her mine.” “Of course you do,” said St. Maur; “nobody doubted that—nobody, at least, who knows you. With the encouragement you have had, you would be a precions ninny if you did not. Of course you will try, and succeed, too. I'll be sworn of it.” “I cannot bet that she will be Harbottle's mistress, for I don't know at all that he is thinking about her. I would bet—but no, no! baronet,” he interrupted himself, “I am your guest, and I don't wish to win your money. Besides, it is my jesting that has put you up to the notion. It would not be fair.” “To the notion of what?” asked Hale, very quickly, “put me up to the notion of what!” “Of courting this girl, to be sure,” answered Spencer. “But let us say no more about it. Come, let us go to breakfast.” “You forget that I told you yesterday at Barnsley that my eye was upon her— you forget—” “Yes, to be sure he does,” interrupted St. Maur, “or rather he pretends to forget, to get off betting. He knows as well as we do that you will win her.” “I know nothing of the sort! I know that he will not.” “Once again, will you bet?” said Sir Edward, who was growing almost angry. “If you insist upon it, yes.” “I say, then, that I will have her openly as my mistress within one week from this day.” “I understand you perfectly, and take the converse. For how much?” “For anything you please, from one to five thousand.” “Oh! one—one is enough; for one thousand be it. It is a bet!” “Very well, there is an end of that— then let us go to breakfast; and here comes Percy Harbottle,” and he took several quick steps forward in advance of the rest, to greet him. As he did so Spencer fell back to St. Maur a pace or two, and whispered in his ear— “You stand my lose to him, if I should lose the bet; as it is most likely that I shall.” “Yes, yes! I understand it so,” said the other, “but come on quickly, or he will see us whispering together, and suspect something.” And overtaking him, they all walked on together, and entered the breakfast room, joking and laughing merrily. CHAPTER IX. Breakfast passed joyously and gaily, no more allusions were made to the bets, Spencer carefully avoiding the subject, as if he thought that he might give offence by continuing it; but St. Maur and Harbottle continued to expatiate upon the charms of Rose Castleton, the felicity of the man who should have the luck to gain her, and the certainty of its giving him the greatest eclat of any one in London, to produce her in the parks, or at the theatre, as a part of his menage. As soon as breakfast was over, while St. Maur and Spencer excused themselves for the purpose of writing a few letters, Edward with Percy Harbottle walked round the grounds, and visited the stalls, and the kennels, and the mews of the falcons; and finally set to amusing themselves by making the grooms ride the hunters in succession backward and forward over a high leaping bar. While thus employed they were joined by the others, and the question was put, how the day was to be spent, until dinner time. “Oh! confound dinner!” replied Spencer; “I hate your regular two o'clock dinner, it so thoroughly breaks up the day. Let us go out and hawk or shoot, if Sir Edward likes my plan, all day; taking some ale and cold meat with us, and come home to a good early supper, and we will have another bout at the Burgundy. What say you, worthy host of mine?” “That is a bright thought, and a right good plan,” answered Hale. “I am like you; I hate your ceremonious dinner so early in the day, and I love your extemporaneous sylvan meal on the green turf, under the shady trees, or beside some clear and bubbling runnel.” “Yes,” answered St. Maur, “or in some jolly farmer's house, with his pretty daughter to pour out the ale, and kiss you behind the door, when the father is looking the other way.” A loud laugh followed this characteristic speech; and then they began to inquire what should be the order of the day, and it was speedily decided that they would shoot rabbits in the park, in preference to hawking in the meadows, or fishing in the stream—and Eversley being called in to name a farm-house situated conveniently for taking the mid-day meal, suggested, not altogether unexpectedly to Edward Hale, nor without having pocketed beforehand a handsome fee for his advice, suggested farmer Castleton's. “Ha! ha! Then we shall see the pretty Rose again—hey, Ned?” said St. Maur. “And Percy Harbottle will have a chance of entering the lists, if he will,” said Spencer. “No, no!” replied Harbottle, “every lad to his own lass. I stick to my promise; he gave me a good chance with a pretty girl yesterday, and hang me if I cross him to-day.” In a few moments they were all equipped, and ready for the sport, accompanied by servants with hunting-poles to beat the bushes, and spaniels to start the game, and boys with spare ammunition, and all means and appliances for a blithe day's sport. Taking their way across the trout stream, and through the dense oak grove, they crossed the tall castle hill, and going out by a postern in the brick wall of the park, entered a deep and hollow road, between high banks of sand, crested on either hand by the walls of the home park and the deer-park—and overshadowed by the rich foliage of the huge oaks, which almost crossed their branches overhead, and made the lane at noonday almost as, dark as midnight. A second postern, at a short distance up the lane, gave access to the deer-park—a wild tract of barren broken land, with many gulleys and ravines, each watered by its gushing streamlet, each clothed with feathery brushwood and tall fern, among which the grey burrowers they came in pursuit of squatted by hundreds. At a short distance from the double portions, they caught a glimpse, as they crossed the road, of a large rambling brick farm-house, with tall fantastic pinnacles, and the twisted chimneys of the Elizabethan style, peering from out the shade of the dark oaks, and abutting on the deer-park wall. “There is the home farm,” said the keeper—“old Castleton's, you know, Sir Edward; I sent the boys up with the wine, and word we would be there at two hours past noon; and he says, if you please, Sir Edward, he will be very blithe to see you, and they will have the goose pie ready.” “A capital thing, too, is a good goose pie,” said Hale, “and we will find appetites conformable, I'll warrant it. Now, give me my gun, for here we are upon the ground, and so let loose the spaniels. Are they steady, Mark?” “No steadier in England, your honor,” answered the keeper, “than the two black King Charles! they are worth fifty guineas any day, of any gentleman's gold! I'll be judged by these gentlemen if they be not—although I say it who should not, seeing it was I who broke them.” The game was abundant, the day prosperous, the young marksmen in good cue; the dogs behaved well, the shooting was extremely good, and the sport undeniable, for above a hundred rabbits had been bagged by the three guns before the hour indicated for their rustic dinner was announced, by the long keen blast of a bugle, strongly and scientifically winded, from the porch of the neighboring farm-house. “There goes old Castleton,” cried Hale, “he was the huntsman to my father's pack, many years since! That says that the goose pie is ready.” Leaving the brakes wherein they had been shooting, a short walk brought them to the well stocked and hospitable farm-house, where blunt old fashioned English hospitality received them, with its cheery and unceremonious welcome. The goose pie was pronounced excellent, and such justice done to it as showed the praise was sincere; the home-brewed ale as clear as amber, as mild as milk, and almost as strong as brandy, was duly honored; and, above all, as Edward expected, lovely Rose Castleton was there—looking, he thought even lovelier than before, in her tight fitting russet jacket, and short blue petticoat, with her beautiful round arms bare nearly to the shoulder, and her trim shapely ankles, displayed by her brief draperies. There was, however, something in Rose's manner that Hale did not understand; she would not talk much to him, nor jest at all; yet many a stolen glance met his—now dwelling boldly, now as coquettishly averted; still he could not exactly make it out, until, as her father turned aside to speak to St. Maur, she cast her eye quickly towards the old man, and laid her finger on her lips. Frank Hunter, with the wonted indiscretion of men and lovers, under such circumstances, had been to see her that morning; and, like a fool as he was, instead of coaxing, had reproached and harassed her; and, concluding by calling for her father's interposition, had procured her a sound seolding, in set terms, for her flirtiness and vanity in fancying that a gentleman like Sir Edward would demean himself so much as to look at her. In truth, between the fascinations of the young lord of the manor, the sulky and unflattering resentment of her lover, and the most injudicious violence of her father, who really had not the least suspicion that Hale was thinking about his daughter, and fancied that it was merely an absurd whim of the girl's, to tease Frank Hunter—in truth, Rose Castleton was in dread peril of going irretrievably astray. Nothing of any moment passed; nor could Sir Edward find any opportunity of speaking to the poor girl alone until when the dinner was finished, and they were returning to their sports; after they had all quitted the house with the old farmer, he made a plea of having left his shot pouch, and ran back himself, before any one could anticipate him, to fetch it. He found, as he expected, Rose Castleton alone, looking out of the window after them. As he entered the garden gate she looked round, and seeing the shot bag, guessed, with a woman's rapid wit, what it meant—caught it up, and stepped out into the porch to meet him. There were two servant girls removing the dinner things in the hall, and, as if accidentally, she pulled the heavy door to after her. The porch was deep and projecting, and, as Hale entered it, he cast a quick glance round to see if he was observed, but all was safe! The very air of Rose, her heighteued color, the quickened motion of her bosom, and the trembling of her small hand, showed that she was not all unconscious. “I thank you, Rose,” he said quite aloud, in order to be overheard; “that is just what I came back for.” But, with the words, he caught her round the waist with both his arms, and pressed her soft and panting bosom to his own—took one long kiss from her unreluctant lips, and whispered, “You will come, Rose, you will come, dearest Rose, to-night?” “Be sure I will,” she replied—“if they will let me—if I can slip away; but— but,” she added, with an arch smile, “you must promise that you will not harm me.” Before he could reply, however, the old man's step was heard without; and putting her fingers up to her rosy lips, and blowing him a kiss, she vanished. The door clapped heavily, and, making as if it had closed on his own exit, Edward walked out with the pouch in his hand, spoke a few words to the old man, and hurried on to join his comrades. They returned to their sport,—but the mind of Edward was too much engrossed by other matters; his heart beat thick and fast—his head was unsteady—he missed four or five fair shots in succession; and his friends laughed at him; but he bore all their jeering in good part, and laughed in his turn, at them, as he told them that “He laughed the loudest who laughed last!” “Look out,” he added, “look out for your thousand, captain!” “Ha! is it so?” said Spencer, “has she made an appointment?” “For nine o'clock to-night!” “Hurrah!” cried St. Maur. “Hurrah! we shall do the captain—I knew we should. Halloa! there goes a rabbit, right from between my legs!” and he took a quick sight and fired. Their shooting was continued until the shades of evening had begun fairly to set in; and then, with their shooting ponies fairly laden with the quantity of game they had shot, their dogs almost tired out, and themselves in the highest possible spirits, they returned homeward to supper, Just as they came in sight of the house, the first bell was ringing out clearly and merrily, so that there was little time to spare before the social meal should be set on the board—and this little Captain Spencer, determined that Edward should have no more time for quiet consideration, contrived to make still less, by detaining him some minutes on the steps of the hall door, in frivolous conversation. Then starting suddenly, as if he had forgotten himself, he said—“Upon my word! we shall scarce have five minutes to make our ablutions. Now, pray, lose no time, my dear Sir Edward, for I am perilous hungry.” “Not I, faith,” answered the baronet, running up stairs in high glee—“I will be with you in five minutes.” Then Spencer turned round, with a quiet smile, to St. Maur, and said— “The game is won!—that is to say, if you have not made any blunder in your letter to Delaval. I wish I had found time to see it before you sent it off. Mine to Davenant was a master-piece! Not a word that could be contradicted; yet not a word that might not be construed into anything.” “I think, for my part, that the game is lost! Here is this silly wench going to meet him quietly to-night. He wins her almost without wooing—wearies of her as soon as she is won—and there's an end of the whole thing, and no one the wiser.” “That is all you know about it! and, true enough, that is all that would come of it, if there were no head wiser than your own to arrange it.” “How is it, then? How—” “Never you mind. It is all well, that is enough for you. Go away now, and prepare yourself for supper.” It was not twenty minutes before to the light-hearted sports of the day the excitement of the lighted hall succeeded—the sumptuous supper—the rich and genial wines—the frolic mirth—the graceful revelry—the voluptuous song—the licentious boasting. Now there was nothing of the gross and low debauchery which had rendered the orgies of the past night disgusting to every refined and gentle spirit; now there was nothing coarse or boisterous or obscene; wine flowed, it is true, liberally, but not to excess; now there was present everything that could excite and stimulate, and nothing that could jar upon or disgust the senses. So passed the evening, until the hour drew nigh for the host's appointment, and then, easily excused, Sir Edward stole away to the rendezvous in the low Monk's Coppice. That night, although they waited for him, and revelled late, his friends saw nothing of their host; and when, two hours past midnight, they adjourned, they were informed by the house-steward that Sir Edward, not being well at ease, had been a-bed these four hours. “I told you so,” whispered Spencer, “I told you he would not get her very easily. Good night! good night! to-morrow will play out the game.” The morrow came, and when the party were assembled at the breakfast table, the brow of Edward Hale was so dark and moody, that from this alone it was evident he must have been disappointed; but this it did not suit his guests to perceive, and as soon as he entered the apartment, St. Maur, who was awaiting him, cried out, with a merry laugh— “Why this is the very insolence of conquest, Ned. They tell me that you were abed at ten o'clock; was not the lovely Rose worth one hour's attention?” “Tush!” answered the young baronet, sharply; “damnation on it! she did not come at all. Instead of Rose, I met that great brute, Mark Eversley, at the place, to tell me she was watched, and could not get out to meet me. And now, to wind up the whole, her old dotard of a father has been here, as soon as it was light this morning, with Frank Hunter, to ask my sanction for her marriage, on the day after to-morrow. He did not directly tell me so, but it is quite clear that she had told him everything, for he talked about a love-quarrel with her betrothed husband, and her flightiness, and coquetting with some other man to punish him! And how sorry she was now, and how much she repented of her misconduct, and how willing Frank was to forgive her, and how anxious he was himself to marry her at once to the man she loved, lest scandal, and perhaps worse should come of it.” “Pshaw! pshaw! that is the merest humbug. They have found you out somehow or other, and have been badgering the girl out of her wits. It is as clear as daylight that she loves you, and would rather be your mistress than that bumpkin's wife. Only do not despair, and you shall have her yet.” “No, no!” replied Hale, bitterly, “no —St. Maur—no! it is impossible. By all the powers of hell! she is lost to me altogether, and for ever; and I—I—by the Lord that lives! I would give half my fortune, half my life to win her.” “Nonsense, man, nonsense,” replied St. Maur, “why the deuce should she be lost to you! It will never do to give it up thus. Why Spencer will win our two thousand guineas; I suppose that does not signify to you, who are as rich as Crœsus, but it is everything to me, who have not been a minor eighteen years, with ten thousand pounds per annum to accumulate.” “Why, what the devil would you have me do, man?” answered Sir Edward, angrily; “I tell you I would give ten thousand pounds to win her.” “Then why don't you win her, baronet?” said Speneer, laughing. “I could do it, for a twentieth part of the sum.” “Oh, you mean buy her, I suppose; buy her of the father, or the bridegroom! But you would be very much mistaken if you were to try that game. You would be pretty sure to get your head broken with a quarter-staff for your pains.” “Indeed, I mean nothing of the kind,” said he; “but I could do it.” “How? how? I will do anything— anything in the world to win her.” “You forget, baronet, that I have bet against you; and it is hardly likely that I should help you to win my own money.” “Oh, I have lost the bet; I have lost the bet fairly, for I have consented to her marrying Hunter,” replied Edward. “I had given up all hopes of success, and, indeed, had filled up a draft in your name on my goldsmith, before I came down stairs; here it is, Captain Spencer. Now we are straight on that score. So you are free to help me now. How would you win her?” “Why, by a little gentle violence. Carry her off, to be sure,” answered Spencer, pocketing the draft. “More easily said, that, than done!” answered Hale. “Oh, you are young—you are young,” replied the other. “Give me the necessary orders, and I will arrange it all for you in the twinkling of an eye.” “I will give you anything you please, captain,” answered the baronet, very quickly, “if you will show me how you can do it” “Well, just sit down at that table. You are a magistrate, are you not?” “Yes; what of that?” “Everything—everything! Just sit down, and write me an order to take in charge Francis Hunter, as a poacher, or vagabond, or anything you please, and to put him on board my frigate—and I will do it this very night—if I take him out of his own house.” “But how will you get the force?” “Never you mind. I have got force nearer than you think for. My frigate lies in the Southampton river, and perhaps my heutenant and a gang are nearer at hand than she is. Perhaps I brought them hither with a view to some fun for myself; you need not inquire. In these times the king's very good friends, as I am, can do a great many very funny things. Only do you give me the order, and tell me where to catch Master Frank, and he shall find himself to-morrow night under hatches of the good ship Royal Oak, instead of being under a coverlet with a bonny bride. And, if he needs must be married, my boatswain shall be parson, and tie him up to the gunner's daughter. A saucy scoundrel, to interfere thus with his betters.” “That is soon done,” said Hale, who was now thoroughly maddened between passion, rivalry, and disappointment, “that is soon done,” and with the words he drew an order, signed it, and gave it to Spencer; “and for the rest, there is no difficulty in getting hold of Hunter. He told me himself that he should ride to Alresford this evening, to buy the wedding ring, or some such foolery, and return homeward by the forest road ere midnight; I will show you where you may post your men, and catch him—and what then?” “Why, then, you shall ride out with me, and show me the spot; and then go on and call to pay your respects on the good Earl of Rochefort; and, if he press you, stay dinner with him. Then you must let Mark Eversley show St. Maur which is the window of the girl's bedchamber, and he must have the carriage waiting in some safe place by the park wall, and carry off the girl for you, and the seandal of that will fall on him, not on you; and he has earned so good a repntation for such deeds, that one more or less will make no difference to him; and as for Hunter, I will not post my men until sunset, and when the job is done will return quietly to the Hall, and no one will be a word the wiser, until a three years' cruise is over, and by that time the whole thing will be forgotten.” “Excellent! excellent!” exclaimed Sir Edward. “And as I return from, Rochefort's, I will meet St. Maur in the carriage, have a sham quarrel with him, and bring her back to her father's as her rescuer.” “And so secure a two-hour's tête-à-tête with her in the first place, in which, of course, you can overcome all her scruples, if she have any, and win her for your mistress under her father's very nose; and that, too, with his everlasting gratitude to you for saving her from this vile profligate. Ah! you are a cunning fellow, Hale; and, before many years, will be as deep a hand as myself, I warrant, you.” It needed little time to arrange all their schemes of iniquity, in due form, and with every probability of success; and then, when all was planned, St. Maur and Harbottle set out to fish the stream; while Spencer and the young lord of the manor rode out together, the former, as he gave it out, to carry letters to the post at Barnsley, the latter to pay his respects to the Earl of Rochefort; but it was a matter of some little surprise to the household that they took no attendants with them, and that they ordered a late supper, saying that they should neither of them be home until near midnight. CHAPTER X. Throughout that day everything went on well for the conspirators: Spencer had reconnoitred the ground thoroughly, as he rode out with his friend in the morning; had found his lieutenant with the men, as he expected, at Barnsley; and had given them his instructions so skilfully that he felt well assured no suspicion could in any case fall upon him as the perpetrator of the meditated ontrage, until he should himself choose to reveal his agency in the matter. Meanwhile, Sir Edward Hale had galloped onward, without giving his mind time to cool from the turmoil of fierce passion which was still raging there, to Kings ton castle, the seat of the Earl of Rochefort; and there, too, everything had happened to his liking, for shortly after his arrival a furious thunder-storm arose, and lasted so long that he was pressed, as he desired to be, to stay for dinner, and no plea was left him for refusing the kindly and oft-urged invitation. Thus passed the day, unmarked by anything of moment, and night came on untimely for the season, and boisterons, and unpleasant, and in all respects suited to the purposes of the conspirators. Few men were likely to be abroad on such a night, if it were not on urgent business; for it had been a dim grey misty evening since the thunder-storm, with every now and then a violent burst of cold and wintry rain; the wind howled fearfully among the tree-tops, and the chimneys of the manor, and it was withal so dark and black, that long before midnight a man could not have seen his hand at a yard before his face. This storm had afforded Spencer a fair excuse for dining at the little Inn at Barnsley; while his men went off singly, or in small parties so as to pass unnoticed, to rendezvous at a well known and conspicuous landmark, the Battle Pillar, as it was called, a large block of grey granite, commemorative of some event long since forgotten, standing, by the wayside, on a large waste common covered with fern and bushes, and interspersed with pools and pits full of water, where they were to be joined by their officers in the course of the night, and receive further orders. Hale had, however, some difficulty in escaping from the hospitalities of the castle, in consequence of the unusual inclemency of the night; and it was only by alleging the presence of his guests at home, as an insurmountable obstacle to his remaining all night, that he was enabled to avoid the well meant persecutions of the old lord. After that, he had another struggle to undergo, before he could get away without accepting the escort of a half a dozen of the earl's blue coated serving men, whom it would have very ill-suited him to take along with him that night; but finally, when it was nearly ten o'clock, he succeeded in making good his retreat, and began to ride rapidly towards the place appointed. Eleven o'clock struck from many a village steeple, and quarter elapsod after quarter, and now it was almost on the stroke of twelve, and all things were prepared for action—a carriage, one of the lightest of the ponderous vehicles of that day, with four strong horses harnessed to it, stood in a hollow way close to the postern gate in the park wall, sheltered from observation by the dense shadows of the overhanging trees, ready to bear off Rose to London so soon as she should be seized by the ruffians appointed for that task under the orders of Lord Henry St. Maur. Meantime the gang of sailors, well armed, with bludgeons, pistols, and cutlasses, lay hid in the dark thickets by the side of the Alresford road, with Captain Spencer and his first lientenant; while guarded by three men, in a low charcoal burner's shed, long since deserted, on the skirts of the forestland, and scarcely half a mile distant, a light taxed cart, with two swift horses attached to it, tandem-fashion, was in waiting to bear the captured yeoman to his floating prison. The times had been calculated closely— and all, so far, had gone successfully. Frank Hunter was even now jogging homeward, as the leaders of the press-gang anticipated, with a full purse and happy heart, from the distant market-town; and now Lord Henry, with his ruffians, was actually at his post by the lonely farm, and consulting his repeater ere he should give the word to plant the ladder against the chamber window of the innocent girl, who slept, all unsuspicious and unconscions, the calm, soft sleep of youthful happiness. Sir Edward Hale, however, was ill at ease and anxious; he was too young in evil—he had too much of actual goodness in his composition—was too unhardened in the road of siu, not to feel many a twinge of conscience, many a keen compunctious visitation. He, too, was now near the place of action—he had already ridden many miles since leaving the castle, where he had spent the day; and his heart, fearfully agitated, began to turn almost sick within him, as he was now rapidly approaching the point on the great London road whereat, an hour or two later, he was to meet the carriage bearing his destined mistress from her terrified and grieving family. He had, as I have said already, felt full many a prick of conscience, full many a touch of half repentant sorrow; but still, whenever he made up his mind to turn from the evil of the way in which he was going, as he did many times that night, dread—that false dread which so often drives frail man to crime and sorrow— dread, I mean, of the mockery and langhter of his more hardened comrades, prevailed, and hindered him from turning his head homeward, and countermanding the preparation of those base outrages. Still, though he dared not halt in the career of sin—though he felt that he could not, even though he would, repent—he was sad, moody, and reluctant; and he rode onward slowly, guiding his horse with an irresolute and feeble hand through the blind darkness. He was now two or three miles only distant from the station at the cross-roads, which had been fixed upon as the spot where he was to overtake the carriage, and enact the part of Rose's rescuer from St. Maur and his myrmidons. He was just in the act of crossing the bridle-road which led from the market-town, when Hunter was returning, past the wild forest-land skirting his own park, wherein the press-gang was patiently awaiting the appearance of the young yeoman. The London road, after it crossed the narrow track in question, mounted the brow of a short bold hill, and dived at once into a deep and shadowy dingle, with a large brook, which had been swollen by that night's rain into a wild and foaming torrent, threading the bottom of the dell. The brook, which lay between the rocky banks, was spanned at this place by a rude wooden bridge, that had, for some time past, been gradually falling into ruin; and scarce two hours before the time at which Sir Edward reached the spot, the whole of the weak fabric had been swept away by the swollen torrent. At the cross road the youthful baronet paused, even longer than before, and doubted—yes, greatly doubted—whether he should not alter, even now, his purpose; but, as he did so, the distant clatter of a hoof came down the horse-road from the direction of Alresford—and, instantly suspecting that the traveller could be no other than Frank Hunter, he dashed his spurs into his horse's side, and galloped furiously across the hill, and down the steep descent, towards the yawning chasm, fearful of being seen, under these circumstances, by the man on whom he was preparing to inflict an injury so fearful. Down the steep track he drove furiously —headlong—spurring his noble hunter— on! on! as if he were careering in full flight—flight from that fearful fury, a self-tormenting conscience; which; to borrow the imagery of the Latin lyrist—“Climbs to the deck of the brazen galley, and mounts on the croupe of the flying horseman!” On he came! on! Now he was at the brink of the dread precipice! One other bound would have precipitated horse and man together into the dark abyss! But the horse bounded not; he saw, almost too late, the frightful space, and stood with his feet rooted to the verge, stock still, even as a sculptured image! stock still from his furious gallop, even at the chasm's brink! Headlong was Edward Hale launched by the shock into the flooded stream; and well was it for him that the stream was so wildly flooded; for had he fallen on the rocks, which in ordinary weather lay bare and black in the channel, he had been dashed to atoms. Deep! deep he sank into the whirling eddies—but he rose instantly to the surface, and struck out lightly for his life! for he was both a bold and active swimmer. At the same instant he shouted loudly— wildly—so as no man can shout who is not in such desperate extremity—again and again for succor! Just at this moment the moon came out bright from the scattered clouds, and showed him all the perils of his state, but showed him no way to escape them, so steeply did the rocks tower above his head—so wildly did the torrent whirl him upon its mad and foaming waters. Again he shouted—and again—and once he thought his shout was answered; fainter he waxed and fainter; he sank—rose— sank, and rose again; a deadlier and more desperate struggle—a wilder yell for help, and the water rushed into his mouth, and a flash reeled across his eyes, and he was floating helplessly—hopelessly down the gulf, when a strong arm seized him, and dragged him to the bank; for he had drifted through the gorge, and the stream flowed here through low and level meadows. A little space he lay there senseless, and then, by the kind and attentive energies of his rescuer, he was brought back to life—and his first glance, as his soul returned to him, feil on the frank face of the man who had preserved him! That man was Frank Hunter! All Edward Hale's best feelings rushed back in a flood upon him—he started to his knee! “I thank thee!” he cried fervently— “with all my soul I thank thee, mighty, Almighty Lord! that thou hast saved me— not from this death alone, but from this deadly sin!” And, seeing Hunter's hand, he poured into his half incredulous and all bewildered ear the story—the confession—of his dark meditated crime. “But there is time—there is yet time,” he cried, “the horses! where are the horses?” “Here! here, Sir Edward,” cried the stout yeoman; “I caught your hunter as I came along, and tied him with my hackney to a tree here at the hill foot.” A moment, and they were both in the saddle, furiously spurring towards a crossroad, which led directly to the place where we have seen the carriage, and leaving the press-gang far behind them; for Hunter had quitted his homeward track on hearing Sir Edward's cry for help, and so avoided that danger. A second bridge, a little lower down the river, soon gave them the means of crossing it and regaining the high road; and they were nearing the lane by which the carriage must come up, at every stride of their horses; and there was now no longer any doubt but they were in good time. Just as they were about to turn, however, down the oft-mentioned lane, they were arrested by the clang of several horses at a gallop, coming down the great road from London, so as to meet them, and by a shout— “Stand! stand! and tell us the road to Arrington!” Edward Hale answered in a moment, for he knew the voice. “Good God! Lord Arthur, is that you?” “Hale! Heaven be praised,” cried the new comer; “then I am in luck. But what the deuce are you doing here? and who is this with you?” Where are St. Maur and Spencer?” “I will tell you another time—I will tell you another time, Arthur Asterly,” replied Sir Edward; for it was Lady Fanny's brother—an officer in the Life Guards—who, at his sister's entreaty, had ridden down post-haste. “Come with me, quick! come with me and see me repair a great intended wrong!” “One minute—for I must tell you now what I have ridden post from town to tell you. I was just off guard at Windsor when Fan sent for me, and I have not had time to take off my uniform! You are the dupe of a set of scoundrels! Spencer and St. Maur have been urging you to a great offence, for their own evil ends! and, grieved I am to say it, with my mother's cognisance. They thought themselves very cunning with their anonymous letters and base schemes to make Fan think you a villain; but Fan and I detected them in no time; and, I thank God! it has been the meaus of bringing my poor father to his senses; and he would have thrown up the cursed marquisate, which was the price of all this kuavery—but the king, for all the evil they speak of him, has acted nobly— nobly! I saw him myself, and told him the whole story, and he wrote a manly and generous letter, in his own hand, restoring the pledge he had given to that seoundrel, Davenant! and I have come down here, post-haste, to save you—and I am time eneugh to do so—am I not, dear Ned?” “Sir Edward was saved ere you came, my lord—if I may be so bold as to speak to you, who are a great gentleman. His own good heart and good feelings saved him,” cried the bold yeoman, half crying with the violence of his emotions. “I am afraid not,” said Sir Edward, unwilling to take any crecit he did not deserve; “it was chance only, or rather Providence—a blessed accident—and gratitude to this good man for his timely service! But for him, Arthur, I should be dead now—dead in the perpetration of a cowardly base crime!” “Well, God be praised that you are saved by any means,” cried Lord Arthur, “but let us gallop on, if there is anything to do!” “Much, much! there is much to do,” answered Hale; “follow, follow!”—and, putting spurs to his horse, he dashed down the lane towards the brick farm-house. They reached it in time; reached it just as Rose Castleton, fainting between surprise and terror—for the girl's head and not her heart had been led astray, and her repentance had been real—was thrust into the carriage by the hand of Henry St. Maur. “St. Maur!” cried Edward, springing from his horse, as he arrived on the spot, “St. Maur, you are a villain! You drove me into this for your own evil ends; but all your villanies are discovered—and you may thank God, if you believe that there is a God, that no more harm has come of it.” And, lifting Rose respectfully out of the carriage, he placed her in the arms of her chosen bridegroom, saying, “Here, take her, Hunter—take her! I give her to you, and will give you her dowry to-morrow—take her, God bless you, and be happy!” “Sir. Edward Hale, you shall answer to me for this, by heaven!” cried St. Maur fariously. “When you will, my lord, when you will!” “Then now, now!” exclaimed St. Maur, “I say now!”—and he unsheathed his rapier ere the words were out of his mouth. Sir Edward Hale followed his example on the instant; and before any one could interpose, their blades were crossed. It was almost too dark for sword play, but the lamps of the carriage were lighted, and the inmates of the farm had by this time run out, with several torches and lanterus, so that the gleam of the weapons could be distinguished in this glimmering light. The young baronet fought only on the defensive, St. Maur thrusting at him with insane and revengeful rashness, so that Edward might have killed him two or three times, had he been so minded. But, at the fourth or fifth pass, the young lord's foot slipped on the wet greeusward, and he fell his full length, breaking his small sword as he did so. “Take your life. Take your life, my lord, and mend it,” said Edward, putting up his sword. Sullenly the young nobleman arose, and shook the hilt of his broken blade at the victor. “You will repent of this!” he said; and, snatching the rein of one of the servants' horses, which stood near, he sprang to its back, and galloping off towards the hall was quickly lost in the swart darkness. But Edward Hale never did repent it. A pause ensned of some moments after his departure, which was at length broken by Lord Arthur Asterly, who said, “Well, we had better all go quietly home to our beds now; and to-morrow we can talk over these things at our leisure; that is to say, if it be not the better plan to bury them all in oblivion; for, by the blessing of Providence, there has no harm befallen any one, and I think the adventures of this night are over. So send away the carriage, Ned, and your people; and let us two trot to the hall together, for I have a good many private explanations for your ear; and we will not hurry, for it is just as well to let those scoundrels have time to evacuate the premises. I do not think they will have the impudence to wait for our coming.” But the adventures of the evening were not over. For, unhappily, Spencer, having grown weary of waiting with his men, left them in charge of the lientenant, and came galloping up to the entrance of the hall in one direction, just as St. Maur arrived there from another, bareheaded, his dress covered with clay, and his seabbard empty by his side. “Ho! St. Maur,” said the captain, as he saw him, “what does all this mean? Whence do you come in this array? Where is Sir Edward?” “It means, sir,” replied St. Maur furiously, for he was in the mood to wreak his spite on any one who happened to be near him, “that Arthur Asterly has come down post from London, and all is discovered, and we are a brace of fools and villains!” “Speak for yourself, pray, my good lord! With regard to yourself I have no doubt you are perfectly right—you must know best,” said Spencer, in the most eoolly irritating manner. “But I allow no man to apply such words to me.” “You will have to fight half the world, then, captain,” answered St. Maur, seeing the folly of quarrelling with his own confederate, “for everything is blown—blown to the four winds!” “Then Hale has given up the wench?” “Given her up! to be sure he has! given her to the farmer fellow; and called me a villain to my teeth! We fought, and but that I fell and broke my sword, I would have—” “Done wonders, doubtless!” interrupted Spencer. “But see here, if I understand you aright, I win a cool thousand of you! You bet me that Hale would have this cursed wench, within a fortnight, for his mastress. Now, as I mean to make myself scarce, and to keep myself on board my frigate until this blows over, you may as well book up.” “Why, Spencer,” exclaimed St. Maur, “you forget—” “Indeed, I forget nothing! did you not make the bet?” Just at this moment Harbottle, who knew not a word of what had been passing, disturbed by their loud voices, came out upon the terrace, with several servants bearing lights, and every word that followed was heard by all of them. “I did; but did we not understand that it was to be drawn in case?—” “Not I, my lord—not I, my lord; I never play child's play. When I bet, I bet; and wlien I win, I expect to be paid. Now the question is, will you pay me?” “No, sir, I will not, for you have not won it. You are cheating me.” “My lord!” “Yes, sir, you are cheating me,” ex claimed St. Maur fiercely. “You are cheating me, or trying to do so! You are—” “Quite enough said, my lord,” answered Spencer, perfectly composed. “You heard him, Harbottle; you heard what he said. Now, my Lord Henry St. Maur, in my mind the quicker these things are settled the better. My pistols are in my holsters loaded; yours are doubtless the same—if not, take your choice of mine!” It was in vain that Harbottle, that the servants, would have interposed—both were determined, obstinate, ynyielding! Ten paces were stepped off upon the terrace—the reluctant servants were compelled to advance the torches—each took a weapon in his hand, and to prevent worse horror—for they swore that if balked they would fight muzzle to the breast, and give the word themselves—Harbottle gave the signal. The pistols flashed at once—but one report was heard—and ere that reached the ears of the spectators, St. Maur sprang up a yard into the air, and fell to the ground dead, with the bullet in his brain! At this moment the approaching sounds of Sir Edward and his friend were heard, quickened by the pistol shots. Spencer's keen ear first canght them; and, as he sprang to his horse, he took a sealed package, undirected, out of the bosom of his coat, and threw it to Harbottle, exclaiming, “Give that to Edward Hale—it is his—and say I am sorry for what has passed; for to him, at least, I owe no ill will.” It was the order to arrest Frank Hunter, under Sir Edward's hand and seal; but before Harbottle had raised it from the ground, the homicide was out of sight, and the young baronet came upon the ground with Lord Arthur Asterly. The fall of the guilty and unhappy St. Maur was the catastrophe of this romance—for a romance it was of domestic life!—and like all other romances, it ended in a marriage! From that day forth Sir Edward Hale was a better and a wiser man!—from that day forth sin had no more any permanent dominion over him! No obstacle now opposed his union, in due season, with charming Fanny Asterly—and with his sweet wife and a fair and noble family— for God smiled upon his marriage—he lived long and happily among his happy tenants; and when he died the country people mourned him, as “the good Lord of the Manor!” THE END.</field>
