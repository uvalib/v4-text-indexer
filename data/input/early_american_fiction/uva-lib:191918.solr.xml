      <field name="fulltext">TO THE YOUNG LADIES, OF Uníted Columbía, These VOLUMES, Intended to represent the specious Causes, AND TO Expose the fatal Consequences, OF SEDUCTION; To inspire the Female Mind With a Principle of Self Complacency, AND TO Promote the Economy of Human Life, Are Inscribed, With Esteem and Sincerity, By their Friend and Humble Servant, The Author. Boston, Jan. 1789.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 2 PREFACE. Novels have ever met with a ready reception into the Libraries of the Ladies, but this species of writing hath not been received with universal approbation: Futility is not the only charge brought against it. Any attempt, therefore, to make these studies more advantageous, has at least a claim upon the patience and candour of the publick. IN Novels which expose no particular Vice, and which recommend no particular Virtue, the fair Reader, though she may find amusement, must finish them without being impressed with any particular idea: So that if they are harmless, they are not beneficial. OF the Letters before us, it is necessary to remark, that this errour on each side has been avoided—the dangerous Consequences of Seduction are exposed, and the Advantages of Female Education set forth and recommended.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER I. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. You may now felicitate me— I have had an interview with the charmer I informed you of. Alas! where were the thoughtfulness and circumspection of my friend Worthy? I did not possess them, and am graceless enough to acknowledge it. He would have considered the consequences, before he had resolved upon the project. But you call me, with some degree of truth, a strange medley of contradiction— the moralist and the amoroso—the sentiment and the sensibility—are interwoven in my constitution, so that nature and grace are at continual fisticuffs.—To the point:— I PURSUED my determination of discovering the dwelling of my charmer, and have at length obtained access. You may behold my Rosebud, but should you presume to place it in your bosom, expect the force of my wrath to be the infallible consequence. I DECLARED the sincerity of my passion—the warmth of my affection—to the beautiful Harriot—Believe me, Jack, she did not seem inattentive. Her mein is elegant—her disposition inclining to the melancholy, and yet her temper is affable, and her manners easy. And as I poured my tender vows into the heart of my beloved, a crimson drop stole across her cheek, and thus I construe it in my own favour, as the sweet messenger of hope:— “DO not wholly despair, my new friend; excuse the declaration of a poor artless female—you see I am not perfectly contented in my situation—[Observe, Jack, I have not the vanity to think this distress altogether upon my account]—Time therefore may disclose wonders, and perhaps more to your advantage than you imagine—do not despair then.” SUCH vulgar, uncongenial souls, as that which animates thy clay cold carcase, would have thought this crimson drop nothing more than an ordinary blush! Be far removed from my heart, such sordid, ?uch"&gt;such sordid, earthborn ideas: But come thou spirit of celestial language, that canst communicate by one affectionate look—one tender glance— more divine information to the soul of sensibility, than can be contained in myriads of volumes! HAIL gentle God of Love! While thou rivetest the chains of thy slaves, how dost thou make them leap for joy, as with delicious triumph. Happy enthusiasm! that while it carries us away into captivity, can make the heart to dance as in the bosom of content. Hail gentle God of Love! Encircled as thou art with darts, torments, and ensigns of cruelty, still do we hail thee. How dost thou smooth over the roughness and asperities of present pain, with what thou seest in reversion! Thou banishest the Stygian glooms of disquiet and suspense, by the hope of approaching Elysium—Blessed infatuation! I DESIRE you will not hesitate to pronounce an amen to my Hymn to Love, as an unequivocal evidence of your wish for my success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER II. WORTHY to HARRINGTON. NEWYORK. “Wish you success!”—In what? Who is this lady of whom you have been talking at such an inconsistent rate? But before you have leisure to reply to these inquiries, you may have forgotten there is such a person, as she whom you call Harriot—I have seen many juvenile heroes, during my pilgrimage of two and twenty years, easily inflamed with new objects— agitated and hurried away by the impetuosity of new desires—and at the same time they were by no means famous for solidity of judgment, or remarkable for the permanency of their resolutions. There is such B a tumult—such an ebullition of the brain in these paroxisms of passion, that this new object is very superficially examined. These, added to partiality and prepossession, never fail to blind the eyes of the lover. Instead of weighing matters maturely, and stating the evidence fairly on both sides, in order to form a right judgment, every circumstance not perfectly coincident with your particular bias, comes not under consideration, because it does not flatter your vanity. “Ponder and pause” just here, and tell me feriously whether you are in love, and whether you have sufficiently examined your heart to give a just answer. Do you mean to insinuate that your declaration of love hath attracted the affection of the pensive Harriot? If this should be the case, I wish you would tell me what you design to do with her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER III. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. I CANNOT but laugh at your dull fermons, and yet I find something in them not altogether displeasing; for this reason I permit you to prate on. “Weigh matters maturely!” Ha! ha! why art thou not arrayed in canonicals! “What do I design to do with her?” Upon my word, my sententious friend, you ask mighty odd questions. I see you aim a stroke at the foundation upon which the pillar of my new system is reared—and will you strive to batter down that pillar? If you entertain any idea of executing such a task, I forefee it will never succeed, and advise you timely to desist. What! dost thou think to topple down my scheme of pleasure? Thou mightest as well topple down the pike of Teneriffe. I SUPPOSE you will be ready to ask, why, if I love Harriot, I do not marry her— Your monitorial correspondence has so accustomed me to reproof, that I easily anticipate this piece of impertinence—But who shall I marry? That is the question. Harriot has no father—no mother—neither is there aunt, cousin, or kindred of any degree who claim any kind of relationship to her. She is companion to Mrs. Francis, and, as I understand, totally dependent on that lady. Now, Mr. Worthy, I must take the liberty to acquaint you, that I am not so much of a republican as formally to wed any person of this class. How laughable would my conduct appear, were I to trace over the same ground marked out by thy immaculate footsteps—To be heard openly acknowledging for my bosom companion, any daughter of the democratick empire of virtue! To suppose a smart, beautiful girl, would continue as a companion to the best lady in Christendom, when she could raise herself to a more eligible situation, is to suppose a folecism—She might as well be immured in a nunnery. Now, Jack, I will shew you B 2 my benevolent scheme; it is to take this beautiful sprig, and transplant it to a more favourable foil, where it shall flourish and blossom under my own auspices. In a word, I mean to remove this fine girl into an elegant apartment, of which she herself is to be the fole mistress. Is not this a proof of my humanity and of heart? But I know the purport of your answer—So pray thee keep thy comments to thyself, and be sparing of your compliments on this part of my conduct—for I do not love flattery. A month has elapsed since my arrival in town. What will the revolution of another moon bring forth? Your &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IV. Miss HARRIOT FAWCET to Miss MYRA HARRINGTON. BOSTON. I have somehow bewitched a new lover, my dear Myra—a smart, clever fellow too—and the youth expresses such fondness and passion that I begin to feel afraid even to pity him—for love will certainly follow. I own to you I esteem him very much, but must I go any farther? He is extremely generous—polite—gay—and I believe if you were to see him, your partiality in his favour would exceed mine. I NEVER saw my poor swain so seemingly disconcerted and abashed as he was a few days ago—he appeared to have something very particular to communicate, but his tongue faultered—ought not one to help out a modest youth in such cases? Your &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER V. Miss MYRA HARRINGTON to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. Are the rural pleasures of Belleview, my dear friend, so engaging as to debar us of the pleasure of your company forever? Do your dear groves, and your books, still employ your meditating mind? Serious sentimentalist as you are, let me ask, whether a Ball, a Concert or Serenade, would not afford you the satisfaction of a contemplative walk in your garden, listening to the love tales of the melodious inhabitants of the air? RAILLERY apart—when shall I take upon myself the honour to wait upon you here?—I want to advise with you on certain points of female conduct, and about my new dress—I have heard you say, lessons to a volatile mind should be fresh and fresh applied, because it either pretends to despise them, or has a tendency to degeneracy— Now you must know I am actually degenerating for want of some of your Mentor like lessons of instruction. I have scarcely any opinion of my own, these fashions, changing about so often, are enough to vitiate the best taste in the world. I FORGOT to tell you my brother has been at home this month; but, from certain indubitable symptoms, I suspect the young man to be in love. HEIGHHO! what is become of Worthy? The time of my liberty steals away, for you know I was to have three or four months of liberty before I gave myself up to his authority, and relinquished all my right and title to the name of Harrington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VI. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. ROSTON. Abashed—confounded—defeated—I waited upon my beloved with my head well furnished with ready made arguments, to prevail on her to acquiesce in my benevolent scheme—she never appeared so amiable—grace accompanied every word she uttered, and every action she performed. “Think, my love,” said I, in a tone something between sighing and tears, and took her hand in a very cordial manner— “Think, my love, on your present, unhappy, menial situation, in the family of Mrs. Francis.” I enlarged on the violence of my passion—expatiated most metaphysically on our future happiness; and concluded by largely answering objections. “Shall we not,” continued I, “obey the dictates of nature, rather than confine ourselves to the forced, unnatural rules of—and—and shall the halcyon days of youth slip through our fingers unenjoyed?” Do you think, Worthy, I said this to Harriot?—Not a syllable of it. It was impossible—my heart had the courage to dictate, but my rebellious tongue refused to utter a word—it faultered—stammered—hesitated.— THERE is a language of the eyes—and we converfed in that language; and though I said not a word with my tongue, she seemed perfectly to understand my meaning—for she looked—(and I comprehended it as well as if she had said)—“Is the crime of dependence to be expiated by the sacrifice of virtue? And because I am a poor, unfortunate girl, must the little I have be taken from me?” “No, my love,” answered I, passionately, “it shall not.” OF all those undescribable things which influence the mind, and which are most apt to persuade—none is so powerful an orator —so feelingly eloquent as beauty—I bow to the allconquering force of Harriot's eloquence—and what is the confequence?—I am now determined to continue my addresses on a principle the most just, and the most honourable. HOW amiable is that beauty which has its foundation in goodness! Reason cannot contemplate its power with indifference— Wisdom cannot refrain from enthusiasm— and the sneering exertions of Wit cannot render it ridiculous. There is a dignity in confcious virtue that all my impudence cannot bring me to despise—and if it be beauty C that subdues my heart, it is this that completes the triumph—It is here my pompous parade, and all my flimsy subterfuges, appear to me in their proper light. In fine, I have weighed matters maturely, and the alternative is—Harriot must be mine, or I miserable without her.—I have so well weighed the matter that even this idea is a flash of joy to my heart—But, my friend, after the lightning comes the thunder—my father is mortally averse to my making any matrimonial engagement at so early a period—this is a bar in my way, but I must leap over it. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VII. Mrs. HOLMES to Miss HARRINGTON. RELLEVIEW. Although my attachment to Belleview is not so romantick as your airy pen has described it, I think its quiet and amusements infinitely preferable to the busfle and parade with which you are surrounded. THE improvements made here by my late husband (who inherited the virtues of his parents, who still protect me, and endeavour to console the anguish of his loss by the most tender affection) have rendered the charms of Belleview superiour in my estimation to every gilded scene of the gay world. IT is almost vanity to pretend to give you a description of the beauty of the prospect— the grandeur of the river that rolls through the meadow in front of the house, or any eulogium on rural elegance, because these scenes are common to most places in the country. Nature is every where liberal in dispensing her beauties and her variety— and I pity those who look round and declare they see neither. A GREAT proportion of our happiness depends on our own choice—it offers itself to our taste, but it is the heart that gives it a relish—what at one time, for instance, we think to be humour, is at another disgustful or insipid—so, unless we carry our appetite with us to the treat, we shall vainly wish to make ourselves happy. “Was I in a defart,” says Sterne, “I would find wherewith “in it to call forth my affections—If I could “do no better, I would fasten them on “some sweet myrtle, or seek some melan “choly cypress to connect myself to—I “would court their shade and greet them “kindly for their protection—If their leaves “withered, I would teach myself to mourn, “and when they rejoiced, I would rejoice “along with them.” I BELIEVE you could hardly find the way to the summer house, where we have enjoyed many happy hours together, and which you used to call “The Temple of Apollo.” It is now more elegantly furnished than it formerly was, and is enriched C 2 with a considerable addition to the library and musick. IN front of the avenue that leads to this place, is a figure of CONTENT, pointing with one hand to the Temple, and with the other to an INVITATION, executed in such an antique style, that you would think it done either by the ancient inhabitants of the country, or by the hand of a Fairy—she is very particular in the characters she invites, but those whom she invites she heartily welcomes. Rural Inscription. COME YE who loath the horrid crest, Who hate the fiery front of Mars; Who scorn the mean—the sordid breast— Who fly AMBITION's guilty cares: Ye who are blest with peaceful souls, Rest HERE: Enjoy the pleasures round; Here Fairies quaffe their acorn bowls, And lightly print the mazy ground. Thrice welcome to this humble scene— (To YE alone such scenes belong) Peace smiles upon the fragrant green, And HERE the WOODLAND SISTERS throng, And fair CONTENTMENT's pleasing train, Whilst in the Heav'n the stars advance, With many a maid and many a swain, Lead up the jocund, rural dance. Thriee welcome to our calm retreat, Where INNOCENCY oft hath strove, With violet blue, and woodbine sweet, To form the votive wreath to LOVE: O! pardon then, our cautious pride— (Caution, a virtue rare, I ween) For evils with the great abide, Which dwell not in our sylvan scene. THESE are the scenes to which I have chosen to retreat; contented with the suffrage of the virtuous and the good, and inattentive to the contemptuous sneer of the giddy and the futile, for even these have the vanity to look with pity on those who voluntarily remove from whatever agrees with their ideas of pleasure. He who has no conception of the beauties of the mind, will contemn a person aukward or illfavoured; and one whose store of enjoyment is drawn from affluence and abundance, will be astonished at the conduct of him who finds cause to rejoice, though surrounded with inconvenience and penury. Hence we judge of the happiness of others by the standard of our own conduct and prejudices. FROM this misjudging race I retire, without a sigh to mingle in their amusements, nor yet disgusted at whatever is thought of sufficient consequence to engage their pursuits. I fly from the tumult of the town— from scenes of boisterous pleasure and riot, to those of quietness and peace, “where every breeze breathes health, and every sound is the echo of tranquillity.”—On this subject I give my sentiments to you with freedom, from a conviction that I bear the world no spleen; at the same time with a degree of deference to the judgment of others, from a conviction that I may be a little prejudiced. I HOPE to be with you soon—in the mean time continue to write. Eliza Holmes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VIII. WORTHY to HARRINGTON. NEWYORK. I applaud your change of sentiment: Harriot is a good girl, and your conduct is extremely praiseworthy and honourable. It is what her virtues incontestibly merit.—But I advise you certainly to gain your father's approbation before you proceed so far as to be unable to return. A contrary step might terminate in the utter ruin of you both.—Direct to me at Belleview—for I intend to stop there in my return to Boston.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IX. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. I have had a conversation with my father on the subject of early marriages, but to no purpose—I will not be certain whether he understood my drift, but all his arguments are applicable to my situation. One must be an adept to argue with him; and interested as he thinks himself in the result of the debate, he cannot be prevailed upon to relinquish his settled opinion. I am too much chagrined to write you even the heads of our conversation. I now stand upon my old ground. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER X. WORTHY to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. I am very happy at present enjoying the sweets of Belleview with our excellent friend Mrs. Holmes. To dwell in this delightful retreat, and to be blest with the conversation of this amiable woman, cannot be called solitude. The charms of Nature are here beheld in the most luxuriant variety—it is here, diversified with a beautiful prospect, the late Mr. Holmes planned his garden; it is elegant, but simple. My time glides off my hands most happily—I am sometimes indulging my solitary reflections in contemplating the sublimity of the scenes around me—and sometimes in conversation with Eliza and the old people. THE old gentleman is a man of a most benevolent heart; he continues to preach— is assiduous in the duties of his profession, and is the love and admiration of his flock. He prescribes for the health of the body, as well as that of the soul, and settles all the little disputes of his parish. They are contented with his judgment, and he is at once their parson, their lawyer, and their physician.—I often read in the little building that was finished by his son. He was a man of an excellent taste, and I have paid my tribute to his memory—It is the same place that you used to admire, and perhaps I improve more of my time in it on that very account. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D LETTER XI. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. I sit down to give you, my dear Myra, some account of the visitants of today, and their conversation. We are not always distinguished by such company, but perhaps it is sometimes necessary; and as it is a relaxation from thought, it serves to give us more pleasure in returning to the conversation of people of ideas. MRS. Bourn assumes a higher rank in life than she pretended to seven years ago.—She then walked on foot—she now, by good fortune, rides in a chariot. Placed, however, in a situation with which her education does not altogether comport, she has nothing disagreeable but her over assiduity to please— this is sometimes disgusting, for one cannot feast heartily upon honey: It is an errour which a candid mind easily forgives. She sometimes appears solicitous to display her mental accomplishments, and desirous to improve those of her daughter; but it is merely apparent. Notwithstanding a temporary wish may arise towards the attainment of this point, a habitual vacancy nips it in the bud. MISS Bourn is about the age of fourteen— genteel, with a tolerable share of beauty, but not striking—her dress was elegant, but might have been adjusted to more advantage—not altogether aukward in her manners, nor yet can she be called graceful— she has a peculiar air of drollery which takes her by fits, and for this reason, perhaps, does not avail herself of every opportunity of displaying the modesty of her sex—she has seen much company, but instead of polishing her manners, it has only increased her assurance. THUS much of the characters of our company. After some small chat which passed as we took a turn in the garden, we entered the Temple. “WHAT books would you recommend to put into the hands of my daughter?” said Mrs. Bourn, as she walked into the library—“it is a matter of some importance.” “It is a matter of more importance,” answered Worthy, “than is generally imagined, for unless a proper selection is made, one would do better never to read at all:—Now, Madam, as much depends on the choice of books, care should be taken not to put those in the way of young persons, which might leave on their minds any disagreeable prejudices, or which has a tendency to corrupt their morals.”—“As obvious as your remark is,” added Mr. Holmes, “it is evidently overlooked in the common course of education. We wisely exclude those persons from our conversation, whose characters are bad, whose manners are depraved, or whose morals are impure; but if they are excluded from an apprehension of contaminating our minds, how much more dangerous is the company of those books, where D 2 the strokes aimed at virtue are redoubled, and the poison of vice, by repeatedly reading the same thing, indelibly distains the young mind?” “WE all agree,” rejoined Worthy, “that it is as great a matter of virtue and prudence to be circumspect in the selection of our books, as in the choice of our company.— But, Sir, the best things may be subverted to an ill use. Hence we may possibly trace the cause of the ill tendency of many of the Novels extant.” “MOST of the Novels,” interrupted my father, “with which our female libraries are overrun, are built on a foundation not always placed on strict morality, and in the pursuit of objects not always probable of praiseworthy.—Novels, not regulated on the chaste principles of true friendship, rational love, and connubial duty, appear to me totally unfit to form the minds of women, of friends, or of wives.” “BUT, as most young people read,” says Mrs. Bourn—“what rule can be bit upon to make study always terminate to advan-tage?” “IMPOSSIBLE,” cried Miss, “for I read as much as any body, and though it may afford amusement, while I am employed, I do not remember a single word; when I lay down the book.” “THIS confirms what I say of Novels,” cried Mr. Holmes, addressing Worthy in a jocular manner, “just calculated to kill time —to attract the attention of the reader for an hour, but leave not one idea on the mind.” “I AM far from condemning every production in the gross,” replied Worthy; “general satire against any particular class, or order of men, may be viewed in the same light as a satire against the species—it is the same with books—If there are corrupt or mortified members, it is hardly fair to destroy the whole body. Now I grant some Novels have a bad tendency, yet there are many which contain excellent sentiments— let these receive their deserved reward—let those be discountenanced; and if it is impossible “to smite them with an apoplexy, there is a moral certainty of their dying of a consumption.”—But, as Mrs. Bourn observes, most young persons read, I will therefore recommend to those who wish to mingle instruction with entertainment, method and regularity in reading. To dip into any book burthens the mind with unnecessary lumber, and may rather be called a disadvantage, than a benefit—The record of memory is so serawled and blotted with imperfect ideas, that not one legible character can be traced.” “WERE I to throw my thoughts on this subject,” said my good father-in-law, as he began to enter more warmly into the debate —drawing his chair opposite Worthy, and raising his hand with a poetical enthusiasm —“Were I to throw my thoughts on this subject into an Allegory, I would describe the human mind as an extensive plain, and knowledge as the river that should water it. If the course of the river be properly directed, the plain will be fertilized and cultivated to advantage; but if books, which are the sources that feed this river, rush into it from every quarter, it will overflow its banks, and the plain will become inundated: When, therefore, knowledge flows on in its proper channel, this extensive and valuable field, the mind, instead of being covered with stagnant waters, is cultivated to the utmost advantage, and blooms luxuriantly into a general efflorescence—for a river properly restricted by high banks, is necessarily progressive.” THE old gentleman brought down his hand with great selemnity, and we complimented him on his poetical exertion. “I cannot comprehend the meaning of this matter,” said the penetrative Miss Bourn. “I will explain it to you, my little dear,” said he, with great good nature—“If you read with any design to improve your mind in virtue and every amiable accomplishment, you should be careful to read methodically, which will enable you to form an estimate of the various topicks discussed in company; and to bear a part in all those conversations which belong to your sex—you see, therefore, how necessary general knowledge is— what would you think of a woman advanced in life, who has no other store of knowledge, than what she has obtained from experi-ence?” “I THINK she would have a sorry time of it;” answered Miss. “TO prevent it in yourself,” said Mrs. Bourn to her daughter, “be assiduous to lay in a good stock of this knowledge, while your mind is yet free from prejudice and care.” “HOW shall I go to work, Madam,” enquired the delicate daughter. MRS. Bourn turned towards Mr. Holmes, which was hint enough for the good old man to proceed. “THERE is a medium to be observed, continued he, in a lady's reading; she is not to receive every thing she finds, even in the best books, as invariable lessons of conduct; in books written in an easy, flowing style, which excel in description and the luxuriance of fancy, the imagination is apt to get heated—she ought, therefore, to discern with an eye of judgment, between the superficial and the penetrating—the elegant and the tawdry—what may be merely amusing, and what may be useful. General reading will not teach her a true knowledge of the world. “IN books she finds recorded the faithfulness of friendship—the constancy of true love, and even that honesty is the best policy. E If virtue is represented carrying its reward with it, she too easily persuades herself that mankind have adopted this plan: Thus she finds, when, perhaps, it is too late, that she has entertained wrong notions of human nature; that her friends are deceitful—her lovers false—and that men consult interest oftener than honesty. “A YOUNG lady who has imbibed her ideas of the world from desultory reading, and placed confidence in the virtue of others, will bring back disappointment, when she expected gratitude. Unsuspicious of deceit, she is easily deceived—from the purity of her own thoughts, she trusts the faith of mankind, until experience convinces her of her errour—she falls a sacrifice to her credulity, and her only consolation is the simplicity and goodness of her heart. “THE story of Miss Whitman[1] [1] THIS young lady was of a reputable family in Connecticut. In her youth she was admired for beauty and good sense. She was a great reader of novels and romances, and having imbibed her ideas of the characters of men, from those fellacious sources, became vain and coquetish, and rejected several offers of marriage, in expectation of receiving one more agreeable to her fanciful idea. Disappointed in her Fairy hope, and finding her train of admirers less solicitous for the honour of her hand, in proportion as the roses of youth decayed, she was the more easily persuaded to relinquish that stability which is the honour and happiness of the sex. The consequences of her amour becoming visible, she acquainted her lover of her situation, and a husband was proposed for her, who was to receive a considerable sum for preserving the reputation of the lady; but, having received security for the payment, he immediately withdrew. She then left her friends, and travelled in the stage as far as Watertown, where she hired a young man to conduct her in a chaise to Salem. Here she wandered alone and friendless, and at length repaired to the Bell-Tavern, in Danvers, where she was delivered of a lifeless child, and in about a fortnight after (in July, 1788) died of a puerperal fever, aged about 35 years. Before her death she amused herself with reading, writing and needlework, and though in a state of anxiety, preserved a cheerfulness, not so much the effect of insensibility, as of patience and fortitude. She was sensible of her approaching fate, as appears from the following letter, which was written in characters. “MUST I die alone? Shall I never see you more? I know that you will come, but you will come too late: This is, I fear, my last ability. Tears fall so, I know not how to write. Why did you leave me in so much dissstress? But I will not reproach you: All that was dear I left for you; but do not regret it.—May God forgive in both what was amiss: When I go from hence, I will leave you some way to find me; if I die, will you come and drop a tear over my grave?” In the following Poem, she, like the dying Swan, fings her own Elegy, and it is here added, as a sorrowful instance, how often the best, and most pleasing talents, not accompanied by virtue and prudence, operate the destruction of their possessor. The description of her unfortunate passion, will remind the critical reader of the famous ode of Sappbo. In genius and in misfortune, these poetical ladies were similar. “DISAPPOINMENT. “WITH fond impatience all the tedious day I sigh'd, and wish'd the lingering hours away; For when bright Hesper led the starrytrain, My shepherd swore to meet me on the plain; With eager haste to that dear spot I flew, And linger'd long, and then with tears withdrew: Alone, abandon'd to love's tenderest woes, Down my pale cheeks the tide of sorrow flows; Dead to all joys that fortune can bestow, In vain for me her useless bounties flow; Take back each envied gift, ye pow'rs divine, And only let me call Fidelio mine. “Ah, wretch! what anguish yet thy soul must prove, Ere thou canst hope to lose thy care in love; And when Fidelio meets thy tearful eye, Pale fear and cold despair his presence fly; With pensive steps, I sought thy walks again, And kiss'd thy token on the verdant plain; With fondest hope, thro' many a blissful bow'r, We gave the soul to fancy's pleafing pow'r; Lost in the magick of that sweet employ, To build gay scenes, and fashion future joy, We saw mild peace o'er fair Canäan rife, And show'r her blessings from benignant skies; On airy hills our happy mansion rose, Built but for joy, no room for future woes; Sweet as the sleep of innocence, the day, (By transports measur'd) lightly danc'd away; To love, to bliss, the union'd soul was given, And each! too happy, ask'd no brighter heaven. “And must the hours in ceaseless anguish roll? Will no soft sunshine cheer my clouded soul Can this dear earth no transient joy supply? Is it my doom to hope, despair and die? Oh! come, once more, with soft endearments come, Burst the cold prison of the sullen tomb; Through favour'd walks, thy chosen maid attend, Where well known shades their pleasing branches bend, Shed the soft poison from thy speaking eye, And look those raptures lifeless words deny; Still be, though late, reheard what ne'er could tire, But, told each eve, fresh pleasures would inspire; Still hope those scenes which love and fancy drew; But, drawn a thousand times, were ever new. “Can fancy paint, can words express; Can aught on earth my woes redress E'en thy soft smiles can ceaseless prove Thy truth, thy tenderness and love. Once thou couldst every bliss inspire, Transporting JOY, and gay DESIRE: Now cold DESPAIR her banner rears, And PLEASURE flies when she appears; Fond HOPE within my bosom dies, And AGONY her place supplies: O, thou! for whose dear sake I bear, A doom so dreadful, so severe May happy fates thy footsteps guide, And o'er thy peaceful home preside Nor let Eliza's early tomb Infect thee, with its baleful gloom.” is an emphatical illustration of the truth of these observations. An inflated fancy, not restricted by judgment, leads too often to disappointment and repentance. Such will be the fate of those who become (to use her own words) “Lost in the magick of that sweet employ, “To build gay scenes and fashion future joy.” “WITH a good heart she possessed a poetical imagination, and an unbounded thirst for novelty; but these airy talents, not counterpoised with judgment, or perhaps serious reflection, instead of adding to her happiness, were the cause of her ruin.” E 2 “I CONCLUDE from your reasoning,” said I, “and it is, besides, my own opinion, that many fine girls have been ruined by reading Novels.” “AND I believe,” added Mrs. Bourn “we may trace from hence the causes of spleen in many persons advanced in life.” “YOU mean old maids, Madam,” cries the sagacious Miss, “like my aunt Deborah —she calls all the men deceitful, and most women, with her, are no better than they should be.” “WELL said exclaimed Worthy, “the recollection of chagrin and former disappointment, sours one's temper and mortifies the heart—disappointment will be more or less severe in proportion as we elevate our expectations; for the most sanguine tempers are the soonest discouraged; as the highest building is in the most danger of falling.” “IT appears from what I have said resumed Mr. Holmes, “that those books which teach us a knowledge of the world are useful to form the minds of females, and ought therefore to be studied.” I MENTIONED Rochefoucault's maxims.— “DO they not degrade human nature?” enquired my father. “THIS little book,” answered Worthy, “contains much truth—and those short sketches traced by the hand of judgment, present to us the leading features of mankind.” “But,” replied my father, “that interest should assume all shapes, is a doctrine, which, in my mind, represents a caricature rather than a living picture.” “It is the duty of a painter to produce a likeness,” said Worthy.—“And a skilful one,” cried my father, continuing the metaphor, “will bring the amiable qualities of the heart to light; and throw those which disgrace humanity into the shade.” “I doubt,” rejoined Worthy, “whether this flattery will answer the purpose you aim to accomplish— You entertain a high opinion of the dignity of human nature, and are displeased at the author who advances any thing derogatory to that dignity. Swift, in speaking of these maxims, in one of his best poems, affirms, “They argue no corrupted mind “In him—the fault is in mankind.” “AS I began this subject,” added I, “it shall be ended by one observation—As these maxims give us an idea of the manners and characters of men, among whom a young person is soon to appear; and as it is necessary to her security and happiness that she be made acquainted with them—they may be read to advantage.” “THERE is another medium,” said Mr. Holmes, assenting to my observation, “to be noticed in the study of a lady—she takes up a book, either for instruction or entertainment; the medium lies in knowing when to put it down. Constant application becomes labour—it sours the temper—gives an air of thoughtfulness, and frequently of absence. By immoderate reading we hoard up opinions and become insensibly attached to them; this miserly conduct sinks us to affectation, and disgustful pedantry; conversation only can remedy this dangerous evil, strengthen the judgment, and make reading really useful. They mutually depend upon, and assist each other. “A KNOWLEDGE of HISTORY which exhibits to us in one view the rise, progress and decay of nations—which points out the advancement of the mind in society, and the improvements in the arts which adorn human nature, comes with propriety under the notice of a lady. To observe the origin of civilization—the gradual progress of society, and the resinements of manners, policy, morality and religion—to observe the progression of mankind from simplicity to luxury, from luxury to effeminacy, and the gradual steps of the decline of empire, and the dissolution of states and kingdoms, must blend that happy union of instruction and entertainment, which never fails to win our attention to the pursuit of all subjects. “POETRY claims her due from the ladies. POETRY enlarges and strengthens the mind, refines the taste and improves the judgment. It has been afferted that women have no business with satire—now satire is but a branch of poetry. I acknowledge, however, much false wit is sent into the world, under this general title; but no critick with whom I am acquainted ever called satire false wit— for as long as vice and folly continue to predominate in the human heart, the satirist will be considered as a useful member of society. I believe Addison calls him an auxiliary to the pulpit. Suffer me to enlarge on this new idea. Satire is the correction of the vices and follies of the human heart; a woman may, therefore, read it to advantage. What I mean by enforcing this point, is, to impress the minds of females with a principle of self correction; for among all kinds of knowledge which arise from reading, the duty of self knowledge is a very eminent one; and is at the same time, the most useful and important. OUR ordinary intercourse with the world, will present to us in a very clear point of view, the fallacious ideas we sometimes entertain of our own self knowledge.—We are blinded by pride and self love, and will not observe our own imperfections, which we F blame with the greatest acrimony in other people, and seem to deteft with the greatest abhorrence; so that it often happens, while we are branding our neighbour for some foible, or vanity, we ourselves are equally guilty. “RIDICULOUS as this conduct must appear in the eyes of all judicious people, it is too frequently practised to escape observa-tion. “I WILL drop this piece of morality, with a charge to the fair reader, that whenever she discovers a fatire, ridiculing or recriminating the follies or crimes of mankind, that she look into her own heart, and compare the strictures on the conduct of others with her own feelings.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XII. Mrs. HOLMES to MYRA. In Continuation. My good father-in-law being so strenuous in proving the eligibility of reading satire, had spun out, what he called his new idea, to such a metaphyfical nicety, that he unhappily diminished the number of his hearers; for Mrs. Bourn, to whom he directed his discourse, had taken down a book and was reading to herself, and Miss was diverting herself with the cuts in Gay's Fables. A CONSIDERABLE silence ensued, which Worthy first broke, by asking Mrs. Bouru what book she had in her hand. Every one's attention was alarmed at this important enquiry. Mrs. Bourn, with little difficulty, found the title page, and began to read, “A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy, by Mr. Yorick.” “I DO not like the title,” said Miss Bourn. “WHY, my dear!” apostrophized the mother, “you are mistaken—it is a very famous book.” “WHY, my dear!” retorted the daughter, “It is sentimental—I abominate every thing that is sentimental—it is so unfashionable too.” “I NEVER knew before,” said Mr. Holmes, “that wit was subject to the caprice of fashion.” “WHY 'Squire Biily,” returned Miss, “who is just arrived from the centre of politeness and fashion, says the bettermost genil never read any sentimental books—so you see sentiment is out of date.” THE company rofe to go out.— “SENTIMENT out of date!” cries Worthy, repeating the words of Miss Bourn, and taking the book from her mother, as she walked towards the door—“Sentiment out of date—alas! poor Yorick—may thy pages never be foiled by the fingers of prejudice.” He continued his address to the book, as they went out, in the same Shandean tone—“These antisentimentalists would banish thee from the society of all books! Unto what a pitiful size are the race of readers dwindled! Surely F 2 these antis have no more to do with thee, than the gods of the Canaanites—In character and understanding they are alike—eyes have they, but they see not—ears have they, but they hear not, neither is there any knowledge to be found in them.” “It is hardly worth while to beat it into them,” said my father-in-law, “so let us follow the company.” WE did so—they walked towards the house, and Worthy and myself brought up the rear. I COULD not but remark, as we went on, that Miss Bourn had spoken the sentiments of many of her sex;—“and whence,” said I to Worthy, “arises this detestation of books in some of us females, and why are they enemies to any thing that may be called sentiment and conversation: I grant it often happens there is such rapidity of speeches that one may be at a loss to distinguish the speakers; but why is there such a calm silence, should an unfortunate sentiment inadvertantly— “I WILL tell you,” interrupted he, “You all read, and it is from the books which engage your attention, that you generally imbibe your ideas of the principal subjects discussed in company—now, the books which employ your hours of study, happen to be Novels; and the subjects contained in these Novels are commonly confined to dress, balls, visiting, and the like edifying topicks; does it not follow, that these must be the subjects of your conversation? I will not dispute whether the Novel makes the woman, or the woman makes the Novel; or whether they are written to engage your attention, or flatter your vanity. I believe the result will shew they depend, in some measure, upon each other; and an uninformed woman, by reading them, only augments the number of her futile ideas. The female mind, notwithstanding, is competent to any task, and the accomplishments of an elegant woman depend on a proper cultivation of her intelligent powers; a barrennefs—a sterility of conversation—immediately discovers where this cultivation is wanting.” “GIVE me leave,” answered I, “to efpouse the cause of this class of females. Tell me candidly, Mr. Worthy, whether that insipid flattery, perhaps sacrificed at the expense of truth, does not misguide many of us into erroneous paths? You declare we are handsome—and your conduct demonstrates you to be more solicitous for the possession of beautiful, than of mental charms. Hence is the deluded female persuaded of the force of her fascinating powers, and vainly imagines one glance of her eye sufficient to reduce a million of hearts whenever she chooses: Her aims, therefore, are confined to the decoration of her person, and her views centre solely in finishing herself in those attractive, allpowerful graces, with which you declare yourselves to be enchanted. How then are they to be censured for neglecting to improve, and to adorn the mind, when your adulation diverts their attention to an external object?” “I JOIN with you,” replied Worthy, “in calling it insipid flattery—and the vain coxcomb, the powdered beau, the insignificant petit maitre, are those who make use of it. Will women of real merit, and sound sense, believe, what is said by them to be their real sentiments?—No—There must be a congeniality in the minds of those who give and receive flattery—Has not the vain coquette as much inclination to be thought a goddess, as the empty admirer to declare her so? “FLATTERY is become a kind of epidemical distemper; many run into it, perhaps, without designing it, or only through civility. There are some women who expect it— who dress to be admired—and who deem it a mark of impoliteness and rudeness in men, who do not pay them the tribute of compliment and adulation. A man of sense may comply with their expectation—he will still think them agreeable playthings, to divert him at an hour of relaxation; but I cannot suppose he will entertain any ferious thoughts of a more permanent connexion. “MAY we not conclude these things to be productive of many evils that happen in society—do they not frighten all sentiment from conversation—introduce affectation— pride—envy—clandestine marriages—elopements —division of families—and ultimately terminate in the ruin of very many innocent, but inconfiderate females?” BY this time we had got into the house, and our company soon after departed, leaving us at full leisure to contemplate on the many wrong ideas entertained, and fallacious steps pursued by the generality of mankind, in the sentimental part of female education. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIII. WORTHY to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. A PEACEFUL, recluse life, is suited to my temper—there is something in the soft breath of Nature—in the delicacy of smiling meadows and cultivated fields—in the sublimity of an aged wood—of broken rocks—of rivers pouring along their lucid waves, to which the heart always gives a ready reception—there is something within us congenial to these scenes; they impress the mind with ideas similar to what we feel in beholding one whom we tenderly esteem. I WAS making this observation to Mrs. Holmes, and she told me I was in love— “These are the very scenes,” said she, “which your beloved Myra used to praise and admire, and for which you, by a secret sympathy, entertain the same predilection. The piece of embroidery which she worked at an early age, and which ornaments the Temple, I have seen you gaze upon several times—you seem to trace perfection in every G part of it, because it was executed by the hand of Myra.” I ACKNOWLEDGE I have often gazed upon it (as Mrs. Holmes terms it) but did not recollect it to be a piece of your work. I stole an opportunity to revisit it by myself, and I instantly remembered it—I remembered when you finished it, and all the happy, inoffensive scenes of our childhood, returned fresh upon my heart. IT is the work of Myra, said I to myself —Did not her fingers trace these beautiful, expanding flowers?—Did not she give to this carnation its animated glow, and to this opening rose its languishing grace? Removed as I am—continued I in a certain interiour language that every son of nature possesses—Removed as I am, from the amiable object of my tenderest affection, I have nothing to do but to admire this offspring of industry and art—It shall yield more fragrance to my soul than all the boquets in the universe. I DID not care to pursue the thought—it touched a delicate string—at first, however, I flattered myself I should gain some confolation—but I lost in every reflection. I CONSIDERED the work as coming from your hand, and was delighted the more with it. A piece of steel that has been rubbed with a loadstone, retains the power of attracting small bodies of iron: So the beauties of this embroidery, springing from your hands, continue to draw my attention, and fill the mind with ideas of the artist. Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIV. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. How incompetent is the force of words to express some peculiar sensations! Expression is seeble when emotions are exquisite. I WISH you could be here to see with what ease and dignity every thing comes from the hand of Harriot—I cannot give a description equivalent to the great idea I wish to convey—You will tell me I am in love—What is love? I have been trying to investigate its nature—to strip it of its mere term, and consider it as it may be supported by principle—I might as well search for the philosopher's stone. EVERY one is ready to praise his mistress —she is always described in her “native simplicity,” as “an angel” with a “placid mein” “mild, animated” “altogether captivating,” and at length the task of description is given up as altogether “undescribable.” Are not all these in themselves bare insignificant words? The world has so long been accustomed to hear the sound of them, that the idea is lost. But to the question— What is love? Unless it is answered now, G 2 perhaps it never will be. Is it not an infinitude of graces that accompany every thing said by Harriot? That adorn all she does? They must not be taken severally—they cannot be contemplated in the abstract.—If you proceed to a chymical analysis, their tenuous essence will evaporate—they are in themselves nothing, but the aggregate is love. WHEN an army composed of a great number of men, moves slowly on at a distance, nobody thinks of considering a single soldier. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XV. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. Am I to believe my eyes—my ears—my heart!—and yet I cannot be deceived.—We are generally most stupid and incredulous in what most materially concerns us. We find the greatest difficulty, in persuading ourselves of the attainment of what we most ardently desire—She loves! —I say to myself, Harriot loves me, and I reverence myself. I THINK I may now take upon me some share of happiness—I may say I have not lived in vain—for all my heart holds dear is mine—joy and love encompass me—peace and tranquillity are before me; the prospect is fair and promising as the gilded dawn of a summer's day—There is none to supplant me in her affection—I dread no rival, for our tempers are similar, and our hearts beat in unison together. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVI. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. Love softens and refines the manners—polishes the asperities of aukwardness, and fits us for the society of gentle beings. It goes further, it mends the heart, and makes us better men—it gives the fainthearted an extraordinary strength of soul, and renders them equal and frequently superiour to danger and distress. MY passions you know are quick, my prejudices sometimes obstinate—She tells me these things are wrong—This gentle reprimand is so tempered with love that I think she commends me. I however promise a reform, and am much pleased with my improvement. Harriot moulds my heart into what form she choofes. A LITTLE party is proposed tomorrow evening, and I shall attend Harriot. These elegant relaxations prevent the degeneracy of human nature, exhilerate the spirits, and wind up this machine of ours for another revolution of business.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XVII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. Our little party was overthrown by a strange piece of folly. A Miss P— was introduced, a young lady of beauty and elegant accomplishments. The whole company were beginning to be cheerful—business and care were disgusted at the sight of so many happy countenances, and had gone out from among us. Jollity and good humour bade us prepare for the dance—unhappily at this juncture a lady and gentleman were engaged in a conversation concerning Miss P—, and one of them repeated the words “a mechanick's daughter”— it is supposed the word “mechanick” was repeated scornfully—She heard it—thought herself insulted—and indignantly retired— Disorder and confusion immediately took place, and the amusement was put an end to for the evening. I WISH people would consider how little time they have to frolick here—that they would improve it to more advantage, and not dispute for any precedence or superiority but in good nature and sociability—“a mechanick—and pray whence this distinction! INEQUALITY among mankind is a soe to our happiness—it even affects our little parties of pleasure—Such is the fate of the human race, one order of men lords it over another; but upon what grounds its right is founded I could never yet be satisfied. FOR this reason, I like a democratical better than any other kind of government: and were I a Lycurgus no distinction of rank should be found in my commonwealth. IN my tour through the United States, I had an opportunity of examining and comparing the different manners and dispositions of the inhabitants of the several republicks. Those of the southern states, accustomed to a habit of domineering over their slaves, are haughtier, more tenacious of honour, and indeed possess more of an aristocratick temper than their sisters of the confederacy. As we travel to the northward, the nature of the constitution seems to operate on the minds of the people—slavery is abolished— all men are declared free and equal, and their tempers are open, generous and communicative. It is the same in all those countries where the people enjoy independence and equal liberty. Why then should those distinctions arise which are inimical to domestick quietude? Or why should the noisy voice of those who seek distinction, so loudly reecho in the ears of peace and jollity, as to deafen the sound of the musick For while we are disputing who shall lead off the dance, behold! the instrument gets out of tune—a string snaps—and where is our chance for dancing?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">H LETTER XVIII. HARRINGTON to WORTHY. BOSTON. My beloved has left me for a while—she has attended Mrs. Francis in a journey to Rhodeisland—and here am I— anxious—solitary—alone!— NO thoughts, but thoughts of Harriot, are permitted to agitate me. She is in my view all the day long, and when I retire to rest my imagination is still possessed with ideas of Harriot.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XIX. HARRINGTON to HARRIOT. BOSTON. If a wish, arising from the most tender affection, could transport me to the object of my love, I persude myself that you would not be troubled with reading this letter. YOU must expect nothing like wit or humour, or even common sense, from me; wit and humour are flown with you, and your return only can restore them. I am sometimes willing to persuade myself that this is the case—I think I hear the well known voice, I look around me with the ecstacy of Orpheus but that look breaks the charm, I find myself alone, and my Eurydice vanished to the shades. I HOPE you will not permit yourself to grow envious of the beauties of Rhodeisland Of the force of their charms I am experimentally acquainted. Whereever fortune has thrown me, it has been my happiness to imagine myself in love with some divine creature or other; and after all it is but truth to declare that the passion was seated more in fancy than the heart; and it is justice to acknowledge to you that I am now more provident of my passion, and never suffer the excursion of fancy, except when I am so liberal as to admit the united beauty of the Rhodeisland ladies in competition with yours. WHERE there are handsome women there will necessarily be fine gentlemen, and should they be smitten with your external graces, I cannot but lament their deplorable situation, when they discover how egregiously they have been cheated. What must be his dis-appointment, who thought himself fascinated by beauty, when he finds he has un-knowingly been charmed by reason and virtue! BUT this you will say contains a sentiment of jealousy, and is but a transcript of my ap-prehensions and gloomy anxieties: When will your presence like the return of the fun in the spring, which dispels glooms, and re-animates the face of nature, quiet these ap-prehensions. If it be not in a short time, I H 2 shall proceed on a journey to find you out; until then I commit you to the care of your guardian angel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XX. HARRINGTON to HARRIOT. BOSTON. Last night I went on a visit to your house: It was an adventure that would have done honour to the Knight of La Mancha. The moon ascended a clear, serene sky, the air was still, the bells sounded the solemn hour of midnight—I sighed—and the reason of it I need not tell you. This was, indeed, a pilgrimage; and no Musselman ever travelled barefooted to Mecca with more sincere devotion. YOUR absence would cause an insufferable ennui in your friends, were it not for the art we have in making it turn to our amusement. Instead of wishing you were of our party, you are the goddess to whose honour we perform innumerable Heathenish rites. Libations of wine are poured out, but not a guest presumes to taste it, until they implore the name of Harriot; we hail the new divinity in songs, and strew around the flowers of poetry. You need not, however, take to yourself any extraordinary addition of vanity on this occasion, as your absence will not cause any repining: “Harriot, our goddess and our grief no more.” BUT to give you my opinion on this important matter, I must descend to plain truth, and acknowledge I had rather adore you a present mortal, than an absent divinity; and therefore wish for your return with more religious ardour than a devout disciple of the false prophet for the company of the Houri. THANKS to the power of imagination for one fanciful interview. Methought I somewhere unexpectedly met you—but I was soon undeceived of my imaginary happiness, and I awoke, repeating these verses:— THOUGH sleep her sable pinions spread, My thoughts still run on you; And visions hovering o'er my head, Present you to my view. By FANCY's magick pencil dreft I saw my Delia move; I clasp'd her to my anxious breast, With TEARS of joy and love. Methought she said—“Why thus forlorn?— Be all thy care refign'd:”— I'woke and found my Delia gone, But still the TEAR behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXI. HARRIOT to MYRA. RHODEISLAND We arrived here in safety, but our journey is not without incident—an incident which exhibits a melancholy picture of the wickedness and depravity of the human heart. WHEN we came to the house of Mrs. Martin, who, I suppose you know is cousin to Mrs. Francis, we were not a little astonished at the evident traces of distress in her countenance; all her actions were accompanied with an air of solemnity, and her former gaiety of heart was exchanged for sad, serious thoughtfulness: She, however, put on a face of vivacity upon our being introduced, but her cheerfulness was foreign to the feelings of her heart. MR. Martin was equally agitated; he endeavoured to dispossess himself of an uncommon weight of remorse, but in vain—all his dissimulation could not conceal his emotion, nor his art abate the continual upbradings of, conscious guilt. MRS. Francis was anxious to enquire the cause of this extraordinary change, but wifely forebore adding to the distress of her friend, by desiring her to explain it, in a manner too precipitate. She was in a short time made acquainted with the particulars of the story—which is not more melanoholy than uncommon. SOMETIME after the marriage of Martin, the beautiful Ophelia, sister to Mrs. Martin, returned from an European visit, to her friends in Rhodeisland. Upon her arrival, she received a polite offer from her ?he"&gt;she received a polite offer from her brother-in-law of an elegant apartment at his house in town, which was cheerfully accepted—Fatal acceptation! He had conceived a passion for Ophelia and was plotting to gratify it. By a series of the most artful attentions, suggested by a diabolical appetite, he insinuated himself into her affection—he prevailed upon the heart of the unsuspicious Ophelia, and triumphed over her innocence and virtue. THIS incestuous connexion has secretly subsisted until the present time—it was interrupted by a symptom which rendered it necessary for Ophelia to retire into the country, where she was delivered of a child, at once the son and nephew of Martin. THIS event was a severe mortification to the proud spirit of Shepherd, the father of Ophelia. His resentment to his daughter was implacable, and his revenge of the injury from Martin not to be satiated The blaze of family dispute raged with unquenchable fury—and poor Ophelia received other punishment from the hand of a vindictive father than bare recrimination. THE affection of Martin now became changed to the vilest hatred. THUS doomed to suffer the blackest ingratitude from her seducer on the one hand, and to experience the feverity of paternal vengeance on the other—and before her the gloomy prospect of a blasted reputation—what must be the situation of the hapless Ophelia! Hope, the last resort of the wretched, was forever shut out. There was no one whom she durst implore by the tender name of father, and he who had seduced her from her duty and her virtue, was the first to brand her with the disgraceful epithets, of undutiful and unchaste. I PERHAPS it was only at this time, that she became fully sensible of her danger; the flattery and dissimulation of Martin might have banished the idea of detection, and glossed over that of criminality; but now she awoke from her dream of insensibility, she was like one who had been deluded by an ignis fatuus to the brink of a precipice, and there abandoned to his reflection to contemplate the horrours of the sea beneath him, into which he was about to plunge. WHETHER from the promises of Martin, or the flattery of her own fancy, is unknown, but it is said she expected to become his wife, and made use of many expedients to obtain a divorcement of Martin from her sister: But this is the breath of rumour. Allowing it to be truth, it appears to be the last attempt of despair; for such unnatural exertions, with the compuction attending them, represent a gloomy picture of the struggle between sisterly affection and declining honour. They however proved unavailable, and her efforts to that end, may with propriety be deemed a wretched subterfuge. IN the mean while the rage of Shepherd was augmenting. Time, instead of allaying, kindled the flame of revenge in the breast of the old man. A sense of the wounded honour of his family, became every day more exquisite; he resolved to call a meeting of the parties, in which the whole mystery should be developed—that Ophelia should confront her feducer, and a thorough enquiry and explication he brought about. OPHELIA exercised all her powers to prevent it; she intreated her father to consent to her desire, but her tears and intreaties were vain. To this earnest desire of his daughter, Shepherd opposed the honour of his family. She replied that such a procedure would publish its disgrace and be subversive of his intention: That she hoped to live retired from the world, and it was in his power to accept her happy repentance: In extenuating, she wished not to vindicate her errours, but declared herself to be penetrated with a melancholy sense of her misconduct, and hoped her penitence might expiate her guilt: She now beheld in the mosglaring colours, the dangers to which she had been exposed, and acknowledged the effects of her temerity had impressed her mind with sincere contrition: All persons, continued she, are not blest with the like happiness of resisting temptation; she intreated her father, therefore, to believe her missortunes proceeded from credulity and not from an abandoned principle—that they arose more from situation than a depraved heart: In asking to be restored to the favour and protection of a parent, she protested she was not influenced by any other motive, than a wish to demonstrate the sincerity of her repentance, and to establish the peace and harmony of the family. I 2 OPHELIA now became melancholy, and her intentions visibly bent on the manner of her death. As the time drew nigh, her sensibility became more exquifite: What was before distress, she now averred to be horrour: Her conduct bordered upon insanity. THE day was appointed to bring to a settlement this unhappy business—the time of hearing arrived—the parties met—the presence of Ophelia was necessary—she was missing—the unfortunate Ophelia died by her own hand. MRS. Shepherd entered the apartment of her daughter—she beheld her pale and trembling —she saw the vial, and the cup with the remains of the poison—she embraced her lost child—“My Ophelia! my daughter! return—return to life.” AT this crisis entered the father—he was mute—he beheld his daughter struggling with the pangs of dissolution—he was dumb with grief and astonishment. THE dying Ophelia was conscious of the distress of her parents, and of her own situation —she clasped her mother's hand, and raising her eye to heaven, was only heard to articulate “let my crime be forgotten with my name.—O fatal! fatal poison!” ADIEU! my dear Myra—this unhappy affair has worked me into a fit of melancholy. I can write no more. I will give you a few particulars in my next. It is impossible to behold the effects of this horrid catastrophe and not be impressed with feelings of sympathetick sorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXII. HARRIOT to MYRA. RHODEISLAND. How frail is the heart! How dim is human foresight! We behold the gilded bait of temptation, and know not until taught by experience, that the admission of one errour is but the introduction of calamity. One mistake imperceptibly leads to another —but the consequences of the whole bursting suddenly on the devoted head of an unfortunate wanderer, becomes intolerable. How acute must be that torture, which seeks an asylum in suicide! O seduction! how many and how miserable are the victims of thy unrelenting vengeance. Some crimes, indeed, ceafe to afflict when they ceafe to exist, but SEDUCTION opens the door to a dismal train of innumerable miseries. YOU can better imagine the situation of the friends of the unfortunate Ophelia than I can describe it. THE writings she left were expressive of contrition for her past transaction, and an awful sense of the deed she was about to execute. Her miserable life was insupportable, there was no oblation but in death—she welcomed death, therefore, as the pleasing harbinger of relief to the unfortunate. She remembered her once loved seducer with pity, and bequeathed him her forgiveness— To say she felt no agitation was not just, but that she experienced a calmness unknown to a criminal was certain. She hoped the rashness of her conduct would not be construed to her disadvantage—for she died in charity with the world. She felt like a poor wanderer about to return to a tender parent, and flattered herself with the hopes of a welcome, though unbidden to return. She owned the way was dark and intricate, but lamented she had no friend to enlighten her understanding, or unravel the mysteries of futurity. She knew there was a God who will reward and punish: She acknowledged she had offended him, and confessed her repentance. She expatiated on the miserable life she had suffered, not that she feared detection, that was impossible; but that she had been doing an injury to a sister who was all kindness to her; she prayed her sister's forgiveness—even as she herself forgave her seducer; and that her crime might not be called ingratitude, because she was always sensible of her obligation to that sister. She requested her parents to pardon her, and acknowledged she felt the pangs of a bleeding heart at the shock which must be given to the most feeling of mothers. She intreated her sisters to think of her with pity, and died with assurance that her friends would so far revere her memory as to take up one thing or another, and say this belonged to poor Ophelia O MY friend! what scenes of anguish are here unfolded to the survivours. The unhappy Shepherd charged Martin with the seduction and murder of his daughter. What the termination of this most horrible affair will be, is not easy to foresee. Adieu!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIII. HARRIOT to MYRA. RHODEISLAND. Whatever may be the other causes (if there were any besides her seduction) which drove the unhappy Ophelia, temerariously to end her existence, it certainly becomes us, my dear friend, to attend to them—and to draw such morals and lessons of instruction from each side of the question, as will be a mirrour by which we may regulate our conduct and amend our lives. A prudent pilot will shun those rocks upon which others have been dashed to pieces, and take example from the conduct of others less fortunate than himself: It is the duty of the moralist, then, to deduce his observations from preceding facts in such a manner as may directly improve the mind and promote the economy of human life. THIS may be an apology for sending you the arguments of Martin in answer to Shepherd, who in his rage and grief had called him the murderer of his child. K HE reminded Shepherd of his obstinacy in persisting in an explanatory meeting, and refusing to grant Ophelia's request in suffering the affair to subside—“Your proud spirit,” said he, “would not hearken to the gentle remonstrance of your daughter—your heart was closed to every conciliatory proposition. Though she expressed a propensity to fly from the eye of the world, she had hitherto appeared lulled in a kind of happy insensibility; yet the approaching time of explanation was terrible, it renewed the story and torture of all her misfortunes, and the idea filled her with grief and dismay. Had you been as willing to receive her, as she to return to you, happy would it have been for both; but your pride was the cause of additional calamities—when the time arrived —But why shall we harrow up our souls with the reiteration of her sorrowful exit?— “FROM these circumstances,” said Martin, “you cannot accuse me as the immediate cause of Ophelia's death; the facts are as I have stated them—and thus was a straying, but penitent child, driven to despair and suicide by a severe use of paternal power, and a vain attempt to resent an injury, for which it was impossible the accused party could make compensation.” NOTWITHSTANDING the plausibility of Martin's plea, I have little hesitation in my mind to charge him with the remote cause of the miserable end of Ophelia. HOW far parental authority may be extended, is a question which I shall not determine; I must however think it depends upon the combination of circumstances. The duty of a child to her parents will be in proportion to the attention paid to her education. If, instead of the usual pains bestowed by many partial parents, upon the vain parade of forming the manners of a child, and burthening the mind wiht the necessity of the douceurs and the graces, would it not often be happier for both, to take a finall share of thought to kindle one spark of grace in the heart? HAPPY the parents, who have bestowed upon their children such an education, as will enable them, by a principle of mediocrity, to govern them without extorting obedience, and to reclaim them without exercising severity. Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXIV. HARRIOT to MYRA. RHODEISLAND. Mrs. Francis is not altogether satisfied with her journey to this part of the country—She does not delight to brood over sorrow—She flies from the house of mourning, to scenes of dissipation, congenial to her temper and disposition—and, like the rest of the world, bears the misfortunes of her friends with a most christian fortitude: K 2 The melancholy aspect of affairs here, will therefore shorten our visit—so you may expect us at Boston in a few days. MY faithful lover (with whom I will certaily make you acquainted in a short time) continues to write to me in very passionate and fentimental strains.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXV. MYRA to HARRIOT. (Written before she had received the preceding.) BOSTON. Your sorrowful little history has infected me with grief. Surely there is no human vice of so black a die—so fatal in its confequences—or which causes a more general calamity, than that of seducing a female from the path of honour. This idea has been improved by my brother, on the hint of your favour—as an acknowledgment for which I inclose you his production. [The Inclosed.] The Court of Vice. An APOLOGUE. VICE “on a solemn night of state, In all her pomp of terrour sate,” Her voice in deep, tremendous tone, Thus issu'd from her ebon throne: `This night at our infernal court, `Let all our ministers refort; `Who most annoys the human race, `At our right hand shall take his place, `Rais'd on a throne—advanc'd in fame— `Ye CRIMES now vindicate your claim.' Eager for praise, the hideous host, All spake, aspiring to the post. PRIDE said, to gain his private ends, He sacrific'd his dearest friends; Infulted all with manners rude, And introduc'd ingratitude. 'Twas he infus'd domestick hate, And party spirit in the slate; Hop'd they'd observe his mystick plan, Destroy'd all confidence in man; And justify'd his high pretentions, By caufing envy and diffentions. INTEMP'RANCE loud, demands the place, He'd long deceiv'd the human race; None could such right as he maintain, Disease and death were in his train. THEFT next appears to claim the station, E'er constant in his dark vocation; He thought the place might well repay, The crime who labeur'd night and day. FRAUD own'd (tho' loth to speak his praise) He gain'd his point by secret ways; His voice in cities had been heard, And oft in senates been preferr'd! Yet much derision had he borne, Treated by honest fools with scorn; His influence on the western shore Was not so great as heretofore: He own'd each side alike assail'd Complain'd how sadly he was rail'd, Curst by the name in ev'ry street, Of Paper, Tendry, Rogue and Cheat: Yet if some honour should requite His labour—things might still go right. MURDER before the footstool stood, With tatter'd robe distain'd in blood. `And who,' he cry'd, with daring face, `Denies my title to the place? `My watchful eyes mankind furvey, `And single out the midnight prey; `Not cowardlike I meet the foe, With footsteps infecure and slow, `Or cause his death by languid strife— `Boldly this dagger ends his life. `Give back, ye CRIMES, your claims resign `For I demand the post as mine. AV'RICE declar'd his love of gold; His nation, or himself he fold; He taught the sin of PRIDE betimes; Was foster-father of all crimes: He pawn'd his life; he stak'd his soul, And found employment for the whole: Acknowledg'd that he gain'd his wealth, By FRAUD, by MURDER and by STEALTH: On one so useful in her cause, VICE well might lavish due applause. The hagger'd host bow low the head, The Monster rofe, and thus she said: `Ye ministers of VICE, draw near, `For fame no longer persevere; `No more your various parts disclose, `Men see, and hate you all as foes. `One yet remains among your crew, `Then rise, SEDUCTION! claim your due. `Your baleful presence quickly parts `The tie that holds the happiest hearts; `You rob—what wealth can ne'er repay; `Like Judas with a kiss betray: `Hence come the starving, trembling train, `Who prostitute themselves for gain, `Whose lanquid visages impart `A smile, while anguish knaws the heart; `Whose steps decoy unwary youth, `From honour, honesty, and truth, `Which follow'd 'till too late to mend, `In ruin, and the gallows end— `Be thine the post. Besides, who knows `Where all thy consequences close? `With thee, SEDUCTION! are ally'd `HORROUR, DESPAIR and SUICIDE. `YOU wound—but the devoted heart `Feels not alone—the poignant smart: `YOU wound—th' electrick pain extends `To fathers, mothers, sisters, friends. `MURDER may yet delight in blood, `And deluge round the crimson flood; `But fure his merits rank above, `Who murders in the mask of love.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVI. MYRA to Mrs. HOLMES. BOSTON. In one of my former letters I acquainted you that I suspected my brother to be in love, and now, Madam, I am enabled to tell you with whom—the amiable Harriot. HARRIOT attended Mrs. Francis in her journey to Rhodeisland, and our young hero has, in her absence, been dreaming of his mistress; and, in a letter to her has written a description of his visionary interview. Harriot, with whom I maintain a constant correspondence, and who keeps no secret from me, inclosed the verses in her laft, L when lo! the hand writing of Master Har-rington. I WAS a little mortified that the young man had kept me in ignorance of his amour all this time, and this morning determined upon a little innocent revenge—“Tommy,” said I, as he entered the room, “here is a piece of poetry, written by an acquaintance of mine—I want your judgment on it”— “Poetry or rhyme,” answered he, advancing towards me, and casting his eye on it—He took the letter and began to read—“Why do you blush, young man?” said I, “Har-riot is a fine girl.”— THIS produced an eclaircissement, and as the matter must remain secret, for a certain weighty reason, I am to be the confidante. I MUST acknowledge to you, Mrs. Holmes, there is a certain je ne sçais quoi in my amiable friend, that has always interested me in her favour—I have an affection for her which comes from the heart—an affection which I do not pretend to account for—Her depend-ance on Mrs. Francis hurts me—I do not think this lady is the gentle, complaifant being, that she appears to be in company— To behold so fine a girl in so disagreeable a situation, might at first attract my commifer-ation and esteem, and a more intimate know-ledge of her virtues might have ripened them into love. Certain it is, however, that whom I admire as a friend, I could love as a SISTER. In the feelings of the heart there can be no dissimulation. PLEASE to tell Mr. Worthy, he may con-tinue to write, and that I will condescend to read his letters. Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVII. WORTHY to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. I AM just returned from a melan-choly excursion with Eliza. I will give you the history of it—We generally walk out together, but we this time went further than usual—The morning was calm and serene— all Nature was flourishing, and its universal harmony conspired to deceive us in the length of the way. WHILE we were pursuing our walk, our ears were struck with a plaintive, musical voice, singing a melancholy tune.—“This,” said Mrs. Holmes, “must be Fidelia—the poor distracted girl was carried off by a ruf-fian a few days before her intended marriage, and her lover, in despair, threw himself into the river”—Eliza could say no more—for Fidelia refumed her melancholy strain in the following words:— TALL rofe the lily's slender frame, It shed a glad perfume; But ah! the cruel spoiler came, And nipt its opening bloom. Curse on the cruel spoiler's hand That stole thy bloom and fled— Curse on his hand—for thy true love Is number'd with the dead. L 2 Poor maiden! like the lily frail, 'Twas all in vain you strove; You heard the stranger's tender tale— But where was thy true love? Thou wast unkind and false to him, But he did constant prove; He plunged headlong in the stream— Farewel, farewel, my love! 'Twas where the river rolls along, The youth all trembling stood, Opprest with grief—he cast himself Amidst the cruel flood. White o'er his head the billows foam, And circling eddies move; Ah! there he finds a watery tomb— Farewel, farewel, my love! WE advanced towards the place from whence the sound issued, and Fidelia, who heard our approach, immediately rose from the ground; “I was tired,” said she, “and sat down here to rest myself.” SHE was dressed in a long white robe, tied about the waist with a pink ribband; her fine brown hair flowed loosely round her shoulders—In her hand she held a number of wild flowers and weeds, which she had been gathering. “These,” she cried, “are to make a nosegay for my love.” “He hath no occasion for it,” said Eliza. “Yes! where he lives,” cried Fidelia, “there are plenty—and flowers that never fade too—I will throw them into the river, and they will swim to him—they will go straight to him”— “And what will he do with them?” I asked. “O!” said the poor girl as she looked wistfully on them, and forted them in her hand, “he loves every thing that comes from me— he told me so”—“He will be happy to receive them,” cried Eliza—“Where he is,” said Fidelia, “is happiness—and happy are the flowers that bloom there—and happy shall I be, when I go to him—alas! I am very ill now”—“He will love you again,” said Eliza, “when you find him out”—“O he was very kind,” cried she, tenderly, “he delighted to walk with me over all these fields—but now, I am obliged to walk alone.” Fidelia drew her hand across her cheek, and we wept with her.— “I must go,” she said, “I must go,” and turned abruptly from us, and left us with great precipitation. Farewel!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER XXVIII. WORTHY to MYRA. BELLEVIEW. My melancholy meditations led me yesterday to the same place where I had seen the distracted Fidelia, and walking down the hill I again beheld her by the side of a beautiful spring—Before I could come up to the place, she was gone—she went hastily over the field—I followed her—after a few minutes walk, I overtook her, and we both went on together towards a small, neat, farm house. An old man was sitting at the door —he gave a sigh as she passed by him to go in—I asked him if she was his daughter— “Alas!” said he, “my poor child—she has been in this state of affliction for near a twelve month.” I inquired what cause produced the loss of her senses—He looked down sorrowfully—the question awakened the gloomy sensations of past evils, the recollection of which was painful, and opened wounds afresh that were not yet healed. “She has lost her lover,” cried the old man—“the youth was the son of one of our neighbours—their infancy was marked by a peculiar attachment to each other. When the young people danced together, Fidelia was always the partner of Henry—as they grew up their mutual tendernefs ripened into passionate affection. They were engaged to each other, and Henry saved all his little stock of money to begin the world by himself. All the town beheld them with pleasure—they wished them success and happiness—and from their knowledge of both their charac-ters, were led to hope they would one day become good members of society—but these hopes are blasted, and they now bestow the bitterest curses on the wretch who hath crushed their expectations—who hath de-prived Fidelia of her senses, and caused the death of her lover. “THE gay Williams comes among us, and participates in our domestick pastimes—he singles out Fidelia, and is affiduous in his at-tentions to her—her little heart is lifted up —but her prudence rises superiour to her vanity. Henry observes the operations of Williams and thinks he sees in him a power-ful rival—the unhappy youth becomes me-lancholy—he sickens with jealousy—the pleasures of our country are forgotten by him—his thoughts are continually employed on his Fidelia.—To complete the measure of his promised happiness he wishes to call her his own—he declares the desire of his soul—Fidelia pledges her faith. He now fees the accomplishment of all his wishes in reversion—his heart leaps for joy—but—as the little paraphernalia is preparing, the ruffian hand of the Seducer dashes the cup of joy from their lips—Fidelia suddenly disappears —Williams—the ungrateful Williams—betrays her to a carriage he had prepared, and she is hurried off. Henry stands astonished —wild with grief and dismay, he appears senseless and confounded. “WHEN the heart is elevated by strong expectation—disappointment and misfortune come with redoubled force—To receive pain, when we look for pleasure, penetrates the very soul with accumulated anguish.” THE old man paused—He endeavoured to hide a tear that was stealing down his cheek—and to check the violence of his passion. I ASKED him how long his daughter was missing—“Not long,” he answered—“the young men, enraged at the insult, arm themselves and pursue the robber—they overtake him—Williams is wounded in the scuffle, and is carried away bleeding, by his servant—My daughter is regained—we M thank Heaven for her restoration. She enquires for her Henry—alas! Henry is no more! The object of his love had flown from him, and with her, all the light of his soul— Darkness and grief had encompassed him— he had no resource, no consolation, no hope —she whom his soul loved was stolen—was wrested from his embrace. Who was there to administer relief?—Who was there to supply her loss?—Not one.—The light of his reason now became clouded—he is seized by despair, and urged forward by the torments of disappointed love, he plunges into the river—to close his sorrows with his life. “THE loss of Fidelia's senses followed this tragical event. “SHE hears the sate of her lover and becomes petrisied—the idea of her sorrows— her own agitation and care for her person, are lost in the reflection of her lover's death. —A while she raved—but is now somewhat restored, and, as you see,the poor maniack strays about the fields harmless and inoffenfive.” THE old man proceeded to inform me of the death of his wife—the idea of one misfortune aroused in him that of another—or rather there was a gradual progression in them, and consequently a connexion—He told me she did not long survive the death of Henry. “O Charlotte!” he cried, “thou wast kind and cheerful—very pleasant hast thou been unto me. I will not cease to regret thy loss, till I meet thee in a better world.” “OUR hearts,” continued the old man, addressing me, “are loosened from their attachment to this world by repeated strokes of misfortune. Wisely is it ordered thus. Every calamity severs a string from the heart—until one scene of sorrow on the back of another, matures us for eternity—Thus are our affections estranged from this scene of misery. The cord that detains the bird is severed in two—and it slies away. “FORMERLY as I sat in this place—in the mild shade of the evening—when I had returned from my labour and took Fidelia on my knee, how often have I rendered thanks to Heaven for the happiness I enjoyed, and implored his power to make my child such another as Charlotte—This sweet remembrance yet swells and agitates my heart, and in the midst of the distress which surrounds me, I feel a consolation in tracing to you a feeble sketch of the happy times that are pasted.” THE old man was sensibly affected—he delighted to dwell on what his child had been—he thought of those times—and he fighed when he contrasted them with the present. “IN her disordered state,” continued he, “she knows me not as a father—I spread my morsel before her, and she slies from it—she forgets the sound of my voice—she is no longer unto me as a daughter. She who hath so often said, she would support me with her arm, and lead me about, when I should be old and decriped—to her I call, but she returns me no answer. Is not the cause of my woe, a melancholy instance of the baleful art of the SEDUCER?—She is deprived of her reason, and knows not the weight of her misery; and I am doubly burdened with her affliction, and the accumulated misfortune of immature decripitude.” “SEDUCTION is a crime,” I observed, “that nothing can be said to palliate or excuse.” “AND wo to him,” added the old man, “who shall endeavour to extenuate it— They have taken away my staff”—continued he, raising a look of imploring mercy to Heaven, while a trembling tear rolled from his swollen eye, “They have taken away my staff in my old age.” FREELY did my heart share in the sorrows of the good old man—when I left him, I prayed Heaven to compassionate his diftress—and as I bent my pensive step towards Belleview, I had leisure to animadvert on the fatal tendency of SEDUCTION. Adies! END of VOL. I.</field>
