      <field name="fulltext">THE OLD CONTINENTAL; OR, THE PRICE OF LIBERTY. BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE DUTCHMAN'S FIRESIDE,” &amp;c., &amp;c. IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. II. CHAPTER I. THE OLD SUGAR-HOUSE—A REVOLUTIONARY WORTHY— LABOUR IN VAIN—THE GOOD EFFECTS OF A LITTLE IMPATIENCE—A SAGACIOUS CONJECTURE, FOLLOWED BY A LUCKY DISCOVERY—A SHOUT—A MIDNIGHT RAMBLE, ENDING IN MEETING WITH A FRIEND—RATS AND RIVINGTON'S GAZETTE—OUR HERO IS CURED OF CERTAIN COMPLAINTS ON THE HOMŒPATHIC PRINCIPLE. The old sugar-house to which our hero and his companion in misfortune were consigned, is still standing[1] [1] It has since been pulled down. to remind us of the sufferings of our fathers, and the price they paid for liberty. To those who have never seen the building, it may not be amiss to state that it is a large, massive, gloomy pile of red-stone, with narrow grated windows, which gives it the air of a prison; standing at the northeast corner of the yard of the Dutch church fronting on Liberty street, which, during the occupation of the city by the British, was used as a riding-school. The aspect of the structure is forbidding, corresponding with the recollections which will long accompany its contemplation, by the descendants and countrymen of many nameless and humble patriots that here became the martyrs to the oppression of a haughty parent, and a petty tyrant whose infamous name is forever associated with the recollection of their fate. It may perhaps furnish an explanation, though not an apology for the harsh treatment inflicted on these unfortunate men, to state the probable causes which led to such frequent violation of the usages of civilized warfare. The people of the united colonies when they took up arms to repel, if not actual despotism, at least principles which, if silently acquiesced in, would have inevitably led to that result, were looked upon by the mother country as rebels resisting the just prerogatives of their sovereign. They were not considered in the light of foreign enemies engaged in authorized and honourable warfare, but as traitors to their king, ungrateful and rebellious children rising against the sacred authority of the parent, and violating all the long recognised obligations of nature and society. Those great principles which are now gradually becoming familiar to the contemplation of the masses of Europe, and which have been not only successfully vindicated, but exemplified by the people of the United States, were at that time considered as heresies of the most aggravated kind, equally at war with all good 1* government, and all true piety. Hence, when the people of a great and growing country rose with one heart and one mind to assert the rights of Englishmen, they were viewed as no better than banditti, equally beyond the protection of the laws, and the settled usages of arms. When the abused and down-trodden captives complained of their ill treatment, they were sneeringly told that they might thank the clemency of their captors that they escaped the gallows. This barbarous policy was after a time arrested by the firmness of Washington, who threatened retaliation; but still, throughout the whole course of the struggle, the treatment of American prisoners was, in most cases, harsh and unfeeling. To these general, were added special causes which operated to increase the hardships of John and his companion. They were strongly suspected of having been engaged in some secret scheme for obtaining and communicating information of a dangerous character, and it was believed that a series of sufferings and inflictions might at length overcome their obstinacy, and produce a disclosure in the hope of being relieved. They were accordingly confined in separate cellars, little better than dungeons, underneath the sugar-house, where they were kept on a scanty allowance of food, in utter loneliness, where nothing but a dim twilight reigned all the day, and nothing could be seen but the grave-stones in the churchyard. The cellars were without flooring, and strewed with rubbish, producing an impression of utter neglect and desolation. Here he was left to enjoy the miserable luxury of his own sad thoughts. Day after day, and night after night, wore tediously away in one dead uniformity— so irksome and intolerable, that when the unfeeling instrument of old Cunningham, the provost-marshal, came to bring his scanty allowance of unwholesome food, and insult him with his ribaldry, it was rather a relief than a hardship. It roused his feelings from the dead level of hopeless despondency, and set his blood once more coursing rapidly through his veins, with a motion something like life and animation. One day, this wretched and vulgar instrument of oppression, taunted him more bitterly than usual, while relating some new disaster that had befallen his suffering country. He told him that Sir Henry Clinton was chasing Mr. Washington, as he called him, the rebel general, through New Jersey; that the people were everywhere coming in to solicit pardon on their knees for having dared to take arms against their lawful sovereign; that all was over with the cause of rebellion; and that their boasted hero and his abettors would soon have a rope about their necks. He accompanied all this with a tissue of gross personal reflections on himself, his condition, and his prospects, that roused him to desperation. He could command himself no longer, but suddenly springing upon the reviler, threw him to the ground, and placing his knee upon his breast, began a course of discipline that caused him to roar most lustily. His cries brought the sentinel stationed without to his relief, who, amazed at the sight of his prostrate comrade, made a push with his bayonet, which might have proved fatal to our hero, had he not dexterously put it aside, so that it merely grazed his ribs, and damaged his linen to a serious extent. Resistance being unavailing, he was secured, ironed, and treated with still more severity. Though blessed with a fine constitution, and great vigour of body, he, in the course of a few days, found himself declining into weakness, languor, and weariness. No prospect of release presented itself, even in dim perspective; for, from what he had learned of his keeper, there appeared little hope that any exchange of prisoners would take place for a long while to come. The recollection of his father's fate, of his home, and of one yet dearer than all these, whom he should probably never see more, all coming in aid of his fears for his country, prostrated his firmness, and reduced him almost to despair. He now scarcely stirred from his bed of straw; and all the livelong, tedious day, was spent in melancholy musing on the past, or bitter anticipations of the future. As thus, he one day sat, unconsciously scraping with his bare foot, in the rubbish of the cellar, he felt it pricked by something pointed and sharp. Without any precise motive he sought what it was, and discovered a rusty nail, which, it instantly occurred to him, might be converted to some useful purpose. Groping about further, he found various pieces of old iron, which appeared to have lain there a long time unnoticed. A sudden hope flashed upon his mind, and hiding the new found treasures under his bed, he proceeded to examine the grated window of his miserable abode. The scrutiny afforded him little comfort. The walls were thick, and firmly cemented. The iron bars were strong, forming squares of not more than four inches diameter, and appearing deeply incorporated with the solid stone. None of the implements he had discovered among the rubbish afforded the material for a saw sufficiently hard to operate on these bars, even if it were in his power to convert them into such an instrument, and once more he sat down to chew the bitter cud of despair. But this was not his element. His natural spirit was elastic and vigorous. There was a spice of foolhardiness in his disposition, which, when it prompts to successful daring, is lauded as the inspiration of courage and genius, but when it leads to disaster and defeat, dwindles into folly or desperation. Perhaps the world is right in judging of men by the event of their undertakings, since, however desperate they may seem, they are justified by success. The chances may, indeed, appear to be a hundred or a thousand to one against them; but what is chance but a Jack of both sides, one moment an enemy, the next a friend smoothing the path, and working miracles greater than those of witchcraft or magic. Be this as it may, our hero was not a man to calculate chances when the case was already desperate. He could not be worse off than he was, in his own opinion; and the result of his deliberations was a determination to go to work at once, let what might be the consequences. He remembered how the soft water wears away the hard rock, and that a little every day makes a mickle at the end of the year. The visits of his keeper were so perfectly uniform, that there was little danger of discovery; and the gloomy solitude of the churchyard secured him from observation in that quarter. Animated by these favourable circumstances, he set himself to work with the nail, the point of which he had sharpened against the wall, and laboured until fatigue compelled him to desist for a time. His design was to pick out the mortar, by which a large stone on each side of the window was cemented to the others, and thus, if possible, detach them, so that they could be removed and the iron bars withdrawn. When tired, he stood for a while contemplating his work, but he could scarcely see what he had done. The mortar was of the olden time, such as we seldom see in these degenerate days. It was as hard as flint. Still something had been done. He had made a beginning, and a beginning, if persevered in, must inevitably come to an end. His progress was, indeed, almost imperceptible, but though slow, it was sure, and to hasten slowly is the shortest way to success in the end. At all events, he had an object in view—an excitement—something to employ his mind and exercise his body. In short, he was inspired by a hope, which, however distant and uncertain, was sufficient to stimulate him to exertion, and arrest the progress of that leaden apathy which is the invariable concomitant of despair. He only remitted his exertions when he expected a visit from his keeper, or when wearied to absolute exhaustion, and passed a good portion of the night in his laborious occupation. As his progress became more apparent, he took the precaution to fill up the crevice with mortar, prepared by mixing some of his allowance of water with the earth of his prison floor, in order to guard against a discovery previous to the visits of his attendant. Thus he went on from day to day, and week to week; but his progress was so slow, that he calculated one night after labouring till he became quite exhausted, that at the rate he was going on, it would take at least two years to complete his work. The conviction, extinguished the hope by which he had hitherto been sustained, and drove him to desperation. A fit of sudden phrensy came over him, and he seized the iron bars of the window as if to vent his rage on the great obstacle to his escape. To his utter astonishment, the bars yielded to his hand, and fell inwards to the ground, coming nigh breaking his head. The cellar had been occupied by a criminal, condemned to death for some offence by a court-martial. While here, he had been furnished by an accomplice or friend, with the means of sawing the bars, and had succeeded so far as to render his escape almost certain the very next night, when his fate overtook him, and he was executed the day before. This happened but very recently preceding the capture of our hero, and the state of the window remained undiscovered, until he fortunately lost all his patience, and thus demonstrated by the event that it is sometimes highly judicious to fall into a passion. Fearing the noise of the falling bars might have been heard by the sentinel without, he hastily replaced them, and throwing himself on his straw, pretended to be fast asleep, though, as might be expected, his mind was busily employed in pondering over his present situation and prospects. One great obstacle to his escape was removed, but there was another equally insuperable in his way. His legs were ironed, and admitting he managed to leave his cell, it was next to impossible to escape speedy detection afterwards. His hopes died away with this conviction, and once more he gave himself up to the most gloomy anticipations. From this state he was roused by the sentinel whose duty it was to go the rounds of the night, and who had heard the falling of the bars, although he knew not whence the noise proceeded. He entered with a light, and commenced a scrutiny which made the heart of the prisoner throb with intense anxiety. He searched the cell in every part, examined the bed, and coming to the window, where he discovered the vestiges of John's labours with the rusty nail, laughed with insulting scorn at his fruitless efforts. Last of all, he held his light up to the window, when, as fortune would have it, a puff of wind extinguished it instantaneously, leaving them in utter darkness. The soldier muttered a malediction, and groping his way out, locked the door after him. “He will return again with a light, and then a discovery is inevitable,” thought John, who waited his coming with moody resignation, or rather indifference. But he returned no more, and the prisoner was left without further interruption to his own reflections. These, at length, led him to the probability, that the person who sawed the bars might have left behind him the implement by which he performed his work. The thought at once roused him to action, and he resolved to institute a search next morning. If found, it would enable him to free himself from his shackles, and thus the great obstacle to his escape be removed. Accordingly, soon as the day dawned in his gloomy abode, he commenced a close scrutiny into every part of his cell; but it was looking for a needle in a haystack, and ever and anon he was on the point of abandoning it as hopeless. The hour for bringing in his breakfast, found him thus occupied, and he was somewhat startled at seeing his keeper, accompanied by a stranger he had never seen before, who bade the other retire, lock the door, and wait outside. “Well, young sir,” said he, abruptly, and in a harsh tone, “are you not almost tired of your pleasant lodgings?” John rallied his manhood, and answered in a careless, bantering mood, “No; I should not much mind spending all my days here. It is a quiet place, only a little too dark.” “The d—l you wouldn't! Come, come, young man, none of your jokes—I came to talk seriously with you.” “Well, sir, talk to me seriously, and I will answer you seriously.” “Well then, seriously, would you not like to be permitted to return to your friends?” “Most certainly, sir. I am not in love with these irons, nor this miserable abode under ground.” “Well, you are at liberty to leave it at any time, on one or two conditions.” “Be good enough to name them,” said John, eagerly. The stranger then advanced close to him, and addressed John almost in a whisper: “You have been employed by Mr. Washington to gain information. VOL. II. 2 You are in his confidence, then, and you have only to do for Sir Henry what you were employed to do for him, to entitle yourself not only to freedom, but to honours and rewards.” “Thank you, sir,” answered John. “Thank you, sir—what do you mean by that?” “I mean, sir, that I will not accept your conditions.” “Your cause is ruined.” “It is not the less a good cause.” “Your boasted Washington is flying before Sir Henry.” “He will turn one of these days on his pursuers.” “The rebels are coming in crowds to accept the king's mercy.” “The tories you should say. I will never believe that one honest, true hearted whig will ever ask or accept pardon for having had the courage to defend his rights.” “Confound your impudence—do you mean to say that subjects have a right to rebel against their lawful sovereign?” “Certainly, if their sovereign acts unlawfully, I do.” “Very well—very good—very orthodox, Mr. Rebel. I'll not dispute the point with you.” “Why not, sir—you have the best of the argument. You have the right of the strongest on your side, you see,” said John, pointing to his irons. “So, sir—you are sneering at me, are you? Do you know who I am sir?” “No sir—nor meaning no offence—do I wish to know.” “My name is Cunningham,” and the speaker paused, drawing himself up to his full height, and waiting the event of this formidable annunciation. But the effect was by no means what he anticipated. John had heard a hundred, nay hundreds of stories of the petty tyranny, the base impositions, the unfeeling insolence of this man towards his helpless countrymen, and the mention of his name instead of cowing his spirit to submission, only roused a spirit of indignation which over-mastered all his prudence. To the question, if he had ever heard that name before, he replied with scorn and bitterness. “Yes, I have heard it before, from many a poor prisoner who coupled it with curses. It is the name of one who uses an office none but cruel, sordid, low minded men ever seek or accept, for the purpose of oppressing his fellow creatures; filching from the wretches whom the fortune of war has rescued from death on the field of battle to endure a thousand deaths afterwards, their scanty allowance of miserable food, thus heaping up riches at the expense of their sufferings; insulting their cause and their country; outraging their feelings while he starves their bodies, and adding to the miseries of confinement every ingenious device of petty malignity. You perceive I know you, sir.” During this imprudent speech, Cunningham was boiling with rage and mortification. Its truth added to its severity, and he became for a few moments speechless with passion. Then lifting his cane, he advanced towards the prisoner, muttering unintelligible oaths, and was about to give him a blow, when John coolly and sternly said: “That's right, sir—prove the truth of all I have said by beating a prisoner in irons. Strike, sir, but take care, for my arm is free, and I will smite you to the earth, if I die for it the next minute.” Whether it was that the provost marshal still retained amidst the rubbish of his worthlessness, some little remains of that soldierly feeling which forbids offering violence to the defenceless, or was overawed by the threat still ringing in his ears, is somewhat doubtful, but certain it is, he lowered his cane and answered John in a tone of suppressed bitterness: “You are right, young man. I will not disgrace myself by striking you. Though an insolent rebel, you are a defenceless man. But mark me, sir, you shall pay for this. I have the means, and the will to try your mettle. You seem a brave lad,” added he in a tone of significant irony, “and I like to experiment on such materials. I'll put you to the proof before many days are over, and perhaps give you reason to curse me.” Saying this he departed, leaving our hero to cogitate on the extreme imprudence of his behaviour on this trying occasion. The significant threat of the petty tyrant, served, however, to rouse him to resume the search which the entrance of Cunningham had interrupted. But now, as before, the search was vain, and he relinquished his labours with his hopes. Remaining thus in the numbness of despondency, it suddenly occurred to him that he had not searched the bed, and his hopes revived a little. He commenced playing his last stake, and on a close examination discovered that one of the corners of the miserable, filthy bed had been ripped open sufficiently to admit his hand. Thrusting it eagerly in, and feeling amongst the straw, he at length drew out something which, on carrying to the window, he found was a little saw made of a watch-spring. His heart leaped in his bosom, and resolving not to lose a moment, lest his purpose should be thwarted by the fulfilment of Cunningham's threat, he eagerly commenced to operate on his irons. While thus employed, he expected every moment to see it put in execution; and at every noise without, a cold chill thrilled to his heart. But not a soul come near him, and strange to say, he rejoiced at going without his dinner, though both hungry and athirst. It once or twice, indeed, occurred to him, that the tyrant of the prison intended to bring him to submission by starvation; but he felt that the moment he relieved himself from his irons, he might defy the old sinner and all his works. Fortunately, as he thought, the night set in with a storm of thunder and lightning. The rain poured down in torrents; bright, and almost incessant flashes, followed by quick crashes, alone, from time to time, changed the deep gloom into a sheet of living fire, leaving the obscurity still deeper, as it passed away. The streets became deserted, both man and beast having sought their homes. With a view, if possible, to escape from York Island before the day dawned, John had decided to leave his prison as soon as the hour for bringing in his evening meal had passed. The hour came, but no supper, and it seemed now evident that the intention of the provost was to put him on short allowance, if not to starve him outright. He 2* now prepared himself for the crisis of his fate. Approaching the window, he cautiously removed the grating, and putting out his head listened and looked with intense anxiety. Nothing was heard but the concert of the elements; nothing seen but the swift flashes of lightning, disclosing objects for an instant, then leaving them in utter darkness. He passed himself through the window, and stood forth in the open air a free man once more. His course led him across the churchyard, where was stationed a sentinal, who like a discreet and prudent man had sought refuge from the pelting storm, by ensconcing himself within the recess of the south door of the church, where he remained perfectly quiet. It should have been noted before, that when John was taken before Sir Henry Clinton, he was accommodated with a suit of coarse white cotton, in order that he might not offend his excellency with his beggar's rags, and that he wore it still. It was a little soiled, to be sure, but was in a fair way of being well washed on this occasion. The darkness was profound, except at momentary intervals, and our hero's first exploit was to tumble into a new made grave, half filled with water, a rather ominous accident. Whether a pause in the storm just at that moment enabled the sentinel to distinguish the splash our hero made in falling, or accident drew his attention in that direction, is not known; but certain it is, he happened to be looking that way, just as a vivid flash of lightning disclosed the whole figure of John emerging from the grave. If there ever walked a ghost, the sentinel had a fair excuse to conclude this was one. He acted from irresistible impulse, fired his gun at random, fell flat on his face on the stone steps, and roared out murder with all his might. Our hero, though he did not mistake the sentinel for a ghost, was somewhat more alarmed than if he had been a true believer, and, in common parlance, “made tracks” across the churchyard without looking behind him, or, if the truth must be told, before, either, for there was little use for his eyes except when the lightning flashed them blind. He trusted altogether to Providence and his legs, and by great good fortune, at length broke his nose against the fence fronting on Nassau-street. Scrambling over it, without stopping to grumble or swear, as some people do on such occasions, he let himself down on the other side, and as he bade adieu to the old sugar-house, could not help laughing to hear the doughty sentinel roaring out “Murder! fire! help! help!” in the midst of the uproar of the elements. The discharge of the gun, and subsequent outcries, roused the guard and brought them to his rescue. He was found lying flat on his face, kicking with all his might, and carried to quarters, where, recovering his recollection by degrees, he astounded his auditors with one of the best authenticated ghost stories on record. Many believed him; some laughed at him; and it was not until next morning, that the worshipful Provost Cunningham, for the purpose of ascertaining the effect of his experiment on John, having paid him a second visit, discovered the whole mystery. Immediate measures were taken to secure him, the result of which will appear in the sequel. In the meantime, John pursued his way through the storm and darkness, with all the speed in his power. But his long absence from the city had rendered his recollection somewhat indistinct, and this, aided by the obscurity of a stormy night, greatly embarrassed his progress. He continued to verify the old proverb, “The more haste, the less speed,” and finally, becoming fairly bewildered, lost his way, and wandered he knew not where. Thus threading the mazes of the dark, muddy streets, without rudder, compass, or landmark, he at length saw a light at a distance, and having no other alternative, made towards it with all speed, in the hope of ascertaining at least where he was by the aid of its glimmering. Cautiously approaching, he discovered that it proceeded from a window, the shutters of which were not closed, into which he took the liberty of peeping, and saw, to his great surprise, as well as gratification, the stranger who had been captured with him at Spuyten Duyvel, and committed to prison at the same time with himself. Hastily drawing back, he paused a few moments for reflection. There was now no hope of clearing the lines on the island before daylight, and consequently a place of concealment during the coming day was absolutely necessary to his safety. He reflected, also, that he had this man in his power, should he betray him, and that a regard to his own safety would prevent him from endangering that of his old companion. His determination was soon made, and he cautiously knocked at the door. After a brief silence, a voice, which he recognised as that of the stranger, inquired, “Who's there?” “A friend,” replied John, in a low tone. The door was then cautiously opened by the stranger, who had many reasons for dreading nightly visiters, and his dismay was evident, as, recognising who it was, he hastily exclaimed— “My God! what brought you here?” “Let me come in, and I'll tell you.” With evident unwillingness, the stranger complied, and closing the shutters, again anxiously asked an explanation, which was given in as few words as possible. After reflecting a while, the stranger observed— “Your situation is exceedingly critical, not to say desperate. It is now impossible for you to leave the city to-night, and old Cunningham will move heaven and earth to find you. You must remain here till tomorrow night.” “But the boat—could I not escape in your boat?” eagerly asked John. “What, in such a night as this? Besides, I have no boat. I sold it to avoid further suspicion, just as I keep my window open to let them see I am quietly at home. No, you must remain here to-morrow, though it will be at the risk of my life, perhaps.” “Then I will not remain,” replied John; “if I am retaken, they can only put me back where I was. Only allow me to rest myself, and give me something to eat, for I am half starved, and I will leave you before daylight and take my chance.” “When I said it would be at the risk of my life.” answered the other, “I did not mean that would deter me from receiving and secreting you. I risk it every day for our cause and our country, and I have seen enough of you to know you for one of their bravest defenders. Stay where you are, while I get you something to eat.” Saying this, he left the room, and soon returned with food and drink, of which, as may be presumed, his guest partook most heartily. After he had satisfied his hunger, he addressed his host— “But how did you manage to get out of prison?” “I have friends in the royalist ranks, who interceded for me, and I have money to make more, if necessary. But I am still suspected, and, I believe, watched. You must, therefore, consent to take the lodging I shall provide for you. It is under ground, to be sure, but you are used to that, you know. You are lucky in finding me alone, to-night. My wife is on a visit to Long Island, for a few days, and our only attendant is with her; so, you see, I keep bachelor's hall for the present. But it is time to prepare for your accommodation, for the night is far spent. Follow me, and lend a helping hand.” John assisted him in removing a bed and other necessaries into a back cellar, all which he was directed to hide in an empty hogshead, and turn it upside down in the morning. He then showed him a concealed trap-door, which opened into a lower cellar, where he might hide himself in case of an alarm. “I must not see you again. I am not to know you are here; and as you will have rather a lonely time of it, here is something to amuse you to-morrow, if you can find light enough to read.” He then handed him a file of Rivington's Royal Gazette, and after cautioning John to be quiet, and not go near the cellar-windows, shook hands and departed, leaving our hero to his repose. But sleep visited not his lids, which, like quarrelsome neighbours, refused to come together, and he lay awake for hours, tortured with solicitude as to his future fate. The idea of being again brought within the toils of old Cunningham, was inexpressibly revolting, and he resolved, if possible, never to be again taken alive. Then came the vision of a fair and gentle maid, whom he fancied he saw mourning his absence, or, perhaps, distorting his sudden and mysterious disappearance into a desertion of the cause of liberty. The picture was cruelly affecting to his love and his pride, and brought bitterness to his heart. At length, however, wearied and worn down by his previous struggles and long confinement, he sunk to rest under the weight of his sorrows. But there was no rest for him here. The moment he closed his eyes, what seemed an army of rats, sallied forth, and assaulted him in divers ways; at one time, scampering athwart his face, and peradventure assaulting his nose; at another, nibbling at his toe; while, at times, they would appear to muster all their forces and gallop over his body, squealing and squeaking defiance, as it were, of the insolent intruder upon their hitherto undisputed domain. Then they made assaults on his stock of provisions, which he was finally obliged to take into bed with him, and defend tooth and nail. In short, they gave him no peace; and such is the virtue of petty vexations, that, from the moment the plague of the rats commenced, he never once thought of old Cunningham, the vision of the fair maid mourning his absence, or the dark future before him. It was not until the opening dawn scared away his persecutors, that he fell into a deep sleep, that lasted till the sun shone into his cellar-window, and long after his usual hour of rising.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. JOHN REALIZES THE PREDICTION OF THE OLD CONTINENTAL, AND PUTS ON A BRITISH UNIFORM—IS CUT SHORT IN A CAPITAL SPEECH, AND IS PUSHED OUT OF DOORS—NIGHT ERRANTRY—HE TRUSTS A WOMAN, AND LO! WHAT FOLLOWED—MOUNTS ANOTHER MAN'S HORSE, BY MISTAKE, IT MAY BE PRESUMED—A RACING AND SWIMMING MATCH— MANY A SLIP BETWEEN CUP AND LIP—HE FALLS OUT OF THE FRYING PAN INTO THE FIRE. The storm had passed away when our hero awoke; the sun glanced his golden beams even into the deep recesses of the cellar, and the busy racket of the town, announced that the greatest of all slaves, the civilized man, had commenced his daily round of money-making and money-spending. Each one, among the many thousand citizens, was chacing the phantom happiness under a different disguise, unconscious that in every shape, and under every mark, it was only a spectre he was pursuing. The shopkeeper was marshalling his wares at the windows in showy array; the cartman was rattling over the pavement; the milkmen cudgelling their ponies, or beating up their tin pails, and calling up the loitering kitchen maids in a language not to be found in any of the books; the market-women and butchers, were cheating the citizens, the citizens cheating each other; and the stiff, upright red-coat soldiers, were strutting about, thinking of love, glory, and plunder, or running in debt without paying. The day was to John one of alternate impatience and depression. He had in some measure reconciled himself to his old quarters in the sugar-house; but the short glimpse of liberty he enjoyed, even in the midnight storm, was inexpressibly welcome, and only made his present confinement more intolerable. As a last resource, he resorted to the file of Rivington's Royal Gazette, where he was greeted with such dismal accounts of the defeats, the sufferings, and cowardice of his countrymen, coupled with remarks so contemptuous and irritating, that he felt his blood boiling and bubbling in his veins. Judging from these relations, he feared it was all over with his country, and that should he escape his miseries now, it would be only to become the slave of a power content with nothing less than absolute supremacy. Coming at length to on exquisite specimen of scurrilous loyalty, he could contain himself no longer, but dashsd the papers to the ground, kicked and stamped on them, and almost annihilated various and special transendentalisms of loyality, as well as veracity, that would have done credit to a British traveller, and not disgraced the old termagant of the London Quarterly Review. After this victory he felt considerably relieved, and passed the rest of the day with a tolerable degree of quiet resignation. When night came, and the shops were shut, when the streets no longer echoed to the footsteps of the busy throng, the stranger paid his guest a visit, bringing with him a bundle, which he announced as containing VOL. II. 3 a suit of women's clothes, which he spread out before our hero, who demanded for what purpose they were intended. “You sir,” replied the other, “It is quit eimpossible you should escape in that white dress, which can be seen half way across the island in these moonlight nights. You must put these on, and pass for a woman.” “Excuse me my good friend, I shall do no such thing. If I am taken it shall be as a man, not as a woman. No, give me a sword, only give me a sword, and let me fight my way if necessary. I am determined never to be taken alive again, if any chance is left me to sell my life. Besides, as a woman, I shall certainly be stopped, for what business can a woman have to be wandering alone at midnight. If I am seen, my walk will be sufficient, and if I speak, my voice will betray me.” “I believe you are right,” answered the other, after pausing a few moments. “And now I recollect, there is in my possession a suit of British uniform, which— which I sometimes find useful,”—he said this with a significant smile—“if you prefer it.” “By all means,” cried John, interrupting him, “let me have that, let me wear anything but petticoats.” Heavens! thought he, what would Jane say if she saw me in petticoats! “It will do,” cried the stranger. “You shall, if seen or intercepted, pass for a messenger carrying a letter from the commander-in-chief to the officer commanding the outposts. Wait a moment, and I will go and write one, and bring the uniform.” He returned in a few minutes with the letter and the uniform, which John eagerly seized, and disrobing himself, put on the red-coat and its appendages, which he found fitted tolerably well. But one thing was wanting, and that was a sword, which he was assured would not be necessary, and perhaps only bring him into trouble. On this point, however, he was peremptory; he would not stir a step without some means of defending himself, and the other at length assented. When the sword was brought, John seized it eagerly, at the same time exclaiming, “now I am a man, and have the means of dying like a man! but hark!” “It is only the patrol going the rounds. It has passed, and now is your time. Come, rise and go forth, and God speed you.” John followed him out of his den, and the stranger cautiously reconnoitring from the front door, ascertained that the coast was clear, and the sky becoming cloudy. “Now is your time,” said he, “no thanks—away, and my best wish is never to see you more, until this city returns to the hands of its lawful owners. Here, take this,”—handing him money—“you may want it by the way. Now go, and again I say, God speed you.” “I'm off,” replied the other; “but before I go, let me assure you of my grateful recollection of your kindness. I know what you risk by it, and so sure as I live, if I escape this night, I will never cease to serve you with my heart, my hand, and my sword. Should you get into any difficulty on my account, let me know it, and I swear by my Maker I will give myself up to old Cunningham in exchange, fight for you, die for you, if it be necessary to your—” “Get away with your long speeches,” interrupted the stranger, half jesting, half earnest; “never fear for me, but look to yourself. You are a brave lad, and I hope we shall meet again. In the meantime, get about your business.” Saying this, he fairly pushed our hero into the street, and shut the door in his face. His object was to make the best of his way to Harlem river, and swim it at some point where it was narrowest. Once on the other side, and his escape would be almost certain, as the enemy had no post beyond York Island in that direction. Fortunately, or unfortunately, as the case might be, the night became dark, and though this circumstance embarrassed his progress, it at the same time diminished the chances of discovery. He found little difficulty in clearing the city, the extent of which was not what it is now, and soon found himself on the road to Kingsbridge. Nothing happened to impede his progress, or excite apprehension, until he came to the lines extending from the East river to the Hudson. Here, he paused, to reflect on the course most proper to pursue; and having decided this point, he crept cautiously along, under cover of darkness, gradually approaching the lines with the intention, if he found a chance which was not desperate, to attempt passing through them. But his scrutiny only ended in perpetual disappointment, for the sentinels were placed at such short intervals from each other that the prospect was hopeless. It more than once occurred to him, to present himself boldly under cover of his disguise, exhibit his letter to a sentinel, and demand permission to pass. But when he reflected on the probability, if not certainty of being taken before the officer of the guard, and his utter inability to undergo the slightest examination, he decided to make this the last resort. He now resumed his peregrination, and traversed from one extremity of the lines to the other without success, when the crowing of a cock warned him of the approach of day. It smote on his ear like a passing bell, and announced the absolute necessity of seeking some place of concealment, as well as rest; for he was not the man he was before his long confinement, which had for the time impaired his vigour, and now found himself almost overcome with fatigue. The crowing of a second cock, which was answered by others, warned him that not a moment was to be lost, and he hastily turned away from the vicinity of the lines to seek some place where he might hide himself. Groping his way among the swamps, and thickets of vines and briars, in the interior of the island, he, just at the dawn of day, suddenly came upon a little hut, which sufficiently indicated the poverty of its occupants, if such it had, and retiring behind a tuft of alders reconnoitred the premises. Nothing about the hut, however, indicated that it was inhabited. Neither domestic animal, nor domestic bird, appeared, nor any garden, or cultivated spot of any kind, gave token of human labour. He was about to advance and try the door, when at that moment it was opened by a female, who stepped forth, and after gathering a few dry sticks, returned into the house. She seemed of a 3* middle age, and was poorly clad; but her garments were neither ragged or dirty, and her face, so far as he could distinguish through the gray dawn, was free from those strong, indelible marks, which so unerringly indicate bad passions and a dissolute life. In a little while, the smoke curled forth from the chimney of sticks and clay, and a savoury incense, proceeding from broiled salt fish, saluted the nostrils of the tired and hungry wayfarer, sorely tempting the inward man to the imprudence of entering and partaking thereof. There seemed no other human being about the place but this lonely female, and he asked of himself, when it was that a woman refused kindness and relief to the hungry or distressed wanderer. Encouraged by the reply of his own heart and his own experience, he came forward with confidence, and presenting himself at the door requested shelter and food. The woman seemed neither alarmed or surprised, while she made him this reply— “I have nothing to give you. You have made me a beggar already.” “I will pay you for your kindness,” said John, showing her a piece of gold. “So you often told me before. The king pays you, but you never pay anybody. Your coat is a license for plundering us poor women. You will find breakfast at your quarters, not here.” “But I am starving.” “So am I. This is my last meal, and you see there is nothing to spare. You red coats have taken care of that.” She spoke with such bitter emphasis when alluding to the red coats, that John began to hope she was a rebel in her heart, and communed with himself whether it would not be his best policy to disclose his real character, and at once appeal to her sympathy as an American soldier. It was a dangerous experiment, but his case was desperate, and, as he decided, justified the experiment. “I suppose,” said he, “you have heard that the rebel general is flying on his last legs through the Jerseys, and that the cowardly Yankees are coming in by thousands, with halters about their necks, to throw themselves on the mercy of King George?” The good woman, who was at that moment turning a piece of salt fish on the gridiron, if three ribs, without any legs, merit that respectable name, gave a sudden irritable start, dropped the fish in the ashes, hastily snatched it up, and turning full upon him, exclaimed, echoing John's words— “Rebel general—halters about their necks, do you say? You'll be hanged before you see that day.” There was no mistaking the action, the look, or the tone, accompanying these words. “It is useless to stay here,” continued she, “you get nothing from me, for I have nothing left for you to buy or steal. If you insult me, you will get as good as you bring; and if you dare to use me ill, though I am but a woman, a wretched, lonely woman, I have the will and the strength of a man to defend myself. Go away, and get your breakfast from King George.” “King George owes me no breakfast. Though I wear his livery, I am not his servant.” “No! Well, now I come to look at you a little, you don't look as if that coat was made for you. If you hadn't shown me your gold, I could have almost sworn you was an American. But the defenders of their country have no money but rags.” Being now fully assured, he at once disclosed his name, the purpose of his disguise, and his present critical situation. The woman listened with a friendly interest, and at once offered him what food and shelter it was in her power to afford. During their homely repast, they talked over the best means of securing his safety during the day, and his escape the ensuing night. She declared that both would be exceedingly difficult. Her hut was frequently visited by straggling soldiers, who, in the wantonness of lawless power, played those pranks which so often degrade the dignity of that profession, which, more than any other, should elevate men above robbing the weak, or insulting the defenceless. “But why do you remain alone in this wretched hut, exposed to these insults and outrages?” asked John. “Because I have an only son, a prisoner in the city, and go every day to carry him such little things as I can procure for his comfort; and when I have nothing to bring, I can still weep for him. I have tried to get him released, but I fear he will at last be carried to the hospital-ship, and die, as all do who go there, for he is every day growing more pale and weakly.” The poor mother wept as she told her story, and John, not knowing how to comfort her, remained silent until she recovered herself. He then told her he was very much tired with his night's ramble, and asked permission to rest on the bed standing in a corner of the room. “Not there—not there!” exclaimed she, eagerly. “You may be discovered. Can you sleep upon straw?” “Aye, on a rock!” The good woman then pointed him the way up a ladder into a little garret, where was a quantity of straw, and strictly enjoining him not to stir whatever might happen, left him, removing the ladder, which she secreted outside the hut, after which she resumed her household occupations. In less than ten minutes our adventurer fell into a profound sleep, and for a while forgot all his troubles. From this blessed oblivion he was roused, after a nap of some hours, by the tramp of horses about the hut, mingled with the voices of his hostess and that of men. Listening with intense and breathless anxiety, he could distinguish the purport of their conversation. The voice of the man was that of one inquiring after himself, and that of the woman was disclaiming all knowledge of such a person as he described, which she could do with a safe conscience, as the fugitive was represented in the dress in which he escaped from prison. The morning had disclosed his departure, and spoiled the ghost story of the trusty sentinel, who never lived to hear the last of that affair. The circumstance of the sawing of the iron grating, produced a conviction of his having had accomplices without, and this, together with the zeal of old Cunningham to recover his prey, caused more than usual solicitude for his apprehension. Not being found in the city, patrols of horse had been sent out in various directions, and the doughty provost-marshal himself promised five guineas for his body, dead or alive. One of his favourite experiments on the powers of human endurance, had been brought to an untimely close by the abrupt, unceremonious evasion of his guest, and he felt all the mortification of a scientific devotee at the failure of a pet theory. The colloquy between the hostess and her visiters, became more and more interesting as it approached the crisis, and the tenant of the garret felt his heart die away, as he heard the leader of the party declare his intention to carry his investigations into that quarter. His detection was in that case inevitable, unless he escaped beforehand. But the invention of our hero was as quick as a hair-trigger, and he determined on his course in an instant. He had noticed that there was an opening in the old weather-beaten roof, close to the chimney, apparently large enough for him to pass through; and that the chimney, being such as was once common in houses of the ordinary kind, was composed of pieces of wood laid crosswise, the interstices being filled up with mortar, and the ends projecting out at the corners sufficiently to form a sort of ladder, affording an easy ascent to the top. The moment the real ladder was found, and applied to the opening in the floor of the garret, he rose swiftly and silently from his bed of straw, tripped on tiptoe to the chimney, which he climbed up without much difficulty, and emerged through the opening in the roof to the top of the hut. Peeping warily round for an instant or two, he saw with great satisfaction that the whole party had left their horses, and were engaged in the search, being confident that no enemy could surprise them within their own lines. Quick as thought, he slid down the roof to the ground, and in a moment was on horseback, skirring like the wind, while the party remained unconscious that he had been there, or that he had escaped. “What can that fellow be riding after at such a rate over the common?” said the officer, who, having finished his search in the garret, was looking out at the door. “What has become of my horse?” cried one of the troopers. “That fellow must have stolen him,” exclaimed another; and in a trice, all but the unfortunate owner of the horse, mounted in pursuit of the thief, or, as they all believed, of some mischievous fellow-soldier who was playing them a trick. And now commenced a chase, such as had not been seen for many a day in the renowned island of Manhattan, which, in compliance with a vulgar custom, we have hitherto called New York. John had made a fortunate selection, and his horse kept the lead handsomely until he reached the British lines, where a sentinel was on duty. Here, holding up the letter with which he had been furnished, and crying out, “For the commanding officer at Kingsbridge,” he darted past without stopping, and without any attempt to stop him, the sentinel having either been taken by surprise, or presuming he was the bearer of important despatches. The arrival of the pursuers a few moments after, explained the mistake, but threw little light on the real state of the case, and at all events, it was now too late to stop the fugitive, who continued on full speed, while the others followed in his rear without gaining upon him until he came to Harlem river, where the stream was narrow. Here, he plunged in, and had got nearly half-way over, when he heard a discharge of pistols, and the bullets whistling about his ears. Taking the hint, he urged forward his steed by every means in his power, and had nearly reached the opposite bank, when a fresh party arrived, and taking for granted that he was a deserter, fired with better aim. One of the balls struck his cap, and without penetrating, occasioned such a sudden dizziness, that as he mounted the bank of the river, he fell from his horse, and, stunned with the blow and the fall, remained insensible. In this helpless state he was easily taken, and when he came to himself was carried back to New York, not as the prisoner who had escaped from the old sugar-house, but a British soldier who had stolen a horse, and attempted to desert to the rebels. What might have been his ultimate destiny under this misconception, no one can tell, had he not been recognised by the soldier who had stood sentinel over him while a prisoner, and subsequently, by the renowned provost-marshal, who never forgot the face of one whom he had marked out as a victim. Being seriously ill from the effects of the blow on his head, his fall, and the disappointment of all his hopes just at the moment they seemed about to be realized, he was consigned to the Hunter hospital-ship, which was moored in the East river, near the Wallabout. What happened to him on this transition from purgatory to the regions of darkness, despair, and death, the reader will know in good time, should he deign to peruse the next chapter of our humble tale.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 4 CHAPTER III. “No masts or sails these crowded ships adorn, Dismal to view, neglected and forlorn, From morn to eve, along the decks we lay, Scorch'd into fevers by the solar ray; No friendly awning cast a welcome shade, Once it was promis'd, but was never made; No favours could these sons of death bestow, 'Twas endless vengeance and eternal wo; On every side dire objects met the sight, And pallid forms, and murders of the night.” Philip Freneau. Those who derive their impressions of the hardships, privations, and sufferings of the people of the United States, during the war of independence, from the general history of the times, will form but a vague idea of their magnitude and extension. History, for the most part, records but great events, and deals only with those illustrious characters and actions, which have an immediate or remote influence on the fate of nations. The conflicts of great armies, the siege of fortified places, and the sacking of cities, are carefully recorded; while the plunder of harvest-fields, the robbery of the husbandman of the fruits of his labours and the necessaries of life, the burning of his home, the slaughter of his wife and children, the perpetual fears and never-ceasing insults and outrages, which generally accompany the march of invading armies— all these, if alluded to at all, are expressed in loose generalities, which make little if any impression on the mind. The sufferings of the individual are lost in the mass of national distress, or only remembered in traditions which grow more obscure and doubtful at every succeeding generation, and come at last to be considered either fabulous or doubtful. The state of New York was among those which suffered most severely in the struggle to maintain the principles of the revolution. Her capital was occupied by the enemy during almost the entire period of the war; her western frontier was exposed to invasion from Canada, to perpetual devastation and massacre by the tories and Indians of the Six Nations, instigated and led on by the Johnsons, the bloody Butlers, and the savage Brant; and there was not a county in the state, on which the foot of the invader was not imprinted in the soil. The massacre of Cherry Valley, of Schoharie, and other places, then almost without a name, and the long succession of bloody atrocities along the whole valley of the Mohawk, although only slightly referred to, or not noticed at all in our general histories, will long be remembered by the posterity of those who were their victims. But there was still another class of obscure and lowly patriots, whose fate, though still more melancholy than that of all the others, has excited less sympathy because it is less known. Hundreds, nay, thousands of as hardy and devoted spirits as ever the love of freedom animated and inspired, suffered long, and died lingering deaths on board the hospital and prison-ships, still remembered by a few of our aged citizens as the abode of misery and despair. They perished, unnoticed and unknown, amid insults, scoffings, and privations of every kind. They died like dogs, and like dogs they were buried. Their names have perished with their bodies, and the monument erected to commemorate their sufferings and devotion, has only sufficed to record that a multitude of victims to the cause of their country here mingle their bones together. Let it not be supposed these remarks are made with a view to revive, or strengthen, or perpetuate national antipathies. They have a higher and a better object; namely, to pay a homely tribute to lowly worth and unrecorded patriotism; to show the price which our fathers paid for liberty, and the obligation which rests on all their posterity dearly to cherish what was so dearly purchased. The Hunter prison-ship, into whose bosom our hero was consigned, was an old dismasted hulk, which some that are yet living have not forgotten, and never will forget. Dismantled, neglected, and decayed, she lay on the water, a black and dismal object without; within, the abode of anguish and despair. The story of the miseries endured by our captured countrymen in that wretched tabernacle of sorrow, will never be thoroughly known; but enough is preserved by tradition, and in the memory of a few gray-headed survivors, to give some idea of the sufferings of those who died. It will generally be found that the direction and superintendence of prisoners of war falls to the lot, if it is not sought by a class of men having no other feeling to gratify but a sordid love of gain, or the indulgence of a petty spirit of tyranny. Sometimes, perhaps, a more humane and generous spirit may accept the painful office with a view to alleviate the miseries of war; but even on such occasions, it would seem that the perpetual contemplation of human suffering, instead of softening, gradually hardens the heart. Custom at length reconciles them to what they see all day long, and produces insensibility, if not an actual taste for the banquet of human sorrows. There are men who are known to be amateurs in the art of inflicting pangs on their fellow-creatures, and others who enjoy with incredible zest, the dying struggles of a condemned malefactor. People of more tender and refined feelings, are apt to shrink from stations in which they might best administer to the miseries of others; and hence, we frequently find that hospitals, jails, and poor-houses, and most especially those belonging to military establishments, are placed under the immediate superintendence of those whose hearts are naturally insensible to the contemplation of human suffering, or whom long habit has hardened into viewing it without pain or sympathy. When it becomes a daily routine of duty to attend the sick or relieve the poor, it is very likely to be performed like any other everyday business. It would be unjust, therefore, to involve a whole nation in one common censure, on account of the harsh treatment inflicted on our countrymen in the prison-ships at New York, were it not that the like was generally experienced elsewhere, during the progress of the struggle, until it was in some measure checked by the threat of retaliation. The facts are 4* sanctioned by history, as well as living evidence; and no one can give an adequate picture of the revolution without dwelling strongly on the theme of domestic calamity and private suffering. The unfortunate subject of our story was consigned to this receptacle of misery, debilitated by fever, and depressed by bitter disappointment, and was placed between decks among a crowd of squalid invalids, whose condition was rendered desperate by the absence of all the comforts necessary to their existence. It was now summer, and the heat was equally intolerable by day and by night; for if they had strength to crawl on deck during the former, there being no awning, they were exposed to the broiling sun; while, during the latter, they were stifling below in crowds, amid a pestilential atmosphere steaming from the lungs of death. The uncaulked deck admitted the rain to pour down upon them; the pumps were continually going; the water they drank, when the extremity of thirst drove them to it, was always stale, filthy, and frequently full of animalculæ; and the allowance of food scanty, as well as of bad quality. Add to this, the attendants, the physician, and the petty officers, were almost without exception insolent and unfeeling.[2] [2] See “The Prison-Ship,” by Philip Freneau, who was confined in one of these vessels. To this “Floating Hell,” as she was universally denominated by the Americans, was John consigned, and laid side by side with many a fellow-sufferer who never rose again. They were crowded so close, that there was scarcely room to turn round in his narrow straw bed; the heat was intense; the air absolutely stunk of mortality, and nothing was heard but the groans of the sick and dying. His feelings, quickened by the feverish irritation of his pulse, and the pain in his head, overpowered his firmness, and as he lay down for the first time in this dreary abode, on the evening of his arrival, he groaned in agony. The signal was answered by a wretch, who lay beside him, in a tone which he thought he had heard before. He raised himself by a desperate effort, and gazed wildly around, through the dim twilight of the floating dungeon. Another groan, followed by inarticulate murmurs, the product of a diseased fancy, succeeded. It seemed the voice of his father. “I, too, am mad,” thought John, as he recalled the time when the captain had expired in his arms. A few moments again elapsed, when the same voice exclaimed, in feeble accents, “Will no one bring me water—water—water? Oh! give me water!” It was, indeed, the voice of his father. The young man sprung on his elbow, placed his face close to that of the poor sufferer, recognised the pallid features, and casting himself down by his side, sobbed aloud with mingled feelings of joy and sorrow. “My father! my dear father!” cried he, at length, and clasped the withered, burning hand, that lay languid and helpless by the side of the old man. “Who calls me father? I have no children—no friends here. I cannot even get a drop of water.” “It is I—your son—come to die with you.” The captain made an effort to rise, but it was all in vain. He lay panting and feeble, a little while, and then desired John to put his face close to his own, that he might see if it was him. He complied, and the poor father recognised his son by the light of a lamp just brought in by one of the attendants. He put his feeble arms about his neck, and welcomed him, not in gladness, but bitter sorrow. “You had better be in your grave, than here,” said the old soldier; and his voice rambled away in disjointed murmurs, indicating a mind shattered by pain and suffering. Then again he cried out, “Water— water! for God's sake, give me some water!” None answered, and no water came. John essayed to rise, but the moment he did so, his head turned, and he sunk down again on his bed. He then repeated the call for water, as loud as his weakness would permit, and at length some was brought. The captain put forth his hands with famished eagerness, and John held it to his lips. It seemed to have been dipped from some standing pool, but such was the thirst of the poor old soldier, that he emptied the vessel at a single draught. Then sinking down, he fell into a doze, interrupted at intervals by low inarticulate moanings. It was now the hour when the convalescent patients who had been permitted to roast themselves on deck during the day, were driven down into the hold to pass the night among the dying and the dead. This accession to their numbers, added to the heat and impurity of the confined air, created an atmosphere divested of every wholesome principle of life. A night ensued, the details of which would have no other purpose than to convert pity into horror. The ravings of delirium, mingled with the curses of despair, and the taunts of unfeeling attendants, who, instead of alleviating the anguish of the wretched prisoners by sympathy, indulged in all the bitterness of political animosity. Ever and anon, some spirit winged its flight from this tabernacle of wo, and six dead bodies signalized the triumph of death, that melancholy night. The son passed a great portion of the time in watching the father, who sometimes lay perfectly quiet for an hour or two, and then again commenced his low, disjointed moans and mutterings. Anxiety for the sufferings of the captain, in a great measure conquered all sense of his own, and he was sensible of nothing but a raging thirst, increasing every moment. A supply of water had been brought him, but so fætid and filthy, that he found it impossible to swallow a single drop. Thus realizing the tortures of Tantalus; seeing nothing by the light of the dismal lamp, but a melancholy array of suffering countrymen lying side by side, and presenting a condensation of misery; hearing nothing but the moanings of despair, the screeches of madness, and the rattle in the throat of death; borne down by weakness, and abandoned by hope, John lingered out the almost endless night, until towards the dawn, when nature gave way, and he sunk into a disturbed sleep. When he awoke, he felt himself somewhat relieved of his pains, and found his father partly raised on his elbow, gazing on him with a look of sorrowing sympathy. “You seem better this morning, sir,” said he. “No, my son, I shall never be better. Who can hope to get well in such a den of misery as this? No, John, I shall soon add one more to the long list of martyrs who have paid their last debt to their country here. Would to God, I could have died somewhere in the sight of the world, that those who come after me, might have known that such a man once lived and laboured in their cause. Here we die like dogs, are buried like dogs, and forgotten as soon as dead. Such is the reward of lowly men, when they pay with their lives the price of liberty.” “Father—dear father! do not despair. I hope and trust you will yet see our people free and happy, and to be known as one who aided with all his heart in securing to them the blessing. Some day or other we shall return home, and enjoy in peace what we have earned in war, under our own vine and our own fig-tree.” “You may, perhaps, my son, but I never shall. Few that enter this dismal hole, ever return alive. The only journey they make is to yonder shore, where they are thrown into a hole with curses on their heads, instead of prayers, and lay and rot together. I shall never see home again; never visit any but my last, long home—whatever happens to my country, I shall soon be free. In the grave I shall find both repose and liberty.” “Who talks of liberty here? Silence, you rebel rascals!” exclaimed a rough voice, in a foreign accent. It was the doctor, as he was called, though he disgraced a profession than which none is more honourably distinguished for humanity and gentleness. He had come to take his morning rounds among the sick, the dying, and the dead; and such another brute, in the shape of man, perhaps never disgraced his Maker, or his species. Ignorant and brutal, his only experience was that acquired by a thousand professional murders. Instead of sympathizing with the wretched victims to the fate of war, he met their complaints with unfeeling taunts, and answered every groan with oaths and blasphemies. He had come from a distant land, and was one of those sold by his sovereign, as a slave to assist in riveting the chains of his fellow creatures in another quarter of the globe. His practice accorded with his mission. Some he despatched with pills; some with blisters; some he bled to death; and some he forced out of the world by rude attempts to make them swallow his nostrums. In his nature he was harsh and cruel, and his prejudices against the cause his patients had espoused, co-operating with his natural disposition, together with a long familiarity with such scenes, had all combined to produce a total insensibility to their sufferings, if not a more inhuman feeling of actual enjoyment. This degenerate professor of the healing art, in the course of his rounds, expressed his satisfaction at finding some half a dozen of his patients had, during the night, rid him of the trouble of attending them. It would be equally painful and disgusting to repeat his unfeeling jests, and vulgar ribaldry, for there are degrees of vice and inhumanity, the details of which nothing but historical truth will justify; and, though our sketches of these scenes are drawn from the relations of those who actually saw and heard what we relate, we are not writing a history, but a tale. At length it came to the turn of John and his father to undergo the torture of an examination. To the latter he merely observed, “Ah! you will soon be out of your misery, you rascally rebel;” to the former, he addressed such consolation as might be expected from such a comforter. He told him he could cure him, but it was hardly worth while, for he would certainly be hanged as soon as he recovered strength enough to mount the gallows, unless he put on the red coat in earnest, as he had done in jest, the other day. “What say you,” added he, “will you enlist in the service of King George, or stay here and die, like that old rebel scoundrel by your side.” The Yankee blood boiled in our hero's veins, as he listened to this cruel speech; but for once in his life, discretion come to his aid. He reflected on his utter helplessness, and the folly of irritating this inhuman dog in office, at whose mercy his father now lay. Accordingly he gulped down a flood of glowing indignation, that added ten-fold to his burning thirst, and remained silent. “What, stubborn, hey?” resumed the caitiff; “very well, we shall soon break down your rebel spirit. I have a way of doing these things, that never fails to bring a recruit to King George, or send one to the d—l. I only wish Davy Sproat, our superintendent, was not such a sheep-hearted fellow. If he would only give me fair play, I'd make quick work with such fellows as you, and turn this into a recruiting, instead of a hospital-ship.” “Yes,” said the captain, in a feeble voice, “it is already a recruiting ship for the armies of death.” “So, so—you can talk, can you? I'll soon stop your rebel mouth. Here—swallow these directly. Your case is already desperate, and requires desperate remedies. Very likely they'll finish you, but the sooner you are out of the way the better.” Here he handed the captain half a dozen pills, and insisted, with bitter oaths, on his swallowing them. “I will take no more of your drugs. Your work is done already. Between you and the fever, I am little better than a dead man. Let me die in peace.” The unfeeling monster swore he should not die in peace, and was about to force the patient to swallow his pills, when John, forgetting all else but filial affection, and suddenly invigorated by the feelings of a son, started on his feet, and seizing the doctor by the collar, sent him reeling to a respectable distance. The wretch was a coward, as well as an oppressor, and only vented his rage in threats and imprecations. He brandished his gold-headed cane in defiance, called John by every opprobrious name his knowledge of English would permit, and finally made his exit swearing he would accommodate him with a strait jacket. The agitation of this scene, increased the fever and weakness of the poor captain, who had now scarcely strength to answer the inquiries of his son concerning the particulars of his escape from that death, which he was assured had taken place before he left him, on the night of the adventure at Kingsbridge. In as few words as possible, and with many intervals of breathless weakness, the captain informed him that he had only fainted from loss of blood, and was shortly afterwards found in that state, by a party of British, which VOL. II. 5 had come out to remove the bodies of their companions who had fallen in the skirmish. By them he was taken to the guard-house, and recovering his senses, was subsequently seized with a slow fever, during the progress of which he was sent to the hospital-ship to be cured. “They have succeeded,” said the captain, dying away with the exhaustion of telling his story. All that day John watched over his parent, who was evidently hovering on the verge of that invisible line which separates the world of flesh from the world of spirits. Sometimes, after long intervals, he would seem to rally, and at such times spoke a few words consecrated to the past and the future. He enjoined upon his son never to tell his parents the particulars of his fate. They had already mourned his death, and it would only be renewing their grief to be told that he had as it were twice died. At another time, he conjured him, while he watched over their declining age, never to forget what he owed to his country and the sacred cause of freedom. Thus passed the day, and when evening came, it brought the doctor's wonted visit, who, though he did not venture within reach, stood shaking his cane, at the same time informing John, “If it had not been for the milk-and-water captain, he would have figured in irons before now.” John heeded him not, for he was watching the last moments of an only parent. The captain was now in a deep, leaden sleep, such as, at a crisis like this, either ends in death, or from which he would probably only wake to take one last look at the world ere he closed his eyes forever. He lay on his back motionless, and apparently breathless, for the sound of his breathing could not be heard. Ever and anon, John placed his hand to his mouth, and felt the almost imperceptible current of air exhaling its last sighs, freighted with the departing spirit of the unfortunate soldier. Midnight came; the distant lamp shed a gloomy and uncertain light athwart the abode of despair, showing a long array of beds, that might aptly be called graves, for death inhabited them. No sound of life was heard, except the measured step of the sentinel above, passing to and fro, and the panting breathings, or low murmured moans of the tenants of the dungeon below. At this moment, the dying captain opened his eyes, and after gazing on John, at first with a stare of vacant doubt, at length spoke his last whisper. “Your hand, John, and place your ear close to my lips. May Heaven bless you, my parents, and my country. I have served her faithfully, and now I die for her. If I had only lived to see her free, I should die happy and content. But she will be free, so sure as there is a just God above. May that God receive my—” His voice became suddenly arrested—he cast one slow glance around—drew a long, quivering breath—then another—and then his last. Such was the end of the gallant old soldier, and such that of many, many other noble spirits, whose fleshly tabernacles mix with their parent earth, whose bones moulder in goodly fellowship together, and whose names now lay buried in oblivion on the shore of Long Island.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. A FUNERAL—A SUCCESSFUL PLAN OF ESCAPE—A NIGHT JOURNEY—ROBBING A HEN-ROOST—OUR HERO COMMENCES A PERILOUS VOYAGE, AND NARROWLY ESCAPES SHIPWRECK—A LONG WALK, AT THE END OF WHICH JOHN FALLS ASLEEP, AND THE GENTLE READER MAY FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE IF HE PLEASES. John mourned over his father, though his sorrows were assuaged by the thought, that he had gone from a scene of hopeless suffering to receive the rewards of an honest life and faithful services to his country. But it cut him to the heart to see his honoured remains carried the next morning, without shroud or coffin, wrapped in the blanket on which he died, to be buried, without a prayer for the repose of his soul. Not being, however, permitted, and, indeed, altogether unable from weakness to attend the ceremony, if that may be so called which was done without any of the usual accompaniments of Christian burial, he was spared the pain of seeing his father interred more like a beast of the field than a human being. In the course of time, however, he began to think of himself, his situation, and his future prospects. Gradually, as he recovered from the effects of his wound and fall, by the force of a most excellent constitution and a self-supported mind, he adopted a settled determination to escape from this den of misery the moment an opportunity offered, however desperate. Being now permitted to go on deck during the day, and obliged to take his turn at the pumps, which were perpetually going to keep the hulk from sinking, he found great relief from inhaling the breeze from the salt water, and regained his vigour surprisingly. Still, as during the mid-day heats, he sat, or stood at the pumps, panting and sweltering in the burning sun, without awning or protection of any kind, and looked at the green meadows and waving groves, that seemed almost within reach of his hand, his heart throbbed with indescribable yearnings to taste their refreshing coolness, and lay himself down in their shade. The deck of the Hunter was guarded during the day by vigilant sentinels, and at sunset the prisoners were all ordered below. Night was the only period that seemed to afford any chance of escape, and a few days observation convinced him even this was a forlorn hope. The passage leading to the upper deck was strictly guarded, and the old port-holes secured by strong iron bars. The result was a conviction that if he escaped at all, it must be from the upper deck, and to do this in the daytime seemed all but impracticable. True, he was an excellent swimmer; but unless he could get out of gunshot before he was discovered, the chances were a hundred to one that he would be killed by the sentinels, or overtaken by the boats before he reached the land. Night, therefore, was indispensable to his plan, but unless permitted to 5* remain on deck after dark, he saw little prospect of carrying it into execution. Still he cherished the design, and at length adopted a course which seemed to present a faint hope of ultimate success, if adroitly and patiently pursued. He began to distinguish himself at the pumps, by not only labouring with hearty willingness, but by taking the turn of some of the sailors. He was always in a good humour, jesting with his fellow-labourers, and conciliating the sentinels and petty officers by humourous stories or merry songs. Gradually, he established something like that good fellowship which admits a free interchange of sentiment and opinion. This brought him to the point he wished. He began to talk slightingly and sneeringly of his countrymen, and their cause, though it cut him to the heart to do so; adopted the phrase of rebels in speaking of them; affected to sympathise with his new associates, in exultation at the hardships they suffered, and every day gratified them by drawing extravagant caricatures of the rags, distress, cowardice, and disaffection of the soldiers of freedom. In speaking of their general, he always called him Mr. Washington, and sometimes almost choked himself by naming the rebel congress. His next step was to insinuate something like a willingness to change his colours, and serve under the banner of old England. He was tired, he said, of fighting for shadows, and receiving nothing but continental money for his reward. He affected to be convinced not only of the badness, but hopelessness of the cause, to the support of which he had been seduced by the precepts and example of his father; and finally consulted one of the sentinels, with whom he was most confidential, on the probability of being permitted to serve his Majesty, George the Third. By degrees he began to be viewed as a convert to loyalty, and by a course of judicious experiments, every day acquired new confidence, as well as additional freedom of action. On one occasion, he made a trifling bet that he would jump over the barricades, and swim around the Hunter in so many minutes, which he performed, to the great admiration of the spectators, and without any attempt to take advantage of the freedom thus permitted. This, and similar incidents, not only contributed to an increase of confidence, and a consequent relaxation of vigilance in the sentinels, but created a friendly and social feeling on their part, that greatly aided his final effort. He now began to be considered more in the light of a messmate, than a prisoner, and was permitted to remain on deck of evenings, after his companions had been ordered below, that he might amuse the sailors and petty officers with stories about the cowardly Yankees. This was what he had long been labouring to bring about. The crisis to which he so anxiously looked forward, had at length come, and he resolved to avail himself of it without delay. Accordingly, one calm evening, having been more than commonly severe and sarcastic on his countrymen, and actually persuaded the corporal of the guard to propose him as a recruit to the regiment of loyal Americans the next day, he set them all in a roar of laughter by a description of the manner in which a party of the rebels to which he belonged, had run away on a certain occasion. They insisted he should give them a specimen of the figure and gait of the Yankee captain, who he stated was lame of one leg, and limped in the most ridiculous style. At first he affected to demur, on the score of its impossibility; but being pressed on the subject, rose from his seat, bent himself almost double, and shuffling off in a gait which was applauded by bursts of laughter, made one leap over the stern of the vessel plump into the river. The moon shone bright as day, and the hulk, owing to the turning of the tide, lay athwart the river, her stern towards Long Island. The distance was not great, and his hopes were sanguine that he might reach the shore before a boat could be got ready to intercept his escape. Accordingly, he bent his sinewy limbs to his purpose, and, without pausing to look back, swam towards the land, while the shouts of approbation at his successful personification of the lame Yankee captain, still rang in his ears. In a short time, however, the merry party began to inquire what had become of him, and his friend, the corporal, going aft, climbed up the barricades to take an observation. The bright, glassy stillness of the waters, soon enabled him to discern our hero swimming with all his might towards the shore, and at once the whole truth burst upon him. Levelling his piece, he discharged a bullet, which whizzed past John's ears, and skipped over the surface before him. The report of the gun roused all hands; a fire was commenced that made his situation very critical, and a boat got ready with as little delay as possible, which started in pursuit of him. He could soon near the dashing of the oars; and the approach of his pursuers was announced by the sounds becoming every moment more distinct. Those who were not rowing, from time to time discharged their pieces, and the leaping and whistling of the balls told him they were within gunshot. He redoubled his efforts; he strained every nerve, and reanimated his remaining strength by the thought of the prize for which he was contending, and the forfeit to be paid for losing it. He could now distinctly hear the threats and maledictions of his pursuers, and occasionally tried to feel the bottom. But no bottom was to be found, and once more he tasked his vigour for a last effort. The boat now gained rapidly upon him; his limbs began to stiffen; his heart almost burst with the violence of his exertions, as well as the excess of his emotions, and once more he felt for the ground. He determined to let himself sink to the bottom, though ever so deep, rather than be carried back to the floating hell, from which he had just escaped. This time his feet touched the ground, leaving his arms, head, and shoulders above the water, and fortunately, the shore being very bold, a few steps brought him to the beach, so exhausted that he could barely stand. It was no time, however, for rest, and rallying the last remnant of his strength, he cried out to the party in the boat, “Good night, friends! what do you think of the Yankee captain's retreat?” and made the best of his way towards a wood, which he had often contemplated with longing eyes, from the broiling deck of the Hunter. His farewell was answered by a volley, which he luckily escaped, and he proceeded onwards, for some time distinguishing the voices of his pursuers behind him. At length reaching the wood, he sought its recesses, and soon losing the sound of their voices, sat himself down to reflect on his future course of proceeding. It cost him but little time to decide on making the best of his way until he came opposite the mainland beyond Harlem river, and there, if possible, pass over into Westchester county, either by the aid of some fisherman along shore, or by seizing a boat, should there be no other alternative. Should this resource fail him, he had nothing left for it but to hide himself, until an opportunity of crossing presented itself, or boldly attempting to swim over; for he was aware that he would be hotly pursued next day. It was, therefore, of the last importance that the mainland should be gained before, or at least by daylight, and soon as he was sufficiently recovered, and had settled his plan of operations, he set forth on his journey. He retained some recollection of the country, into which he had occasionally rambled in his school-boy days, and found his way with tolerable accuracy a distance of some miles, when he made the discovery that he was both hungry and weary—so weary, that he now for the first time became sensible that he had not yet entirely recovered the effects of his previous adventures and sufferings. He was now passing an old Dutch mansion, and though for the honour of our hero, we would fain bury the transaction in eternal oblivion, yet, does a scrupulous regard to that veracity becoming every writer of romance, impel us to the con fession, that on this occasion, either hunger, or some unknown diabolical influence, prompted our hero to the enormity of robbing a hen-roost; but justice imperatively requires that he should be acquitted of the grand larceny of carrying off the hens. He poached a few of the eggs to assist him in recovering his wind, they being, as is well known, a sovereign specific, and withal a very rare article at that time, either because the rebel pullets had come to “a strike,” or been nearly exterminated by the determined valour of the invincible red coats. Though John was not, perhaps, wise enough to teach his grandmother to suck eggs, he nevertheless well knew their renovating qualities, and cautiously entering the premises under sanction of the great law of necessity, was groping about to find the sanctum sanctorum of Dame Partlet, when the dead silence around was suddenly disturbed by the significant cackle of a wakeful old rooster, who, it is presumed, was deputed to mount guard in those perilous times. This signal roused the old lady, who was nestling at his elbow, and who answered by a few notes of interrogation, as much as to say “what is the matter, my dear?” The inquiry aroused the next neighbour on the other side; the question was rapidly repeated from one to another, and in a few moments the entire roost was in an uproar. The cocks screamed; the hens cackled; the ducks quacked, and threw up their eyes appealing to heaven for protection; an old Chinese gander, with a voice like the filing of a handsaw, sent forth a note that would have done credit to the Italian Opera, and was answered by a whole generation of curs, whose music roused a donkey, and incited him to join in the concert. Finally, the old patriarch of the whole tribe, Squire Van Dozer, who never before was known to open his peepers before daylight in the morning, did incontinently awake, and shoving up the window, poked forth a long duck gun, with which he might peradventure have done some mischief, had not fate decreed that it should flash in the pan. These accumulated warnings admonished our hero to cut a stick, and make tracks; and according to custom on such occasions, he decamped without beat of drum, carrying with him three eggs, for which, in common courtesy, we think posterity should forgive him, seeing that one of them turned out no better than it should be. All this consumed but a few minutes, and feeling himself wonderfully refreshed by his stolen eggs—which, like stolen kisses, are doubtless the sweetest—he continued his route, without further incident or adventure, until he passed the famous Helle Gatte, where so many gallant apprentices, and doughty school-boys of the good city of mud, dust, and brickbats, have run such imminent risk of being utterly shipwrecked on the Hog's Back, the foaming Gridiron, and the Boiling Pot. Being now near the spot where he contemplated crossing the East River into the county of Westchester, he skirted the beach, in hopes of finding a boat, which, not content with robbing the hen-roost, he was resolved to make free with, if necessary, without leave of the owner. For a while his search proved fruitless, but at length he had the good fortune to discover a little, light skiff, pulled up among the high salt grass, and half filled with water. There was a single paddle floating about in her, and it was doubtful whether, with this alone, he could manage to pilot his vessel across the strait, where the current is not only strong, but abounding in eddies. But there was no time to stand upon trifles, for the cool breeze which had succeeded the dead calm of the night, and the diminished lustre of the stars, admonished him the day was at hand. Stepping into the crazy craft, and pushing off, he brandished his paddle with might and main, making at first quite a reasonable progress, considering his boat was half full of water. But of all the rivers, inlets, straits, arms, bays or whirlpools on record, not excepting Charybdis and the Maelstrom, the East River, in this vicinity, is the most capricious and perplexing. The tide runs to every point of the compass, invisible to all eyes but those of the experienced pilot, and none can tell which way they are going, except by looking at the shores, and seeing them run away at the rate of ten miles an hour. It is the very pandemonium of waters; and, were this the age of any fables but those called emphatically humbugs, there would doubtless be as many water-fiends connected with this strait, as are to be found in the famous Hartz Mountains. In despite of all his efforts, he was at length sucked into the eddies of the Boiling Pot, whence, after whirling about at random, he was consigned to the martyrdom of the Gridiron, and finally into the Frying-Pan, where his frail barque continued to revolve in an endless circle. Never was man so bedeviled and bamboozled by eddies and currents, and counter-currents; and such became his perplexity and vexation, VOL. II. 6 that more than once he was sorely tempted to throw himself overboard, and take the chance of sinking or swimming. At length, however, by one of the caprices of the water-sprites, his boat was shot precipitately high and dry ashore, and he once again found himself on the soil of Long Island just as the sun rose. There was no staying here in safety, and tired as he was, there was absolute necessity for renewed efforts. Laying hold of the rope by which his skiff had been fastened, he towed it along the shore with great labour and difficulty, until he believed her beyond the insidious wiles of the diabolical strait. Then, grown wiser by experience, he did what he ought to have done before, namely, pulled the light skiff to the land, and turning it over, discharged its cargo of salt water. Again launching her on the waves, he had the good fortune to reach the opposite shore in safety, just as the proprietors of the boat discovered the liberty he had taken with their property, and were calling after him lustily, with many unseemly expletives, not worth repeating. He did not think proper to return their morning salutation, but fastened his boat securely, and pointing to where she lay, bowed his thanks, and made the best of his way towards home. Preferring the byways to the highways, least he might meet with some straggling parties of the enemy, he took his course along the bank of the little river Bronx, which flows through a retired part of the county, among hills, woods, and valleys, without meeting with any interruption. At length, finding himself excessively fatigued, and somewhat hungry, withal, he determined to seek refreshment and repose at an old, weather-beaten mansion, separated from the road he was travelling, by a long lane of nearly a quarter of a mile. It seemed retired and lonely, and he resolved to cast himself on the charity of its inmates, whoever they were. Approaching the house, he perceived a female face reconnoitring him from a broken window, and the sight of a woman seemed the signal of welcome. Meeting her at the door, he stated his wants, and after some little hesitation, she invited him in, saying in a tone of languid indifference, she would give him what she had. This was indeed little, and homely enough; but the hungry traveller is no epicure, and beggars should not be choosers; so he ate his allowance with a good zest, and thankful heart; while at intervals they talked of the times, and other matters, until they seemed almost like old friends. Each had paid a portion of the price of liberty, for one had lost a husband, the other a father, in the contest. At length he began to feel the effects of his exertions, and want of rest the preceding night, added to a fatiguing day's journey, for it was now verging towards sunset. He asked permission to lay down and rest himself, but she seemed unwilling to grant his request, and on begging more earnestly, shook her head, and replied: “It is dangerous to sleep here. The Skinners and tories sometimes pay me a visit, against my will, and you know what sort of people they are.” “I know,” said he, “the Skinners are the worst and basest of all God's creatures, a disgrace to their country, and a curse to this miserable district. Many of the tories are not much better; but I have nothing to lose but my life, and that I can defend against such cowardly villains.” After many entreaties, and much reluctance, she at length consented that he should go and take his rest in the barn, which stood at some distance from the house. Here nestling himself in the new-made hay, he dropped at once into a sleep, such as is seldom enjoyed on beds of down. The reader is strenuously advised to follow his example, that he may be better prepared for what follows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. A RETURN TO OLD SCENES—OLD SQUIRE DAY, AND YOUNG SQUIRE DAY—THE ART OF CHEAP LIVING—LABOUR-SAVING INVENTIONS vs. LABOUR—A LIE DETECTED BY AN EYE— A YOUNG WOMAN'S REASONS, AND AN OLD MAN'S CALCULATIONS—THE COLONEL CONSIDERS CERTAIN MATTERS DEEPLY, AND AS IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASIONS, DECIDES IN FAVOUR OF HIMSELF. It is now a long time since we lost sight of Jane Hammond, who was not a person to be neglected by writers having the least pretensions to gallantry; first, because she was a peerless little damsel; secondly, because she had lost one lover; and thirdly, because she had found another, which last is such a remarkable circumstance, that it deserves to be specially explained and developed. The old continental, as already stated, had in his visit to head-quarters, wherein, the reader doubtless recollects, he carried Pine's bridge sword in hand, ascertained that the story of our hero's desertion was a sheer calumny. His not returning from the expedition in which he wore that odious red wig, which had given Jane such dissatisfaction, was long since known to have been occasioned by having been surprised and captured; but what had become of him since, remained utterly unknown in the sequestered 6* spot, where dwelt those most interested in his fate. The general impression was, that he had probably perished under the hardships endured by those who were stigmatised as rebel captives. But no one knew this to a certainty, and the obscurity that hung over his fate, served only to keep alive in the heart of his mistress a keener anxiety, a more affecting remembrance. Time, however, that hoary-headed benefactor of the human race, who first soothes, and then obliterates the keen pangs of sorrow; who, as he passes through his never-ceasing round, covers the rough traces of the past from our eyes, and at last completes his benefactions by bringing us to the quiet grave;—time gradually exercised his balmy influence over the heart of Jane, who continued to grieve, but did not despair; and, as if to aid in his pious endeavours, a blooming youth appeared as an ally to the wrinkled scytheman. Old Squire Day, who is only known to the reader as an obstinate blockhead, according to the repeated declarations of the colonel, was gathered to his fathers, not long after the disappearance of our hero. Obstinate as he was, he could not hold out against the summons of him who conquers all, and yielded the citadel of life without argument, a thing he had never done before. We cannot learn that he performed any act, or decided any case in law or equity, which entitles him to the remembrance of posterity, and shall therefore refer our readers to his tomb-stone, on which the great Zoroaster Fisk exhausted his imagination in celebrating his virtues. His death was not of the least consequence to anybody except his nephew, namesake, and heir, young Squire Day, as he was called, who immediately came from a neighbouring town, the name of which, in imitation of the sage Cid Hamet, we don't choose to remember, to take possession of the estate. Artemas, as he was christened, was in good time visited by the colonel, and returned the visit promptly; here he saw our heroine, and became suddenly smitten with a golden arrow, not from the quiver of death, but Dan Cupid. In other words, he entered into a calculation, the result of which was, that the daughter and heiress of the richest old codger in the township, would be a capital speculation in time of war, when it was so difficult to make money in an honest way. He therefore at once set himself to work to make the agreeable, and succeeded so eminently, that Jane could not endure the sight of him ever afterwards. When he departed, the colonel pronounced him a puppy, and a blockhead to boot; while the daughter, after many pros and cons, decided that she had no opinion on the subject. He was sprucely dressed; his manners were about half way between a clodhopper and a dandy; his person was neither good, bad, or indifferent; his complexion was as rosy as a milkmaid; and the only legible word in the title-page of his face, was selfishness, imprinted in large capitals. There is no quality of the mind or heart that gives a meaner expression to the countenance; and Jane, though she had not seen enough of the world to institute comparisons, had been in the habit of contemplating a face where shone the most generous feelings, the most frank and manly expression of courage, sincerity, and honour. Besides this, it would seem, for we have often seen it exemplified, that there is an intuitive feeling in the mind of a sensible, high-souled woman, which supplies the place of experience, and at once detects the selfish hypocrite, who woos her for her wealth, not her worth. Thus, father and daughter agreed perfectly in opinion on a subject which does not always produce such unanimity; and we therefore record it as one of the remarkable circumstances of the times that tried men's souls. Artemas, however, soon repeated his visit, and the opinions of both remained unchanged. Still he continued his attentions, until it come to pass, that scarcely a day dawned over their heads, in which he failed to call, on some pretence or other. Sometimes he brought Jane a bouquet of flowers; sometimes a great, rosy-cheeked apple; and at others, a newspaper from New York, for her father, which generally set the old continental in a blaze of wrath, and caused him to Thunder and Mars it prodigiously, when he saw his countrymen called rebels, and General Washington Mister. The colonel was, however, a passionate, capricious gentleman; one of those old weathercocks, that veer about with the slightest change of wind; first, his self-love became by degrees conciliated by the attentions of his neighbour; then he began to think he had done him great injustice by calling him a puppy, and blockhead to boot, and it became his duty to make him amends; lastly, from becoming used to see him, he began to feel the want of his company, and consequently saw him with pleasure. The colonel boasted to Jane that he had overcome a prejudice; but the honest truth of the matter is, his self-love had interfered to reverse the honest decision of his judgment, in the first instance, which, in nine cases out of ten, is the true one, because it is not purchased by appeals to our vanity, or selfishness; but is, as it were, an instinctive impulse that seldom deceives. But the visits of Artemas had a directly opposite effect on the daughter, who found him every day more disagreeable. With that inspiration—for it can be nothing less—which enables the most thoughtless and inexperienced of the sex to detect the most latent indications, the most cautious approaches of a suitor, Jane had penetrated the motives of young Squire Day, while the old continental tickled his vanity with the idea that he himself was the sole attraction. There seems a repelling, as well as attractive power in love. It draws close to the object, if it be agreeable; while the attachment of one who is disagreeable, only tends to augment the antipathy. Such was the case with Jane. She might have endured the society of Artemas as a mere neighbour, or common acquaintance; but the moment she detected him as an admirer, she absolutely hated him. One reason, perhaps, was, he continually boasted of his intimacy with British officers, and was evidently infected with that inveterate disease of petty minds, the colonial feeling of inferiority, derived from long habit, and vulgar associations. He never displayed the least spark of patriotism, nor the slightest sympathy with the sufferings of his country. Thus, while he lost ground with the young lady, he gained ground with the old gentleman. He got the blind side of him, for there is an instinct in selfishness which, as it were, irresistibly impels it to study the infirmities of our nature for the purpose of appropriating them to its purposes. Artemas possessed this instinct in great perfection, and soon discovered the favourite hobbies of the colonel, which he assisted him in mounting on all occasions. The story of old Ti—the carrying of Pine's bridge sword in hand—the value of his property, which Artemas always greatly over-estimated, to the great satisfaction of the old continental—and above all, the inexhaustible subject of mole-traps, horizontal wheels, and perpendicular axle-trees, was kept constantly alive by the ingenuity of the young squire, who was ever forgetting or remembering something apropos to the matter. At length he overthrew the colonel horse and foot, and gained his whole heart by suggesting a great improvement in a fanning-mill, by which, he demonstrated, the labour of at least twenty men would be superseded. The good man determined forthwith to set about constructing this superlative machine, and from this time Artemas was lord of the ascendant. But for all this, the waters did not always flow smoothly. Artemas sometimes seriously annoyed the colonel by his fopperies. He had dubbed his domicil Dayspring House, in humble imitation of some of the aristocratic lords of manors in the county, and roused the rebellious feelings of the old continental by quoting Sir Somebody this, and the Honourable Colonel that, to show what great company he kept in the city, where, he boasted, he had liberty to go in and out at pleasure. On these occasions, the colonel would exclaim— “Thunder and Mars! what business have you to keep company with the enemies of your country, instead of looking them in the face on the field of glory? I begin to suspect you are a rank tory, for you seem to think more of Sir Henry Clinton than Washington, who is worth more than all the lords in England, and the Lord Harry to boot.” On the whole, however, Artemas gained ground daily with the old gentleman, who cherished not the most remote suspicion that his visits had any reference to Jane. But he could make nothing of that pensive damsel, who took every occasion to avoid his society; and without absolutely insulting a man in whose company her father took such pleasure, did all that could be expected of a reasonable woman to let him see that she heartily wished him with his favourite red coats, in the city. The young squire soon discovered his case was hopeless, unless he could bring parental authority to his aid; but so far from being deterred from pursuit by the difficulty of overtaking the game, he only became more persevering in running it down. That grovelling selfishness which was his ruling passion, became only more eager and more determined by the obstacles in the way of its gratification, and what he had at first only coveted from avarice, he now sought as a means of gratifying his revenge. One day, having brought the colonel into a perfect fool's paradise, by praising his system of rural economy, as well as his wonderful ingenuity in the invention of labour-saving machines, and wondering for the hundredth time at the affair of old Ti, Artemas thought he would break the ice a little so as to see the bottom of the water. “By the way, colonel, what a fine, handsome girl, is your daughter. I should like to cultivate her acquaintance, but am sorry to see the wish is not reciprocal. She seems rather to shun me, I think.” “Hem—Thun—” The old continental did not exactly like this speech. He had flattered himself he was the sole attraction that brought the young squire so often to his house, and now, forsooth, it appeared he was thinking of an ignorant young baggage who did not comprehend the mystery of a mouse-trap. His vanity was mortified, and he gave vent to his feelings in the preceding fragments. “I believe you have few neighbours, colonel,” continued Artemas; “I don't recollect to have seen a single young man since I came to reside here.” “Very few—they are all gone to the army,” where you ought to be, the colonel was about to add, but checked himself for once in his life. “I am told, sir, that the old people at the stone house yonder, have a grandson, a dashing young fellow in his way, but who has gone over to the royalists not long since.” “Thunder and Mars! who told you that, sir?” “I beg your pardon, colonel, I did not hear, I saw it with my own eyes the last time I was in the city.” “You saw it? when—how—where? Take care what you say, for if you speak truth I shall lose a son, and perhaps a daughter.” Artemas knew precisely the state of the case, and proceeded accordingly. “I would not assert, if I had not seen it with my own eyes. A tall, straight young man, with blue eyes, chestnut hair, and a scar just over his left eye.” “Ah! that's he! The young rogue got that when he cut down half a dozen rascally Yagers. Well, sir —Thunder and Mars! why don't you go on? You talk like a snail with his house on his back.” “Well, colonel, a scar just over his left eye. Such a young fellow I saw in British uniform, in company with other British soldiers, and was told he had enlisted in the corps of Loyal Americans, to escape being hanged as a spy.” “And his name?” asked the colonel, eagerly. Artemas repeated the name of our hero, and the frank, honest old continental was convinced. Instead, however, of being sorry for poor Jane, he grew angry with John, or rather impatient of the pain he himself suffered under a conviction of his apostacy. He had, by degrees, grown to have a sort of fatherly affection for our hero, and looked forward to calling him son, with something like pride, though it cannot be denied that he sometimes wished him as rich as young Squire Day. The sudden revulsion of his feelings carried all before it, and he was proceeding to stamp about, firing volleys of expletives against John, in a voice so exalted as to attract the attention of Jane in the chamber above, who came to inquire what was the matter. “Matter!” roared the colonel, “matter enough, and too much, too, for that matter. The young blockhead —the puppy—the rascal—the traitor—the deserter! I knew he hadn't the stuff to feel the gaff without putting up his sneakers and cackling.” VOL. II. 7 “What mean you, father?” asked Jane. “Mean? why—Thunder and Mars! I mean that young rascal who has made fools of both of us. I mean that puppy, John. Tell her all about it, squire, that she may cast him into outer darkness.” Artemas then commenced repeating his story, while Jane fixed her eye upon him with a steady gaze of ineredulity that penetrated the icy region of his mean, malignant heart, causing him to pause and falter as he proceeded. With all his efforts, he could not look her in the face; and when the tale was done, he stood like a convicted criminal before her. Without a word of reply she left the room, with a glance of such withering scorn, as would have annihilated any man not cased in the invulnerable armour of dogged selfishness. “Thunder and Mars! what does all this mean?” cried the colonel. “I expected to see crying and all that sort of thing. But so much the better. She is a chip of the old block, and scorns a rascally traitor to his country.” “Ye—e—e—s,” replied Artemas, in a faint voice, “she certainly don't care much about him;” and mounting his horse, proceeded towards Dayspring in a state of mind not to be envied, leaving the colonel more puzzled than he ever was in his life before. His daughter appeared the moment of his departure, and placing her hand gently in his, asked— “Father, do you believe that bad man?” “Why—why—hem—yes, I do. There was truth in his tongue.” “No, father—there was falsehood on his tongue, in his eye, and in his heart. I saw it there. Every word he uttered was false. John may be dead—but—but— he will never disgrace himself, or me. I will stake my life, and all my hopes of happiness, on his love and his patriotism.” “Stake a fiddlestick! what can you know about mankind in general, and this young puppy in particular? You don't dream of the number of villains that hide a false heart under a fair face.” “True, father—my dreams are only the reflection of my waking experience, which has taught me to trust my father as I would myself, and John as I would my father. I am sure neither of them will ever deceive me, and if they should, I will not believe it, even on the evidence of my own eyes and ears, for I should think they deluded me.” The testy old continental was touched by this declaration of implicit faith, for he loved a compliment, as dearly as he did his daughter. But it lost more than half its unction by being coupled with one whom he believed unworthy the association. “Jane,” said he, kindly, “you are a good girl, but a great fool, and take after your mother. What motive could young Squire Day—who is a very different man from that obstinate old blockhead, his uncle—have for belying the rascal?” This question caused great embarrassment, though Jane could have answered it satisfactorily, had she chosen. But a certain delicate, innate modesty, ever the inmate of a pure, unadulterated heart, stood in the way, and arrested her tongue. She remained silent and confused. “Answer me, Jane, what motive could he have?” “I don't know—sir—but I think—I suspect—he don't like John.” “Not like him! why, he never saw him in his life, except the other day in his red coat. What reason can he possibly have for disliking him? Come, Thunder and Mars! out with it!” “Why, sir—because—because—” “Because what? The deuce is in you, I believe.” “Because—he—he—lives so close by us, sir.” “Bravo!” cried the old continental, in a roar; “let any man tell me after this, that women can't give a good reason for anything. But seriously, Jane, I'm afraid it is too true.” “I don't believe a word of it, sir.” “Why not?” “Why, because—because, I won't believe it.” “Good—another capital reason. One would suppose you got them from a blackberry bush, they are so plenty this morning.” Jane burst into tears, and was leaving the room, when the colonel called her back, and kissing her affectionately, said in a more serious tone: “Suppose he proves this in black and white, hey? suppose he brings testimonials from New York, what then?” “I shall not believe them, father. The wretch who does not shrink from telling falsehoods, will not stop at forging proofs, or bribing witnesses, dear father! For the last four or five years, I have seen John almost every day. I have shared his thoughts—I have seen his heart and his mind, a thousand times naked before me, and if we cannot rely on such experiences, in the name of heaven, what security can we have for human virtue, or what reliance on kindred or friends?” “Well—there is something in that. But I ask again, what motive can Squire Day have for telling the tale, if it were not true?” “He—he—he—he,” stammered Jane. “He—what? you little goose?” “He wants to marry me himself;” and Jane ran out of the room. “Whew—w—w—Thunder and Mars! that alters the case,” and the colonel fell into a deep cogitation, during which he was sorely beset by the counteracting influence of Ebony and Topaz. The demon of self-interest, which is so often found lagging at the heels of old age, jogging its elbow, whispering in its ear, and jingling his money bags, to drown the still, small voice of conscience, now made a desperate assault on the old continental. He opened an account current, in which the balance preponderated mightily against our hero, and in favour of his rival. In short, he began to reason coolly on the subject; and, as we once heard a generous, warm-hearted son of old Erin affirm, the moment a man begins to reason on a subject in which his own interest is concerned, ten to one, he becomes more or less a scoundrel. The course of the old continental's calculation ran thus: John was poor, the squire rich, carry one in favour of the squire; one was a ship richly laden, the other not even in ballast, carry two; one was a prisoner, perhaps a deserter, the other a squire of high degree, carry three; one had no genius for inventions, 7* the other had taken out fourteen patents for labour-saving machines, carry fourteen; one was a bird in the hand, the other in the bush, carry two more; if Jane married Artemas, she would marry a good estate; if she married John, she would get nothing but a man, and a farm in perspective, carry six more. On the other hand, there was a contract of honour, but such contracts have no force in law, and besides, John being a deserter, as the colonel took for granted, on the present occasion, had been the first to violate it. Then there was the suffering of his daughter; but he passed that aside, as mere moonshine, as a rational woman would certainly in time learn to love her husband, provided he was not a baboon or a bear. While he was thus see-sawing on the line which separates right from wrong, and is no bigger than a hair, the aforesaid demon, that so often assumes the disguise of reason, impatient at his indecision, gave him a great push, and sent him at least sixteen yards beyond the dividing line, whereat the good gentleman was exceedingly relieved, inasmuch as the matter was now settled, and the balance so clearly in favour of reason and Artemas, that he resolutely determined to trouble himself no further in stating the account.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. A COUPLE OF INGENIOUS COMPARISONS WHICH IT IS HOPED THE READER WILL NOT PRONOUNCE ODIOUS—PROOFS THAT A WOMAN CAN GIVE EXCELLENT REASONS WHEN NOT UNDER COMPULSION—A VISIT, AND A DINNER—A YOUNG MAN OF SAVING GRACE—HOW TO TRAVEL CHEAP—MISCHIEVOUS EFFECTS OF MOLASSES AND WATER, COUPLED WITH A BAD DINNER. Colonel Hammond was a man of great ardour, but little perseverance. His inclinations veered round like a weathercock in a high wind, but never rested long at one point of the compass. His resolutions might be likened to a ball, which is precipitated from the mouth of a gun at a prodigious rate, but soon becomes spent, or, if it meets sufficient resistance, either glances aside or rebounds, and rolls directly the other way. The discharges of his passions, in truth resembled those of a cannon, being accompanied by a great noise and an immense cloud of smoke, one of which soon dies away in echoes, becoming weaker at every repetition, and the other is speedily dissipated by expansion. He was therefore always in haste to put his resolves in execution least he should change his mind in the interim. The moment of his decision in favour of the young squire, was, therefore, that of communicating it to his daughter, who was (as writers of romance presume to say of the women of other countries) actually struck dumb at the annunciation. When she at length recovered her speech, (for such unnatural paroxysms seldom last long,) she ventured to remind her father of his pledge to John, sanctioned by the word of honour of an old continental, and that John was now striving to fulfil his part of the contract. In reply, the colonel urged the truth of the information received from Squire Day, and Jane reiterated her conviction, that he carried falsehood on his lips, in his eye, and in his heart. The colonel maintained, that she knew no more of what a man carried in his heart than the old codger in the moon; and as to telling when he spoke the truth, she might as well look for it at the bottom of a well, or in Rivington's Royal Gazette. The old gentleman scolded, and Jane wept. He commanded her to marry Artemas Day, and she pleaded her promise to John. He swore by Thunder and Mars she should, and she passionately declared she could not, which meant neither more nor less than that she would not obey him, at least until satisfied beyond all doubt that John had proved false to his country and to her. “If he has,” exclaimed she, with streaming eyes, and proud desperation, “if he has, I care not who is my husband. I will marry old Mingo, if my father commands me.” “That's a good girl—now kiss me, and let us be friends.” Jane complied with rather a bad grace, and less affection than she had ever felt before. The colonel called for his horse, whose head he turned towards Dayspring, and his daughter went forth to the margin of the little river, where, in the midst of scenes associated with many a tender recollection, many hours of innocent happiness, she fancied she was striving to discipline her heart into obedience to the will of her father. But, strange as it may seem, the more she strove, the more obstinate that heart became, and she returned home, as she verily believed, out of all patience with the sturdy little rebel. Meanwhile, the colonel proceeded leisurely towards the abode of the young squire, and as he passed along by the side of his rich meadows, in which the lazy cattle reposed among luxurious beds of fragrant clover, in quiet abstraction chewing their cuds, or grazed knee-deep in the redundant timothy-grass; or cast an approving glance over the waving fields of golden grain, unscathed by the tempest of war, (for the prudent squire had a protection from the enemy,) he became more than ever determined to sacrifice his daughter to the golden calf in the wilderness. The two estates, adjoining each other, seemed predestined to matrimony; and the good gentleman had not the least doubt that this marriage, at least, was made in heaven. When he came into the presence of the thrifty young sapling, his thoughts had resolved themselves into something like the courtly speech of the nameless king, in Puss in Boots: “It will be your own fault, my lord marquis of Carabas, if you are not my son-in-law.” Artemas shrunk into the dark precincts of his narrow soul, when he saw the valiant old continental approaching, for his conscience whispered he was come to question him more closely on the subject of the apostacy of our hero. He, however, sleeked over his face with an insidious smile of welcome, and poured forth a profusion of civil speeches, such as the worthy old gentleman loved in his heart, seeing that age is so often neglected in this world, that nothing is more grateful than a little exuberance of attention, even when it lacks the salt of sincerity. Indeed, flattery is scarcely less agreeable from its want of truth, since it indirectly administers to our self-importance, by demonstrating that we are thought worth the trouble of deceiving. It administers at least to our pride, if not to our vanity, and gratifies that petty self-consequence which sticks like a burr to the skirts of insignificance. “I am delighted beyond measure,” cried Artemas, “at this friendly call. I hope you are come to dine with me, though, I regret to say, my cook is seriously indisposed, and you will have nothing but a cold cut. But an honest welcome is the best sauce to a bad dinner, and good wine needs no bush—though, I regret to say, that having scruples on the subject of drinking, I shall only be able to give you molasses and water, mixed with a little vinegar, which is the most wholesome beverage in the world. I have the finest spring in the county at your service.” This bill of fare did not much relish with the old continental, who despised cold cuts, and more especially molasses and water, from the bottom of his soul. After a few wry faces, and recollecting the importance of his mission, he acceded to the invitation, and recommending his horse to the special care of his host, was ushered into the house with great ceremony by the half-breed cockney. “By the way, colonel,” said Artemas, after they were seated, “if I recollect right, this is the anniversary of the capture of old Ti, and I must insist on your going through the whole siege after dinner.” “Thunder and Mars!” thought the colonel, “but the young squire is out in his chronology. He has got as far from the anniversary as from Jericho to Jerusalem. But so much the better; it proves that I have never told him the story, or that he has forgot it entirely. It will be quite new to him,” and the old soldier rubbed his hands in ecstasy. Previous to dinner, the young squire exhibited his labour-saving inventions, all of which indicated a pettifogging, parsimonious disposition, employed for selfish purposes. All were contrivances for saving money and labour; all originated in thrift, and each one superseded the labour of human hands. One would do as much threshing as half a dozen stout men; another cut as much straw in an hour as a man could in twenty-four; a third winnowed his grain at the saving of a great expense of time; and a machine for peeling apples was set forth as an invaluable expedient of economy. The colonel was at once beset by admiration and envy, for he could not but acknowledge his inferiority in the art of saving labour, and starving labourers. Following out consequences, he, at length, after a long pause, suddenly exclaimed— “Thunder and Mars! squire, there will be no use for men at this rate. What is to become of all the poor labouring people, if you do everything by machinery, hey?” “They can employ themselves in making and tending the machinery.” “But this won't employ them all, or there would be no use in machinery. What is to become of the rest of them?” “That is no business of mine, colonel. All I know, is, that it puts money in my pocket; and my maxim is, take care of number one. Charity begins at home.” “Hum,” muttered the old continental, who did not relish these sentiments any more than the cold cut and the molasses and water; for, with all his Thunder and Mars, he was at the bottom a kind-hearted man. He valued wealth, because it administered to his pride, rather than because he was avaricious; and could not help observing that the inventions of the squire were penny-saving contrivances, totally different from his own magnanimous machines, which were all directed against the inroads of various mischievous animals, and had for their object the greatest good of the greatest possible number of his fellow-creatures. He began to feel certain decided symptoms of contempt for his host, and determined to postpone his matrimonial overtures for the present. The dinner and conversation of the squire strengthened the growing disgust of the colonel. The former we will not particularize, least we should irretrievably disgust the connoisseurs in French cookery, and shall decline specification altogether, after merely hinting that, on the host boasting that a slice of pork, to which he helped his guest, once appertained to a swine that weighed upwards of eight hundred pounds, which he had fattened in a manner, the particulars of which we scorn to record, the colonel dropped his knife and fork emphatically, eyed the young squire with peculiar hostility, and with great difficulty refrained from blazing out Thunder and Mars. Meanwhile, the molasses and water circulated briskly, and it seemed that the more resolutely the guest declined tasting, the more keenly it was relished by the host, who appeared actually inspired by the exhilirating beverage. He became garrulous and communicative; told story after story, illustrating the triumph of meanness and cunning over simplicity and inexperience; and every moment waxed more vain of what would have caused a blush of shame on the cheek of an honest man, much more of a gentleman. Finally, as the climax of his triumphs, he boasted that he had several times travelled from his house to the city, and back again, a distance of some sixty miles, without expending a penny. “I filled my pockets with dried apples,” said he, “and whenever I felt a little hungry swallowed a piece or two, and then took a good drink of water. You know, dried apples when wet swell out enormously, and I did not require anything else for that day.” “And your horse—did he feed on dried apples, too?” “Oh! as for him, I have taught the creature to take care of himself. In the first place, he can travel a whole day without eating or drinking; and in the second place, I have only to turn him loose in the road, and if there is a good pasture in a mile round, he will VOL. II. 8 find his way there, I'll warrant you. He can pull down bars, or open a gate equal to any man in the county.” During the whole of this conversation, the colonel had discovered increasing symptoms of uneasy impatience. At every new display of the narrow, sordid, and dishonest mind of the young squire, he pushed his chair farther and farther from the table; and when Artemas concluded the eulogium on his horse, the triumph of his eloquence was complete. The old continental gave the chair one last decisive push, and rising abruptly from his seat, with an alacrity that seemed incompatible with his lame leg, made for the door without ceremony. “What's your hurry, colonel? Won't you stay and drink tea?” said the squire. “I have sworn never to drink tea until the British government gives up the right of taxing it,” said the old continental, proudly. “Well, won't you take a glass of buttermilk?” “Hum—” The colonel made him a profound bow, muttered something about returning his visit, dried apples, molasses and water, and buttermilk; and calling for his horse, rode home in a tempest of overwhelming disgust, which was increased, if possible, fourfold, when old Mingo pronounced it as his decided opinion, the colonel's horse had not had a mouthful to eat since morning, seeing he had debased himself by nibbling at the short grass in the court-yard. Jane received her father with fear and trembling, for she had suspected the purport of his visit. It was proper, however, to say something; and she at length ventured to inquire where he had been, adding dinner was waiting, but that she presumed he had dined. “Yes,” said he, “on fat pork, washed down by molasses and water.” “Why, where could you have been, sir?” “At young Squire Day's, who is ten times worse than that obstinate old blockhead, his father. The confounded skinflint! Jane, you shall never marry that mean, miserable, miserly, penny-saving machine— that molasses and water drinking trickster! I never knew a man with the soul of a half-starved caterpillar, contaminate his stomach with such stuff. Thunder and Mars! I say you shan't marry him!” “I don't wish to marry him, father.” “Why, Jane, he'd starve you to death; he'd feed you on dried apples; he'd convert you into a labour-saving machine, and all his calculations would be, how he could squeeze most money out of you. Damme, Jane, if I don't believe he'd cheat himself out of his own money, if he could find no one else to take in. There is no use in talking, I tell you, Jane. You shan't marry him, and there is an end of the whole matter.” “But, dear father, you forget; it was you that insisted on my having him. I'm sure I'd as soon marry old Mingo.” “Eh! oh! ah!” quoth the colonel. “Yes, now I recollect—John—oh! aye! Well, Jane, I never will believe that a fellow who eats dried apples raw, cheats his neighbours, starves his work-people and his horse, and drinks nothing but molasses and water, can tell the truth if he tries ever so hard. I am sure John is after all an honest lad, and you may love him as much as you please.” “Thank you, dear, dear father!” cried Jane, and she kissed the old continental just as if he had been somebody that shall be nameless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. A NAP SPOILED—SCENE IN A HAY-MOW—RUNNING A RACE AGAINST ODDS—A GHOST STORY, AND A SPECTRAL FIGHT— JOHN ESCAPES DEATH BY BEING NEARLY DROWNED—HIS RETURN HOME, AND WHAT HE SAW THERE—HIS DISINTERESTED SELF-DENIAL, AND WHAT HE GOT BY IT. The place where John stopped to rest, was some ten miles only from the abode of the old colonel; and if by chance any of our readers should accuse him of being a stupid, insensible block, for being able to sleep within so short a distance from the object of his dearest affections, after so long an absence, all we can say in his behalf is, that he was debilitated by long confinement and disease, that he had been up all the previous night, and had walked all day without food or rest. If these considerations do not secure his acquittal, or, at least, greatly extenuate his offence, we must leave him to settle the matter with Jane Hammond, the first convenient opportunity. We know that persons in love are said to be insensible to hunger, thirst, and fatigue, but it is an absolute fact that man must sleep sometimes, though it is considered rather common; and, being common, must of course be rather a vulgar business. Be this as it may, however, our hero did not wake 8* until long after darkness had enveloped the world in her mantle of obscurity. Nor is it probable he would have waked then, had he not been roused by the sound of voices in the stable directly under him. From the difference of tone and other peculiarities, he soon ascertained that the party consisted of at least three or four, and among them he was certain he recognised the voice of his old enemy, Case Boshin. Recollecting what the good woman of the house had told him of the frequent visits of the Skinners, prudence, as well as curiosity, impelled him to lay still and listen. At first he heard nothing but ribald jokes, mingled with loose profanity, and references to the outrages they had already committed or had in contemplation; but at length John was startled by a proposal that they should all adjourn to the hay-mow, and take a nap while the horses were feeding. This being carried, John thought it high time to take care of himself, as they were a desperate gang, and he could expect nothing but death from Case, on the score of old grievances. He had scarcely time to bury himself in the hay, with his mouth close against a wide crack which admitted the air, when the whole gang came and sat down within half a yard of where he lay. Here they began a consultation as to the propriety of going to sleep, as was at first decided; the result of which was, that they had better not, as they might oversleep themselves, and be too late for some adventure they had in view that night, but which they did not explain at the time. “It's a dry business to be waiting here without something so drink. I wish we had some of old Boshin's cider to comfort us now,” said one. “Well, Hanck, if we can't have the cider, suppose we get Case to tell the story of cheating the old man so famously when they were boys.” “Agreed,” rejoined Hanck. “Come, Case, tell us the story to pass away the time, while the horses are resting themselves.” Case then cleared his throat, and began as follows: “You must know, boys, the old man was a peeler himself at the spile, and betwixt him, and the old woman, and us boys, the cider used commonly always to run dry before Christmas; and as to buying any more, that was out of the question, for we had no money, and nobody would trust us. So the old man one time thought he would trick us all out of our share, by putting a lock on the cellar-door; and then he made a trap-door right under his bed, thinking we couldn't get in day or night unbeknown to him. Well, we boys one day laid a plot to out-general him, and git into the cellar. We were to wait till he began to snore, which he always did like a northwester—for we didn't much mind the old woman, who was plaguily sniffed at his contrivance to cheat us out of our share—and then I was to creep softly under the bed, lift up the trap-door, go down into the cellar with the great pewter mug, and hand up a mug of cider to each one in turn. Well, as soon as the old man begun to snore, what did I do but I creeps softly under the bed, lifts up the trap-door, goes down into the cellar, helps myself to a mug to make sure before the barrel gave out, and then begins to hand out the boys' share. When I got pretty nigh through the job, I whispered the boys the cider was jist out, when I'll be shot if the old man didn't put out his arm all of a sudden, and laying hold of the mug, swallowed every drop of it without fetching a single breath, only saying, `It's my turn, now, boys.' Then he laid down, and began to snore as if nothing had happened, and we all concluded he must have done it in his sleep, for he never said a word about it afterwards.” This story tickled the auditors so sensibly, that Hanck threw himself backwards in an ecstasy of laughter, and fell upon the spot where John lay ensconced beneath his covert. “I'm blasted,” exclaimed Hanck, “if I didn't feel something hard right under me,” and hastily removed from the spot. “Pooh! it's nothing but one of the beams,” said Case. “I'll see that, pretty quick,” rejoined the other; and seizing a pitchfork, thrust it into the hay with such good-will that one of the prongs ran betwixt John's fingers, which he spread out instinctively to defend himself. He had, however, the self-possession to lay perfectly quiet, and Hanck, satisfied with the experiment, returned to his seat, observing, that it was now time to set out on their expedition to the old stone house, by which name the residence of our hero's grandfather was known in that part of the country. John now listened with breathless anxiety. “Are you sure,” said Case, “that the coast is clear?” “Yes, just as sure as I set here. There is no one in the house but the old people, and a little gal; for you know the youngster is either dead, or a prisoner, or deserter, and we have nothing to fear from him. The old people can't defend themselves, nor the young woman, neither; and if they make a rout, we can soon stop their windpipes, I reckon.” “I 'most wish,” replied Case, “the young chap was there, too, for I owe him a grudge or two, and should like to pay him off with interest. If I ever get a good chance, if I don't make daylight shine through him, I'm a nigger. Is that captive horse there, he got from the Yagers?” “Yes, I saw him feeding in the meadow in front of the house, and by George he made my mouth water! He's a clipper, I tell you!” “Well, I dreamt last night, I was riding him to church one Sunday. You two shall have all the rest of the stock, and I'll take him for my share,” rejoined Case. “Yes,” said Hanck, “and I'll have a smack of the pretty gal to boot.” “No you won't,” cried another, “I speak for the first taste; Case shall have the next, so, you see, you are in Jack come last.” “I'm blasted, if I do!” rejoined the other; and a dispute commenced, during which, John listened with feelings that may be easily imagined. He comprehended the designs of these ruthless marauders, and knew full well they were capable of any atrocity. Like the savages of the wilds, they spared neither sex nor age, and being beyond the reach of law, despised all the restraints of conscience and humanity. Forgetting his own situation, he gave vent to his agonized feelings in a suppressed groan, that instantly arrested the ribald jesters, and smote their hearts with the terrors of conscious guilt. A dead silence ensued, until Case, the most reckless villain of the trio, at length whispered to his comrades— “Did you hear that?” “Yes, that I did,” said Hanck; “it sounded for all the world like the voice of a dead man.” “Let's be off like a shot, for I heard it thunder a great way off, and if it roars smartly the old folks may cry out and welcome, nobody will hear them.” “Nobody, but God!” cried John, in a hollow tone, taking a hint from the dastard fears of these guilty cowards, and following up the words by a long, deep groan, which sent the trio tumbling over each other out of the hay-mow in an ecstasy of fear. The moment they were gone he left his concealment, and seizing the pitchfork, after a brief consideration made for the road across the fields with all the speed in his power. The idea had occurred to him of cutting the bridles and girths of the horses, but unluckily he had no knife, and consequently he relinquished his purpose. To turn the horses loose was a dangerous experiment, as he could not tell but the party was lingering about the place; so he wisely took to his heels in hopes of reaching home before the villains arrived, in which case he was confident he could manage them, and with a resolution, if overtaken, to do his utmost to arrest their diabolical purposes. Fortunately for our hero, the affrighted Skinners ran to the house, where they stopped to tell the good woman what they had heard in the barn, and though she could easily have explained the mystery, she contented herself with opening her eyes, lifting her hands, and from time to time exclaiming, “Well, for the land's sake!” and, “Who'd have thought it!” thereby clearly demonstrating that a woman can keep a secret, at least in the new world. Having, however, screwed up their courage by means of a canteen of spirits, which commodity is said to be a special antidote to the fear of ghosts, the trio at length ventured to return to the stable in a body, escorted by the landlady, with a lantern made of a hollow pumpkin, where they saddled their steeds in great trepidation, mounted, and galloped away as fast as the increasing darkness would permit. These delays gave John the start some miles, and as the distance was not more than nine or ten to the old stone house, his hopes revived with his progress. The night had now become excessively dark, owing to the approach of a thunder-storm, and he could scarcely distinguish the road, except by occasional flashes of vivid lightning, followed by low, muttering thunder, at a distance. He durst not stop to listen, for moments were too precious; but at times he fancied he could hear the clattering of hoofs behind him, and his mind became busily occupied in devising a plan of defence, in the event of being overtaken. He still carried his pitchfork, and felt assured that, by choosing a favourable position, he could make good his stand against the odds of three to one. This was his only hope; for, save the ruins of a house that had been burnt by the enemy, there was no traces of a human habitation on this unfrequented by-road. There was no help, except in the strength of his arm, the firmness of his heart, and the blessing of heaven. He had now, as he discovered by the aid of a flash of lightning, arrived within a few yards of an old bridge, which spanned a deep and rapid stream, that by the labour of ages had worn its way through a ledge of high rocks, covered with gloomy evergreens. There was no passing the stream except over the bridge, the rocks on either hand being high and precipitous; and here, perceiving the enemy was now rapidly approaching, he determined to make his last stand. His first essay was to attempt pulling up some of the planks of the bridge, but they were too strongly fastened down to admit of this, and he resolved to resort to start-agem against such fearful odds. It was a retired, gloomy spot, such as where rustic chroniclers are wont to locate their tales of superstitious terrors, and already renowned in tradition for various unaccountable appearances, especially at night, for which the most approved soothsayers could not account on any rational principles. One of the best authenticated, was that of Mangham, the pedlar and tinker, and we shall give it here as a sample of all the rest. Mangham was a man of notorious veracity, and, on returning from a trip to New York, with his knapsack replenished by various articles suitable to the wants and vanities of the rural populace, met with the following extraordinary adventure: His pack was heavy, the day hot, and he had frequent occasion to stop by the way to quench his thirst with milk punch, which was his favourite beverage. Night was coming on apace, and fearing to halt for a lodging at any of the houses by the way-side, which were often infested by Skinners, Yagers, and other banditti fry, which roamed between the lines, he determined to push on to the abode of Colonel Hammond. Here he always found a welcome for his news, and he was sure of it now, for he had some papers of pins, a supply of needles, and other choice articles for Jane, purchased with money furnished by the old continental, who had a bad habit of paying beforehand. Accordingly, he continued on his way far into the night, and as near as he could guess arrived at the bridge, soon to be illustrated by the exploits of our hero, about the hour of eleven. Here, feeling himself greatly fatigued, and withal very thirsty, he set down his load, and proceeded to drink from the brook after the primitive fashion, that is to say, laying himself down at full length, and quaffing the current as it murmured by. But what was his surprise (for he declared he was not the least alarmed) to find that the moment his lips touched the water, he was saluted by a tweak of the nose that brought tears into his eyes, while at the same time the brook, instead of murmuring musically along as usual, grumbled out in a hoarse voice, “What business have you to drink my water?” The pedlar was at first somewhat indignant at this assault on his nose, which was a very goodly one, and somewhat rosy at the extremity. At first he surmised it might be a snapping-turtle, then a snake, and lastly a lobster, that is, a fresh water lobster; but when he heard the question, “What business have you to drink my water?” he abandoned all these theories as untenable. VOL. II. 9 Though no great scholar, Mangham was by birth a German, and as such, deeply imbued with the legends of Number Nip and the Hartz Mountain. He accordingly made up his mind at once that he was taking an undue liberty with an Undine, or some other pestilent damsel of the web-footed breed, and leaving his untasted draught, retired to the spot where he had deposited his merchandise at the corner of the bridge. He first thought of making the best of his way to the mansion of the colonel; but he felt so tired, he could not find in his heart to go any farther without resting, and the murmurs of the brook created an irresistible longing for a taste of its waters. In the midst of this conflict, he fell asleep with his head on his pack, and how long he remained thus he could not exactly tell; but this he could swear to, he ever and anon heard the words, “What business have you to drink of my water?” ringing in his ears, accompanied by a succession of tweaks at his nose that made his eyes wink though he was fast asleep. Every time the words were repeated, they became louder and louder, and the tweaks waxed more emphatical, until, at length, his nose was actually pulled off, which caused him suddenly to awake in great tribulation. The first object he recognised on opening his eyes, was an extremely ugly old woman, whose face, being illustrated by the beams of a full moon, was marvellously imposing, as she held up his nose in her hand with a look of diabolical triumph. She had evidently just emerged from the stream, for the drops trickled from her long, green locks, which sparkled like quicksilver in the beams of the moon. One of these drops happening to fall on his hand, immediately raised a blister, it was so hot, which made him conclude the old woman came from a place which shall be nameless, and was no better than she should be. He was now, as he confessed, very much frightened, and would have ran away had it not been for leaving his nose behind. “You drank my water,” at length screamed the old woman, “without asking my leave, and I have taken your nose in payment, though, ifegs, it's no great bargain, for it's the ugliest piece of furniture I ever seed.” The old woman, it will be perceived, was no great scholar. But however that may be, the pedlar became somewhat wroth at this reflection on his nose, of which he was excessively vain. Anger being the father of valour, this attack on his proboscis caused Mangham to feel somewhat pugnacious, or, as he used to express it, “a little wolfish about the ears.” Instead of apologizing for his offence, and then vindicating his nose, he began at the wrong end—he put the cart before the horse, and maintained that his nose was as goodly a nose as any in the whole county, not excepting her own. Finally, he pledged his veracity that he had not tasted a single drop of water, and demanded the restitution of his nose on the ground that he had not got value received for it, and consequently the whole transaction was illegal. “Heigh for a fiddlestick's end!” exclaimed the Undine old woman. “Here's a pretty kettle of fish about one of the ugliest noses that ever disfigured `the human face divine,' as the poet says. It would disgrace the snout of a pig. But I am a goddess of few words, and always speak to the purpose. The short and the long of the business is, that I must have the rummaging of that pack of yours, and the privilege of selecting such articles as I choose, without paying for them, or I swear by my fins you shall go without a handle to your face all the rest of your life.” Finding, after a succession of most humble appeals, reinforced occasionally by various cunning devices to overreach or intimidate the old woman, that it was vain to appeal to her pity or her fears, and horror-stricken at the idea of going home without his nose, the poor pedlar at last assented to the terms of the paction, and permitted her to rummage his pack at discretion. The envious old creature selected all the little articles purchased for Jane Hammond, with the money furnished by the colonel, and having satisfied herself fully, in order to show herself a woman of her word, stuck the tinker's nose on again as fast as though it had never been removed. Then wishing him joy on its recovery, and sprinkling him with a few drops of hot water which she shook from her green locks, she wished him a pleasant journey, and told him to march about his business without looking behind him, if he knew when he was well off. When Mangham arrived at the house of the colonel, and in order to account for not bringing the articles ordered for our heroine, related the preceding story, the old continental laughed full two hours, and affirmed, by Thunder and Mars, that never was so capital a nose so cheaply purchased. He forgave him his debt, and poor Jane lamented nothing so much as the loss of the needles and pins, which were worth about their weight in gold at that time. Many people doubted this rencontre with the Undine, but our own opinion is, that this old lady was one of the nymphs celebrated by the ancient poets, who, in the lapse of so many centuries, had lost her beauty, forgot her grammar, outlived her good manners, and expended all her integrity in gaining an honest livelihood among Christians. It was at this elfin spot, so memorable in the biography of the tinker, that John had now determined to make a stand against the Skinners, in defiance of the old woman and the black fiddler, who had more than once been seen playing there, accompanied by a shaggy bear, who danced almost equal to Fanny Esler, and a great, whiskered, bandy-legged turnspit, who beat time with his tail with all the inimitable grace of a leader of the band at an Italian opera. Armed with his pitchfork, and equipped in his old white muslin suit, a little the worse for wear, it must be confessed, he stood at the front of the bridge waiting the coming of the midnight ruffians, whom he could not outrun. They gained the bridge almost the instant he had taken his post; but the moment they distinguished his dingy white figure through the gloom, predisposed by the groans in the hay-mow, they suddenly halted, wheeled about, and, with the exception of Case Boshin, made a precipitate retrograde movement. Even the redoubtable Case, after standing his ground a few moments, his teeth chattering in his head, followed the 9* example, exclaiming aloud at intervals, “Where are you running to, blast your eyes?” “Didn't you see it?” answered Hanck. “See what, you sneaking ninny?” “Why that there white thing standing on the bridge.” “Pooh! 'twas nothing but the post.” “The posts are as black as my hat. There! there! I saw it by that flash of lightning as plain as I see you,” persisted Hanck. “I'm for going back for my part. We shall have a pelting shower soon, and I've no notion of getting a wet jacket to-night.” “If it storms, so much the better,” replied Case; “there will be no scouting parties out, and the coast will be clear. Come along, you cowardly fools; follow me, I'm not afeard of Spooks.” Saying this, he spurred his horse once more towards the bridge, and the two others, ashamed of their fears, or afraid to stay behind, unwillingly followed, for cowardice is felt as a disgrace even among those who have lost all other manly feelings. John, who had noticed the retreat and divined its cause, took a hint from their fears, and as they were just on the point of planting their horses' hoofs on the bridge, gave them a perfect fac-simile of the groan he had uttered in the hay-mow. It was a groan so sonorous, so sepulchral, and unearthly, that it startled the very silent night, and roused the sleeping echoes of the rocks around. It was too much for the nerves of these midnight marauders, and, as if by one impulse, they one and all scampered away the road they came without once venturing to look behind them. As, however, the distance increased, their courage again began to revive, and reflecting that there was no other road by which they could accomplish their design that night, they once more halted and sought to disguise their fears by bantering and joking each other, until, by degrees, they once more plucked up the courage to advance. Our hero heard their approach, though he could not yet see them in the pitchy darkness, which increased every moment as the storm began to howl at a distance. The first hoof planted on the bridge, was the signal for springing forward and darting his weapon in the direction whence the sound proceeded. They were all advancing abreast, and the only effect of this movement, was grazing the skin of Hanck's horse, who suddenly reared and threw him, but without any serious injury. The storm having now passed off in another direction, and the moon occasionally peeping out from behind the clouds, afforded the combatants opportunities of seeing each other at intervals. The Skinners, being soon convinced it was no ghost they had to encounter, but a thing of real flesh and blood, became only more bold and ferocious in consequence. They demanded, with oaths and threats, that he should let them pass; but he made no reply, and continued to stand on the defensive. Enraged at this interruption, which so greatly impeded their meditated plan of robbery, the party now dashed forward, and a furious contest ensued. The weapon of our hero, being none of the sharpest, and his thrusts often made at random, while the moon passed behind a cloud, were sometimes spent on the air, an anon glanced aside from the tough skin of the horses; while the others, being only armed with broadswords, were cautious how they approached him. In this way, the fight continued for some time without either party sustaining any material injury, when, as fortune chanced, or fate decreed, the weight and violent action of the horses proved too great for the crazy old bridge, one of the planks of which suddenly gave way under him, and our hero, falling through, remained for a brief moment supporting himself by his arms. While in this situation, and before he could recover himself, he received a blow on the head from a broadsword, which inflicted a severe wound, and so stunned him that he lost his hold, fell through the opening, and was carried away by the stream. The marauders, now freed from their unknown antagonist, proceeded forward with all speed on their destination, leaving poor John “alone in his glory.” Being prevented from sinking by the force of the current, he was carried some hundred yards down the stream, and finally deposited on a little point of land, projecting outwards, and forming an eddy on the lower side. Here he lay unconscious of his situation for some time, his body floating, his head resting on the sloping sand. By degrees, however, he at length, in some measure, regained his recollection, and was able to drag himself entirely out of the water, the coldness of which had in a great measure staunched the bleeding from his wound. Collecting his benumbed faculties, he at length attempted to rise, but it was only after repeated efforts that he succeeded, and when he did, his head became so dizzy that he fell to the ground again. Still, animated by the hope of saving his home from plunder, and its aged inmates from violence, perhaps murder, he repeated his efforts, and at length found himself able to walk feebly onwards. Not knowing how long he had remained in a state of insensibility, he was unable to judge whether it was now possible to reach home in time to arrest the scheme of plunder; but at all events he determined to try, and regaining the bridge, he seized his trusty weapon, and set forth with all the speed in his power. But spite of all his efforts, his progress kept no pace with his wishes or his exertions. He was often obliged to stop and take breath, and his weakness at every moment was augmented by the blood that now trickled from his wound, while the bitter consciousness that every moment of delay might enable the plunderers to accomplish their purpose, distracted his mind and enfeebled his body. Every instant he expected to meet them on their return, and felt that in his present condition he was entirely at their mercy. He, however, proceeded onwards without encountering that peril, until, just as the rising sun glanced his golden beams athwart the dewy fields, he found himself looking from a rising ground down into the smiling vale where nestled his long lost home. He saw the moss-covered roof of the old stone house, standing in all its loneliness; but no smoke rose from out the chimney-top, as was wont at that hour, and the absence of this token of life and animation smote like the cold hand of death on his heart. As he gazed around on the fields, he saw neither cattle or sheep, and the conviction rushed on his mind that he had come too late. He approached the door of the once peaceful mansion with fearful anticipations, and found it standing wide open. He looked in, and saw a sight that thrilled his very soul with mingled anguish and bitter revenge. The good old housewife was sitting, with the head of the old man resting in her lap, while his body lay extended on the floor, which was covered with blood. A plaintive moaning announced that he still lived, but the wife was silent as the grave. Her pale, wrinkled face, was turned towards heaven, as if appealing to its justice, or in humble resignation to its decrees; her few gray hairs were without the accustomed covering, and she neither complained or wept. As John stood contemplating this scene of wo, incapable of moving, and almost lifeless, she drew a long, deep sigh, and at length murmured, as to herself, these melancholy words— “My son is dead, my husband is dead, and John will never come home again. Why, O Father of mercy! why can't I die too?” In an instant John was on his knees by the side of his grandfather. “Mother!” cried he, for he remembered no other, “mother, see! I am come home, never to leave you alone again, so help me heaven!” She looked at him wistfully, as if scarcely recognising the speaker, or comprehending his speech, and seeing the bloody gash in his head, murmured as to herself— “More murder—more murder—all but me can die!” John took her cold, withered hand, and wept over it. There is a magic power in tears of heartfelt sympathy, that communicates with the hearts of others, and awakens even despair to recollection. She looked in his face a while, and by degrees recognised her grandson. “Oh! John! John! why did you leave us here all alone? See what has come to us,” and she pointed to the bleeding head in her lap. This recalled him to a sense of the necessity of action, rather than the indulgence of unavailing sorrow. He perceived the old man was not dead, and lifting him tenderly in his arms, placed his body on a bed, and, as well as he could, bound up the wound. He looked round for something else which might administer to his aid, but the room was a scene of utter desolation. He saw no means of comfort or revival to the aged victim, whose low moans smote him to the heart, and with sudden determination, addressed his grandmother— “I will return in a few minutes,” said he, and took his way towards the house of Colonel Hammond, fast as his waning strength would permit. He soon reached the spot, and knocking at the door with eager impatience, it was opened by a sweet vision, that broke upon him like a pale aurora out of the morning mists. She screamed at the sight of the bloody spectre, and was about to call her father, when a well-known voice arrested her steps. “Jane! dearest Jane! have you forgotten me?” Jane did not, she could not reply, for her voice was smothered in his bosom for some brief moments, after which she raised her head, and as she scanned his pale face and wretched attire, spotted with blood, asked with a gush of tenderness— “Oh! tell me where you have been, and what has happened to you?” “Not now—I have other things to tell you, and must not lose a moment.” He then briefly and hurriedly related the incidents we have just described, and the reason of his unceremonious intrusion, while Jane, overpowered by the force of love and pity, wept once more on his bosom. “Thunder and Mars!” exclaimed the colonel, who was just emerging from his dormitory, “What is all this? Who are you, sir? and what are you about, madam?” “Father,” answered Jane, for it is the privilege of the sex to speak first, “father, don't you know him?” “Not I. Thun—my acquaintance is not so extensive among such kinds of gentry, as yours, it seems. But, hey! what! now I come to look—why, zounds! if I don't believe it's that puppy, John! Give me your hand, boy. I'm right glad to see you, especially as you don't wear a red coat, I see. But where have you been? what have you been doing? what brought you here in such a trim? and—and—Thunder and Mars! why don't you speak, you blockhead?” John then made known his errand, and to do him justice, the colonel sympathised deeply in his tale. “But no use in talking,” cried he, “something must be done at once. I know a little of flesh-wounds, myself, and will order my horse and go with you. In the meantime, we must send for Doctor Foster, who stops bleeding with three leaves—and—and—what shall we do, Jane?” “If you will permit me, father,” answered Jane, blushing a little, “I will go over myself, at once, and take such things as may be useful; you know I am an excellent doctor, sir!” “I know you are an excellent nurse, and that is worth all the doctors in the land,” replied the colonel, affectionately. Jane proceeded to collect various articles, with which, all women whose education has been properly attended to, know so well how to administer to bodily suffering, and while the colonel was waiting for his horse, accompanied our hero on her errand of mercy. During the whole of their walk, it is our solemn belief they never once thought of themselves, except just in passing through a little grove, whose wicked twilight seduced them for a moment along a narrow path, which shortened the distance materially, they came so close together, that the young man could not in good manners avoid pressing his companion to his heart, and imprinting a kiss on her lips, for which, we hope heaven and our female readers will forgive him. On their arrival, they found the little maid, who had been reared in the family and become a part of it, having been frightened away at the first alarm of the Skinners, was now returned, and had resumed her household duties. With her assistance, everything was done for the poor wounded old man that seemed necessary, or was within their reach; the colonel arrived soon after, and afforded the aid of his experience, and Doctor Foster in good time made his appearance. But as the wound had already ceased bleeding, he found no opportunity of demonstrating the efficacy of the magic leaves, and all he could do was to insist VOL. II. 10 upon it, that, had he been called in time, he would have stopped the blood to a dead certainty. We will not tax the patience of the gentle reader, by detailing the process by which the old man was slowly rescued from the grave, by the gentle ministration of Jane, the sage advice of the colonel, and the providential absence of Doctor Foster, who was confined to his house by an attack of inflammatory rheumatism. The good patriarch was cured of his wound, but never recovered from its effects. His mind was irretrievably gone; and during the brief remaining period of his life, his only occupation was rambling about bareheaded, in storm and sunshine, picking up chips and sticks, which he would bring in and lay on the fire, muttering to himself, “Yes—yes—a tory is a highway robber.” The Skinners, it seems, had arrived about an hour after midnight, and while two of them were collecting the spoil out of doors, the third plundered the house within, at the same time heaping insult and outrage on the helpless old couple. Aged and decrepid as he was, the good man possessed a portion of that spirit which had descended to his son and grandson. He could not resist, but reproached the robber as an enemy to his country and his God; as a brute, who disgraced the name of man; as a coward, possessing only the courage to war on women, children, and old age; as a midnight thief, who dared not fight either for or against his countrymen in the face of day, and lived by the plunder of pig-styes and hen-roosts. Irritated by these cutting reproaches, Case Boshin, for he it was, struck the old man across the head with his cutlass, and though he came short of murdering his body, forever robbed him of the divinity of mind. The wife never thoroughly recovered the shock of that terrible night; the mouldering tenement had received a rude jostle that shook it to the foundation, and it became evident, that, as the ancient pair had travelled the devious journey of life for more than threescore years together, so in their deaths they would not be long divided. In this state of things, it was impossible for our hero to think of resuming his military career, even had he not bound himself by a promise not to leave home for any length of time. Indeed, his personal labours were now indispensable to the subsistence of the family. The cattle had been stolen from the fields, and the house rifled of all that was valuable. True, the old continental generously offered to supply all that was wanting, and more besides; but John at once almost sternly rejected his kindness, and he went away in high dudgeon, denouncing him as a purse-proud, beggarly puppy. But Jane—the gentle, delicate, generous Jane! John could not be offended with her, when almost every day she brought or sent some little comfort or convenience, not of sufficient value to load him with the weight of obligation, but still enough to call forth all his gratitude. Still, he continued rather restive under this system of persevering benefits, and more than once did the noble-hearted girl feel her heart swell with mingled sorrow and indignation, under a vague suspicion that he did not value her sufficiently to permit her to become his benefactress. She fancied, too, that he did not seek her as eagerly or as often as usual, nor welcome her with the warmth he used to do, previous to his last long absence. Her heart did not deceive her; for the sense of pecuniary obligation is not favourable to love, which is a strictly democratic principle, and thrives best in the generous soil of equality. One evening, when all immediate apprehension for the life of his grandfather had subsided, John had walked over to the colonel's, and was now for the first time questioned as to the cause of his long absence. He accordingly entered into a full detail of his adventures, whereat the old continental uttered many a “Thunder and Mars,” and his daughter, many an exclamation of apprehension, wonder, and delight. It would be utterly belying the heart of an old soldier to deny that the story of his sufferings, his steadiness, gallantry, and patriotism, did not greatly raise him in the estimation of the colonel; and it would be a still more atrocious slander of the heart of woman, to insinuate that every hardship he endured, and every danger he encountered, did not endear him still more to the colonel's daughter. “By the memory of the immortal Wolfe!” cried the old soldier, when he had done, “By the memory of the immortal Wolfe, but this beats the siege of old Ti! Thunder and Mars! I've a great mind—hum—” “To do what?” asked Jane, with a bright, speaking eye. “I've a great mind to give—hum—” “To give what, father?” “I've a great mind—yes, Thunder and Mars! I will—hum—” “Will what, dear father?” “Why, zounds! marry you to this puppy, as soon as we can find a parson to do the job. Hey, John! what say you to that, dummy, for you seem to have lost your tongue in the last two minutes?” John, as most of our readers will probably decide, proved himself on this occasion a great blockhead, in not jumping at this offer as eagerly as he did from the stern of the old hospital-ship; and we frankly confess, that when we came to this point in his history, we felt a great inclination to discard him forever from our good graces, and let him float quietly the rest of his way to oblivion. Reflecting, however, a little more deeply on the subject, it occurred to us, that, inasmuch as a faultless hero was a monster, a perfect lusus naturæ, on the whole we decided to finish his biography. The truth is, he belonged to that strange, perverse class of people, who feel a great deal more pleasure in conferring than receiving benefits. In fact, he was naturally excessively proud; and what heightens the enormity of this fault, he had become only the more so, since the distance between himself and his mistress had been increased by the losses lately sustained by his family, and the little obligations conferred on them by Jane. He felt the weight of his inferiority of position, and it had become a settled principle in his mind, never to claim the promise of the colonel until he had fulfilled the conditions on which it was made. This is all we can allege in his behalf, and with this explanation we resign him to the mercy of the judicious and gentle reader. Instead of accepting promptly, and expressing his 10* thanks with all the eloquence of profound gratitude, he muttered, and stammered, and coloured, and exhibited a degree of embarrassment perfectly inexplicable to the colonel and his daughter, one of whom eyed him ferociously, the other with indignant amazement. At length he managed to stammer— “Colonel Hammond—I—I cannot express my gratitude.” “Then hold your tongue, sir, or say something that people in their senses can understand.” “Nay, hear me, sir. You once told me I was a beggar, and that the only daughter of Colonel Hammond should never unite herself to a man without fortune or reputation. I had neither one nor the other, then; I have, if possible, less of either now. I promised you, that if heaven spared me, and opportunity offered, I would make myself worthy of Jane, and at that time I thought I could keep my word. But my prospects are now more gloomy than ever. The little property I might have expected to inherit, is desolated, and what is of yet more consequence, the situation of my grandparents is such, that I cannot, I will not leave them now, to seek my fortune in the service of my country. No hope remains that I shall ever be able to fulfil my part of the conditions, on which, alone, I can consent to receive the greatest blessing of my life; and without this, I have solemnly sworn never to claim the hand of the only woman I ever loved, or can love. I must fairly win her—I must feel that she does not sink in the world when she becomes mine, or mine she will never be, though I would move heaven and earth to win her.” “And so, sir, you refuse my daughter, do you? Very well—I say no more—there's the door. Do you understand?” exclaimed the colonel, as he shuffled to the door, and threw it wide open. “When you come to reflect on my motives, sir—” “Reflect! Thunder and Mars! what's the use of reflecting, sir? The thing is perfectly plain. You have rejected the only daughter of Colonel Hammond, an old continental, and the richest man in the whole township. I comprehend that perfectly, and as to your motives, I don't care a straw about them. There's the door, sir!” The colonel then bustled out of the room in a fury, leaving our hero alone with Jane. “Jane—dearest Jane! you, at least, understand me, I hope?” said John. Jane made no answer, but as she followed her father, gave him one look which the young recreant remembered for many a day. It was not precisely such a look as she bestowed on Artemas Day, with which she annihilated all his hopes at one blow, but a glance of mingled reproach, wounded pride, and sorrowful anger, such as, when it flashes from the eye of one we love, cuts deep into the heart. Jane was a woman, not quite an angel, and there are so many reasons deeply mortifying to the sex, and dishonourable to man for the course pursued by our hero on this occasion, that we think Jane may be excused for ascribing to want of true affection, what in reality proceeded from the highest, purest sources of virtuous love. She was wrong in this, and it remains to be seen whether she will ever come right again. John was actually confounded at the result of his magnanimous forbearance and self-denial. He remained some time where he was, either from not exactly knowing what to do with himself, or from a latent hope that Jane would return. But she came no more; and at length he slowly took his way towards his disconsolate home, occupied by a strange medley of feelings. He had, without doubt, from sheer ignorance of the workings of that incomprehensible machine, the human heart, flattered himself that his heroic disinterestedness would have won the admiration of his mistress, and the applause of her father; but he had been turned, as it were, out of doors by the colonel, and had received from Jane a look that spoke volumes, not of approval, but reproach, and—he could not tell what besides. He tried to persuade himself he was an injured man, and such attempts are seldom unsuccessful. This conviction is always a source of great consolation, and accordingly as he proceeded on his way, his chest gradually expanded, he held his head higher, his step became more elastic, and his form assumed additional dignity. In short, he had made friends with himself, and the alliance sustained him against the censure or disapproval of others. Our heroine, in the meantime, had retired to her chamber. She did not weep, for pride came to her aid; and whatever severe moralists may say, “pride oft keeps men, and women, too, from falling.” At first her feelings partook more of indignation than of disappointed hope, or wounded affection. She called to mind all she had felt and suffered for the ungrateful youth; how she had mourned his supposed delinquencies, sympathised in his sufferings, wept over his captivity, scorned his calumniators, and strange to say, these recollections, instead of hardening, softened her heart. They brought her back into her wonted state of feeling, and before pride could put in another word, or was aware of the trick her heart was playing her, the little bosom traitor gradually lured her back again to her old accustomed love. Then, taking advantage of this cessation of hostilities, he solemnly assured her that this imaginary rejection, was the best possible proof of the purity of her lover's passion. It demonstrated his disinterestedness beyond a doubt; it showed he loved her better than himself, and that he was capable of every sacrifice, but that of her respectability and happiness. “What a fool I have been,” thought Jane, and burst into a passion of tears. “It is all over now. He is as proud as Lucifer—how I do hate proud men. He will never come here again, unless he is sent for; he will wait a long time before I send for him. But he is poor; and after all, pride is the best safeguard of poverty, and makes it respectable. I would not give much for a man without pride, for my part. Oh! if I could only see him once more, just to explain that look I gave him—I wish I had been blind just then; but he'll never come near me again, with that confounded pride of his—and I, forsooth, am expected to make the first advances—I'll be switched if I do—I'll see him in Guinea first—I will never speak to him again, unless he goes down on his knees, and begs my pardon for rejecting me.” This single word, rejecting, grated so harshly on her feelings, that it did John's business for that time; and thus ended her soliloquy. The month of September now came round on the ever-rolling wheels of time, and every one at the old stone house being as well as could be expected, John felt the weight of inaction every day more intolerable; especially as the sight of the colonel's chimneys operated as a perpetual incentive to activity and exertion, by which alone he could hope to win his mistress with honour to himself and her. He had solemnly covenanted with himself to do this; and although most people do not much mind breaking faith with that worthy gentleman, John had too many motives for keeping it, to admit of such delinquency. As he could not join the army, for reasons already stated, all that was left him was to make occasional excursions with some of the young fellows of the neighbourhood, in the hope of serving his country by intercepting straggling plunderers, or giving information which might be useful to the cause to which his whole soul was devoted. One of these occasions led to an adventure which produced a sudden change in his prospects, and demonstrated that though chance may present opportunities for acquiring distinction, they can only be appropriated successfully by courage, integrity and patriotism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. SKETCH OF A SEPTEMBER MORNING—A GROUP OF STRANGERS INTRODUCED—THE GAME-CHICKEN AND HER COMMANDER— UTILITY OF MUSIC—A RIDE AND A DIALOGUE—QUAKERS MILITANT—DIFFICULTY OF THREADING A NEEDLE. It was one morning just before the peep of dawn, as the full moon was hovering over the high, precipitous mountain that skirts the noble Hudson on the western bank, between Tappan Bay and Haverstraw, that a group of three persons was standing on the beach, preparatory to embarking on the river. The wide expanse of waters presented the aspect of a magnificent lake, sleeping still and calm, awaiting the approaching morn; the range of mountains to the north, was decked with a white night-cap of mist, while the banks of the river below, lay half hid, half revealed in the obscurity of distance and night. The only object visible on the wide expanse of waves, was a large ship, whose dark hull, and lofty masts, were somewhat indistinctly seen some miles below. All was silent and motionless, save the group of living beings on the beach, one of whom wore a blue surtout; the other, the dress of a plain, country gentleman; and the third, a pea-jacket, and tarpaulin hat, from under which strayed a profusion of matted gray hairs, that seemed not to have been fretted by comb or brush for many a day. “Come, bear a hand, Arthur—there is no time to be lost, for we must be back again before the cock crows,” said the plain looking man. “An't I making all the haste I can?” answered a shrill, squeaking, querulous voice. “The Game-Chicken is half full of water, and I am baling it out with my hat.” “Do you think she will carry us safely over?” “What—the Game-Chicken? Why, darn my eyes, sir, if I don't believe she'd swim with all the water of the sea on board. If a man is ever drowned in her, it will be because he was'nt born to be hanged, I reckon. There, now, I'm ready.” “Step in, Mr. Anderson,” said the plain gentleman, politely. “Mr. Anderson! Sir, my name is—” “Anderson, sir,” interrupted the other, quickly. “You forget,” added he, in a low voice. “Yes, too true; there is no help for it, now,” said the other, in the same low tone. “Why was I not returned back to the ship as was promised?” “Because she has changed her position during the night. See, she is just visible in the moonlight; it would be broad day before I could return, and how should I be able to account for being there at all?” “Why, then, return? Remain on board, and accompany me to New York, where, I pledge my honour, you shall be amply rewarded.” “I thank you, major—Mr. Anderson, I should say, but I leave too great a stake behind—my family and my property.” “Take your family with you, or send for them; they will not be detained, and as for your property amends may easily be made for its loss.” “No, faith! My wife and children shall never become exiles for me. I must return, before it is known I have been away, except by this half-witted sailor.” “Aye,” replied the blue surtout, bitterly, “and play the traitor to both sides, like some of your betters at West Point.” “Traitor and spy are boon companions all the world over,” replied the other carelessly. “But come, sir, the boat waits; and hark! the first cock crows. It will be late before you reach Croton river. Once over that, and you may whistle your way to New York in safety.” The party now entered the Game-Chicken, as Arthur called his boat, and being pushed from the beach, the pilot began to ply his pair of oars briskly, ever and anon chaunting a stave of the following ditty, which tradition has still preserved among some of the old sky-larkers of the revolution, who were then boys living between the lines— “Yankee Doodle, he's half horse, And tother, alligator, He'll squash the red coats in his jaws, Jist like a rotten tater.” “Oh! for mercy's sake, Arthur, stop that ditty. It sets my teeth on edge. Your voice is second only to a screech-owl,” said the plain gentleman. “Screech-owl, sir! Why, when I was aboard the Bone Ham Richard, I was counted the best singer of the whole mess. Besides, my oars won't keep time together unless I set them to music— VOL. II. 11 “Yankee Doodle, he's the boy, The tories can't abide him, He makes them run from Perth Amboy, And the red coats close aside 'em. “The red coats don't come here to fight, They're all a pack of thieves, sir, They rob our hen-roosts every night, And not a pullet leaves, sir.” At the end of each alternate line of the preceding stanzas, Arthur signalized the word, sir, by jerking his oars with sudden emphasis, and throwing himself back, making the Game-Chicken spin through the water merrily. “But we'll be quits with them full soon, Though they are all so frumptious, We'll lick them tother side the moon, For all they're so contumptious.” “Stop that infernal stave, I tell you, Arthur, major— Mr. Anderson wishes to take a nap, and can't sleep with such a squeaking in his ears. Besides, he don't like to hear the red coats run down,” again interrupted the plain gentleman. “No? why, that's strange! If Squire Anderson is a good whig, as I conclude he is, or I'll be darned if he should ever have set his foot aboard the Game-Chicken, he'll like my song above all things— “I heard a little bird to-day A singing chip, chip, chip, The Yankees will the red coats pay And all their bullies whip, whip. “Huzza! for Washington and Greene, Likewise Bloody Anthony, Such glorious boys were never seen To fight for liberty. “Then here's to all Americans Among the bold and free, That fill their cups and toss their cans Where I should like to be. “Huzza! again for—” Here the song was brought to an abrupt close, by the Game-Chicken suddenly striking the shore, with a shock that pitched Arthur backwards into the bottom of the boat, with his heels uppermost. “There's a hole in the ballad, Arthur,” said the plain gentleman. “N—ye—es,” drawled out Arthur, feeling as if for something behind him, “and somewhere else, too, I reckon. I didn't calculate we were half over the bay, but somehow or other, the Game-Chicken sails like the wind to the tune of Yankee Doodle.” The two passengers now jumped on shore, leaving the pea-jacket in charge of the Game-Chicken, and ascended the bank, where they found a horse held by a servant of the plain gentleman, who directed him to go down to the boat and there wait his coming. “Now, sir,” said he, addressing the person in the blue surtout, “mount, and spur for life. Until you have passed Croton river, you are in danger every moment. Once on the other side, and you will be comparatively safe, in your present disguise, and with a pass in your pocket. But your life depends on escaping detection.” “My life? I can at the worst be considered and treated as a prisoner of war, and my life will be in no danger, at least after I am taken.” “Don't believe it, sir. You have been within the rebel lines. You are travelling in disguise, and carry about you what will assuredly hang you should you be taken to the head-quarters of General Washington.” “General Washington,” echoed the other, contemptuously, “who made him a general? But I care not; they can only consider me a prisoner of war, and treat me as such. I should soon be exchanged.” “Never, sir. You don't know this Mr. Washington, as you call him. A court-martial will be convened, if you are taken with the papers upon you, and you will be hanged as sure as you are alive.” “Hang me! the adjutant! the— He dare not do it.” “I tell you again, you don't know him. He will dare anything authorized by the laws of war, for the good of his cause and his country. I wish well to neither, at least according to his creed; but this I will say of him, that he is as firm as a rock when he believes himself right, and in this case he will have right on his side.” “Right? I am no spy, sir.” “Mr. Anderson,” said the other, firmly, “let me ask you one simple question—did you, or did you not know the business on which you were sent?” “Was I a fool to be sent blindfold on an errand? I did—what then?” “Then, sir, I must be bold to tell you, frankly, you come as a spy—you performed the functions of a spy, and will be treated accordingly if you fall into the hands of the rebels in this disguise.” “And who obliged me to disgrace myself thus? I came in my uniform as a British officer, known and recognised as such, and was thus received. That I came within the enemy's lines was not my fault; that the Vulture, in which I came, dropped down the river to escape the fire of the rebels, was no business of mine—and that I wear a disguise arises from necessity, not choice. I a spy! I suffer the disgraceful death of a felon! Pooh, sir! you are conjuring up bugbears to frighten me.” “Well—well—we will not dispute the point any more. Too much time has been wasted already. Farewell, and make all the speed you can, for again I tell you, your life is involved in this perilous adventure.” The conference ended here. The man in the blue surtout turned his horse's head towards the south, the other hastily returned to the boat, which immediately pushed off for the opposite shore. The former pursued his way briskly, and notwithstanding his previous declarations, reflected keenly and deeply on the predicament in which he was placed—partly by his own acts, partly by the agency of others. Though possessed of a pass from the commandant at West Point, which would, in all probability, insure his release should he be stopped on his way, still there was something in the business he was upon, and the disguise he had assumed, which not even the fanaticism of loyalty by which he was actuated, could thoroughly reconcile to the feelings of a man of honour, or the frank and manly 11* spirit of a gallant soldier. The sun had risen before he arrived at Croton river, at a point where there was no bridge at that time, and which was crossed by a ferry, kept, as before stated, by Farmer Underwood. It was fordable at low water, but at this time the tide was high, and a boat was necessary to pass over travellers. The farmer was busy at his morning avocations, while his three lusty boys were as usual going through their manual in the barn; Obadiah, with a rusty old gun, acting as fugleman, while ever and anon the robustious youth chaunted a stave of some old continental song, redolent of more patriotism than poetry, greatly to the annoyance of the non-combatant farmer. “Why, sure, it can't be possible, Ruth,” said he to his wife; “the boy is singing profane and warlike songs, like unto a thunderbolt. And behold! why, son Obadiah,” cried the old man, raising his voice, “what art thee going to do with that carnal weapon?” “Father,” replied the young man, approaching him, “I hear our people are well nigh starving up yonder in the Highlands. I do wish thee would send us there with a load of flour, instead of down to Kingsbridge.” “Yea, friend Obadiah, and get paid in continental money, instead of golden guineas. Thee talks like a foolish lad, friend Obadiah, of a truth, verily; go to.” “I'll tell thee what, father, I heard such stories of the Yagers, the red coats, the tories, and the Skinners burning down houses and barns, and robbing and abusing the women and children, whose fathers and brothers are gone to the wars, that the spirit moves me to tell thee I am going to join the continental army, as sure as this gun.” “And so am I, father,” said Nehemiah, coming up. “And so am I, father,” said Uriah, following. “And so am I, father! the dev—I mean thee cannot be in earnest, boys.” “Right up and down earnest, father,” replied Obadiah. “We've got our guns ready, and mother has baked us a knapsack full of gingerbread. We're off this morning like a shot. Mother says every young man that can shoulder a musket, ought to fight for his country in times like these—shoulder, hoo!” “Why, the rebellious housewife! this cometh of having Presbyterian blood in her. Thee cannot say thy mother incited thee.” “Yea, father—she told us how Nathaniel Greene, who is now fighting for his country by the side of Washington, and smiting the red coats hip and thigh, belonged to our persuasion. She said it was a sin and a shame that her sons should be carrying corn to the enemy, instead of driving him before them; so we are going to try our hands a little. Present arms!” “A plague on Ruth, my wife, for putting such notions in thy foolish pate; thee will be read out of meeting, boys.” “Never mind, father, when the wars are over, and we are all free and independent, thee shall read us in again, with friend Nathaniel Greene. Take aim—fire! bang!” Ruth now entered, to say breakfast was ready, and was retiring, when Farmer Underwood detained her. “Friend Ruth,” said he, “abide thee a little. Thee has been putting wicked notions into the heads of these foolish boys, and spiriting them on to mischief; even now they depart to join in the unlawful business of defending their country. Thee art but half a Quaker, Ruth. What evil spirit possessed thee?” “No evil spirit, friend,” replied Ruth, with a mild and simple fervour. “No evil spirit, friend Nathan; but almost every day, for more than a year past, I have seen the smoke of our neighbours' buildings rising over yonder hill, and I knew who it was that set them on fire. I have heard story after story of farms laid waste, cattle driven away, old men and women abused, even unto death, and young maidens insulted and outraged by the lawless soldiers from beyond the seas. And when I saw and heard all this, I said to myself, in the bitterness of my heart, am I the mother of women, that my sons should be idle at home, while their country is bleeding? Nathan, thou art a Friend, but thou art still a man. Thou hast sons with stout hearts and willing minds; wouldst thou see thy country—that generous country which opened its bosom to thy fathers, in times when no other refuge was left them on the face of the earth, ravaged and subdued by the descendants of our ancient persecutors—trodden under foot, crushed to the earth in cruel bondage, by those who, at the same time, if they should triumph, will persecute our faith as they did in past days, and make us again exiles or martyrs? Couldst thou see this, oh Nathan! and not lend a hand in such woful times of need?—couldst thou, friend Nathan?” “No—d—n me if I could. Ruth, the boys shall go, and we will both bless them at parting. The spirit of truth has spoken from thy lips. They shall gird on their armour, and if they don't fight bravely, they are no blood of mine or thine. Zounds and fury, Ruth! the spirit moveth me sorely to go forth myself, like David against Goliath, and smite the Philistines.” “Nay, friend Nathan, thou shalt stay at home, and take care of me and thy mill, while thou prayest for the safety of our children and our country. But behold! some one is riding down yonder hill; he seems a stranger, and in haste.” As they turned their eyes in that direction, a horseman was seen descending with rapid pace into the valley of the Croton, whereupon, Obadiah marched out into the middle of the road, with musket on his shoulder, and awaited his coming in grim array. “Stay a little, friend,” said Obadiah, as he came up. “Where art thou riding so fast?” “What's that to you, friend? suppose I am in haste, that is no affair of thine.” “Yea, verily, but it is, friend. Thee may be a spy, for what I know, and a spy is a serpent in the grass, I have heard say.” “Spy! why, what do you know? Have you heard?” Here the traveller checked himself, and the thought came over his mind, that his cause or his errand could not be good, when every clodhopper thus threw him off his guard and alarmed him into betraying himself. Recovering, in some measure, his self-possession, he produced his pass, and asked if that was not sufficient. Obadiah examined it with the air of an old campaigner, and answered— “Verily, it seemeth so. Thee may go thy way, friend.” “Heaven be praised!” again thought the traveller; “but what a scoundrel do I seem to be, thus swindling my way at the risk of every moment being discovered and disgraced.” Then once more addressing Obadiah, he asked— “How far do you call it to Kingsbridge, friend?” “What, thee is going to Kingsbridge, then, friend?” “I expected an answer, not a question, friend.” “Yea, verily—hem—it seemeth to me, friend, that I should like to know what business thee has at Kingsbridge?” “And it seemeth to me, friend, that I shall not tell thee, for, as I said before, it is no business of thine.” “Well, friend, I don't wish to pry into thy secrets. It is somewhere about four-and-twenty miles to Kingsbridge.” “Could I get breakfast on the road, some three or four miles onward?” “Much nearer, friend,” said Obadiah, “we are just going to fall to, ourselves, and albeit thee won't answer a civil question, I can promise thee a welcome.” “Thank you—thank you, friend, a thousand times; but I am in great haste, and must be riding a few miles onward before I stop. I would not miss being in New York this night for ten thousand guineas. Is the boat ready?” Being answered in the affirmative, he entered the boat, and in a few minutes was landed on the other side. “I wonder who he can be. I think I have seen him somewhere before. Verily, now I recollect, Ruth, I believe it was the last time I went to New York—to— to—hem!” and here, friend Nathan stopped short, apparently in some little confusion. “I wish I had stopped him,” quoth Obadiah, “for all his pass. He talked about ten thousand guineas, and that's an idear that would never come across a continental; they talk about nothing but continental money. But now it's too late, for we must be going. Nehemiah, Uriah, march!” cried he, in a loud voice, which was answered by the appearance of the two brothers. “The blessing of a good conscience and a good cause be upon thee, my sons. Take care to come back safe and sound,” said the father. “God in his goodness bless thee, my sons,” said Ruth. “Go to the good Washington, and tell him, a mother hath sent the sons of her bosom to fight by his side. Take care of thy country, and be sure not to come home with a wound in thy backs.” The lads departed on their holy errand, from which one of them never returned. The stout-hearted Obadiah fell at the head of his company, storming the works at Yorktown, and the others returned at the end of the war, with an honourable rank, and honourable scars to show that it had been dearly earned. When they disappeared behind the hill, Ruth applied her snow-white apron to her eyes, and then sat down to her household cares. It is recorded, however, as a curious fact, that she never before found such difficulty in threading her needle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. A LOST TRAVELLER—HAGAR IN THE WILDERNESS—FOLLY LEADING REASON—A GLANCE AT OUR HERO, HIS THOUGHTS, OCCUPATIONS, AND COMPANIONS—HAGAR'S MISSION, SHOWING THAT PROVIDENCE SOMETIMES MAKES USE OF STRANGE INSTRUMENTS TO BRING ABOUT EVENTS ON WHICH GREAT CONSEQUENCES DEPEND. The traveller pursued his way so absorbed in his own reflections, as to leave his horse for a time to the direction of his own instinct, which is not always a safe guide to reason. It pleased instinct to turn to the left, instead of the right, simply because that was more in a direction towards the accustomed home of the animal. The traveller, after a ride of some mile or two, at length came to a deep, sequestered dell, encompassed on three sides by steep ledges of rocks, through which coursed a noisy stream, rendered gloomy by a thick growth of pine and hemlock nodding over the summit of the rugged precipice. It struck him that this could not be the highroad leading to a great city, and perceiving a log-cabin from whence rose a column of smoke, he rode up and knocked at the door with the butt-end of his whip with the intention of inquiring his way. The signal was answered by the appearance of a woman somewhat past her prime, and dressed in the wretched rags of beggary, who saluted him with the following brief interrogatory— “Well, what's your will, good man?” “I wish to know where I am, good woman.” It is difficult to tell why, but certain it is that the phrase, good woman, however complimentary it may seem, is not generally agreeable to the gentler sex, and accordingly the occupant of the log-cabin replied rather tartly— “You wish to know where you are? Why, good man, in your skin, I should guess.” “I mean, I have lost my way, good woman.” “No, sure? Why, where did you come from?” “What matters it to you? I tell you I have lost my way.” “Well, I tell you, I have not found it. But if you won't tell me where you came from, maybe you will tell where you are going to, and then I may tell you the right way.” “I want to find the post-road,” said the traveller, evasively. “The post-road! why, Lord love you, sir, where could you come from to get out of the post-road into such an out-of-the-way place as this? I havn't seen a stranger here since the beginning of the war.” “Suppose I have not been on the post-road, yet?” “No? why, a'nt you come down from the army at West Point? You look for all the world like an officer in disguise.” “Disguise! well, suppose I have, what then?” “Oh! then you saw General Washington, he that VOL. II. 12 beats the red coats so handsomely,” rejoined Hagar Raven, as she was called, eyeing him keenly. “He beat the red coats—pshaw!” here he checked himself, adding, “No, I never saw the face of Mr. Washington, though I have often seen his back.” “Never saw him! why, I declare I'd go ten, aye, twenty miles on foot to see him, any day,” and the woman kept her eye steadily on him. “So would I, to see him—hum—but, good woman, my time is precious. Do you mean to direct me, or not?” “What will you give me, sir? It's a long way, and now I think of it, there is a party of continentals up at Pine's bridge. Maybe, you'd like to fall in with them?” “Continental soldiers! No, no,” added he hastily, in a careless tone. “No, I have nothing particular to say to them, and am in great haste, as I told you. Show me some other way, and I'll give you a dollar.” “I want none of your continental money, good man.” “It shall be a silver dollar.” “What, a real silver dollar? Goody gracious, will you? I'll show you the way all the country over for that. Will it be a real Spanish dollar?” “Yes, yes—lead on, good woman; but mind you keep clear of the continentals.” “Never fear, sir.” If that a'nt a British officer, thought Hagar, my name is not Raven. “Let me put on my hat and cloak, and make myself decent.” “O, never mind your hat and cloak,” said the traveller, impatiently. Vanity and beggary are a pretty pair! The woman seems half mad or half idiot, was the thought of our traveller, while Hagar went into the cabin, whence she speedily returned, saying, “Now, sir, I'm fit to be seen like—don't you think I'm rather pretty?” “Very—a perfect beauty.” “Won't you take me up behind you, sir?” “My horse won't carry double.” Faith, thought he, I should cut a figure with this angel behind me. “Well, then, I suppose I must walk; but never mind, I can sing away the time. Do you like singing, sir?” “Oh, anything, anything; only get on as fast as you can.” “I'm ready, sir;” and Hagar commenced a stave, as follows, as she led the way with long, masculine steps: “Come follow, follow me, and you shall see, As the old man said to his old blind wife, Come follow, follow me, and then you shall see What an old blind woman never saw in her life.” “What do you think that was, sir?” “I don't know, and I don't care; zounds, why don't you push on, woman?” “'Twas a bumble-bee, with his tail cut off. He! he! now for it, here we go.” Saying this, she increased her pace, followed by our traveller, who could not help thinking himself in a promising way, with a half-crazy or half-idiot witch for his guide. But there was no help for it now. Not another house was in sight, and shrugging his shoulders, he consoled himself with the idea, that as the blind often lead the blind, some good might come of a crack-brained guide. But Hagar was not quite as great a fool as she affected to be. Though somewhat fantastical by nature, she was still more cunning, and partly affected folly, the better to impose upon the vanity of wisdom. Her occupation was begging, than which nothing requires a more practical insight into the workings of the human heart. She knew, from experience, that thousands who would refuse her charity as a rational being, might be cheated into pitying one divested of reason. She was known through all the surrounding country, over which she roamed at pleasure; and had, by long prescription, acquired a sort of right to be relieved, or entertained wherever she went. No one ever thought of harming her, although there was sometimes a shrewd malignity in her tongue, which scarcely would have been endured from one of higher pretensions to rationality; and thus, without labour or economy, without kindred or friends, she lived in that mysterious, inscrutable way, which so often puzzles those who can scarcely procure the same comforts by perpetual labour, and unceasing economy. Among her other peculiarities, Hagar was a staunch whig, and had often, by the freedom she enjoyed under the veil of folly, and the strange intuitive cunning she possessed, obtained information of special moment to the cause she so zealously espoused. With this hopeful guide our traveller pursued his way, unwinding the labyrinth into which he had involved himself by his absence of mind, and which eventually led to consequences so momentous to himself and to millions of his fellow-creatures. Sometimes he urged her forward by complaints, at others by promises, while occasionally he would lag behind, to escape her ceaseless prattle, and unconnected, unintelligible scraps of songs. At such times, Hagar would parody his words and manner, exclaiming, with affected impatience, “Come, good man, zounds! why don't you push on? Who makes you wait now, I wonder?” After what seemed to him an endless succession of windings and turnings, they at length struck the post-road, a mile or two from where the traveller had deviated from it, and Hagar now demanded the reward, which was promptly paid. As he drew out his purse, the woman, who kept her eye fixed upon him so keenly that it created a disagreeable sensation, observed that it contained gold, and this circumstance increased the suspicions she had previously entertained. She well knew that the poor champions of freedom carried no such commodity, for she had often of late seen them exchanging a handful of rags for a meal. Here, they parted; the traveller taking his way towards the south to meet his fate, while Hagar stood watching his course, and brooding over a plan which will be developed in the sequel. At parting, they only exchanged these few brief words— “Good-bye, sir; you are such a likely gentleman, that I should wish to cultivate your acquaintance. I hope we shall meet again.” “Heaven forbid!” exclaimed the traveller, as he spurred his steed and was soon out of sight. While these events were passing, our hero had principally devoted himself to rural occupations, and watching over the feeble old couple at the stone house, whose passage he endeavoured to smooth, by 12* every effort of duty and affection in his power, to the long home of all the race of man. The sacrifice was painful, for his spirit longed to be once more labouring in the cause dear to his heart, for an object, if possible, still dearer. But in the conflict of opposing duties and wishes, he chose the right path; since the aid he might give to his country was but as a drop in the bucket, while his presence at home and his daily labours, were indispensable to the comfort, nay, the very existence of those, whom all the obligations of nature and gratitude called on him to protect and cherish in their old age. He neither sought Colonel Hammond, nor did the colonel seek him. He kept aloof from Jane, who never forgot the decent maidenly pride of women by placing herself in a situation to be sought or avoided. True, she had long since forgiven the recreant; nay, reflection and good sense combined, had, after the first impulse of wounded pride and affection, served only to raise him still higher in her estimation, and root him more deeply in her heart. The old continental, too, when his indignation had cooled down, instead of blaming John, thanked him in his heart for not taking advantage of a burst of generosity, which upon reflection, he thought unworthy a man of his experience. The colonel was one of millions of human bipeds, who feel under peculiar obligations to their friends for not availing themselves of every sudden impulse of gratitude or liberality, such as frequently flashes forth with great brilliancy, but goes out like a sky-rocket without warming anybody. He would have made up matters with John, had not his daughter, who, the reader may remember, hated proud people so much, wrested from him a solemn promise not to interfere, and most especially to avoid making any advances during the present crisis of affairs. Our hero's only consolation was in feasting on the consciousness of having acted with honour, and in watching the smoke as it curled gracefully from the white chimneys of the house of his ladye love. Occasionally, however, he made one of a party of young men, just verging towards manhood, and residing in the vicinity, to scour the country towards Kingsbridge, with the purpose of gaining information, picking up stragglers, or intercepting plunderers. On these occasions, they always acted under the sanction or authority of the nearest commanding officer of a post, and their usual rendezvous was at the house described in the outset of this history, at the entrance of Hardscrabble Hole. The party consisted of three only, Isaac, David, and John, who, not contemplating a sortie until night, had only met to arrange their plans, without bringing their arms with them. David, who was a gay, careless lad, had been singing part of a stave of an old song, when a dialogue ensued something to the following purport. “Come—come, David, no more music now. It is high time to go home and make our preparations.” “I'll not stir a peg till I've finished my song,” replied David, who began another stave, which was interrupted by a voice from without, humming— “Fe, faw, fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman— Fe, faw, fum.” “It's that half fool, half witch, half woman, and half d—l, Hagar!” exclaimed David, as he ran to the window and inquired whence she came. “From the place where you are going, friend,” said she. “Where's that, beauty?” “The gallows, friend. You'd make a pretty hanging bird, singing the tune the old cow died of.” “Hah! hah! she's too sharp for you, David!” exclaimed Isaac. “As sharp as Mrs. Boshin's cider. But do tell me, what brought you here, beauty?” “I'll not talk to such a goose as you,” replied Hagar, at the same time beckoning John out, where they soon became engaged in deep discussion. “I suppose,” said David to the other, “she is telling his fortune. I wonder what she'll make of him, a justice of the peace, or a schoolmaster?” “Oh! a schoolmaster, by all means. You know he is a great scholar, and talks horse Latin.” “A blue surtout?” said our hero to Hagar. “Yes, but I'll swear it was never made for him. You know I was once a tailor's wife, and understand a fit. I saw him housed at Sing Sing, where he will get his breakfast. There is not a moment to be lost, if you wish to intercept him. I am certain he is disguised, and employed in some mischief.” After reflecting a few moments, John spoke a few words in a low voice to Hagar, who hastily departed, while the three young men strode away to procure their arms for a purpose, of which our hero promised to apprise them on the way. What this was, will doubtless be easily anticipated by the judicious reader, from whose intuitive sagacity it is now next to impossible for the most mystifying varlet of an author to keep a single secret, either as to the progress or catastrophe of his story. And hence it is, beyond all doubt, that divers ingenious writers of romantic fiction, do wilfully entangle their web of adventures in such inextricable mystery and confusion, that the gentle reader is left pretty much in the predicament of a hound who has lost the scent, and travels round and round, in an endless circle of perplexity, until, peradventure, his breath fails him, and he sinks down in a state of utter exhaustion. Nor is the writer so much to blame for using all his art, as it were, to dodge his readers and put them on the wrong track, seeing that nothing but characters acting altogether out of character, causes without effects, and effects without causes, reinforced by striking incidents, producing results diametrically opposite to their natural consequences, can possibly achieve that incomprehensible medley, that sublime obscurity, which utterly confounds the understanding, baffles the sagacity of the most experienced reader of romance, and from which the denouement at length comes forth, like a cat from a strange garret, only to create a more agreeable surprise from being so entirely unexpected and out of place. But to return from this digression, which we present as a general apology for the cruel mystifications which writers of romance are in their self-defence compelled to inflict on their readers. Previous to their departing to furnish themselves with arms, John communicated the information he had received from Hagar, and his conviction that some mystery was connected with the journey of the stranger. The principal danger was, that he might get beyond their reach, before they could procure their arms, and gain a proper position to intercept him; and to delay him as long as possible, Hagar had undertaken to meet him on the bridge, near the church, solicit his charity, and arrest his progress by practising all the mummeries of her calling. They then parted, after appointing a meeting at Clark's Kill bridge, which spanned a small stream crossing the road, at a point bordered by a wood, which presented a favourable spot for concealment. In the lapse of little more than half a century, the wood has disappeared, the stream dwindled into a little rivulet, almost dry in summer; and the majestic tulip-tree, which constituted by far the most remarkable object in the immediate vicinity, has disappeared, leaving not a vestige behind. It was several years ago shivered by lightning from top to bottom, fell to the ground, and the precise spot where it stood, can no longer be ascertained.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. A BREAKFAST SCENE—A LEFT-HANDED PANEGYRIC ON WAR— A LAND SCRAPE—A COUNTRY CHURCH—A RARE FORTUNETELLER, WHOSE PREDICTIONS ARE EVENTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED—THE TRAVELLER INTERCEPTED—OFFERS AND REFUSALS, SHOWING THAT POVERTY IS NOT QUITE SO GREAT A ROGUE AS SOME PEOPLE THINK. At parting with his eccentric guide, our traveller pursued his way briskly, until he came to a little town, pleasantly situated, where he halted to refresh himself and horse at a small inn by the roadside. He was weary, and his mind but ill at ease, for he could not hide from himself that his situation was equivocal, and felt as every honourable man must feel when imposing on the world in an assumed character. As he sat musing in this unpleasant state of mind, a young girl, of rather interesting appearance, and modest manner, was passing in and out the room, preparing his meal, of whom, at length, rather from idleness, than any interest in the question, he inquired the name of the village. “Sing Sing, sir,” she replied. “It must be a very musical place. I suppose you do nothing but sing all day long.” “No, indeed, sir—we have no heart to sing; even the birds have left off singing, I believe.” “Aye, indeed; and what may be the reason?” “Our fathers and brothers are gone to the wars, or to their graves; the fields have grown up into weeds, for there is no one to cultivate them, and if there were, they would be plundered before harvest time. I have heard say the beggar may sing before the robber, but believe he seldom has the heart to sing.” “And your sweethearts—they too are gone to the wars, I suppose.” “We don't think of such things now, sir.” “No—what do you think of, then?” “Of insult, poverty, and starvation.” “Suppose you take me for a sweetheart,” said he, smiling. “Your breakfast is ready, sir.” “Nay, I must have a kiss—one kiss!” and he advanced towards her, placing his arm around her waist. “Oh, my poor mother!” exclaimed she, bursting into tears. “Never mind your mother, she don't see you now.” “Yes she does, and my father too.” “Indeed—where are they?” “In heaven, I trust, sir.” “What! an orphan?” exclaimed he, quickly disengaging his arm. “Forgive me, my poor girl. How long have you been here? you look as if you were not born for this place.” “No, sir—necessity forced me to it.” “As how, poor girl?” “Do you see that black chimney, yonder, over the fields?” “What, close by the willow tree?” “That was my home, sir; but they came one dark night, about two months ago, and burnt it down, because they said we were d—d rebels, and my brothers were serving in the continental army.” “Who burnt it down?” “The red coats, sir.” “The red devils reward them, I say; but go on, and tell me all.” “In that house lived my father and mother.” “And they murdered them?” “No, sir, not with their swords. They set fire to the house, in the dead of night, and then rode away, huzzaing for King George. My father was old, and confined with rheumatism; my mother sick with ague and fever, and—so they were burnt to death. I was young, and escaped, though I could not help them; and having no other home, I came here to earn my bread, and be insulted by whoever pleases.” “Forgive me—I entreat you to forgive me; I was but in sport.” “It may be sport to you, sir, but it is death to me.” Saying this, she left the room. “Bad—bad—bad,” said the traveller, shaking his head. “I shall see to this when I get to New York. The rebels can neither be conciliated or conquered by such treatment.” “Sir,” said the little girl, who had returned to wait on him. “I—I—mean, can I do anything for you. Will money be of any service to you, my poor girl?” and he took her kindly by the hand. “No, sir. But you look as if you might belong to VOL. II. 13 the army. I have two brothers there, named George and Thomas Raymond. If you should chance to see them, tell them you saw me, and that I am well; but don't tell them what I have been telling you, for if they knew, they would butcher every red coat that fell into their hands. There is blood enough shed in battle, and though I own I cannot forgive their cruelty, I sometimes pray God to forgive them.” “What a wreath to deck the annals of glory!” thought the traveller, as he sat down to breakfast. “Surely fate can be little else than a chance medley. She fires at random, careless where she hits, or whose heart she pierces. What had this poor girl done, that she should be left fatherless, motherless, homeless, to wait at a tavern on me; me, who at this moment am about to aim a death-blow at the heart of her country? It might humble the pride of the hero, did he know that, after all his exertions, he is but warring against decrepid age, helpless women, and innocent babes. It is they that bear the brunt of bloody war, and pay the price of glory.” On his departure, he continued for some time occupied by a train of reflections, arising out of the tale to which he had been listening, until arriving at the summit of a hill, a scene broke upon his view so magnificently beautiful, that it at one and the same moment, arrested his progress and his thoughts. Towards the north, he saw the distant Highlands, rising in a long line of blue waving curves, tracing the skies from east to west, and passing away in gradually softened tints, till they melted and mingled with the clouds. To the south, a fair expanse of variegated fields, meadows, and woods, gay with the first tints of autumn, spread far and wide; while towards the west, a long line of bold hills skirted the noble river, and ended at last in those majestic cliffs, projecting out at intervals, one beyond the other, like massive battlements and towers, not the fabled work of the giants or Cyclops, but of the sublime Architect of the universe. The soul of our traveller was full of poetry. He loved nature in her beautiful attire, and his feelings promptly associated themselves with the prospect around him. From thence, by a natural transition, his recollections wandered towards his native land, the scenes of his early days, and the wonted inmates of his heart, whom a distance of three thousand miles, and an intervening ocean, only rendered nearer and dearer. Murmuring a name dearer than all the rest besides, he spurred his horse, and descended into a solitary woodland glen, which, though not houseless, seemed quite deserted. Anon he came in sight of the steeple of a rustic stone church, peeping its taper point above a grove of ancient locust-trees, where the road making a sudden turn to the left, led into a narrow pass, shaded with trees, and coursed by a large brook, over which a bridge appeared at intervals as he proceeded, on which he was somewhat startled to perceive some one standing, as if awaiting his arrival. Coming up to the bridge, he at once recognised his former crack-brained guide, posted as if resolved to arrest his course, and the rencontre was so peculiarly unwelcome, in his present frame of mind, that he addressed Hagar rather unceremoniously, with “What do you want? and what are you doing here?” “Oh, consider, cow, consider!” replied Hagar, adopting the whining cant of beggary. “Consider, cow, consider, as the song says; shall I sing it for you, sir? Consider I'm a poor, lonesome woman, with a family of thirteen children, one for every state, you know; and a husband that can't lift his hand to his head, for the rheumatiz. For charity's sake give me a guinea, won't you, honey dear? Do, now, and I'll sing you one of my best songs.” “A guinea? why, it is only a few hours ago that I gave you a dollar.” “Aye, sir, but you can't say you gave it me, for I earned it honestly by showing you the right road. But whether or no, it is all gone, and spent, and I've no larning to make up for its loss. I bought a paper of pins, and two jew's-harps, of an old tinkering pedlar, for my little pickaninnies to larn music.” “Poor idiot!” exclaimed the traveller. “Have you no friends, that you are wandering about between the lines, in these dangerous times?” “Oh, sir, I am not afraid of any body but the ghosts, and the red coats, that are so fond of pretty women. The Yagers would skin a flint, but they can get nothing from poor me; and as for the tories, I always scratch out their eyes whenever I meet them. Now do, honey dear, bless your heart—I know by your handsome face you must be tender-hearted; now do give a guinea to a poor soul that lives in a hollow tree, and tells fortunes.” “Will you tell mine?” “What will you give me, sir?” “That depends on what you give me. If you promise me the command of his Majesty's forces in New York, perhaps I may give you a guinea.” “What! then you are a red coat? Well, I do declare, I dreamt so the night after to-morrow. Hah! hah! hah! how strange it is that my dreams always come true. Isn't it, honey dear?” “Pshaw! let me pass, good woman?” “Not till I've told your fortune, and earned my guinea. Come, honey—hold out your hand, that's the book of fate.” Here she snatched his hand, before he was aware, and looking him full in the face, with a deal of precious mummery, began her prognostics. “Ah! what do I see here? Here is G, stands for gallows; here is S, stands for spy—and here is a twisted rope, that stands for hanging; and here—you'll not live long, my friend, you'll not live long.” And she shook her head with awful solemnity. “Out of my way, you hag, and let me pass, or I'll ride over you!” “Well, I declare, the more I look at you, the more faith I have in my dream. You've got the most hanging look, honey dear, of any one I almost ever saw. The gallows will be your end, so sure as your life had a beginning. You'll dance upon nothing, without a fiddle, while I stand by and sing hey diddle, diddle.” Here she practised divers grotesque evolutions, taking care to keep always directly before the horse. “My guinea, sweet sir, my golden guinea.” “Alas! poor crazy idiot! what a fool was I to suppose she meant anything by her predictions. Here is something, though not a guinea. Now let me pass, my time is precious.” The traveller took out his purse, and again it disclosed its golden store. 13* “Ha! ha! he! he!” and Hagar laughed like a sheer idiot. “La! what beautiful shiners! The Yankee officers have no such pretty pictures as these. I swear, you shan't stir from this spot, till you give me a guinea. I'll keep it for a love token, to put me in mind of you after you come to the gallows, as you certainly will do, soon. Come, honey dear—you won't want your money long.” “What are you about? let go my bridle!” “A guinea, sweet sir—a golden guinea!” “Let go, I say; or by heaven, I'll gallop over your body!” A struggle now ensued. The traveller spurred his horse, and Hagar clung to the bridle, at the risk of being crushed under the feet of the startled animal, who reared and plunged furiously. At this moment, the report of a gun was distinctly heard. Hagar relinquished the bridle, and the rider dashing forward, disappeared in an instant. “I've told his fortune,” said she, chuckling, and pursuing her course in another direction. The traveller rode on, perplexed not a little at the behaviour of the crack-brained guide, which he was at a loss whether to ascribe to folly, madness, or cunning. Had he been inclined to superstition, this second prediction would have startled him, for he remembered that, just previous to his leaving home, for the new world, he had accompanied a party of gay young people to a famous fortune-teller, and that on inspecting his hand, the sybil had announced, that he was going to a distant country, beyond the sea, where it would be his fortune to be hanged.[3] [3] A fact related by himself afterwards. “We all laughed heartily,” thought he, “but who knows? stranger things have happened in this topsy-turvy world. It is, however, quite impossible I should be known to this shedevil, that thus besets me. There is no harm, however, in a little more speed.” And thus communing with himself, he spurred his horse into a gallop. He had now passed all the American posts; a few miles' ride would bring him to Kingsbridge, and the great object of his mission be accomplished. Congratulating himself on the favourable prospects before him, he proceeded onward with a light heart, until coming to a little rustic bridge, which crossed a brook intersecting the road, the flooring of which, being somewhat loose and decayed, caused him to slacken his pace, his reins were suddenly seized by a man, who darted from the wood at the roadside, and ordered him to stop at his peril. Thrown off his guard, for a moment, by this action, so totally unexpected, the traveller hastily asked, “Are you from above, or below?” two phrases usually employed to designate the American and British armies, one of which was in the Highlands, the other occupying the city of New York. John, for he it was, warily answered, “From below;” at which, the other expressed great satisfaction, declaring himself of the same party, and adding that his business was urgent; that he was exceedingly anxious to get to head-quarters, and that he desired to be permitted to proceed without a moment's delay. “I regret, sir,” said John, “that your business is so urgent, as it is absolutely necessary to detain you a little longer.” “By what authority, sir? and who are you?” “A rebel!” “Let me pass! let go my reins!” exclaimed the traveller, making a violent effort to ride over him.” “Dismount this instant, or I will pull you from your horse! be you whom you may, rebel, or red coat, soldier, or citizen—dismount!” “If I were armed, I would dispute your commands, my friend; but as that is not the case, I must resort to peaceful measures. Can you read? do you know what this means?” He then drew forth a paper, which he handed to John, who, after looking it over, respectfully, yet firmly, addressed him as follows: “This paper, as well as I can judge, sir, is genuine. But not being acquainted with the hand-writing of General Arnold, you must excuse me if I am not quite satisfied. You are here under circumstances to excite great suspicion. You have acknowledged yourself an enemy, and displayed great satisfaction at hearing I belonged to your party, for which there was no occasion, had you been on lawful business, with a pass in your pocket. I must know more, before I let you go. You must accompany me into this wood, and submit to further examination.” “By what authority, sir?” “By the authority which God gives to every man defending his rights and his country.” “Rebellious cant!” muttered the traveller; “but you shall answer for this contempt of General Arnold's pass. Do you know the consequences?” “Not exactly; but be they what they may, for this once, I am willing to incur them. Dismount, sir! or I shall be under the necessity of forcing you, although I wish to avoid it, if possible. There is no use in hesitating; for I must, and will be satisfied.” Perceiving the traveller still hesitated, he quietly led his horse into the wood, where he was still more surprised to find our hero's two companions, with whom it had been previously concerted not to appear, except at a given signal. His impression was, that he had fallen into the hands of one of those lawless bands of marauders, whose exploits between the lines were pretty notorious to both parties. “Gentlemen,” said he, “I am in your power; but I trust you mean no violence to my person.” “Do you take us for robbers, sir?” replied John. “I assure you we are honest men, as times go, and will take nothing from you, but what you have no right to carry.” “Very well; but before you proceed, be good enough to examine that paper once more. I assure you it came from the general's own hands.” “It certainly appears to be a pass from General Arnold, to John Anderson. Is that your name, sir?” said John, eyeing him keenly. “John Anderson is my—I am called by that name,” replied the traveller, with some little hesitation. “On your honour, sir?” “On my honour,” and he coloured deeply. “Excuse me, sir,” observed John, after a little reflection, “for doubting the honour of one who appears to be a gentleman. But as I observed before, you are here under very doubtful circumstances; and your behaviour at the moment I arrested you, was also calculated to excite suspicion. Our country has many secret enemies, and the intentions of the commander-in-chief are frequently known to the enemy, long before they are publicly manifested. I must, and will be satisfied before we part; and for this purpose, I hope you will quietly submit to a search which shall be made with as little offence as possible.” Finding it would be vain to resort to resistance or pursuasion, the traveller submitted, and a search commenced, which ended in the discovery of nothing which threw any light on his character or mission. He then inquired whether it was their pleasure to permit him to proceed on his way, again repeating the expression of his anxiety to reach the city, where he had business of great consequence. “One moment, sir,” replied John, “there is one part of your dress we have neglected. Be good enough to permit us to pull off your boots.” “My boots! surely, gentlemen, you don't mean to insult me?” exclaiming the traveller hastily, and changing colour. “Why insult you more by searching your boots, than any other portion of your dress? Come, sir—I'll be your servant—sit down on this rock. It is useless to resist, for I must and will know why you oppose pulling off your boots, when you made no objection to every other part of your dress being examined.” “May-be the gentleman has got no stockings on; it is not an uncommon thing in these hard times,” quoth David. The traveller seeing it must be so, sat down, and put forth his left leg. “The right, if you please, sir,” said John. “Where is the difference? take this, or none.” “Have done with this trifling, sir,” cried the other, impatiently, and seizing the right boot, drew it off in a twinkling. Then holding up and shaking it, a thin packet of papers fell out, which, on examination, proved to consist of a plan of the works at West Point; the disposition of the American forces; directions for attacking them with advantage, together with a letter from General Arnold, the commander of that most important post, stipulating its delivery on the appearance of the British army under Sir Henry Clinton. The magnitude and importance of this discovery, was fully comprehended by John and his companions; while, during the examination of the papers, the traveller sat apparently reflecting on the best means of escaping from the very serious predicament in which he now felt himself involved. “Well, Mr. Anderson, what say you to this?” said John, after the examination was over. “Thus much, sir. Here is my purse, which is pretty well filled, and here is my watch, which is worth at least fifty guineas. Take these, give me the papers, and let me go. You seem to be poor men by your dress, and it will be a long time before you will earn as much by opposing your lawful sovereign. But I can promise you ten, aye, fifty times as much, if you will accompany me to head-quarters. Name your terms, and I will pledge my honour to the bargain.” “Honour! pray, Mr. Anderson, leave that out. There may be honour among thieves, none among spies and traitors. But let that pass. If you buy us, you must pay well. None of your forty pieces for selling our country to the king, and our souls to perdition.” “What say you to a thousand guineas?” “A good round sum, but not quite enough. In one word, Mr. Anderson, the king cannot buy us. Do not then believe us serious in thus bargaining for the destruction of our country. These papers concerning West Point, now almost the only stronghold of liberty, your extreme anxiety to get to head-quarters at New York, and the high bribe you offer, are all convincing proofs that you are concerned in some treason of great magnitude. Not five, nor ten, nor twenty thousand guineas, could you lay them down here before us, shall buy these papers or release your person. You go with us to be delivered up at the nearest continental post.” “You have only been bantering me, then?” “I wished to estimate the importance of Mr. Anderson,” replied our hero, who was now fully satisfied that was not his name. “Are you all of one mind, gentlemen?” “Exactly,” said David; “we don't mind selling the produce of our land, when the red coats, the tories, and the Skinners leave us any; but we will never sell our country. You must go with us, sir.” “Well, well, take me where you will, but treat me like a gentleman.” “Gentleman!” cried John, warmly; “do you call it the course of a gentleman to wear a disguise, as I know you do? to appear under false colours and a feigned name? to sneak in and out of your enemy's camp under cover of night? to league with traitors in a base conspiracy against a nation's freedom? to become a spy, and then try to escape the consequences by bribing poor but honest men to betray their cause and their country? You shall be treated kindly, though your people have seldom set us the example.” The traveller seemed somewhat surprised, rather than offended, at hearing such language and such sentiments from a plain country lad in homespun clothes, and involuntarily entered on his defence. “What I have done was in the course of my duty, and I stand ready to answer it to my God, my king, and my country. No more schooling, but take me where you will. I am weary with a long journey, will you trust me to ride?” “You might run away from us, who are on foot.” “Shoot me, if I attempt to escape; I pledge my—” “No more of honour, sir. You have deceived us once already. On condition, however, you take your chance of three bullets in case you attempt to escape, you may ride. Come, boys, now for head-quarters.” The traveller mounted his horse, and escorted by the three young lads of Westchester, turned back towards the north, when he had much rather have been “serving his sovereign in the south.” His subsequent fate has become a part of the history of those times, and will not soon be forgotten. He perished on the scaffold, a victim to the stern, but just laws of war; yet his fate may almost be envied, since the very people VOL. II. 14 against whose freedom he was plotting, lamented the necessity of the sacrifice, while his countrymen, in their admiration of his loyalty, forgot that by acting as a spy he forfeited the character of a soldier. It was remarked by one of his most illustrious cotemporaries, “that never man suffered death with more justice, or deserved it less;” and it may be said with equal truth, that had he lived to the utmost age of man, he would in all probability never have acquired by his exploits the fame he has gained by his misfortunes. He has become, as it were, the hero of one of the brightest pages of our history; and the sympathy bestowed on his fate, has, in a great degree, superseded the glory which justly belongs to the three youthful volunteers of Westchester, who discovered the treason of which he was one of the instruments, and spurned the bribes he offered for its concealment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. AN EXAMPLE, SHOWING THAT AS ONE ANIMAL FEEDS ON ANOTHER, SO THE HAPPINESS OF ONE-HALF THE WORLD ARISES FROM THE MISERY OF THE OTHER HALF—THE TINKER VISITS COLONEL HAMMOND, AND TELLS A MUCH BETTER STORY THAN THAT OF THE UNDINE—JANE ONCE MORE VISITS THE OLD STONE HOUSE, WHERE SHE MEETS A STRANGE PERSON, AND RECEIVES AMPLE SATISFACTION FOR A PREVIOUS OFFENCE—A YOUNG COUPLE LOSING THEIR WAY, WHICH THEY FIND IN A CURIOUS MANNER. The good service performed by the three young farmers of Westchester, was received by their country with a burst of grateful applause. They were thanked by Washington in the presence of the army; the glorious Congress of that trying time unanimously passed a vote of thanks, and decreed that a medal should be presented to each one, bearing the honourable motto of “Fidelity.” A pension was also granted them for life, and to these testimonials of national gratitude was added the donation of a fine farm to each from their native state. John, who had necessarily been detained as a witness on the trial of the traveller, whose capture produced such important consequences to himself and his country, was now exceedingly impatient to return home. Besides his anxiety about the good old couple there, he now felt himself authorized to claim the promise of the old continental, and to aspire to his mistress at least on equal terms. The moment he was permitted, he left the army at Tappan, crossed the river, and full of throbbing anticipations, bent his steps towards the old stone house. Leaving him on his road, let us once more turn to the affairs of the colonel and his daughter, whose current of domestic happiness, to say the truth, had not lately ran quite so smoothly as was wont in days of yore. Jane had lost much of her cheerfulness, and her step was not so lightsome. She was given to long fits of melancholy musing, and long, lonesome rambles of evening, along the little river which ran through the domains of her father, who many a time and oft, got out of all his stock of patience, which in truth was not great. He was, in fact, one of those persons, who, instead of sympathising with sorrow or low spirits, prefer to frighten them away by falling into a passion, and railing at their indulgence. “Well, moppet,” said he, as he came up in high good-humour, having caught a fat mole in his trap, for the first time in his life, as is believed; “well—but Thunder and Mars! what are you sitting there for, like a toad in a hole, moping and mewling about nothing? Thinking, I suppose, of that proud, beggarly puppy, John, who, I understand, has been absent for two or three weeks past, nobody knows where. I should not be at all surprised if he had got into the hospital-ship, again.” “Heaven forbid!” replied Jane. “What business has the blockhead to be there, when a soldier can always get killed if he likes? Before they should take me prisoner, I'd be cut into mincemeat. Your old continentals are not to be caught like rabbits without fighting. Thunder and Mars! if I only was the man I used to be, in the old French war, I'd offer my services to drive the red coats out of New York in less than no time.” “But would you leave me, and all your improvements?” asked she, with one of her old-fashioned smiles. “Who thinks of improvement, except in military discipline, when his country is in danger. Thunder and Mars! a soldier's life is the life after all. It is only after hearing the bullets whistle about your ears, and dodging death a hundred times, that a man may be said to enjoy life. One hour of jollification after a victory, is worth all the regular hum-drum, sleepy frolics, in a whole life. Blood and fire! if I was only twenty or thirty years younger!” and the old continental stumped about the room, vociferating— “Why, soldiers, why, Should we be melancholy, boys, Whose bus'ness 'tis to die?” “Ah! Jane, if you had only heard the immortal Wolfe sing that song, it would have made a man of you.” “I am glad to see you in such spirits, sir,” said Jane, with a deep sigh. “I'm glad to see you in such spirits, sir,” echoed the old continental, mimicking her; “Jane, you tell a— fib—you'd be glad to see me snivelling, and sighing, 14* and turning up the whites of my eyes, like a duck in thunder, I know you would. You want me to sympathise with you, as you call it. Confound all sympathy, say I; it only encourages people to make fools of themselves, by being miserable, when they should be forgetting their miseries.” “Father, who is that coming up the road, yonder?” asked Jane, pointing in that direction. “Where? Why, yes, it is that roving, cheating, lying ragamuffin, Mangham, the pedlar, tinker, and Jack of all trades, and both sides to boot.” “Ah! so it is. Perhaps he brings us news of—” and here the young maiden suddenly checked herself. “He bring news! He never put two syllables together, without a lie between them. He is no more to be depended on, than the almanac, or Rivington's Royal Gazette. If he comes in, I insist on your not asking him a single question about that magnanimous puppy, John. Yes!” continued the colonel, rubbing his hands, “yes, there he is, coming through the gate; now—hem—now he will cheat me to a certainty.” The tinker approached, and looking into the window, asked, “May I enter your domicilio, colonel?” “Aye, aye, come in, and take me in; for that follows as a matter of course.” The itinerant trader entered, exhibiting a long, lean, raw-boned, hard-featured figure, with a countenance of mingled roguery and archness, dressed in a leather apron, short breeches without buckles at the knee, woollen stockings, and carrying a tinker's establishment on his back. He spoke as if he could not stop his tongue when it once began wagging, and fidgeted about all the while he was talking. “Any spoons to run, pots to patch, kettles to mend, anything in my way, colonel? do it—do it—done—as quick as wink.” “Nothing now, Mangham. But where have you been, and where did you last come from, hey?” “Why, I have been to New York, bless your heart, mended six dozen pewter spoons for Sir Henry, patched a copper kettle for the Baroness Knyphausen, ground a pair of scissors for the baron to clip his whiskers, bribed a sentinel with a paper of pins, and came off with full pockets and colours flying.” “Well, well, we all know how much gospel you preach; but tell me now, seriously, what news do you bring?” “Oh! lots of news, colonel. Sir Henry is deeply smitten with a fat Dutch alderman's wife, who can't speak a word of English, and sends her letters every day, which she brings to her husband to read for her. The red coats pay their debts with sterling promises, twenty shillings in the pound; and old Cunningham was detected the other day doing a kindness to a rebel prisoner.” “Come, come, Mangham, I can swallow anything but that. He would sooner be caught picking his pocket, or stealing his allowance. But Thunder and Mars! have done with your jokes, and give us a little gospel. I'll not let you cheat me, if you don't.” “Well, then, seriously, colonel, there is great news— news that will make you stare like a stuck pig—news that will make your queue stand up on end—news that will strike you dumb, deaf, and blind, colonel— news—” “Tinker!” exclaimed the colonel, raising his cane, “if you don't tell what it is without any more of your confounded rigmarole, I'll make the fire fly faster out of your pate than the lies from your mouth. Quick, sir, out with it, or begone about your business.” “Patience, patience, colonel, till I collect my ideas. It is the greatest news, the most extraordinary, the—” “Now do, Mr. Mangham, tell us at once, won't you? I am dying with curiosity,” said Jane. “Oh! when a lady requests it, by all means. Well, then, the news is—and yet I dare say you have heard, —you must have heard it before now, though it's a great secret, only known to people that know everything. I happened to hear them talking it over a bottle after dinner, at Sir Henry's, when they were all a little in for it, and didn't see me popping my head in every now and then.” “Tinker!” cried the colonel, flourishing his cane. “Well, colonel, first and foremost, Arnold has turned traitor.” “You lie! you long-tongued, cheating rascal! He, traitor! the bravest fellow in the whole continental army, except Bloody Anthony, by land and by water. Say that again, and by the Lord Harry I'll set the dogs on you. He, traitor!” “Yes, colonel, as black as an old iron tea-kettle. He has sold his country to the enemy, and his soul to the—hem! mus'nt swear before ladies. It's all signed, sealed, and delivered, army, cannon, West Point, and all.” “Delivered! why, good God! what do you mean?” “No, not exactly delivered, but no thanks to him, as good luck would have it.” “Now look, you tinker, here is a guinea, if you will tell the truth right straight forward, in as few words as possible. Take it, and speak the truth; or lie, and I'll send you to perdition.” “A bargain, colonel—and now I tell you seriously what I heard, though not where I said I did. I heard it all along the road, as I came up, and read it in general orders. By the way, your neighbour's grandson, over yonder, had a finger in the pie.” “He?” ejaculated Jane, turning pale. “Yes—it seems he and two other young men have taken a great spy, with plans of the fortifications at West Point, and a letter from General Arnold, promising to give them all up to Sir Henry, if he would only come and take them. They say John and the other brave lads, have well-nigh saved their country. General Washington has thanked them; Congress has thanked them, and voted them a medal, with the word, `Fidelity,' on the back of it, with a pension besides; and the state of New York has given them each a thumping farm, because they were offered thousands of guineas to let the spy go, but they refused, like honest fellows, to sell their country, and carried him to head-quarters.” “Tinker, on thy soul, is all this true?” “True as gospel, colonel.” “Hold up your head, my darling—don't look so pale,” said the old continental to his daughter. “Why don't you laugh, sing, and dance like me? He won't refuse you now, the conceited blockhead. Fol, lol, de rol— sing, dance, laugh, and be merry, I say—huzza for the Westchester boys! Thunder and Mars! this beats old Ti, out and out. I'll have such a wedding—I'll have such a row! I'll make the whole township reel and sing, dance, drink, and fight any man that won't keep me company. Tinker, you shall be one of the groomsmen, for bringing such good news. Hey diddle, diddle! d—n this old timber leg! Why, Jane—you look as if you were sorry for this!” “He won't think of me, now, father; he is such a great man, and yet I could weep for joy.” “Weep for a fiddlestick! sing, dance, frisk, and be merry, like me; that's the way to be joyful. I never wept for joy in all my life, and hold it a crying sin to fly in the face of good luck in that way. It is what I call ungrateful. Fol, de rol, lol! why, soldiers, why?” “Father,” said Jane, the colour returning to her cheek, “may I walk over to our neighbours, this morning? I heard the good woman was not well. Now don't look so droll at me, sir, you know he is not there, and I should like to be the first to tell them such good news.” “Well—well—go, in God's name. It is a pleasant thing to carry happy tidings. Go, and tell the old folks I will call over and see them this evening—no, to-morrow morning, and mind you come back before dark.” The daughter took her way towards the old stone house, in a tumult of conflicting feelings; which, as they will readily occur to minds of kindred delicacy, and all others would be incapable of comprehending, we shall forbear to analyze. She often lingered on her way, and more than once resolved to return. She stopped along the sequestered path which followed the windings of the stream, to read the past, and reflect on the future. The pride of woman at one moment revolted at the possibility of a suspicion that she was throwing herself in the way of one who had declined the acceptance of her hand; but this feeling was almost instantly quelled by the conviction which had only slept for one moment in her heart, that she was only the dearer to him for his rejection. She had long since done full justice to his motives, and schooled her heart to await the event, whatever it might be. Still, had she not been confident that John was far away, she would most assuredly have denied herself the pleasure she anticipated from being the bearer of news, which she well knew would be received with joy and gratitude. Thus thinking, and thus feeling, she arrived at the old mansion, where she was kindly welcomed by the aged woman, who soon alluded to the long absence of her grandson, saying that he had promised never to leave them more; but that she knew he must be either serving his country, or had become a victim to her cause. The old man, as usual, was rambling about, talking to himself, and picking up sticks, with his bare head exposed to the sun and the wind. The ties of nature, and the recollections of the past, were now as nothing to him. He knew those he was accustomed to see every day, but he knew not who they were, and received the attentions necessary to his forlorn condition, without consciousness, and without gratitude. He entered the house soon after the arrival of Jane, with his bundle of sticks, which he carefully laid on the hearth, and then sat down, talking occasionally to himself, while Jane was relating the story of his grandson. It was received with tempered joy by the old woman, and listless unconsciousness by the poor, stricken patriarch, whose brain seemed to have retained but one single impression. His ear caught the word tory, and he noticed it by repeating his accustomed saying, “Yes, yes—a tory is a highway robber.” It may afford some insight into the operations of the human mind, to state, that among the few books which the old man was accustomed to pore over, in his better days, was a history of the reign of Queen Anne, where a similar derivation is given to the name of tory. Thus passed the time, until just as Jane was preparing to return home, she heard the sound of footsteps approaching, and her heart began to palpitate in her bosom. She hastily retreated through an opposite door, just as John entered by another, and caught only a glance at her shadow as she disappeared. He supposed it was the little waiting maid, and if he thought at all on the subject, his feelings at once took another direction, as he once more received the welcome and blessing of his grandmother. “You need not tell me where you have been, my son; we know it all, and thank God for it.” “And how and where did you hear it, mother?” “Why, from Jane Hammond, there;” for the old dame, seeing none of the clearest, had not observed her silent retreat. “Jane Hammond, there—where?” cried John, eagerly looking round. “Why, I declare! why she was here just the moment you came; but the sly little toad has ran away, I see.” If John had not ran after her, he would be no longer any hero of ours; and we should have left his future adventures at the bottom of the pool of oblivion. He did follow, not on a snail pace, but a hand-gallop, and overtook our heroine just as she entered the sequestered path they had so often trodden in days of yore. She felt him coming—she distinguished his panting breath, and heard him at length whisper: “Jane—dearest Jane, don't run away from me. Stay—dearest Jane, and hear what I have to say in excuse for my former ingratitude. When you hear all, you will forgive me, and once more take me to your heart. Was it indeed you, whose shadow I saw as I came home?” Jane could not tell whether it was herself or not; but it was, perhaps, just as well. In a little time, he felt the soft pressure of a willing hand, which continued locked in his; and would have convinced any one but an infidel, that it was no other than her. One look from John had satisfied her pride and her love. “I know all,” said she, in a low, soft, silvery voice, “and now it is my turn to be proud.” “Ah! Jane—listen to me seriously. My pride has had a fall, and I have suffered severely for it. But now—now—I can ask you without permission; will you trust your happiness to my care? Will you be my dear, dear wife?” “You will not refuse me again?” VOL. II. 15 “Never! unless I become unworthy of you. Answer me, dearest Jane!” The answer of Jane was made in a whisper, which was neither overheard by the echoes, or blabbed by the tell-tale zephyrs, and for that reason it is somewhat doubtful. Some old ladies were of opinion, at the time, that it was conveyed by actions, rather than words, and one went so far as to insinuate that it was delivered in a kiss. Much may be said on both sides, and we hold ourselves entirely uncommitted on this point. All we know, is, that the lovers lost their way, and were a long time before they found it again; so that our hero, in order to beguile the tedious search, was obliged to tell over all the particulars of his last adventure, and its glorious consequences, either two or three times; for there is here, also, some diversity of opinion on this subject. We can only pledge ourselves to what we know, which is, that whatever endearments were mutually given and received, were such, and such only, as became a modest maiden, and an ardent lover, looking forward, with happy certainty, to a speedy union of hands, as well as hearts. None will doubt this, except those incapable of following their example.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. A STOUT CAROUSAL, INTERRUPTED BY UNWELCOME VISITERS, AND CONCLUDED BY A DESSERT OF BOILED LOBSTERS—THE UNHEARD-OF EXPLOITS OF GENERAL TINKERMAN AND LIEUTENANT FLASHFIRE—MARRIAGES, DEATHS, AND FAREWELL EULOGIES. “Tinker,” said the old continental, after the departure of his daughter—“Tinker—or to ennoble thy calling, and render thee worthy of the high honour I intend thee, silversmith—or if you aspire still higher, goldsmith—you shall dine with me to-day. You have brought good news, and the bearer of glad tidings should always be made welcome. You shall dine with the hero of Ticonderoga, eat, drink, and be merry, or die the death of a flincher. I have that in my cellar, that will inspire an old pewter spoon to twinkle like silver. What say you, tinker? I mean goldsmith— shall we be merry, roaring merry—hey?” “With all my heart, colonel; but my dress—my outward and visible man is rather inglorious to sit down in your company. I have left all my wardrobe at home, and am rather out at the elbows, you see.” “Yes, and your face—meaning no offence—is none of the cleanest; but that may be easily remedied. Let me see—aye, that will do. I have a suit of regimentals, which I wore in the old French war, and never mean to put on again, for I don't much stomach the red waistcoat and breeches, just now. They are not much the worse for wear, only a little moth-eaten.” “Oh! never mind, colonel, they'll pass for bullet holes.” “Well, I'll make you a present of them, on this glorious occasion. But, now I think of it, did you ever hear of my carrying Pine's bridge sword in hand?” “Never, colonel.” “Well, I'll tell you that story at dinner. You shall wear my uniform; and that you may be worthy of the honour, I'll promote you. You shall be General Tinkerman. What say you, old gold?” “I say aye, colonel, only I shall then be your commanding officer. How will that answer? I'll make you drink like a fish, depend upon it.” “Thunder and Mars! no, I must be commander in mine own house. But we will not quarrel about rank, as some of the militia officers did at old Ti; I'll tell you that story at dinner. But come, general—go and dress yourself, while I dig up the creature.” “Why, colonel, are we to dine on potatoes, that you talk of digging up our dinner?” “Potatoes! potatoes be — no, general, I mean old stuff imported in Noah's Ark, with a pedigree three times as long as a full blooded racer. I buried it in the cellar, to keep it out of the way of the red coats, who would smell it above ground. I had a case of it at old Ti, and whenever I wanted to do anything desperate, always charged myself with a full bottle. It made me fight like a catamount. But come along, general.” In good time the colonel appeared with the creature, and General Tinkerman in his old colonial uniform, consisting of a blue coat, scarlet waistcoat and breeches, edged with silver lace, a little cocked hat, and a rusty sword at his side. These were reinforced by an old pair of military boots, which had no fellowship with the breeches, for General Tinkerman, be it known, was a tall, raw-boned figure, and the colonel square and stumpy. The breeches absolutely declined to cover his knee-pan; and the boots just reached the calves of his legs, leaving, what the learned call, a hiatus in manuscriptus between them; to hide which, the general had ingeniously made use of his leather apron, all stratagems being allowed in war. The old continental was delighted with his appearance, and they sat down to dinner, where they remained some time better employed than in talking. At length the colonel said: “General, you look like a veteran. One would suppose you were born a field-officer.” “And so I was, colonel. I was born on the field of battle. My father was an illustrious corporal, and my mother a dispenser of spiritual comfort to valiant soldiers. You see, I eat fire by instinct.” “Drink, you mean, general. I reverence a soldier, let him be born where he will. But come, Thunder and Mars! you don't drink—you don't honour your father and mother. And yet, now I look at you, faith, you seem to be rather ticklish in the saddle. Zounds! how you see-saw about, general!” “No, I don't—no I don't, colonel. I'm as steady as 15* a steeple. It's you that begin to be top-heavy, colonel.” “Me! Thunder and Mars! it would take two dozen such fellows as you to force me out of the perpendicular. Come, fill a bumper, and I'll give you a sentiment. Fill, I say, to the brim, and we'll drink supernaculem.” “Well, general, with all my heart, here's the great General Sup—Super—never mind, here he goes.” “What an illiterate blockhead you are, tinker—I mean general. Supernaculem means—it means— hip—here's luck, general.” “Good! I must drink that standing, and in solemn silence. There's nothing I reverence like luck. An ounce of luck is worth a pound of understanding.” “A pound of pewter spoons, you mean—hey, tinker? But drink, valiant Vulcan, drink, I say!” “Why, colonel, it seems to me you have a queer lot of acquaintance. General Super—what d'ye call 'em? and General Vulcan—why, I never heard of them before.” “Not Vulcan! why he is the friend and patron of all tinkers, blacksmiths, and whitesmiths, since the time of Tubal Cain, and before, for aught I know. But drink—drink, I say! standing, sitting, or lying, drink, I say! I'll give you a bumper for every spoon you've run, since you were cradled on the field of glory. Here's to the memory of the immortal Wolfe!” “Standing!” cried the general. “Standing!” echoed the colonel, both rising with no small difficulty, the creature now beginning to operate. “Bravo! Thunder and Mars! general, one would think you had just come out of a long drought. You drink like a sand hill, and roll about like an empty hogshead in a high sea. Steady—steady—you old rusty horn spoon.” “I roll? Damme, colonel, I'll cashier you for insulting your superior officer! I'm as sober as a deacon, but you—you go round like a big spinning-wheel, and make such a humming I can hardly hear myself speak. But talking of humming, what say you to a song, most noble continental?” “Oh! by all means, general—tol, lol, de rol! `Why, soldiers, why;' I could find in my heart to strike up a stave myself, if I could only remember a song or a tune. But come, general, give us a ranting roaring song, about love and murder.” Hereupon, the general began to tune his pipes, and make most villainous wry faces, perfectly original with him, for to the best of our knowledge he had never seen an opera singer in all his life. “Fa, sol, la—hem—la, la, la—hem—hah—I've got a terrible cold. Fa, sol, la—hem!” “Get on, and don't sit there cackling like a Dutch guinea-hen!” “Fa, sol, la—ah! yes, now I have found the right pitch at last.” “Thunder and Mars! pitch away, then, head foremost.” “'Twas in the old French war, they say, At the siege of Ticonderoga—” “Ah! yes, I remember, I was there,” mumbled the colonel to himself. “When the continental army lay With cold almost quite froze-a.” “Yes, yes, it was cold enough, I remember; one of the sentinels had his fingers froze fast to his musket— um—um,” and the old continental began to nod. “Full fifty bold Americans, With hearts that never fail'd them, Were carousing it with flowing cans, When the enemy assail'd 'em.” “How do you like it, colonel?” “Capital!—first-rate, general! `Why, soldiers, why—”' “Surrender, now, all you Yankee crew, Said the captain bold that did lead 'em; Said the Yankee boys, surrender you, With that they up and treed them. “They fought full sixteen years and more—” “That's a lie!” muttered the colonel. “I meant sixteen hours, colonel— “They fought full sixteen hours or more, From sunset to next morning, Says the Yankee boys, I swow and snore—” Here, the colonel, who had gradually fallen asleep in his chair, suiting the action to the word, began to snore most lustily. “Why, colonel, have you no more manners than to join chorus in the middle of a verse? He sleeps like an alderman at afternoon service.” The colonel heard not this expostulation, but continued his nap and his accompaniment, which had all the various modulations of an organ, with the newly invented stops. Sometimes it rolled up in a lofty diapason, and then suddenly sunk into thorough bass; sometimes it seemed whistling through a quill, and anon it burst forth with such stupendous and transcendant exuberance, as to threaten the total disruption of the instrument itself. Its variety was inexhaustible; its transitions, sometimes gentle and insinuating, at others abrupt and ferocious; and occasionally it sent forth a long, lingering, Alexandrine note, that gradually dwindled away like a distant expiring echo. Its variety was, indeed, inexhaustible, and as the colonel seemed in no haste to finish the concert, the general, it being now dark, reclined back in his chair, and soon accompanied him in his visit to the land of Nod, as well as in his music. Nor were they in the least disturbed by Mingo bringing in candles. From this harmonious repose, the general, who, as he affirmed, always slept with one eye open, was roused by the unceremonious intrusion of a party of red coats, consisting of some half dozen, who rushed in with drawn swords, crying out, “Surrender, you rebel rascals, surrender!” The colonel, partly between sleeping and waking, being still inspired by the creature, exclaimed, at hearing the word rebels— “Thunder and Mars! who talks of rebels? D—n the red coats, d—n the tories, and most emphatically d—n the Yagers! Down with them, boys; huzza for old Ti!” “What's that you say, you old rebel scoundrel?” said the commanding officer, “we'll teach you another tune presently.” During this brief colloquy, the tinker had mounted his cocked hat, and ensconcing himself behind the table in order to hide his leather apron, cried out in a most magisterial tone— “Rebel scoundrel! Is that the way you speak to a gentleman under my protection, and of whose hospitality I am now partaking, sir? Do you see this uniform, sirrah? Put up your sword and troop off this instant, or you shall run the gauntlet through the whole British army.” “I—I—beg pardon, sir, I—I—may I ask your honour who I have the honour of speaking to?” said the petty officer who led the party, taking off his hat and bowing with great humility. “Speaking to, sir? Know, fellow, you are speaking to General Tinkerman, of the Trudging Heroes. Who are you, fellow, that you don't know me?” “I beg pardon, sir, but I—I—really, though I've been all my life in the service, I don't think—I'm sure I never heard your name before. You probably served—” “Served! Know, fellow, I never served. I always commanded. I have had ten thousand such ragamuffins as you under me at one time. So troop, sir, troop, I say, or I'll have you tried by a drum-head court-martial, and shot for disobedience of orders before you can say your prayers.” During this lofty harangue, General Tinkerman had imprudently advanced from behind his entrenchment, so that he exposed himself not to the fire, but the reconnoisance of the enemy, who detected his leather apron. The crest-fallen officer, not recollecting that particular uniform, began to see through the deception. Advancing, and lifting up the unlucky garment, he cried out— “Why, general, what's this? You must be a freemason, as well as a field-officer. Pray, what corps do you belong to? Here, my men, take the general into custody, and mind he don't cut all your throats.” Accordingly they laid hold of the general with such loud shouts of laughter, that they at length fairly roused the colonel, who, yawning, and rubbing his eyes. mumbled out— “Hey! yaw—w—w—why tinker, you laugh double. You seem as merry as a cricket. Well, to it again, my son. Another glass of the stuff, and we'll drink confusion to King George, and all his rascally red coats.” “You will, will you?” said the officer. “Tinker! and so, sir, you are a general, sir. You've commanded ten thousand such ragamuffins as me. You'll make us run the gauntlet before the whole army, will you? You'll try us by a drum-head court-martial, and hang us before we can say our prayers, will you?” And he turned the tinker round and round, to the infinite diversion of his comrades. The colonel, who was now wide awake, if not duly sober, gradually came to his recollection, and gazing around him, at length asked: “Why, what is all this? Why, Thunder and Mars! who are you, and what business have you here, hey?” “We'll soon let you know, old gentleman. You have lately become known at head-quarters for one of the most malignant old rebels in the whole county, and I am sent here to gallant you to the city, where you will stay till you learn to cry God save the king!” “I'll be shot first!” said the colonel. “Well, we shall see. But come, my men, here is wine, I see—fill a bumper to King George, and may all the rebels be hanged! Why, zounds! where did you get this wine, old dog? It is fit for the king. But you have not done honour to the toast; come, sir, drink, I entreat you!” And he bowed low in derision. “Well, I'll drink, because I love good wine, and I like to make people welcome, though I must say you have come rather unceremoniously. But I'll not drink your toast, because I don't like it. A man has a right to his own toast, to his own wine; so here's success to liberty!” “And here's God save the king—of good fellows,” cried General Tinkerman, sinking his voice to a whisper at the concluding part of his toast. “Down with the old rebel!” exclaimed the officer, “or rather up with him. I'll hang him on the spot, unless he drinks my toast, as I am gentleman and a Christian.” “He'll hang a man on the spot for not drinking a toast, to prove himself a gentleman and a Christian,” thought the general. The old continental resolutely refused to establish his loyalty by drinking the king, and a halter being procured from the stable, where they found Mingo fast asleep, he having verified the old adage, like master, like man, they proceeded to fasten it round the colonel's neck by a slipping noose, to the great consternation of the general, who began to feel a disagreeable sensation about the throat, and believed his turn would come next. All things being prepared, and the toast once more proposed, and rejected by the stout old continental with disdain, they were proceeding seriously to execute their purpose; and had actually raised him on tiptoe, when, at this critical moment, our hero, who, as before stated, having been delayed by losing his way, approached the house, accompanied by Jane. His attention was first attracted by seeing various figures moving backwards and forwards past the windows; and he had not proceeded many steps further, when the sight of several horses tied to the paling of the garden fence, greatly increased his alarm. He saw that there were visiters, and a closer inspection convinced him they were not friends, for he could distinguish through the window, that they were offering violence to the colonel. He hastily returned to Jane, and in as few words as possible, informed her of the state of things within. This information was followed by the proposal of a plan, which was the only one that occurred to him in this sudden emergency. He asked if she had the resolution to play her part, and was eagerly assured, that to save her father, she was capable of anything. He then pulled off his coat and hat, with which he equipped the young maiden, at the same time giving her the necessary instructions. He next approached the window, and dashing a pane of glass to atoms, roared out in a voice of thunder: “Surrender! you rascally red coats, or you are dead men! Down with your arms this instant!” “Surrender! you rascally red coats!” echoed Jane from another window in the rear, while both moved VOL. II. 16 about rapidly, making as much noise as possible, and in every variety of tone. They were just in the nick of time; for the officer having allowed the colonel five minutes to say his prayers, was just on the point of making good his claim to the character of a gentleman and a Christian, when the summons to surrender, which seemed to come from fifty different quarters, brought them to a dead pause. After a few moments of reflection, the valiant subaltern responded: “Who are we to surrender to?” “To Captain Flashfire's troop of dragoons, eight and forty strong! Deliver your arms out of the window, or you are all dead men!” “Down with your arms, villains!” cried Jane, “or we'll cut the throats of every man, woman, and child, in fifty miles round!” “Bless my heart!” said General Tinkerman, “what a bloodthirsty fellow that Captain Flashfire is! I tell you what, my friends, you'd better hand out your arms at once, or in less than fifteen minutes, you'll all be as dead as mutton! I know him of old; if he once gets his dander up, it's all over with you. There! there! there! he begins again!” “Hand out your arms this minute, or we'll blow you all sky high!” cried John, in a terrible voice. The officer finding such odds against him, obeyed the summons, and the arms were handed out through the broken window. John then entered the house, accompanied by Captain Flashfire; and his first act was to free the colonel, who had scarcely yet recovered his breath, and stood staring around, half unconscious of what was going forward. Indeed, he had been all but suffocated. Our hero then very courteously addressed himself to the officer, stating that his men had become so exasperated by the reports of the ill-usage of their countrymen during their imprisonment in New York, that they had sworn vengeance against the first red coats that fell into their hands. He could, at present, think of no other way to protect them from their fury, than tying their hands behind them. His men were on the whole generous fellows, and would never think of doing violence to defenceless prisoners. The officer at once assented, at the same time begging his protection; and additional halters being procured, the valiant commander and his party had their arms well secured behind their backs. John having thus released the colonel, and secured his prisoners, proceeded to interrogate them, as to who they were, whence they came, and the object of their coming; in the course of which he detected his old friend Boshin, who had retired into a corner, and seemed by no means desirous of exciting observation. His blood boiled at sight of the caitiff, and he called out in a loud voice, “Case Boshin, stand forth!” Case crawled out, trembling like a detected criminal. “How come you by that uniform?” “I have enlisted in the regiment of loyal Americans.” “Since when?” “About three months ago.” “Liar and rascal! Within less than that time you robbed, and almost murdered my grandfather. Do you remember the ghost of the bridge? You see I know all about it. You have now come here to rob and murder in the disguise of a uniform, already sufficiently disgraced by atrocities which no circumstances can justify. I owe you two good turns for myself, and one for my country. You did all you could to bring me to a disgraceful death; you deprived my poor old grandfather of his reason, and you have deserted your country, to side with her enemies. The day of reckoning has come, and you shall pay it to the last farthing, as sure as you live.” Case made no reply, but retired in dogged silence to his corner. After some little consultation, it was decided to confine the prisoners in the root-house, whither they were conducted, and placed under guard of General Tinkerman, assisted by old Mingo, who having previously refreshed himself with a long nap, declared he could keep awake the rest of the night, if the general would only talk to him. The next day Mingo was despatched with a letter to the commandant at West Point, and the day following, the prisoners were marched under a guard sent down for them, to that post. Here Case, being recognised as a deserter, suffered the severest penalty of military law, and the others were treated according to their demerits. The colonel having by this time sufficiently recovered his breath and recollection, recognised his deliverer, whom he welcomed with all the warmth of grateful affection. After which, he inquired for Captain Flashfire, who stood ensconced behind General Tinkerman, that worthy having left Mingo on guard, while he came to light his pipe, as he said, though the truth is, he was anxious to see what would be the end of this affair. “I beg pardon, sir,” said John, in answer to the colonel's inquiry, “permit me to introduce Captain Flashfire, as brave an officer as ever drew trigger. He is bullet proof. He fears no man living, I'll say that for him. Lieutenant Flashfire, Colonel Hammond; a gallant officer who distinguished himself at the siege of Ticonderoga, in the old French war.” “Your hand, Captain Flashfire,” said the old continental. “Thunder and Mars! it feels like velvet! Sir, you have saved my life from these hang-dogs, and mine is at your service. Permit me to bid you welcome, and to assure you my house, and everything in it is yours,” and the colonel bowed profoundly, with the halter still hanging about his neck. “A trifle—a trifle, colonel,” replied the captain, disguising his voice a little. “Don't mention it—don't mention it, I beg of you. It isn't the first time by a hundred. I generally kill half a dozen men of a morning, and quiet my conscience by saving as many in the afternoon.” “The d—I you do!” He talks like a militia-man who has looked the enemy in the face across a river, thought the colonel. “But come, captain, pull off your coat, which, by the way—you will excuse me, sir—looks as if it had outgrown you; and your hat, which—hem! A glass of wine, sir. Permit me—I drink your good health, and yours, John, and yours, General Tinkerman. But now I think of it, where is the rest of your company? Let them come in, there is room and welcome for them all.” “You see all our company, sir; Captain Flashfire and I,” said John. 16* “What, hey! Thunder and Mars! a ruse, as the French used to say at old Ti. You young rascal, you learnt that of me. Isn't it so? I'll never forgive you, if it isn't a ruse.” “Something like it, colonel. But, captain, suppose you pull off your hat and coat, and make yourself at home. No one has a better right.” “I can deny you nothing;” and the captain complied. “What, hey! why, sure! Why, you impudent baggage, are you not ashamed of campaigning about in men's clothes? Who made you a captain?” “My commander, here. I would be made anything, to assist in saving the life of my dear father.” “Ah! a chip of the old block. And so you two alone have saved me from these scoundrels. John,” added the colonel, with dignified solemnity, “John, I owe my life to you, and—and Captain Flashfire. You have preserved me from a death unworthy of a soldier. In what way can I repay the obligation? Zounds! I have it. I'll give you half my estate.” John shook his head. “No? well, what say you to the whole?” Again John shook his head. “Why, you unreasonable dog! Well, I have nothing else to give, except what you once rejected. I am too proud of myself and my daughter, to send her begging for a husband, especially since I hear you are grown such a great man all at once; thanked by General Washington; thanked by Congress; voted a medal, and all that. Thunder and Mars! I suppose you will look down on the old continental colonel and his daughter, now!”—and the colonel began to wax wroth. “Ask your daughter,” said John. “What! has he made the amen honourable, as the French used to say at old Ti? Has he gone down on his knees, acknowledged himself a puppy, and begged your pardon with his nose in the dirt?” “He has given me satisfactory reasons, sir.” “And what were they?” “I can't remember them,” replied Jane, blushing. “Ah—well—um—I suppose it is all right. Come hither, Captain Flashfire;—ah! you little vixen! Here, John, take her, you puppy; but mind you keep a tight rein. Thunder and fire! how she strutted and swore! Surrender, this instant, or we'll blow you sky high! Surrender! you scoundrels, or we'll cut the throats of every man, woman and child in fifty miles round! and then she kills six men a day, and saves the lives of as many more to quiet her conscience! But come to my arms, that I may kiss you once more before I give you away. There, take her, John, with all my heart, and all my money—witness, General Tinkerman.” “I do,” said the general, “and may I have the running of all the pewter spoons.” “Silver, you old empty tin canister! They shall have nothing but silver in the house! Hey! Johnny, my son?” “Silver, pewter, horn or wood, all one, sir. To me, her only treasure is herself; silver and gold are nothing to such a heart, enshrined in such a casket.” “Hey diddle, diddle! the puppy grows poetical. But take her, John, such as heaven made her. I give her to you as the best of daughters, and such ever make the best of wives. I give her to you as the reward of patriotism and fidelity.” The wedding took place shortly afterwards; but the consummation of his love, did not subdue our hero's patriotism. He remained at home during the remainder of the winter; but joined the American army at the commencement of the campaign, with the consent of Jane, who said with tears in her eyes, and blushes on her cheeks, “I know it is your duty to go, and mine to part with you, though it cuts me to the heart. But I never wish to be the wife of any but a freeman, or the mother of slaves.” He served during the remainder of the war; performed many hardy exploits, was present at the closing scene at York Town; and returned home with the rank of major, to enjoy the blessings of that liberty for which he had so faithfully laboured, and so severely suffered. Nor should it be forgotten that his two companions, Isaac and David, attended the wedding, where the latter made the bride not a little jealous by joking the bridegroom about the beautiful fortune-teller. The two equally shared with John the gratitude of their country, and lived long after the conclusion of the war, in credit and renown. The old couple at the stone house, did not, however, live to see and share the blessings of freedom. They died within a few weeks of each other, and slid out of the world so easily, that their last sleep came on like the hour of balmy rest, after a long summer day of toil. The last words of the old man were—“Yes, yes, a tory is a highway robber.” They were quietly borne to the grave, where they lay side by side, awaiting the unfolding of that awful mystery which the living never penetrate, and the dead never disclose. General Tinkerman—once a general, always a general—survived the war, during which he had saved money enough to set up in business in New York, in the pewter and tin line. Being a long-sighted man, he purchased a swamp just at the outskirts of the city, which in process of time became at length so valuable, that the general deserted his caste, and went over to the aristocracy. The more the price of the swamp rose, the more weighty became his influence, both in politics, morals, and religion, and his opinions concerning public measures and the weather, were decisive. He bore his honours as if he had inherited them from the time of William the Conqueror, and it was exceedingly edifying to hear him dilate on the “mushroom nobility,” or the intolerable impudence of tag-rag and bobtail democracy, as he termed the good people, who had fought for their country while he was running pewter spoons and selling pins and needles. To sustain his pretensions, he selected for his carriage a great coat of arms, of sixteen quarterings, which he found in an old book of heraldry in the city library, and, in short, became one of the granite pillars of the aristocracy of the great emporium. Finally, when he died—for all men must die—the newspapers of the time solemnly announced, that “A great man had fallen in Israel.” Artemas Day, in like manner, lived to a good old age, doubtless by virtue of his devotion to dried apples and molasses and water, and became a richer man than his neighbour, the old continental, by the aid of hard bargains and labour-saving machines. Such was the rigid propriety of his outward man, that it was taken for granted by those who never had anything to do with him, that the inward man must be equally unexceptionable. He was consequently highly respected abroad, though it must be confessed he was marvellously despised nearer home, thereby verifying the saying, that “prophets have no honour in their own country.” The little mischievous boys of the neighbourhood, those shrewd judges of human character, seldom missed an opportunity of doing him an ill turn, by robbing his orchard and flouting his spare-ribbed horse, as he rode along with the resignation of a martyr. The last act of his life which has come to our knowledge, was his contriving, by some means or other, to get a pension for his revolutionary services, which consisted in holding friendly intercourse with the enemy, and taking a protection for his person and property. There was a sermon preached at his funeral, in which he was greatly exalted, and Zoroaster Fisk tasked his genius in works of fiction so successfully, that neither man, woman, nor innocent babe, in all the churchyard, left behind them such a character for piety, integrity, and benevolence. Our heroine, in the opinion of those who best knew her, made a wife of at least a hundred thousand, though it is traditionary that she paid such exclusive attention to her first-born, that both John and the colonel were sometimes a little jealous. It was considered somewhat remarkable that she dressed plainer as she grew older, and that her husband actually thought she became handsomer every day, although she had a bad habit of giving him advice which cannot be sufficiently reprehended. She was pious, without being priestridden, and never went to a night meeting but once, when she caught a great cold, which the colonel swore by Thunder and Mars, was a judgment upon her. Her greatest fault was a blameable indifference to the concerns of her neighbours, into which she never pried except with a view of relieving their necessities, so that never was woman more deficient in that knowledge which concerns everybody but ourselves. With this exception, we would venture to pronounce her perfect, had she not once nearly fainted at a proposition of John to apprentice his third son to a trade, instead of making him a lawyer. The old continental, after the marriage of his daughter, abandoned all his contemplated improvements and labour-saving machines, having got a new set of playthings in the person of divers little grandchildren, whom he did his best to spoil, and then swore by Thunder and Mars, it was all owing to the weak indulgence of the mother. John found him a very amusing companion of evenings, only he told the stories of old Ti and Pine's bridge rather too often. But to do the good man justice, he made all the amends in his power, by adding, altering, or diminishing something at every repetition, thereby producing a perpetual variety. Old Mingo sometimes took the liberty of setting him right, but such is the ingratitude of mankind that all he got for his pains was either a sharp reprimand, or a provoking insinuation that the poor old negro had outlived his recollection. He not unfrequently scolded Jane, and generally when she least deserved it. This, her husband did not much relish, either because he thought it unmerited, or that this was his exclusive privilege. The old continental lived to a patriarchal age, without ever suffering any severe pain, or actual disease, except on one occasion, when he nearly died of laughter on reading in the newspapers a pompous eulogium on that pillar of aristocracy, General Tinkerman, and that a great man had fallen in Israel. Towards the close of his life, his daughter succeeded in persuading him, that it was unbecoming his years to deal so much in Thunder and Mars, and he promised to do his best to abstain. The good gentleman succeeded during three days, by scarcely opening his mouth at all, but on the morning of the fourth, it was observed that he broke out again, and made himself ample amends for his abstinence. Our happy trio—for happy they were, notwithstanding the little rubs of domestic life—lived to enjoy the blessings of that freedom, for the attainment of which, each in their appropriate sphere, had paid a just proportion of anxieties and suffering. They lived to see their country increasing in prosperity and happiness, beyond all former examples; to see it expanding in extent, growing in vigour, and giving new force to the principles, new sanctity to the name of liberty, by exhibiting an example of its glorious consequences. While enjoying the present, and anticipating still greater triumphs in the future, they often reverted to the past, and recalled to mind the hardships and sufferings of the revolutionary struggle, John would often exclaim—“It was the Price of Liberty!” THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MONTEZUMA. Montezuma, the last of the Aztecs. An Historical Romance on the conquest of Mexico. By Edward Maturin. 2 vols., 12mo. Paper, $1 00; Cloth, $1 50. “Mr. Maturin in making choice of scene and character, has evinced that self-reliance of true genius, with unmistakable evidences of which the work abounds. To the magnificent episode of the `Curse of Quetzalcotal,' we adverted in the last number; and reading it over again in connection with the Romance, we are struck with the power of its execution.” —Knickerbocker. “This work alone will stamp the author not only as an accomplished scholar but a man of genius. We would rather be the author of `Montezuma,' than of half James's Novels.” —Vindicator. “Montezuma is a book that will be read universally; it has the indelible impress of genius.” —Columbian Magazine. “This is really work of genius—we hail it with pleasure, and gladly commend it to our readers, who will have an unusual treat in its persual, and no doubt ask for more of the same.” —Evening Mirror. “The name of the author alone ought to sell this book. The romantic tone of his father's mind seems to have descended in undiminished fervor to Mr. Maturin, and his last of the Aztecs, is richly steeped in its poetic hue.” —Hoffman's Excelsior. “It has features of strong interest, and will be widely read with general admiration.” —Courier and Enquirer. “This is a powerful work, and one of genius—worthy the reading of every lover of poetic mind, a vivid imagination, and cultivated scholarship. It will find its way, and we are mistaken if it becomes not much talked of, much thought of, and much and well read.” —Tribune. “We have read it with delight.” —U. S. Gazette. “This is a Romance of uncommon power and deep interest. The young author is a son of the celebrated author of Bertram, universally regarded as one of the finest productions of modern times. This fact entitles the son to a generous and candid hearing. His romance has now been some weeks before the public, and it has met with almost universal favor. It is worthy of longer, more careful and critical notice than our daily press can give any book, in the rush of public affairs; nor have we yet seen in any quarter any very minute criticism of Montezuma. We shall endeavor to furnish ourselves at no distant period. There is no haste about such books; this, particularly, is one that cannot be borne down to oblivion by the impetuous tide of cheap literature. It is a work which wakes up passion in the soul of every reader; no man who reads it can forget it; one year or ten years will not blot its finely drawn scenes from the memory. They will live in the recollection, as Walter Scott's battle pieces, and Cooper's sea fights live in the memories of the millions who have read them. “To those of our readers who have ever felt that they could repose confidence in our literary judgment, we warmly recommend Montezuma, as one of the most brilliant and powerful historical romances ever written in this country.” —National Press.</field>

Cloth, 75 cents; Paper, 50 cents. “We know of no book which affords a more striking illustration of the beauty of the `golden main' in style—that pours a cheerful sun-light over every page, and yet never dwindles into sentimentalism.” —National Press. “The quick, but searching observation of females, combined with the taste peculiar to the sex, and the gift of language, which they possess in a pre-eminent degree, render the ladies delightful tourists. “The fair authoress before us presents a rich banquet to the public, both in the scenes described, and in the happy manner of treating them. “Visiting, as she has, the most important places in Europe, she flies from one to another, in her narrative, with the same vivacity that some of her musical sisters exhibit in touching the keys of a piano, while she affords more lasting and intellectual gratification.” —New Haven Courier. “We can commend the book to our readers; we are sure that they will agree with us that upon the whole they have seldom met with a more agreeable piece of gossip.” —Harbinger.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MAN IN THE REPUBLIC. Man in the Republic. A Series of Poems. By Cornelius Matthews. 1 vol., 32mo., gilt edges. 37½ cents. “It has, in the midst of faults, neither few nor small, an unequivocal originality and young force and freshness of its own, vigorous in its very rudeness and immaturity, together with a certain earnest spirit of Americanism which comes to us like a breath of new life; of the west wind from our lofty, fast-rooted American mountains, over the stagnant vapors of the East—the East which blows that sirocco so deadly to American energy.” —Democratic Review. “He writes not only like a man, but like a Republican and an American. Under this rough bark is a heart of oak; and peradventure a noble vessel, if not a Dodonean oracle, may presently be had out of it. The wood has a good grain, the timber is of large size; and, if gnarled and knotted, these are the conditions of strength, and perhaps the convulsions of growth. It is thus that strong trees grow, while slim grasses spring smoothly from the ground. And the thoughtful student of the literature of America will pause naturally and musingly, at the sight of this little book, and mark it as something `new and strange,' considering the circumstances of the soil.” —Tait's Edinburgh Magazine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHALLENGE OF BARLETTA. Ettiore Fieramosca; or, the Challenge of Barletta. An Historical Romance of the Times of the Medici. By Massimo D'Azeglio. Translated from the Italian, by C. Edwards Lester. 1 vol., 12mo. Price 50 cents in paper, 75 cents cloth. “This work is deliciously written, and admirably translated.” —N. Y. Mirror. “This work is written with great ability, and will be found extremely interesting.” —Evening Post. “The Challenge of Barletta has been frequently designated by the British and Italian critics as the best romance of its language. It is certainly a vivacious work.” —Broadway Journal. “The author appears to have brought to the task the most untiring industry and research, and to have literally exhausted the infinite resources of his inimitable genius, in portraying the passions and impulses which prompt to human action.” —Poughkeepsie Journal and Eagle. “The `Challenge of Barletta' brings before us the manners, customs, stirring events, and some of the contemporaries of the times of Gonzales de Cordova, the illustrious general of Ferdinand and Isabella; and the particular event which furnishes the ground work of the romance is alluded to by Prescott, the historian, in a note. The Great Captain is presented to us in all his glory, with many of the chivalric spirits of the age; while the pastimes of the day—the tournament, the bull-fight, the theatre, and the banquet—are set forth in graphic descriptions.” —Salem Register.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FLORENTINE HISTORIES. Florentine Histories. By Nicolo Machiavelli. 2 volumes, 12mo. Price $1 00 paper, $1 50 bound. “The history of the origin, rise and progress of the Florentine Republic, by whomsoever written, provided the requisite accuracy and discrimination in the collection and arrangement of the materials were secured, could not fail of possessing a deep interest for every cultivated and enlightened mind—for every American who has been accustomed, in his survey of ancient and modern history, to dwell with rapture over the brilliant annals of the Italian Republics of the Middle Ages, where the germ of modern liberty and modern civilization first presents itself to view. But when he is enabled to retrace this fertile field of great events, of great ideas, of great and good men, and of great and lasting results upon the fortune of the race, with the all-accomplished but much abused and strangely misrepresented Machiavelli—the shrewd, observing, practical and experienced statesman— the deep and penetrating philosopher—the disguised but no less firm and uncompromising patriot—the cautious and wary, but upright politician, he feels that he is imbibing ample and invigorating draughts from the very wellspring of historic truth.” —Albany Argus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ARTIST, MERCHANT AND STATESMAN. The Artist, Merchant and Statesman of the Age of the Medici, and of our own Times. Illustrated by steel line engravings of Americus Vespucius and Hiram Powers. By C. Edwards Lester, Esq. 2 vols., 12mo. Paper, $1 00, cloth, $1 50. Contents.—Vol. 1. A Letter on the Genius and Sculptures of Powers; 2. An Apology for Powers; 3. Conversations with Powers in his Studio at Florence, serving as an Autobiography of the Sculptor, with a History of his Life and Works; 4. Letter on the Genius of Powers; 5. A Letter on the Establishment of a new Consular system. Contents.—Vol. 2. 1. Florence; 2. The Vespucci Family; 3. The Church of Santa Cisco; 4. Michael Angelo; 5. Galileo; 6. Congress of Literary Men; 7. Portrait of Vespucius; 8. Botta, and his Works; 9. Social Life and National Spirit of America; 10. Models for Artists; 11. Criticism of the Venus de Medici; 12. Giving as good as is sent; 13. Passages from the History of the Fine Arts in America. “Enthusiastic and glowing like every thing he writes.” —Courier and Enquirer. “We have read no work on art comparable to this.” —Evening Mirror. “We have dwelt with delight on those pages of Powers' memoirs which contain his impressions of art—they are perspicuous and happy—they are often eloquent and grand—they fascinate and instruct us at the same time. He speaks of art as we can imagine a Plato to have taught Philosophy. He invests it with a charm and novelty which is truly wonderful.” —New Orleans Tropic. “The candid American reader will welcome this book, and render to the author an approving judgment in consideration of the spirit and intention manifest in its contents—the spirit of patriotism, glowing and energetic, and nobly striving to make itself usefully effective.” —Evening Post. “The memoir of Powers will be read with pleasure by every lover of genius. It traces him, step by step, from his birth-place in Vermont, the eighth son of a poor farmer, as errand-boy, clock-maker, and wax-moulder, to his present proud position, confessedly the first sculptor in the world. It is a tale of trials and struggles, of sad privation, and of bitter disappointment, which has sent many a crushed heart to an early grave; but through all, and in spite of all, Powers hoped and toiled on, until he has won a name of which his country may well be proud. There is a lesson in these pages for the weak and desponding, that should be studied, and never forgotten; and we cordially commend them to our readers.” —Morning Courier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RAMBLES BY LAND AND WATER. Rambles by Land and Water; or, Notes of Travel in Cuba and Mexico, including a Canoe Voyage up the River Panuco, and Researches among the Ruins of Tamaulipas, etc. By B. M. Norman. Richly illustrated with Tinted Lithographs. 1 vol., 12mo. $1 00. “It is replete with interest, more especially that part which treats of the ancient ruins and curious antiquities of America. Mr. Norman is at home in this department of our national literature; and the views he presents in regard to them, though differing from those of some other able writers on the subject, are well stated, and ably sustained. The engravings are fine, and the whole book will be found exceedingly readable and instructive. It contains some incidents of deep and thrilling interest; and some of the pictures—that of the American Sphinx, for example—are more curious than any that have yet been drawn from that faithful field. The only regret his readers will feel in laying down his book, will be, that there is not more of it.” —N. O. Commercial Times. “We have previously noticed this work, but a thorough perusal justifies a further review. The readers of the Courier will recollect we were favored with a drawing of `The American Sphinx,' and description thereof, in advance of the publication of these Rambles. A better recollection, however, will be, the adventures and sketches we published from the eloquent pen of the estimable author, Mr. Norman, in his Travels in Yucatan, &amp;c. That was one of the most interesting books of American travel ever published—and we think this volume of Rambles in Cuba and Mexico will prove equally acceptable to the reading public. It includes a Canoe Voyage up the river Panuco, and Researches among the Ruins of Tamaulipas, &amp;c. `He turns his craft to small advantage, Who knows not what to light it brings.' “Norman is one of the most modest men in our literature. To our judgment, his style puts us more in mind of the simple and unaffected, but eloquent and rich delineations and descriptions of Washington Irving, than any other American writer. He has produced but few books, but they are gems of travel, and make us desire most anxiously more from his buoyant and good-humored pen. We like his Rambles by Land and Water, and all his Notes of Travel, very much; and this last series of pictures from his pen and pencil are to us equally interesting as his Rambles in Yucatan, Central America, &amp;c.” —Phil. Saturday Courier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MORRIS'S SONGS AND BALLADS. Songs and Ballads. By George P. Morris. First complete edition. 1 vol., 32mo., gilt edges. 37½ cents. “What can be said of Morris's Melodies? they have been sung by so many angel voices, and admired by so many of our fair country-women, that it is only necessary to announce the name of this volume, to present a long cherished acquaintance, a loved friend.” —N. O. Commercial Times. “The Melodies of `Morris' are so well known, and so fully appreciated, that they need no eulogy from us.” —Albany Spectator.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE GREECE OF THE GREEKS. The Greece of the Greeks. By G. A. Perdicaris, A. M., late United States' Consul at Athens. 2 vols., 12mo. Illustrated with 12 tinted lithographs. Price $1 50 cents. “The volumes before us are worthy of an attentive perusal. Indeed they will command perusal from any one who glances at the first volume; he will scarcely lay them down until he reads them through. The work has been to Mr. Perdicaris a labor of love; a native of Greece, and yet a proficient in our language, having been educated in the United States, he brought to the compilation of his work an intimate acquaintance with his subject, and a graceful pleasing style which never wearies. The work is interspersed with interesting anecdotes and classical allusions. But it is further useful, giving as it does, a brief and comprehensive history of Greece since its disenthralment from the Turkish yoke, and explaining its present political position. Mr. Perdicaris shows conclusively, that the designs of England and the other European powers, in favoring the freedom of Greece, have been selfish and disengenuous. We heartily commend the book to all those who love that land of glorious memories; and who is not an enthusiastic lover of Greece? Who has not sympathized with her sufferings, and rejoiced at her enfranchisement? “The work is got up by the publishers in choice style, and is illustrated with spirited engravings, from sketches of the gorgeous and classic scenery of Greece. It has also portraits of the present king and queen of Greece, dressed in the picturesque costume of the country.” —New York Vindicator. “There is something so sacred, so classic—may we not say so touching, in the very name of Greece; it so calls up every heroic sentiment, and every refined feeling, that it is difficult to embody one's thoughts even of such a book as the two handsome volumes before us, without so much of this feeling rushing upon the mind, as to render the task not facile of attainment.” —National Magazine. “His brief and chaste sketches of the prominent incidents in the adventurous lives of the heroes of Greece, as exhibited in their deeds of bravery during the revolution, have all the charms and exciting interest of romance. With all that pertains to a comprehensive delineation of the present aspect of the affairs of the Greeks, and incidental sketches of the most exciting scenes of their late struggle in the cause of freedom, Mr. Perdicaris has so happily blended the whole with classic allusions and philosophical reflections, as to render his work alike interesting to the scholar and the statesman; and not only so, but of general interest to all, while it will become the indispensable vade-mecum of future travellers in Greece.” —Ev. Mir.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CITIZEN OF A REPUBLIC. The Citizen of a Republic, what are his rights, his duties, and privileges, and what should be his education. By Ansaldo Ceba. 1 vol., 12mo. Price 50 cents paper, 75 cents cloth. “It is the production of a republican, a philosopher, a patriot, and a philanthropist, and should be made a class book in our schools and colleges. We earnestly commend it to American youth of all classes. We have seen nothing in it that can offend any religious sect, political party, profession, occupation or calling. It is patriotic throughout.” —New York Sun. “Citizen of a Republic, by Ansaldo Ceba, one of the most illustrious of the stern and heroic republicans who flourished in the times of the Medici. He was a person who figured in troubled times—the sixteenth century; when the spirit of learning and freedom had just begun to triumph over the powers of darkness and despotism. His convictions were strong, and he wrote with a solemn earnestness of purpose. Taking the side of virtue, and at the same time of liberty, his counsels are peculiarly adapted to the young men of this country. It is, in short, a dissertation on moral and social education, conceived in a broad and lofty feeling of human responsibility and progressiveness.” —N. Y. Evening Post. “Ansaldo Ceba has been always considered as one of the ablest of Italian writers on government, and the work now published is the most important which he has given to the world. If we regard only our conception of the word `Republic,' we shall find his title a misnomer; but the book itself is full of a thoroughly republican sentiment, and inculcates the democratic virtues. It is, indeed, a noble composition, replete with learning, thought, and the purest classification.” —Broadway Journal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRIPPINGS IN AUTHORLAND. Trippings in Authorland. By Fanny Forester. 1 vol., 12mo. Paper 50 cents, Cloth 75 cents. “A style more pure, simple and affecting—an imagination more brilliant and chaste, and a heart more overflowing with generous and tender sympathies, never blessed a writer, or charmed a reader.” —N. O. Delta. “The gentle, smiling, inimitable Fanny Forester. Every page sparkles with gladness, and teems with pleasant thoughts, and lovely pictures of domestic joys.” —Columbian Magazine. “A delightful volume, replete with pure thoughts and just sentiments, in a diction at once elegant and graceful.” —Hunt's Magazine. “She writes with the power and ease of an Ariel, and trips as lightly over the fields as if he had lent her not only his feet, but his wings.” —Evening Mirror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF ALFIERI. The Autobiography of Vittorio Alfieri, the Tragic Poet, born at Asti, 1749, died at Florence, 1803. Contents.—Period 1. Infancy, embracing nine years of vegetation; 2. Youth, nine years of in-education; 3. Ten years of Travelling and dissipation; 4. More than thirty years of devotion to letters. “Vittorio Alfieri was unquestionably one of the mighty masters of the Italian muse. His dramas, though built on the classic model, and very different from those standards which the great achievements in British tragedy have made equally familiar and classical to us, are productions of remarkable symmetry and vigor. They embody, as was embodied in the whole heart of their author, the stern inflexible genius of republicanism. They are compositions of strength rather than tenderness; of majesty and terror, rather than of grace and sweetness; yet they have a delicacy, and possess a purity of nature, which is due to the severe simplicity of soul which so largely distinguished the character of Alfieri. This character is written, by himself, in the autobiography before us. This narrative seems to us one of the most curious, as one of the most honest, in literary history. —Charleston Transcript. “This biography, from the pen of its subject, the poet who pictured the softness of Italian scenery, and the romantic characteristics of his nation, in his beautiful dramatic productions, is given to us in a style that partakes alike of the poem and the novel.” —Hunt's Merchants' Magazine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRAIRIEDOM. Prairiedom: Rambles and Scrambles in Texas or New Estremadura. With a Map. By a Southron. 1 vol., 12mo. Price 37½ cents, paper; 63 cents, cloth. “Light, sketchy and amusing; those who wish to get a glance at Texas cannot do better than to spend half an hour on this book.” —Protestant Churchman. “A splendid sketch of a rapid ride over Texas.” —Intelligencer. “It is light and vivacious; filled with incident; easy and flowing in style, and brilliant in imagery.” —Evening Mirror. “Thousands will read these graphic rambles with delight.” —Hunt's Magazine. “The volume is interspersed with a great many interesting and exciting incidents, which give a zest to the more important portions of the work.” — Rochester Democrat. “The delicate coloring of a fine fancy is thrown over objects and scenes which now possess a greater interest than ever, and which feeling of interest will be increased by reading these pages.” —N. Orleans Tropic.</field>
