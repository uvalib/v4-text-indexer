      <field name="fulltext">DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS, TO WIT: District Clerk's Office. Be it remembered, that on the fifteenth day of May, A. D. 1828, in the fifty-third year of the Independence of the United States of America, Samuel G. Goodrich, of the said district, has deposited in this office the title of a book, the right whereof he claims as proprietor, in the words following, to wit: `The Legendary, consisting of Original Pieces, principally illustrative of American History, Scenery, and Manners. Edited by N. P. Willis. Volume 1.' In conformity to the act of the Congress of the United States, entitled `An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned;' and also to an act, entitled `An act supplementary to an act, entitled, “An act for the encouragement of learning, by securing the copies of maps, charts, and books, to the authors and proprietors of such copies, during the times therein mentioned;” and extending the benefits thereof to the arts of designing, engraving, and etching historical and other prints.' JNO W. DAVIS, Clerk of the District of Massachusetts. EXAMINER PRESS. Hiram Tupper, Printer—Bromfield Lane.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The design of the Legendary has been made very generally known. There still exists, however, a degree of misunderstanding with regard to it, which induces us to repeat, here, that it is intended as a vehicle for detached passages of history, romance, and vivid description of scenery and manners, materials for which exist so abundantly in our country. As far as can be discovered, the plan has met universal approbation. After a series of unavoidable delays we are enabled to offer the first volume to the public. It is hoped that it will be found interesting. Some things have been admitted which are not exactly relevant to the design of the work. This is owing partly to misapprehension by contributors, and a consequent difficulty in procuring materials of the required description; but, more especially, to the failure of several distinguished writers, whose delinquencies we were obliged to supply at an advanced state of publication. We have received but little descriptive national poetry. This department is, consequently, almost wholly miscellaneous. We regret it the less, however, that it gives a variety to the work, the want of which might otherwise have been felt. The tale of `The Palisadoes' was, with the permission of the author, taken from a volume now in press, and it is hoped, that, though thus given in anticipation to the public, it will not diminish the interest in the forthcoming series. The article upon `Vermont' is merely introductory to some legends of that State, which will appear in future numbers. The irregularity of other resources must be the editor's apology for the frequent occurrence of his own productions. It will readily be seen that the difficulties attending the production of the first number of a work so entirely original, will hardly allow of its being a fair specimen. The highly respectable support promised, and a better understanding of our intentions will enable us to present our future numbers with a more specific character, and, we trust, with stronger claims upon the good opinion of the public. We should be pleased to receive well written articles illustrating the history, manners, and scenery of the West Indies, South America, and the Canadas; traditions of the Western and Southern States; and, for our poetical department, national ballads, descriptions of scenery, traditions in verse, and good poetry of every description. It is particularly requested that contributions for the second volume may be sent to the publisher within the month of June next. We wish also that all who contribute to the work would give us liberty to attach their names to their productions. We render a grateful acknowledgement to our friendly contributors, and hope for a repetition of their kind offices. With a single wish, that the national character of the Legendary may secure for it the candor and good feeling of its readers, we submit the first volume to the public. Editor. Boston, May 1, 1828.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE LEGENDARY. VOL. I. 1 THE CHURCH IN THE WILDERNESS. BY THE AUTHOR OF HOBOMOK. There stood the Indian hamlet, there the lake Spread its blue sheet, that flashed with many an oar, Where the brown otter plunged him from the brake, And the deer drank—as the light gale blew o'er, The twinkling maze-field rustled on the shore; And while that spot, so wild, and lone, and fair, A look of glad and innocent beauty wore, And peace was on the earth and in the air, The warrior lit the pile and bound his captive there. Not unavenged the foeman from the wood Beheld the deed, and when the midnight shade Was stillest, gorged his battle-axe with blood; All died—the wailing babe—the shrieking maid— And in the flood of fire, that scathed the glade, The roofs went down; but deep the silence grew, When on the dewy woods the day-beam played; No more the cabin smokes rose wreathed and blue, And ever by their lake, lay moored the light canoe. BRYANT. There is a solitary spot, in a remote part of Maine, known by the name of Indian Old Point. The landscape has no peculiar beauty, save the little sparkling river, which winds gracefully and silently among the verdant hills, as if deeply contented with its sandy bed; and fields of Indian corn, tossing their silken tresses to the winds, as if conscious of rural beauty. Yet there is a charm thrown around this neglected and almost unknown place, by its association with some interesting passages in our earliest history. The soil is fertilized by the blood of a murdered tribe. Even now the spade strikes against wampum belts, which once covered hearts as bold and true, as ever beat beneath a crusader's shield, and gaudy beads are found, which once ornamented bosoms throbbing with as deep and fervent tenderness, as woman ever displayed in the mild courtesies of civilized life. Here, one hundred years ago, stood the village of the Norridgewocks, one of the many tribes of the scattered Abnakis. These Indians have been less celebrated than many of their brethren; for they had not the fierce valor of the Pequods, the sinewy strength of the Delawares, or the bell-toned language of the Iroquois. They were, however, an influential nation; of consequence on account of their numbers, as well as their subtilty. The Jesuits, too, had long been among them, led by their zeal to fasten the strong girdle of an imposing faith around the habitable globe; and they had gained over the untutored minds of these savages, their usual mysterious and extraordinary power. The long continued state of effervescence, produced by the Reformation, tended to settle this country with rigid, restless, and ambitious spirits. Our broad lands were considered an ample tract of debatable ground, where the nations of the earth might struggle for disputed possession; and terrible indeed was the contest for religious supremacy between France and England, during the early part of the eighteenth century. Of the energy and perseverance displayed in this cause, there are few more striking examples than Sebastian Rallè, the apostle of the Norridgewocks. His rude, cross-crowned church, standing in the heart of the American wilderness, proved the ambition and extent of that tremendous hierarchy, `whose roots were in another world, and whose far stretching shadow awed our own.' Surrounded by the wigwams of the Abnakis, it seemed like an apostle of Antioch descended among savages, pointing out to them the heaven he had left. Our forefathers indeed thought it wore a different, and most unholy aspect; but to romantic minds, the Catholic church, even in its most degraded state, must ever be an object of interest. The majestic Latin, so lofty in its sound, and yet so soulless now to all save the learned, seems like the fragments of a mighty ruin, which Rome, in her decaying pride, scattered over the nations of the earth; and the innumerable ceremonies, more voiceless than the language in which they are preserved, forcibly remind one of the pomp and power rivalled only by attendant corruption. In this point of view only could the humble church of the Norridgewocks kindle the imagination; for it had little outward proportion, or inward splendor. It stood in a sheltered spot, between two small, verdant hills, with one graceful feathery elm at its side, bending forward, at every signal from the breeze, and half shading the cross, as if both bowed down in worship. Various opinions were formed of the priest, who there administered the rites of a mysterious religion. All agreed that he was a learned man; some said he was benevolent and kind; while others pronounced him the most subtle and vindictive of hypocrites. The English settlers, who resided about three miles from the village of the Abnakis, regarded him with extreme aversion; but to the Indians he was the representative of the Good Spirit. It is true the maxims of the Jesuits had given something of sternness and cunning to a character naturally mild and frank; but he verily thought he was doing God's service, and he did it with a concentration of power and purpose well worthy of the respect it inspired. For thirty years he lived in the wilderness, sharing the dangers and privations incident to savage life. The languages of all the neighbouring tribes were familiar to him; and his utterance could not have been distinguished from that of a native, had it not been for a peculiarly softened cadence, and rapid enunciation. A restless light in his small, hazel eye, and the close compression of his lips, betokened one, who had, with a strong hand, thrown up dykes against the overflowing torrent of his own mad passions. The effort had likewise turned back many a gentle current of affection, which might have soothed and refreshed his heart; but let man do his worst, there are moments when nature will rebound from all the restraints imposed on her by pride, prejudice, or superstition. There were two objects in the secluded residence of the self-denying Jesuit, on whom he poured forth in fulness the love he could not wholly stifle within him. When he came to America, he found among the savages the orphan son of the Baron de Castine, by a beautiful young Abnakis. The child was remarkably pretty and engaging; and the lonely priest, finding his heart daily warming toward him, induced the squaw who nursed him, to take up her abode in his own wigwam. The Indians called him Otoolpha, `The Son of the Stranger,' and seemed to regard the adopted one with quite as much interest as their own offspring. Not a year after Otoolpha and his nurse were domesticated in the dwelling of the Jesuit, some of the tribe, on their return from Canada, found a nearly famished female infant in the wood. Had not Sebastian Rallè 1* been of the party, its sufferings would, probably, have met a violent end; but at his suggestion, comfortable nourishment, and such care as they could give it were afforded. A nose slightly approaching to aquiline, and a complexion less darkly colored than usual, betrayed an origin half European; but as her parentage and tribe were unknown, they gave her the emphatic name of Saupoolah, `The Scattered Leaf,' and engrafted her on the tree of Abnakis. From the first dawn of reason she gave indications of an impetuous, fearless, and romantic spirit. The squaw who nursed her, together with the little Otoolpha, tried in vain to curb her roving propensities. At four and five years old, she would frequently be absent several days, accompanied by her foster brother. The duties of the missionary often called him far from home, and it was absolutely impossible for him always to watch over them, either in kindness, or authority. Their long excursions during his absence, at first occasioned many anxious and wretched thoughts; but when he found his wayward protégés invariably returned, and when he saw they could cross streams, leap ditches, and thread their way through the labyrinths of the wilderness, with the boldness and sagacity of young hunters, he ceased to disturb himself on their account. During the whole of their adventurous childhood but one accident ever happened to them. They had been at the English settlement to beg some beads in exchange for their little baskets, and on their return, they took a fancy to cross the Kennebec, when recent rains had swollen its deep and beautiful waters. Saupoolah's life nearly fell a sacrifice to the rapidity of the current; but her foster brother ran, with the speed of lightning, to call assistance from the village they had just left. A muscular, kind hearted woman, by the name of Allan, lived in a log-house, very near the river. In the midst of his terror, Otoolpha remembered this circumstance, and went there for succor. His frightened looks told his story, even more plainly than his hurried exclamation;—`Ogh! Saupoolah die'—the Great Spirit drink her up!' Mrs Allan saved the Indian child at the risk of her own life, dried her clothes, gave them something warm and comfortable to eat, and conducted them into their homeward path in safety. To this woman and her children Otoolpha and Saupoolah ever after clung with singular intensity of affection. During their childish summers, it was a daily occupation to fill baskets with berries for her little ones, whom they always chose to feed with their own hands, watching every morsel of the fruit as it disappeared between their rosy lips, with the most animated expressions of delight; and when they arrived at maturer years, they used the great influence they had with the tribe, to protect Mrs Allan from a thousand petty wrongs and insults, with which her white brethren were not unfrequently visited. Educated by the learned priest, as far as such fetterless souls could be educated, and associating only with savages, these extraordinary young people grew up with a strange mixture of European and aboriginal character. Both had the rapid, elastic tread of Indians; but the outlines of their tall, erect figures possessed something of the pliant gracefulness of France. When indignant, the expression of their eyes was like light from a burning-glass; but in softer moments, they had a melting glance, which belongs only to a civilized and voluptuous land. Saupoolah's hair, though remarkably soft and fine, had the jet black hue of the savage; Otoolpha's was brown, and when moistened by exercise, it sometimes curled slightly around his high, prominent forehead. The same mixture of nations was shown in their costume, as in their personal appearance. Otoolpha usually wore a brown cloth tunic, with tight sleeves, and large buttons, under which appeared a scarlet kilt falling to his knees, in heavy folds, edged with the fur of the silver fox, and fastened at the waist by a broad girdle, richly ornamented with Indian hieroglyphics. A coronet of scarlet dyed fur, to which were fastened four silver bells, gave indication of his noble descent; and from his neck were suspended a cross and rosary of sandal wood, which Sebastian Rallè declared to have been sanctified by the blessed touch of Innocent the Eleventh. Saupoolah's dress was nearly similar. Her tunic was deep yellow; and her scarlet kilt touched the fur edge of her high, closely fitted, and very gaudy moccasins. Her cap was not shaped unlike a bishop's mitre; gaily ornamented with shells and beadwork, and surmounted by the black feathers of three eagles her own arrow had slain. In the chase, she was as eager and keen eyed as Otoolpha. It was a noble sight to see them, equipped for the chase, bounding along through the forest. The healthful and rapid blood, coursing beneath their smooth, brown cheeks, gave a richness and vividness of beauty, which a fair, transparent complexion can never boast; and their motions had that graceful elasticity produced only by activity, unconsciousness, and freedom. Sebastian Rallè had been several years at Rome, in the service of the Pope, and had there acquired a refinement of taste uncommon at that early period. His adopted children sometimes accompanied him on his missionary expeditions to Canada and elsewhere, on which occasions the game they killed served for his support. When he saw them with their dark eyes fixed on a distant bird, arrows ready for flight, their majestic figures slightly bending backward, resting on one knee, with an advancing foot firmly fixed on the ground, displaying, by a natural bend of the limb, outlines most gracefully curved, he gazed upon them with uncontrolled delight; and he could not but acknowledge that the young savages, in their wild and careless beauty, rivalled the Apollos and woodnymphs to which classic imaginations had given birth. Such endowments are rare in Indian women; for the toils imposed upon them, usually weigh down the springs of the soul, till the body refuses to rebound at its feeble impulses; but when it does occur, it is the very perfection of ideal loveliness. Otoolpha would suffer no one to curb Saupoolah in her wildness and inspiration. To him and the Jesuit, she was docile and affectionate; to all others, haughty and impetuous. The Norridgewocks regarded them both with wonder and superstition, and frequently called them by a name, which signified the `Children of the Prophet.' The distant tribes, who frequently met them in their hunting excursions, were lost in admiration of their swiftness and majesty, and called them, by one consent, the `Twin Eagles of Abnakis.' Contemptuously as some think of our red brethren, genius was no rare endowment among them; and seldom have souls been so rich in the wealth of nature, as the two powerful and peculiar beings, whom we have described. Many were the bold and beautiful thoughts which rushed upon their untutored imaginations, as they roamed over a picturesque country, sleeping in clefts where panthers hid themselves, and scaling precipices from which they scared the screaming eagles. Perhaps cultivated intellect never received brighter thoughts from the holy rays of the evening star, or a stormier sense of grandeur from the cataract, than did these children of the wilderness. Their far leaping ideas, clothed in brief, poetic language, were perhaps more pleasant to the secluded priest, than frequent intercourse with his own learned, but crafty order. To him they were indeed as `diamonds in the desert;' and long and painful were the penances he inflicted upon himself, for an all-absorbing love, which his erring conscience deemed a sin against that God, who bestowed such pure, delicious feelings on his mysterious creatures. The Jesuit was deeply read in human nature, and it needed but little sagacity to foresee that Saupoolah would soon be to her brother `something than sister dearer.' When Otoolpha was but seventeen, and his companion not quite fifteen, their frank and childish affection had obviously assumed a different character. Restlessness when separated, and timidity and constraint when they met, betrayed their slavery to a new and despotic power. Sebastian Rallè observed it with joy. Early disappointment and voluntary vows had made the best and most luxurious emotions of our nature a sealed fountain within his own soul; but the old man had not forgotten youthful hopes and feelings, and for these beloved ones he coveted all earth had of happiness. They were married in presence of the whole tribe, with all the pomp and ceremony his limited means afforded. This event made no alteration in the household of the Jesuit. The old squaw, who had taken care of his adopted children from their infancy, performed all the services their half civilized way of life required, and the young hunters led the same wandering and fearless life as before. At the hour of sunset, it was the delight of the lonely priest to watch for their return, from a small opening, which served as a window to his study. It was a time he usually devoted to reflection and prayer; but the good man had virtues, which he called weaknesses and sins, and a spirit of devotion would not always remain with him at such seasons. The vine covered hills of France, his mother's kiss, and a bright, laughing girl, who had won his heart in early youth, would often rise before him with the distinctness of visions. The neglected rosary would fall from his hand, and love, as it first stole over a soul untainted by sensuality or selfishness, was the only heaven of which he dreamed. Such were the feelings with which he awaited the return of Otoolpha and Saupoolah, on the eleventh of December, 1719. Notwithstanding the lateness of the season, the day had been as mild as the first weeks of September. The drowsy sunshine dreaming on the hemlocks, pines, and cedars, had drawn forth an unusual fragrance; the children were at rest in the wigwams; most of the sanups had gone to Moose Head Lake, on a hunting expedition; and the few old men who remained, sat at the doors of their huts smoking their pipes in lazy silence. Wautoconomese, an aged prophet among them, declared this unnatural warmth to be a prelude of terrible things. He had gained his power of judging by a close observation of electrical phenomena and all the various changes of the weather, and it was no difficult matter to make his tribe mistake experience for inspiration. The women were all in alarm at his predictions; nor is it strange that the learned Jesuit, living as he did in a superstitious age, and believing doctrines highly calculated to excite the imagination, should be more affected by their terrors than he was willing to acknowledge, even to himself. These feelings naturally embodied themselves in anxiety concerning the two eccentric beings, whose presence was as morning sunshine in his dreary dwelling. The hour at which they usually returned, had long since passed; and strong and vigilant as he knew them to be, fearful thoughts of panthers and wolves crowded on his heart. Waking, he knew the fiercest prowlers of the wilderness would have shunned them; but they might have slept where loup-cerviers were in ambush, and roused too late for safety. While philosophy was struggling with these harassing ideas, and every moment growing weaker in the contest, he observed in the north a flash more brilliant than ever precedes the rising sun. For a moment it was stationary; then it moved, quivered, hurtled, and flashed, as if there had been `war in heaven,' and the clouds, rolling themselves up `as a scroll,' showed the gleaming of javelins, thrown thick and fast along the embattled line. All at once, a vivid stream of light from the south towered up, like Lucifer in his terrific greatness, and rushed onward with a mighty noise. The fiery forces, nearly meeting at the zenith, were separated only by a clear, deep spot of blue, surrounded by a few fleecy clouds. The effect was awful. It seemed as if the All-seeing Eye were looking down upon a sinful world, in mingled wrath and pity. The Catholic bowed his head, and his subdued spirit was mute in worship and fear. His solitude was soon interrupted by Wautoconomese, whose trembling agitation betrayed how little he had foreseen that his pompous prophecies would be thus sublimely fulfilled. Next the aged squaw, who, from fear of interrupting her master in his devotions, had long been crouching in her own corner of the wigwam, more dead than alive, came in, and reverentially crossing herself, implored permission to remain. To these were soon added an accession of almost all the women in the hamlet. Perhaps Sebastian Rallè was hardly aware how much the presence of these rude, uninformed beings relieved his spirit. His explanations to them, mixed with the consolations of religion, nerved his mind with new strength; and he began to look upon the awful appearance in the heavens with a calmness and rationality worthy of him. By degrees the light grew dim, then closed upon the speck of blue sky, which had appeared to keep watch over the souls of superstitious men, and the glorious scene seemed about to end. But suddenly a luminous bow shot from north to south with the rushing sound of a rocket, and divided the heavens with a broad belt of brightness. The phenomena of that night had been more extraordinary than any the Jesuit had ever witnessed; but until that moment he had known their name and nature; and, with that strange tendency to a belief in supernatural agency, which the greatest and wisest minds have, in a state of high excitement, his cheek now turned pale, and his heart dropped heavily within him, at what he deemed a sure presage of ruin to those he loved. Reason would have indeed told him that it did not comport with the economy of Providence to change the order of creation for so insignificant a thing as man; but who is not more under the influence of feeling than of reason? Unable to endure the terrific creations of his own fancy, he left the house, followed only by one of the tribe, and entered the path by which the young hunters usually returned. He pursued this route, for nearly a mile, without seeing any traces of the objects of his anxiety. At last, he heard a loud `Willoa.' The source of the clear, ringing sound could not be mistaken; for Saupoolah alone could give the shrillest tones of the human voice such depth and smoothness of melody. The Jesuit, by his long residence with the savages, had acquired their quickness of eye and ear, and a few moments brought him within view of his adopted child. She was standing in a thickly shaded part of the wood, her hand resting on her brow, looking backward, apparently listening with eagerness to the coming footsteps. A slight shade of disappointment passed over her face when she saw Otoolpha was not with her father; but it soon gave place to VOL. I. 2 an affectionate smile, at his enthusiastic demonstrations of joy. From her brief account it appeared they had early in the evening heard distressed noises apparently proceeding from a human voice; that they had separated in search of those from whom it came, and had thus lost each other. As she finished her story, another loud shout sent echoing through the forest, betrayed more anxiety than was common to her fearless nature. Yet even amid her doubt and perplexity, her romantic soul was open to the influence of the sublime scene above her. As they wound along through the forest, ever and anon shouting with their united voices, in hopes the echo would arouse Otoolpha, she occasionally fixed her eye on the bright arch, which still preserved its wavy radiance, though a little softened by light flashes of clouds, through which the stars were distinctly visible. `The arrows have been flying fast among the tribes of heaven to night,' said she. `The stars have chased their enemies over the hills. They are returning victorious; and the moon has spread her mantle in their war path.' When such thoughts as these came over her, Saupoolah's eyes had a brightness totally different from the keenness and outward brilliancy common to fine looking Indians; it was a light that came from within, gleaming up from fires deep, deep down in the soul. It was probably this peculiarity, which had so universally gained for her the title of `Daughter of a Prophet;' and its effect on the savage, who had attended the Jesuit, was instantly observable; for he devoutly crossed himself, and walked at a great distance from the object of his veneration. Sebastian Rallè, accustomed as he was to the wild freaks, and almost infantile tenderness of his adopted children, had often smiled at their power over the tribe; yet something of pride, almost of deference, mingled with his own love of them. Saupoolah's remark, and the look of inspiration, with which she fixed her eye on the heavens, awakened in his mind the remembrance of many a season, when he had listened to their wild eloquence with wonder and delight. This train of thought betrayed itself in an eagerly affectionate glance at Saupoolah, and a loud shout to Otoolpha, that made the woods ring again. The young wife suddenly assumed the Indian attitude of intense listening; and joy flushed her whole face, like a sunbeam, as she exclaimed, `It is answered!' Another shout! there could be no mistake. It could not be the reverberation of an echo, for it was repeated louder and louder, at irregular intervals. A rapid and devious walk, guided by sounds which evidently grew nearer, brought Otoolpha in sight. Quick as a young fawn, overflowing with life and frolic, Saupoolah bounded forward, and sprang upon his neck. But the eye of the Jesuit, always rapid and restless in its movements, quickly glanced from his new found treasure to the objects around. A European lady, possessed of much matronly beauty, lay lifeless at his feet; and a fragile looking boy, apparently eight or nine years old, was bending over her, and weeping bitterly. This child, alone in the wilderness with his dead mother, had uttered those cries of distress and terror, which had startled Otoolpha and his companion. The sight of a white man seemed to the desolate boy a pledge of safety. He nestled close to the side of the priest, and looking up in his face imploringly, burst into tears. The heart of the Jesuit was touched. There was something in the boy's voice and the lady's features, that troubled the waters of a long sealed fountain. The Indians exchanged whispers with that air of solemnity, which the presence of the dead always inspires. They read a mixed feeling of agony and doubt in the countenance of Sebastian Rallè, but they did not ask, and they never knew its origin. After a moment's silence, during which he seemed struggling with powerful emotion, he placed his hand gently on the boy's head, and spoke soothing words in French, which the child understood with perfect facility. No sigh, no outward sign of despair escaped him; but there was a marble stillness, which, like the ominous quiet of a volcano, betrayed that raging materials were at work within. He ordered the corpse to be borne to his wigwam with all possible gentleness; and when the unevenness of the path occasioned the least violence of motion, he would cringe, as if an adder had stung him. It was in vain that Wautoconomese and his frightened companion sought protection from him, on his return. Remarkable electrical appearances, in every variety of form, continued during the whole night; but the miserable man regarded them not. The lifeless mother was placed in his study, and he knelt down beside it with the boy, and spoke not a word. The old squaw brought in her tallest bayberry wax candles, and tried to prolong her stay in the room by a thousand little officious arts; but a gentle signal to withdraw was all she could gain from her heart stricken master. Day dawned, and found him unchanged in countenance or position. The boy, weary with grief and fatigue, had fallen asleep, and lay on the floor in a slumber as deep and peaceful as if unalloyed happiness had been his portion. The sight of his tranquil innocence, as the daylight shone upon his childish features, brought tears to the eyes of the rigid priest. It was a charm that broke the spell of agony which had bound down his spirit. The terribly cold and glassy look departed from him; but never, after that night, was Sebastian Rallè as he had been. Affliction did not soften and subdue him. It deepened the gloom with which he had long looked upon the world, and seemed to justify him in giving up his whole soul to the stern dictates of Jesuitical maxims. Even Otoolpha and Saupoolah met with occasional harshness; and William Ponsonby, the English boy, alone received uniform mildness and affection at his hands. He was a fair and delicate blossom; such a being as the heart would naturally cling to for its very fragility and dependence; but to none on earth, save Sebastian Rallè, was it known that there were other and deeper reasons for his peculiar tenderness. The lady, whom he had loved in early youth, had been induced by her parents to marry a wealthy Englishman, in preference to the unportioned Frenchman, whom alone she had truly loved. Her husband lost much of his fortune, and joined his countrymen against the French, during the troubled period between 1690 and 1762. He was taken by the Indians, and his wife saw him suffer a horrid and lingering death. By the humanity of one of the savages, she made her escape, with her youngest son, the only one remaining of eight fine boys. She well knew the residence of that devoted lover, whom her weakness of purpose had driven to a life of solitude and self-denial; and to him she resolved to appeal for protection. Worn out with wandering and privation, she died suddenly in the wilderness, when her arduous journey was well nigh completed; and the conscientious priest, even in the anguish of a breaking heart, felt that it was well for him she had died; for to have seen the widowed one depending upon him for protection, when the solemn vows of his order had separated them forever, would have been worse than death to endure. The affection he had borne the mother rested on the child; and in him he found, what he had in vain wished for since his residence in the New World, a docile and intelligent scholar. 2* The boy was indeed a sort of `young Edwin;' a sad, imaginative child, fond of his books, and still more fond of rambling far and wide with the wayward Saupoolah. The log-house of good Mrs Allan was the only place where William spoke in the language of his father; for English was a hateful sound to the ear of the Jesuit. The troubles between the neighbouring villages of English and Abnakis increased daily; and not a few of the latter were induced to revolt against their spiritual ruler. Distrust, jealousy, and weakness characterized all their councils. Their deep, but fluctuating feelings alternately showed themselves in insults to the priest, and acts of violence on their neighbours. Representatives were sent from the English villages on the Kennebec to the government at Boston, who protested against Sebastian Rallè, for constantly using his influence to excite Indian revenge to its utmost rancor; and letters filled with charges of this nature may still be seen in the records of the Historical Society. It is probable that they were, in some measure, well founded; for it was the dangerous creed of the Jesuits, that all human power, good or bad, should be made subservient to one grand end. Yet the Norridgewocks had so much reason to complain of the fraud and falsehood of the English, that it is difficult to decide to whom the greatest share of blame rightfully belongs. Be that as it may, affairs went from bad to worse. Mutual dislike became every day more inveterate; and Mrs Allan was the only one who had not in some way or other suffered from the powerful arm of the implacable Otoolpha. His French origin, the great influence he had over his tribe, and his entire submission to the will of the Jesuit, procured for him a double portion of hatred. Dislike was returned with all the fierceness and impetuosity of his savage nature; and English mothers often frightened their children into obedience by the use of his terrible name. In the autumn of 1724, these discontents were obviously approaching a fearful crisis. A Council Fire was kindled at the village of the Abnakis; and fierce indeed were the imprecations uttered, and terrible the resolutions taken against the English. Wautoconomese in his fury said, that the Evil Spirit had governed them ever since William Ponsonby came among them; and he demanded that the boy should at once be sacrificed to an offended Deity. The lip of the venerable priest quivered and turned pale for an instant; but it passed quickly, and so carefully had even the muscles of his face been trained in obedience to the Society of Jesus, that rigid indifference could alone be read there, as he carelessly asked, `Wherefore should the child die?' The fierce old prophet watched his emotions as the snake fixes her infernal eye on the bird she is charming unto death. `Because the Great Spirit, who dwells among the windy hills, and covers himself with the snow mantle, has whispered it in the ear of the wise man,' said he proudly. `Wherefore else did he breathe softly on the wood, for four sleeps, and take his garments from the sun, that it might give warmth to the pale papoose, on his way through the wilderness? I tell you, he sent him to Wautoconomese, that he might sacrifice him instead of the young fawn and the beaver; for he loves not the white face and the double tongue of the Yengees.' `And the love I bear them is such as the panther gives the stricken deer,' replied the Jesuit. `Ye are all one! ye are all one!' answered the raging prophet. `The Yengees say their king has counted more scalps than any other chief; and you say he is but a boy to the great king, who lives where the vines run with oil. Ye both have faces pale as a sick woman. One hisses like a snake, and the other chatters like a mad cat bird; but both hunt the poor Indian like a buffalo to his trap. Wautoconomese was once a very big prophet. The Great Spirit spoke to him loud, and his tribe opened their eyes wide, that they might look on him. What is Wautoconomese now? He speaks the words of the Great Spirit; and ye laugh when ye tell the young men of his tribe that his ears are old, and he cannot hear.' His stormy eloquence awakened the slumbering pride of his warlike nation; and against the whole race of white men they inwardly breathed a vow of extermination. The boy was bound for sacrifice, and evil eyes were cast upon the Jesuit. The ingratitude of those for whom he had toiled thirty long years, and the threatened loss of the dearest object which God had left to cheer his lonely pilgrimage, seemed to freeze the faculties of the old man; and that day would have ended his trials with his life, had not Otoolpha stepped into the centre of the Council Circle, and, with a low bow to Wautoconomese, demanded to be heard. He spoke reverently of the prophet; but, by all the sufferings and kindness of their French Father, he conjured them not to be ungrateful to him in his old age. He begged for the boy's life, and promised to lead his tribe to war against every white man, woman, and child, from Corratwick Falls to the Big Sea, if they would thus reward his victory. He was a favorite with his tribe, and they listened to him. After much consultation, they determined on midnight marches at the end of three weeks, by which means they intended to surprise and put to death all the English settlers on the Kennebec. If successful in this attempt, William Ponsonby was safe; if not, the innocent child must fall a victim to their savage hatred. Saupoolah slept little the night after she listened to the Council of her tribe. She thought of Mrs Allan's kind looks, when she saved her from drowning; and she remembered the happy hours when she used to feed the children from her little berry basket. Could she not save her from the general ruin? She asked Otoolpha if no stratagem could be devised. He told her it would lead to detection, and the life of William and the priest would be forfeited. In her uneasy slumbers she dreamed of the murder of her benefactress; and she started up, declaring she would save Mrs Allan's life at the peril of her own. Otoolpha resolutely and somewhat harshly forbade her to do it. It was the first time he had ever spoken to her in a tone of authority; and her proud spirit rose against him. `I have loved him,' thought she, `but not with the tameness of a household drudge; if such is the service he wants, let him leave Saupoolah, and find a mate among the slaves of Abnakis.' Her manner the next day was cold, suspicious, and constrained towards her husband. She said no more to him of her plans, but sought advice from the priest. The heart broken old man was roused into sudden energy, and solemnly and vehemently forbade her project. Saupoolah's soul struggled in cords to which she had been entirely unaccustomed. She was silent, but determined. That night she left Otoolpha in a sound sleep, and effected her dangerous purpose secretly. She told Mrs Allan all the plans of the Norridgewocks, beseeching her to make no other use of the knowledge, than to save herself and family. The terrified matron promised she would not. But could, or ought, such a promise to be kept? Time passed on, and threw no light on the dangerous deed Saupoolah had dared to perform. Fears of its consequences haunted her own soul, like a restless demon; and again and again did she extort from Mrs Allan a vow never to betray her. More than half of her fault sprang from a kind and generous nature; but she could not forgive herself for the vexation that had mingled with better feelings. Her pride and her buoyancy were both gone; and upon Otoolpha, Sebastian Rallè, and William Ponsonby, she lavished the most anxious fondness. The old priest cared little whether life or death were his portion; for he was old, and disappointment had ever been the shadow of his hopes. But for the dead mother's sake, his heart yearned for the life of the boy. Saupoolah, ever enthusiastic and self-sacrificing, promised to convey him away secretly, and place him under the protection of a Canadian priest. The time appointed was four days before the intended massacre of the English, when a Council Fire of one of the neighbouring tribes would induce most of the Norridgewocks to be absent. The night preceding his departure was a weary one to Sebastian Rallè. He spent it at William's couch in wakefulness and prayer. Affections, naturally intense, were all centered on this one object; and he had nerved himself to think that he must part with him, and then lay him down and die. The gray tints of morning rose upon him, showing the whole of his miserable little apartment in cheerless obscurity. The old priest, stern, philosophic, and rigid elsewhere, was in the seclusion of his own apartment, as wayward and affectionate as a child. He stooped down, and parting William's soft hair, imprinted a kiss on his forehead. The boy, half unconscious what he did, fondly nestled his cheek into the hand that rested on him. Sebastian Rallè looked upward with an expression that seemed to say, `O Father, would that this cup might pass from me.' Just then the church bell, with feeble but sweet tones, announced the hour of early mass. William was on his feet in an instant, and as quickly knelt to his venerable friend to receive his customary benediction. In a few minutes, every living soul in the hamlet was within the walls of the church. Wigwams were all quiet, and canoes were wimpling about in Sandy river. The savages had all bowed down and crossed themselves before the unseen God. The broken voice of the Jesuit was heard loudly beseeching, `Ora, ora pro nobis,' when armed men rushed in amid their peaceful worship. The clashing of swords, the groans of the dying, and the yells of the frantic, mingled in one horrid chaos of clamor. Not one escaped; not one. Some called out, `Save William Ponsonby and the priest!' Others aimed at the breast of the Jesuit, as if he had been the only victim desired. The English boy threw himself forward and received a stab, aimed at the heart of his old friend; and the priest, with one convulsive bound, and one loud shriek of agony, withdrew the sword and plunged it deeply in his own breast. Saupoolah's noble heart broke with intensity of suffering. She fell lifeless by the side of the murdered William, and a dozen swords at once were pointed at her. Otoolpha cast one hurried glance upon her; and man has no power to speak the mingled rage, despair, and anguish, which that wild glance expressed. With the concentrated strength of fifty savages, he forced his way unhurt to the river side, and sprung into Saupoolah's favorite canoe. The boat filled with water; and he found that even here the treacherous revenge of his enemies would reach his life. With desperate strength he gained the shore, and ran toward the forest. His coronet and belt made him a conspicuous victim; multitudes were in pursuit; and he died covered with wounds. * * * Before the setting of the sun, the pretty hamlet was reduced to ashes; and the Indians slept their last sleep beneath their own possessions. * * * For many years two white crosses marked the place where the Jesuit and his English boy were buried; but they have long since been removed. The white man's corn is nourished by the bones of the Abnakis; and the name of their tribe is well nigh forgotten. THE VALLEY OF SILENCE. BY WILLIAM CUTTER. It was a perfect Eden for beauty. The scent of flowers came up on the gale, the swift stream sparkled like a flow of diamonds in the sun, and a smile of soft light glistened on every leaf and blade, as they drank in the life-giving ray. Its significant loveliness was eloquent to the eye, and the heart; but a strange deep silence reigned over it all. So perfect was the unearthly hush, you could almost hear yourself think. KATAHDIN. Has thy foot ever trod that silent dell?— 'T is a place for the voiceless thought to swell, And the eloquent song to go up unspoken, Like the incense of flowers whose urns are broken; And the unvailed heart may look in and see, In that deep, strange silence, its motions free, And learn how the pure in spirit feel That unseen Presence to which they kneel. No sound goes up from the quivering trees, When they spread their arms to the welcome breeze. They wave in the zephyr, they bow to the blast, But they breathe not a word of the power that passed; And their leaves come down on the turf and the stream, With as noiseless a fall as the step of a dream; And the breath that is bending the grass and the flowers, Moves o'er them as lightly as evening hours. The merry bird lights down on that dell, And hushing his breath, lest the song should swell, Sits with folded wing, in the balmy shade, Like a musical thought in the soul unsaid; And they of strong pinion and loftier flight Pass over that valley, like clouds in the night— They move not a wing in that solemn sky, But sail in a reverent silence by. The deer in his flight has passed that way, And felt the deep spell's mysterious sway— He hears not the rush of the path he cleaves, Nor his bounding step on the trampled leaves. The hare goes up on that sunny hill— And the footsteps of morning are not more still. And the wild, and the fierce, and the mighty are there— Unheard in the hush of that slumbering air. The stream rolls down in that valley serene, Content in its beautiful flow to be seen; And its fresh, flowery banks and its pebbly bed Were never yet told of its fountainhead. And it still rushes on—but they ask not why; With its smile of light it is hurrying by; Still gliding or leaping, unwhispered, unsung, Like the flow of bright fancies it flashes along. VOL. I. 3 The wind sweeps by, and the leaves are stirred, But never a whisper or sigh is heard; And when its strong rush laid low the oak, Not a murmur the eloquent stillness broke; And the gay young echoes, those mockers that lie In the dark mountain sides, make no reply; But hushed in their caves, they are listening still For the songs of that valley to burst o'er the hill. I love society; I am o'erblest to hear The mingling voices of a world; mine ear Drinks in their music with a spiritual taste; I love companionship on life's gray waste, And might not live unheard;—yet that still vale— It had no fearful mystery in its tale— Its hush was grand, not awful—as if there The voice of nature were a breathing prayer. 'T was like a holy temple, where the pure Might join in their hushed worship, and be sure No sound of earth could come—a soul kept still, In faith's unanswering meekness, for Heaven's will— Its eloquent thoughts sent upward and abroad, But all its deep, hushed voices kept for God! THE WEDDING. I wish I ne'er had seen her eye, Ne'er seen her cheek of doubtful dye, And never, never dared to sip The sweets that hung upon the lip Of faithless Emma! SONG. At the little village of Stanton-Drew, in Somersetshire, and not far from the splendid city of Bath, there is a large circle of upright stones, each of which is from five to six feet high. The learned are of opinion that it is a Druidical monument or temple, and they are countenanced by the name of the village; but the rustics call it `The Wedding;' for tradition asserts that it is a bridal party, changed to stone. And I would give my humble voice on the side of the rustics and tradition. The story is as follows. There lived in this place, I cannot say precisely when, but many hundred years ago, a peasant girl by the name of Emma. She was the beauty of the village. Nature had lavished her gifts with such profusion on this lovely cottager, that it was impossible for the meanness of her attire, or the humility of her employments to conceal her from general notice and admiration—they could not hide the perfect symmetry of her form, nor the dazzling whiteness of her skin, nor the sparkling of her full black eyes. The carnation hue of health was on her cheeks, her step fell as light as the first snow of the year on the Mendip hills, and her heart was as free and as simple as childhood's. A youth of the same village first taught that heart the mystic lore of love. He was not unworthy of the feelings which he inspired. Edred as far surpassed the other youth of the neighbourhood as Emma did the maidens. In manly sports and exercises he bore away the prize of every competition, and the land which he tilled was the most productive of any for miles around. He was generous, open-hearted, and affectionate, and though fearless, he was gentle and kind. Beside all this, his desire of knowledge had led him to seek the acquaintance and instruction of the members of a neighbouring monastery, who encouraged his wishes, and taught him to read and write—accomplishments, which in those days were extremely rare, even among those who were much higher born than Edred. In the ardor of youth, and with the most lively sensibilities, it is not to be supposed that he alone should remain insensible to those charms which led captive every other heart— and as to Emma, she had too much discernment not to perceive his superior worth, and prefer him before all his rivals. Living near each other as they did, their opportunities of meeting were frequent, and they were improved. Preference ripened into love, and as they sat together one sweet moonlight evening under an old elm tree, which stood between the gardens of their parents, Edred poured out his vows at her feet, and Emma took Heaven to witness that she loved him alone, and loved him with her whole heart. From this moment they were hardly ever asunder. Day after day found them assisting each other in their daily labour, and night after night have the pale moonbeams, as they danced through the boughs of that old elm tree, been the only witnesses of their innocent and happy interviews. It was soon known throughout the village that their mutual faith was plighted. Their parents, far from being averse to the union, were overjoyed at it; as to both parties it was a most desirable one, and it was settled between them that the marriage day should not be distant. But it would seem as if such happiness was too great to be durable, for the blighting of all this promise was at hand. A rich baron came to live in the neighbourhood. He saw Emma, and was enamoured. She perceived it, and avoided him. He was not however to be so discouraged; but, finding it impossible to obtain a hearing from the maid, he applied to her parents. He told them of his rank, his riches, his lands; protested that his views were honorable; and painted in glowing colors the advantages which would arise to them from their daughter's becoming the mistress of all his wealth and splendor. What could the simple people do? They were dazzled, they were overcome, and promised this titled suitor that they would use all their influence with their daughter in advancing his cause. They did so; they beset the poor girl, night and day; the mother intreated and wept, and the father commanded and frowned; and a sister too, whom she dearly loved, hung upon her neck, and kissed her, and clasped on her arms and braided in her hair the rich jewels which the baron had sent her, and begged her to be a baron's bride. Wearied, terrified, and melted by importunity, menace, and tears, and tempted too, it must be acknowledged, by the prospect of such an alliance as was held out to her, she at last consented to receive the baron as a lover—consented that all her engagements with Edred should be dissolved—consented to break her oaths, her vows, her faith, and Edred's heart. But where was Edred all this while? If he had been in the village, indeed, he might have saved his mistress from the guilt, and himself from the misery, of such a 3* change. But necessity had called him to a distant part of the country, and he returned unconscious of all that had taken place in his absence, and unprepared for the storm that awaited his coming. He was not long kept in ignorance, for the story was in the mouth of every stripling in the village; and his eager eye had just caught a glimpse of the blue smoke which curled above the trees, and pointed out Emma's dwelling, when from a shepherd boy who was tending his flock on the hills, he heard it all. In a state little short of distraction, he flew to the door which always used to be thrown open before he reached it—and it was now shut against him —he was told that the great man was there, and that he must not come in. He heard no more, but swooned on the threshold, and was borne away senseless to the cottage of his parents. As Emma, ignorant of Edred's return, was sitting on the following night at her window, after every one beside had gone to rest—for, torn by a thousand conflicting thoughts, she slept but little now—she saw something approaching the cottage, and shortly after heard a noise at the door. Trembling with an emotion for which she knew not how to account, she went down and opened it. The visitor was Edred's favorite dog, who dropt a packet at her feet, and, without waiting, as usual, to be caressed, disappeared. His master was then in the village—it could not be doubted—for the same faithful messenger had often been employed in happier days, to convey the letters which her first lover had taught her to read. Though ready to sink on the floor, she summoned all her strength, and sustained herself to her chamber, where, breaking the string which bound the packet, she read the following lines. `I thought you loved me, Emma—fondly thought you loved me—it was a dear delusion, but it is over now—a heavenly dream, but it has fled forever, and left me to the reality of wretchedness and despair. Would I could sleep again, and never waken! Is all that has past between us forgotten then? our blissful interviews, our plighted faith, our vowed affections, are they all forgotten? It is not, sure, so long since we parted, that every endearing recollection should thus have passed away. Why, it seems to me that the last kiss you gave me is yet warm on my cheek, and the last blessing you murmured is yet breathing its music to my ear. And now you do not know me—you will not see me—you turn me from your door; the heart that I once thought mine proves strange and cold, and the hand, that in the sight of men and angels was mine, you have given, you have sold, to another. And do you think that that other will love you with a love like mine, with a faith, a truth, a devotion like mine? He has towers, and halls, and vassals, and heaps of treasure; but what are these to love? He may boast of his long, unbroken line of ancestry, but can he tell you of an undivided heart? He may give you rank in the land, and clothe you with jewels, and surround you with slaves—but will he make your image his bosom's queen, to reign there supremely and alone? will he unlock to you the treasures of all his secret thoughts, and all his best and fondest affections? will he devote to you the service of his own exertions, his entire solicitude, his earnest cares, his very dreams? But I would, Emma—and I tell you now, that the time may come, when in all the glare of his lighted chambers, and amid crowds of his gay retainers, you will feel alone; and though the harps and the cymbals are ringing, and the songs of minstrels are loud, you will not hear them; and though the masquers and dancers are passing and repassing before your eyes, you will not see them; and the torches may blaze, and the revel wax high—yet you will heed nothing and mark nothing— for your soul will not be there—it will be wandering on the cool river bank, in the moon's pale light, or the grove's deep shade; it will visit the green lane, and the lowly cottage, and mayhap the poor peasant, who lived, and would have died for you. Forgive me, Emma, if I distress you; I still love, shall ever love you, and though you have made life as nothing to me, I hope, but can only hope, that it will be full of blessing for you. I have done with its pursuits and pleasures, and no longer acknowledge its relations. I shall retire to the monstery whose turrets you see rising from the valley, and spend the sad remnant of my days in prayer. Before the throne of Heaven, you will never be forgotten; in the silent cell your form will be constantly before me; in the early matin song, and the sweet vesper hymn, and the solemn midnight vigil, your dear name will rise unbidden to my lips, and be cherished in the holiest devotions of my heart. Farewell, farewell!' Emma was far from being insensible, and the shock occasioned by this letter threw her into a violent fever, in the delirium of which she was constantly raving of Edred. As she gradually recovered, however, her feelings of compunction and remorse became less poignant, and she again received the visits of the baron with composure. He, on his part, fearing some other untoward accident, urged their immediate nuptials. Everything was prepared, and as soon as Emma was able to leave her chamber she was conducted, or rather conveyed, by her successful lover, her parents, and her sister, to the village church, where their arrival was expected by one of the neighbouring monks, who had been previously engaged to perform the ceremony. As the marriage was to be strictly private, in order to shun the observation of the villagers, who were highly incensed at the parties, the evening was chosen for the time of its solemnization; and the recesses of the church were already wrapped in gloom, and a faint light scarce struggled through the painted windows, as the party advanced up the aisle, and drew around the altar. The monk opened his ritual, and in a hurried voice began to read the service. He had proceeded but a few lines, when a deeper shade suddenly pervaded the church, and these words were distinctly heard,—`The banns are forbidden!'—`Ha! by whom' cried the terrified ecclesiastic. `By Heaven and earth; by God and man!' answered the unearthly voice. `Nay, then, I cannot—' `Go on!' thundered the angry baron, `go on, I say, stupid, cowardly dotard, and mind not the shallow trick of some vile clown, who shall dearly rue this interruption, as thou shalt too, sir fool, if thou dost not despatch.' Thus threatened, the intimidated monk resumed the service, and came to that part of it in which he asked the baron, in the prescribed form, if he would have Emma for his wedded wife. `I will,' was the prompt reply. Turning then to Emma, he asked her if she would have the baron for her wedded husband. She spoke not, and stirred not, and the sharp, short echo of the vaulted roof returned, as if in mockery, the last word of his question—and all was silent again. `Art thou possessed, maiden, that thou respondest not to the holy words?' said the monk, in a tone in which fear, vexation, and impatience were blended—`what is in thee, that thou canst not pronounce two simple syllables? and here, the while, it has grown so dark, the saints of Heaven preserve us! that I can hardly see to read this holy sacrament of matrimony; and much I fear that I shall not reach our refectory in due season, for methinks the hour of supper must be already past, and this place feels strangely cold, wherefore I pray thee, maiden—' But here he seemed to have lost on a sudden all power of utterance, and his discourse was cut off in the midst. Emma's sister, surprised at her persevering silence, and indeed the silence, and unmoving features of the whole company, left her place, ran up to her, and laying her hand gently on her shoulder, `My sister, my dearest Emma!' she began—`but, gracious Virgin! what is this? how deadly cold you are! as cold—as cold—' she could say no more, but sunk down lifeless on the pavement of the chancel. The morrow was Sunday; and as the villagers assembled in the church, a strange and awful vision met their bewildered eyes—a regular assemblage of upright stones, occupying the holiest place, and throwing their long, still shadows over the aisles, as the morning sun glanced through the eastern window. It was attempted to remove them, but they yielded not in the least to the utmost efforts which could be employed. The brethren of the monastery were summoned; who, informed of the prodigy, approached the church in long procession, bearing lighted waxen tapers, and chanting hymns and burning incense. As they ranged themselves before the altar, the abbot pronounced a solemn incantation, while his companions flung holy water on the charmed stones; but it was all without effect—sacred spell and human strength were alike unavailing, and the solid masses remained unmoved. The church was deserted; no one would worship in it, for they said that it was God-forsaken. It gradually went to decay, its roof and walls fell in, and the materials were dispersed; but still those mysterious stones stood up, unhurt and unshaken. Of the church there is not now a vestige to be discovered; but those same stones are here, and here they will stay till the day of doom. This short thick stone, standing alone in the midst of the others, is the venal monk. That tall one opposite him is the bridegroom. These are the parents of the bride. This one, lying prostrate on the ground, is her sister. And that slender one, next to her, is the bride herself, the fair, but faithless Emma. Do you see the flat blue stone, hard by in that hollow, half hidden by the long grass and the bending hyacinth? It covers the grave of brother Lawrence, who intreated to be buried in this spot. They say that it is only around this stone that the grass and the wildflowers will grow; and it is also said, that brother Lawrence and the peasant Edred were the same. I was told, that the following custom had prevailed among the swains of Stanton-Drew, from that time to the present, and that it had been attended with the best effects. When any one of them has reason to suspect that the allurements of wealth or station may seduce from him the affections of his mistress, he leads her to this enchanted circle, and repeats to her the tradition of THE WEDDING. THE EXILE AT REST. BY THE REV. JOHN PIERPONT. His falchion flashed along the Nile; His hosts he led through Alpine snows; O'er Moscow's towers, that blazed the while, His eagle flag unrolled—and froze. Here sleeps he now, alone!—not one Of all the kings whose crowns he gave, Bends o'er his dust;—nor wife nor son Has ever seen or sought his grave. Behind this sea-girt rock, the star That led him on from crown to crown Has sunk;—and nations from afar Gazed as it faded and went down. High is his couch;—the ocean flood Far, far below, by storms is curled; As round him heaved, while high he stood, A stormy and unstable world. Alone he sleeps! the mountain cloud, That Night hangs round him, and the breath Of morning scatters, is the shroud That wraps the conqueror's clay in death. Pause here! The far off world at last Breathes free;—the hand that shook its thrones, And to the earth its mitres cast, Lies powerless now beneath these stones. Hark! comes there, from the pyramids, And from Siberian wastes of snow, And Europe's hills, a voice that bids The world he awed to mourn him?—No: The only, the perpetual dirge That's heard here, is the sea-bird's cry— The mournful murmur of the surge— The cloud's deep voice—the wind's low sigh. UNWRITTEN POETRY. BY N. P. WILLIS. — For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes, The still, sad music of humanity, Not harsh, nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean, and the living air, And the blue sky— WORDSWORTH. There is poetry that is not written. It is living in the hearts of many to whom rhyme is a mystery. As I here use it, it is delicate perception; something which is in the nature, enabling one man to detect harmony, VOL. I. 4 and know forms of beauty better than another. It is like a peculiar gift of vision; not creating a new world, but making the world we live in more visible; enabling us to combine and separate and arrange elements of beauty into the fair proportions of a picture. The poet hears music in common sounds, and sees loveliness by the wayside. There is not a change in the sky, nor a noise of the water, nor a sweet human voice, which does not bring him pleasure. He sees all the light and hears all the music about him—and this is poetry. To one thus gifted, nature is a friend of many sweet offices and true consolations. Call it visionary if you will, she has glad fellowship for the happy, and medicine for the wounded spirit, and calm communion for gentle thoughts, which are the life of his moral being. Let him seek her when he will, if his heart be anything but dead, the poor sympathy of the world is a mockery to her ministering influences. I dare go farther. The power of nature over such a mind as I have described, is, in cases of extreme mental suffering, or abandonment, stronger than any other moral influence.[1] [1] I except religion of course; and I would be understood throughout this narrative as having no reference, comparative or direct, to that purest of all principles. My object is to illustrate the effect of nature on rare and imaginative minds, and not to state a theory of any general bearing whatever. There is something in its deep and serene beauty, inexpressibly soothing to the diseased mind. It steals over it silently, and gradually, like an invisible finger, erasing its dark lines and removing its brooding shadows, and before he is aware, he is loving, and enjoying, and feeling, as he did in better days when his spirit was untroubled. To those who see nothing about them but physical convenience, these assertions may seem extravagant; but they are nevertheless true; and blessed be the Author of our faculties, there are some who know, by experience, that nature is a friend and a physician to the sick and solitary spirit of her worshipper. Paul Lorraine, by the above definition, was a poet. He had been what is called a strange child. It was a way of saying that they did not understand him. His unbounded gladness when gay, and his singular depression at times, were unaccountable. He was as docile and affectionate as a girl; but he would wander away on a summer morning and neglect his books like a very truant. He never could resist the stirrings of spring, and the smallest bird that went singing over him on his way to school, tempted him off irresistibly. His spirit revolted at confinement in such seasons, and when chid for absence, his spirit rose within him and he answered indignantly. On one of these occasions he was punished with a blow. I remember it as if it were yesterday. He was perfectly transformed. The delicate, quiet boy whom we expected to submit, and weep, sprang to his feet with the sternness of a lion. He compressed his beautiful lip, and his eye flashed for a moment—and then he stood calm and immoveable till the blood gushed from his nostrils. It was the last attempt to subdue him, and he was left to his own waywardness. At fourteen Paul Lorraine was the most engaging being I ever saw. He was tall for his years, and surpassingly graceful; but his face won you like a spell. It was not its regularity; not its clear, transparent complexion; not his fine eye, with its long, shadowy lashes; but a delicious melancholy that was refreshing, like the twilight, to look upon. He was happier than most boys; often gay; but whatever the expression of the moment, and whatever the change in features that were singularly flexible, the calm, angelic seriousness of that look was always there. His person was apparently slight; but exquisite symmetry, and the exercise of his early wanderings, had given it compactness, and the airy glide of his step was almost unearthly. His bearing was modest, and the habitual sadness of his countenance chastened it much; but no one could be long in his presence, without discovering that the chivalry of a highminded boy was among his readiest impulses. Is it singular that such a being should be loved? that in the early maturity of uncommon sensibilities, he should himself love, passionately? Perhaps it was the fault of his character that he was too susceptible. He certainly never could resist the delightful language of a woman's unmeant preference; and if this is a sin, it is the shadow of a virtue—a consequence inseparable from the very delicacy which ennobled him. I am not sure that the blush which betrayed the secret of Marion Graham, was not the first shot from the quiver we read of; but be that as it may, a truer affection never stirred the fine chords of the human bosom than the love of Paul Lorraine for that bewitching fairy. I have seen her often. I have played with her, by daylight, and moonlight, a thousand times; and I could describe her; but he has done it himself, better. He wrote the verses which follow in school, on a blank leaf of his Virgil: The tempting lip I never kissed, Or kissing, may not tell, Was like a flashing amethyst On which a tear has fell, Or rose leaves blushing through a mist, Or the tinting of a shell. I gazed upon that lip the while Her honied words did flow, And wondered at the hidden wile That made my feelings glow, And wished my sister could beguile My weary spirit so. Her eye was bluer than the sky, And holier by far; And now was flashing vividly, Now tranquil as a star; And her lashes were bent droopingly, As the Madonna's are. The carpet scarcely took a print Of her elastic foot, And every step had meaning in't, Like moving to a lute, And fell like snow upon a flint— As traceless and as mute. She was a woman, and a child; Capricious and mature; At time the wildest of the wild, Then saintly and demure. The silver moon was not as mild, Nor her silver light as pure. I loved her like a fervent boy, Too well to eat or sleep; And I grew serious of joy, Till I could almost weep; And feared my visits would annoy, And asked a curl to keep. 4* That pleasant eve! That moonlight eve! The honeysuckle low! The trellis bars that seemed to weave The light and shadow so! And the half blown rose that made her grieve, That it should ever blow!— It seemed the beauty of a spell, And she the spirit fair; I never loved the eve so well, Or breathed such balmy air; And Marion—but I must not tell The things that happened there. At twentyfive, Paul had mingled with the world. He had been caressed more than was good for his character, and had dipped deeper into pleasure than his better angel whispered him was innocent. He had learned to wear armor upon his feelings, and could go free among companions whose want of delicacy and consideration would have wounded him, once, like arrows. He had become what is called a man of the world, of the better order; such an one as women select for a defender, and men for an umpire in the nice distinctions of honor. He was to a certain degree, master of himself, and always a ruling spirit with others; a noble nature, that had suffered plausible, but false principles to graft themselves upon it. His worldly accomplishments, however, were as yet but the dress of the masquerader, and his heart was beating still, beneath it, with the fine impulses that wrought upon his boyhood. He had kept the poetry of his feelings apart from their profanation; and in the midst of gaiety, it would visit him like a palpable touch, and lead him away in a rich dream to the beautiful treasures of his fancy. A reach of moonlight on a wall, or a glimpse of a bright star through the window of a ballroom, was talisman enough; and the contemplations of his early years would come at such bidding, and refresh him in the depth of a forgetfulness that would seem to be total. How often have I followed him from a crowded room, to see him lean over a balustrade, and with the merry laugh of `fair women and brave men' ringing in his ear, look up to the clear heavens with the enthusiastic and simple fervor of a child! To Marion he was true. She had grown up as he knew she must, with a heart too deep, and a mind too ardent for the light frame which imprisoned them. She was as delicate as a flower; but oh! her love was the breath of her being, that would one day exhaust it. She had the quick perceptions of her sex, united to the strong, intuitive capacities of genius. Her acquirements had elevated and expanded them; and without a knowledge of the world, or the trick of fashion, she stood alone among women like a `particular star,' and won from all the unqualified admiration she did not value. The love that Paul had begun with a boy's rash vow, was matured into a strong affection. It was the whole tide of his aim in life to be worthy of Marion. There were obstacles in the way of his happiness, however, which, in the opinion of his friends, made the attainment difficult, if not improbable. He was not rich, and had no apparent preference for any profession or business. While this was the case, a connexion was, of course, by the principles of this `working day world,' not to be thought of; and the fear on this subject, by those who knew the temper of his mind, was formidable. It had been, however, a theme of much reflection to him, and the subject, in his own feelings, wore a brighter aspect. His views, it is certain, were yet romantic, and he did not quite realize the dull servitude of business; but he had naturally a penetration and common sense, which were singular in a mind so gracefully gifted, and the sweet vision of Marion Graham, was, in his own view, a sufficient stimulus to all necessary sacrifice. Society, however, had many claims upon him, and with the irresistible fascination of his manner, it was not strange that he became a favorite. It is a trying relation to hold to the world, and true as it certainly was that he was not as deliriously devoted to its pleasures as those with whom he mingled, appearances often warranted remark, which heavily clouded the hopes of Marion. If his character had been better understood, she would have been spared the trial; but the air which he put on like a mantle, was to ordinary men the acquisition of half a life; and the hours he gave to society, and which were, to him, a relief from books, were to ordinary men dissipation, unfitting them for all serious employment. Who should know that the overflow of his spirit was more than their whole capacity? Who should know that the rich beauty of his language, and the authentic elegance of his address, were the original of their studied imitation? It was here that the candid, and the lenient, misunderstood, and misrepresented him. They believed upon common principles, and spoke with the persuasion of truth, and it required all the philosophy of Marion, not to tremble at the asserted tendency of his career. Lorraine was otherwise mistaken, and the result became the fever of her spirit. I have said that he was susceptible. He never ceased to love her. There was never a moment when he would not have preferred her immeasurably to a world of his reputed idols. But away from her sweet voice, and under the bewildering influence of music and excitement, he would be tempted into a momentary homage which was repeated to her with the coloring of scandal, till her heart was sick. It was not that she believed them. She knew in her clear judgment that his devoted manner was misconstrued, and his native ardor too far above the level of his fellows to be attributed to ordinary feeling; but the continual dropping which wears away a stone is a true emblem of the unquiet heart, and she wore away beneath it. Unavoidable circumstances kept him at a distance, and they seldom met. But with all the hallowed delicacy and deep tenderness of their love, that brief intercourse was constrained and painful. It was natural that it should be so. Her cheek glowed in his presence like the lip of a child; but a less practised eye might discover the history of sad, weary thought beneath it. He knew its intensity; and it was not strange, as she leaned feebly on his arm, that dark thoughts overshadowed his happiness. Could she be happy? This `wearing away to the land of the leal' is not the stealthy ministry they call it. It tells truly of its progress. And it is only when the shortened pulse and the difficult breath are wilfully disregarded, that the last call is a surprise to the sufferer. Could she be happy? She looked upon his noble forehead, and his manly beauty, and asked herself if the siren world would pass him by with its manifold temptations. It was no weakness of her trust. But the bias of elements so warm, and the workings of a spirit so unlike the tame temper of his fellows, might surely warrant anxiety in one who waited on their destiny. She remembered that the minute, and, to him, almost contemptible policy of life must be adopted; that his fine powers must be condensed and turned to profit; that he must forget his beautiful fancy, and forsake the attractions of frequented circles, and be no more alone with nature; that he must meet fraud, and calculation, and be patient with absurdity, and familiar with the low artifice of the shrewd; that he must change, totally; and for what? Riches! And would he do it? Yes, Marion! To fold you to his bosom, to take you to himself; shelter, protect, cherish you, were enough to bear him on, were it ten times the sacrifice. I have often thought that the fine spirits who are sometimes seen among us, were commissioned angels, gifted with bodies that should release them gently when their errand was done. It is to me almost a conviction. The frames of the very purest human beings whom it is our blessedness to know, are often so delicately balanced; they seem so readily and lightly to depart when the brightness of their life is overcast; to live so entirely to bless, and to die so truly at the hour when the sorrow of the world would overtake them, that I cannot think it a dream. Marion Graham was such an one. The fragile beauty of her form was more the delicacy of an ephemeron than the proper symmetry of a creature that would endure. It was evident in her childhood that the first shock given to her spirit would disengage it; and though many wept, none wondered when she visibly failed and assumed the treacherous loveliness of consumption. The anxieties of which I have spoken, and the constant fervor of a love which kept her heart feverish with excitement, were too much, and it was apparent that she was going down rapidly to the grave. It was not kept from Lorraine, and he was prostrated with the blow. He had feared and expected it long; but it came upon him with the suddenness of a thunderbolt. The human heart is a subtle deceiver, and never believes till truth is inevitable; and that Marion would die—so soon! before he had pressed her to his heart, and called her his own, had, even to his darkest forebodings, seemed impossible. I cannot describe his feelings. He could not, adequately, himself. He was not permitted to go to her while a shadow of a hope remained, and he sunk into a stupor which seemed almost the calmness of delirium. I went to him one day, and found him more cheerful than usual. He had been writing the verses copied below, and it had relieved him. He handed them to me with a melancholy smile, and said they were his last poetry. Is death so near thee, Marion? Is it the time for thee To lay thy burden gently down, And let thy spirit free? And is this all thy ministry? Is thy brief errand done? Art thou so early for the grave, Sweet Marion? I cannot give thee up—to die! I cannot feel that thou Wilt lift no more that gentle eye, Nor come with that sweet brow! How could I—seeing not thy face, And hearing not thy tone— Bear my impatient heartedness, And still live on! It is not yet! But sickness lies Heavily at thy heart, And dimness presseth down thine eyes, Till thou wouldst fain depart; And Oh! I may not bathe thy brow, Nor at thy pillow pray, Nor wait to close thy lids, when thou Hast past away! But fare thee well! If it must be— If thou must falter—die! I care not if it be my lot Beside thee soon to lie— The early vow will not be broke, Thy early beauty won, When low together we shall sleep— Dear Marion! A few weeks elapsed, and Lorraine looked hourly for a summons to her death bed. It came, and he obeyed it with a sick heart and a wasted frame. The right of affection is acknowledged at such an hour, and he was led to her room immediately on his arrival. —Could that be Marion? She, who lay before him with that radiant smile, was that the suffering, exhausted, dying Marion he looked to see? He gazed a moment on her face, and passed his hand over his eyes as if to know that it was not a dream; then going up to the bedside, he bent slowly and solemnly over her, and kissed her delicate lips as if the breath of an angel had made them holy. He was unprepared for a scene so different from his conceptions of death. She was so calm, so serene, so lovely in a decay that seems to anticipate the excellent beauty of heaven; her eye was so unnaturally bright, and her illumined features so like the `shining faces' of inspired description, that he was awed as by the presence of a spirit. She closed her eyes, and was visibly agitated for a few minutes; then, in a clear, sweet voice, she called him and he again leant over her. She spoke of her love; her former unkind fears, and present trust in his affection; of her hope in God, and her desire that he should seek Him earnestly; and requesting that he would once more press his lips to hers, became insensible. Presently she revived—shivered slightly—and, looking up to his face with the smile of a seraph—died! Spring, beautiful spring, with its delicious breath, and its new leaves, and its gladness for every living thing and creature under heaven, had come on, and with the perfection of its last, lagging foliage we began our wanderings. Lorraine was still an invalid, but better than we had dared to hope. Sickness had dealt severely with him the past winter, and a depression which he could not shake off, chequered with occasional delirium, threatened the total overthrow of his reason. He had so far recovered now as to bear the fatigue of travelling, and we trusted much to the sweet influences of the season for a restoration of both body and mind. We turned westward, and in a few days entered the valley of the Mohawk. I could write a book upon its sunsets, and the exquisite beauty of its banks and waters, but I must pass it without description. We loitered long and pleasantly upon its graceful windings, and though it won no smile or evidence of exhilaration from Lorraine, I could see that he was interested, and VOL. I. 5 now and then beguiled of his dark thoughts, and I hailed it as a promise of better things. On one of the balmiest mornings that ever broke, we descended the rude steps leading to the bed of the Trenton Falls. For some days I had perceived no change in Lorraine, and I began to fear, that the appearances upon which I had built my hopes, were but the effect of physical excitement, and that his diseased mind was beyond the skill of nature. We reached the bottom, and stood upon the broad, solid floor, a hundred feet down in the very heart of the rock, and in my first feeling of astonishment, even my interest in his impressions was forgotten; but its sublime grandeur had awakened him, and when I recovered my self-possession, he stood with his hands clasped, and his fine face glowing with surprise and pleasure. His figure had assumed the erect, airy freedom for which he was once remarkable, and as we went on, the alacrity of his step was delightful. In a few minutes we stood below the first fall. The whole volume of the river here descends fifty feet at a single leap. The basin which receives it is worn into a deep, circular abyss, and the dizzy whirl and tumult of the water is almost overpowering. We ascended at the side, and at a level with the top of the fall, passed under an immense shelf, overshadowing us almost at the height of a cloud, and advancing a little further, the whole grand sweep of the river was before us. It was a scene of which I had never before any conception, and I confess myself inadequate to describe it. To stand in the bed of a torrent, which flows for miles through a solid rock, at more than a hundred feet below the surface; to look up this tremendous gorge, and see, as far as the eye can stretch, a river rushing on with amazing velocity, leaping at every few rods over a fall, and sinking into whirlpools, and sweeping round projecting rocks constantly and violently; to see this, and then look up as if from the depths of the earth to the giant walls that confine it, piled apparently to the very sky, this is a sensation to which no language that would not seem ridiculous hyperbole could do justice. When the first surprise is over, and the mind has become familiar in a degree with the majestic scope of the whole, there is something delightfully tranquillizing in its individual features. We spent the whole day in loitering idly up the stream, stopping at every fall, and every wild sweep of the narrow passes, and resting by the side of every gentle declivity where the water shot smoothly down with a surface as polished as if its arrowy velocity were the sleep of a transparent fountain. There is nothing more beautiful than water. Look at it when you will—in any of its thousand forms—in motion or at rest—dripping from the moss of a spring, or leaping in the thunder of a cataract—it has always the same wonderful, surpassing beauty. Its clear transparency, the grace of its every possible motion, the brilliant sheen of its foam, and its majestic march in the flood, are matched unitedly by no other element. Who has not `blessed it unaware?' If objects that meet the eye have any effect upon our happiness, water is among the first of human blessings. It is the gladdest thing under heaven. The inspired writers use it constantly as an image for gladness, and `chrystal waters' is the beautiful type of the Apocalypse for the joy of the New Jerusalem. I bless God for its daily usefulness; but it is because it is an every day blessing, that its splendor is unnoticed. Take a child to it, and he claps his little hands with delight; and present it to any one in a new form, and his senses are bewildered. The man of warm imagination, who looks for the first time on Niagara, feels an impulse to leap in, which is almost irresistible. What is it but a delirious fascination—the same spell which, in the loveliness of a woman, or the glory of a sunset cloud, draws you to the one, and makes you long for the golden wings of the other? I trust I shall be forgiven for this digression. It is one of feeling. I have loved the water from my childhood. It has cheated me of my sorrow when a homesick boy, and I have laid beside it in the summer days when an idle student, and deliciously forgot my dry philosophy. It has always the same pure flow, and the same low music, and is always ready to bear away your thoughts upon its bosom, like the Hindoo's barque of flowers, to an imaginative heaven. I had not troubled Lorraine with conversation. I thought it better to leave him to his own thoughts and the sweet influences about him. It seemed to accord with his feelings, and in the whole day's wanderings he had scarcely spoken. Late in the afternoon we retraced our steps, and as reascended from the glen, and threaded the green path homeward, the golden light of the sunset streamed into the wood, touching the tassels of the pine, and the stooping boughs of the hemlock, as if with living fire. It seemed as if the beautiful forms of the elements were leagued against Lorraine's melancholy, and as he went before me with an elastic step, stopping to gaze up through the trees at every reach of the sky, I thanked God in my heart for the surpassing loveliness of nature. The moon shone sweetly that night. Paul wrapped himself in his cloak, and we went out to walk. The light lay softly upon the hills. The thin exhalations rose up and floated just palpably in the air; and a scent of wild flowers was abroad, as if the fairies were dancing on them in every green nook of the wilderness. I believe moonlight is sent for the feelings. It certainly makes some men better. There is an influence about it which cannot be resisted, and which glides into the heart with its subtle power, stealing away its grossness, and covering its dark thoughts like the ministry of an angel. Lorraine's mind had been aroused and prepared for such visitation. It melted him to a child. We sat down on a rock and he spoke for the first time of Marion. He wept freely, but silently, and without pain; for the fountains were broken up that had long been too full. He said the intolerable load of his heart was shaken off; that the image of Marion in the grave which had so haunted him, was removed, and he could think of her now as a pure spirit. Nature to his eye was changed. He had felt all day as if its light were coming back, and the moonlight was once more like the moonlight of his boyhood. He did not feel that he should so soon die. My story is done. I have no catastrophe to tell. My object was to write the history of a mind such as I have known, and exhibit nature as the physician and friend I believe she is. If my simple page should touch pleasantly a chord in the heart of any lover of her sweet influences, or lead one desponding mind to go out and be happy, its end will be answered. 5* DESCRIPTIVE SONNETS. BY H. PICKERING. THE SKY. The sun went calmly to his rest, but threw Upon the purple clouds, as he declined, His golden mantle. All he left behind Was beautiful and gorgeous; yet the view Of the pure sapphire sky above, most drew And fixed my ravished eye; and to my mind, No colors in the sunset clouds combined, Could, like the exquisite cerulean hue Of that bright heaven, so melt and fire the soul. Thou mightst have fancied, hadst thou gazed there, That thou hadst reached the long desired goal Of the blest spirits from our earth—so fair, And so serenely soft above my head, Seemed then that heavenly pavilion spread. AUTUMNAL PICTURE. A SKETCH. See how the forest waves! The gnarled oak Ev'n bends—and as the unruly wind sweeps through Its sturdy branches, showers of leaves bestrew The ground, or diverse fly; the crow, just broke From out the warring wood, with ominous croak Wheels heavily through the air; the glorious hue Of the bright mantle summer lately threw O'er earth, is gone; and the sere leaves now choak The turbid fountains and complaining brooks; The o'ershadowing pines, alone, through which I rove, Their verdure keep, although it darker looks; And hark! as it comes sighing through the grove, The exhausted gale a spirit there awakes, That wild and melancholy music makes. THE RAINBOW. AFTER A SUMMER TEMPEST. Symbol of peace! lo, there the ethereal bow! And see, on flagging wing, the storm retreats Far 'mid the depths of space; and with him fleets His lurid train—the while in beauty glow Vale, hill, and sky, once more. How lustrous now Earth's verdant mantle! and the woods how bright! Where grass, leaf, flower, are sparkling in the light— Prompt ever with the slightest breeze to throw The rain drops to the ground. Within the grove Music awakes; and from each little throat, Silent so long, bursts the wild note of love; The hurried babblings of the rill denote Its infant joy; and rushing swift along, The torrent gives to air, its hoarse and louder song. SUNLIGHT AT EVENING. How beautifully soft it seems to sleep Upon the lap of the unbreathing vale, And where, unruffled by the gentlest gale, The lake its bosom spreads, and in its deep, Clear wave, another world appears to keep, To steal the heart from this! for through the veil Transparent we may see, tree, rock, hill, dale, And sapphire sky, and golden mountain steep, That real seem, though fairer than our own;— Still, picture faint of that pure region drawn By prophet's pen, but not to mortal shown, Where flow rivers of bliss—and vale, and lawn Are strewn with flowers immortal—where, alone, Night never comes, and day is without dawn. THE CLOUDS. BY GRENVILLE MELLEN. O Clouds! ye ancient messengers, Old couriers of the sky, Treading as in primeval years, Yon still immensity! In march how wildly beautiful Along the deep ye tower, Begirt, as when from chaos dull Ye loomed in pride and power, To crown creation's morning hour. Ye perish not, ye passing clouds! But with the speed of Time, Ye flit your shadowy shapes, like shrouds, O'er each emerging clime; And thus on broad and furlless wings Ye float in light along, Where every jewelled planet sings Its clear eternal song, Over the path our friends have gone! Against that deep and peerless blue Ye hold your journeying— That silent birth-place of the dew, Where life and lustre spring. And then, how goldenly ye shine On your immortal way, Sailing through realms so near divine, Under the Fount of Day! O'er ye concentered glories play. But when, to trail this sullen earth Ye stoop from higher air, And the glad regions of your birth, To sweep the mountains bare, In dim funereal pomp ye lower— Oppressing like a pall— Your brows of beauty veiled in power, Whose shadows round us fall— Ye brood like demons o'er the ball. So our Life's hopes and promises In dreamy distance lie; So man a coming glory sees Along his visioned sky— So, as those rainbow joys come on, Borne with his fleeting days, That bright Futurity is gone, And dulness dims his gaze— Night gathers on his noontide blaze. Ye posters of the wakeless air! How silently ye glide Down the unfathomed atmosphere, That deep—deep, azure tide! And thus in giant pomp ye go, On high and reachless range, Above earth's gladness and its woe, Through centuries of change. Your destiny how lone and strange! Ye bear the Bow of Beauty—flung On your triumphal path, Splendid as first in joy it hung O'er God's retiring wrath. The promise and the covenant Are written on your brow— The mercy to the sinful sent Is bending o'er them now. Ye bear the memory of the Vow. Ye linger with the silver stars, Ye pass before the sun— Ye marshal elements to wars, And when the roar is done, Ye lift your volumed robes in light, And wave them to the world, Like victory flags o'er scattered fight, Brave banners all unfurled— Still there, though rent and tempest hurled. Ye bear the living thunder out, Ye pageants of the sky! Answering with trumpets' brattling shout The lightning's scorching eye. Pale faces cluster under ye, Beneath your withering look, And shaking hearts bow fearfully At your sublime rebuke. Has man his mockery forsook! And then, in still and summer hours, When men sit weary down, Ye come o'er heated fields and flowers, With shadowy pinions on— Ye hover where the fervent earth A saddened silence fills, And, mourning o'er its stricken mirth, Ye weep along the hills. Then how the wakening landscape thrills! And thus ye circle countless spheres, Old spirits of the skies! The same through Nature's smiles and tears, Ye rose on Paradise. I hear a voice from out your shrouds, That tells me of decay— For though ye stay not, hurtling clouds! Till the last gathering day, Ye pass like life's dim dreams away. THE PAMPAS PLAINS OF BUENOS AYRES. BY I. M'LELLAN. The Indians of whom I heard the most, were those who inhabit the vast unknown plains of the Pampas, and who are all horsemen, or rather pass their lives on horseback. The occupation of their lives is war, which they consider as their noble and most natural employment; and they declare, that the proudest attitude of the human figure is, when bending over his horse, man is riding at his enemy. Head's Journey over the Pampas and Andes. How calmly sleeps the desert! bright At times comes down the dim moonlight; And then yon sailing moon like gold, Dips in the huge cloud's blackened fold, And night's broad pinions, far and near, Darken the midnight atmosphere; Yet still those diamond stars on high Kindle the white frost brilliantly. Now stand we in the desert's heart, From all the peaceful world apart; Here is the roving Indian's land, And here by their watchfires, a band Of those fierce red men, strown around, Dream on their chilly couch, the ground. See, as the torch flames fiercely glow, The stern scowl on each swarthy brow! How strange and wild a scene! lo, here Glitters the Indian's ponderous spear; And there the flickering flames reveal The broad and sharpened battle steel; And by the embers, the hot blaze Each warrior's huge, dark frame displays; And at their feet the noble steed, That mocks the winged wind in speed. High rides the round, red moon; it shows Dimly those white, eternal snows, That aye, like silvery crowns, o'erspread Each kingly mountain's breezy head. Methinks I hear their thunders speak, And the loud earthquake shake each peak, And the hoar Andes' torrents bray In their stone channels, far away. Methinks on yon black mountain's base, The dark Cordillera, I trace The miner's simple hut, while high, Reared 'mid the tempests of the sky, Hangs the gray cross, that shows to all Some traveller's place of burial; And, far above the dizzy height, The condor wheels his lonely flight. Broad, bleak, illimitable plain! How like unto the shoreless main! Thy Pampas like its billows gleam, And yon lone tree methinks doth seem Like to some black, tall ship that rides Alone amid the heaving tides, And the gaunt creatures roaming free Seem like the monsters of the sea. And these are sons of kings—full long They ruled these wilds—a princely throng— VOL. I. 6 And each led on his thousand spears, To scourge the land in those old years, And these their children bear the same Bold hearts, strong hands, and swords of flame— The ostrich and the tiger quail When their free shouts are on the gale. NEW OXFORD. BY THE AUTHOR OF `MORAL PIECES.' The rash intolerance of Louis the Fourteenth reached its climax in the revocation of the Edict of Nantz. That mad persecution of the Huguenots, which he styled `zeal for the extirpation of heresy,' might not subside until it had deprived his realm of half a million of his most valuable subjects. `France,' said Queen Christina, `is like a diseased man, who submits to the amputation of legs and arms, to cure a disease, which gentle treatment might conquer.' The Huguenots had endured the evils of an insolent soldiery quartered in their habitations, who, under the pretence of converting them to the Catholic faith, committed every outrage upon their property, persons, and families. Many were forced to become wanderers, or to take shelter in caves, and others yielded their lives to torture, rather than sin against the dictates of conscience. Still in their deepest depression, the edict of Henry of Navarre, which, in 1589, had given peace to their suffering fathers, continued to administer hope to them, until the fatal December of 1685, when it was revoked. They now every moment expected a repetition of the horrors of St Bartholomew. Flight was their only alternative, and to this many obstacles were opposed. Armed guards were stationed by the despot, to prevent their escape from the kingdom. Fathers were forced to immure their families in damp caverns, for temporary concealment, whence they issued, pale and emaciated. Delicate females, whom the breath of heaven had never before visited roughly, might be seen wandering unprotected amid the chill of winter; or in the recesses of some forest, a mother might be discovered hushing her wailing infant, lest its cries should direct the pursuit of the brutal soldier. Yet guided by that God whom they served, hundreds of thousands fled their beloved country and unnatural monarch, and found a peaceful refuge among pitying strangers. `What multitudes,' says the Abbé Millot, `of merchants, mechanics, officers, and learned men, were thus irrevocably lost to France?' The New World profited by this prodigality of the Old; nor was it of slight consequence, that among the elements of our national character, were blended the diligence, patience, and piety of a race faithful unto death for conscience' sake. Among those Huguenots who brought to our shores a wealth more incorruptible than silver or gold, were the congregation of the Reverend Pierre Daillé, a descendant of the learned John Daillé, author of the celebrated `Apology for the Reformed Churches.' They had been fortunate in effecting an escape, with the loss of but few of their number; and in two small vessels, Le Coligni and La Marguerete, directed their course to the shores of New England. The perils of their scantily appointed voyage, and the dangers of approaching our coast during the severity of a wintry snow storm, we do not mean to recount. Suffice it to say, that they arrived in Boston, worn and weary, but full of gratitude to their Preserver, and were received with that kind hospitality, which still makes so strong a feature in the character of that beautiful city. Little more than threescore years had elapsed since the first footsteps of our pilgrim ancestors explored the wilds and rocks of Plymouth. A few of these survived with hoary locks, to welcome the persecuted strangers, and bless that martyr spirit, with which their own had such strong affinity. The remainder of the winter was passed by the exiles in Boston, during which negotiations were concluded with Governor Dudley for the purchase of a tract of land for their future residence. It comprised the site which the present town of Oxford now occupies, in the county of Worcester, at the distance of about thirty miles from Boston. The river which intersects its beautiful vales, received from the emigrants the name of French River, which it still retains; but why they preferred for their settlement the appellation of New Oxford to some of the more romantic ones which the recollections of their native clime might have furnished, tradition does not inform us. As soon as the season permitted, some of the most hardy of the strangers, with a guide and assistants from the coast, went to take possession of their territory, to erect a few temporary habitations, and, in the technical language of the country, to `make a clearing.' Spring had a little advanced when the more delicate part of the colonists followed. The young turf was springing, and the silver leaf of the willow had hung out its banner. They entered on their hardships and privations with a cheerfulness which nothing could subdue. In those forests where Silence had reigned since the creation, they found a temple where God might be worshipped, free from the tyranny of man; and they who had been accustomed to the comforts of a luxuriant clime, went forth to their daily labor amid tangled thickets, and returned nightly to their rude cabin, `an everlasting hymn within their souls.' Next to the care of providing habitations was that of erecting a small fort, as a refuge in case of an incursion of the aborigines. The tribe of Nipmuck Indians were borderers upon their territory, but evinced friendly dispositions toward the new settlers. A shelter from the storm, or a covert for the night was occasionally granted these children of the forest, and this simple hospitality seemed the groundwork of lasting amity. A few years wrought manifest changes in this infant colony. An air of neatness, and even of comfort, began to pervade the simple dwellings. Each had a spot devoted to the purposes of horticulture, where the seeds of France were already springing, as if forgetful that they grew in a foreign soil, and her vines putting forth their graceful tendrils, and timidly seeking a support. The pastor who had led his flock into the wilderness, took part in their labors and sorrows with a zeal which knew no declension. He aided them with his advice, or sat by their bed of disease, soothing their afflictions and heightening their joys by the hope of heaven. Piety was not with him merely a garb for the sabbath; every day it was seen walking with him, and enlightening the steps of others. It was impossible to be long in his presence without perceiving that his heart was above, not by moroseness or contempt of earthly cares, but by a secret and powerful influence which was ever lifting upward the thoughts of others. In his familiar visits to each domestic altar, amid the unrestrained flow of discourse which prompted every heart to pour out itself to him, an ejaculation, or the simple raising of his benign eye to heaven, was a signal to his confiding and half adoring flock, for the spirit to commune with its Father, if it were only through the aspiration of a moment. 6* His wife, whose education and manners might have qualified her to move in courts, found no greater pleasure than in lending her aid to her beloved partner, in the instruction of the children of their people, and the comfort of the sick and the mourner. The fourteenth anniversary of the settlement of New Oxford approached. Every thing wore the appearance of a colony prosperous by its own industry. Some had exchanged their early dwellings for others of a better construction; and several had been added, for those who in childhood quitted their native land, yet had themselves become the founders of families. In their simple and unvitiated state of society, marriage, being solely the result of love, knew none of those obstructions which fashion and self-interest often interpose in its path. It was also contracted at an early period, for where celibacy is considered a dereliction of Nature's dictates, the approaches toward its boundary are deemed ungraceful. That false refinement or coldness of calculation, be it which it may, which prompts the inhabitants of cities, to defer a union which is to cheer the winter of life, until the beauties of its spring are past, was unknown here. An ordinance whose influence is so powerful over the destinies both of mortality and immortality, they held it desirable to solemnize ere the heart was rendered insensible by time, or the affections rigid by disappointment. Many of the more recently bridal tenements were tastefully ornamented with flowering shrubs, and trained vines, and not one in the settlement was without a garden appropriated to the cultivation of vegetables. That of Father Daillé was principally a nursery of young fruit trees and medicinal plants. His skill in horticulture enabled him to transplant from among the former many acceptable presents for his people, while his knowledge of the science of medicine instructed him successfully to apply the latter to the relief of their physical infirmities. As yet no diseases of a serious nature had appeared among them. They forcibly illustrated how much industry promotes health of body, and moderated desires, health of mind. All were zealous to impart to their beloved pastor those productions for which they could not endure that a care should enter his mind, or divide his thoughts from their spiritual welfare. He created also another claim upon their affections, by assuming, in a great degree, the instruction of their children. His mind, deeply imbued with science, could not tolerate the idea that the rising generation should grow up in that ignorance which is so often the misfortune of new colonies. He appointed, therefore, to the boys and young men, stated lessons in the necessary departments of knowledge, judiciously adapted to their difference of age or capacity, and regularly convened them at his house for examination. His pastoral visits were always so conducted as to be subservient to the pursuits in which his pupils were engaged. It was then his delight to bestow explanation, to encourage perseverance, and to rouse indolence from slumber. An ardor to excel was thus strongly excited, and amid the daily processes of agricultural labor, animated conversations might be heard founded on their respective studies. Those whose proficiency was respectable, were admitted to his familiar lectures upon the higher branches of science and literature, and this was an honor sufficient to stimulate every exertion. Thus the good man had the satisfaction of perceiving his young charge initiated into that general knowledge which gives to thought liberality and resource. He could not fail to perceive that his influence over their opinions and affections was becoming unbounded; and he often thought, as he contemplated his little seminary, `are ye not all branches of my planting?' Madame Daillé also extended the same care over the young females. Each, after being taught to read by the mother, attended her stated recitations. Here they repeated the lessons which had been assigned, and were questioned respecting their practical knowledge of the various departments of female industry and virtue. To gain her approbation was an object worthy to stimulate every effort, while her frown was dreaded like the reproof of conscience. Having herself received a finished education, it was impossible for her to maintain an intercourse of this nature, without imparting its benefits. Not only superior intelligence marked the more distinguished among her scholars, but all under her care displayed a correctness of deportment, and courtesy of manner, which are usually acquired only among the more polished classes of society. It was her custom at the close of her weekly examinations, to relate either some historical fact, or some invention of her own prolific imagination, which, in the form of a concise story, illustrated moral truth, reproved the errors which fell under her observation, or enforced the principles of piety. Yet it was not the intention of this highly cultivated lady, to turn the attention of her pupils too exclusively to literature, aware that in a new colony there are duties to be discharged, by her sex, for which no intellectual eminence will compensate. She would sometimes point to the fields of flax, whose blossoms tinged with a fine blue the vale around them, and expatiate on the excellence of those arts which could render this plant so subservient to the comfort of those whom they loved. Hence the distaff, the loom, and the needle, were considered honorable and graceful appendages, and every household was desirous that its internal manufactures should not only be equivalent to its own wants, but to the aid of those whom sickness might preclude from their accustomed diligence. On Saturday evening the two schools met each other, to receive instruction in those principles of religion which are of common concern, and to practise sacred psalmody, it being the wish of Father Daillé, that all his congregation should be qualified to lift up, as with one voice, the high praises of God. There was something inexpressibly affecting in the pouring forth of that foreign music in this new land; the soft summer breezes, and the echo of the woods, seemed to prolong the cadence, as if they strove to naturalize the stranger melody. Thus peaceful and happy were the Huguenots whose fortunes we have hitherto pursued. The simple toils of agriculture gave them health and subsistence, the vain pursuit of wealth had not diseased their imaginations, nor the poison of ambition corrupted their hearts. Each householder considered the portion of ground attached to his habitation as his own. The remainder was an undivided, undisputed possession. Their herds drew nutriment from one common pasture; and on the plantations of maize or fields of grain, each man bestowed his portion of labor, and without jealousy divided the harvest. Lycurgus might have here seen illustrated his favorite theory of the Laconian brotherhood. No dissonance of opinion had hitherto arisen, which the advice of the elders could not harmonize, and the patriarch Daillé gave daily thanks in his prayer, that one soul of love seemed infused into all his children. It is with grief that we darken this scene of more than Arcadian felicity. In the spring of 1700 it was deemed expedient to prepare for planting a large piece of land, at some distance from their earliest clearings, and thither one fine morning almost all the effective strength of the colony was gathered. Jeanson, a man greatly respected for his serene gravity of deportment, and amiable disposition, having been detained at home later than his associates, was about taking his departure to join them, when the report of a musket was heard, and he fell weltering upon the green turf that skirted his threshold. Several Indians from an adjoining thicket then rushed into the house, and a scene of slaughter and desolation ensued, unparalleled, but in the annals of savage warfare. Those beautiful children, the infant in its cradle, the mother, intent upon their protection, not one was spared. The blood of the innocents empurpled the hearth stone of their murdered parents. At the sudden alarm, the colonists collected with agonized haste, yet too late to overtake the spoilers, whose flight was as rapid, as their deeds had been destructive. The mourning among the colonists it would be in vain to describe. Each man felt that he had lost a brother, and as he looked upon his dearest ones, shuddered lest they also might be stretched before his eyes, in the same terrible array of death. Apprehensive of a repetition of evil, necessary measures of precaution were taken; the more helpless retired to the fort, armed sentinels were placed for protection during the night, and the elders of the people met in consultation. Their countenances, usually so serene, were now variously marked with grief and indignation. `Let us,' said Johonnet, with impassioned gestures, `pursue with the dawn of morning, these barbarians. We will leave our wives and children in the fort, and not return until our brother's blood is fully avenged. The shades of the great Condé and Coligni shall not reproach us with suffering the lawless murderers to live.' Boutineau spoke next, an elder whose hair was silvered. `Their mode of warfare is as peculiar as their habits of life. They never meet in open battle, and who can pursue them into their wilds, and hope to return? While we are seeking to carry retribution into their wigwams, they might suddenly fall upon the precious pledges whom we leave behind, and extinguish our light forever. Surely our only mode of defence is in perpetual vigilance, and in never losing sight of our habitations.' `That our movements are narrowly watched,' said Sejourneé, `is evident, from their having waited for the absence of almost every man able to bear arms, ere they hazarded this attack. It is not to be supposed that poor Jeanson had awakened their vindictive feelings, he, whose intercourse with all mankind was so peaceful. But the situation of his house, on the outskirts of the settlement, furnished apparent facility for satiating their cruelty with the least danger of retaliation. Does not this create suspicion of latent hostility towards the whole? And if it exist, will not a foe so subtle find fitting occasions to gratify it? Who can endure a life of perpetual watchfulness and dread, yet which of us will dare to lose sight of his home, lest at returning he should find his dearest blood flowing around his threshold?' Others expressed their opinions, yet ceased by an anxious appeal to Father Daillé as umpire. `The tribe upon our boundary,' he answered, `is powerful, and much influenced by a vindictive prophet, who strives to instigate them to the extermination of all white men. This is probably the commencement of a series of aggressions. Your valor I know. It has been proved when men's souls were tried in the furnace. All that mortals could do, for the protection of their domestic altars, you would do, without a thought of fear or of repining. Yet ere we enter upon such a course, it becomes us to count the cost. While you stand in perpetual armor, the toils by which you gain subsistence, must decline, or be laid aside. To a peaceful people, this state of military watchfulness, and sleepless dread, would rob our brief life of half its value. Yet should a season of quiet, at any time lull our vigilance, who could assure us that the war whoop of the savage, or the midnight conflagration enwrapping our cottages, would not break our miserable slumbers? `Brethren and sons, let us return to that city, which first gave us welcome, when as exiles we came to this new world. There we shall find that safety, which we may be either too weak to secure, or forced to purchase at the expense of the blood of some, who are far dearer to us than life. Other employments than those of agriculture, may there procure subsistence for our families, and eventually we may dispose of these lands to colonists of more effective strength, or who may more readily command the aid of government in repelling the aggressions of the aborigines. Yet if in these prudential calculations I should be mistaken, still I cannot endure the thought that another of that number, who are as jewels in my heart, should be thus sacrificed. Merciless sons of the forest! “Me have ye bereaved of my children!” It is enough! However tender may be the ties which we sunder in leaving this beloved spot, I cannot consent to remain here, with the hazard of yielding to the scalping knife of the Indian, one more of these my children.' After a protracted consultation, the wish of the pastor became the decision of all, and the opinion was unanimous, that if the removal were made, it had better be immediate. They lingered but to make such preparations as were unavoidable, and to pay the last sad obsequies to the departed. The succeeding day drew near its close, when, bearing the mangled bodies of the slaughtered family, the whole colony in solemn procession entered the humble building which had served for a church. When the six coffins were laid side by side, the burst of grief was deep and universal. The man of God waited until the waves of agony were broken. Furrows of painful thought were upon his brow, but his bearing was as one whose heart is in heaven. When there was silence, he stretched forth his hand to the people. `Ye come, as the Israelites to their passover, with loins girded, and staves in your hands, as men in haste for a journey. He who past through the land of Egypt in judgment, hath been among us. The blood of our firstborn is upon the posts and doors of our houses. Lambs without blemish have been slain, and ye this day garnish them with bitter herbs. Yet let us not go forth despairing, though we must journey beneath the cloud. We will not say, Jehovah hath forgotten us. So long the recipients of his bounty on this very spot, is it meet that we should part hence, without once more uniting in his worship? Ye know that tomorrow is the fourteenth birthday of this village. We hoped to have celebrated it with hymns of thanksgiving. Now, if our incense be robbed of its fragrance, and our melody mingled with the voices of them that weep, there is One who hath compassion upon our infirmities, and will not break the leaf driven before the tempest. `Many things press upon me to be spoken. But ye cannot bear them now. Ye are called this day to pass over the swelling of Jordan. Take the Ark of the Covenant upon your shoulders. Place yourselves beneath VOL. I. 7 the wing of the cherubims that overshadow it—arise and depart, for this is not your rest. `Scene of our refuge, when our native land cast us out! thou little Zoar where we prayed that we might enter from the storm of the Lord! vales where the song of our industry hath arisen! forests which have yielded to our stroke! homes of our happiness every year more dear, hallowed by the smile of joy, and the voice of supplication! we bid you all adieu. Holy church! consecrated by our humble prayers, our sacred symphonies, our hopes that rested not upon this earth, we bid thee farewell in the name of the Lord. Wherever we wander, though our tears should drop in the fountains of strange waters, never will we forget thee, our Zion in the wilderness! Lifeless remains of the brave and the beautiful, the virtuous and the beloved, severed branches! crushed blossoms! what shall we say? Ah! how often will our sorrowing hearts recall your images, as they once were—as they now are, stretched before us. What shall we say? Oh! our souls! nothing is without God. The Prophet saw him in the whirlwind, and the fire rending the rock in pieces. Though he maketh darkness his pavilion, let us wait, as those who yet hope to see the clear shining of his throne. `Souls of the departed! if ye have attained that heaven where the storm beateth not, where tears are wiped from all eyes forever; if from that clime of bliss, ye behold us, compassed with infirmity and woe, oh! teach us how slight all the thorns, the tempests, of this pilgrimage seem, now ye are at rest. My children, what avails it, where we pitch our tents for the remnant of this shadowy life, if the angel who removeth their curtains in a moment, but find the pure spirit ready to meet its God?' He ceased, and the services of devotion rose in deep and solemn response from among the people. Fathers and mothers knelt amid their children, and with one voice invoked and blessed the King of kings. The memory of their sorrows and their fears arose in the soul's high aspiration, as the flame beareth on its spire the vanishing smoke towards heaven. Hands hardened with labor, and faces pale with watching, the eye of the mother and of the babe, were alike lifted upward, while they gave thanks to the Father of Mercies. Then ensued a pause of deep silence, and every head was bowed down, while the unuttered individual orison ascended. Still there was a pause. The people waited for their wonted benediction. `Part we hence,' said the pastor, `part we hence forever, without one holy song? While the fountain of our breath is unsealed, let it give praise to the Preserver.' He designated a plaintive anthem from the seventh of Job. It burst forth in sweetness, but soon the dirge-like melody became tremulous. After the strain, `Oh remember that our life is wind,' the cadence was so protracted as to be almost inaudible. Still feebly and slowly the chant proceeded; `As the cloud vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more; he shall not return to his house, his place shall know him no more.' But music could not long survive amid the swell of such agitating emotions. It trembled—one or two quivering voices prolonged it; but they sank, and tones of sorrow arose in their stead. The man of God stood up, and blessed the people, and with eyes bent to earth, led the way to the churchyard. There, upon the fresh springing turf, each coffin was laid by its open cell. Every head was humbled to the earth, while the pastor, kneeling among the graves, poured forth fervent supplications, like the prophet who lifted his censer between the dead and the living. Tears were upon all faces, as the bodies were deposited in their narrow house. Children sobbed aloud, and groans burst from manly bosoms, when the earth, falling upon the coffins, sent forth that hollow sound, which he who hath paid the last duties to beloved dead, hath felt in his soul. Again the man of God spoke, extending his hand toward the grassy mounds that surrounded them. `Graves of our friends! those that have been long sealed, and those now enriched with new treasure, we thought that our bones should here have rested with you. Looking upon you, we have often said, Here too shall we also be gathered unto our people. Jehovah humbleth the foresight of man. He knoweth not even where his bed shall be, when this frail tabernacle falleth like a frittered garment. Yet what avails it, with what portion of clay our bodies mingle, if our souls gain the mansion prepared by their Redeemer? What avails it whether to the bosom of earth or ocean we resign the image of the earthly, if we are at last found worthy to bear the image of the heavenly? `But, oh! what were man without the promise of a resurrection! What were he, when the grave whelms his joys, but for the sure hope of eternal life! What were we, if now forced to ask in uncertainty and anguish, Who shall roll us away the stone from the the door of these sepulchres? `Mourning souls! come, return unto your God. He hath smitten, and he alone can heal. He hath troubled the waters which were at rest, but the Angel of Mercy still waiteth there, and the wounded spirits shall be made whole.' They turned from the place of sepulchres, and the next sun saw their simple habitations desolate. Not a sound of rural labor was heard, and no young children were seen searching for violets which the early spring had awakened. Scarcely the striking of the Arab tents produces deeper silence, or a wider solitude. The red men of the forest roamed at will among those tenantless dwellings, wreaking an unsatisfied vengeance upon each vestige of their former inhabitants. The Huguenots, thus a second time exiled, found in Boston the welcome reception and peaceful asylum which they had anticipated. Their excellences of character were also fully appreciated, and laid the groundwork of many lasting and valuable friendships with the native Bostonians. Competence, and in some cases comparative wealth, rewarded their diligent application to business; and to this day, their descendants look back with reverence to the persevering, unostentatious virtues of their ancestors. In the course of the year 1713, the lands which they had vacated were occupied by a second colony, who retained the name of Oxford, omitting the appellation of New, which had originally been attached to it. Their house for public worship, erected four years after their return to Boston, was situated near the spot where the present Universalist Church in School Street now stands, and is designated in the records of those times, as the French Protestant Church. Father Daillé continued his accustomed ministrations to his flock, winning friends by his ardent piety and affable deportment, until summoned by death to his reward, in 1715. His successor was the Reverend Andrew le Mercier, author of the `Church History of Geneva, with a Political and Geographical Account of that Republic.' In the Granary Burying Ground in Boston, the graves of the venerable `Pierre Daillé and Seyre his wife,' are distinctly visible, with their simple inscriptions. But it is amid the fair scenery of Oxford, that we are 7* most forcibly reminded of their images, their privations, their patience, their lives devoted to the service of God and to the good of mankind. There also a gray haired man points out to the traveller a deep hollow in the turf, and tells him, `Here stood the house of Jeanson, the French Protestant, who, with his family, perished by the Indians.' The most aged inhabitants of that pleasant vale say, that within their remembrance, the hearth stone on which the brains of those beautiful babes gushed out, still retained its crimson stain, resisting the action of the elements long after the dwelling was dilapidated by time. But among the most interesting vestiges of this settlement of the Huguenots, are the ruins of the rustic fort constructed for their defence, and bearing the antiquity of nearly a century and an half. There, within a quadrangle of ninety feet, from whence the stones have been removed for the convenience of agriculture, may still be traced the well from whence they first drew water in this foreign home. Asparagus, whose seed was originally brought from France, continues annually to burst the investing mould, a simple witness of the truth of this history; and peach and apple trees, probably the descendants of their ancient nurseries, are entwined by the coarse vine, and varied by the indigenous rose of this country. Should any one doubt the veracity of these assertions, let him explore the spot; trace, through tangled grass, the path of the persecuted emigrants; behold the monuments of their industry, their consolation, their defence; put his hand, as it were, `into the print of the nails, and be no longer faithless but believing.' Should he also to skepticism add indifference, let him seat himself upon those disjointed stones, once the rude barrier against the ruder savage; recline beneath those shades so often hallowed by the prayers of Christians, recall their firmness in danger, their fortitude in affliction, their chastened joy in prosperity; impress on his imagination their image, bowing beneath perils in the wilderness for conscience' sake; and see, if, like the Lawgiver of Israel, he feel not inclined to `put his shoes from his feet, because the ground whereon he standeth is holy.' ON SEEING A BEAUTIFUL BOY AT PLAY. BY N. P. WILLIS. Down the green slope he bounded. Raven curls From his white shoulders by the winds were swept, And the clear rose leaf of his sunny cheek Was bright with motion. Through his open lips Shone visibly a delicate line of pearl, Like a white streaking in a tulip drawn, And his dark eye's clear brilliance, as it lay Beneath his lashes like a drop of dew Hid in the moss, stole out as covertly As starlight from the edging of a cloud. I never saw a boy so beautiful. His step was like the stooping of a bird, And his limbs melted into grace like things Shaped by the wind of summer. He was like A painter's fine conception—such an one As he would have of Ganymede, and weep Upon his pallet that he could not win The vision to his easel. Who could paint The young and shadowless spirit? Who could chain The visible gladness of a heart that lives, Like a glad fountain, in the eye of light, With an unbreathing pencil? Nature's gift Has nothing that is like it. Sun and stream, And the new leaves of June, and the young lark That flees away into the depths of heaven, Lost in his own mad music, and the breath Of spring time, and the summer eve, and noon In the cool autumn, are like fingers swept Over sweet toned affections—but the joy That enters to the spirit of a child Is deep as his young heart; his very breath, The simple sense of being, is enough To ravish him, and like a thrilling touch He feels each moment of his life go by. Beautiful, beautiful childhood! with a joy That like a robe is palpable, and flung Out by your every motion! delicate bud Of the immortal flower that will unfold And come to its maturity in heaven! I weep your earthly glory. 'T is a light Lent to the new born spirit that goes out With the first idle wind. It is the leaf Fresh flung upon the river, that will dance Upon the wave that stealeth out its life, Then sink of its own heaviness. The face Of the delightful earth will to your eye Grow dim; the fragrance of the many flowers Be noticed not, and the beguiling voice Of nature in her gentleness will be To manhood's senseless ear inaudible. I sigh to look upon thy face, young boy!— THE HAUNTED GRAVE. BY E. P. BLOUNT. The sun had set and the last faint trace Of the twilight dimly burned, When with a light and hastening pace The hunter homeward turned. He had been out on the hills all day Amidst the old gray woods, And the chase had lured him far away Into their solitudes. But now when its stirring joys were past, He thought of his pleasant home— Of the anxious looks to the forests cast, And the prayers that he might come— And he hastened on with a rapid tread; But the fading light was gone, And the mountain path that homeward led, Was a dark and a lonely one. And the fogs were gathering dense and chill, And the clouds shut out the moon, And the autumn winds, before so still, Sighed forth a desolate tune; And harsh low sounds were heard among The dead boughs of the trees;— But he had dwelt on the hills too long To fear such things as these. Then the night owl's scream came ominously Upon the burdened air, And the hunter's heart at the boding cry Felt a superstitious fear. And he cast a timorous look before, And a timorous look behind, For a thousand fearful tales of yore, Came thronging on his mind. He had almost reached the hill where lies The Indian burial place, And his mind was full of the memories And the legends of their race. Still the branches creaked above his head, And the screechowl moaned alway, And a gloomy light the fire fly shed, And the frogs croaked out their lay. But on he urged—he was at the side Of the Indian sepulchre; —But why doth he stop as if life's fresh tide In his heart had ceased to stir? He saw on that ancient grave uprise A form distinct and clear, And he knew by its tall gigantic size, 'T was the chief's whose bones were there. The night fogs were out upon the land, And the distant owl screeched on, When he saw the chief raise a shadowy hand, And wave him to begone. Aghast he turned—`through brook, through briar,' Full swiftly hastened he, Till he saw the light of his cottage fire Shining bright and peacefully. Upheaving 'mongst the leaves that grave Is visible even yet, And the ancient woods that o'er it wave, Are kept inviolate. And since that time no living wight Of all the country round, Dares after the fall of the dim twilight Approach that haunted ground. EXTRACT FROM A JOURNAL OF AN EXCURSION FROM MONTREAL TO ST ANDREWS. BY THE AUTHOR OF `A CANADIAN LEGEND.' We were now sailing on the Lake of the Two Mountains, here twentyfive miles broad, the waves as smooth and polished as a mirror, and gemmed with innumerable green islands. The shores were in many places bold and finely wooded, and little flourishing settlements frequently burst upon the eye, crowned by a glittering spire, and surrounded by luxuriant and well cultivated farms; while the western horizon was bounded by a range of highlands, sometimes swelling into what in this level country are termed mountains. An Indian village of considerable extent had long been in view, and we approached it just where the waters again narrowed into the channel of the Ottawa. A few canoes were lightly skimming the waves, navigated by Indians and squaws, in their fantastic dresses; and in one of these little barks, Judge Macdonald recognised Big Tom, a noted chief, preeminently distinguished by the superior splendor of his tinsel gewgaws, and the number of red feathers which decorated his head. These villages, for there are two, separated only by the church, are inhabited by rival tribes, the Algonquins and Six Nations. The latter were formerly the most powerful tribe in North America, and are still lords of the soil as far as the eye can reach, retaining as hunting grounds all the immense tracts of forest skirting the borders of the lake and river, possessions which are guarantied to them by the laws of the country. They spend their summers principally in roving expeditions, and return with the cold weather to enjoy the fruits of their labors. The Algonquins were a strange tribe from the banks of the Hudson, who came and took up their residence in the neighbourhood of the Six Nations. They were viewed with aversion and distrust by their powerful rivals, and frequent feuds and skirmishes took place between them. At length a deeper cause rooted the hatred which existed between them. It happened that six bold young chiefs of the Six Nations set off on a hunting expedition, in pursuit of some peculiarly obnoxious animal, that had committed great depredations on their territory; but after several days, they returned, disappointed and unsuccessful from the chase. Six young men of the Algonquins, animated by a spirit of emulation and adventure, and hoping for better success, then went privately off, in the same pursuit. They proved victorious, and were returning in triumph with the spoils of the enemy, when their rivals, jealous of the renown they would acquire, and mortified at their own defeat, treacherously waylaid, and murdered them. The relatives of the unfortunate Algonquins were too feeble to revenge their death by declaring open war against their formidable neighbours; but the injury was never forgotten, and they embraced every opportunity to annoy and harass their treacherous foe, when they could do it with impunity. It is now many years since this event happened; but it has not yet been forgotten or forgiven by the Algonquins. They, however, from political motives doubtless, live, in general, peaceably with the Six Nations, and even occasionally intermarry. The village belonging to the latter tribe is extensive and ancient. It was flourishing even so far back as 1611, when Monsieur Champlain penetrated into the country. That occupied by the Algonquins was first visible to us. We admired its neatness, the regularity of its houses, many of them two stories high, with steep red roofs, and the white mansion of the chief, situated on a smooth green turf, apart from the others, and surrounded by stately forest trees. We were told to suspend our admiration till we saw the rival village; and, when opposite the church, a central point, which commanded a fine view of both, we were forced to acknowledge, that it indeed exhibited marks of opulence and taste that would have honored a state of refined civilization. The tout ensemble was truly beautiful. We were not sufficiently near to distinguish objects minutely; and the distance, while it heightened the illusions of fancy, concealed all the blemishes, and disclosed only the interesting outlines of the picture. The church is a large stone building, well proportioned, and, as usual in Canada, ornamented with a tin covered spire, surmounted by a cross. Adjoining it, on each side, is a commodious range of houses, also of stone, inhabited by the priests of the respective tribes; and, in front of the whole, a noble avenue of elms stretches for a considerable distance along the bank of the river. It was a holiday; and, as we sailed slowly past, we observed a procession of priests in their black flowing robes, followed by a multitude of Indians, men and women, tricked out in feathers and glittering ornaments, with dark blankets wrapped, like cloaks, about them; each VOL. I. 8 hostile tribe walking with solemn steps, beneath the deep shadow of the trees, to meet and throw aside their animosities, and engage together in the imposing ceremonies of their religion. It was a picturesque and novel sight; more like a dream of enchantment, than anything I ever witnessed. We gazed till each dusky figure had disappeared from view, and the sound of the vesper bell mingled its last sweet note with the rippling of the waves. Around the village were rich pastures, fields of grain and Indian corn; and beyond it rose a thickly wooded hill of considerable height and extent, crowned by a small white chapel, which is distinctly seen from a great distance. It was placed there in commemoration of the Passion of our Saviour, and there are two of still smaller size, on the declivities of the hill. Every year great multitudes of Catholics, for they are not appropriated exclusively to Indian worshippers, walk to them in procession, and celebrate high mass and other offices of their religion. At length we came once more within view of the island of Montreal, and hailed as we would have done the familar features of a friend, its green mountains and cultivated plains, its substantial farm houses, and pretty country seats and villas. Our companion pointed out to us an object of peculiar interest to our national feelings. It was a dilapidated windmill, and the grassy remains of a fort which had fallen into the possession of our gallant General Montgomery, when he captured the island, and, near by, the ruins of a house which he took by assault. The house, it seems, was the residence of a private French gentleman, but fortified to secure it from the depredations of the Indians. The general had peremptory orders to seize upon every fortified place, and, of course, though with reluctance, felt compelled to take possession of this, which yielded without resistance. Fortunately for the traveller, who loves to find traces of other times, and identify them with natural scenery, it has never been rebuilt. It stands alone in a peculiarly romantic spot, half buried in the foliage of gigantic trees. I should say the walls stand; for scarcely anything else remains of what it was. They are of stone, but fast crumbling away, and fringed with moss and lichens; and the apertures, where once were windows, are twined with ivy, which curls and wreathes itself fantastically over the gray and shattered building. It was a beautiful object, and might have harmonized well with the landscapes of an older country. I had never before seen anything which could at all realize the ideas I have conceived of those European ruins which have so often charmed my imagination, and I gazed upon it till its faintest outline had melted away in the distance. About sunset we approached the St Ann rapids; we had been watching with interest the gradually increasing rapidity of the current; and, long before we reached them, the tremendous roaring of the waters burst upon our ears. All was haste and preparation. The sails were lowered, and the Canadian boatmen set up that hideous shouting and hallooing from one side of the vessel to the other, which is always a prelude to any season of peculiar danger or difficulty. The water now began to foam, and dash, and break with violence over the rocks. The captain, who seemed rather stupid, wore an uncommonly anxious look, which attracted my notice, and I asked him if he had never been over the rapids before. He replied, that it was the first time he had ever commanded the boat, but he had often sailed on the river, and knew the course. Could my heart have been appalled in the midst of so grand and beautiful a scene, his ignorance might have occasioned me some alarm, particularly as I learned that many of the crew were likewise strangers; but everything was so exciting and magnificent about me, that my whole attention was absorbed, and I was only anxious to conceal the circumstance from my companions, who discovered a slight uneasiness, and proposed going on shore; a plan I had no wish to adopt. However, we safely passed the rapids; the boat plunged, and for an instant almost sunk in the waves that curled and dashed around her. Every tongue was silent, and never did I experience a sensation of such mingled awe and delight. We looked back upon the fearful pitch, with emotions which it is impossible to describe. The angry element, bathed in the rich crimson of the setting sun, was lashing itself to fury, and, in the midst of the most frightful breakers, appeared a little bark canoe, whose progress we watched with intense interest. One moment it rode triumphantly on the summit of a foaming billow, the next sunk almost from view, apparently too fragile to withstand the overwhelming torrent. But it bravely weathered the host of dangers which beset it, and, shooting swiftly past us, soon left our more sluggish vessel far behind. We were now passing the pretty village of St Ann's. Its church, standing on a little promontory, extending into the rapids, was a most pleasing object, a beacon in the midst of rocks and dangers. Just at this time, the wind again subsided, and left us totally becalmed. Night was fast approaching, and we began to grow impatient; for we had entered the St Lawrence, at the end of the island, and from thence to La Chine its navigation is rather difficult. The captain, we were now convinced, knew little of it, as in confirmation of our previous suspicions, Miss — heard the Judge say to him, just after we passed the rapids, `Why did you come over that steep pitch? It was not the right channel.' To which he replied, `It was the helmsman's fault; he had never been over before, and knew nothing about it.' Many of the sailors also were half intoxicated; they had amused themselves, during the calm in the morning, with drinking perpetually, and had become noisy and rude, and were unwilling to use their oars. At the foot of the rapids, Judge Macdonald showed us the spot where a most dreadful accident happened in the spring. Mr and Mrs H., with three children and three female servants, were passing down the river, on their way to Quebec. They landed, and walked past the rapids; but as the children complained of fatigue, returned to the boat too soon, and were but a few yards from the shore, when one of the boatmen, who was intoxicated, by an unskilful use of the oar created an eddy which tipped the canoe on one side. This alarmed the servants, who, instead of remaining quiet, rose suddenly up, and by their imprudence completely overset the boat. Mr H., who was an excellent swimmer, seized one of the children but a wave washed it instantly from his arms. He remained in the water a long time, vainly searching for the remainder of his family, till entirely exhausted he was compelled to go on shore, but in a state bordering on distraction. Mrs H., however, was most providentially preserved. On dragging the canoe to land she was discovered fastened in between the seats, but lifeless and benumbed by her long submersion. Her recovery, which was almost unhoped for, seemed miraculous, and it was long before they dared to inform her of the dreadful extent of her loss. Her husband was obliged to dissemble and stifle his agony in her presence, but in private it nearly overpowered his reason. They shortly after this dreadful event, proceeded to Quebec. The bodies of the children were found, brought to town, and buried. One of the servant women escaped, the others never rose. 8* Soon after passing this melancholy spot, we met a large Durham boat, under full sail, streamers flying, and a band of music playing delightfully. There was a merry party on board, and among them some gentlemen of our acquaintance, who saluted us with Yankee Doodle as they passed. They were striving to clear the rapids before dark. These were the scenes in which Moore composed, or rather imitated from the French, his beautiful Canadian boat song. `Soon as the woods on shore look dim, We 'll sing at St Ann's our parting hymn; Row, brothers, row—the stream runs fast, The rapids are near, and the daylight 's past.' Night had now closed around us, and for two or three hours we made so little progress, that we began to fear we should be obliged to remain on board all night. We wished to be put ashore at Point St Clair, but the captain said the shoals were dangerous, and he did not like to venture. We were soon however relieved from our apprehensions, as the wind again rose, and a stiff breeze wafted us swiftly onward. It was a bright starlight night; not a cloud was visible on the stainless azure above us, and the dancing waves beneath sparkled with the reflected glories of the heavens. Lights were seen along the shore, and now and then showed us a small village or solitary cottage in the midst of surrounding gloom. Judge Macdonald sang several Highland songs in Gaelic. His voice was rich and well modulated, and there was a wild sweetness in the airs that well accorded with the time and place. The captain and mate held repeated consultations respecting the situation of La Chine. We found they had entirely mistaken it, and there were some on board who thought we had passed it. Poor M., whose head still continued to ache, fancied we were approaching the La Chine rapids, and even declared she could hear their roar. We afterwards found that stouter hearts among us, had entertained the same fear. About midnight, however, we entered the desired haven and in a few minutes were comfortably established for the night in a neat tavern. We rose at six the next morning, and after a pleasant ride of nine miles, reached the good and loyal city of Montreal with keen appetites for breakfast. Our friends had all arrived on the preceding evening, and we soon after met to discuss our various adventures. THE ANNOYER. BY N. P. WILLIS. Sogna il guerriér le schiere, Le selve il cacciatór; E sogna il pescatór Le reti, e l' amo. METASTASIO. Love knoweth every form of air, And every shape of earth, And comes, unbidden, everywhere, Like thought's mysterious birth. The moonlight sea and the sunset sky Are written with Love's words, And you hear his voice unceasingly, Like song in the time of birds. He peeps into the warrior's heart From the tip of a stooping plume, And the serried spears, and the many men May not deny him room. He 'll come to his tent in the weary night, And be busy in his dream; And he 'll float to his eye in morning light Like a fay on a silver beam. He hears the sound of the hunter's gun, And rides on the echo back, And sighs in his ear like a stirring leaf, And flits in his woodland track. The shade of the wood, and the sheen of the river, The cloud, and the open sky— He will haunt them all with his subtle quiver, Like the light of your very eye. The fisher hangs over the leaning boat, And ponders the silver sea, For Love is under the surface hid, And a spell of thought has he. He heaves the wave like a bosom sweet, And speaks in the ripple low, Till the bait is gone from the crafty line, And the hook hangs bare below. He blurs the print of the scholar's book, And intrudes in the maiden's prayer, And profanes the cell of the holy man, In the shape of a lady fair. In the darkest night, and the bright daylight, In earth, and sea, and sky, In every home of human thought, Will Love be lurking nigh. THE GRAVE OF AN UNKNOWN GENIUS. BY JOSEPH H. NICHOLS. How peacefully yon winding brook Along the cemetery flows, As if its waters paused to look Where sleep the dead in household rows. Wild lilies fringe its wayward path, And lean upon each mouldering tomb; But round one spot the verdure hath A richer and a fresher bloom. And softer by the wind hath gone, While, by the parting sunset flame, I clear the long grass from the stone, To trace the epitaph and name— And well those flowers may freshlier blow, The low wind hush its whispering tongue; For he who slumbereth below Was gifted with the fire of song. That name! how much it tells of one Whose mind, though bright with glorious rays Direct from heaven, yet beamed unknown, Nor drew the world's enchanted gaze; Who, far above men's winning art, Their fame and fortunes to exalt, Would never bow his noble heart— Excess of honor was his fault. I knew him well, when hoary age Had blanched his locks, and, by the hearth, Have often bent to hear the sage Floods of wild eloquence pour forth. And while in visionary trance His rapid numbers smoothly rolled, He seemed, in voice and countenance, Inspired as were the bards of old. And worthy of their harps was he— Worthy to wake, with them, the grand War anthem, or the music free Of love, with burning lip and hand, But silently he passed away, Like thought unuttered, and his lyre Was hushed, till angel hands should play The notes immortal themes inspire. Yet it is sweet, 't is passing sweet, When living, our own praise to hear, And see, in raptures, at our feet, Woman, the genius worshipper; And feel and know that, after death, The great, the beautiful, and brave, Will come to hang the laurel wreath, And drop a tear upon our grave. Grave of an unknown Genius!—blest Be the cold pillow of his sleep— Still may strange visions gild his rest, Like those which nightly used to sweep Around his couch, in radiance Immortal, when, though sealed, his eyes, With fancy's telescopic glance, Pierced the blue curtain of the skies, And saw, as in a mystic glass, Pictures of woods and amber streams, In twilight, classic vistas pass, And caught celestial tinted gleams Of fair faced daughters, whose bright hair Like robes of sunlight round them hung, And bathed their ivory bodies there, While back his rapturous gaze they flung. Voices and viols, too, from high, Came stealing to his ravished ear, In cadences of ecstacy, So sweet, 't were almost death to hear; And secrets of the other world, The orbs, and those who in them dwell, Were, like a burning scroll, unfurled, And told what mortal might not tell. Nature, not less, with day dreams true Of living joys, oft thrilled his frame; From every passing hour he drew Deep lessons, as in glory came Spring with its silver sea of flowers, Summer's majestic thunder cloud, Gorgeous autumn's hectic hours, And winter's universal shroud. Born with a shape of kingly mould, An eye, where light ethereal flashed, A brow of marble, high and bold, That vulgar minds with awe abashed— Why, from yon lonely poplar vale, Where smiled his cottage through the trees, Came forth no minstrel to regale The world with holy rhapsodies? Oh! all availed not. Still his lyre Hung silent to the world around; None, save the happy cherub choir Of heaven, were conscious of its sound— As angels oft view many a star, And catch its music's golden tone, While ray and song to mortals are Both undiscovered and unknown. A FOREST SCENE. BY H. PICKERING. Primeval shades! and ye, majestic woods, Implanted not by man, but from time's dawn Successive reared by an Almighty hand, O welcome to my soul! Your silence breathes Of peace; while from your inmost depths the voice Of Nature seems, in whisper soft, to say,— `These shadowy realms are all my own.' A scene How wild, how solemn, how magnificent! 'Mid these interminable columns, gray With the slow lapse of centuries, the eye Is lost; or when upraised, may strive in vain To penetrate the dense and leafy roof That like another firmament extends High over head. Even the sun's piercing beams Fall powerless here; and though they fire the heavens, The twilight of the woods they still refuse To dissipate. And then what stillness reigns! Not a leaf stirs; and the few living things Are motionless. Near where a moss clad trunk Extends its bulk immense along the earth, A solitary hare, with eye askance, Though silent and unmoved, is couched; the while At measured intervals, the hermit bird[2] [2] Turdus Solitarius. Breathes forth, in secret, its sweet, mournful note, Which dying, falls upon the ear, yet not Disturbs the deep serene. With voice subdued, I too pour out the promptings of my heart, And reverent tread the hallowed ground. O God! How all unworthy are the proudest fanes For thine exalted worship, when compared With temples such as this. Vainglorious man, Or in Ionic grace, or florid pomp Corinthian, or severer Doric pride, The marble fabric rears, and dedicates Ostensibly to thee, yet secret boasts His forming hand; but thy majestic works In silent grandeur rise, which heaven's bright hosts With awe behold, and hymn eternal praise. And shall not he thou fashionedst from the dust, And `with surpassing beauty crowned,' thy power Omnipotent confess, and grateful sound Through every land the sovereign truth, `Thou reignest?' Thou art—and were man's lips forever sealed, That truth immutable would be promulged. The earth, the invisible air, and the blue depths Of ocean, all evolve it; 't is inscribed In golden characters amid the stars; And every orb that rolls sublime, repeats This to the listening ear; but 'mid these shades It sinks with awe upon the heart. Once too, Ye feather-cinctured race, it fell on yours; And your stern souls, struck with religious dread, Prostrate even here, where now I stand, adored The one, Great Spirit! Be it not then said VOL. I. 9 That Nature her magnificence in vain Had lavished on the desert. Lakes immense, Like mirrors spread beneath the azure heavens— Rivers, 'mid thousand tributary streams, Rolling in tranquil majesty along— Sky-propping mountains, and impetuous floods Bounding from steep to steep into the vales— But more than all, the immeasurable wild Covering with leafy labyrinths and shade Mysterious the wide land—a faith sublime Instilled, and led the Indian up to God. Yet did he not refrain from murderous strife; But 'mid these glorious scenes, 'mid Nature's forms August—worthy themselves to be adored— Hath steeled his heart, and dyed with human gore The virgin earth. What wonder, when the sons Of polished Europe wage insatiate war, When they, the followers of the Prince of Peace, Cease not, malevolent, to betray, oppress, And slay their fellows, that the undaunted race, Who held a dubious empire o'er the wild, By latent foes encompassed should delight In mortal combat. O Almighty God! Hide me from scenes of carnage; temper thou Full soon, `man's inhumanity to man,' And fill my soul with pity for the oppressed. Nor be this all; O lead me oft to thee; Give me to wander 'mid these shady haunts, Henceforth retreats of peace; and with the inspired Of every age, as with the uncultured tribes Of nature, to adore thee in thy works, And in the grandeur and the beauty here, To view the type of a more glorious world. THE RAPIDS. Oh coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz! that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! As You Like It. Midnight on board a steam boat, a full moon, and a soft panorama of the shores of the St Lawrence gliding by like a vision! I thus assume the dramatic prerogative of introducing my readers at once to the scene of my story, and with the same time saving privilege I introduce my dramatis personæ, a gentleman and lady promenading the deck with the slow step so natural on a summer's night, when your company is agreeable. The lady leaned familiarly on the arm of her companion as they walked to and fro, sometimes looking at the moon, and sometimes at her pretty feet, as they stole out, one after the other, into the moonlight. She was a tall, queenly person, somewhat embonpoint, but extremely graceful. Her eye was of a dark blue, shaded with lashes of remarkable length, and her features, though irregular, were expressive of great vivacity, and more than ordinary talent. She wore her hair, which was of a deep chestnut, in the Madonna style, simply parted, and her dress, throughout, had the chaste elegance of good taste—the tournure of fashion without its extravagance. Her companion was a tall, well formed young man, very handsome, with a frank and prepossessing expression of countenance, and the fine freedom of step and air, which characterize the well bred gentleman. He was dressed fashionably, but plainly, and wore whiskers, in compliance with the prevailing mania. His tone was one of rare depth and melody; and as he bent slightly and gracefully to the lady's ear, its low, rich tenderness had the irresistible fascination, for which the human voice is sometimes so remarkable. It was a beautiful night. The light lay sleeping on the St Lawrence like a white mist. The boat, on whose deck our acquaintances were promenading, was threading the serpentine channel of the `Thousand Isles,' more like winding through a wilderness than following the passage of a great river. The many thousand islands clustered in this part of the St Lawrence seem to realize the mad girl's dream when she visited the stars, and found them `—only green islands, sown thick in the sky.' Nothing can be more like fairy land than sailing among them on a summer's evening. They vary in size, from a quarter of a mile in circumference, to a spot just large enough for one solitary tree, and are at different distances, from a bowshot to a gallant leap from each other. The universal formation is a rock of horizontal stratum, and the river, though spread into a lake by innumerable divisions, is almost embowered by the luxuriant vegetation which covers them. There is everywhere sufficient depth for the boat to run directly alongside, and with the rapidity and quietness of her motion, and the near neighborhood of the trees, which may almost be touched, the illusion of aerial carriage over land, is, at first, almost perfect. The passage through the more intricate parts of the channel, is, if possible, still more beautiful. You shoot into narrow passes where you could spring on shore on either side, catching, as you advance, hasty views to the right and left, through long vistas of islands; or, running round a projecting point of rock or woodland, open into an apparent lake, and darting rapidly across, seem running right on shore as you enter a narrow strait in pursuit of the covert channel. It is the finest ground in the world for the `magic of moonlight.' The water is clear, and, on the night we speak of, was a perfect mirror. Every star was repeated. The foliage of the islands was softened into indistinctness, and they lay in the water, with their well defined shadows hanging darkly beneath them, as distinctly as clouds in the sky, and apparently as moveable. In more terrestrial company than the lady Viola's, our hero might have fancied himself in the regions of upper air; but as he leant over the tafferel, and listened to the sweetest voice that ever melted into moonlight, and watched the shadows of the dipping trees as the approach of the boat broke them one by one, he would have thought twice before he had said that he was sailing on a fresh water river, in the good steam boat Queenston. Miss Viola Clay and Mr Frank Gresham, the hero and heroine of this true story, I should have told you before, were cousins. They had met lately after a separation of many years, and as the lady had in the mean time become the proudest woman in the world, and the gentleman had been abroad and wore whiskers, and had, besides, a cousin's carte blanche for his visits, there was reason to believe they would become very well acquainted. Frank had been at home but a few months when he was invited to join the party with which he was now making the fashionable tour. He had seen Viola every day since his return, and had more to say to her than to all the rest of his relatives together. He would sit for hours with her in the deep recesses of the windows, 9* telling his adventures when abroad. At least, it was so presumed, as he talked all the time, and she was profoundly attentive. It was thought, too, he must have seen some affecting sights, for now and then his descriptions made her sigh audibly, and once the color was observed to mount to her very temples—doubtless from strong sympathy with some touching distress. Frank joined the party for the tour, and had, at the time we speak of, been several weeks in their company. They had spent nearly a month among the Lakes, and were now descending by their grand outlet to Montreal. Many a long walk had been taken, and many a romantic scene had been gazed upon during their absence, and the lady had, many a time, wandered away with her cousin, doubtless for the want of a more agreeable companion. She was indefatigable in seeing the celebrated places from every point, and made excursions which the gouty feet of her father, or the etiquette of a stranger's attendance would have forbidden. In these cases Frank's company was evidently a convenience; and over hill and dale, through glen and cavern, he had borne her delicate arm by the precious privilege of cousinship. There's nothing like a cousin. It is the sweetest relation in human nature. There is no excitement in loving your sister, and courting a lady in the face of a strange family requires the nerve of a martyr; but your dear familiar cousin, with her provoking maidenly reserve, and her bewitching freedoms, and the romping frolics, and the stolen tenderness over the skein of silk that will get tangled—and then the long rides which nobody talks about, and the long tête-à-têtes which are nobody's business, and the long letters of which nobody pays the postage—no, there is nothing like a cousin— a young, gay, beautiful witch of a cousin! Till within a few days Frank had enjoyed a monopoly of the lady Viola's condescensions; but their party had been increased lately by a young gentleman who introduced himself to papa as the son of an old friend, and proceeded immediately to a degree of especial attention which relieved our hero exceedingly of his duties. Mr Erastus Van Pelt was a tall, thin person with an aquiline nose, and a forehead that retreated till it was lost in the distance. It was evident at the first glance that he was high ton. The authenticity of his style, even on board a steam boat, distanced imitation immeasurably. The angle of his bow had been an insoluble problem from his début at the dancing school till the present moment, and his quizzing glass was thrown up to his eye with a grace that would have put Brummel to the blush. From the square toe of his pump to the loop of his gold chain he was a perfect wonder. Every body smiled on Mr Erastus Van Pelt. This accomplished gentleman looked with an evil eye on our hero. He had the magnanimity not to cut him outright, as he was the lady's cousin; but tolerated him on the first day with a cold civility, which he intended should amount to a cut on the second. Frank thought him thus far very amusing; but when he came frequently in the way of his attentions to his cousin, and once or twice raised his glass at his remarks, with the uncomprehending `Sir!' he was observed to stroke his black whiskers with a very ominous impatience. Further acquaintance by no means mended the matter, and Frank's brow grew more and more cloudy. He had already alarmed Mr Van Pelt with a glance of his eye that could not be mistaken, and anticipated his `cut direct' by at least some hours, when the lady Viola took him aside and bound over his thumb and finger to keep the peace toward the invisible waist of his adversary. A morning or two after this precaution, the boat was bending in toward a small village which terminates the safe navigation above the rapids of the Split Rock. Coaches were waiting on shore, to convey passengers to the next still water, and the mixed population of the little village, attracted by the arrival, was gathered in a picturesque group on the landing. There was the Italian looking Canadian with his clear olive complexion and open neck, his hat slouched carelessly, and the indispensable red sash hanging from his waist; and the still, statue like Indian with the incongruous blanket and belt, hat and moccasin costume of the border, and the tall, inquisitive looking Vermontese—all mingled together like the figures of a painter's study. Miss Clay sat on the deck, surrounded by her party. Frank, at a little distance, stood looking into the water with the grave intentness of a statue, and Mr Van Pelt levelled his glass at the `horrid creatures' on shore, and expressed his elegant abhorrence of their savaugerie in a fine spun falsetto. As its last thin tone melted, he turned and spoke to the lady with an air evidently more familiar than her dignity for the few first days seemed to have warranted. There was an expression of ill concealed triumph in his look, and an uncompromised turning of his back on our penseroso, which indicated an advance in relative importance; and though Miss Clay went on with the destruction of her card of distances just as if there was nobody in the world but herself, the conversation was well sustained till the last musical superlative was curtailed by the whiz of the escape valve. As the boat touched the pier, Frank awoke from his reverie, and announced his intention of taking a boat down the rapids. Viola objected to it at first as a dangerous experiment; but when assured by him that it was perfectly safe, and that the boat, during the whole passage, would be visible from the coach, she opposed it no further. Frank then turned to Mr Van Pelt, and to her astonishment, politely requested his company. The dandy was thunderstruck. To his comprehension it was like offering him a private interview with a bear. `No, sir,' said he, with a nervous twirl of his glass round his forefinger. Miss Clay, however, insisted on his acceptance of the invitation. The prospect of his company without the restraint of Frank's presence, and a wish to foster the good feeling from which she thought the offer proceeded, were sufficient reasons for perseverance, and on the ground that his beautiful cap was indispensable to the picturesque effect, she would take no denial. Most reluctantly his consent was at last given, and Frank sprang on shore with an accommodating readiness to find boatmen for the enterprise. He found his errand a difficult one. The water was uncommonly low, and at such times the rapids are seldom passed, even by the most daring. The old voyageurs received his proposition with shrugs and volumes of patois, in which he could only distinguish adjectives of terror. By promises of extravagant remuneration, however, he prevailed on four athletic Canadians to row him to Coteau du Lac. He then took them aside, and by dint of gesture and bad French, made them comprehend, that he wished to throw his companion into the river. They had no shadow of objection. For a `consideration,' they would upset the bateau in a convenient place below the rapids, and ensure Mr Van Pelt's subsequent existence at the forfeiture of the reward. A simultaneous `Gardez vous!' was to be the signal for action. The coaches had already started when Frank again stood on the pier, and were pursuing slowly the beautiful road on the bank of the river. He almost repented his rash determination for a moment, but the succeeding thought was one of pride, and he sprang lightly into the bateau at the `Allons!' of the impatient boatmen. Mr Van Pelt was already seated, and as they darted rapidly away with the first stroke of the oars, the voyageur at the helm commenced a low recitative. At every alternate line, the others joined in a loud, but not inharmonious chorus, and the strokes were light or deep as the leader indicated, by his tone, the necessity of rapidity or deliberation. In a few minutes they reached the tide, and as the boat swept violently in, the oars were shipped, and the boatmen, crossing themselves and mumbling a prayer to the saint, sat still, and looked anxiously forward. It was evidently much worse than Mr Van Pelt had anticipated. Frank remarked upon the natural beauties of the river, but he had no eye for scenery. He sat on a low seat, grasping the sides of the boat with a tenacity as unphilosophical as it was out of character for his delicate fingers. The bateau glided like a bird round the island which divides the river, and, steering for the middle of the stream, was in a moment, hurrying with its whole velocity onward. The Split Rock was as yet far below, but the intermediate distance was a succession of rapids, and, though not much dreaded by those accustomed to the navigation, they were to a stranger sufficiently appalling. The river was tossed like a stormy sea, and the large waves, thrown up from the sunken rocks, came rolling back upon the tide, and, dashing over the boat, flung her off like a tiny shell. Mr Van Pelt was in a profuse perspiration. His knees, drawn up to his head by the acute angle of his posture, knocked violently together, and no persuasion could induce him to sit in the depressed stern for the accommodation of the voyageurs. He sat right in the centre of the bateau, and kept his eye on the waves with a manifest distrust of Providence, and an anxiety that betrayed a culpable want of resignation. The bateau passed the travellers on shore as she neared the rock. Frank waved his handkerchief triumphantly. The water just ahead roared and leaped up in white masses like a thousand monsters; and, at the first violent whirl, he was pulled down by a voyageur, and commanded imperatively to lie still. Another and another shock followed in quick succession, and she was perfectly unmanageable. The helmsman threw himself flat on the bottom. Mr Van Pelt hid his face in his hands, and crouched beside him. The water dashed in, and the bateau, obeying every impulse, whirled and flung from side to side like a feather. It seemed as if every plunge must be the last. One moment she shivered and stood motionless, struck back by a violent blow, and the next, shot down into an abyss with an arrowy velocity that seemed like instant destruction. Frank shook off the grasp of the voyageur, and, holding on to the side, half rose to his feet. `Gardez vous!' exclaimed the voyageur; and, mistaking the caution for the signal, with a sudden effort he seized Mr Van Pelt, and, plunging him over the side, leaped in after him. `Diable!' muttered the helmsman, as the dandy, with a piercing shriek, sprang half out of water, and disappeared instantly. But the Split Rock was right beneath the bow, and like a shot arrow the boat sprang through the gorge, and in a moment was gliding among the masses of foam in the smooth water. They put back immediately, and at a stroke or two against the current, up came the scientific `brutus' of Mr Van Pelt, quite out of curl, and crested with the foam through which he had emerged to a thinner element. There was no mistaking its identity, and it was rudely seized by the voyageur with a tolerable certainty that the ordinary sequel would follow. All reasoning upon anomalies, however, is uncertain, and to the terror of the unlettered captor, down went un gentilhomme, leaving the envy of the world in his possession. He soon reappeared, and with his faith in the unity of Monsieur considerably shaken, the voyageur lifted him carefully into the bateau. My dear reader! were you ever sick? Did you have a sweet cousin, or a young aunt, or any pretty friend who was not your sister or your mother, for a nurse? And do you remember how like an angel's fingers, her small white hand laid on your forehead, and how thrillingly her soft voice spoke low in your ear, and how inquiringly her fair face hung over your pillow? If you have not, and remember no such passages, it were worth half your sound constitution, and half your uninteresting health, and half your long life, to have had that experience. Talk of moonlight in a bower, and poetry in a boudoir—there is no atmosphere for love like a sick chamber, and no poetry like the persuasion to your gruel, or the sympathy for your aching head, or your feverish forehead. Three months after Frank Gresham was taken out of the St Lawrence, he was sitting in a deep recess with the lady, who, to the astonishment of the whole world, had accepted him as her lover. `Miss Viola Clay,' said our hero with a look of profound resignation, `when will it please you to attend to certain responses you wot of?' The answer was in a low sweet tone, inaudible to all save the ear for which it was intended. THE NOTES OF OUR BIRDS. BY I. M'LELLAN. Well do I love those various harmonies That ring so gaily in spring's budding woods, And in the thickets, and green, quiet haunts, And lonely copses of the summer time, And in red autumn's ancient solitudes. If thou art pained with the world's noisy stir Or crazed with its mad tumults, and weighed down With any of the ills of human life, If thou art sick and weak, or mournest at the loss Of brethren gone to that far distant land To which we all do pass, gentle and poor, The gayest and the gravest, all alike— Then turn into the peaceful woods, and hear The thrilling music of the forest birds. How rich the varied choir!—the unquiet finch Calls from the distant hollows, and the wren Uttereth her sweet and mellow plaint at times, And the thrush mourneth where the kalmia hangs Its crimson spotted cups, or chirps half hid Amid the lowly dog wood's snowy flowers, And the blue jay flits by, from tree to tree, And spreading its rich pinions, fills the ear With its shrill sounding and unsteady cry. With the sweet airs of spring, the robin comes And in her simple song there seems to gush A strain of sorrow when she visiteth VOL. I. 10 Her last year's withered nest. But when the gloom Of the deep twilight falls, she takes her perch Upon the red stemmed hazel's slender twig That overhangs the brook, and suits her song To the slow rivulet's inconstant chime. In the last days of autumn, when the corn Lies sweet and yellow in the harvest field, And the loud company of reapers bind The bearded wheat in sheaves, then peals abroad The blackbird's merry chant. I love to hear, Bold plunderer! the mellow burst of song Float from thy watch place on the mossy tree Close at the corn field edge. Lone whippoorwill! There is much sweetness in thy fitful hymn, Heard in the drowsy watches of the night. Ofttimes when all the village lights are out And the wide air is still, I hear thee chant Thy hollow dirge, like some recluse who takes His lodging in the wilderness of woods, And lifts his anthem when the world is still; And the dim, solemn night, that brings to man And to the herds deep slumbers, and sweet dews To the red roses and the herbs, doth find No eye save thine a watcher in her halls. I hear thee oft at midnight, when the thrush And the green roving linnet are at rest, And the blithe, twittering swallows have long ceased Their noisy note, and folded up their wings. Far up some brook's still course, whose current mines The forest's blackened roots, and whose green marge Is seldom visited by human foot, The lonely heron sits, and ofttimes breaks The sabbath silence of the wilderness. And you may find her by some reedy pool, Or brooding gloomily on the time stained rock, Beside some misty and far reaching lake. Most awful is thy deep and heavy boom, Gray watcher of the waters! Thou art king Of the blue lake, and all the winged kind Do fear the echo of thine angry cry. How bright thy savage eye! Thou lookest down And read'st the secrets of the moveless deep, And seest the shining fishes as they glide; And poising thy gray wing, thy glossy beak Swift as an arrow strikes its roving prey. Ofttimes I see thee through the curling mist Dart like a spectre of the night, and hear Thy strange bewildering call, like to the scream Of one whose life is perishing in the sea. And I have seen thee, hermit bird! lift up Thine iron pinion, and forsake thy green And lowly nest among the drooping sedge, To battle with the eagle of the air. Methought I heard thy struggling pinions clash In the broad heavens, and thy throat send out Thy bold defiance to thy savage foe. And now, wouldst thou, O man! delight the ear With earth's delicious sounds, or charm the eye With beautiful creations? Then pass forth And find them midst those manycolored birds That crowd the sunny woods. The richest hues Lie in their splendid plumage, and their tones Are sweeter than the music of the lute, Or the harp's melody, or the notes that gush So thrillingly from beauty's ruby lip. MERE ACCIDENT. BY N. P. WILLIS. It was a shady nook that I had found Deep in the greenwood. A delicious stream Ran softly by it on a bed of grass, And to the border leant a sloping bank Of moss as delicate as Tempe e'er Spread for the sleep of Io. Overhead The spreading larch was woven with the fir, And as the summer wind stole listlessly, And dallied with the tree tops, they would part And let in sprinklings of the sunny light, Studding the moss like silver; and again Returning to their places, there would come A murmur from the touched and stirring leaves, That like a far off instrument, beguiled Your mood into the idleness of sleep. Here did I win thee, Viola! We came— Thou knowest how carelessly—and never thought Love lived in such a wilderness; and thou— I had a cousin's kindness for thy lip, And in the meshes of thy chestnut hair I loved to hide my fingers—that was all! And when I saw thy figure on the grass, And thy straw bonnet flung aside, I thought A fairy would be pretty painted so, Upon a ground of green—but that was all! And when thou playfully wouldst bathe thy foot, And the clear water of the stream ran off And left the white skin polished, why, I thought It looked like ivory—but that was all! And when thou wouldst be serious, and I Was serious too, and thy mere fairy's hand Lay carelessly in mine, and just for thought I mused upon thy innocence, and gazed Upon the pure transparence of thy brow— I pressed thy fingers half unconsciously, And fell in love. Was that all, Viola? VERMONT. Somewhere out of the world, and in Vermont. TOKEN. `This is a strange world,' said a friend, laying down the Token. `Your remark is more true than original,' I replied. `The mass of moving and intelligent beings who compose the world are strange enough, no doubt. The world, of itself—I mean this planet on which we dwell—is most beautiful and perfect; but the word has many different meanings. To the fashionable, Washington, New York, and Saratoga, are the world; and provided that is not quite large enough, fashion makes the world extend to Niagara, and down the St Lawrence. Sometimes a man's home is his world, and occasionally the world is his home; and sometimes, too, there may be a poor wretch who has no home in the world.' `I care not for your explanations and definitions,' said my friend; `here is a work professing to be purely American—and there are many others—and yet there is no end to the slanders which are cast upon one of the New England States. Is a place out of the world, that is, out of all worlds—it is sure to be in Vermont. 10* Does a man four feet broad and seven feet high appear in the “Bay State”—he is said to be “from Vermont.” “Ah yes! from Vermont,” lisps a dandy, four feet and three inches in length; “quite a promising young man.” Is a student awkward, ungainly, and unmannerly—“You would think,” say his fellow students, “he came from Vermont.” Does a young Vermonter gaze with rapture upon a fine landscape—“No wonder,” is the exclamation, “he never saw anything but pine trees before.” Does he dwell with still more intense admiration on the fair face of beauty—“Why, he is only enchanted by the novelty of a white forehead and red cheek; everybody knows the faces of Vermont girls are the color of a Swedish turnip.” Has a woman a great ancle—“She is a native of Vermont—a small town,” says a reigning belle, “on Lake Superior. I have always understood lake air was injurious. When my father and I went there, I persuaded him to entrust his affairs to an agent, and hurry away as fast as possible; for I believe my foot and ancle increased the third part of an inch the two days we were obliged to remain in that out of the way place.”—“My son is very unfortunate,” sighs an elderly lady;—“I have been very much distressed on his account.” “Has anything in particular happened, madam, to cause so much anxiety? Allow me to hope it may be in my power to relieve you.” Still the lady sobbed and wrung her hands, and, as I gathered in the intervals of her sorrow, her son lived in Vermont! Poor young man! doomed by the necessities of business, and the sad prospect of making a large fortune, to reside in a State where there is nothing but bears and pumpkins! She felt for him sincerely—deeply— nothing but a wilderness—no society, except here and there a family in a log house! This young man, however, finds his property increasing, and his prospects good in every respect. He engages himself to a lovely girl; and when he speaks of the time when her dignity and virtues will grace his quiet home—“Impossible!” she replies; “would you expose me to all the trials and dangers of a life in Vermont?” He reasons and expostulates to no effect; and then, in the plenitude of his wisdom, removes to the city, because his wife cannot live in Vermont! “Poor Mary!” exclaim her friends, “she has been used to comforts and delicacies, and it would not be right to deprive her of them.” And so he lays down his independence and his good judgment, at the shrine of a woman's whim. `In faith I desire no worse punishment, than to be the owner of such rich tracts of country as this State presents—fertile, cultivated, and most romantic. I would sooner be a dweller in some of its towns bordering on the Connecticut, or those rich vallies that bound its western frontier, than to revel in all the luxuries which belong to the most boasted cities. There is no higher enjoyment, which is connected with anything earthly, than to watch the changing beauty of its landscapes. Many are the hours I have stood upon yonder eminence, and marked the beams of the descending sun upon the plains, the river, and its villages, gradually shadowing the hills, till the topmost boughs of the tall fir trees were the only objects which received its parting glory. That passed away, and the light mist curled upon its brow, flinging its fantastic wreaths over tree and rock, till it reposed in one dense mass upon mountain and plain. Then the moon arose, and shone upon this moving lake, till it seemed to smile and dimple in its clear beauty.' `Upon my word!' I exclaimed, `here is a description, and from you!' `From me? Am I not a native of Vermont, and have not my fathers long dwelt here? They were honorable and wise, and it is the sarcastic smile which plays upon the lip, when my State is mentioned, which rouses my pride. “Oh! nobody knows where—up in Vermont!”' `But you should remember such sarcasms are from the ignorant.' `A very just remark! Everybody is ignorant when Vermont is mentioned.' `Pardon me,' I replied, `for again alluding to the subject. You have convinced me there is fine scenery in your State, but I have heard nothing with regard to your men and women.' `As it respects the former,' my friend replied with a serious air, `I cannot perhaps be a correct judge. Many years since there was a circle of gentlemen, whose united worth, talents, and graceful address, made them the delight of a much more extended circle than their own; and who are remembered, for but few of them remain, as constituting a school of wisdom and politeness, now comparatively forgotten. They were thrown together in times of public excitement, and their actions and writings remain, to prove their patriotism and genius. I have often wished,' he added, `that their lives and private virtues were made the subject of something more than a passing notice. At present many of our young men seek distant States, for the display of talent, or the acquirement of wealth; but it may be truly said of those who remain, that no section of our country can boast of a class of men of purer morals or better energies. The claims of hospitality are understood in every grade of society; and I am well assured, if there is a reading and thinking population in any part of America, that population is to be found in the slandered State of Vermont.' `But the ancles of her ladies—surely you have not come to a conclusion, with this part of the argument untouched?' `As to that,' said my friend, `there is proportion in the character and persons of my fair State's women; and proportion is beauty.' THE NUN. BY EMMA C. MANLY. She was very fair, And intellect had poured its richest light Upon her nature; but, alas for her! She had a woman's heart, and Love too soon Twined his light fetters round her spirit's wing, Binding it down to earth. Her life had been Like a calm summer's day, and she had dreamed Its hours away 'mid those sweet fantasies That youthful feeling loves. No threatening cloud Had darkened her pure heaven of sinless thought. She looked on all things with the loving eye Of happy innocence, and her sweet voice Was like the carol of young birds in spring, The echo of a glad and joyous heart. Alas! alas! that grief should enter here! But never yet was gentle woman led By intellect to happiness. The light Of genius serves but to illume the waste Of blighted hope, and she who rashly fans The sacred flame, like the poor Hindoo wife, Lights her own funeral pyre. Ay, Aline loved As the heart loves in youth—as women love In every season. Genius, beauty, all That man can prize, or woman boast, were given As offerings to one deity. She lived But in his presence. Absence was to her The soul's deep midnight; for he was the sun Of her bright world of dreams, and her young heart, Like Memnon's harp, beneath his eyes alone Gave out its hidden music. It was deep, Intense devotion, pure as infancy, Yet strong as death, which dwelt within her breast. A life of tenderness would scarce repay Such self-forgetting love. But, ah! the lot Of woman was upon her, and she met A woman's recompense. The time had come For their first parting now, and days passed on; Yet bright anticipations filled her heart, And she was happy. But long weeks and months Rolled by, and yet he came not. Then the rose Faded from Aline's cheek; yet she was calm; And, though her lip grew paler, it still wore Its quiet smile; but, oh! what eye could trace The daily withering of her heart, the slow Protracted martyrdom of hope? At length They told her he was married! No reproach Broke from her lips, but meekly, like a flower, She sunk beneath the blow. The heavy hand Of sickness fell upon her, and she prayed To leave a scene of suffering and of sin. But death came not; and, when the healthful flow Of life's pure current came again, she turned From all her former joys, and found her home Within a convent's walls. When I first saw her, five long years had past, And peace once more dwelt in her heart. Her cheek Was pale as marble, and her features wore The settled calmness of a spirit schooled By early suffering. The fierce storm had past, But left its trace of desolation. Time Had done his kindly work, and she could smile Once more with cheerfulness; but, when she spoke Of earlier days, a soft and dewy light Shone in her dovelike eyes, as if a tear Had burst from its sealed fountain. ROMANCE IN REAL LIFE. BY THE AUTHOR OF `REDWOOD.' `La Nature fait le mérite, La Fortune le met en preuve.' Many fortunate travellers on the western border of Massachusetts, and not many miles from the Hudson, have been refreshed at the inn of Reliance Reynolds. Reliance, as his name indicates, was born in the good old times. We are aware that the enthusiasts about the `progress of the age,' deny this golden period any but a retrospective existence, and maintain that, retrace the steps of the human family far as you will, it is like the age of chivalry, always a little behind you. But we adhere to the popular phraseolgy and call those, `good old times,' when the Puritanical nomenclature prevailed; when such modest graces as faith and temperance had not been expelled from our taverns, kitchens, and workshops, by the heroes and heroines of romance—the Orlandos and Lorenzos, Rosamonds and Anna Matildas. Reliance belonged to the `good old times,' too, in the more essential matter of downright honesty, simplicity, and respectful courtesy. His was a rare character in New England—a passive spirit, content to fill and fit the niche nature had prepared for him. It was not very high, but he never aspired above it; nor very low, but he never sank below it. He was the marvel of his neighbours, for he could never be persuaded into an enterprise, or speculation. He never bought a water privilege, nor an oar bed; subscribed to a county bank, or `moved to the West;' or in any mode indicated that principle in man, which, in its humble operations, is restlessness, in its lofty aspirations, a longing after immortality. Reliance's desires never passed the bounds of his premises, and were satisfied, even within them, with a very moderate share of power. He stood at his door, his hat in his hand, to receive his guests; he strictly performed the promise of his sign, and gave `good entertainment to man and horse;' he rendered a moderate bill and received his dues with a complacent smile, in which gratitude was properly tempered with a just sense of his own rights. In short, as must be already quite manifest, Reliance, though a pattern landlord, is a very poor subject for a storyteller; his qualities, like the colors in a ray of light, all blending and forming one hue, and his life, presenting the same monotonous harmony. We should not have forced him from his happy obscurity into the small degree of notoriety he may incur on our humble page, but for his being the adjunct of his wife, an important personage in our narrative. Mrs Reynolds, too, like her husband, performed exactly the duties of her station. She never perhaps read a line of poetry, save such as might lurk in the `Poet's Corner' of a village paper, but her whole life was an illustration of the oldfashioned couplet— `Honor and shame from no condition rise, Act well your part, there all the honor lies.' She never was presidentess of a `society for ameliorating the condition of the Jews,' or secretary or treasurer of any of those beneficent associations that rescue the latent talents of women from obscurity and mettrent en scéne gems and flowers that might otherwise shine and exhale unnoticed and unknown; but though humble was her name and destiny, her memory is dear to the wayfaring. Quiet, order, and neatness, reigned at her bed and board. No pirates harbored in her bedsteads, no bad luck, that evil genius of housewives, curdled her cream, spoiled her butter or her bread, but her table was spread with such simple, wholesome fare as might have lit a smile on the wan visage of an old dispeptic; and this we take to be the greatest achievement of the gastronomic art. With the duties of life so peacefully and so well performed, our good hostess ought, according to all the rules of happiness, to have been happy; but it is our melancholy duty to confess she was not, and to explain the cause. She had been married many years without having any children; that blessed possession that in transmitting, the parents' existence, seems to extend its bounds, and to render even here, the mortal immortal. In addition to the feeling, common to all women, who naturally crave the sweetest objects for their tenderest and strongest affections, Mrs Reynolds lamented her childless state with a bitterness of repining approaching to that of the Hebrew wives. With everything else in her possession that could inspire contentment, her mind was fixed on this one desired good, and, like Hannah of old, she was still a `woman of a sorrowful spirit.' She had endeavoured to solace herself with the children of her kindred, and several, from time to time, had been adopted into her family; but some proved disagreeable, and others homesick, and there was always a paramount duty or affection that interfered with her's, till finally her VOL. I. 11 almost extinguished hopes were gratified, and Providence gave her a child worthy all her care and love.[3] [3] We would gladly have had it in our power to be exact in dates, as our story in good faith is true in all, even the least important particulars. Some few circumstances, and the `spoken words,' had escaped tradition, and of course were necessarily supplied, as the proper statue receives a foot or finger from the ruder hand of modern art. The name of the heroine having been subsequently merged and forgotten in that of her husband, we have ventured to retain it. The rest we have respectfully veiled under assumed appellations. In the autumn of 1777, two travellers arrived just at nightfall at Reynold's inn. Its aspect was inviting; situated in the heart of a fertile valley that had lately been refreshed by the early rains of autumn, and in its bright garb resembling a mature beauty that had happily harmonized some youthful tints with her soberer graces. A sprightly, winding stream gave life and music to the meadows. On every side the landscape was undulating and fertile, but not then as extensively cultivated as now, when, to the Tauconnuc on the south, and the lofty blue outline of the Catskills on the west, the eye ranges over a rich and enjoyed country. Beside the accidental charm of a pretty landscape, the inn had advantages peculiar to itself. Instead of being placed on the roadside, as most of our taverns are—for what reason we know not, unless a cloud of travellers' dust be typical of a shower of gold to the vision of mine host— Reynolds's inn was separated from the highway by a court yard, shaded by two wide spreading elms, and enlivened with a profusion of autumnal flowers, marigolds, cockscombs, and china asters. There was nothing that indicated any claims to particular civility in the appearance of our travellers. They were well looking and respectably apparelled; and, accordingly, having announced their determination to remain for the night, they were shown to an inner room, the parlour, par excellence, where Mrs Reynolds appeared, and having opened a door which admitted the balmy air and a view of the western sky, just then brightened by the tints of the setting sun, she received their orders for their supper, and retired without one of those remarks or inquiries by which it is usual, on such occasions to give vent to curiosity. Nothing passed between our travellers in the dull interval that elapsed before their meal was ready, to give to our readers the least clue to their origin or destiny. One of them lulled himself into a doze in the rocking chair, while the other, younger and more active and vivacious, amused himself out of doors, plucking flowers, enraging an old petulant cock turkey, and mocking the scolding of some Guinea hens, the Xantippes of the feathered race. The interval was not long. The door opened and the tea table was brought in, already spread (a mode we wish others would adopt from our pattern landlady), and spread in a manner to characterize our bountiful country. What a contrast does the evening meal of our humblest inn present to the leanness of an English tea table! A cornucopia would have been the appropriate symbol for Mrs Reynolds's table. There were beef steaks, and ham and eggs; hot cakes and toast; bread and gingerbread; all the indigenous cakes, such as crullers and nutcakes, &amp;c.; honey, sweetmeats, apple sauce, cheese, pickles, and an afterpiece of pies. Kind reader, do not condemn our bill of fare as impertinent and vulgar. We put it down to show the scared political economists, that, with us, instead of the population pressing on the means of subsistence, the means of subsistence presses on the population. Our travellers fell to their repast with appetites whetted by a long fast and a day's ride. Not a word was spoken, till a little girl, who was sitting on the doorstep caressing a tame pigeon, perceiving that one of the guests had garnished his buttonhole with a bunch of marigolds, plucked a rose from a monthly rose bush, trained over a trellis at the door, and laid it beside his plate. He seemed struck with the modest offering, and, turning with a look of gratitude to the child, he patted her on her head, and exclaimed instinctively, `Merci, merci, ma pelite!' and then correcting himself, he said, in very imperfect English, `I thank you, my little girl.' The child's attention was fixed by the first word he uttered, and as he addressed his companion in French, her countenance indicated more emotion than would naturally have been excited by the simple circumstance of hearing, for the first time, a foreign language. `Qu'elle est belle, cette petite,' he continued, turning to his companion; `c'est la beauté de mon pays—voilà, brunette, et les yeux, si grands, si noirs, et la tournure aussi—quelle grâce, quelle vivacilé! Ah! Monsieur, Monsieur, c'est tout-à-fait Françoise.' As he proceeded the child advanced nearer to him. She shook back the rich, dark curls that shaded her face, bent her head forward, half parted her bright lips, and listened with the uncertain and eager expression of one who is catching a half remembered tune, the key to a thousand awakening recollections. It was evident that she did not comprehend the purport of the words, and that it was the sound alone to which her delighted ear was stretched. A smile played about her lips, and tears gathered in her eyes, and there seemed to be a contrariety of emotions, confounding even to herself; but that which finally prevailed was indicated by her throwing her apron over her head, and retreating to the doorstep, where she sat down, and for some moments, vainly attempted to stifle her sobs. She had just become tranquil, when Mrs Reynolds entered. The elder traveller said, in an interrogating tone, `That is your child, ma'am?.' `I call her mine,' was the brief and not very satisfactory reply. `She resembles neither you nor your husband,' resumed the traveller. `No; she does not favor us.' `I fancied she had a French look.' `I can't say as to that,' replied the landlady; `I never saw any French people.' `My friend here is a Frenchman,' pursued the traveller, `and the little girl listened to him so intently, that I thought it possible she might understand him.' `No, I guess she did not sense him,' replied Mrs Reynolds, with an air of indifference; and then turning hastily to the child, `Mary,' she said, `there is more company; go and see if your father does not want you.' She went, and did not return. Mrs Reynolds herself removed the table. The elder gentleman sat down to write a letter; while the Frenchman walked to and fro, opened the doors, and peeped in every direction to get a glimpse of the little girl, who seemed to have taken complete possession of his imagination. Once, as she ran through the passage, he called to her, `Doucement! doucement! mon petit ange'—she stopped as if she were glued to the floor. `How call you your name, my dear?' `Mary Reynolds, sir.' `Then Madame there, Mistress Reynolds, is your maman?' `She is— 11* `Mary, what are you staying for? Here—this instant!' screamed Mrs Reynolds from the kitchen door, in a tone that admitted no delay, and the child ran off without finishing her sentence. `C'est bien singulier!' muttered the Frenchman. `What do you find so singular, Jaubert?' asked his companion, who had just finished his letter, and thrown down his pen. `Oh! it is nothing—perhaps—but—' “`But” what, my friend?' `Why, there seems to me some mystery about this child; something in her manner, I know not what, that stirs up strange thoughts and hopes in my mind. She is not one of the pale, blond beauties of your climate.' `Ah! my good friend, we have all sorts of beauties in our clime. All nations, you know, have sent us their contributions. The blue eye and fair skin, the Saxon traits, certainly prevail in our Eastern States; but you know we border on New York, the asylum of the dark eyed Huguenots, and it is not impossible that to this child may have been transmitted the peculiarities of some French ancestor. Nothing is more common than a resemblance between a descendant and a far off progenitor.' `Ah! it is not only the French, the Norman aspect, the—do not ridicule me—the Angely traits that attract me; but you yourself noticed how she listened to my language, and then this Mistress Reynolds does not say she is her child, but only she calls her so.' `Pshaw! Is that all? It is the way of my country people, Jaubert; their indirectness is proverbial. If one of them were to say “yes” or “no,” you might suspect some deep mystery. I confess I was at first startled with the little girl's emotion, but I soon perceived it was nothing but shame and embarrassment at the curiosity she had betrayed. I see how it is, Jaubert; fruitless and hopeless as is our search, you cannot bear to relinquish it, and are looking for some coup de théâtre— some sudden transition from disappointment to success.' We have put into plain English a conversation that was supported in French, and was now broken off by the approach of Mrs Reynolds, who came to tell the travellers their bedrooms were ready. By the light of the candle she brought, she discovered Mary, concealed in a corner of the passage close to the door, where, in breathless stillness, she had been listening. `You here, Mary!' exclaimed the good woman; `I thought you had been in bed this half hour. You will make me angry with you, Mary, if you do not mind me better than this,' she added in an under tone, and the child stole away, but without looking either very penitent or very fearful; and in truth she had cause for neither penitence nor fear, for she had only gratified an innocent and almost irrepressible inclination, and as to Dame Reynolds's anger, it was never formidable. The travellers retired to their respective apartments, and while the landlady lingered to adjust her parlour, the letter that had been left on the table caught her eye. Nothing could be more natural than for her to look at the superscription. Painfully she spelt out the first line. `A Monsieur, Monsieur'—but when she came to the next, her eye was rivetted, `St Jean Angely de CrèveCœur.' After gazing on it till she had made assurance doubly sure, she was hastening to her husband to participate the discovery with him, when, apparently changing her intentions, she retreated, bolted the door, and returned to the examination of the letter. It was unsealed. Reluctant to open it, she compromised with her conscience, and peeped in at both ends, but the writing was not perceptible, and her interest overcoming her scruples, she unfolded the letter. Alas! it was in French. In vain her eye ran over the manuscript to catch some words that might serve as clues to the rest. There was nothing in all the three pages she could comprehend, but `arrivé à New York'—`la rivière d' Hudson'—`le manoir de Livingston.' She was refolding the letter, when the following postscript, inadvertently written in English, caught her eye; `As we have no encouragement to proceed farther in our search, and Jean and Avenel are all impatience, Jaubert will embark in the Neptune, which is to sail on the first.' A gleam of pleasure shot across Mrs Reynolds's face, but it soon darkened again with anxiety and perplexity. `Why did I open the letter?' she asked herself. `Why did I look at it at all? But nobody will ever know that I have seen it unless I tell it myself; and why should I tell?' A burst of tears concluded this mental interrogation, and proved that, however earnestly her heart might plead before the tribunal of conscience, yet the stern decision of that unerring judge was heard. Self-interest has a hard task when it would mystify the path of one who habitually walks by the clear light of truth straight onward in the path of duty. It may seem unnatural to the inexperienced, that Mrs Reynolds did not communicate her embarrassment and irresolution, from whatever cause they proceeded, to her husband; but she well knew what would be the result of a consultation; for he, good man, never viewed a subject but from one position, and we are all slow to ask advice that we foresee will be counter to our wishes. Mrs Reynolds, so far then from appealing to the constituted authority of her household, locked her discovery within her own bosom, and, to avoid all suspicion and inquiry, she composed herself as soon as possible, and retired to her bed, but not to sleep; and at peep of dawn, she was up and prepared to obtain all the satisfaction that indirect interrogation could procure from the travellers, and her mental resolution, invigorated by a night's solitary reflection, was `to act up to her light.' They had ordered breakfast at a very early hour, and she took care to be the only person in attendance on them. When they were seated at table, she placed herself in a rocking chair behind them, a position that happily reconciles the necessity of service with the dignity of independence, and began her meditated approaches, by saying to her own countryman, `I believe you left a letter here last night, sir; I laid it in the cupboard for fear of accidents.' `Thank you, ma'am; I ought to have been more careful. It was a letter of some consequence.' `Indeed! Well, I was thinking it might be.' `Ah! what made you think so?' Now we must premise, that neither of the parties speaking, knew anything of that sensitiveness that starts from a question as if an attack were made on private property; but they possessed, in common, the good-natured communicativeness that is said to characterize the New England people, who, in their colloquial traffic, as in other barter, hold exchange to be no robbery. Most women are born diplomatists, and Mrs Reynolds took care to reply to the last interrogatory so carefully as not to commit herself. `It stands to reason,' she said, `a letter that is to go all the way over the wide sea to the old countries, should be of consequence.' `Yes—it is a long voyage.' `You have taken it yourself, perhaps, sir?' `I have. I went out an officer on board one of our cruisers, and was wrecked on the coast of France.' `Of France! Well, we are hand and glove with the French now; but I tell my husband it seems to me like joining with our enemies against those of our own household.' `Ah! Mrs Reynolds, “friends are sometimes better than kindred.” I am sure my own father's son could not have been kinder to me than was Monsieur Angely de Crève-Cœur—hey, Jaubert?' `Ah! vraiment, Monsieur! c'est un bien brave homme, Monsieur St Jean Angely.' `Angely!' said Mrs Reynolds, as if recalling some faded recollection, `Angely—I think I have heard that name before.' `It may be. The gentleman I speak of resided some time in this country.' `But it can't be the same,' replied Mrs Reynolds; `for the person I speak of lived over in Livingston's manner; and kind to strangers he could not be, for he deserted his own flesh and blood, and went off early in the war.' `It may be the same for all that, and must be. As to his deserting his children, “thereby hangs a tale;” but it is a long one.' `Well, sir, if you have anything to say in his favor, I am bold to say I think you ought to speak it; especially as the gentleman seems to have stood your friend in a cloudy day. The story certainly went sadly against him here.' `I have not the slightest objection, ma'am, to telling the story, if you have the patience to hear it; especially as I see I must wait till Jaubert has finished two more of your nice fresh eggs—“eggs of an hour,” Mrs Reynolds.' `We always calculate to have fresh eggs, sir. But what was you going to say of Mr Angely?' she added, betraying, in the tremulous tones of her voice, some emotion more heart stirring than curiosity. Jaubert turned a glance of inquiry on her that was answered by a sudden rush of blood to her cheeks; but the narrator proceeded without noticing anything extraordinary. `It was my good, or ill luck,' he said,—`and it is only in the long run we can tell whether luck be good or ill— but it was my luck to be shipwrecked on the coast of Normandy, and good luck it certainly was, Jaubert, in my distress, to make such a port as the Château de Crève-Cœur—the castle, or, as we should call it here, Mrs Reynolds, the estate of the Angely's. A fine family they are. You may think what a pleasure it was to me to find a gentleman acquainted with my country, and speaking my language as did Mr St Jean Angely. He was kind and affable to me, and always doing something for my pleasure, but I could see he had a heaviness at his heart—that he was often talking of one thing and thinking of another—nothing like so gay as the old gentleman, his father; who was like a fall flower— one of your marigolds, Mrs Reynolds, spreading itself open to every ray of sunshine, as if there were no frosts and winter and death at hand. I felt a pity for the young man. With everything that heart could desire, and without a heart to enjoy, he seemed to me like a sick man seated at a feast of which he could not taste. The day before I was to have come away, he took me aside, and, after saying that I had won his entire confidence, he disclosed to me the following particulars:— `He entered the French army early in life, and while yet a hotblooded, inconsiderate youth, he killed a brother officer in a duel, and was obliged to fly his country. He took refuge in Lisbon. Judgment, I may say mercy, too—in the dealings of Providence, Mrs Reynolds, one is always close on the track of the other—followed him thither. Mr Angely found employment in a mercantile house, and was standing writing at his desk at the moment of the terrible earthquake that laid Lisbon in ruins. The timbers of the house in which he was, were pitched in such a manner as to form a sort of arch over his head, on which the falling roof was sustained, and thus he was, as it were, miraculously delivered from danger. From Lisbon he came to this country. “Mechanics,” says a Spanish proverb, “make the best pilgrims,” but, I am sure, not better than Frenchmen; for cast them where you will, they will get an honest living. Mr Angely came up into Livingston's Manor, and there he took a fancy to a pretty Yankee girl, the only child of a widow, and married her. He earned a subsistence for his family by surveying. The country was new, and skilful surveyors scarce. After a few years his wife died and left him three children.' `Three!' repeated Mrs Reynolds, involuntarily sighing. `Yes, poor things! there were three of them; too many to be left in these hard times fatherless and motherless.' `Ah sir! and what must we think of the father that could forsake his little children at such a time?' `Think no evil, my friend; for Mr Angely did not deserve it. He was employed by Mrs Livingston, early in the war, to go down the river to survey some land near New York. There he was taken by the British as a spy, and, in spite of his remonstrances, sent to England. This was before the French had taken part with us, and he obtained leave to go to France, on giving his parole that he would not return to America. He received a parent's welcome, and the affair of the duel being nearly forgotten, a pardon was obtained for him without difficulty. If he could have forgotten his children, he would have been as happy as man could be; but his anxiety for them preyed on his health and spirits; and when I arrived at the château, his friends imagined he was sinking under some unknown disease. He had not communicated to his father the fact of his marriage and the existence of his children when I arrived there. The old gentleman, kind hearted and reasonable in the main, has all the prejudices of the nobility in the old countries about birth, and his son was afraid to confess, that he had smuggled an ignoble little Yankee into the ancient family of the Crève-Cœurs. So good an opportunity as I afforded of communicating with his children, could not be passed by, and he at length summoned courage to tell the truth to his father. At first he was wroth enough, and stormed and vapored; but after a little while his kind nature got the mastery of the blood of the Crève-Cœurs, and he consented to the children being sent for—the boys, at least.' `Only the boys!' exclaimed Mrs Reynolds, feeling relieved from an insupportable weight. `Only the boys. But the old gentleman might have as well saved all his credit and sent for the girl too; but that was not his pleasure. Well, Monsieur Jaubert here, a relative and particular friend of the family, came out with me to take charge of the children. We found the boys without much difficulty; two noble little fellows that a king might be proud of. After waiting for some time for Monsieur Angely's return, the overseers of the poor, believing he had abandoned his children, bound them out. The little girl had been removed to some distance from her brothers. We found the place where she had been, but not the family. The husband and wife had quarrelled, and separated, and disappeared; and all the information we could obtain, was a vague story that such a child had lived there and had run away; and as nobody in these troublesome times VOL. I. 12 can do more than look after their own children, this poor thing was left to her fate. Hopeless as it appears, Jaubert is not willing to give up our search. He fancies every brunette he sees is the lost Marie, and only last evening he would have persuaded me, that your black eyed little girl might be this stray scion of the CrèveCœurs.' Mrs Reynolds rose and left the room, and did not return till she was sufficiently composed to ask, in an assured voice, `What was their object in looking for the girl, if the father did not mean to reclaim her?' `He did mean to reclaim and provide for her,' replied the traveller, `and for that purpose I have ample funds in my hands. He only conceded to the old gentleman her remaining in the country for the present.' `Had you any direction as to how you were to dispose of her?' `Yes, positive orders to convey her to Boston, and place her under the guardianship of a French lady who resides there, a friend of Mr Angely—one Madame Adelon.' `But could you find no trace of the child?' `Not the slightest.' `And you have determined to make no farther inquiry?' `Why should we? Inquiry is useless, and would but delay to a tempestuous season, Jaubert's return with the boys.' Our readers are doubtless sufficiently aware, that the adopted child of our good landlady was the missing child of Monsieur Angely. A few words will be necessary to explain how she became possessed of her. Mrs Reynolds and her husband were, two years prior to this period, approaching the close of a winter day's ride. Their sleigh was gliding noiselessly through a dry, new fallen snow, when their attention was arrested by the moanings of a child. To stop the horses and search for the sufferer from whom the sounds proceeded, was the instinctive impulse of benevolence. They had not gone many yards from the road, when, nestled close to a rock, and in some measure defended from the cold by a clump of laurels, they found a little girl, her hands and feet frozen, and nearly insensible. They immediately carried her to the sleigh, and put their horses to their utmost speed; but, as they were none of the fleetest, and the nearest habitation was at several miles distance, a considerable time elapsed before they could obtain the means of restoration, and in consequence of this delay, and of severe previous suffering, it was many weeks before the child recovered. In the mean time, though Mrs Reynolds's residence was not more than thirty miles from the place where she had found the child, no inquiry was made for her. The account she gave of herself sufficiently explained this neglect. She said she had no mother; that her father had left home just after the snows melted and the birds came back; that he had left her and her two brothers, Jean and Avenel, with a woman to take care of them; that when this woman had waited a great while for their father, she grew tired and was cross to them, and then she too went away, and left them quite alone. Then she said they had nothing to eat, and she supposed they were the poor, for the men they called the overseers of the poor took her and her brothers, and separated them, and she was carried a great way off to a woman who was very cross to her, and cross to her own children, and her husband was cross too. One night he came home in a great passion, and he began to whip his wife with his big whip, and his wife beat him with the hot shovel, and she, the child, was scared, ran out of the house, and far up into a wood, to get beyond their cries; and when she would have returned, the snow was falling, and she could not find the path, and she had wandered about till she was so cold and tired she could go no farther. Her name, she said, was Angely, and she believed her father was called a Frenchman. The only parental relic she possessed confirmed this statement. It was a locket which she wore suspended at her neck. It contained a lock of hair; an armorial crest was engraven on the back, and under it was inscribed, `St Jean Angely de Crève-Cœur.' This simple story established the conviction, that had been gaining strength in Mrs Reynolds's mind, with every day's attendance on the interesting child, that they had been brought together by the special providence of God; and most faithfully did she discharge the maternal duties that she believed had been thus miraculously imposed on her. The little girl was on her part happy and delighted, and though she sometimes bitterly lamented her father and brothers, yet, as the impressions of childhood are slight, the recollection of them was almost effaced when the mysterious energies of memory were awakened by the sound of a language that seemed to have been utterly forgotten. These events occurred during the revolutionary war, a period of disaster and distress, when a very diligent search for a friendless child was not likely to be made, and as no inquiry ever reached Mrs Reynolds's ear, and as she deemed the foundling an orphan, she had not hesitated to appropriate her. Her name was changed from Marie Angely to Mary Reynolds; and the good woman seemed as secure and happy as any mother, save when she was reminded of the imperfection of her title by the too curious inquiries of travellers. On these occasions she was apt to betray a little irritability, and to veil the truth with a slight evasion, as in the instance which excited the suspicion of our sagacious Frenchman. Her condition was now a pitiable one. She had the tenderness, but not the rights of a parent. She was habitually pure and upright; but now she was strongly swayed by her affections. She would have persuaded herself, that the abandonment in which she first found the child, invested her with a paramount claim; but the stranger's story had proved that her father had not voluntarily abandoned her. Then she thought, `It cannot be for Mary's interest, that I should give her up;' and her mind took a rapid survey of the growing property of which the child was the heir apparent. But she would ask herself, `What do I know of the fortune of her father?' `But surely he cannot, he cannot love her as I do.' `Ah I do not know the feeling of a real parent;' and a burst of tears expressed the sadness of this conviction, and obliged her abruptly to withdraw from the presence of her guests, and leave them amazed at her sudden and violent emotion, while she retired to her own apartment, to implore guidance and support from Heaven. Those who honestly ask for light to point out a way which they would fain not see, and for power to endure a burden from which their nature shrinks, are often themselves astonished at the illumination vouchsafed, and the strength imparted. This was the experience of Mrs Reynolds. She rose from her devotions with the conviction, that but one course remained to her, and with a degree of tranquillity, hastened to Mary's bedroom. The child was just risen and dressed. Without any explanation to her—she was at the moment incapable of making any—she tied her locket, her sole credential, around her neck, led her down stairs, and placing her hand in Jaubert's, she said, `You have found the child!' and then retreated to hide the emotion she could not subdue. 12* It was fortunate for her, that she was not compelled to witness the gay demonstrations of Jaubert's ecstasies. the graver, but not more equivocal manifestations of his companion's satisfaction, and the amazement and curiosity of the little girl, who was listening to the explanation of the strangers, with childlike animation, without adverting to her approaching separation from her who had given her the affection and cares of a parent. But when she came to be severed from this kind friend, she made amends for her thoughtlessness. She clung to her as if nature had knit the bonds that united them, and, amid her cries and sobs, she promised always to remember and love her as a mother. Many have made such promises. Marie Angely kept them. Ten years subsequent to the events above narrated, a letter, of which the following is a translation, was addressed by a foreigner in a high official station in this country, to his friend. `Dear Berville— `It is, I believe, or should be, a maxim of the true church, that confession of a sin is the first step towards its expiation. `Let me, then, invest you with a priest's cassock, and relieve my conscience by the relation of an odd episode in my history. When I parted from you, I was going with my friend, Robert Ellison, to visit his father, who has a beautiful place on the banks of the Hudson. Young Ellison, as you know, is a thorough republican, and does not conceal his contempt for those of his compatriots, who, professing the same principles, are really aristocrats in their prejudices and manners; who, having parted, and as they pretend voluntarily, with the substance, still grasp at the shadow. To test these false pretensions, and to mortify an absurd pride, he joyfully acquiesced in a proposition I made to him, to lay aside the pomp and circumstance of my official character, and to be presented to his friends without any of the accidental advantages with which fortune has invested me. You will inquire my motive, for you will not suspect me of the absurdity of crusading against the follies of society, the most hopeless of all crusades. No, as our own Moliére says, C'est une folie, à nulle autre seconde, De vouloir se mêler de corriger le monde. My motives were then, in the first place, a love of ease, of dishabille; an impatience of the irksomeness of having the dignity of a nation to sustain; and, in the second place, I wished to ascertain how much of the favor lavished on me I should place to the account of the ambassador, and how much I might reserve to my own proper self. `You may call this latent vanity. I will not quarrel with you. I will not pretend that I was moved solely by a love of truth, by a pure desire to find out the realities of things; but alas! my dear Berville, if we were to abstract from the web of our motives, every thread tinged with self, would not warp and woof too disappear? Let, then, my motive be what it might, you will allow the experiment required courage. `We had some difficulty in settling the precise point at which to gage my pretensions. “Do not claim a drop of noble blood,” said my friend, “it would defeat your purpose. There is something cabalistic in that word `noble.' The young ladies at — would at once invest you with the attributes of romance; and the old dowagers would persecute you with histories of their titled ancestors, and anecdotes of lords and ladies that figured in the drawing rooms of the colony. Neither must you be a plain gentleman of fortune, though that may seem to you a sufficient descent from your high station; but fortune has everywhere her shrines and her devotees. You must be the artificer of your own fortune, a talented young man who has no rank or fortune to be spoken of. What say you to the profession of a painter, a portrait painter, since that is the only branch of the art that gets a man bread in this country.” I acceded without shrinking, secretly flattering myself that my friend either underrated my intrinsic merit, or did the world rank injustice. `When we arrived we found a large party of the neighbouring gentry assembled to dine at —. I was received with great courtesy by the elder Ellison, and with kindness by Madame, on the ground, simply, of being an acquaintance of their son's. My friend took care to prevent any elation from my reception by saying to me in a low voice, “My father, God bless him, has good sense, good feeling, and experience, and he well knows that the value of gold does not depend on the circulation it has obtained;” and truly if he had known that I bore the impress of the king's countenance he could not have received me more graciously. There might have been more formality in his reception of the public functionary, but there could not have been more genuine hospitality. He presented me to his guests, and here I was first reminded of my disguise. Instead of the sensation I have been accustomed to see manifested in the lighting up of the face, in the deferential bow, or the blush of modesty, no emotion was visible. No eye rested on me, not a link of conversation was broken, and I was suffered, after rather an awkward passage through the ceremony, to retire to my seat, where I remained, observing, but not observed, till dinner was announced. From the habit of precedence, I was advancing to lead Madame to the dining room, when I encountered my friend's glance, and shrunk back in time to avoid what must have appeared an unpardonable impertinence. I now fell into my modest station in the rear, and offered my arm to an awkward, bashful girl, who I am sure had two left hands by the manner in which she received my courtesy, and who did not honor me so far as to look up to see who it was that had saved her from the mortifying dilemma of leaving the drawingroom alone. I helped my companion from the dish nearest to me, and waited myself till Madame, reminded by her son of her oversight, sent me a plate of soup. I was swallowing this, unmolested by any conversation addressed to me, when my friend's father said to him, “When have you seen the French ambassador, Robert? I hoped you would have persuaded him to pay us a visit.” “`Perhaps he may,” replied my friend, “before the summer is over. He is at present out of the city on some excursion.” “`A prodigious favorite is your son with the French ambassador, as I hear from all quarters,” said a gentleman who sat next Mr Ellison. “`Ah! is that so, Robert? Are you intimate with Monsieur —?” “`He does me the honor to permit my society, sir.” Every mouth was now opened in praise of the ambassador. None of the company had seen him, but all had heard of his abilities, the charms of his conversation, his urbanity, his savoir plaire. “You must be proud of your countryman, M. Dufau?” (this was my assumed name) said my host, with that courtesy that finds a word for the humblest guest. `I said it was certainly gratifying to my national feeling to find him approved in America, but that, perhaps it was not his merit alone that obtained him such distinguished favor; that I had understood he was a great admirer of this country, and though I should do him injustice to say “he praised, only to be praised,” yet I believed there was always a pretty accurately measured exchange in this traffic. “`The gentleman is right,” said an old Englishman who sat opposite to me, and who had not before vouchsafed to manifest a consciousness of my existence; “this is all French palaver in Monsieur —. He cannot be such a warm admirer of this country. The man knows better; he has been in England.” `I was too well acquainted with English manners to be startled by any manifestation of that conviction which an Englishman demonstrates in every part of the world, that his nation has no equal; but I instinctively defended my countryman, and eager for an opportunity to test the colloquial powers so much admired in the ambassador, I entered the lists with my English opponent, and thus stimulated, I was certainly far more eloquent than I ever had been before, on the history, the present condition, and the prospects of this country. But alas for the vanity of M. Dufau! my host, it is true, gave me all the attention he could spare from the courtesies of the table, but save his ear, I gained none but that half accorded by my contemptuous, testy, and impatient antagonist, who after barking out a few sentences at me, relapsed into a moody silence. `I next addressed some trifling gallantries to my bashful neighbour, fancying that she who was neglected by everybody else, would know how to appreciate my attentions; but her eyes were rivetted to a fashionable beauty at the upper extremity of the table, and a half a dozen “no, sirs” and “yes, sirs,” misplaced, were all the return I could obtain from her. To remain silent and passive, you know, to me, was impossible; so I next made an essay on a vinegar faced dame on my left, far in the wane of life. “If my civilities have been lead elsewhere, in this market,” thought I, “they will at least prove silver or gold.” But here I received my cruellest rebuff; for the lady, after apparently listening to me, said, “I do not understand you.” I raised my voice, but she, determining to shelter the infirmity of age at my expense, replied, “I am not so deaf, sir, but really you speak such broken English, that I cannot understand you.” This was too much, and I might have betrayed my vexation, if an intelligent and laughing glance from my friend had not restored my good humor, and a second reflection, suggesting that it was far more important to the old woman's happiness that her vanity should remain unimpaired, than it could be to me to have mine reduced, even to fragments, I humbly begged her pardon, and relapsed into a contented silence, solacing myself with the thought, that our encounter was but an illustration of that of the china and earthen jars. But I will not weary you with detailing all the trials of my philosophy, but only confess that the negligence of the servants was not the least of them—the grinning self-complacency with which these apes of their superiors signified to me that my wants might be deferred. `After all, my humble position would not have been so disagreeable, if I had been accustomed to it. The world's admiration, like all other luxuries, in the end becomes necessary, and then, too, like other luxuries, ceases to be enjoyed, or even felt, till it is withdrawn and leaves an aching void. If this is Irish, set it down to my broken English. `After dinner, I followed the ladies to the drawingroom, and was presented by my friend to Miss —, a reigning beauty. She received me with one of those gracious smiles, that a hacknied belle always bestows on a new worshipper at her shrine. These popular favorites, be it clergyman, politician, or beauty, are as covetous of the flatteries they receive, as a miser is of gold. No matter how unclean the vessel from which the incense rises; no matter what base alloy may mingle with the precious metal. Have you ever encountered one of these spoiled favorites in the thronged street, and tried to arrest the attention for a moment; to fix the eye that was roving for every tributary glance? If you have, you will understand without my describing it, the distrait manner with which the belle received my first compliments. Even this was not long accorded me, for a better accredited and more zealous admirer than myself appearing, she left me to my meditations, which were not rendered the more agreeable by my overhearing an old lady say, in a voice, which, though slightly depressed, she evidently made no effort to subdue to an inaudible key, “I wonder what possessed Robert Ellison to bring that French portrait painter here! How the world has changed since the Revolution! There is no longer any house where you don't meet mixed society.” My friend had approached in time to overhear her as well as myself. “The ignorant old fool!” he exclaimed, “shall I tell her that artists are the nobility of every country?” “`No,” said I, “do not waste your rhetoric; there is no enlightening the ignorance of stupidity; a black substance will not reflect even the sun's rays.” `Ellison then proposed that I should join a party at whist; but I complained of the heated air of the drawingroom, and, availing myself of my insignificance, I followed the bent of my inclinations, a privilege the humble should not undervalue, and sauntered abroad. The evening was beautiful enough to have soothed a misanthrope, or warmed the heart of a stoic. Its peace, its salutary, sacred voice restored me to myself, and I was ashamed that my tranquillity had been disturbed. I contemned the folly of the artificial distinctions of life, and felt quite indifferent to them—when alone. `The ground in front of my friend's house slopes to the Hudson, and is still embellished with trees of the majestic native growth. Where nature has left anything to be supplied by art, walks have been arranged and planted; but carefully, so as not to impede the view of the river, which was now in perfect repose. A sloop lay in the channel, its sails all furled, idly floating on the slumbering surface. While I was wishing my friend were with me, for I am too much of a Frenchman to relish fully even nature, the favorite companion of sentimentalists, in solitude, I saw a boat put off from the little vessel, and row slowly towards the shore. Presently a sweet female voice swelled on the stillness of the night, accompanied by the notes of a guitar, struck by a practised hand. Could any young man's mercury resist moonlight and such music? Mine could not, and I very soon left behind me all of terra firma that intervened between me and the siren, and ensconced myself in a deeply shaded nook at the very water's edge, where I could see and hear without being observed. The boat approached the spot where I stood, and was moored at half a dozen yards from my feet; but as my figure was in shadow, and sheltered by a thick copse of hazel bushes, I was perfectly concealed, while, by a flood of moonbeams, that poured on my unsuspicious neighbours, I saw them as plainly as if it were daylight. These were two men, whom I soon ascertained to be the captain VOL. I. 13 of the sloop and an attendant, and that they were going to a farm house in the neighbourhood for eggs, milk, &amp;c. The two females were to remain in the boat till their return. The lady of the guitar was inclined to go with them as far as the oak wood on the brow of the hill; but the captain persuaded her to remain in the boat, by telling her there was a formidable dog on the place, which she might encounter. As soon as the captain was gone, her companion, an elderly, staid looking country woman, said to her, “Now, child, as I came here for your pleasure, you must sing for mine. None of your newfangled fancies, but good Old Robin Grey.” “`Oh, Robin Grey is a doleful ditty; but anything to reward you for indulging me in coming on shore.” `She then sung that touching ballad. The English, certainly the Scotch, excel us as much in the pathos of unembellished nature and truth, as we do them in all literary refinement, ingenuity, and grace. I know not how much of the tribute that gushed from my heart was paid to the poetry and music, and how much to the beautiful organ by which they were expressed, for the fair musician looked herself like one of the bright creations of poetry. I would describe her, but description is cold and quite inadequate to convey an idea of her, and of the scene with which she harmonized. It was one of nature's sweetest accords; the balmy air, the cloudless sky, the river, reflecting like a spotless mirror the blue arch, the moon and her bright train; my enchantress, the embodied spirit of the evening, and her music the voice of nature. I might have forgotten that I was in human mould, but I had one effectual curb to my imagination; one mortal annoyance. Argus, confound him! had followed me from the house, and it was only by dint of continued coaxing and caressing that I could keep him quiet. Before the ballad was finished, however, he was soothed by its monotonous sadness, and crouching at my feet, he fell asleep, I believe. I forgot him. Suddenly “the dainty spirit” changed from the low breathings of melancholy to a gay French air—the very air, Berville, that Claudine, in her mirthful moments, used to sing to us. The transition was so abrupt that it seemed as if the wing of joy had swept over the strings of her instrument. I started forth from my concealment. That was not all. Argus sprang out, too, and barking furiously, bounded towards the boat. The old woman screamed, “There is the dog!” and the young lady, not less terrified, dropped her guitar, and, unhooking the boat, she seized an oar and pushed it off without listening to my apologies and assurances. In her agitation she dropped the oar, and her companion, still more tremulous than herself, in her attempt to regain it, lost the other, which she had instinctively grasped. As soon as the first impulse imparted to the boat was expended, it scarcely moved at all, and I had leisure to explain my sudden appearance, and to say that my dog, far from being the formidable animal they imagined, was a harmless spaniel, who should immediately make all the amends in his power for the terror he had caused. I then directed him to the floating oars. He plunged into the water and brought them to me, but he either did not, or would not understand my wish that he should convey them to the boat, which, though very slowly, was evidently receding from the shore. I then, without farther hesitation, threw off my coat, swam to the boat, and receiving there the oars from Argus's mouth, I soon reconducted the boat to its haven. There was something enchanting to me in the frankness with which my fair musician expressed her pleasure at the homage I had involuntarily paid to her art, and the grace with which she received the slight service I rendered her. Perhaps I felt it the more for the mortifying experience of the day. I do not care very nicely to analyze my feelings, nor to ascertain how much there was of restored self complacency in the delicious excitement of that hour.' `The elderly lady, for lady she must needs be since my fair incognita called her mother, expressed a matronly solicitude about the effect of my wet garments, but I assured her that I apprehended no inconvenience from them, and I begged to be allowed to remain at my station till the return of their attendants. The circumstances of our introduction had been such as to dissipate all ceremony. Indeed, this characteristic of English manners would have as ill fitted the trustful, ingenuous, and gay disposition of my new acquaintance, as a coat of mail her light, graceful person. She sung, at my request, our popular opera airs, with more effect, because with far more feeling, than our best professed artists. She talked of music, and of the poetry of nature, with genius and taste; and she listened with that eager and pleased attention, which is the second best gift of conversation. I should have taken no note of the passage of time but for the fidgetting of the old lady, who often interrupted us with expressions of her concern at the captain's delay, for which he, quite too soon, appeared to render an account himself. As I was compelled to take my leave, I asked my fair unknown if I might not be allowed to think of her by some more accurate designation than the “Lady of the Guitar.” “`My name is”—she replied promptly, and then, after a moment's hesitation, added, “No—pardon me, your romantic designation better suits the adventure of the night.” I was vexed at my disappointment, but she chased away the shade of displeasure by the graceful playfulness with which she kissed her hand to me as the boat pushed off. I lingered on the shore till she had reached the vessel, and then slowly retraced my steps towards the house. I was startled by meeting my friend, for my mind was so absorbed that I had not heard his approaching footstep. “Ah!” he exclaimed, `is this your philosophy? turned misanthrope at the first frown from the world?” “`My philosophy,” I replied, “has neither been vanquished, nor has it conquered, for I had forgotten all its trials.” `My friend evidently believed, notwithstanding my disclaimer, that my vanity required some indemnity for the humiliations it had sustained, and he repeated to me some assuaging compliments from his father. “But,” he concluded, “tell me, have you really turned sentimentalist, and been holding high converse with the stars?” `With a most brilliant star,' I replied, and related my adventure. `Ellison's curiosity was excited, and he proposed we should take our flutes, go out in the barge, and serenade the “Lady of the Guitar.” I, of course, assented, and the next half hour found us floating around the little vessel like humble satellites. We played an accompaniment and sung alternately, he in English, and I in French; but there was no token given that the offered incense was accepted; no salutation, save a coarse one from the captain, who invited us to go “on board and take some grog.” We of course declined his professional courtesy. “Then, for the Lord's sake, lads,” he said, “stop your piping, and give us a good birth. Sleep, at this time o' night, is better music than the jolliest tune that ever was played.” `Thus dismissed, and discomfited by the lady's neglect, we resumed our oars and were preparing to return to the shore, when the cabin window was gently raised, 13* and our fair incognita sung a sweet little French air, beginning “Adieu, adieu!” We remained, sound, motion, almost breath suspended till the song was finished.' “So sweetly she bids us adieu, I think that she bids us return,” said my friend, and we instantly rowed our boat towards the stern of the vessel. At this moment the sash was suddenly dropped, and taking this for a definitive “Good night,” we retired. `Now, dear Berville, I have faithfully related the adventures of my masquerade—my boyish pastime, you may call it. Be it so. This day has been worth a year of care and dignity. I shall return to New York in a few days. Till then farewell. Yours, Constant.' But though M. Constant professed himself satisfied with his day, there was a lurking disquietude at his heart. He had written to assure himself there was nothing there he dare not express, and yet he had concluded without once alluding to the cause of his self-reproach. He had folded the letter, but he opened it, and added;— `P. S. I did not describe to you my friend's vexation that the responded song was in French. “Ah!” said he, “I see there is no chance for such poor devils as I, so long as you are neither married nor betrothed.”' He again closed the letter, and was for a moment satisfied that there could be nothing in the nature of that which he had so frankly communicated that required concealment. He walked to the window and eyed the little vessel as a miser looks at the casket that contains his treasure; then starting from his reverie, he took from his bosom a miniature, and contemplated it steadfastly for a few moments; `It is my conscience that reproaches me,' he said, `and not this serene, benign countenance. O Emma! thou art equally incapable of inflicting and resenting wrong, and shall thy trust and gentleness be returned by even a transient treachery? Am I so sure of faithfully keeping the citadel that I may parley with an enemy?' The result of this self-examination was a determination to burn the letter, and to dismiss forever from his mind the enchantress whose power had so swayed him from his loyalty. But though he turned from the window, resolutely closed the blind, and excluded the moonlight, which he fancied influenced his imagination as if he were a lunatic; though he went to bed and sunk into oblivious sleep, the spirit was not laid. Imagination revelled in its triumph over the will. He was in France, in beautiful France—more beautiful now than in the visions of memory and affection. He was at his remembered haunts in his father's grounds; the `Lady of the Guitar' was with him; she sang his favorite songs; he saw her sparkling glance, her glowing cheek, her rich, dark tints, `The embrowning of the fruit that tells How rich within, the soul of sweetness dwells;' he heard the innocent childlike laugh, that, —`without any control, Save the sweet one of gracefulness rung from her soul.' Then there was interposed between him and this embodied spirit of his joyous clime a slowly moving figure; a cold, fair, pensive countenance, that had more of sorrow than resentment, but still, though its reproach was gentle, it was the reproach of the stern spectre of conscience. He cast down his eyes, and they fell on the word `BETROTHED,' traced in the sand at his feet. The `Lady of the Guitar' was gaily advancing towards him. Another step and her flowing mantle would have swept over the word, and effaced it forever. He raised his hand to deprecate her approach, and awoke; and while the visions of sleep still confusedly mingled with the recollections and resolutions of the preceding day, he was up and at the window; had thrown open the blind and ascertained that the vessel still lay becalmed in the stream. That virtue is certainly to be envied, that does not need to be shielded and fortified by opportunity and circumstance. If the vessel had disappeared, the recollections of the evening might have been as evanescent and ineffectual as the dreams of the night; but there it was, in fine relief, and as motionless as if it were encased in the blue waters. In spite of M. Constant's excellent resolutions, he lingered at the window, and returned there as if he were spellbound. Strange power that could rivet his eyes to an ill shapen little Dutch skipper! But that body did contain a spirit, and that spirit, seemingly as perturbed as his own, soon appeared, moving with a light step to and fro on the deck. The apartment M. Constant occupied, was furnished, among other luxuries, with a fine spyglass. To resist using this facility for closer communion was impossible; and by its aid he could perceive every motion of the `lady of his thoughts,' almost the changes of her countenance. He saw she was gazing on the shore, and that she turned eagerly to her companion to point her attention to some object that had caught her eye, and at the same moment he perceived it was his friend, who was strolling on the shore. Ellison saw him too, and waved his handkerchief in salutation. M. Constant returned the greeting, threw down the glass, and withdrew from the window with a feeling of compunction at his indulgence, as if he had again heard that word betrothed spoken. Why is it that external agents have so much influence over the mysterious operations of conscience? Why is it that its energy so often sleeps while there is no witness to the wrong we commit? `Keep thy heart, for out of it are the issues of life.' After breakfast, Ellison said to M. Constant, `I am afraid you find your masquerade dull. Let us beguile the morning by a visit to your “Lady of the Guitar.” There is nothing lends such wings to time as a pretty girl. Our guests are a dull concern.' `A dull concern, when there is a beauty and a fortune among them!' `Yes, a sated belle is to me as disagreeable as a pampered child; as my grandmother's little pet Rosy, whom I saw the other day, tossing away her sugar plums, and crying “'T is not sweet enough;” and as to fortune, though I am neither a philosopher nor a sentimentalist, I shall never take the temple of Hymen in my way to wealth; for of all speculations, a matrimonial speculation seems to me the most hazardous, and the most disgraceful. But we loiter. Will you pay your devoirs to our unknown?' `I believe not; I have letters to write this morning.' `To Emma? Pardon me—I do not mean to pry into your cabinet, but if the letters are to her they may be deferred. She is a dear good soul and will find twenty apologies for every fault you commit.' `If they are to her, such generosity should not be abused. No, I will not go. But on what pretext will you?' `Pretext indeed! does a pilgrim seek for a pretext to visit my Lady of Loretto, or the shrine of any other saint? Here comes the gardener with a basket of fine fruit which I have ordered to be prepared, and of which I shall be the bearer to the sufferers pent in that dirty sloop this breathless August morning—from mere philanthropy you know. Commend me to Emma,' he added gaily; `I will bear witness for you that your enthusiasm for this unknown was a mere coup de la lune, and that when daylight appeared you were as loyal, and—as dull as a married man.' Ellison's raillery did not render the bitter pill of self-denial more palatable to M. Constant. He turned away without reply, but instead of returning to his apartment he obtained a gun, and inquiring the best direction to pursue in quest of game, he sauntered into a wooded defile that wound among the hills, and was so enclosed by them as not to afford even a glimpse of the river. Here he threw himself on the grass, took a blank leaf from his pocketbook and began a sonnet to constancy, but broke off in the middle; scribbled half a dozen odd lines from the different songs that had entranced him on the preceding evening; sketched a guitar, then rose, and, still musing, pursued his way up the defile. The path he had taken led him around the base of an eminence to a rivulet that came frolicking down a hill, now leaping, and now loitering with the capricious humor of childhood. He traced it to its source, a clear fountain bubbling up from the earth at the foot of a high, precipitous rock. Clusters of purple and pink wild flowers hung from the clefts of the rock, wreathing its bare old front, and presenting a beautiful harmony in contrast, like infancy and old age. The rock and the sides of the fountain formed a little amphitheatre, enclosed and deeply shaded by the mountain ash, the aromatic hemlock and the lofty basswood. This sequestered retreat, with its fresh aspect and sweet exhalations, afforded a delicious refuge from the fierce heat and overpowering light of an August day. M. Constant was lingering to enjoy it when his ear caught the sound of distant and animated voices. He started, and for a moment thought himself cheated by the illusions of a distempered fancy; but, as the sounds approached nearer, he was assured of their reality, and they affected him like the most painful discord, though they were produced by the sweet, clear, penetrating voice of the unknown, and the hitherto welcome tones of his friend. The impropriety of a young girl straying off into such a solitude with an acquaintance of an hour was obvious, but was perhaps more shocking to M. Constant than it would have been to a perfectly disinterested observer. It gave a dreadful jar to his preconceived notions, and contrasted, rudely enough, with the conduct of the preceding night, when the lady had, with such scrupulous delicacy, forborne to show herself on the deck of the sloop. As they drew nearer he thought there was something in the gay, familiar tones of Ellison, disgusting; and the laugh of the lady, which before had seemed the sweetest music of a youthful and innocent spirit, was now harsh and hoydenish. The strain of their conversation, too, for they were near enough to be heard distinctly, while the windings of the path prevented his being seen, though it was graceful chitchat enough, appeared to him trifling and flippant in the extreme. As they came still nearer he listened more intently, for he had a personal interest in the subject. `And so, my “Lady of the Guitar,”' said Ellison, `you persist in preserving that scrap of paper, merely, I presume, as a specimen of the sister arts of design and poetry. You are sure those scratches are meant for a guitar, and not a jewsharp, and that the fragment is a sonnet and not a monody?' `Certainly it is a sonnet; the poet says so himself. See here—“Sonnet à la Constance.”' `Well, it is certainly in the strain of a “lament.” My friend was in a strait; what he would do he could not. Constancy is a very pretty theme for a boarding-school letter, but I am afraid the poor fellow will not find his inspiration in this tame virtue?' `Ah! these tame virtues, as you call them,' replied the lady, `are the salutary food of life, while your themes of inspiration are intoxicating draughts, violent and transient in their effects.' `A very sage lesson, and very well conned. Did your grandmother teach it to you?' `No matter—I have got it by heart.' `O those moral New Englanders, they change all the poetry of life to wise saws. Thank heaven you have escaped from them in time to retain some portion of your original mercurial nature. But now let me tell you, my sage young friend, that same paper may prove as dangerous where you are going as a match to a magazine. So let me advise you, either keep it quite to yourself, or give it to the winds.' `You talk riddles, Mr Ellison; but I will not be quizzed into believing this little castaway scrap of paper can be of any import.' `Let me label it for you then, if, as I see, it is to be filed among the precious stores of your pocketbook.' There was a short pause when the lady, as M. Constant supposed, looking over Ellison's superscription, read aloud, `Love's Labor Lost,' and then exclaimed, `Pshaw, Robert, how absurd!' and tore off the offensive label, while he laughed at her vexation. M. Constant felt that it would be very embarrassing for him to be discovered as a passive listener to this coversation. He had been chained to the spot by an interest that he would gladly not have felt, but which he could not suppress. Another turn would bring them directly before him. To delay longer without being seen was therefore impossible. As he put aside the rustling branches, he heard Ellison exclaim, `Ha! there are some startled quails;' but before his friend could take a more accurate observation, he had sprung around an angle of the rock, and was beyond sight and hearing. The gentlemen met before dinner. M. Constant was walking on the piazza, apparently moody and little disposed to sympathize with Ellison's extravagant expressions of admiration of the unknown, or of regret that the fresh breeze was now wafting the vessel and its precious cargo far away. `In the name of Heaven, Constant,' he said, `what has so suddenly turned you to ice? Last night you seemed to think it necessary to invent—pardon me—allege some apology for your prompt sensibility, and you said it was not the beauty, the voice, the grace, or any of the obvious and sufficient charms of this young enchantress—that was your word—that fascinated you, but it was a resemblance to the glowing beauties of your own clime; and now, if you had been born at the north pole and she at the equator, you could not manifest less affinity.' `There are certain principles,' replied M. Constant, coldly, `that overcome natural affinities. I hope you have passed your morning agreeably.' `Agreeably? Delightfully! Our incognita is more beautiful than you described her.' `Is she then still incognita to you?' asked M. Constant with a penetrating glance. `Not exactly; she favored me with her name.' `Her name! what is it?' `Pardon me, I am under a prohibition not to tell.' VOL. I. 14 `The lady certainly makes marked distinctions. She is as reserved towards others, as frank to you.' `She had her reasons.' `Doubtless; but what were they?' `Why, one was that I refused to tell her your name.' `And why did you that?' `I had my reasons, too.' M. Constant was vexed at the mystery his friend affected. He was annoyed, too, at his perfect self complacency and imperturbable good nature, and, more than all, ashamed of his own irritability. He made an effort to overcome it, and to put himself on a level with Ellison. He succeeded so far in his efforts as to continue to talk of the lady with apparent nonchalance till he was summoned to dinner; but though he tried every mode his ingenuity could devise, he could not draw from his friend the slightest allusion to the lady's extraordinary visit to the shore, or any particular of their interview, which explained the perfect familiarity that seemed to exist between them; and what made this mystery more inscrutable, was the tone of enthusiasm which Ellison maintained in speaking of the lady, and which no young man sincerely feels without a sentiment of respect. In spite of M. Constant's virtuous resolutions and efforts, the `Lady of the Guitar' continued to occupy his imagination, and he determined to take the surest measures to dispel an influence which he had in vain resisted. As he parted from his friend at night, he announced his intention of taking his departure the following morning. After expressing his sincere regret, Ellison said, `You go immediately to town?' `No; I go to Mr Liston's.' `Ah! is it so?' `Even so, Ellison; but no more till we meet again. I have supported my masquerade with little spirit; but do not betray me, and we, neither of us, shall lose reputation.' M. Constant had for a long time been on terms of intimacy and friendship with Miss Liston. This lady belonged to one of the most distinguished families in our country. She was agreeable in her person, had a fund of good sense, was well informed and perfectly amiable. Such characters are admirable in the conduct of life, if not exciting to the imagination; that precious faculty, which, like the element of fire, the most powerful and dangerous agent, may warm, or may consume us. Long and intimate friendship between unfettered persons of different sexes is very likely to terminate, as that of M. Constant and Miss Liston terminated, in an engagement. He had a sentiment of deep and fixed affection for her, which, probably, no influence could have materially affected; but when that being crossed his path who seemed to him to realize the brightest visions of his youth, he felt a secret consciousness that the fidelity of his affection was endangered. The little mystery in which the unknown was shrouded, the very circumstance of calling her `the unknown,' magnified the importance of the affair, as objects are enlarged, seen through a mist. He very wisely and prudently concluded that the surest way of dispelling all illusion, would be frankly to relate the particulars to Miss Liston, only reserving to himself certain feelings which would not be to her edification, and which he believed would be dispelled by participating their cause with her. Accordingly, at their first meeting he was meditating how he should get over the embarrassment of introducing the subject, when Miss Liston said, `I have a great pleasure in reserve for you,' and left him without any farther explanation, and in a few moments returned, followed by a lady, and saying as she reentered, `Marie Angely, you and Constant, my best friends, must not meet as strangers.' A half suppressed exclamation burst from the lips of both. All M. Constant's habitual grace forsook him. He overturned Miss Liston's workstand, workbox, and working paraphernalia, in advancing to make his bow. Miss Angely's naturally high color was heightened to a painful excess; she made an effort to reciprocate the common courtesies of an introduction, but in vain; the words faltered on her lips, and after struggling a moment with opposing feelings, the truth and simplicity of her heart triumphed, and turning to Miss Liston, she said, `Your friend, Emma, is the gentleman I met on the river.' Miss Liston had been the confidant of all her romantic young friend's impressions from her moonlight interview with the stranger, and it was now her turn to suffer a full share of the embarrassment of the other parties. She looked to M. Constant for an explanation. Never had he, in the whole course of his diplomatic career, been more puzzled; but after a moment's hesitation he followed Miss Angely in the safe path of ingenuousness and truly told all the particulars of his late adventures, concluding with a goodhumored censure of his friend Ellison, who had long and intimately known Miss Angely, and who, to gratify his mischief loving temper, had contrived the mystery which led to the rather awkward dénouement. Thus these circumstances, which might have been woven into an intricate web of delicate embarrassment and romantic distress, that might have ended in the misery of one, perhaps of all parties, were divested of their interest and their danger by being promptly and frankly disclosed. Miss Angely, whom our readers have already recognised as the little girl of the inn, had met with Miss Liston at a boarding school in Boston, where, though Miss Liston was her elder by several years, they formed an enthusiastic, and, rare in the annals of boarding schools, an enduring friendship. Marie Angely had faithfully discharged the debt of gratitude to Mrs Reynolds, and though acquiring, as may be supposed, somewhat of the fastidiousness that accompanies refined education and intercourse, no one could perceive and abatement of her respect or affection for her kind protectress, or the slightest diminution of her familiarity with her. She passed a part of every summer with her, always called her mother, and, by the fidelity of her kindness and the charm of her manner, she diffused light and warmth over the whole tract of Mrs Reynolds's existence. She linked expectations, that might have been blasted, to a happy futurity, and cherished and elevated affections, which, but for her sunny influence, would have been left to wither and perish. Oh that the fortunate and happy could know how much they have in their gift! Miss Angely had been on one of her annual visits to her humble friend, and was on her way, accompanied by her, to New York, where she was to join Miss Liston, when the incidents occurred which we have related. There is nothing in the termination of our tale to indemnify the lover of romance for its previous dulness; but it is a true story, and its materials must be received from tradition, and not supplied by imagination. M. Constant was, in the course of a few weeks, united to Miss Liston. This lady had long cherished a hope that her friend would be a permanent member of her family, and she used every art of affection to persuade her to remain with her at least so long as she should decline the suits of all the lovers who were now 14* thronging around her, attracted by her beauty, or loveliness, or the eclat she derived from her intimacy with the wife of the ambassador. M. Constant did not very warmly second his wife's entreaties. He perhaps had a poignant recollection of certan elective affinities, and his experience taught him the truth, if indeed he had not derived it from a higher source, that, in the present infirm condition of human virtue, it is always safest and best not voluntarily to `enter into temptation.' Miss Angely returned to Boston. M. Constant's union with Miss Liston was one of uninterrupted confidence and conjugal happiness; but it was not destined to be of long duration. His wife died in about a year after their marriage. Among her papers was found a letter addressed to her husband, written in expectation of the fatal issue of the event that had terminated her life, in which she earnestly recommended her friend as her successor. In due time her request was honored. M. Constant married Miss Angely. After residing for some time in America, they went to France, where she was received as an ornament to her noble family, and acknowledged to be `the brightest jewel in its coronet.' Far from the mean pride of those who shrink from recurring to the humble stages in their progress to the heights of fortune, Madame Constant delighted in relating the vicissitudes of her life, and dwelt particularly on that period, when, as Mrs Reynolds's handmaid, she considered herself honored in standing behind the chair of the wife of the great General Knox. `The longest day comes to the vesper hour.' Madame Constant closed at Paris a life of virtue, prosperity, and happiness, in July 1827. THE PALISADOES. BY GRENVILLE MELLEN. Edgar. Horrible steep! Hark! do you hear the sea? Come on, sir—here 's the place; stand still— How dizzy 't is to cast one's eyes so low! — the murmuring surge, That on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes, Cannot be heard so high; I 'll look no more, Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong. King Lear. `This, then, at last,' said I, `is the broad and beautiful Hudson!' I addressed myself to my companion, a tall fellow, with a healthy look, who stood at my side. But he had been here before, and a simple nod of acquiescence was all I received in answer. `There is an air of singular complacency about some people,' thought I, `but perhaps it is a necessary virtue in their way of life, and requires cultivation.' So I surrendered myself, as well as I could, to my own reflections. The scene was indeed beautiful. A mellow sunset was settling upon the hills and waters, and a thousand flashes played over the distant city, as its spires and prominent objects caught its glories. Above these fading lights stretched a heavy line of smoke, already condensing under the damp atmosphere of the evening, and reaching far away over the metropolis, till it was lost in the purpling hues of the sky. At intervals, a dull sound would seem to come out of the city, and, stealing over the waters which reposed between us, recalled for a moment the remembrance of the busy scenes which I had so lately witnessed there. On one side rose impending cliffs, their wood crowned summits tinged with the last blush of the twilight. Below, in the deep shadow of the rocks against which they seemed to lean, stood the old trees, that only served to increase the gloom that extended itself over all the slope to the waters. Every dell and nook under the gray canopy, had deepened into blackness, and a perfect night reigned in the recesses which embosom this delightful river. On the opposite bank lay a landscape rejoicing in the luxury of its bright verdure, and rising in gentle undulations, till its heights reposed in the dreamy light of the sunset. Far up in the north stretched the magnificent river, melting in the distance, amidst its forests and rocks and hills, undisturbed by a breath, and unbroken in its surface, save where some dark speck was seen to flit across its bosom, and leave in its track a dusky vapor, which was almost instantly absorbed in the gathering gloom. Night was fast falling on everything round me. My eyes were fastened on the black bank and those towering cliffs. I was completely lost in reverie. I felt a relief in gazing there, and strange, long reaching associations came round me. At one moment, as we passed a little point that shot out from the shadow, I thought I saw some low, white object, like a monument, rising on that desolate shore, and just reflected in the peaceful waters. Perhaps this was imagination, for I was ready to picture out anything wild and solemn, as I floated by those dim solitudes. I had heard tales of places hereabouts, that froze up my young blood; and then I had felt it break away again in the heat of my indignation, till it throbbed audibly through every vein. These recollections came over me now in all the vividness of former times. Story became reality, and I pressed my eyes together, and turned away under the fearful expectation of witnessing some scene of terror, which would `fright' my exiled spirit `from its propriety.' `It's gone! it 's gone! Farewell for aye to whatever falls into the wake of a steamboat.' These words, accompanied with a gentle touch at my elbow, caused me to turn again, and a man stood at my side, directing my attention to a piece of paper, fluttering upon the waves behind us, and which I had unconsciously dropped from my hand in the intenseness of my reverie. `It was of no consequence,' I said; `some foolish thoughts of my own. Let the water nymphs underneath make as much as they may of it, and welcome.' `O'er thoughtful, and much on the abstract, for one so young, methinks,' said the stranger, fixing a pair of dark eyes upon me. `But,' continued he in an undertone, and as though he was talking with himself, as he looked once more back on the shadowy waves, `of consequence or not, the youth's paper is setting in with the current towards the Red Graves, and will find the shore thereabouts before morning.' Then turning sharply upon me, `Young man, yours is not the first nor the only piece of fair, white paper I have seen floating in upon that desolate point. We can scarce see it now for the darkness.' I had heard enough of the soliloquy which preceded this address, to awaken my curiosity, and as these last words had no tendency to allay it, I observed that his allusions were nothing less than Greek to me; but, as the trifling incident which gave rise to them, had also brought us in some sort into conversation together, I would make bold to beg him to go into the matter, and if a story was to be told, to assure him I would become a willing, nay, a delighted auditor. Meanwhile I could not but observe with some surprise, that we were left alone upon deck. It had become quite dark, and the night breeze was beginning to sing over the cool waters. Instead of the last sunlight reflected faintly on the fading clouds, as I had seen it when I fixed my gaze on that silent and cheerless shore, thousands of stars were now twinkling over my head. Many busy faces were passing before and around me then, but now one solitary being stood before me. The man at the helm was above with his light, and, at intervals, the worn and exhausted furnace feeder would issue from his dazzling purgatory to wipe his hot brow in the evening air. These were the two alone, beside ourselves, who seemed to keep the night watches. The stranger fairly took the hint I spake upon, and, beckoning me to the stern of the vessel, desired I would be seated, while he should relate to me the little story, the recollection of which I had been instrumental in recalling to his mind. Following his example, I wrapped my cloak about me, and stretched myself out on an inclined seat, in a state of lazy and delicious preparation. Meanwhile I had taken occasion to scan the exterior of my companion. He was a man much under the middle size, of a thin and apparently a wasted frame. His head was covered with an enormous slouched hat, somewhat in the Spanish fashion, and under its shadow appeared a face of uncommon and rather sinister expression. It seemed to belong to something more than an octogenarian. It was cadaverous, shrunken, and pointed, and as incapable of change and muscular pliancy during the relation which followed, as though it had been hewn from a block of mummy complexioned marble. His brow, half hidden under his hat, had contracted into many furrows; and there they remained, inerasible, and as immoveable as fate. Eyes of dark gray, the only moving things, save his thin lips, on the dead surface of his physiognomy, seemed sometimes to kindle as with the light of former days, as I from time to time observed them in the starry brilliancy which they occasionally reflected. The nose was one which had evidently been compelled by hunger or decay, from something well nigh related to a parabola, into a decided triangle, and was a remnant well worthy of Slawkenbergius, and one of the best from the promontory. The cheeks were sallow and solemn, well comporting with the motionless rigidity of the whole superficies. The mouth was one which would have puzzled Lavater, guarded inwardly by perfect files of small, white teeth, those terrifying indices of something miraculous about an old proprietor; while without, the skinny lips were tightly drawn into that downward curve so finely expressive of malice and contempt. Such a mouth was now to be my oracle! A chin, pointed as its fellow projection above, completed this wild and singular countenance. His beard lay like hoarfrost along its extremities, and a single glance I got convinced me that the principle of life had deserted it. It lay withered upon that mysterious chin. Not a single hair escaped from under cover; of course, I was justified in the conclusion, that he was as bald as Time. A sad colored cloak of no particular cloth, enveloped his whole person, and now and then, as it waved in the wind, I thought I had discerned the portentous insignia of high Dutch consequence in the singular developement of the leg. I set him down as one of the most ancient of the Ten Breeches. In perfect keeping with his other extremities, he wore a pair of pointed shoes, that projected from under his mysterious robe, and bore some marks of antique origin. Such was the singular being, beside whom I was now reclining, in expectation of a tale as singular as its author. There was certainly something more than common about this man, fitted to waken thoughts of a strange and undefinable nature within me. His presence was a matter that troubled me from the beginning. I thought of the suddenness of his appearance before me; and I had no recollection of having seen any such person on board during the day. His voice was low, too, but wonderfully deep, and I remembered when he walked the quarter, it shook as though a double steam engine was playing beneath it. Judge then, gentle reader, with what feelings I listened to this master of mysteries! But I was determined not to be awed out of my story; and as though to restore me to the consciousness that something human was still in my neighbourhood, a strong light from the cabin, shot up from below, and in its glare I could recognise some still wakeful faces, that I had seen round me in the daylight. I therefore reclined once more upon my solitary seat. The stars were shining brilliantly over our heads, the waves were rushing and gurgling directly under us, and he began. `Those gray, perpendicular rocks, that seemed to absorb so much of your attention at twilight, are called, in these vile modern times, the Palisadoes. Time was, the which I can well remember,'—I ventured a look—but the big hat put it out of the question—`aye, as though it were but yesterday, when those topping fellows were known by the downright sensible name of the Bold Bruisers; and so men were content to call them, till that matter of independence crazed this feverish people, and then almost every spot in the land, if it was so unfortunate as to be high or queer shaped, was dashed at once from the family nomenclature, and thenceforward known by some appellation, with which it was tortured by the exclusive spirit of the time. There was your Mount Washington, and Mount Defiance, your Charter Oaks, and your Cradles of Liberty; Cape Revolution and the Free Breakers, certain desperate looking rocks that jutted out along the coast, called Constitution Boys, and the Tax Takers; and among a host of others, these veritable perpendicular masses, denominated the Palisadoes, for the simple reason that their appearance served to give you some notion of defence and obstinacy; defence against they knew not what—nothing in particular; and obstinacy—but I must refer you to the Bill of Rights, and be careful, I suppose, how I take in vain that magical word “Freedom.” Yet one would think, from this poor name, that the hot republicans believed they could enclose the North River with a stone wall! Verily, verily there would have been some meaning in this matter, if the worthy Dutchman, who ruled that fair city aforetime, but who shall be nameless, had only succeeded when he swore he would swivel the Bold Bruisers on their south pivot across the Hudson, and block up all passage against the British, by an effectual embargo. Then you might have talked about palisades with a vengeance; and what with such a troublesome fence here, and that wicked “Gate” on the other side, Gotham at least would have been safe, merely through the terrors excited by its localities. But we have nearly passed the rocks, and I must hasten to my story. `In 1777, while Howe lay in New York, a short distance down where the country slopes away from those same Palisadoes, in a beautiful and romantic dell, lived Isabel Vaughan and her widowed mother. Old Frank Vaughan, then one of the noblest hearts that beat in the land, had died in one of the hard times of '76, and left this little family with a small farm, and, report said, some bright dollars, to lead out their days, as well as they could, in the silent residence which he had chosen. VOL. I. 15 There was an air of uncommon seclusion and peace about this dwelling. The hand of taste was also betrayed in the arrangement of foliage and flowers around the doors and windows. Wild blossoms were creeping in over your head as you sat at the one, or stood before the other. A little garden smiled in the sunshine which lay brightly and calmly along the valley; and at morning or evening might be seen a fair and graceful creature bending among the shrubbery, and conducting the roses and honeysuckles with studious care, in every direction, and with every fanciful variety, to embower the sweet and solitary spot that seemed to contain all her happiness. `I need not describe Isabel to you. She was the delight and support of her little home, and as beautiful as the most brilliant of the flowers she watched over. She had grown up in the bosom of a virtuous family, and her young mind had become early imbued with that deep enthusiasm, which the times had generated in the breasts of all the people, and in which her father largely participated. The stern and devoted spirit which had entered and expanded the hearts of the Puritans in their early struggles, seemed to have come with little alloy down to the time of the Revolution, and in some instances to have brought with it that austere sense of duty and abandonment to the cause, which characterised the pilgrim fathers. With these feelings Frank Vaughan rushed to the ranks, and fell; and with these feelings, somewhat softened indeed, but of the same character, did his beautiful daughter and her aged mother look out upon the storm that was gathering and raging around them, and pray heaven for favor on the cause, feeling thankful for the quiet they were permitted to enjoy while that cause was now trying by battle and blood. It was therefore rather a melancholy habit into which she had grown, than a decided pleasure, which led Isabel to the daily observation of her wild flowers and her garden. Often, as she wandered among them at still evening, she would stand and listen with a beating heart, as the noise of cannon rolled on her ear from the distant city, and her thoughts would fly to her bleeding country, and she would go in and weep with her mother, as these dreary signals recalled to their minds the image of the husband and the father. `In the situation they were in, it can hardly be expected that their habitation escaped the notice of the British parties which were scouring the country in every direction. Nor was it passed unheeded. But its very situation was the surest pledge of its protection. The lonely condition of its inmates, the meek and quiet spirit with which it necessarily surrendered the little hospitality which it could afford, and the silent, but sorrowful sympathy which its helpless inhabitants accorded to their suffering country, conciliated the respect even of their enemies, and Isabel Vaughan and her lonely parent found friends in those who had sworn vengeance against their land, and were now passing through it with violence. Sometimes, indeed, the abrupt appearance and unceremonious demeanour of the uncultivated and ferocious soldier, awed them into a painful sense of their apparently unprotected state, and their unfortunate position in a part of the country extremely liable to the commotions of the period. But the troops that passed that way were taught to regard the spot as exempt from the privilege of violence, and strictly charged to refrain from any injury of its peaceful and retired occupants. The leaders of the small parties that passed that way in the course of their excursions, gay, and free of speech and manner as they come to be in camp and in the ardor of war, still found, that in this humble retreat, they were invariably chastened into that quiet respect, which strict and fearless virtue never fails to command; and the presence of Isabel Vaughan always excited a feeling of regard, transient though it might be, while the recollection of her carried with it a degree of undefined interest, into the most careless bosoms among them. It was not strange, therefore, if the impression made even upon such hearts on such occasions, should sometimes go with them to the garrison, and that reports should follow of certain fair ladies in the wilderness, and beauty hard by, as worthy a respectful bumper, as any to be found over the water. It required but a short time for sentiments like these, escaping even as they did like bubbles from the surface of volatile recollections, to have their due effect in exciting the curiosity, that under such circumstances is never too prone to slumber. `Thus, the presence of a beautiful girl in such a beautiful and fairylike seclusion, could not long remain a secret with those finer hearts, whose existence passes under the alternate sway of love and glory; and but few evenings had elapsed after the cottage had first opened its lowly doors to its enemies, when Isabel, from her garden, saw a person approaching, whom, by his dress, she presumed to be an officer of rank. It was not an unusual occurrence that her solitude should be thus broken in upon; but they were perilous and hurried times; strange and terrifying tales had lately found their way to their retreat; the sense of the helplessness of herself and her mother was pressing daily more and more upon her; and, at this moment, her mother was alone, and twilight was fast closing in. Her impulse was to retreat rapidly; but the stranger approached by a side path, and was before her, as she was about to enter the door. With a slight, graceful bow he begged her to remain one moment, and pardon his abrupt approach; soldiers were unused to apologies, and they were not things to be conned, at that day. Besides, he was sorry to say, he believed he was in an enemy's country—beautiful as it appeared. A faint smile mingled with the blush of Isabel, as she received the acknowledgment, and, stepping hastily forward, invited the stranger to enter, and partake of the poor, but only hospitality which their humble roof could afford either to friends or foes; for she innocently conceived that nothing more sentimental than forage could have induced a soldier, even such an one, at such a time, to seek a spot so unimportant and secluded. `Murray, for that was the name of the youthful officer, was unexpectedly embarrassed. He had heard that in this wild and romantic retreat there was a specimen of beauty worthy a sphere far above the humble one in which it shone, and which was fitted to prove attractive to an ardent and sensitive mind; but he was not prepared to find one there whose extreme loveliness forced itself upon him at once, and whose whole appearance could captivate an eye, that had been by no means inactive, in its time, among the fair and favored of his own land. He did not come to see one whose presence could at once dispel all the lighter feelings and intentions with which youth and warm hearts, in his adventurous course of life, approach the shrine of beauty; and he little expected, when he entered the unprotected home of a female with a soldier's freedom and an enemy's license, that he should find there a person, before whom the idea of such freedom made him feel abashed, and whose simple and unconstrained manner demanded his perfect respect, and singularly engaged his attention. Isabel's attractions were the attractions of nature and simplicity, mingled with a clear perception 15* of propriety, and the graces of a well directed and well informed mind. Taste lent all its aid to strong and elevated feelings, and formed a character and presence that could not fail of inspiring more than common interest. `Under the impression of an interview and feelings, therefore, for which he was so little prepared, Murray was unexpectedly confused; and when he found himself under the roof that had so frequently opened its unresisting doors to those whom he commanded, and thought of the possibility of violence done, or insult offered there, and then glanced his eye upon the interesting form before him, he hardly knew how to extenuate the incivility and sin of his intrusion. In despair of any effectual explanation, he referred in a hurried manner, to the fears he entertained of any difficulties or troubles that had been occasioned there by the rough and importunate soldiery; they were in some degree under his command; he felt answerable for them; and concluded with assuring the family ample protection in future from all further annoyance as far as his powers would permit. The assurance was received with a thankful but a distant spirit. Isabel's was a mind not easily drawn away, or driven by sudden feelings from its propriety. She had observed Murray's embarrassment, and sought to relieve it, at once, as far as she could, for it was as painful to her to observe, as it was to him to bear it. The warmth and kindness of manner in which this was done had struck him, and he remembered it. But Isabel looked upon her guest as an enemy. She had been taught to do so; and it had, she thought, grown into an antipathy. It was difficult to overcome these things, and though the stranger recommended himself strongly to her, by his striking demeanour, his conversation, and the generosity of his sentiments, standing in the relation he did to them, and the country they honored, still he was an enemy, and she believed it was impossible that relation could ever be forgotten. The interview, however, begun with so much uneasiness on the part of Murray, became interesting to him. The coldness of the stranger gave way to the native glow of his temperament, and his conversation kindled into gaiety. The intercourse was new to him. It was divested of all that had sickened him elsewhere. It was the employment of his mind. On the other side, Isabel, though not gay, became insensibly interested and even animated when her mind and her feelings were brought into direct collision with what she honored and esteemed, wherever she met them—talent and enthusiasm. She even forgot the individual while she paid respect to his sentiments. `Murray, in extending the offer of his protection, spoke of the defenceless character of the country. “`Why will you touch us there,” said Isabel, “while you have driven us to these things, in the midst of our want of means and our deprivations? but,” continued she, recollecting her father, “there is a defence, which perhaps you cannot see, in strong hearts and clear consciences.” “`Pardon me, pardon me!” said Murray hastily; “I surely forget where I am, to speak of such subjects here; but within these walls, I hope I shall not be considered an enemy; I hope we shall never meet as such.” Then recollecting himself he added—“if, indeed, we should ever meet again.” “`Alas! sir,” said Isabel “you are our superiors; and a prohibition, I fear me, would be of little avail, while the foe holds our land under the law of the strongest.” “`If then, there is no prohibition,” returned Murray warmly, “I shall surely take every fair advantage which the war offers.” “`We are unused to command,” said Isabel, calmly, and with a faint smile. “`Not so unused,” whispered Murray to himself; “for I obey you already.” `Murray departed. He had been a delighted witness of the beautiful simplicity of this little family, and the loveliness of the young creature that adorned it, and he quitted the house with feelings of mingled admiration and regret. He was a person of that free and unprejudiced spirit, that acknowledged worth and bowed to it wherever he found it, from an innate love of virtue. His was a spirit too noble to be restricted to the modes of admiration which the society he rose in avowed and practised, and whether he met it in the gay metropolis of a foreign land, or on the borders of the forests of a new one, he gave his heart, undisguisedly, to the homage of virtue and purity in woman. His was the ardent spirit that saw readily and believed unhesitatingly. In Isabel Vaughan, therefore, he saw enough even in a first single interview, to delight him, because he saw that which reconciled itself at once with the high and generous conceptions he had formed of valuable character, and which he had loved to contemplate. If his spirit was a rapid stream, it was also a deep one; unlike those that are oftentimes shallow in proportion to their velocity. `The recollection of that interview retained a vividness in the mind of Murray, that soon convinced him the repetition of it was necessary to his peace. His avocations, his duties, his pleasures grew dull, and time hung like a weight upon him. If he smiled at the idea of a passion, it was the secret smile of satisfaction, and he felt no disposition then to check its young career. The introduction, therefore, such as it was, was duly improved. Murray found himself, in a few weeks, the welcome and even the cherished guest of Isabel and her mother; for Isabel discovered that time was fast robbing her of the prejudice which she had heretofore believed was her unalienable inheritance. It was a truth, indeed, of which that unsuspecting girl was not yet aware—as who would be, in her situation?—that she was ignorant of her own heart. She did not seem to recollect the miraculous operation of the affections, the wayward course and transforming power of the passions. Least of all did she think that the deep fountains of her bosom could be broken up, by an influence that worked unseen and almost unknown, until the waters suddenly burst the control in which they might otherwise have slumbered forever. With her, as with every woman, love had been a dream, but a beautiful and glorious one, and one which she tremblingly hoped to realize. But that she should realize it in Murray, that her fate should be thus mysteriously linked with his, was more than she had thought of. It was more than she could believe. But when, after many continued interviews, each more anxiously looked for, and each more tenderly recollected than that which had preceded it, she breathed the low voiced confession to her own bosom, then it was that she first woke to the power and progress of her passion. It is needless to follow its course. It may be enough to say that but few months had flown over the lovers, and the peaceful home of Isabel, and all its blooming and blushing flowers witnessed their plighted faith. “`I can scarce believe it,” whispered Isabel, smiling through her tears, “my lover, George, and yet my enemy!” “`Never! my most beautiful foe; this treaty merges country and all!” cried Murray. `Isabel Vaughan was now happy; and, in the pure warmth of her heart, “As guileless as unpractised infancy,” she gave free and joyous way to this new current of thought that went brightening and exulting before her in all the delicious transparency of a first and holy passion. She felt that she loved, before she considered the object of her admiration; and when she did so, she felt her resentments die within her. She thought of the time when she had unconsciously hated the very sound of “Briton;” and to recoil from him, as from an enemy, she remembered, had been a part of the great doctrine of the day, inculcated in her hearing; and now she found her affections were clinging to such a man; that her heart was entwining itself with such a heart, and that she was secretly vowing herself to an enemy, to the desolater of her house, perhaps to the murderer of her father. She went to her mother, and confessed, and wept with her. She felt that every interview had only linked her fate more indissolubly with his, for Murray had now become the almost constant companion of Isabel and her mother. `As often as duty permitted him, he glided from the city, to linger round this fair shrine of beauty, amidst the flowers, and silence, and innocence which embosomed it. He loved Isabel with a high and honorable love. Often with that mother and daughter, in the hushed evenings, did he mourn, as a soldier should mourn, the fate which made him an enemy to the country they were proud of; and often would he be ready in the fulness of his heart to renounce all remembrance of national enmity, till some sullen roar recalled his scattered feelings, and he remembered with sternness that he heard the voice of his country calling him to his faith and his vows of honor. Often, when the moon rode high, and the head of Isabel reclined on his bosom in the bower that she had hung with blossoms and wild leaves, would he part her dark hair and whisper over her an abjuration of glory and even of his country, to give himself up to her and happiness in that little paradise of retirement and peace. But these were dreams of love. These were the words of deep, impassioned feeling. They are those which every heart has felt and every heart has uttered, in its moments of abandonment. They are the simple elements, the infant movements of the heart, developed, and carried out, in the first, the best, the holiest expressions which the soul lends to the lips. They are nature; they are truth. `But the story of love is an oft told tale. I will not detain you to recount its thousand little incidents and misgivings; its trifles, swelled into the importance of events, and the numerous fluctuations of its hopes and fears. I will pass them over. We will leave them to their early troth, to the full fruition of their morning promises and joys, to join the parties again at an advanced period of their fortunes. Far other things were now to engage the attention of the young soldier. Howe was about to evacuate New York, and draw off his forces for Philadelphia, and Murray must accompany his regiment. The golden string must be parted. “Glory,” said he, “is little better than blood, and honor is a shadow that we are chasing over the graves of our fellows. Ambition, if it wins the laurel, how often does it return with a marble brow, and wreathed in cypress!” “`And these flowers,” said Isabel, “must fade just at the moment when they began to look brightest in my eyes, and these buds must be checked in their promise, for I have no heart to cherish them now. Strange! that he has such an influence on my little Eden here— and yet he is one of those who were enemies of my father!” `Such were the unsophisticated movements of this young and unsullied heart. So strong an attachment could not suffer a sudden deprivation without an uncommon and painful struggle. “`We must part in a few days, Isabel,” said Murray. It was two nights before his intended departure. There was no answer returned. “Tomorrow night, Isabel, is the last night I may ever see you.” There was no answer, but the agonized girl was upon his bosom in tears. “But,” said she, at last, calmly looking into his face, “you said you should return; and you then spoke of our never parting again. Let us believe that and be happy.” It was now Murray's turn to be agitated. His manner had evidently been constrained. When he came, he was thoughtful and pale. He now became hurried and abrupt. “`But, Isabel, who may talk to us of returns and welcomes? The chances of life are doubled against us. Fate plays hard with us, Isabel. We can promise nothing; we can hope nothing; we must go where life is doubtful, and dishonor worse than death; and yet that dishonor might save the life of those we love! Curse, curse on the alternative!” Murray wrung her hand, and Isabel was startled at his vehemence. The last words, uttered in a lower tone, caught her attention, and she kindled as she spoke, “What is it you say, George? You talk of dishonor and alternatives; what have they to do with you, or you with them? Why talk of them in my presence? Is there any proposal I am to listen to in which either of those words are implicated? If so, you may yet learn how firmly I can say farewell. My father knew not hesitation where such terms were mentioned, and his daughter—” “`For God's sake, Isabel, no more, no more;” and he cast on her a look that convinced that trembling girl how deeply she had wronged him by her wild and hurrying suspicions. She now stood in the attitude of one imploring forgiveness. “Nay, Isabel,” murmured he, as with a trembling hand he threw back her dark and disordered hair, “I will say nothing of the injustice you have done me. This is no time for cruel words or wounded feelings. I must leave you. A return here, by our commander, is spoken of as something possible; but the war goes on with a varied success. I can see nothing certain through this gloom, and there are dangers and difficulties in our way that you know nothing of.” And again he grew thoughtful and troubled, as he walked away, and his bosom rose and fell as though he was struggling for mastery with some powerful and terrible emotion. “Dishonor!” breathed he to himself, “did she conceive her fame was trying me in this way? Alas! if she knew the horrible trial of defending it.” Suddenly, by one of those despairing exertions of which we are sometimes capable, he turned and approached the agitated Isabel with a composed mein and a faint smile. “`But why, my beloved girl, why anticipate all this sorrow? I shall see you again. I will come to you once more; tomorrow, tomorrow at twilight, I shall be with you. Yet should the hurry of departure prevent even this short interview, for short it must be, still you shall hear from me. Close at the little landing under the cliffs, the Palisadoes, you shall find my messenger. You remember the boat I have so often employed to convey word to you. You will find it there at dark. Remember—not too early—descend the winding footpath to the sands, and receive, and send me in return, a few words; a few words, Isabel! merely a farewell. The fellow is trusty; he will find me. And now,” as he VOL. I. 16 spoke, Murray gently lifted from her neck a beautiful and delicate picture. He gazed on it. “It will speak to me, Isabel, when I am gone, and admonish me, and cheer me; and it shall be my shield,” said he, as he placed it upon his heart. Isabel bowed in silence over it. She believed that heart was beating in single and utter devotion for her; last of all did she believe that the sentiments of the world, the voice of man, could quicken or retard its pulsations. She believed everything that woman should believe, and she was happy. Still it was the happiness of tears; the happiness of a bewildered and anxious bosom. In a few moments those pulses seemed still; her arms fell gently upon her breast; she heard a murmur that sounded like a farewell, and the noise of a door closing at her side. She looked up, and Murray was gone. `The next day rose heavily on Isabel. The winds played rudely among her flowers, and swept hoarsely over her wild blossoms, bending them to the ground. She thought she saw her own fate shadowed out in these frowns of nature upon some of her fairest works. She compared herself with every delicate plant that she saw crouching under the blast, and in the clouds that sailed, dull and dim, along the leaden sky, she pictured strange forms, that seemed to scowl upon her out of their gloomy shrouds. Her haunted fancy ached with painful and distressful anticipations. She recalled the mysterious manner in which Murray had parted from her. She thought of the doubts he had expressed about meeting her, and she resolved them into a thousand realities. She remembered his broken and singular manner, and her excited imagination teemed with forms of terror, peculiar to the dangerous and heart rending scenes to which his profession was the direct and deadly pathway. She endured all that a young and sensitive and devoted spirit may be supposed to suffer in solitude, surrendered to its loneliest reflections, and led, by a deep, and before unfelt interest in a loved individual, to throw around him all its fairy work of hopes and fears, to repose in him all her sacred promises of joy, and all her wishes of future happiness, while that object is away, beyond her control or her knowledge, and exposed to the saddest chances of the world, the additional hazards of a desolating war, and the deadly wrath of man. The day thus passed on, wearisome and lonely. Nature seemed to mourn with this frail and interesting creature, who was gazing for hours upon its lights and shadows. The sun shone out sometimes, but it was with a sad and discolored beam. The breezes came as usual, but they wafted away the perfume, and went off in hollow sounds down the valley. Some of the sweetest flowers that Isabel loved to tend were beaten down and withered; and the roses showered their drooping leaves round the door, and in at the windows. The birds used to linger among the trees, but now they flew silently over the garden, and the hum of the bees was not heard there. It is not strange that melancholy presentiments crowded round Isabel in her cheerless retreat. She saw the sun go down with a faint and sullen light, and she waited with anxious and indescribable feelings for the coming twilight. At times she listened with intense earnestness that she might hear footsteps coming on the wind; but the solitude only deepened as the shades of evening stole in, and yet Murray came not. “`It is past the twilight,” said she to herself, as she paced along the brink of the Palisadoes; “it is past the twilight, and time he were coming; but I will surprise him. My white dress shall not betray me on these cliffs;” and she wrapped a light tartan cloak about her, and stood back from the summit and gazed out upon the deep and far Hudson, as it rolled its chafed waves upon the shore. There was nothing to be discerned. The stars were here and there to be seen peeping from among the clouds as they went driving over the heavens, and as her eye wandered among them, her bodings of ill seemed to derive fresh confirmation from the troubled appearance of the elements. Yet again she took courage when she thought how much was to be charged to her busy and melancholy imagination, and, by an effort, she succeeded in stilling the throbs of her heart, and waited in calm patience for evening to gather in, believing that a short time would put a period to her suffering anxiety. Meanwhile, enough could be gathered by eye and ear from the elevated situation which she occupied, to convince Isabel that the busy note of preparation had sounded in the camp, and that a hurried and bustling night was to pass in the city. Often, as the rising wind swept over the long reach of waters and the crags, there came, borne upon its wings, the faint roll of the drums, and sometimes the long, deep, reechoing peal of guns, sending their muttering signals far and wide, till they died in the murmurs of the small waves, or the moan of the breeze. Then there might be seen, curving upwards far into the air, a sudden, distant line of light, illumining the horizon for a moment, and then sinking with a lengthened train over the distant and mustering city. A brilliant, dazzling star would then hover over the metropolis, and as suddenly vanish, to be succeeded by some other fiery telegraph. Then there would come again the swelling noise of the drum, as the air freshened for a moment, and over and above all, the small, but clear strain of the bugle would float away, like notes of glorious music, even to the clouds. There was something strangely wild and solemn in this scene, and Isabel felt all her enthusiasm wake within her as she beheld and listened. The rocket and the horn seemed to bring Murray once more before her, and her vivid associations for a moment annihilated the very rocks and seas that lay between them. But, as if on the instant to turn her vision of fancy to the still more blessed reality, an object can be descried making its way to the shore. A boat approaches. Drawing as far back as possible without losing sight of the boat, which was making rapidly in on the strength of four oars, Isabel gazed unseen upon its movements. A doubtful and wondering sensation seizes her, as she discovers four persons are hastily disembarking. She feels satisfied that one of them is Murray; but why come so attended? Darkness cannot aid her; it is now too late to retreat. If she stirs into the twilight, she will be discovered. While she remains in silent astonishment, the party has disappeared in the little recess at the foot of the path that leads from above. They are certainly about to ascend. She listens. The sound of low, quick voices comes up—an interval of silence— and the sharp report of pistol shots rings along the rocks. A shriek answers its echoes above, and a white figure is seen rushing down the narrow path to that enclosure. Meantime there is hot haste upon the shore. The boat is immediately filled, and hurryingly shoved off from the bank. It has hardly entered the stream, when a sullen plunge of something overboard is heard. A confused dashing of oars, and the boat has disappeared in the closing gloom of the evening. `And there is Isabel upon that now dark and silent shore! She is bending over the grass as though in search of something, and dull smoke wreaths are curling over her head, among the branches of the trees, and against the old rocks. She has caught at something which the ray of a star lighted for a moment. She 16* grasps it—it is her own picture! The string that bore it is severed, and drops of warm blood are resting on its lineaments. Another long thrilling shriek rings along those cliffs, and the agonized girl falls on her face, alone, and motionless. `From that long and deadly swoon, Isabel Vaughan never returned to earth the same being that she was. The stroke had reached her heart, and all its impulses were paralysed. Her mind withered, and her reason fled, and over the waste there played the flickering, unearthly light of ruined hopes and blasted peace, like that which wanders round decay, amidst tombs and solitudes. Well might we then say her sorrowful fears were truly, beautifully, but sadly fulfilled. She was, indeed, the blossom cut off, the flower bowed down. She was the unsullied flower of the light, scathed on the stalk; the delicate bud crushed into the dust, while it gave rich promise of expanding into beauty. Well did she fear for her bower and her home, when she saw the leaves, and the bloom that enveloped them, falling to the ground, and leaving their habitations cold and desolate. Her spirit was now the rifled and desolate dwelling. Well did she fear for the clouds, and the hollow winds, and the tearful lustre of the sinking sun! The deep mist had come over her soul. The music of death was ringing through the chambers of her heart, and the sacred fire of intellect was expiring in its ashes! `Still Isabel was spared. Still that fair, pale relic of loveliness was left to gaze upon, and to wonder and weep over. Did you seek her at the now afflicted retreat, where she had first learned to love, you would find her, an attenuated form, culling sweet flowers, “To twine into wreaths,” she said, “for her young soldier.” Then they were to scatter over his grave; and sometimes she would smile through her tears, and say they were gathered for her bridal. But did you see her, as I have often seen her, in the neighborhood of those frowning Palisadoes, you saw a different, but never a more heart rending object. Often at nightfall, when I have strayed towards the crags in days long past, I have seen Isabel Vaughan standing like a statue upon the heights, her long hair floating on the evening wind, and her almost vanishing figure shaking as she drew her tartan round her, and gazed wistfully over the Hudson. I have seen her gesticulate on the brink of the cliffs, at one moment as though she was reproaching some one near her, and at the next, urging him to keep silent and listen. `One evening I had watched her till my eyes ran over with tears. She was standing in the same spot, talking wildly and rapidly with herself, and her manner was more estranged than usual. In moving towards the footpath that laid below, she passed me, but expressed no surprise at my presence. She observed my tears. “Why do you weep?” said she; “you have nothing to weep for; but here are flowers; they always comfort me; they used to comfort him;” and she offered me some wild blossoms. “But,” said she, drawing near me, and looking wistfully in my face, “think you the water is deep, and do you know what has changed its color? And they tell me, too, that he sleeps below there; but we wont believe it; he is yonder—yonder—I know it,” and she pointed off towards the city; “and you know he told me to write him farewell, and I send every night by the boat. Come! here are more flowers. Take more flowers!” With these words she turned from me, and passed down the footway, singing, as she went, an incoherent and mournful air, that stole up in low and plaintive cadences as she wound into the dell. With painful interest I watched her movements. It was now near dusk, and I saw her issue from the little recess of low woods, and stand upon the very brink of the river. I had followed her down, and could not but notice now the deep melancholy of her mind. Yet she shed no tears. She raised her hands to her brow, and looked for a long time under them at the still waters. At length she slowly drew from her bosom a small folded paper, and murmuring a few indistinct words, threw it forth upon the waves, as far as her feeble strength would permit. Her eye, and all her faculties seemed to follow it as it floated away, with an intensity that betrayed in a manner distressfully palpable, the “total eclipse” of that beautiful mind. “There, there,” continued she, in a deep and rapid voice, “be sure you carry it to him; it is a farewell, and he charged me to send it. Be quick, or it will go out with the tide, and tell him,” cried she, sending her voice out into the darkness, “tell him, I have been waiting a long time for an answer, and when he comes, tell him to come alone, for they would not let him stay when he came last, and it broke my heart, and now they say I am mad;” and once more the wild notes of her monotonous song rose from the shadowy shore. I accompanied her home that night, and returned her to her weeping and heartbroken mother. `Often, in the dewy twilight did I witness that scene, under those dreary Palisadoes. Often have I seen her little white messengers tossing and eddying upon the current, as she thought them cheerily on their way to her lover. Frequently, at the break of morning, I have seen her fragments of paper circling within reach of the shore, or floating in upon that point towards which your attention was directed. On one occasion I had the curiosity to draw one of these singular missives from the water. It bore a black seal, and was impressed with some little love conceit that I could not construe. With care I succeeded in opening it, without injury. It was evidently written in haste. There were but few words, and they ran thus:— “`Farewell, George, farewell! you charged me to write farewell—but you will return when the army comes back. I heard the drums last night when you went. Farewell! Here is some of my hair. See how white it has grown! all my hair is white; for something strange has passed over my head, and I can feel it now! Farewell—the boat is coming—farewell!” `Over these incoherent and almost illegible words lay a portion of hair, white as the paper which had enfolded it, and a few rose leaves, dry and withered. `For many weary months, almost nightly, did Isabel Vaughan haunt those high rocks of the Hudson. She seemed to grow wilder, as time went by, and although when met elsewhere, a settled melancholy was to be observed, wearing her slowly away, yet upon the Palisadoes, she roamed along with starts and gestures increasingly violent and frantic. `The season was getting to be bleak and cold. The leaves were beginning to drop from the trees, and the flowers round Isabel's dwelling had all closed up and fallen from their places. It was the time of decaying nature. Still the poor maniac glided nightly along the cliff, heedless of the elements. She was beyond the reach of the things of earth. `The British had returned to New York. There was high mustering again in the city, and the noise of war again broke upon the startled land. Again the distant drum might be heard to roll its far summons, coming like a murmur on the ear, and again the roar of ordnance pealed over the hills and rivers, calling the frighted inhabitants to the recollection of past horrors, and the anticipation of others yet to come. `It was one of those chill and piercing evenings which I have described, when, following my wayward inclination, I wandered as usual to the Palisadoes. True to her melancholy associations, Isabel was there, upon the upper rock, gazing with an appearance of uncommon interest towards the city. I thought I could discover a new expression lighting up her pale countenance. A distant shot rolled away upon the wind. A few rapid words escaped her, and she was again silent, listening and looking with increasing earnestness. The note of a bugle was then wafted upon a rising gust. It was answered by a scream, and she clapped her hands and tossed them madly over her head. “He is coming! he is coming!” cried she. “I hear his music. Hush! Isabel, you must not betray yourself. Remember! `not too early, Isabel,”' and she drew back from the verge, and became silent. A brilliant light illuminated for a moment the horizon towards the south, and as she caught its glare, she cried, “It is his signal! there was one like that before!” and a convulsive laugh burst from her lips. As it died away, I saw her sink upon the rocks till she seemed crouching upon the brink of the precipice, and gaze with her hands raised to her brow, in the eager and bewildered manner I had before noticed, as though she would penetrate farther by thus shading her eyes in that uncertain light. A sound like the dipping of oars drew my attention. I turned, and saw a boat slowly making its way under the cliffs where we stood. At that moment another terrifying shriek broke upon the stillness—“I come, George—I am here—here!”—and as I again turned in horror, a dim white object was seen plunging into the abyss between me and that now solitary cliff! There could be no mistake—she was gone! With a beating heart, I leaped down the path. I fancied I heard a low moan; it might have been the wind, but there was no time to listen. When I reached the dell, there were feet passing hastily to and fro, and as I approached I saw some one kneeling. He was at the side of Isabel! “It is too late!” said the stranger—“I saw her fall as I sprang from the boat; but she smiles even in death. Poor Murray! poor Murray!” “You knew him, then,” said I; “you know something of this sad tale.” but I could ask nothing. I kneeled to gaze upon the corpse. She lay within a few feet of the grave of her lover. Her countenance was but slightly mutilated; scarcely at all; but her long white hair, that had been bleached by sorrow, lay upon her bosom, buried in blood. `The stranger was an elderly British officer. As he seemed to be deeply affected by the harrowing spectacle before us, and as I had heard him mention the name of Murray in a tone of compassionate and melancholy recollection, I concluded he might acquaint me with some matters relating to this sad history, of which I remained ignorant. In a few words he informed me that he was the friend of the unhappy young man, who met his untimely fate on the dark spot where we then stood. There were broken hints, a confused story of hasty words between Murray and another—of some unholy attempt to fix a stigma on the pure fame of Isabel Vaughan. The sin of insult—such insult! could be washed away only by blood. The infatuation had its full effect. God was forgotten, and man obeyed, and we have seen the issue! Murray fell, and the villain triumphed! The wound proving instantly mortal, the victorious fiend—for he could be nothing less than a fiend—through fear of detection, or in the delirium of guilt, flung the bleeding corpse of his adversary into the waves, and hurried from the scene. “`This then must be his grave,” said I, pointing to the low mound at our feet; “she spoke of some one buried here, and a grave that they had told her about.” “`To learn the certainty of that fact was the motive that brought me hither,” returned the stranger. “I had heard something of the humble burial of an officer whose body was found hereabouts, soon after; but, as our forces were hurried away, I was constrained to delay inquiry till this eventful evening. As for him who laid him low in that narrow house,” continued he, “he has long ago expiated his crime. He was discovered— how could it be otherwise?—and died ignominiously.” `The stranger looked long and mournfully upon the grave of his young friend. He spoke in a manly, but feeling tone, of the warm but mistaken spirit that had driven him to this wretched end, and expressed a sorrowful satisfaction in finding that his remains had been committed decently to the earth. “This is a wild, but sacred place for him to slumber in,” he said. “Let him rest! He will not be forgotten.” Having offered the assistance of his party, we bore the ghastly form of Isabel to the dwelling it once adorned. Description would falter, in presenting the scene of that hapless home; of that mother, beside her lifeless daughter! The veil is dropped. `Isabel Vaughan and George Murray sleep side by side, in that green dell beneath the Palisadoes. There is nothing to mark their graves, but a little mound, with a foot and head stone. The tale is too melancholy for marble; but it is engraven in lines of terror upon the recollection of those who have survived those stormy times. Tradition, not content with the gloomy character of the facts, whispers of secret murder committed in those shades, and points to those graves as spots where dark handed violence, the dagger of an assassin, sent down its victim to oblivion; and the Christian, the man of God, with the truth of this sad story yet green in his memory, still tells you of murder done there, and with pious eloquence depicts to you, glowing, exasperated, and guilty youth rushing to the hazard, with crime in his heart and death on his lips, to prove his respect for man, by daring the laws of the Almighty. There is a mystery in these things; let the world think of it, if it will. It is not my business to employ the warning voice of the preacher; but I tell you, that for many years, young men and maidens, the curious, the gay, and the sorrowful, from all the country round, made frequent and silent pilgrimage to the Red Graves of the Hudson.' THE HAUNTED WOOD. BY I. M'LELLAN. I ofttimes hide in this lonely place, And forget the stir of my restless race; Forget the woes of human life, The bitter pang and the constant strife, The angry word and the cruel taunt, The sight and the sound of guilt and want, And the frequent tear by the widow shed, When her infants ask in vain for bread. All these I put from my mind aside, And forget the offence of worldly pride. It is said that the spirits of buried men Oft come to this wicked world again; VOL. I. 17 That the churchyard turf is often trod By the unlaid tenants of tomb and sod, That the midnight sea itself is swept By those who have long beneath it slept; And they say of this old, mossy wood, Whose hoary trunks have for ages stood, That every knoll and dim lit glade Is haunted at night by a restless shade. It is told that an Indian king, whose name Hath perished long from the scroll of fame, And whose thousand warriors slumber low, In equal rest with the spear and bow, Was wont to pursue the fallow deer, And hold his feasts, and make merry here, And seek his repose in the noontide heat, By the noisy brook at my very feet— And here, at the close of his sternest strife, He finished his rude and unquiet life. It is said that on moonlight nights, the gleam Of his battle spear flits o'er this stream; And they say there 's a shiver along the grass Where the restless feet of the spectre pass, And a rustle of leaves in the thicket's gloom When he nods his dusky eagle plume. And, methinks, I have heard his war horn bray, Like the call of waters far away, And his arrow whistle along the glade Where the chieftain's giant bones are laid. And yonder, where those gray willows lave Their silvery tassels beneath the wave, By the hollow valley's shadowy tide, You may trace the grave of a suicide; And 't is said, at the noon of a dewy night, When the hills are touched with a silver light, That a spirit leans o'er that lonely turf, Like a snowy wreath of the ocean surf, And a sound, like a passionate mourner's cry, Will often startle the passer by. THE DOOMED SHIP. Lightly the south wind kissed the sea, As it slept in deep tranquillity, And the crescent moon was bathed in light, Like a silver loop of the curtained night, And the stars were twinkling bright and high, Like human eyes, in the ample sky. Along the shore of the beautiful bay, The Kazie ploughed on her stately way; The spray was dashed from her cleaving prow, And fell like gems to the wave below, And the mariners laughed with joy to see The track she left on her foaming lee. Time glowed on its axle. Away like light The hours had fled in their traceless flight. The ship had entered the heaving main, And sullenly ploughed the untrodden plain The sailors slept; but the face of the sky Was darkened by clouds that were coming nigh, And the vessel rocked to the rising swell, And the sails flapped loose, or idly fell, And the helmsman's brow grew troubled fast, As the giant clouds went driving past. Now, as far on the sea as the sight could lie, Where the ocean joined to the stooping sky, Seen dim through the mist like the moon in her wane Strange gleamings of light flashed again and again A moment—the blood, like electrical light, Rushes back on the heart—the Doomed Ship is in And up to the sky went a shrieking of fear, As the light on her quarter flashed fearfully near. Ah! well may the gray haired seaman tell The tale of that vessel he knows so well; That the spirits of some who were murderers at sea On the deck of that ship are known to be, With a sense of life and a perishing thirst, On the sight of the living in storm they burst, Forever in chase, with a fearful way, Of relief for whose coming they may not stay. Nearer, still nearer, their shouts are heard; They are chasing a ship with the speed of a bird The furrow is deep in the waters they sever— And the ship they pursue has gone down forever! On came the prison of souls to view, Enveloped in clouds of a fiery hue; Her bellying sails gave way to the blast, And bent the lithe topsail and stately mast, While in strong relief on the lurid glow, Was painted each spar of the `mariner's foe.' On—fearfully on!—the warm blood froze As the shriek of undying thirst arose— An instant—she passed! and the trough of the sea Received the trim form of the gallant Kazie. Another—and like the fleet swallow that flings On the blue summer heaven his rapturous wings, The gallant Kazie to the waters leant, And sprang on her course like a shaft well sent. The mariners still, with a trembling lip, Tell the stirring tale of the fated ship, Yet still do they venture abroad on the sea, And tread the trim decks of the gallant Kazie. 17* THE INDIAN WIFE. BY THE AUTHOR OF HOBOMOK. —May slighted woman turn, And as a vine the oak hath shaken off, Bend lightly to her tendencies again? Oh, no! by all her loveliness, by all That makes life poetry and beauty, no! Make her a slave; steal from her rosy cheek By needless jealousies; let the last star Leave her a watcher by your couch of pain; Wrong her by petulance, suspicion, all That makes her cup a bitterness—yet give One evidence of love, and earth has not An emblem of devotedness like hers. But oh! estrange her once, it boots not how, By wrong or silence, anything that tells A change has come upon your tenderness— And there is not a high thing out of heaven Her pride o'ermastereth not. WILLYS. Tahmiroo was the daughter of a powerful Sioux chieftain; and she was the only being ever known to turn the relentless old man from a savage purpose. Something of this influence was owing to her infantile beauty; but more to the gentleness of which that beauty was the emblem. Her's was a species of loveliness rare among Indian girls. Her figure had the flexile grace so appropriate to protected and dependant woman in refined countries; her ripe, pouting lip, and dimpled cheek wore the pleading air of aggrieved childhood; and her dark eye had such an habitual expression of timidity and fear, that the young Sioux called her the `Startled Fawn.' I know not whether her father's broad lands, or her own appealing beauty, was the most powerful cause of admiration; but certain it is, Tahmiroo was the unrivalled belle of the Sioux. She was a creature all formed for love. Her downcast eye, her trembling lip, and her quiet, submissive motion, all spoke its language; yet various young chieftains had in vain sought her affections, and when her father urged her to strengthen his power by an alliance, she answered him only by her tears. This state of things continued until 1765, when a company of French traders came to reside there, for the sake of deriving profit from the fur trade. Among them was Florimond de Rancé, a young, indolent Adonis, whom pure ennui had led from Quebec to the Falls of St Anthony. His fair, round face, and studied foppery of dress might have done little toward gaining the heart of the gentle Sioux; but there was a deference and courtesy in his manner, which the Indian never pays to degraded woman, and Tahmiroo's deep sensibilities were touched by it. A more careful arrangement of her rude dress, an anxiety to speak his language fluently, and a close observance of European customs soon betrayed the subtle power, which was fast making her its slave. The ready vanity of the Frenchman quickly perceived it. At first he encouraged it with that sort of undefined pleasure, which man always feels in awakening strong affection in the hearts of even the most insignificant. Then the idea that, though an Indian, she was a princess, and that her father's extensive lands on the Missouri were daily becoming of more and more consequence to his ambitious nation, led him to think of marriage with her as a desirable object. His eyes and his manner had said this, long before the old chief began to suspect it; and he allowed the wily Frenchman to twine himself almost as closely around his heart, as he had around the more yielding soul of his darling child. Though exceedingly indolent by nature, Florimond de Rancé had acquired skill in many graceful arts, which excited the wonder of the savages. He fenced well enough to foil the most expert antagonist, and in hunting, his rifle was sure to carry death to the game. These accomplishments, and the facility with which his pliant nation conform to the usages of savage life, made him a universal favorite, and at his request, he was formally adopted as one of the tribe. But conscious as he was of his power, it was long before he dared to ask for the daughter of the haughty chief. When he did make the daring proposition, it was received with a still and terrible wrath, that might well frighten him from his purpose. Rage showed itself only in the swelling veins and clenched hand of the old chief. With the boasted coldness and self-possession of an Indian, he answered, `There are Sioux girls enough for the poor pale faces that come among us. A king's daughter weds the son of a king. Eagles must sleep in an eagle's nest.' In vain Tahmiroo knelt and supplicated. In vain she promised that Florimond de Rancé would adopt all his enmities and all his friendships; that in hunting, and in war, he would be an invaluable treasure. The chief remained inexorable. Then Tahmiroo no longer joined in the dance, and the old men noticed that her rich voice was silent, when they passed her wigwam. The light of her beauty began to fade, and the bright vermillion current, which mantled under her brown cheek, became sluggish and pale. The languid glance she cast on the morning sun and the bright earth, entered into her father's soul. He could not see his beautiful child thus gradually wasting away. He had long averted his eyes, whenever he saw Florimond de Rancé; but one day, when he crossed his hunting path, he laid his hand on his shoulder, and pointed to Tahmiroo's dwelling. Not a word was spoken. The proud old man, and the blooming lover entered it together. Tahmiroo was seated in the darkest corner of the wigwam, her head leaning on her hand, her basket work tangled beside her, and a bunch of flowers, the village maidens had brought her, scattered and withering at her feet. The chief looked upon her, with a vehement expression of love, which none but stern countenances can wear. `Tahmiroo,' he said, in a subdued tone, `go to the wigwam of the stranger, that your father may again see you love to look on the rising sun, and the opening flowers.' There was mingled joy and modesty in the upward glance of the `Startled Fawn' of the Sioux; and when Florimond de Rancé saw the light of her mild eye, suddenly and timidly veiled by its deeply fringed lid, he knew that he had lost none of his power. The marriage song was soon heard in the royal wigwam, and the young adventurer became the son of a king. Months and years past on, and found Tahmiroo the same devoted, submissive being. Her husband no longer treated her with the uniform gallantry of a lover. He was not often harsh; but he adopted something of the coldness and indifference of the nation he had joined. Tahmiroo sometimes wept in secret; but so much of fear had lately mingled with her love, that she carefully concealed her grief from him who had occasioned it. When she watched his countenance, with that pleading, innocent look, which had always characterized her beauty, she sometimes would obtain a glance such as he had given her in former days, and then her heart would leap like a frolicsome lamb, and she would live cheerfully on the remembrance of that smile, through many wearisome days of silence and neglect. Never was woman, in her heart breaking devotedness, satisfied with such slight testimonials of love, as was this gentle Sioux girl. If Florimond chose to fish, she would herself ply the oars, rather than he should suffer fatigue; and the gaudy canoe her father had given her, might often be seen gliding down the stream, while Tahmiroo dipped her oars in unison with her soft, rich voice, and the indolent Frenchman lay sunk in luxurious repose. She had learned his religion; but for herself she never prayed. The cross he had given her was always raised in supplication for him; and if he but looked unkindly on her, she kissed it, and invoked its aid, in agony of soul. She fancied the sounds of his native land might be dear to him, and she studied his language with a patience and perseverance to which the savage has seldom been known to submit. She tried to imitate the dresses she had heard him describe; and if he looked with a pleased eye on any ornament she wore, it was always reserved to welcome his return. Yet, for all this lavishness of love, she asked but kind, approving looks, which cost the giver nothing. Alas, for the perverseness of man, in scorning the affection he ceases to doubt! The little pittance of love for which poor Tahmiroo's heart yearned so much, was seldom given. Her soul was a perpetual prey to anxiety and excitement; and the quiet certainty of domestic bliss was never her allotted portion. There were, however, two beings, on whom she could pour forth her whole flood of tenderness, without reproof or disappointment. She had given birth to a son and daughter, of uncommon promise. Victoire, the eldest, had her father's beauty, save in the melting dark eye, with its plaintive expression, and the modest drooping of its silken lash. Her cheeks had just enough of the Indian hue to give them a warm, rich coloring; and such was her early maturity, that at thirteen years of age, her tall figure combined the graceful elasticity of youth, with the staid majesty of womanhood. She had sprung up at her father's feet, with the sudden luxuriance of a tropical flower; and her matured loveliness aroused all the dormant tenderness and energy within him. It was with mournful interest he saw her leaping along the chase, with her mother's bounding, sylphlike joy; and he would sigh deeply when he observed her oar rapidly cutting the waters of the Missouri, while her boat flew over the surface of the river like a wild bird in sport—and the gay young creature would wind round among the eddies, or dart forward, with her hair streaming on the wind, and her lips parted with eagerness. Tahmiroo did not understand the nature of his emotions. She thought, in the simplicity of her heart, that silence and sadness were the natural expressions of a white man's love; but when he turned his restless gaze from his daughter to her, she met an expression which troubled her. Indifference had changed into contempt; and woman's soul, whether in the drawingroom or the wilderness, is painfully alive to the sting of scorn. Sometimes her placid nature was disturbed by a strange jealousy of her own child. `I love Victoire only because she is the daughter of Florimond,' thought she; `and why, oh! why does he not love me for being the mother of Victoire?' It was too evident, that De Rancé wished his daughter should be estranged from her mother, and her mother's people. With all members of the tribe, out of his own family, he sternly forbade her having any intercourse; and even there he kept her constantly employed in taking dancing lessons from himself, and obtaining various branches of learning from an old Catholic priest, whom he had solicited to reside with him for that purpose. But this kind of life was irksome to the Indian girl, and she was perpetually escaping the vigilance of her father, to try her arrow in the woods, or guide her pretty canoe over the waters. De Rancé had long thought it impossible to gratify his ambitious views for his daughter, without removing her from the attractions of her savage home, and each day's experience convinced him more and more of the truth of this conclusion. To favor his project he assumed an affectionate manner towards his wife; for he well knew that one look or word of kindness would at any time win back all her love. When the deep sensibilities of her warm heart were roused, he would ask for leave to sell her lands; and she, in her prodigality of tenderness, would have given him anything, even her own life, for such smiles as he then bestowed. The old chief was dead, and there was no one to check the unfeeling rapacity of the Frenchman. Tracts after tracts of Tahmiroo's valuable land were sold, and the money remitted to Quebec, whither he had the purpose of conveying his children, on the pretence of a visit, but in reality with the firm intent of never again beholding his deserted wife. A company of Canadian traders happened to visit the Falls of St Anthony, just at this juncture, and Florimond de Rancé took the opportunity to apprise Tahmiroo of his intention to educate Victoire at one of the convents in Quebec. The Sioux pleaded with all the earnestness of a mother's eloquence; but she pleaded in vain. Victoire and her father joined the company of traders, on their return to Canada. Tahmiroo knelt and fervently besought that she might accompany them. She would stay out of sight, she said; they should not be ashamed of her, among the great white folks at the east; and if she could but live where she could see them every day, she should die happier. `Ashamed of you! and you the daughter of a Sioux king!' exclaimed Victoire proudly, and, with a natural impulse of tenderness, fell on her mother's neck, and wept. `Victoire, 't is time to depart!' said her father sternly. The sobbing girl tried to release herself; but she could not. Tahmiroo embraced her with the energy of despair; for, after all her doubts and jealousies, Victoire was the darling child of her bosom—she was so much the image of Florimond when he first said he loved her. `Woman! let her go!' exclaimed De Rancé, exasperated by the length of the parting scene. Tahmiroo raised her eyes anxiously to his face, and she saw that his arm was raised to strike her. `I am a poor daughter of the Sioux; oh! why did you marry me?' exclaimed she, in a tone of passionate grief. `For your father's lands,' said the Frenchman coldly. This was the drop too much. Poor Tahmiroo with a piercing shriek fell on the earth, and hid her face in the grass. She knew not how long she remained there. Her highly wrought feelings had brought on a dizziness of the brain; and she was conscious only of a sensation of sickness, accompanied by the sound of receding voices. When she recovered, she found herself alone with Louis, her little boy, then about six years old. The child had wandered there, after the traders had departed, and having in vain tried to waken his mother, he had laid himself down at her side, and slept on his bow and arrows. From that hour Tahmiroo was changed. Her quiet, submissive air gave place to a stern and lofty manner; and she, who had always been VOL. I. 18 so gentle, became as bitter and implacable as the most blood thirsty of her tribe. In little Louis all the strong feelings of her soul were centered; but even her affection for him was characterized by a strange and unwonted fierceness. Her only care seemed to be to make him like his grandfather, and to instil a deadly hatred of white men; and the boy learned his lessons well. He was the veriest little savage that ever let fly an arrow. To his mother alone he yielded anything like submission; and the Sioux were proud to hail the haughty child as their future chieftain. Such was the aspect of things on the shores of the Mississippi, when Florimond de Rancé came among them, after an absence of three years. He was induced to make this visit, partly from a lingering curiosity to see his boy, and partly from the hopes of obtaining more land from the yielding Tahmiroo. He affected much contrition for his past conduct, and promised to return with Victoire, before the year expired. Tahmiroo met him with the most chilling indifference, and listened to him with a vacant look, as if she heard him not. It was only when he spoke to her boy, that he could arouse her from this apparent lethargy. On this subject she was all suspicion. She had a sort of undefined dread that he too would be carried away from her; and she watched over him like a she wolf, when her young is in danger. Her fears were not unfounded; for Florimond de Rancé did intend, by demonstrations of fondness, and glowing descriptions of Quebec, to kindle in the mind of his son a desire to accompany him. Tahmiroo thought the hatred of white men, which she had so carefully instilled, would prove a sufficient shield; but many weeks had not elapsed, before she saw that Louis was fast yielding himself up to the fascinating power, which had enthralled her own youthful spirit. With this discovery came horrible thoughts of vengeance; and more than once, she had nearly nerved her soul to murder the father of her son; but she could not. Something in his features still reminded her of the devoted young Frenchman who had carried her quiver through the woods, and kissed the moccasin he stooped to lace, and she could not kill him. The last cutting blow was soon given to the heart of the Indian Wife. Young Louis, full of boyish curiosity, expressed a wish to go with his father, though he, at the same time, promised a speedy return. He had always been a stubborn boy; and she felt now as if her worn-out spirit would vainly contend against his wilfulness. With that sort of resigned stupor, which often indicates approaching insanity, she yielded to his request, exacting, however, a promise that he would sail a few miles down the Mississippi with her, the day before his departure. The day arrived. Florimond de Rancé was at a distance on business. Tahmiroo decked herself in the garments and jewels she had worn on the day of her marriage, and selected the gaudiest wampum belts for the little Louis. `Why do you put these on?' said the boy. `Because Tahmiroo will no more see her son in the land of the Sioux,' said she, mournfully, `and when her father meets her in the Spirit Land, he will know the beads he gave her.' She took the wondering boy by the hand, and led him to the river side. There lay the canoe her father had given her when she left him for `the wigwam of the Stranger.' It was faded and bruised now, and so were all her hopes. She looked back on the hut, where she had spent her brief term of wedded happiness, and its peacefulness seemed a mockery of her misery. And was she—the lone, the wretched, the desperate, and deserted one—was she the `Startled Fawn' of the Sioux, for whom contending chiefs had asked in vain? The remembrance of all her love and all her wrongs came up before her memory, and death seemed more pleasant to her than the gay dance she once loved so well. But then her eye rested on her boy—and, O God! with what an agony of love! It was the last vehement struggle of a soul all formed for tenderness. `We will go to the Spirit Land together,' she exclaimed. `He cannot come there to rob me!' She took Louis in her arms, as if he had been a feather, and springing into the boat, she guided it toward the Falls of St Anthony. `Mother, mother! the canoe is going over the rapids!' screamed the frightened child. `My father stands on the waves and beckons me!' she said. The boy looked at the horribly fixed expression of her face, and shrieked aloud for help. The boat went over the cataract. Louis de Rancé was seen no more. He sleeps with the `Startled Fawn' of the Sioux, in the waves of the Mississippi! The story is well remembered by the Indians of the present day; and when a mist gathers over the Falls, they often say, `Let us not hunt to day. A storm will certainly come; for Tahmiroo and her son are going over the Falls of St Anthony.' ANGLING. BY I. M'LELLAN. From thicket to thicket the angler glides. BRYANT. `There is no life so pleasant as the life of a well governed angler,' exclaimed that experienced prince of fishermen, old Izaak Walton. `The merchant may be deprived of his merchandise, and the project of the political calculator may be thwarted, and the endeavours of the poor scholar baffled; but the happiness of the fisher shall be perfect so long as there is plunder in the standing pool or in the running brook.' I delight exceedingly, in imagination, to accompany that gentle old man abroad in his various rambles, and listen to the enthusiastic panegyrics he is perpetually bestowing upon the cunning art to which he was wedded; and am most charmed with his fervor, when, after the heat and dust of a midsummer day, he sits at the threshold of the little inn he loved to frequent with his gossips, and recounts the victories of his rod, while he enjoys his smoking tankard of `nut brown ale,' with its inseparable `burnt toast and roasted crab apple.' He has drawn so delicious a picture of the contentment and quietness of rural life, of the holy and subduing influence which the contemplation of beautiful scenes and quiet pursuits exercise upon the mind, that one is tempted to renounce the ordinary bustle and business of men, and assume the garb and the implements and the demeanour of an angler. 18* I have not unfrequently, when under the spell of this gray headed wizard, been lured away into the wilderness, `Where nothing 's to be seen but hills And rocks that spread a hoary gloom, And that one beast, that from the bed Of the green meadow hangs his head Over the silent stream.' Rejoicing to yield myself up entirely to the mysterious and sombre influence of the place, sometimes reclined upon a knoll of the yellow moss, I have contemplated for hours the wonderful beauty and perfection of the heavens above, and the profound repose and harmony of the earth around, regarding with delight each individual feature in the landscape. There is a sensation of awe experienced in beholding the magnificent and eternal rock, fissured and weather stained, presenting a myriad of fantastic shapes, the broken precipice, the slender pinnacle, and the shattered fragment, and a thrill of pleasure, in tracing the gloomy and silent glen, wandering up into the very heart of the hills far beyond the stretch of the bewildered vision. It is also refreshing to the eye to penetrate the mysterious depths of the flood, and observe the motions of its innumerable tenants. In some places the water lies as clear and transparent as the noonday atmosphere, so that even the minute pebbles and shells and sand drifts are disclosed; and in other places, where the surface is somewhat obscured by the shadows of the trees, the element rather resembles the uncertain gloom of the autumnal twilight. Thus my enthusiastic love for old Walton remained unabated so long as I was content to feast upon his `Ancient Treatise,' and bury myself among those pastoral haunts which he had first taught me to admire; but at length even these objects began to lose somewhat of their interest, and I resolved to equip myself with all that formidable apparatus so indispensable to the art, and declare myself a sworn `brother of the rod.' Accordingly the wicker basket, the tapering rod and line, and cunning tackle were provided, and I opened my aquatic campaign; not, however, without bearing about me, as prime counsellor of the cabinet, my illuminated copy of Walton, and consulting it carefully before venturing any decisive movement. The day I had selected for my expedition was precisely one of those quiet, temperate, and somewhat clouded seasons, half shade, half shine, which old Walton would not have exchanged for riches; no, `not for much fine gold.' There was a little obscurity in the atmosphere, that rendered gloomier the hollow places underneath the banks where the trout are accustomed to lurk; and at such times they are known to take the bait most eagerly, because the gloom of the water renders them less wary, less liable to detect the shadow of the sportsman and the cheat of the fly bait. There was a lazy motion in the southern wind, barely sufficient to crisp the surface, without violently agitating the tranquility of the water. Speaking of the wind, old Izaak very curiously and quaintly remarks, that `The wind from the south Blows the bait in the fishes mouth.' I commenced my career by searching one of those sluggish currents, whose perpetual drowsy murmur exercised, oftentimes, a wonderfully narcotic influence upon the senses even of the keen, determined Father of the Rod himself. In places where its surface lay exposed to the day, you might look down into its transparent depths, and be almost persuaded that the reflected image of the bird or the insect above it, is really a winged tenant of the stream, so perfectly is every color that lies on its wing reflected from the transparent mirror. How delightful is the illusion that presents to the eye countless images of the inhabitants of the air, apparently living and sporting with the creatures of another element. There is a surpassing beauty in such a scene, that reminds one of those wonderful regions of fairy land, in the tales of Eastern enchantment. I secreted myself in an obscure, cunning little thicket, at the rivulet side, and patiently awaited that happy moment, when freak, or appetite should seduce some devoted rover to my angle; but in vain. Not even a knot of yellow and red liveried perch, whom I at first contemned as prey too ignoble for my rod, appeared to regard me with any degree of interest. The loitering knaves even affected to despise my craftily fashioned fly, the identical species of bait recommended by the illustrious Walton himself, and represented by him as absolutely irresistible to any honest fish. However, a dastardly fear, I suspect, occasioned this unnatural indifference, for I detected sundry wistful glances cast by some of them at my deceitful fly, which incontestably betrayed their inclination, though their timidity prevented its gratification. It is now with shame and confusion that I must confess my utter want of success; for the perpetual drip, drip, dripping of the current completely overpowered my senses, and the rod gradually slid away from my relaxing grasp, and the sound of the water course became fainter and yet fainter in my ear, and the perception of surrounding objects more indistinct, and at last I was completely wandering and lost in `the Land of Dreams.' And such is the history of my angling experience. It is a very delightful thing to search the brook, and capture the monarch of the stream, in your meditations over that bewitching `Treatise' of the simple hearted Izaak Walton. But, in good truth, it is a most wearying and fruitless pastime; it is searching in vain for `dainty trout' in our ill-stocked waters, to the total discomfiture of one's equanimity, and the lamentable ruin of expensive apparatus. ASCUTNEY. BY MRS A. M. WELLS. In a low white-washed cottage, overrun With mantling vines, and sheltered from the sun By rows of maple trees, that gently moved Their graceful limbs to the mild breeze they loved, Oft have I lingered; idle, it might seem, But that the mind was busy; and I deem Those moments not mispent, when, silently, The soul communes with Nature, and is free. O'erlooking this low cottage, stately stood The huge Ascutney. There, in thoughtful mood, I loved to hold with her gigantic form Deep converse; not articulate, but warm With the heart's noiseless eloquence, and fit The soul of Nature with man's soul to knit. In various aspect, frowning on the day, Or touched with morning twilight's silvery gray, Or darkly mantled in the dusky night, Or by the moonbeams bathed in showers of light— In each, in all, a glory still was there, A spirit of sublimity; but ne'er Had such a might of loveliness and power, The mountain wrapt, as when, at midnight hour, I saw the tempest gather round her head. It was an hour of joy, yet tinged with dread. As the deep thunder rolled from cloud to cloud, From all her hidden caves she cried aloud; Wood, cliff, and valley, with the echo rung; From rock and crag, darting, with forked tongue, The lightning glanced, a moment laying bare Her naked brow, then, silence—darkness there! And straight again the tumult, as if rocks Had split, and headlong rolled. But Nature mocks At language. These are scenes I ne'er again May look upon; yet precious thoughts remain In memory's silent store; and in my heart Still, mid all other claims, that mountain hath its part. TELLING THE DREAM. BY W. G. CROSBY. 'T is a most beauteous night! Ianthe, come! Wilt thou walk forth? Oh! I am sick at heart Of this gay revelry. Its busy hum Falls heavy on mine ear. I cannot laugh With these light hearted laughers, and mine eye Is wearied with gazing. Let me fling Thy mantle round thee. Is 't not beautiful! The radiance of this starry sky? How pale, And lustreless are all we've left behind, Compared with its bright jewelry! Perchance Chaste Dian holds her festival tonight. See, how she smiles! On such an eve as this, So the tale runs, she left her home in heaven, Lured thence to meet upon the Latmian hill Her shepherd boy, and placed upon his lips The kiss of immortality! Poor youth! He only dreamed of bliss. On such a night, The love crazed Sappho poured her latest song, Upon Leucate's height, and swan-like died. She dreamed—but dreamed too madly! And, perchance, On such a night, the Roman Antony Threw off the crown and purple, and gave up Glory, dominion—for a wanton's smile! He was a dreaming madman—was he not, Ianthe, thus to fling his all away, For woman's smile? Come, rest within this bower, And I will tell thee, though thy lips may chide, And call me `Dreaming boy.' Yes, I have dreamed— Perchance and dreaming now; but thou shalt hear. I had lain down to slumber on a bank Sprinkled with violets. The plaintive moan Of far off waters, mingling with the hum Of thousand busy insects, gathering in Each its own store of sweets, filling the air With melody, spread its sweet influence O'er my lulled senses, and methought that I Was wandering here, with thee! 'Twas strange, Ianthe! But then the time, the place, so like to this, I cannot but remember. 'Twas a night Like this, save that it wore the loveliness And richness of a dream o'er all its charms. The sporting moonbeams twined themselves around The leaves and branches of the o'erhanging trees, Like ivy round the mouldering monument— Half seen, half hid—and from their azure depths, The stars were looking out with eyes that watch O'er Nature's slumbering. We had left the hall To lighter hearts, and arm in arm had strayed Through the long winding mazes of the grove, Until, at length, we reached this bower. One beam Of moonlight, streaming through its trellised roof, Fell on thy cheek; methought it never looked One half so lovely—and, indeed, till now, It never did, Ianthe! And then I— Strange, that my brain should dream what my tongue fears To utter even now!—'twas but a dream, However, and the masquers are not gone, So I'll e'en finish it—Well then, methought, I told thee, though 'twas in a whispered breath, And softer than the night wind's gentlest sigh, How I did love—that was the word—did love, And even worship thee! And then I swore, By Venus, and the starry train above— By thy bright eyes, which did outrival them— By all love's fond remembrances, that I Would guard and cherish thee, wouldst thou but be My own, my own Ianthe! And then—then— Heed not my passionate dreaming—I did seal My vow upon thy lips; and then I watched To see them open, and to hear thy voice, Steal forth in gentle murmuring, like the tone Of a sigh that hath found utterance. Then I twined Mine arm around thee—thus; and placed thy cheek Upon my bosom—thus; and bade thee tell, Though 't were but with a glance, or place thy heart Upon thy lips, and breathe it in a kiss, If I might dare to love; and then thine eyes Peered up through their dark lashes, with a look So tender, yet so melancholy, and Thy lips just parted with a sigh—and then— And then— Do dreams always prove true, Ianthe? THE SISTERS. It was on the thirtyfirst of December, 1779, that an alarm of fire was given in Paris. It was soon ascertained that one of the most distinguished convents was in flames. The building was inhabited by about three hundred nuns, many of them descended from families of high rank. The greatest efforts were made to save the lives of these unfortunate women. The governor of Paris, with the chief magistrates, hastened to the spot; but, as the fire began in the sleeping rooms of the nuns, they were enveloped in flames before they were aware of their danger. Horrible indeed was the scene. The shrieks of the sufferers, mingling with the hoarse shouts of the populace—the shadowy forms of the nuns seen tottering upon the rafters, stretching out their hands for aid that no human power could afford them—then all at once sinking among the crash of ruins, was too dreadful to gaze upon. Dismay took possession of the spectators, and when the last wing of the building fell, a suppressed murmur of horror arose from the multitude, followed by a profound silence. VOL. I. 19 It was many days before the impression of this scene wore away from the minds of the restless and busy Parisians. Accounts were published of the victims who had perished, and the few who were saved were received into other convents. Among the sufferers was Theresa de Sèligny, a young lady of high birth. Her fate excited the deepest interest in the circle in which she had moved, and even the thoughtless and hard hearted gave a sigh to her memory. It is well known how often, in former times, the younger sisters of families have been sacrificed to the splendid establishment of the first born. Theresa was one of these distinguished beings. She was taught from her infancy that the honors and wealth of the family were to centre in her; that at a suitable age she was to be allied to the young Marquis de Lucerne, who was a descendant of kings, while Louise, her younger and only sister, was told, in a manner equally peremptory, that she was destined to take the veil. It is not difficult to impress the minds of children, and give to their future destiny almost the color of fate. Theresa early assumed the state of a marchioness. Though naturally of an amiable and gentle disposition, the seeds of vanity and caprice were early sown, and their usual fruits, arrogance and selfishness, sprung up. Louise, on the contrary, lived in perfect retirement, and already appeared like a devotee. Both of the sisters, however, had been equally perverted by education, and both were alike actuated by ambition. The one dreamed of worldly honors, of dress, of jewels; of giving the tone of fashion and elegance to all Paris; of making the spacious Chateau de Lucerne, that seat of ancient, and consequently somewhat gloomy grandeur, of which at twenty she was to become the mistress, a gay and modern court, over which she was to preside as its imperial queen. The nun, too, dreamed of honors; but they were to be won by renouncing the very world that was to consummate her sister's splendor; her path to glory was to be by sacrifice, by humiliation and prayer; her crown to be a crown of thorns. Already she looked forward to the supremacy of the convent, to be the distinguished successor of the Lady Abbess. Her rank, the influence of her parents, and her own zeal, all promised distinction, and an ambition not more purified than her sister's, though differently directed, burnt in her heart. In external appearance, nature had apparently suited herself to their different vocations, but it is difficult to say how much effect education and a habitual train of thought may produce. `Train up a child' in the way you mean he shall go, is a maxim of profound policy. Theresa was brilliant and commanding; Louise delicate and shrinking. Thus far the plans of the parents had been peculiarly successful. Their eldest born was all they desired. When she appeared in public, at the theatre, the opera, or the drawing room, she received involuntary homage. At public gardens people clustered to see her pass; but her parents were among the most devoted of her worshippers. That fountain of affection which springs up in the heart found but one channel; Louise was scarcely thought of or regarded. In her own apartment, which her youthful zeal had arranged like the cell in which her future life was to be passed, she counted her beads, said her pater nosters and believed herself a saint, because she worshipped the graven image of that being whose virtues while on earth ought to have modelled her life. With her sister's dreams of ambition, none of love or domestic happiness mingled. She thought of the young Marquis as one who was to pay her daily homage; who was to die when she frowned, and come to life again when she smiled. She was fully determined to make her husband her prime minister; to consult his taste where it was not decidedly opposed to her own, and to do him credit by the arrangement of their splendid establishment. Such was the system Theresa had formed, when the Marquis de Lucerne returned from his travels, which were to give the last polish to his education. It was now that the betrothed lovers met for the first time. The young Marquis was evidently struck by the beauty and elegance of Theresa. No timidity as to the effect she might produce mingled with the lofty and dignified manner in which she received him. It was as if a queen might say to her followers, `I admit you among my train!' Lucerne had been confined to no narrow school of aristocracy. He had travelled on the continent, and resided many months in England. He had studied the genius of the nation, and above all, the genius of man. The voice of liberty had burst forth in America. He had been the associate of Pitt and of Burke, and had learnt that there is a spirit in man, which teacheth him inspiration. It was with a degree of loathing that he thought of fulfilling a contract made by his parents in the bondage of childhood, and he fully determined to reserve to himself the liberty of decision. When his eye, however, rested on Theresa, and he beheld her in the brightness of her beauty, he forgot the inalienable right of man to judge for himself, and felt almost willing to yield his freedom. A few days' intercourse, however, convinced Lucerne that there was a wide contrast in their characters and feelings. He grew impatient at her requirements, and indignant at her caprices, and was often glad to quit her presence, and wander forth into the solitude of the garden. It was in one of these walks that he perceived a door in a wall standing open. He passed through it, and, descending a few steps, found himself in a small apartment, containing a table, a crucifix, a death's head, and an hourglass; and prostrate before the altar lay a form of living beauty and interest. He could not doubt that it was Louise. He had never before seen her, and hardly remembered that such a being existed. She appeared to be performing some act of penance; for she groaned bitterly, and her tears fell fast. He stood silent and immoveable; but when she took a cross, armed with innumerable points, and, opening her bosom, seemed preparing to place it there, an involuntary exclamation escaped his lips. Louise hastily dropped the instrument of torture, and arose. The Marquis did not hesitate a moment in his conviction, that the young lady before him was the second born, and the destined nun. He made some apology for his accidental intrusion, but begged that he might no longer be a stranger to one so nearly connected with the family. `Allow me,' said he, `sometimes the pleasure of your society.' `My time,' said she, in a low voice, `is short. I have much preparation to make before I enter the year of my noviciate. It would ill become me to form associations that would drag my spirit to the earth. I remember both you and my sister in my daily prayers.' As she spoke, however, she quitted the little cell, and, accompanied by Lucerne, walked slowly in the pathway. It was sunset, and every object seemed fresh from the hand of the Creator. The perfume of a `thousand flowers,' of orange blossoms, acacias, and sweet scented exotics, floated on the air. 19* `I cannot reproach myself,' said Lucerne with emotion, `for interrupting your devotions in that narrow cell; for here, in the temple of nature, the heart and imagination must have but one direction.' Louise mournfully shook her head. `It is there,' said she, `lies my weakness. In a spot like this, it is not the Creator, but his works, I adore. We are prone to forget the First Cause, and rest only in realities; but the time is near when I trust these struggles will be over. I would gladly now shut out worldly objects in the convent where my future pilgrimage is to be passed; but I have promised Theresa, that I will spend the few months with her previous to her marriage.' `Is it,' exclaimed the Marquis with animation, `by excluding the works of the Creator, that we can best learn to love him? Is it in a narrow cell, and shut out from the glorious light of day, that we feel most sensibly the power of his presence?' `Natural objects,' said Louise, `have their use; but the effect of these on the mind is low and grovelling, compared with the holy mystery of the cross, the incarnation, and blessed sacraments of the church. It is not by walking in orange or myrtle groves; it is not there that we trace the sufferings of a crucified Redeemer. It is prostrate before the cross to which he was nailed, and in the depths of our own hearts, that we feel our worthlessness, and find resolution to inflict upon ourselves punishments that may mitigate the pains of purgatory. Blessed Saviour of the world!' she exclaimed, `may these eyes become sightless balls when they shall be content to gaze on thy works, and forget thee in thy passion and thy cross!' Lucerne shuddered. It were a work worthy a human being, thought he, to redeem a creature so noble from the darkness of superstition. He intreated Louise to mingle in her family circle, to give her friends the privilege of conversing with her the short time they were to pass together. `It is inconsistent with my future vocation,' she replied. `The mind is but too easily seduced by material objects, and engrossed by worldly thoughts; and if it is filled, where can God find a place. It is only,' she continued, `quand Dieu trouve des vaisseaux vides, il y verse libéralement ses bénédictions célestes.' `At least,' said Lucerne, `it must be the office of saints and angels to instruct the ignorant and benighted. Cannot your benevolence find its exercise in this work? Suffer me to come to your cell, and listen to your instructions. What is so flattering to ambition as power and patronage!' The eye of Louise flashed with momentary brightness, and its meek and disciplined expression was changed to exultation. Lucerne marked the change of countenance, and followed the advantage he had gained. She was persuaded to suffer him to visit her cell at those hours of the morning when the inhabitants of the chateau were sleeping off the effects of late hours, and the dissipation of the preceding evening. It was then that Lucerne wandered forth, animated by the breath of morning, but still more by the enthusiasm of his own heart, and by benevolent affections that teach man the value of existence. There was nothing clandestine in these visits. They walked under the shade of the trees, and Theresa was perfectly willing her lover should devote those hours to her sister which she passed in oblivion; and it was not till evening that she claimed his homage. In the mean time, the zeal of Louise increased with her hopes. The conversion of Lucerne became her first object. For this she knelt before the crucifix, and pressed it to her lips and her bosom. She forgot the humbling sense of her own sins, that had so often drawn tears of anguish from her eyes, and called for self-inflicted torments. It seemed as if a new spirit of martyrdom had seized her, and she was willing to sacrifice even the care of her own salvation for the redemption of Lucerne. Her countenance had lost the pale, meek expression which had marked it from childhood. Her eyes sparkled with unwonted vivacity, and her cheek mantled with a bloom that threatened to rival the artificial brilliancy of her sister's. Could Lucerne be all this time ignorant of the workings of her mind? Woman is born to be the dependant of man; to be subjugated by his influence. They are the ministers of her fate. The good, become her guardian angels; the bad, instruments of torture. The young Marquis could not be ignorant of his power, but he followed the impulse of the moment, and thought not of consequences. Louise no longer refused to listen to the waterfall, because it discoursed eloquently; to gaze on the distant prospect; to examine the insect and the flower through the wonder working microscope, or hear the melody of the birds. When the mind once begins to exercise its reason, its progress is rapid. The young recluse no longer worshipped a God of monastic gloom. Her first consciousness of existence seemed now like `the morning stars' when they `shouted aloud and sang for joy.' One superstition after another was gradually fading away, and though at times she trembled at her own thoughts, yet she seldom repaired to her beads or pater nosters to smother the unholy intruders. It would have been happy for her future peace if she could have received the simple and sublime truths of religion from one qualified to impart them. The vague and indeterminate observations of Lucerne served rather to bewilder, than enlighten her mind. It was at this time that the young Marquis received a summons from his parents to hasten home on acaccount of family arrangements, for which his presence was necessary. The pride and caprice of Theresa had become almost intolerable to him, and he determined to inform his parents of his reluctance to the union, and leave them to dissolve the contract they had formed. When he took leave of her there was little emotion on either side; but the young lady spoke of his return as a circumstance not to be doubted. Indeed it probably never entered the minds of either of the sisters that they could avoid the destiny marked out for them from their infancy. The parting between Lucerne and Louise was of a more sentimental nature. For the first time he pressed his lips upon the hand of the consecrated vestal. She withdrew it as if it were a deadly sin, while her trembling limbs almost refused to support her, and bidding him farewell, hastened to her lonely apartment. For many succeeding days, Louise, to a transient observer, would have appeared the very model of devotion; but Le Père François, who was the family confessor, had marked her with a keener eye. He had seen the effect which worldly interest had produced upon her character, and he read in her tears and sighs, the struggles of a rebellious spirit. It was now that mingling compassion and severity, praise and reproof, he riveted more firmly than ever, the fetters of superstition. `My child,' he said, `thou hast proof in thy wanderings that a convent is thy only ark of safety. Flee to it as to thy strong hold. Let not another week pass over thy head and find thee unsheltered from the storm! Apostles, martyrs, and saints stand ready to receive thee at the door of the sanctuary. Go and reap thy glorious reward!' It was in vain that Louise urged her promise to remain with her sister till after her marriage; the confessor was resolute, and the parents, prompted by a hint from him, united their wishes to his. Theresa tenderly loved her sister, and warmly disapproved the measure; but though she had an habitual disregard for opinions contrary to her own, she trembled to oppose the requirements of one of the fathers of the church; and Louise, with a heart clinging to earth, with those newly awakened affections that first teach us the value of existance, was doomed to pass the fatal threshold. The Marquis, on his return to his parents, communicated to them his unwillingness to ratify the contract they had formed. `It is impossible,' said he, `that there can be any union between us. I love retirement and leisure; her days are passed in company and dissipation. And then again my whole soul revolts against the tyranny and selfish ambition which dooms one sister to a living grave, to aggrandize the other. Louise possesses in her character all that might give grace to domestic life. By allowing her her just and equitable rights, both would be benefited. It was in vain that Lucerne protested and reasoned. His insinuations, which were only darkly hinted with regard to the nun, filled his parents with horror. The contract they considered one of honor, any violation of which would bring disgrace upon their family; and the only boon that the son could obtain, was the delay of another year. He left this second negotiation to his parents, almost hoping that the palpable indifference it discovered might annul the treaty. But in ambitious projects there are only a few prominent points. These were still fair to the eye, and the parents, satisfied, on both sides, that wealth, titles, and lands, would be unit ed, considered the parties merely as appurtenances. Theresa had been educated with the same views, and neither reasoned nor thought on the subject. As to the postponement of the marriage, it was to her a matter of indifference. In the mean time Louise entered on her noviciate at the convent. This convent was one of the strictest order; but the young novice exceeded all others in zeal. Even the pious and exemplary Lady Abbess viewed with astonishment her disregard of sleep and food, and her voluntary penances. Every excitement was presented to her mind by the enthusiastic fanatics. She was compared to Saint Catharine, who was broken on a wheel, and to a host of other saints, who died less enviable deaths. It is not surprising, amidst this horrible excitement, with her heart struggling with worldly recollections, and her frame wasted by penance, that her reason should have tottered on its throne. She began to have strange and wild imaginations; sometimes called herself the mother of God, the `adorable Marie;' sometimes spoke of herself as Jesus Christ, and destined to be bodily crucified a second time. The nuns listened to the wanderings of her disordered mind as to beatific visions. Such extraordinary sanctity could not be concealed, even within the walls of a convent. The sisters talked of her at the grate when their friends came to see her, and it was not long before she was announced as a convulsionnaire.[4] [4] There are many readers of the present day, to whom this class is probably unknown. Those who would wish to see the horrible effects of fanaticism and superstition exemplified, we would refer to the third volume of Grimm's `Correspondence Littèraire, Premièr Partie.' The account is given in a `procèss-verbal dressè par M de la Condamine.' The devotees who professed to be convulsionnaires, were even at this period rare; for it required a fortitude in the endurance of suffering almost beyond human nature. Instances are recorded of feeble and delicate women, who were actually nailed to the cross in imitation of Jesus Christ, and remained in that situation three hours and a half, enduring every species of torture. Others had their clothes burnt on them, and the fire only extinguished when life was in imminent danger. It was in the beautiful province of Languedoc, where Lucerne was passing a few weeks, that he took up a journal containing an account of the `extraordinary piety of the young novice Louise de Sèligny, and second daughter of the noble house of Montserrat, who was to exhibit as a convulsionnaire before a few distinguished friends, on the twelfth day of the ensuing month, about the time of the holy incarnation.' It was with emotion amounting to horror, that he read this paragraph. The year of procrastination had nearly expired, and he did not hesitate a moment to return to Paris. He determined to make one effort to rouse the sensibility of Theresa towards her sister, and to persuade her to reject the sacrifice her parents exacted. It was now that he found, under a thoughtless and dissipated exterior, a feeling heart. The young lady entered warmly into his project, which was to persuade her sister solemnly to protest against taking the vows, even at the altar, if necessary, and to relinquish to her a part of her splendid fortune. The plan was to be kept secret from the parents, that no measures might be taken to defeat it. The most difficult part to accomplish, however, was to persuade Louise herself to renounce a monastic life. This Lucerne had not foreseen; for he knew not that, since his departure, her former impressions had returned with tenfold strength. He spent hours at the grate endeavouring to shake her resolution; but all he could obtain was the promise that she would not exhibit as a convulsionnaire, though he could not doubt that her self-inflicted torments were already unsettling her mind, and destroying her health. Theresa, with generous feelings, devoted a portion of that time to her sister, which had been hitherto wasted upon dress and fashion. It needs but one strong bond of union to connect two young people, thrown together by circumstances. Lucerne had discovered that Theresa had an affectionate heart. A thousand virtues and good qualities, some real, and some imaginary, opened upon his view. He became now as earnest to fulfil the contract as he had formerly been to annul it, and preparations were made for the splendid alliance. The time, too, rapidly approached, in which the fate of Louise was to be decided. The week preceding the marriage of one sister, was appointed for the other to take the veil. It was now that both Theresa and Lucerne exerted all their powers of reasoning and persuasion to induce Louise to protest against the vows. She had ceased to oppose their earnest solicitations, and either maintained an obstinate silence on the subject, or let fall ambiguous phrases, that startled and astonished them. The night previous to the day which was to decide her fate, Theresa declared her intention of passing with her. She was sanguine in the belief that they had won her to their wishes. Lucerne parted with the sisters at the refectoire of the convent. Never had either looked so lovely to him; Louise, pale and emaciated, but her eyes sparkling with supernatural brightness; Theresa, resplendent in beauty; the one clad in the simple white robes of a novice; the other sparkling in jewels and adorned with the drapery of fashion. He embraced Theresa, and would have embraced Louise; but she VOL. I. 20 said, with an air of wildness that chilled him, `Touch me not! I have not yet ascended—.' It was on that night, that dreadful night, that the fire broke out in the convent. It began near the cell of the sisters, and their names were first among the victims! The parents of these unfortunate girls retired to one of their splendid chateaux, and the world ceased to talk of them. Lucerne felt this event most deeply, and for many months he avoided Paris. On his return to the city, he was one day accosted by a friar, whom he recognised as the Confessor of the family of Montserrat. The venerable Father seemed oppressed by recollections too dreadful to be borne, as he gazed mournfully upon the young Marquis. He then hastily put a paper into his hand, and disappeared. It was dated the 31st, the night of the dreadful fire, and written by Louise. It was wandering and unconnected, and like the ravings of a maniac. She declared herself `appointed to consume the world by fire; that the hour was come!' From the dark and unconnected sentences more might be inferred than met the eye. Lucerne, filled with horror, pursued the investigation no further. Silence and mystery rested on the memory of the maniac. THE BRUCE'S HEART. BY THE AUTHOR OF `MORAL PIECES.' The couch of death King Robert prest; His nobles ranged around, With head declined, and troubled breast, To list his latest sound. His temples bathed in painful dew, The fainting monarch cried, `Red Comyn in his sins I slew, At the high altar's side. `For this, a vow my soul hath bound, In armed lists to ride, A warrior to the Holy Ground, Where my Redeemer died. Lord James of Douglas! near me stand, Firm friend in all my care! Bear thou this heart to that blest land, A contrite pilgrim there.' He paused—for on in close pursuit, With fierce and fatal strife, He came, who treads with icy foot Upon the lamp of life. The brave Earl Douglas, trained to meet Perils and dangers wild, Low kneeling at his sovereign's feet, Wept like a weaned child. Beneath Dunfermline's hallowed nave, Enwrapt in cloth of gold, The Bruce's relics found a grave, Deep in their native mould; But locked within its silver vase, Next to Lord James's breast, His heart was journeying on apace, In Palestine to rest, While many a noble Scottish knight, With sable shield and plume, Rode as its guard, in armor bright, On to their Saviour's tomb. Their war steeds pressed the soil of Spain. And lightning fired their eye, To mark, in bold and gorgeous train, Her flower of chivalry. Alphonso 'gainst the invading Moor Drew forth his proud array, And set the serried phalanx sure To bide the battle fray. `God save ye now, ye gallant band Of Scottish nobles true! Good service for the Holy Land Ye on this field may do.' Forth with the cavalry of Spain They rode in close array, And the grim Saracen in vain Opposed their onward way. But Douglas, with his falcon glance, O'erlooking spear and crest, Saw brave St Clair with broken lance, By Moorish foes opprest. He saw him by a thousand foes Oppressed and overborne, And high the blast of rescue rose From his good bugle horn; And, reckless of the Moorish spears, In serried ranks around, His monarch's heart, oft steeped in tears, He from his neck unbound, And flung it to the battle front, And cried with laboring breath, `Pass first, my liege, as thou wert wont— I 'll follow thee to death.' Stern Osmyn's lance was dire that day, And keen the Moorish dart, And there Earl Douglas wounded lay, Upon the Bruce's heart. Embalmed in Scotland's holiest tears, That peerless chieftain fell, And still the lyre through future years His glorious deeds shall swell. `The good Lord James,' that honored name Each lisping child shall call, And all who love the Bruce's fame Shall mourn the Douglas' fall. 20* THE LEGEND OF BETHEL ROCK. In the picturesque State of Connecticut, there is not a spot more beautiful than the village of Pomperaug. It is situated not very far from the western border of the State, and derives its name from a small tribe of Indians, who once inhabited it. It presents a small, but level valley, surrounded by hills, with a bright stream rippling through its meadows. The tops of the high grounds which skirt the valley, are covered with forests, but the slopes are smooth with cultivation, nearly their summits. In the time of verdure, the valley shows a vividness of green like that of velvet, while the forests are dark with the rich hues, supposed to be peculiar to the climate of England. The village of Pomperaug consists now of two hundred houses, with three white churches, arranged on a street which passes along the eastern margin of the valley. At the distance of about forty rods from this street, and running parallel to it for nearly a mile, is a rock, or ledge of rocks, of considerable elevation From this, a distinct survey of the place may be had, almost at a glance. Beginning at the village, the spectator may count every house, and measure every garden; he may compare the three churches, which now seem drawn close together; he may trace the winding path of the river by the trees which bend over its waters; he may enumerate the white farm houses which dot the surface of the valley; he may repose his eye on the checkered carpet which lies unrolled before him, or it may climb to the horizon over the dark blue hills which form the border of this enchanting picture. The spot which we have thus described, did not long lie concealed from the prying sagacity of the first settlers of the colony of New Haven. Though occupied by a tribe of savages, as before intimated, it was very early surveyed by more than one of the emigrants. In the general rising of the Indians in Philip's War, this tribe took part with the Pequods, and a large portion of them shared in their destruction. The chief himself was killed. His son, still a boy, with a remnant of his father's people, returned to their native valley, and lived for a time on terms of apparent submission to the English. The period had now arrived when the young chief had reached the age of manhood. He took, as was the custom with his fathers, the name of his tribe, and was accordingly called Pomperaug. He was tall, finely formed, with an eye that gleamed like the flashes of a diamond. He was such an one, as the savage would look upon with idolatry. His foot was swift as that of the deer; his arrow was sure as the pursuit of the eagle; his sagacity penetrating as the light of the sun. Such was Pomperaug. But his nation was passing away, and but fifty of his own tribe now dwelt in the valley in which his fathers had hunted for ages. The day of their dominion had gone. There was a spell over the dark warrior. The Great Spirit had sealed his doom. So thought the remaining Indians in the valley of Pomperaug, and they sullenly submitted to a fate which they could not avert. It was therefore without resistance, and, indeed, with expressions of amity, that they received a small company of English settlers into the valley. This company consisted of about thirty persons, from the New Haven colony, under the spiritual charge of the Reverend Noah Benison. He was a man of great age, but still of uncommon mental and bodily vigor. His years had passed the bourne of three score and ten, and his hair was white as snow. But his tall and broad form was yet erect, and his cane of smooth hickory, with a golden head, was evidently a thing `more of ornament than use.' Mr Benison had brought with him the last remnant of his family. She was the daughter of his only son, who, with his wife, had slept many years in the tomb. Her name was Mary, and well might she be the object of all the earthly affections which still beat in the bosom of one, whom death had made acquainted with sorrow, and who but for her had been left alone. Mary Benison was now seventeen years of age. She had received her education in England, and had been but a few months in America. She was tall and slender, with a dark, expressive eye, whose slow movements seemed full of soul and sincerity. Her hair was of a glossy black, parted upon a forehead of ample and expressive beauty. When at rest, her appearance was not striking; but, if she spoke or moved, she fixed the attention of every beholder by the dignity of her air, and the tone of tender, yet serious sentiment, which was peculiar to her. The settlers had been in the valley but a few months, when some matter of business relative to a purchase of land, brought Pomperaug to the hut of Mr Benison. It was a bright morning in autumn, and while he was talking with Mr Benison at the door, Mary, who had been gathering flowers in the woods, passed by them and entered the hut. The eye of the young Indian followed her with a gaze of entrancement. His face gleamed as if he had seen a vision of more than earthly beauty. But this emotion was visible only for a moment. With the habitual self-command of a savage, he turned again to Mr Benison, and calmly pursued the subject which occasioned their meeting. Pomperaug went away, but he carried the image of Mary with him. He retired to his wigwam, but it did not please him. He went to the top of the rock, at the foot of which his hut was situated, and which now goes under the name of Pomperaug's Castle, and looked down upon the river, which was flashing in the slant rays of the morning. He turned away, and sent his long gaze over the checkered leaves of the forest, which, like a sea, spread over the valley. He was still dissatisfied. With a single leap he sprang from the rock, and, alighting on his feet, snatched his bow and took the path which led into the forest. In a few moments he came back, and, seating himself on the rock, brooded for some hours in silence. The next morning Pomperaug repaired to the house of Mr Benison to finish the business of the preceding day. He had before signified an inclination to accede to the terms proposed by Mr Benison, but he now started unexpected difficulties. On being asked the reason, he answered as follows:— `Listen, father—hear a red man speak. Look into the air and you see the eagle. The sky is his home, and doth the eagle love his home? Will he barter it for the sea? Look into the river, and ask the fish that is there, if he will sell it? Go to the dark skinned hunter and demand of him if he will part with his forests? Yet, father, I will part with my forests, if you will give me the singing bird that is in thy nest.' `Savage,' said the pilgrim, with a mingled look of disgust and indignation, `will the lamb lie down in the den of the wolf? Never! Dream not of it—I would sooner see her die! Name it not.' As he spoke he struck his cane forcibly on the ground, and his broad figure seemed to expand and grow taller, while his eye gleamed, and the muscles of his brow contracted with a lowering and angry expression. The change of the old man's appearance was sudden and striking. The air and manner of the Indian, too, was changed. There was now a kindled fire in his eye, a proud dignity in his manner, which a moment before was not there; but they had stolen unseen upon him, with that imperceptible progress, by which the dull colors of the snake, when he becomes enraged, are succeeded by the glowing hues of the rainbow. The two now parted, and Pomperaug would not again enter into any negotiations for a sale of his lands. He kept himself, indeed, aloof from the English, and cultivated rather a hostile spirit in his people toward them. As might have been expected, difficulties soon grew up between the two parties, and violent feelings were shortly excited on both sides. This soon broke out into open quarrels, and one of the white men was shot by a savage, lurking in the woods. This determined the settlers to seek instant revenge, and accordingly they followed the Indians into the broken and rocky districts which lie east of the valley, whither, expecting pursuit, they had retreated. It was about an hour before sunset, when the English, consisting of twenty well armed men, led by their reverend pastor, were marching through a deep ravine, about two miles east of the town. The rocks on either side were lofty, and so narrow was the dell, that the shadows of night had already gathered over it. The pursuers had sought their enemy the whole day in vain, and having lost all trace of them, they were now returning to their homes. Suddenly a wild yell burst from the rocks at their feet, and twenty savages sprang up before them. An arrow pierced the breast of the pilgrim leader, and he fell. Two Indians were shot, and the remainder fled. Several of the English were wounded, but none mortally, save the aged pastor. With mournful silence they bore back the body of their father. He was buried in a sequestered nook of of the forest, and with a desolate and breaking heart, the orphan Mary turned away from his grave, to be for the first time alone in their humble house in the wilderness. A year passed. The savages had disappeared, and the rock, on which the pilgrim met his death, had been consecrated by many prayers. His blood was still visible on the spot, and his people often came with reverence to kneel there, and offer up their petitions. The place they called Bethel Rock, and piously they deemed that their hearts were visited here with the richest gifts of heavenly grace. It was a sweet evening in summer, when Mary Benison, for the last time, went to spend an hour at this holy spot. Long had she knelt, and most fervently had she prayed. Oh! who can tell the bliss of that communion, to which a pure heart is admitted in the hours of solitude and silence. The sun went down, and as the veil of evening fell, the full moon climbed over the eastern ledge, pouring its silver light into the valley, and Mary was still kneeling, still communing with Him who seeth in secret. At length a slight noise, like the crushing of a leaf, woke her from her trance, and with quickness and agitation she set out on her return. Alarmed at her distance from home at such an hour, she proceeded with great rapidity. She was obliged to climb up the face of the rocks with care, as the darkness rendered it a critical and dangerous task. At length she reached the top. Standing upon the verge of the cliff, she then turned a moment to look back upon the valley. The moon was shining full upon the vale, and she gazed with a mixture of awe and delight upon the sea of silvery leaves, which slept in deathlike repose beneath her. She then turned to pursue her path homeward, but what was her amazement to see before her, in the full moonlight, the tall form of Pomperaug! She shrieked, and swift as his own arrow, she sprang over the dizzy cliff. The Indian listened—there was a moment of silence—then a heavy sound—and the dell was still as the tomb. The fate of Mary was known only to Pomperaug. He buried her with a lover's care amid the rocks of the glen. Then bidding adieu to his native valley, he joined his people, who had retired to the banks of the Housatonac. More than half a century subsequent to this event, a rumor ran through the village of Pomperaug, that some Indians were seen at night, bearing a heavy burthen along the margin of the river, which swept the base of Pomperaug's castle. In the morning a spot was found near, on a gentle hill, where the fresh earth showed that the ground had been recently broken. A low heap of stones on the place, revealed the secret. They remain there to this day, and the little mound is shown by the villagers as Pomperaug's grave. COLUMBUS. HIS LAST EMBARKMENT FROM THE NEW WORLD, A CAPTIVE. BY J. W. MILLER. Day broke—upon the seaward hills Of Hispan's lovely isles, Bright was the sward with leaping rills, The blushing sea with smiles; And wakening bird, and tree, and wave, To morn a gentle greeting gave. Uprose the Sun—his sudden glance Shot o'er Domingo's bay, And hushed, beneath his red advance, The panting waters lay; And, poured above the voiceless earth A flood of splendor, veiled her mirth. What rushing, as of seas, passed then O'er the deep hush of morn? On that dark, tumbling surge of men What mighty wreck is borne? Along the gleaming shore a cloud Hath flung the darkness of the shroud. Receding, as a weary wave, Rolls back the weltering throng, Yet, as the timid flees the brave, As leaves the weak, the strong, They left him. Hate and ire subdued, He passed amid grief's solitude. VOL. I. 21 Chained captive! Ha! and is it thou, Columbus!—conqueror— Not o'er the warrior's death dewed brow, Not in the blood of war,— Victor! that Error's chain hath rent— To do God's purpose, armed and sent. Columbus, conqueror, whose thought Inspired, and daring soul, Up from deep night a world hath brought! Chosen! is thy control, Victor of elements! thus lost? On man's low passions wrecked and tossed? Even thus;—as melts the crested wave Behind yon lessening bark, Power shrinks into Time's ocean grave, Fame in Oblivion's dark. Yet passeth on that shallop now Greatness, nor Time, nor Death may bow. Stands he upon the narrow deck Of yon lone caravel, Whose tall shape, as with princely beck, Bowed to the heaving swell, And when the conqueror o'er her side Crossed meekly, rose with living pride. The foot, that trod a world alone, Bound to an infant's pace! The arm, a sceptre's rule hath known, Weighed by a chain's embrace! The brow, where Soul hath conquered Time, Bent with foul charge of wrong and crime! Night's lowering vapors melt and flee Before the sun's advance— A light as mighty and as free Broke from the hero's glance; It fell upon the awe struck train— They knelt to loose the captive's chain. What triumph in his meekness shone, When his proud voice was heard— `Good friends, my sovereign's deed alone Might bind—alone his word Shall loose. His thing this mortal clod— The soul but boweth to its God.' Landward, above the yielding trees And whitening beach—the deep Knoweth her steps—comes forth the breeze, As from a morning sleep; And, her broad sail distending well, Rusheth to sea the caravel. Stoopeth her pride beneath the weight The quickening wind hath cast. Waves, bright as hope, grew dark as fate, As seaward strode the blast, And writhed the deep beneath her keel, Like serpent trod by giant's heel. Day sank. Upon the glowing west Rested one faint blue shade. Like the huge swell of ocean's rest When phantom storms are laid, Then turned the hero. On his eye Loomed up his sinking world more high. And in that hour his soul, as erst, Spoke, face to face, with Death, Whose one revealing veil was burst, And rolled back, as a breath; And in the depth of future time, He saw achieved his hope sublime. He heard the echoings of his name Pass to Earth's darkest bound— He heard, on ages' wings, his fame Borne with a ceaseless sound. Thrones, pyramids to dust were hurled, He saw his monument—A WORLD! THE CONSCRIPT BROTHERS. It was in the dark and smoky room of an alehouse, the walls stained by the dirt of years, that three young men were seated at a table. Their coarse and scanty meal stood untasted before them. Their muskets rested against the wall and their knapsacks lay on the floor. The storm beat furiously against the window. The rain had penetrated through the dilapidated building, and gave a still more desolate appearance to the miserable apartment. It was the evening before the battle of Waterloo. A terrible conflict was expected. Many a soldier of Bonaparte's army was fired by the prospect, and waited with all the impatience of military ardor for morning to arrive. Not so our young Conscripts. They had been torn by the imperial mandate from the bosom of their family, from the culture of the sunny vineyard, from the tranquil and simple pleasures that the paysans of France enjoy, and forced into military duty. There was no struggle for freedom to animate them; no anticipation of better days. Their little village had been desolated by their own countrymen, and their father robbed of his three sons by the most cruel despotism. They could not join in the shout of Vive l'Empereur! for they felt only the effects of his blasting and selfish ambition. `Our poor father!' said Conrad, striking his hand on the table. `Our poor sister!' said Philip, while Edward, the youngest, who yet retained the slight form and fair complexion of boyhood, uttered a convulsive sob. `Cheer up, my boy,' said Conrad, `if we must fight, let us fight like men, and die like Christians.' At that moment the landlord entered, conducting a soldier. `Who talks of dying?' exclaimed he, as, full of animation and gaiety, he seated himself at the table; then, casting his eyes around, `for shame! landlord,' said he, `can you give the defenders of your country no better rations than these? Do you not boast of your generous wines? Bring them forth! Don't stint us of Burgundy and Champaigne. Well may these poor fellows talk of dying, when famine and thirst stare them in the face.' The landlord, who had long groaned under the heavy demands of those who had quartered upon him, muttered his dissatisfaction. `Away!' exclaimed the soldier, `do you not know you have the honor of entertaining Fortunatus himself? Now look! whenever I take off my cap and shake it 21* thus, wealth pours from it;' and several pieces of money actually fell upon the table. `God bless your honor,' exclaimed the landlord; `may you often take it off in my house.' `Go, then, poor devil,' said the soldier, throwing him a few francs, `and bring us the best you can find.' The landlord bowed low and disappeared. `I do in my very soul pity these poor fellows,' said the soldier, turning to his comrades; `they are oppressed by the soldiery, and obliged to entertain and feed them without recompense, and get nothing but curses in return, which it must be acknowledged,' said he, again surveying the table, `such fare deserves.' It was not long before things wore a different aspect. The bright and sunny hue of the stranger's mind began to illumine even the dismal room of the alehouse. The landlord spread a much better repast upon the table, and, in honor of Fortunatus, placed a second smoky lamp directly before him. As the light glared upon his youthful and manly countenance, Edward suddenly arose and seized his hand. `Brothers,' said he, `this is the very soldier who saved me from disgrace yesterday, when the dragoon stood over me.' `Ah! is it you, my brave fellow?' exclaimed his protector; `it was your own mettle that saved you, for if you had not shown that honor was dearer than life, you might have been thrashed like a poltroon for all me. But come!' added he, filling the glasses round, and not forgetting the obsequious landlord, `we are all a peg too low!' Glass after glass exhilarated the company, and the eyes of the young Conscripts began to sparkle. `I wish,' said Conrad, as he felt his blood warm, `that I went heart and hand in this cause.' `Poh!' said the new comer, `it is not for us to reason. We have nothing to do but fight. Let us drink Vive l'Empereur! `I cannot,' said Conrad; `my father is a royalist.' `Well, then,' exlaimed the good natured soldier, `let us drink to the girl we love best! Come!' said he to Edward, who had filled his glass, `give us her name.' `My sister Alice,' replied Edward, with animation. A shout of laughter from the soldier abashed the youth. `I don't care for any other girl,' said he, coloring deeply. `It is true,' said Conrad; `he is a mere boy. He has always been brought up with his twin sister Alice. `But come, Philip,' said he, turning with an arch expression to his second brother, `you can help us out.' The blushes of Philip were of a still deeper hue than Edward's. At length, however, in a low voice he said, `Lucile.' The soldier had narrowly observed him. `By my soul,' exclaimed he, `I believe you have all lived upon mother's milk, and just escaped from the nursery.' `I hope,' said Conrad, proudly, `you will see that we do not shrink from our duty tomorrow.' `In the mean time,' said the soldier, `let us all drink a bumper to our sister Alice.' The brothers smiled. There was something in the light hearted, fearless gaiety of the new comer that animated their own spirits. They soon lost the reserve and awkwardness of strangers, and conversed with ease and freedom. The father of the Conscripts, Jean de Castellon, inhabited a cottage that had descended from sire to son on the mother's side. It was one of those luxuriant spots cultured by the breath of heaven. Yet Jean's labor was not spared. All that patient industry requires to give affluence and utility to natural beauty, he had done. His barns opened their vast folding doors to receive the harvest of autumn; his agricultural utensils were of the best kind, and in the finest order, and no traveller passed without remarking on the taste and neatness of his dwelling. The death of Jean's wife was the first calamity he had experienced. He was several years older than she, and had been a husband rather after the patriarchal order than that of modern French gallantry. But though he required great deference, it was willingly paid, and nothing disturbed the harmony of their union. At her death Jean had exercised the paternal care of father and mother in an exemplary manner. His two oldest boys were already able to assist his labors, and Edward and Alice were his constant companions. Years had passed in this tranquil state, and the father daily felt his cares lightened by the aid of his sons. It was at this period that a detachment of soldiers entered the village for Conscripts. Their short stay was marked by plunder, and they bore away in triumph Jean's eldest born, Conrad. The succeeding year Philip was marked out and enlisted as a soldier. Edward still remained, nor did it enter the old man's head that they could rob him of all; but when the decisive battle was to be fought, when the best blood of France was to be spilt like water, and Napoleon gleaned, for the last desperate effort of his ambition, the hope of the nation, then the father was deprived of all. Yet still some form was preserved. No youth under sixteen was to be forced into the service—Edward had passed that age a few days before. The kind hearted villagers exhorted Jean to make use of evasion. They promised to stand by him; but when he was put upon oath, he not only told the day, but the very hour of his son's birth, and the only favor he could obtain, was, that his two boys might fight side by side. Such was the history of the Conscripts, nor was it uncommon. A late historian says, `No distinction was made. The son of the widow, the child of the decrepit and helpless, had no right to claim exemption. Three sons might be carried off in three successive years from the same desolated parents. There was no allowance made for having already supplied a recruit.'[5] [5] Scott's Life of Napoleon. Fortunatus, now the companion of the brothers, was no Conscript. He had voluntarily enlisted in the French army, and he believed their arms invincible. He was full of amusing anecdote, and assured them that he had fought in several battles. `I don't know how it is,' said he, `I don't love to fight in cool blood; but when I heard the sound of the trumpet and the drum, and the music of the cannon, it is a different thing. I have never yet lost life or limb. From my childhood I was called Fortunatus, because I have been remarkable for my good luck; but my real name is Frederic de Lancey.' `I wish,' said Philip, thoughtfully, `I felt as secure as you do, that only one of us would escape tomorrow with life; but when I think of our poor father and sister Alice, my heart dies within me.' `If that is all, my dear boy,' said the soldier, `give yourself no uneasiness. I never knew more than two of a family shot in one battle; and the other may return to comfort his father.' A sudden thought seemed to strike Conrad. `Have you a father?' said he to the soldier. `No,' replied he, the expression of his countenance suddenly changing; `my father died in my arms, and left me without a relative in the world.' `And yet you call yourself Fortunatus?' said Edward. `And why not?' replied he; `was I not happy to have been on the spot when my dear father breathed his last? Oh, it was the most fortunate moment of my life. I have no one now to mourn for me, and if I die tomorrow I shall not draw a tear from a human eye. I am without kindred, a citizen of the world, and may, possibly, as I pass along, administer to the enjoyment of my fellow beings, but I cannot diminish their happiness.' `I am thinking,' said Conrad, `if we three should fall, you might be a son to our father.' `And a brother to Alice,' added Edward. `Most willingly would I,' said the soldier; `but would they receive me? Who will vouch for my character?' `I will,' said Edward, with animation; `you stood my friend because I was oppressed. I had no other claim upon you. I will write an account of the whole affair to my father. He is generous, and will confide in you.' `And I,' said Conrad, `have a commission that will prove you are no imposter. Look,' said he, `it is the picture of my mother. I always wear it next my heart. She was as good as an angel, and I feel as if no evil could come where she is. You shall deliver this to Alice, and tell her I sent it.' `Be it so!' exclaimed De Lancey. `If I survive you, I will seek out your father and offer my services. If I die, I bequeath to the survivors my knapsack and its contents. You will find a hundred Napoleons in it. It is all I am worth, and now let us to bed and sleep till morning.' `Not yet,' said Conrad; `we must do all that is to be done this evening. Good landlord! bring me pen and ink, and you shall be our witness.' He then wrote— 'Dear and Honored Father! `When you receive this letter, your three sons will be no more. Frederic de Lancey is the bearer of it. He has done our dear Edward a signal service, and I have thought him trustworthy to convey to Alice the picture of my mother. My heart bleeds when I think of you, without one prop for your old age, save our innocent and helpless sister. We are all satisfied De Lancey would be a faithful son to you if you will permit him to be. In case of his death tomorrow—and the chances of war are alike to all—he has bequeathed to us all he is worth, and it is the earnest wish of my brothers as well as myself, that if he should be the only survivor, you would adopt him; and if he and sister Alice should fancy each other, that he may become a son in reality. `In case he is the sole survivor, I bequeath him all my part of the inheritance, and my brothers do the same—always in deference to you—entreating you will consider this as our last will and testament. `Witness, `Conrad de Castellon. `Philip de Castellon. `Edward de Castellon. `Jean Pipon, Landlord of the Plucked Hen.' The letter was sealed and directed to the father. Then Conrad, taking the miniature, which was fastened to his neck by a black ribbon, pressed it to his lips, and his brothers did the same. De Lancey was lodged in the room with the Conscripts. In a few moments his breathing denoted that he had sunk into that calm and tranquil sleep that belongs to health of body and mind. Philip and Edward, too, forgot for a while their gloomy presentiments, and slept quietly. But not so Conrad. He felt a responsibleness pressing upon him that he could neither avert nor control. The rain continued to pour in torrents, and the wind shook the miserable dwelling to its foundation. Amid the tumult of the elements, the clattering of horses' hoofs, the shrill notes of the trumpet, and the heavy roll of the drum, might be distinguished. New companies were entering the village, and the shouts of Vive l'Empereur! still resounded in his ear. Conrad gazed upon his sleeping brothers, and his soul melted as he thought of them on the field of battle. The morning dawned upon his unclosed eyes, when, with that weariness, which seems almost like perverseness, nature could resist no longer, and he fell into a slumber. He was awakened by the voice of his brothers, and, starting up, found De Lancey already gone. The brothers gave each other a long and close embrace, and hastened to their ranks. The weather was yet unsettled. A thick mist enveloped the country around, and as the armies approached each other, neither friends nor foes could be distinguished. It was not till late in the morning that the clouds dispersed, and the sun broke forth in all its splendor. The dense and heavy vapors separated, and the clear blue sky was seen in distant perspective. At length even the fleecy clouds rolled away, and all was calm and tranquil in the heavens, forming a striking contrast to the scene below. The two armies were engaged in desperate contest. The once fertile valley and vine covered hills lay blended by the smoke of the cannon, and confused shouts rent the air. How many mothers, widows, and orphans, have wept for that day! How many beheld the `brave and beautiful' go forth to battle! Years have passed away, and memory still asks, `Where are they?' Amidst the tumult of war one scene of private distress was passing. Seated on a little hillock, and supporting his youngest brother's head upon his lap, sat Conrad de Castellon. His pale countenance and knit brow, discovered the agony of his feelings. Nor was it wholly mental. His leg had been shattered by a cannon ball, but it was only of Edward he thought. `Oh! for a drop of water,' he exclaimed, `one draught might save him!' But who would stop in the full career of victory to administer to the wants of one dying man, when thousands lay around? The French army were in the full career of victory. `On, on, to Brussels!' rung on every side. `Is there no human aid?' said Conrad, and he rested his brother's head against a prostrate soldier and strove to rise; but it was impossible, and he fell back with a groan and fainted. He was roused by the voice of De Lancey. `Up, comrade!' said he, `the horse are advancing; you will be trampled under foot.' Conrad pointed to his disabled leg, and the lifeless boy that lay before him. He was, indeed, lifeless. The spirit had passed away, and the stiffness of death had succeeded to the last pressure of his brother's hand. `We can do nothing for him,' said De Lancey; `he is gone. But I may save you,' and, taking the soldier in his arms, he bore him to a place of safety, and laid him on the turf. `My brother! my poor Edward!' exclaimed Conrad, `must he be trampled under foot?' Once more De Lancey rushed back, seized the slight form of the Conscript, and placed it by the side of his brother, then, joining in the shout of `On, to Brussels! Vive l'Empereur! mingled in the battle. It was late at night when the soldier cautiously sought the spot where he had left Conrad. He found him still watching by his brother. VOL. I. 22 `I have secured a place for you in a wagon,' said De Lancey. `You must go to the Hospital of St Catharine. You will be taken good care of.' `I cannot leave him,' said Conrad, still clinging to his brother; `my poor Edward!' `He is better off than we are,' said the soldier, `for he does not live to see the disgrace of our army. All is lost! And well it might be,' continued he, indignantly, `when they forced boys like this from the arms of their mothers;' and he parted the curls of his hair, and the moon shone on his white forehead. `I pledge you my honor,' continued he, `that I will see him buried where vultures cannot reach him. I will convey you to the wagon, and return to this spot again. Tomorrow I will see you at the Hospital, where I hope to find you doing well.' Faithful to his promise, De Lancey joined him in the morning. The surgeon had already passed judgment on the wounded soldier. A violent fever had set in, and amputation of the limb, which would have been his only chance, would now hasten his end—he must die. `Let it be so,' said Conrad, `my father will yet have a staff for his age if Philip lives; if not, remember your promise.' De Lancey staid by his friend till he breathed his last, and then took every means to ascertain whether Philip had survived the battle. His inquiries proved fruitless, but from several circumstances he felt sanguine in the belief that he was not among the slain, and naturally concluded he must have returned to his father. He regretted that he could not have restored the picture to him. `It will cost me a journey, now,' said he, `but I will wait till Philip has been at home a few weeks.' As time weakened his impressions his resolution grew fainter; for, it must be confessed, Fortunatus was not one of those that thought it good to go to `the house of mourning.' He had, from his youth upward, been the subject of perpetual change, and had seen death in too many forms to be startled at it—but the tears of a father and a sister he knew not how to encounter. A cloud had obscured his brow for a few days after this event, but it was soon dissipated, and he again became the happy, light hearted Fortunatus. With the gay and thoughtless, time passes unmarked. It was nearly a year after the battle of Waterloo, when De Lancey was travelling through the little village in which he had been introduced to the Landlord of `The Plucked Hen.' He stopped to pay him a visit, but the host was changed. The room, the table, the seats, all remained the same, and so forcibly called up the recollection of his promise to the brothers, that his conscience smote him for the delay. He went immediately to visit Edward's grave. He had taken the precaution to identify it by two Lombardy poplars, which he had planted opposite, and twisted into an arch over the grave. They were twigs that he had cut from a neighbouring tree, but they had taken root, and were now covered with foliage. The grass had grown over the grave with a luxuriance that made the spot striking from the desolation that still remained around it. By sunrise De Lancey had proceeded many miles on his way to Patière, where Jean de Castellon resided. It would have been a long and weary foot journey for one with less health and muscular strength; but it was his favorite way of travelling, and, he was fully of opinion, much less fatiguing than riding. And then, too, he could stop when he pleased and converse with all the good humored pleasant people he met, and make acquaintances where he thought they were worth making. Nothing, in fact, could be pleasanter than De Lancey's mode of travelling. He was too much accustomed to his knapsack to find it any burden, and he had provident virtue enough to secure himself means for every comfort a foot traveller could desire. His little modicum had increased during the past year, and, though in the thoughtless benevolence of his heart, he sometimes gave a few francs injudiciously, yet he always said, in some way or other, they brought back their full interest. When he entered Patière he inquired for the house of Castellon, and was directed to a whitewashed cottage surrounded by venerable trees. It was in the month of June, and every shrub and flower was in its first fragrance. An old man was sitting on a bench before the door. De Lancey approached him with a respectful air, and, taking off his hat, said, `Monsieur de Castellon?' `The same,' he replied. `I would ask,' said the soldier, hesitatingly, `for Philip.' `And why for Philip?' said the old man, sternly, `why not for Conrad, my eldest born, and Edward, my youngest?' De Lancey made no reply. `Come,' said he, `with me, and I will show you all I know of them.' He arose from his seat and walked slowly to a little wicker gate. He entered it and proceeded by a foot path to a hillock planted with trees. The soldier followed in silence. It was the family burying ground. Three simple gravestones, with the names of the brothers inscribed on each, were placed side by side. De Lancey's question was answered. Philip had never returned from the battle of Waterloo. `I knew,' said he, with emotion, `the fate of Conrad and Edward; but I had hoped Philip had escaped.' `Not one,' said the father, clasping his hands, `not a remnant was left.' `I was a fellow soldier,' said De Lancey. `I was quartered with them the evening before the battle.' `A soldier in Bonaparte's army?' said the old man, extending his hand. `Then you too are a Conscript?' `No,' said De Lancey, `I was no Conscript. I enlisted voluntarily.' The father withdrew his hand and turned coldly away. `I have a commission from your son Conrad,' said De Lancey, `but it is for your daughter, and I must deliver it to her.' As they approached the house Alice met them at the door. The sight of a soldier revived painful recollections, and a cloud came over her bright and blooming countenance. De Lancey started at the strong resemblance she bore to her twin brother. There was the same tranquil expression of sweetness and innocence that had lingered on his face, even after his death. He put his hand into his bosom and withdrew the miniature. `This,' said he, `I promised your brother Conrad to deliver to you if I was the survivor.' Alice took it, gazed upon it for a moment, and rushed into the house. The Father, with an air of authority, desired De Lancey to come in. The soldier proceeded to inform him of all the circumstances which related to the deaths of his two sons. `Of Philip,' said he, `I know nothing. When I last saw him he had received no injury, but was in the heat of battle, and fighting with a bravery worthy of Napoleon himself.' `No more of that,' said the old man, with bitterness. `You say,' continued he, `Conrad died in your arms.' 22* `He did,' replied the soldier, `and he had every comfort, and the best of medical advice; and as for attendance, it would not be becoming for me to say much about that, but I never left him, night nor day, as long as he lived. I could not have done more for him had it have been the Emperor himself.' The last words were uttered in a low voice, and seemed to have escaped him without his consent. The father, however, did not remark them. `I hope,' said he `my son died like a good Protestant.' `I don't know anything about that,' replied De Lancey, `but I am sure he died like a Christian.' `This is a Popish country,' said the old man; `I hope he had no father confessors about his bed.' `Not one—not a limb of them,' said the soldier. De Castellon was a Swiss, and entertained a horror of the Roman Catholic religion. `You say,' said he, `that my poor Conrad died like a Christian. Then he confessed his sins to his Maker, and died in the fear of God.' `I don't know,' said De Lancey, `what he might confess, for that was an affair between his Maker and himself; but as to fear, I saw nothing that looked like it, for when he was dying he said, “I did not expect to meet my dear Edward so soon, but I am going home, after all.”' `You must stay with us a few days,' said the old man, his heart melting of the thoughts of his sons. `Most willingly,' said De Lancey, `if you will give me some employment. I do not love idleness, and about a place like this, a pair of hands can't come amiss.' It was amusing to see with what facility the soldier adopted the habits and employments of the farmer. His services grew every day more and more important to De Castellon. A treaty of amity seemed to be formed between them, and Bonaparte was never alluded to on either side. A sentiment of delicacy had prevented De Lancey from delivering the letter of the brothers, for he knew the contents, and that they related wholly to himself. The intercourse between Alice and the soldier was friendly and confiding. He learned from her how he could best assist her father in his labors, and how he could be most useful to herself; and they soon ceased to regard each other as strangers. His present mode of life was to the soldier like a new existence. To exchange the noise and bustle of a camp for the serenity and stillness of the country; to feel his time and his mind occupied without the feverish excitement of contest, was alone delightful. But when, added to this, he felt for the first time the power of woman, her innocent and affectionate smile, the sanctity of her virtue, her habitual sacrifices in the arrangements of domestic life, and her habits of temperance, of order, and of purity, he shrunk from the recollection of past scenes. This feeling he expressed to Alice, whom he sportively called his pet lamb, with his usual frankness. `What a forlorn creature,' said he, `have I hitherto been! I have had nothing to love or to watch over—I can but just remember my mother—and yet, when my head has been throbbing with pain, I have sometimes wished I could lay it in her lap as I used to when I was a child. But this was only the thought of a moment, and I banished it as unmanly, for I only considered myself ennobled by the ferociousness with which I fought for my country.' `Well,' said Alice, smiling, `I suppose you would fight again if you could find a leader.' `No,' he replied, `not if I can find employment any other way. My views are changed. I have a thousand associations which are new to me. I think I am going back to childhood again. The flowers have the same fragrance that they used to have when I was a boy, and the world seems to me to be just created. I desire no greater happiness than to live with you and your father as I do now, and you have only to say the word, and I will turn my sword into a pruning knife.' It was by such language, uttered almost without thought, that the young couple began to promise endless faith to each other. `But I am afraid,' said Alice, after an impassioned burst of feeling from her lover, `that my father will never consent to our being married.' `And why not?' said the sanguine Fortunatus. `Where can he find a more devoted son-in-law—one that will do a harder day's work or raise a finer crop of wheat? Besides, Alice,' said he, smiling affectionately, `you have been bequeathed to me. I never would have told you about the thing if you had not voluntarily given me your heart, but now you shall know the whole.' It was the first time he had alluded to the letter. Alice listened to the explanation, without participating in his sanguine expectations. She knew her father was tenacious of his projects, and that he favored the suit of her cousin Pierre. With the confidence of a warm and generous heart, De Lancey repaired to De Castellon with the sealed letter in his hand. He took it and read it through, then turned a steady eye on the soldier. `Why have you not delivered it before?' said he. `My motives,' replied De Lancey, `may not have justified this delay; but I knew the contents of the letter, and I knew, also, that I had no right to expect from you the same confidence in a stranger that your sons had felt.' `And what has now altered the case?' said the father. The soldier blushed deeply; `I don't know why I should hesitate to speak,' said he. `It is the confidence your daughter has placed in me. She has permitted me to ask your consent to our union. I have something to begin the world with. I have health and activity. I will serve you with the fidelity and affection of a son, and if, as it may be in the common course of nature, Alice should be left alone with me, I will shield her from every evil.' The eagerness with which he spoke had prevented his attending to the emotions that were struggling in the old man's countenance. At length he exclaimed, `I see it all. I am no longer a dupe. My poor boys were victims to this fatal legacy. Out of my sight! Away, wretch!' `What does all this mean?' exclaimed the soldier, with astonishment. `Ask your own vile heart!' replied De Castellon. `It seemed to me beyond the usual chances of war that three sons should fall in one battle. But you could tell us how it was; you could describe their last agonies, and have now come to reap the reward of your treachery!' De Lancey for a moment stood petrified. It was but a moment. `Old man,' said he, `were you my equal in age, or were you any other than you are—but I do wrong to reply. Farewell! we meet no more.' Alice had repaired to a little arbor that her lover had reared for her, and that was already covered with the quick springing vines of a luxuriant climate, to await the success of his communication. Many a foreboding doubt assailed her mind when she cast her eye upon his agitated countenance. `I come,' said he, `to take leave of you forever.' It was in vain that Alice intreated him to delay his departure from the village. `My father may relent,' said she. But he was resolute. `Had it been common reluctance,' he replied, `I would have borne with it. I would have crouched like a slave for your sake; but to be suspected of the basest of crimes! Alice, I wish not to shock you by repeating what has passed. If your father tells you, I shall be justified in your opinion. Farewell! dearest and best; henceforth this world is a wilderness to me. I care not which way I steer my course. With anguish I speak it—we can meet no more.' Bitter, indeed, was the parting. For the first time the hitherto happy Fortunatus felt the true pang of sorrow. The tenderness of friendship had refined and softened his heart, and given it an unwonted susceptibility. Till now he had met the evils of life with an unsubdued spirit. He had faced danger and death in every form; but the tears that he drew from Alice, and the affection he had awakened in her bosom, were spells that changed the life current of his heart. With slow and lingering steps he quitted the village, wholly unlike the being that had entered it three months before, and inquired for the house of De Castellon. Where was now his new born enthusiasm for every object in nature? With a listless step he trod on the sweet scented wildflowers as if they were the dry and worthless leaves of autumn. He realized, as many have done before, that it is the light of the mind that throws over nature her verdant and prismatic hues; that gives to the music of the birds its sound of gladness; to the lofty cataract its thunder of eloquence, and to the murmuring waterfall its sweet, low notes of sympathy. It was not, however, in the constitution of the soldier to cherish melancholy. When he first quitted the village, with his heart swelling with anguish, and his head throbbing with indignation, he felt as if all ties were broken with the human race; but, as he walked slowly on, his pulse beat more temperately. By degrees he answered with something like gaiety to the greeting of the peasants, who accosted him as he passed. The feeling of mortification, which the horrible suspicions of De Castellon had engendered, began to dissipate. `He is an old man,' said he, `blasted and withered by the breath of heaven; I will think of him no more. But Alice! may I perish if I forget thee!' For his future lot he had no anxiety. With his sword he knew he could carve out a living, but the same sentiment came over him that had operated with so many of Napoleon's soldiers—`Wherefore should we fight? We have no Emperor to fight for!' and he resolved to quit France and seek his fortune elsewhere. There is an energy, a feeling of resource, of mental power, that is invincible. He who is born with the determination to succeed, will realize that `nothing is impossible.' Love, with men, is a recreation and a passion. With women, it becomes a part of their existence. Let not her, who has once given herself up to its reveries, hope to break the spell that is wound around her. Sickness, poverty, and age, may, to the eyes of others, render the object worthless; but the sensibility of woman possesses an alchemy that turns all to gold. It is in vain for friends to reason, for the world to scoff—her destiny is to love on. Years had passed away. The head of the old De Castellon was white with time. The youthful and girlish figure of Alice had assumed the serious and maidenly deportment of maturer life. Yet any one might have seen that the rose on her cheek had withered before its time. A paleness had settled there, but it was the complexion of sentiment and thought; there was nothing of the sickly hue of melancholy. Her cousin Pierre had many times renewed his suit, and at last had consoled himself with a less cruel fair one. All Alice had asked of her father was to take care of him, to be the comfort of his old age, and when that was past to lay down beside her mother's grave, and have strewed on her own, as was the custom of the village, a few emblematic flowers as a token that the lowly tenant had died in `single blessedness.' The internal arrangements of the cottage retained all their comfort and neatness; for though Alice had lost some of the superfluous activity of youth, enough remained for all the useful purposes of life; but the external appearance had gradually changed. The hedges were untrimmed, and implements of agriculture lay unsheltered on the greensward before the door. The hills and pastures were no longer crowned with luxuriance. All looked as if the master's hand was wanting. It was a cold evening in November that Alice and her father were seated by the fire. There was an air of comfort in the little apartment that female ingenuity knows well how to give. The floor was covered with a carpet of her own manufacture; and her father's arm chair had been stuffed and rendered commodious by her own contrivance. There was the debility of age and sickness in his appearance, and a crutch lay beside him. Alice read aloud or worked, alternately, as best suited her father. She had just taken her book when the sound of wheels stopping at the door arrested their attention. A man hastily entered, and stood for a moment gazing at the inhabitants;—then rushing forward, he knelt before the old man, exclaiming, `My father! my father!' De Castellon was bewildered, but not so Alice. `It is my brother!' she exclaimed, and hung upon his neck. When the father began to comprehend the scene, that it was, indeed, Philip restored to him, he inquired for Conrad and Edward. The countenance of Philip changed, and he said, `I only am left to tell you.' In the same expressive language the father replied, `Now then, let me die, since I have seen the face of my son!' Providence has wisely decreed that the sensibilities of life should be blunted by age, and the effervescence of feeling pass away. The old man became calm, and at his usual hour desired Alice to read a chapter in the Bible. Amid tears and sobs she read aloud, but every word called forth the bursting emotions of her heart, and her soul was kindled by living fire from the altar. When she ceased, a low, fervent prayer from the lips of the father followed, and then Alice performed her usual office of putting him to bed, and was again at liberty to throw herself into the arms of her brother. Their conversation was long and deeply interesting. He told her that after the battle of Waterloo he was conveyed among the wounded to a small farm house, and found that his life was considered worth preserving by the English, among whom he now was; that when sufficiently recovered he was put on board a small vessel bound for the West Indies; that they were taken by Spanish pirates, and himself with three others put on shore on the coast of South America; that he had earned by daily labor a pittance that kept him from starving, but he had still to contend with weakness and depression. `But now,' continued he, `Alice, comes the best VOL. I. 23 part of my story. I was one day working on the wharf, when a vessel arrived and a young man sprung on shore that I immediately recognized as a fellow soldier at the battle of Waterloo.' He stopped and looked earnestly at her; the blood rushed to her cheeks. `Yes, sister,' said he, fully comprehending her emotion, `it was our friend Fortunatus. I learnt from him all that had passed. From this moment I felt new energy; my whole nature was changed. He loaded me with kindness. You know his happy faculty of making friends. Several of the officers, who had quitted France and repaired to this country, recognised the brave and warm hearted soldier. Fortune showered her gifts upon him, and at the end of three years after our first meeting we have returned once more; I, with little more than I carried with me; but my companion rich enough to purchase our whole estate, which, as it proved, we unfortunately bequeathed to him.' `Then he is in France?' said Alice, faintly. `He is,' replied Philip, `and he loves you as well as I can see you do him; but he will not come here. He cannot forgive my father for his horrible suspicion.' `Then he does not love as I do,' said Alice, ingenuously, `or all would be forgiven.' `No, Alice,' replied Philip, `men never love as women do. They have various motives which operate; but next to his country and his honor, a man may love his mistress.' `I am afraid you have forgotten poor Lucile,' said Alice, reproachfully. `Perhaps she has forgotten me,' replied Philip. `Oh! no,' said Alice, `it was but the other day she came up here and sat down by your grave stone, and wept bitterly, and said she never should forget you.' `Well,' replied Philip, `I have returned the visit, for I called to see her on my way here, and informed her that I was alive and well.' `I see,' said Alice, smiling, `you were right. A man may love his mistress next to his country, and his honor before father or sister. But tell me, my dear brother, how could you remain so long in a strange country, away from us, and not send us word you were living.' `As to remaining there,' said Philip, `there was not much choice in the business. I was taken up on suspicion, and had to work with a chain round my leg; and what good would it have done you to know the miserable condition of your brother? After the arrival of De Lancey, his plan was best, that we should return together as soon as he had accomplished the object of his voyage.' It was not difficult for the young people to persuade the father, humbled as he was by years, infirmities, and sorrows, how much he had mistaken the character of the soldier. An acknowledgement was all that De Lancey asked, and it was no sooner sent than he hastened to the spot. There is little more to add. He purchased a neat cottage about half a mile from the family mansion. It was arranged with simplicity and good taste. The same marriage ceremony united Lucile and Philip, and De Lancey and Alice; but their residence was changed. Alice resigned her station to Lucile, and removed to the home her husband had prepared for her. The two cottages may yet be seen embowered in honeysuckle and grape vines. Before the doors are often sporting rosy faced children, and Alice has given to her two eldest boys, Conrad and Edward, the names of her Conscript Brothers. SACHEM'S HILL. [This is a very small hill, on the sea shore, in the town of Quincy. It is shaped like an Indian arrow head, as its original name, Masentusett, in their language indicates; Mas, meaning arrow head, and entusett, hill. From this spot, Boston and its vicinity, from the Blue Hills to the rocks of Nahant, rise upon the view like a panorama. It was the abode of the principal Sachem when the English first arrived here. He was a friendly old man, and sold them corn and land. Soon after their arrival an epidemic appeared among the Indians, and in a short time nothing was left of them but the few remains that are still found of their simple implements of war and agriculture, and the name of this hill, that was given, with a slight alteration, to our state.] Here, from this little hillock in days long since gone by, Glanced over hill and valley the Sachem's eagle eye; His were the pathless forests, and his the hills so blue, And on the restless ocean glanced only his canoe. Here stood the aged chieftain, rejoicing in his glory— How deep the shade of sadness that rests upon his story! For the white man came with power, and like brethren they met, But the Indian fires went out, and the Indian sun has set. And the chieftain has departed; gone is his hunting ground; And the twanging of his bowstring is a forgotten sound. Where dwelleth yesterday? and where is echo's cell? Where has the rainbow vanished?—There does the Indian dwell. But in the land of spirits the Indian has a place, And there, 'midst saints and angels, he sees his Maker's face; There from all earthly passions his heart may be refined, And the mists that once enshrouded be lifted from his mind. And should his free born spirit descend again to earth, And here, unseen, revisit the spot that gave him birth, Would not his altered nature rejoice with rapture high, At the changed and glorious prospect that now would meet his eye? Where nodded pathless forests, there, now, are stately domes, Where hungry wolves were prowling, are quiet, happy homes; Where rose the savage war whoop is heard sweet village bells, And many a gleaming spire, of faith in Jesus tells. And he feels his soul is changed—'t is there a vision glows Of more surpassing beauty than earthly scenes disclose; For the heart that felt revenge with boundless love is filled, And the tide of restless passion to a holy calm is stilled. Here to my mental vision the Indian chief appears, And all my eager questions fancy believes he hears. Oh speak! thou unseen being, and the mighty secrets tell Of the land of deathless glories, where the departed dwell. I cannot dread a spirit—for I would gladly see The veil uplifted round us, and know that such things be. The things we see are fleeting, like summer flowers decay— `The things unseen are real,' and do not pass away. The friends we love so dearly smile on us and are gone, And all is silent in their place, and we are left alone; But the joy `that passeth show,' the love no arm can sever, And all the treasures of their souls shall be with us forever! 23* THE FRONTIER HOUSE. BY THE AUTHOR OF `NORTHWOOD.' `I shall return before dark,' said Edward Abbot to his young wife, as he kissed their boy, and laid it in her arms. `There is no danger, Rebecca.' `But my dream of those frightful savages, Edward,' said she. `Oh! that should not frighten you,' he replied. `Remember you had been hearing Indian stories all the evening, and the wise man says, “a dream cometh through the multitude of business,” which our good Mr Walker explains as meaning whatever most engrosses our thoughts, particularly just before we fall asleep. There have not been any traces of the savages discovered this season, and I should be sorry to raise an alarm in the town merely on account of a dream.' `But you know, Edward, they are a secret, as well as terrible enemy,' said Mrs Abbot, and raised her mild eyes to her husband's face with that pleading expression, when tears seem ready to start, and yet are checked by the fear of giving pain to the one the heart loves, that a fond husband finds it so difficult to withstand. `I will not go to the garrison to day,' said he, laying down his hat. `But you promised your father, and he expects you on important business,' said Mrs Abbot. `You must go. I know my fears are childish, but they shall not make me wicked. I am too apt to think my security depends entirely on your presence. I forget the One mighty to save can defend me, and that trust in Him is a shield to the Christian. You had better go.' `Not without you,' said her husband, who now began to feel the fears she was endeavouring to shake off. `Come, prepare our little Edward and we will go down together. If there has been any alarm we will not return to night.' Rebecca paused a few moments, as if considering her husband's proposition. The subtilties of the ancient schoolmen are not so perplexing, so difficult of explanation, so contradictory, as are often the feelings and wishes of the human heart. Scarce five minutes had elapsed since Rebecca would have thought permission to accompany her husband would have obviated every inconvenience, and been attended with no danger. But other considerations now arose. Edward had been summoned to attend a public meeting on affairs of the town. Should she go with him it might excite notice, for the ladies of those days seldom visited, and should inquiries be made she could hardly satisfy them without alluding to her fears, and then her dream must be told to justify her fears, and there was no telling where or when the excitement would stop. And moreover her husband might incur reproof from the elders for listening to his wife's fears and dreams, and thus raising agitations among the people. All these things might occur because the wife of Edward Abbot could not stay alone one afternoon. `I will have more fortitude, Edward,' said Rebecca, smiling. `I will not make a fool of you, though I appear like one myself. I will not go. It is nearly a mile, and you have no time to spare to carry the babe, or wait for me, and I ought not to go—so do not let me hinder you another moment.' It was in vain Edward urged her to accompany him. The more she saw his generous anxiety on her account, the more she labored to suppress her fears, till finally she persuaded him, and herself too, that she felt no uneasiness at all from the prospect of passing three hours alone, and Edward departed. How much interest is given to the ruins of a temple, castle, or fortification, by having a story of suffering, a legend of love or tale of heroism connected with the memory of the crumbling fabrics! Even a rugged mountain or narrow lake, if associated with the history of human feelings and passions, becomes more attractive to the cultivated mind than the resorts of fashion. But of this romantic kind of interest the wild and beautiful places of our own land are nearly destitute. Improvement does not pause in its career to preserve a relic of the olden times, and industry labors to convert everything into a source of immediate profit. This course of proceeding is doubtless most convenient, but it may be questioned whether it be the most patriotic. The love of country is a species of pride, compounded of lofty and sacred recollections of the worth and achievements of our ancestors, and that vanity which is fostered by knowing the importance which other nations attach to our history and traditions. Probably Scott's `Lady of the Lake' imparts more national pride to a Scotsman than he would feel in contemplating a rail road from Edinburgh to London. This pride, created by the productions of genius, is perfectly compatible with our republican habits and institutions. Indeed, nothing would more contribute to deepen, to perpetuate the love of liberty and our country, than well told legends of our ancestors. Their piety, ardor, sufferings, constancy, and courage, and ultimate success would form themes lofty, tender, or romantic, and yet differing materially in character from the adventures of European romance. Our fictions, if well narrated, would now excite more intense interest than the feats of knights or the fortunes of princes, because the deeds of American daring were performed by men either to defend or perpetuate principles, rights, and possessions, which the enlightened and liberal of every country feel to be most interesting and important, and compared with which, the wild deeds of chivalry and the exploits of the crusaders appear disgusting or preposterous, criminal or trivial. This little sketch, however, does not pretend to be even a sample of what may be wished, and, indeed, expected from the gifted spirits of our land. It is only the record of conjugal and maternal love, the same in all ages and in every nation. The house of Edward Abbot stood on the western bank of the Merrimack, nearly a mile from the present village of Concord, then called Rumford. Edward was the first who had ventured to reside at such a distance from the garrisons or fortified houses, and he had thus obtained the reputation of remarkable courage, of which he was quite as proud as a dashing blade of these polished days would be in accepting a challenge to a duel. His wife, too, participated in his triumph, and the wish to spare him mortification was a powerful motive to inspire her with resolution to overcome her own fears and allow him to depart, when, from the presentiment she felt that danger was nigh, she would, by the superstition of the times, have been justified in detaining, or at least, accompanying him. But she saw him depart without tears, watched him from the small window till he entered the forest, and then betook herself to her household concerns. Yet she could not forbear going frequently to the door, and sometimes she would go forth and gaze all around their little domain, and then watch the progress of the sun, with an expression of countenance that, to an observer, would instantly have revealed the agitation and anxiety her heart was suffering. Everything abroad was in perfect quietness. There was scarce a breath of air perceptible, and the waters of the Merrimack flowed without a ripple. The calm July sky looked a deeper and more heavenly blue, seen as it was by Rebecca from a spot circumscribed by tall trees, now clothed with such a fulness of foliage as made the forest look dark and almost impenetrable. Close around the house were planted corn and vegetables, and a field of wheat, in front of the dwelling, stretched in unbroken green to the river's brink. There was not a sound to be heard save the chirping of a robin, that had built her nest on a chestnut which stood close to the southeast corner of the house, the only tree suffered to grow within the inclosure of Edward. The young birds were fully fledged, and, under the guidance of the parents, were about quitting their nest. Rebecca watched their movements, the old birds now encouraging, now seeming to chide their timid offspring, till finally they reached the woods and all disappeared. Slight as the circumstance was, it touched Rebecca with a sense of her loneliness. `Even the birds have left me,' said she to herself, and pressing her boy closer to her bosom, she burst into tears. Rebecca might well be excused these tears and feelings, for though a wife and mother, she was hardly seventeen. And then Rebecca possessed an advantage that, in the eyes of young gentlemen, cancels all feminine weaknesses—she was very beautiful. A lady now displaying similar charms would, for her face, be entitled to the epithets of divine, angelic, Grecian, Madonna, while the gracefulness of her figure would be well understood by all, travelled or untravelled, if just compared with the Venus de Medicis. But the primitive language of our excellent ancestors conveyed the idea of beauty without all this waste of words. They simply and briefly called Rebecca `an exceeding comely young woman.' Yet Rebecca felt no pride on this account, nor ever dreamed of gaining the admiration of any one except her husband. There was then but little of what we call social intercourse, meaning balls, parties, &amp;c. among the people, but there was deep, and fervent, and faithful domestic affection. The former has greatly improved since the period of which I am writing, but, if we credit the bard, and believe that `Corruption shakes, when Peril could not part `The Love, whose deadliest foe is human art!' we must not imagine every advantage is reserved for our own times. Rebecca watched the sun till it had sunk behind the western hills, and then she watched its beams on the clouds till the last faint tints had departed, and, fixing her eyes steadfastly on that part of the forest from which she expected to see her husband emerge, she sat at the door, with her child in her arms, watching in vain for his appearance. The room into which she occasionally glanced, looked so gloomy and desolate she could not endure to enter it. Indeed, as the evening waxed later, and her fears increased, she sometimes imagined she saw strange figures, and faces with gleaming eyes, such as she had beheld in her dream, moving around the dusky apartment. Ashamed of these fears, and knowing her husband, when he came, would chide her for thus exposing herself and her child to the evening dews, she breathed a prayer to Him who stilled the tempest, and entered the house. Her first care, after placing her infant in his cradle, was to light a candle, and then, more reassured, she took her Bible. The Bible was the talisman of our ancestors. It guarded them from evil, and guided them to good. Its pages were a direction in every difficulty, and its promises a resource in every trial. Rebecca read, and prayed alternately, mingling the idea of Edward, his safety, and return with every thought and wish, but still he came not. She had no means of ascertaining the lapse of time, except by the length of candle consumed or the stars, as there was no moon; but she conjectured it must be past midnight. Again and again she went forth and examined with searching glance around, but nothing could she see except the dark forest, in the distance, and, close around her dwelling, the black stumps that stood like sentinels on guard, while nothing was heard save the soft murmur of the water, and at times, a low rustling as the breeze stirred the leaves of the chestnut tree. At length, as she stood at the corner of her house, beneath the shade of that tree, looking earnestly towards the woods, she thought she perceived something emerge from their shadow. If she did, it vanished instantly. She kept her eyes fixed on the spot. A bright starlight enabled her to discern objects quite distinctly, even at a distance, especially when her faculties were roused and stimulated both by hope and fear. After some time she again, and plainly, saw a human figure. It rose from the ground, looked and pointed towards her house, and then again disappeared. She recollected her light. It could be seen from the window, and probably had attracted the notice of the savages, whom, she could no longer doubt, were approaching. They had, as she fancied, waylaid and murdered her husband. They were coming to capture, perhaps murder, her and her child. What should she do? She never thought of attempting to escape without her babe; but in what direction should she fly, when, perhaps, the Indians surrounded the house? There was one moment of terrible agony, when the mangled form of her husband seemed before her, and she heard, in idea, the shrieks of her babe beneath savage tortures, till her breath failed, and reason seemed deserting her. But she made a strong effort to recall her wandering senses, and then, with her eyes and clasped hands raised to heaven, she took her resolution. With a noiseless step she entered her dwelling, extinguished the light, took her infant in her arms, and again stole softly forth, creeping along in the shadow of the house till she reached the spot from whence she had first seen the object that alarmed her. Here she stood perfectly still. Her infant lay on her bosom in profound sleep, as quiet and seemingly as breathless as though his spirit had already departed. She did not wait long before the same figure again rose, looked around, and then sank down as before. The moment it disappeared Rebecca passed swift and softly as a shadow over the space that separated the house from the chestnut tree. This tree was an uncommonly large one, and there was a separation of the trunk into two branches, about three feet from the ground, where Rebecca thought it possible she might be concealed. She gained it, and placed herself in a position which allowed her to watch the door of her dwelling. All was silent for a long time—more than an hour, as she thought, and she began to doubt the reality of what she had seen, imagining she had been deceived and taken a stump for a human figure, and she was about to descend from the tree, where her situation was extremely uncomfortable, when suddenly a savage crept by her between the house and tree. As another and another followed, it was with difficulty she suppressed her screams. But she did suppress them, and the only sign she gave of fear was to press her infant closer to VOL. I. 24 her bosom. They reached the door and a sound of surprise at finding it open, was uttered by the first savage, and replied to by the second, in the Indian language. After a short consultation they entered, and Rebecca soon saw a light gleam, and supposed they had kindled it to search for her. Her pulse beat wildly; yet still she hoped to escape. It was not probable that they would search a tree so near the house; they would rather suppose she had fled to a distance. Presently a crackling noise was heard in the house, the light flashed from the door and window, the Indians raised their wild yell as they rushed out, and danced around with frantic gestures, and Rebecca saw that the house was on fire. Still, the only sign she gave of fear was, as she unloosed the handkerchief from her neck and threw it over her child's face to screen his eyes from the glare of light that might awaken him, to press him closer and closer to her heart. The house was unfinished; there was no plastering to delay, for a moment, the progress of the fire, which had been kindled in the centre of the apartment, and fed by all the combustibles the savages could find in the dwelling. The flame streamed upwards, and soon caught the rafters and boards, and it seemed scarce five minutes from the time Rebecca first saw the light till the blaze burst through the roof. The atmosphere, rarified by the heat around the burning building, suddenly expanded, and the colder and more dense air rushing in, it seemed as if the wind had violently arisen, and it drove the thick smoke, and showered the burning cinders directly on the chestnut tree. Rebecca felt the scorching heat, while the suffocating vapor almost deprived her of the power of respiration. She grew dizzy, yet, still, the only movement she made was to turn her child a little in her arms that he might be more effectually shielded from the smoke and cinders. At that moment one of the savages approached, in the wild movements of his war dance, close to the tree. An eddy of wind swept away the smoke; the light fell full on the pale face of Rebecca; her eyes, as if by the power of fascination, were rivetted on the Indian; his fiery glance was raised towards her, and their gaze met. The savage gave a start, and the note of his war song was shriller as he intently regarded his victim. Suddenly he turned away. Rebecca murmured a prayer and resigned herself to death as she heard them all send forth a prolonged whoop. `My boy! my husband! we shall meet, we shall all meet in heaven!' she cried. But why did not the savages approach? She listened, looked around; the whole clearing was illuminated by the bright glare, and she saw the three Indians flying, with the speed of frighted deer, to the covert of the wood. She did not pause to consider what had caused their flight; but obeying that instinct which bids us shun the present danger, she sprang from the tree and rushed towards the river. She recollected a spot where the bank projected, beneath which, during the summer months, the bed of the river was nearly dry; there she should, at least, be secure from the fire. And there she sheltered herself. Her feet were immersed in water, and she stood in a stooping posture to screen herself from observation should the savages return to seek her. But her infant slumbered peacefully. None of her fears or dangers disturbed his repose, and when the morning light allowed her to gaze on his sweet face, tears of joy and thankfulness flowed fast down her cheeks, that she had been enabled thus to shield that dear, innocent one from the savages and the flames. Soon after sunrise she heard sounds as of people approaching, and soon recognised the voices of her friends from the garrison. Rebecca and her child were conveyed to the village, which her husband, she found, had left about sunset on the preceding evening. Nothing was known, or could be discovered of his fate; the inhabitants had been alarmed by the light from the burning building, and as soon as the morning was sufficiently advanced to allow them to penetrate the forest, they hastened to discover the cause of the fire. Grief for the loss of her husband, combined with the terrors she had suffered, threw Rebecca into a violent fever, and her life was despaired of; but just as the disorder seemed approaching a fatal termination, Edward Abbot arrived at Rumford. He was surprised, while walking homeward, by four Indians, one of whom seized his rifle, while another struck him such a blow on the head with his tomahawk, as totally to deprive him, for several hours, of all recollection. When he did recover he found himself lying at the foot of a tree, his hands bound and an Indian guarding him. All efforts to escape he found would be in vain, and he silently submitted to his fate. About day the three savages joined the one who guarded him, and, conversing hastily a few moments, they began a hurried march. Edward perceived one of the Indians examining him often and attentively. At length, on the fourth day, as the savage was alone with the prisoner, he, by signs, questioned Edward concerning the house where he used to reside. Edward made, on the white birch with a coal taken from their fire, a drawing of his little plantation and house, including, of course, the chestnut tree. The Indian surveyed it in silence, and Edward thought no more of the matter. Early the next morning Edward was awakened by the same Indian, who motioned him to rise, and follow him. The rest of the party were not in sight. Edward obeyed, and followed him two days, travelling rapidly, till suddenly he found himself on the borders of the Merrimack. The Indian then pointed in the direction of Concord, and instantly disappeared in the woods. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add that Edward's presence operated much more favorably on Rebecca than had all the remedies prescribed by the good Doctor Carter, and she soon recovered. The conduct of the Indian excited great curiosity, and made much talk in the village, but, for a long time, the mystery baffled all conjecture. After many months an Indian who could speak English, explained the secret. It seemed that several years before Rebecca was married, an Indian, with his wife and child, came into the house of her father, and asked for food. The old people were absent, and a hired man, acting as many do when `clothed in a little brief authority,' ordered them from the house. Rebecca, then a playful, laughing girl, interposed and prevented them from being thus inhospitably treated. She brought forth the best food the house afforded, and took the Indian babe in her arms and fed it; and to that act of charity, so gracefully performed, she was indebted for her own, and her child's life, and her husband's liberty. 24* THE DEVIL'S LEAP. There is a pleasant village, not far from the capital of New England, where the principles and feelings of our Puritan forefathers were planted too early, and rooted too deeply, to change with every shifting mode of popular fashion. It was among the first hamlets settled in the whole country. Attracted by the rich bottoms of land indented by the sea, and intersected by streams meandering through hill and dale, the quick-sighted pilgrims of the Massachusetts, began a settlement there in the very oldest Colony times. The number of its inhabitants rapidly increased, and speedily came to constitute one of our leading churches, the pillars of our spiritual Israel. Actuated by the ardent sense of religious devotion, which pervaded the conduct of our ancestors, and which, if it sometimes led to unseemly excesses of zeal, was yet in the main a noble and most efficient spring of high minded action, they did not fail to strain their utmost means in the construction of suitable places for the worship of the Almighty, according to the unadulterated simplicity of primitive christian faith. It has not always happened in our country towns that the selection of a site for a church, or a meetinghouse as the Puritans rather affectedly phrased it, has done much credit to the taste of its founders. Fortunately, in the village to which my story relates, a situation was chosen for their church, that was eminently picturesque and commanding. It stood upon the brow of an undulating hill, a few miles from the sea coast, and near to a small river, which flowed in a winding course to the ocean. Placing himself upon this elevated ground, in front of the principal entrance of the church, the spectator might look to the right hand over a large plain, covered, then, with forest trees, and terminating in a wide amphitheatre of distant hills. Before him he could see the river now floating gently onward upon a smooth bed, now brawling across the rugged projections of rock, which broke the stream into waterfalls, or caused it to foam and dash along in rushing rapids and turbulent eddies. Further off, on the left, an extensive range of verdant pastures and well watered meadows might be discerned, sprinkled over with here and there a humble farm house and fields of yellow waving corn, until the remote ocean bounded the grateful prospect, which seemed to melt into the horizon. Although surrounded by rich and well cultivated lands, the spot itself on which the church stood, as frequently occurs in every part of New England, presented a surface of solid rock, not jagged, nor split into cliffs, nor scattered about in huge fragments, but extending in a compact mass just along the level of the ground, seeming as if the ribs of the earth were peeping out from under a too scanty covering of soil. In the neighbourhood of this romantic scene, tradition preserves the account of a singular incident, of which, marvellous as it is, and strange as it may therefore appear to us doubting moderns, there still continues a lasting monument upon the spot. The legend has it, that, at a certain period in the olden times of the Colony, no matter in what precise year, a clergyman of the good old New England stock was pastor of the little community who worshipped in the church above described. He was devout, pious, zealous, and throughly imbued with the spirit of religious endurance and courage, which sustained the men of that age through extremities of suffering, before which feebler spirits would have blenched and sunk. So exalted was his reputation for piety, that, if his people might be credited, the devil himself had been worsted in more than one fierce and desperate encounter with the reverend pastor. Whether the evil spirit was returning from the nightly orgies of some dark crew of witches not far off, or what other object he had been pursuing, I know not; but it so befell that upon a certain occasion this church lay in his path. As he approached, designing to pass near it, or through it, perhaps, by some satanic art, the voice of his dreaded foe, who was dispensing the words of grace from the pulpit, struck upon his ear, just as he ascended the little eminence upon which it stood. Enraged at the sound, he leaped over the church at one furious bound, uttering a yell of spite, which filled the assembled congregation with astonishment and horror. Reader, be not incredulous of the fact; for if you should ever chance to journey through the town of I—, you will have ocular demonstration of its truth. The church still lifts its venerable steeple over the selfsame hill. The river flows tranquilly by, as before, except that persevering industry has fixed flourishing manufactories upon its little waterfalls. The same agreeable rural scenery is visible all around, with the addition of many an improvement placed there by wealth and refinement. And upon the broad, flat surface of the rock in front of the church, where the Enemy of Man halted to take his tremendous leap, the print of his footstep remains plainly discernible, stamped upon the hard exterior by no human power, affording indubitable evidence of the veracity of the tradition. THE TABLE OF EMERALD. Deep, it is said, under yonder Pyramid, has for ages lain concealed the Table of Emerald, on which the Thrice-great Hermes engraved, before the flood, the secret of Alchemy that gives gold at will. Epicurean. That `Emerald Green of the Pyramid'— Were I where it is laid, I'd ask no king for his heavy crown, As its hidden words were said. The pomp and the glitter of worldly pride Should fetter my moments not, And the natural thought of an open mind, Should govern alone my lot. Would I feast all day? revel all night? Laugh with a weary heart? Would I sleep away the breezy morn? And wake till the stars depart? Would I gain no knowledge, and search no deep For the wisdom that sages knew? Would I run to waste with a human mind To its noble trust untrue? Oh! knew I the depth of that `Emerald Green,' And knew I the spell of gold, I would never poison a fresh young heart With the taint of customs old. I would bind no wreath to my forehead free, In whose shadow a thought would die, Nor drink, from the cup of revelry, The ruin my gold would buy. But I'd break the fetters of care worn things, And be spirit and fancy free; My mind should go up where it longs to go, And the limitless wind outflee. I'd climb to the eyries of eagle men Till the stars became a scroll; And pour right on, like the even sea, In the strength of a governed soul. Ambition! Ambition! I've laughed to scorn Thy robe and thy gleaming sword; I would follow sooner a woman's eye, Or the spell of a gentle word; But come with the glory of human mind, And the light of the scholar's brow, And my heart shall be taught forgetfulness, And alone at thy altar bow. There was one dark eye—it hath passed away! There was one deep tone—'t is not! Could I see it now—could I hear it now, Ye were all too well forgot. My heart brought up, from its chambers deep, The sum of its earthly love; But it might not—could not—buy like Heaven, And she stole to her rest above. That first deep love I have taken back, In my rayless heart to hide, With the tear it brought for a burning seal, 'T will there forever bide. I may stretch on now to a nobler ken, I may live in my thoughts of flame— The tie is broken that kept me back, And my spirit is on, for fame! But alas! I am dreaming as if I knew The spell of the tablet green; I forget how like to a broken reed, Is the lot on which I lean. There is nothing true of my idle dream, But the wreck of my early love; And my mind is coined for my daily bread, And how can it soar above? END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Dear Berville— `It is, I believe, or should be, a maxim of the true church, that confession of a sin is the first step towards its expiation. `Let me, then, invest you with a priest's cassock, and relieve my conscience by the relation of an odd episode in my history. When I parted from you, I was going with my friend, Robert Ellison, to visit his father, who has a beautiful place on the banks of the Hudson. Young Ellison, as you know, is a thorough republican, and does not conceal his contempt for those of his compatriots, who, professing the same principles, are really aristocrats in their prejudices and manners; who, having parted, and as they pretend voluntarily, with the substance, still grasp at the shadow. To test these false pretensions, and to mortify an absurd pride, he joyfully acquiesced in a proposition I made to him, to lay aside the pomp and circumstance of my official character, and to be presented to his friends without any of the accidental advantages with which fortune has invested me. You will inquire my motive, for you will not suspect me of the absurdity of crusading against the follies of society, the most hopeless of all crusades. No, as our own Moliére says, C'est une folie, à nulle autre seconde, De vouloir se mêler de corriger le monde. My motives were then, in the first place, a love of ease, of dishabille; an impatience of the irksomeness of having the dignity of a nation to sustain; and, in the second place, I wished to ascertain how much of the favor lavished on me I should place to the account of the ambassador, and how much I might reserve to my own proper self. `You may call this latent vanity. I will not quarrel with you. I will not pretend that I was moved solely by a love of truth, by a pure desire to find out the realities of things; but alas! my dear Berville, if we were to abstract from the web of our motives, every thread tinged with self, would not warp and woof too disappear? Let, then, my motive be what it might, you will allow the experiment required courage. `We had some difficulty in settling the precise point at which to gage my pretensions. “Do not claim a drop of noble blood,” said my friend, “it would defeat your purpose. There is something cabalistic in that word `noble.' The young ladies at — would at once invest you with the attributes of romance; and the old dowagers would persecute you with histories of their titled ancestors, and anecdotes of lords and ladies that figured in the drawing rooms of the colony. Neither must you be a plain gentleman of fortune, though that may seem to you a sufficient descent from your high station; but fortune has everywhere her shrines and her devotees. You must be the artificer of your own fortune, a talented young man who has no rank or fortune to be spoken of. What say you to the profession of a painter, a portrait painter, since that is the only branch of the art that gets a man bread in this country.” I acceded without shrinking, secretly flattering myself that my friend either underrated my intrinsic merit, or did the world rank injustice. `When we arrived we found a large party of the neighbouring gentry assembled to dine at —. I was received with great courtesy by the elder Ellison, and with kindness by Madame, on the ground, simply, of being an acquaintance of their son's. My friend took care to prevent any elation from my reception by saying to me in a low voice, “My father, God bless him, has good sense, good feeling, and experience, and he well knows that the value of gold does not depend on the circulation it has obtained;” and truly if he had known that I bore the impress of the king's countenance he could not have received me more graciously. There might have been more formality in his reception of the public functionary, but there could not have been more genuine hospitality. He presented me to his guests, and here I was first reminded of my disguise. Instead of the sensation I have been accustomed to see manifested in the lighting up of the face, in the deferential bow, or the blush of modesty, no emotion was visible. No eye rested on me, not a link of conversation was broken, and I was suffered, after rather an awkward passage through the ceremony, to retire to my seat, where I remained, observing, but not observed, till dinner was announced. From the habit of precedence, I was advancing to lead Madame to the dining room, when I encountered my friend's glance, and shrunk back in time to avoid what must have appeared an unpardonable impertinence. I now fell into my modest station in the rear, and offered my arm to an awkward, bashful girl, who I am sure had two left hands by the manner in which she received my courtesy, and who did not honor me so far as to look up to see who it was that had saved her from the mortifying dilemma of leaving the drawingroom alone. I helped my companion from the dish nearest to me, and waited myself till Madame, reminded by her son of her oversight, sent me a plate of soup. I was swallowing this, unmolested by any conversation addressed to me, when my friend's father said to him, “When have you seen the French ambassador, Robert? I hoped you would have persuaded him to pay us a visit.” “`Perhaps he may,” replied my friend, “before the summer is over. He is at present out of the city on some excursion.” “`A prodigious favorite is your son with the French ambassador, as I hear from all quarters,” said a gentleman who sat next Mr Ellison. “`Ah! is that so, Robert? Are you intimate with Monsieur —?” “`He does me the honor to permit my society, sir.” Every mouth was now opened in praise of the ambassador. None of the company had seen him, but all had heard of his abilities, the charms of his conversation, his urbanity, his savoir plaire. “You must be proud of your countryman, M. Dufau?” (this was my assumed name) said my host, with that courtesy that finds a word for the humblest guest. `I said it was certainly gratifying to my national feeling to find him approved in America, but that, perhaps it was not his merit alone that obtained him such distinguished favor; that I had understood he was a great admirer of this country, and though I should do him injustice to say “he praised, only to be praised,” yet I believed there was always a pretty accurately measured exchange in this traffic. “`The gentleman is right,” said an old Englishman who sat opposite to me, and who had not before vouchsafed to manifest a consciousness of my existence; “this is all French palaver in Monsieur —. He cannot be such a warm admirer of this country. The man knows better; he has been in England.” `I was too well acquainted with English manners to be startled by any manifestation of that conviction which an Englishman demonstrates in every part of the world, that his nation has no equal; but I instinctively defended my countryman, and eager for an opportunity to test the colloquial powers so much admired in the ambassador, I entered the lists with my English opponent, and thus stimulated, I was certainly far more eloquent than I ever had been before, on the history, the present condition, and the prospects of this country. But alas for the vanity of M. Dufau! my host, it is true, gave me all the attention he could spare from the courtesies of the table, but save his ear, I gained none but that half accorded by my contemptuous, testy, and impatient antagonist, who after barking out a few sentences at me, relapsed into a moody silence. `I next addressed some trifling gallantries to my bashful neighbour, fancying that she who was neglected by everybody else, would know how to appreciate my attentions; but her eyes were rivetted to a fashionable beauty at the upper extremity of the table, and a half a dozen “no, sirs” and “yes, sirs,” misplaced, were all the return I could obtain from her. To remain silent and passive, you know, to me, was impossible; so I next made an essay on a vinegar faced dame on my left, far in the wane of life. “If my civilities have been lead elsewhere, in this market,” thought I, “they will at least prove silver or gold.” But here I received my cruellest rebuff; for the lady, after apparently listening to me, said, “I do not understand you.” I raised my voice, but she, determining to shelter the infirmity of age at my expense, replied, “I am not so deaf, sir, but really you speak such broken English, that I cannot understand you.” This was too much, and I might have betrayed my vexation, if an intelligent and laughing glance from my friend had not restored my good humor, and a second reflection, suggesting that it was far more important to the old woman's happiness that her vanity should remain unimpaired, than it could be to me to have mine reduced, even to fragments, I humbly begged her pardon, and relapsed into a contented silence, solacing myself with the thought, that our encounter was but an illustration of that of the china and earthen jars. But I will not weary you with detailing all the trials of my philosophy, but only confess that the negligence of the servants was not the least of them—the grinning self-complacency with which these apes of their superiors signified to me that my wants might be deferred. `After all, my humble position would not have been so disagreeable, if I had been accustomed to it. The world's admiration, like all other luxuries, in the end becomes necessary, and then, too, like other luxuries, ceases to be enjoyed, or even felt, till it is withdrawn and leaves an aching void. If this is Irish, set it down to my broken English. `After dinner, I followed the ladies to the drawingroom, and was presented by my friend to Miss —, a reigning beauty. She received me with one of those gracious smiles, that a hacknied belle always bestows on a new worshipper at her shrine. These popular favorites, be it clergyman, politician, or beauty, are as covetous of the flatteries they receive, as a miser is of gold. No matter how unclean the vessel from which the incense rises; no matter what base alloy may mingle with the precious metal. Have you ever encountered one of these spoiled favorites in the thronged street, and tried to arrest the attention for a moment; to fix the eye that was roving for every tributary glance? If you have, you will understand without my describing it, the distrait manner with which the belle received my first compliments. Even this was not long accorded me, for a better accredited and more zealous admirer than myself appearing, she left me to my meditations, which were not rendered the more agreeable by my overhearing an old lady say, in a voice, which, though slightly depressed, she evidently made no effort to subdue to an inaudible key, “I wonder what possessed Robert Ellison to bring that French portrait painter here! How the world has changed since the Revolution! There is no longer any house where you don't meet mixed society.” My friend had approached in time to overhear her as well as myself. “The ignorant old fool!” he exclaimed, “shall I tell her that artists are the nobility of every country?” “`No,” said I, “do not waste your rhetoric; there is no enlightening the ignorance of stupidity; a black substance will not reflect even the sun's rays.” `Ellison then proposed that I should join a party at whist; but I complained of the heated air of the drawingroom, and, availing myself of my insignificance, I followed the bent of my inclinations, a privilege the humble should not undervalue, and sauntered abroad. The evening was beautiful enough to have soothed a misanthrope, or warmed the heart of a stoic. Its peace, its salutary, sacred voice restored me to myself, and I was ashamed that my tranquillity had been disturbed. I contemned the folly of the artificial distinctions of life, and felt quite indifferent to them—when alone. `The ground in front of my friend's house slopes to the Hudson, and is still embellished with trees of the majestic native growth. Where nature has left anything to be supplied by art, walks have been arranged and planted; but carefully, so as not to impede the view of the river, which was now in perfect repose. A sloop lay in the channel, its sails all furled, idly floating on the slumbering surface. While I was wishing my friend were with me, for I am too much of a Frenchman to relish fully even nature, the favorite companion of sentimentalists, in solitude, I saw a boat put off from the little vessel, and row slowly towards the shore. Presently a sweet female voice swelled on the stillness of the night, accompanied by the notes of a guitar, struck by a practised hand. Could any young man's mercury resist moonlight and such music? Mine could not, and I very soon left behind me all of terra firma that intervened between me and the siren, and ensconced myself in a deeply shaded nook at the very water's edge, where I could see and hear without being observed. The boat approached the spot where I stood, and was moored at half a dozen yards from my feet; but as my figure was in shadow, and sheltered by a thick copse of hazel bushes, I was perfectly concealed, while, by a flood of moonbeams, that poured on my unsuspicious neighbours, I saw them as plainly as if it were daylight. These were two men, whom I soon ascertained to be the captain VOL. I. 13 of the sloop and an attendant, and that they were going to a farm house in the neighbourhood for eggs, milk, &amp;c. The two females were to remain in the boat till their return. The lady of the guitar was inclined to go with them as far as the oak wood on the brow of the hill; but the captain persuaded her to remain in the boat, by telling her there was a formidable dog on the place, which she might encounter. As soon as the captain was gone, her companion, an elderly, staid looking country woman, said to her, “Now, child, as I came here for your pleasure, you must sing for mine. None of your newfangled fancies, but good Old Robin Grey.” “`Oh, Robin Grey is a doleful ditty; but anything to reward you for indulging me in coming on shore.” `She then sung that touching ballad. The English, certainly the Scotch, excel us as much in the pathos of unembellished nature and truth, as we do them in all literary refinement, ingenuity, and grace. I know not how much of the tribute that gushed from my heart was paid to the poetry and music, and how much to the beautiful organ by which they were expressed, for the fair musician looked herself like one of the bright creations of poetry. I would describe her, but description is cold and quite inadequate to convey an idea of her, and of the scene with which she harmonized. It was one of nature's sweetest accords; the balmy air, the cloudless sky, the river, reflecting like a spotless mirror the blue arch, the moon and her bright train; my enchantress, the embodied spirit of the evening, and her music the voice of nature. I might have forgotten that I was in human mould, but I had one effectual curb to my imagination; one mortal annoyance. Argus, confound him! had followed me from the house, and it was only by dint of continued coaxing and caressing that I could keep him quiet. Before the ballad was finished, however, he was soothed by its monotonous sadness, and crouching at my feet, he fell asleep, I believe. I forgot him. Suddenly “the dainty spirit” changed from the low breathings of melancholy to a gay French air—the very air, Berville, that Claudine, in her mirthful moments, used to sing to us. The transition was so abrupt that it seemed as if the wing of joy had swept over the strings of her instrument. I started forth from my concealment. That was not all. Argus sprang out, too, and barking furiously, bounded towards the boat. The old woman screamed, “There is the dog!” and the young lady, not less terrified, dropped her guitar, and, unhooking the boat, she seized an oar and pushed it off without listening to my apologies and assurances. In her agitation she dropped the oar, and her companion, still more tremulous than herself, in her attempt to regain it, lost the other, which she had instinctively grasped. As soon as the first impulse imparted to the boat was expended, it scarcely moved at all, and I had leisure to explain my sudden appearance, and to say that my dog, far from being the formidable animal they imagined, was a harmless spaniel, who should immediately make all the amends in his power for the terror he had caused. I then directed him to the floating oars. He plunged into the water and brought them to me, but he either did not, or would not understand my wish that he should convey them to the boat, which, though very slowly, was evidently receding from the shore. I then, without farther hesitation, threw off my coat, swam to the boat, and receiving there the oars from Argus's mouth, I soon reconducted the boat to its haven. There was something enchanting to me in the frankness with which my fair musician expressed her pleasure at the homage I had involuntarily paid to her art, and the grace with which she received the slight service I rendered her. Perhaps I felt it the more for the mortifying experience of the day. I do not care very nicely to analyze my feelings, nor to ascertain how much there was of restored self complacency in the delicious excitement of that hour.' `The elderly lady, for lady she must needs be since my fair incognita called her mother, expressed a matronly solicitude about the effect of my wet garments, but I assured her that I apprehended no inconvenience from them, and I begged to be allowed to remain at my station till the return of their attendants. The circumstances of our introduction had been such as to dissipate all ceremony. Indeed, this characteristic of English manners would have as ill fitted the trustful, ingenuous, and gay disposition of my new acquaintance, as a coat of mail her light, graceful person. She sung, at my request, our popular opera airs, with more effect, because with far more feeling, than our best professed artists. She talked of music, and of the poetry of nature, with genius and taste; and she listened with that eager and pleased attention, which is the second best gift of conversation. I should have taken no note of the passage of time but for the fidgetting of the old lady, who often interrupted us with expressions of her concern at the captain's delay, for which he, quite too soon, appeared to render an account himself. As I was compelled to take my leave, I asked my fair unknown if I might not be allowed to think of her by some more accurate designation than the “Lady of the Guitar.” “`My name is”—she replied promptly, and then, after a moment's hesitation, added, “No—pardon me, your romantic designation better suits the adventure of the night.” I was vexed at my disappointment, but she chased away the shade of displeasure by the graceful playfulness with which she kissed her hand to me as the boat pushed off. I lingered on the shore till she had reached the vessel, and then slowly retraced my steps towards the house. I was startled by meeting my friend, for my mind was so absorbed that I had not heard his approaching footstep. “Ah!” he exclaimed, `is this your philosophy? turned misanthrope at the first frown from the world?” “`My philosophy,” I replied, “has neither been vanquished, nor has it conquered, for I had forgotten all its trials.” `My friend evidently believed, notwithstanding my disclaimer, that my vanity required some indemnity for the humiliations it had sustained, and he repeated to me some assuaging compliments from his father. “But,” he concluded, “tell me, have you really turned sentimentalist, and been holding high converse with the stars?” `With a most brilliant star,' I replied, and related my adventure. `Ellison's curiosity was excited, and he proposed we should take our flutes, go out in the barge, and serenade the “Lady of the Guitar.” I, of course, assented, and the next half hour found us floating around the little vessel like humble satellites. We played an accompaniment and sung alternately, he in English, and I in French; but there was no token given that the offered incense was accepted; no salutation, save a coarse one from the captain, who invited us to go “on board and take some grog.” We of course declined his professional courtesy. “Then, for the Lord's sake, lads,” he said, “stop your piping, and give us a good birth. Sleep, at this time o' night, is better music than the jolliest tune that ever was played.” `Thus dismissed, and discomfited by the lady's neglect, we resumed our oars and were preparing to return to the shore, when the cabin window was gently raised, 13* and our fair incognita sung a sweet little French air, beginning “Adieu, adieu!” We remained, sound, motion, almost breath suspended till the song was finished.' “So sweetly she bids us adieu, I think that she bids us return,” said my friend, and we instantly rowed our boat towards the stern of the vessel. At this moment the sash was suddenly dropped, and taking this for a definitive “Good night,” we retired. `Now, dear Berville, I have faithfully related the adventures of my masquerade—my boyish pastime, you may call it. Be it so. This day has been worth a year of care and dignity. I shall return to New York in a few days. Till then farewell. Yours, Constant.' But though M. Constant professed himself satisfied with his day, there was a lurking disquietude at his heart. He had written to assure himself there was nothing there he dare not express, and yet he had concluded without once alluding to the cause of his self-reproach. He had folded the letter, but he opened it, and added;— `P. S. I did not describe to you my friend's vexation that the responded song was in French. “Ah!” said he, “I see there is no chance for such poor devils as I, so long as you are neither married nor betrothed.”'</field>

The favorable manner in which the first volume of the Token has been received, has induced the subscriber to enter upon early arrangements for publishing another volume for the succeeding year. The Token for 1828 was produced under many disadvantages, arising from want of experience, and the lateness of the period at which it was commenced. The volume for 1829, it is hoped, will not suffer from these causes. The editorial department will be superintended by N. P. Willis, Esq., and preparations are making to bring the work forward in a superior manner in every respect. Contributions are solicited, and the most liberal compensation will be given for the pieces that are inserted. The names of the writers will be given as in the London and Atlantic Souvenirs. It is requested that none of the articles may exceed twenty-five pages, when printed; and that all communications for the work may be forwarded to the subscriber before the fifteenth of June next. S.
