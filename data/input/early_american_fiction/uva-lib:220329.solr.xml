      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. In presenting a work of fiction by a new candidate for public favour, courtesy should induce the author to submit a fitting cause for obtruding himself in a circle rendered illustrious by an array of talent and virtue unsurpassed in any other walk of literature. Claiming no pretensions to equality with the master spirits who so worthily wield the sceptre in the empire of imagination, the author of the present volumes presumes but to follow at an humble distance the more distinguished of his contemporaries, and is rather a worshipper at their shrine than a pretender to rivalry near the throne. Whether he has attained even partial success is not for him to determine. The theme chosen, and the period selected for its illustration, renders the work amenable to universal criticism. That the general knowledge of the times and scenes imbodied in the tale has its disadvantages, will not be denied. Independent of the facility with which the reader can detect errors, the very familiarity of the subject tends to divest it of some of the most attractive attributes of a work of imagination. In tracing events supposed to have existed in the more renowned sections of the Old World; in reproducing the poets, statesmen, or sages who have figured in their annals; and in sketching scenes which the imagination of youth and the memory of age combine to invest with the colours of the rainbow, the author can deviate somewhat from fidelity of outline and truth of detail without detracting materially from the general interest of the narrative. The learned critic, it is true, may expose defects and prove discrepancies; but his dictum either fails to arrest attention, or is drowned in the shouts of general applause. The vicissitudes in the history of the principal personage of the tale are such as have befallen many in the struggle for eminence; and if their delineation should instil into the breasts of any of his countrymen fortitude under privations and perseverance under difficulties, the author will not have written in vain. New-York, June, 1839.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A 2 SYDNEY CLIFTON. CHAPTER I. A DESPERATE CHARACTER.—SCENE IN A NEW-YORK AUBERGE.—SECRETS WORTH KNOWING. “He, born, perchance, for better things, had set His life upon a cast which lingered yet: But now the die was to be thrown, and all The chances were in favour of his fall.” * * * * * “Silent, and sad, and savage—with the trace Of passion reeking from his clouded face.” The Island, by Lord Byron It was near the close of a gloomy and cheerless day in November, anno domini 18—, that two ill-clad men were seen to enter one of those minor houses of entertainment which abound in certain localities in the city of New-York. The individual who first entered appeared little past the prime of life, and possessed a frame that seemed equally endowed with strength and activity. In height he was somewhat beyond that usually designated as the middle size; and although his black bushy hair was slightly sprinkled with gray, yet his firm and elastic step and erect carriage denoted the possession of unimpaired bodily energies. His dress had little to distinguish him from the mechanic or labourer, being composed of a drab peacoat and trousers; but the hat, which was placed somewhat jauntily on the side of his head, retained some faded evidences of former fashion and elegance, leaving the beholder in doubt whether to class its wearer among the numerous race of brokendown gentlemen, or as one who chose to deck a portion of his outward man in their discarded habiliments. As his face was momentarily turned to the light, it presented a bold and regular profile; but a dark and chilling scowl from time to time flitted across his features, and the frank bearing he assumed was belied by involuntary glances of suspicion and distrust. His companion was short in stature and less muscular in frame; and although his years were less in number than those of his associate, yet the effects of recent disease impaired the elasticity of his movements. His dress was that usually worn by seamen, a short blue jacket, drab trousers, whose lack of width at the hip was abundantly compensated by extra dimensions below the knee, a glazed hat, and sealskin pumps. In his face there was little to attract observation, if we except a combined, or, rather, varied expression of low cunning and reckless gayety, which were so equally blended that it was impossible to judge which habitually maintained the ascendant. A single glance at the furniture of the room into which these personages found entrace, indicated the shrine at which its votaries offered incense. The rude bar, the soiled decanters, filled with those adulterated liquids so aptly termed by the American aborigines “fire water,” the stained table, on which lay scattered a pack of playing cards, and the rickety and dismembered chairs, were unerring testimonials of the character of the tavern, its keeper, and its frequenters. Behind the apology for a bar stood an individual in the prime of life, but whose inflamed eye, swollen cheek, and premature wrinkles imparted a tale of vicious indulgence which had already sapped the foundation of a naturally vigorous constitution. By the side of the deal table sat a youth, apparently on the verge of manhood, whose lack-lustre eyes were momentarily attracted by the entrance of the two visiters; but, after a careless glance, his head again drooped over the table in real or affected unconsciousness. As the visiters entered, they directed the bar-keeper to furnish them with refreshments, and retired to an apartment in the rear of that to which the attention of the reader has been directed. “Well, Maddox,” said the one first described, as they seated themselves, “of all the cronies that have played hide and seek in my affections since we met, none have retained their first station like you. Indeed, my good fellow, if I was only to tell the scurvy tricks that not less than half a score of our very good friends have played me within the time that our fortunes have separated us, I should only mar the present hour with gloom. But never fear, I'll pretend for the next half hour that there are clever fellows in the world besides ourselves, and that is long enough to deceive one's self or one's friend, in all conscience.” “Why, Glenthorne,” replied his companion, “I'm glad to see you in good spirits. 'Faith, old Squaretoes himself could scarcely look blacker than you did the last time I met you in Boston. I thought you were watching me for fear I'd blow you; but, as long as you play fair, all's right, my old boy.” Whatever might have been the nature of the allusion uttered by Maddox, its effect on his auditor was of the most exciting description, and the complacent smile that welcomed his quondam associate was instantly changed to a look of unmitigated ferocity. “What do you mean?” he shouted, with great violence; and, at the same time springing forward, he caught his victim by the throat with so vicelike a gripe, that his tongue was thrust out and his whole face became livid. “By heavens! a word more to the same purpose, and I'll leave you a corpse at my feet.” The struggle brought forth the landlord and the youth from the barroom; but, on their appearance, the assailant relaxed his grasp, and, apologizing to the parties for his violence, he, with much apparent contrition, solicited pardon from his prostrate foe, who was unable, from exhaustion, to return an intelligible reply. After this equivocal exhibition of affection on the part of Glenthorne, the conversation was evidently constrained; and although the assailant endeavoured, by every means in his power, to sooth the irritated feelings of Maddox, it was apparent that his progress was in an inverse ratio to his exertions, until, abandoning the effort, he swallowed the remains of his potation, and with a hasty “good-evening” left the house. No sooner had his footsteps ceased to echo from the threshold, than Maddox beckoned the youth from his meditations in the barroom, and, after a hasty conference, the latter issued forth in the direction taken by Glenthorne. Meanwhile that individual, with rapid strides, threaded the narrow and filthy streets that intersected the quarter of the city in which the tavern was situated, until he reached a broader and more commodious thoroughfare, when, sliding into the porch of a fruiterer's shop at one of the corners, he gave a long and piercing survey of the route he had traversed, scanning the lineaments of each individual within the scope of his vision, till, apparently satisfied with the scrutiny, he more leisurely joined the throng that poured along one of the most busy streets of the metropolis. Directing his course to a distant part of the city, he entered a low and weather-beaten dwelling, and hastily ascended the stairway to a room in the rear of the second story. The sharp, shrill bark of a stunted terrier saluted his entrance; but, as the door swung open sufficiently to discover his person, the savage growl of the animal was changed to a friendly whine of recognition, which was answered by a kick that sent the poor brute howling to the opposite corner of the room. If the outward appearance of the dwelling indicated the abode of indigence, nothing presented itself within the apartment to weaken or efface the impression. A few broken and unmatched chairs, a narrow cott at one side of the room and a bed at the other, the covering of both much frayed and worn, a decayed bureau, a dilapidated travelling-trunk, and a few rude cooking utensils, constituted the principal articles of ornament or use in the room, which appeared to serve the purposes of parlour, bedroom, and kitchen. By the side of the hearth, where a few expiring embers were struggling to retain a feeble existence, sat a female, apparently of some twenty-five years of age, in whose sunken eye and faded cheek might be discovered the remains of much beauty and intelligence; and although her attenuated frame had lost the voluptuous fulness of its early prime, there was that in the symmetrical curve of her neck and shoulder, the delicate tapering of the fingers and the chiselled lip, that would arrest the attention of the most indifferent observer. The exclamation, in the silvery tones of her voice, “Down, Trimmer, down,” was heard simultaneously with the howl of the terrified animal, which sought shelter from farther injury behind the chair of his indulgent mistress. “Curse the dog, I wish I had dashed out his brains,” grimly exclaimed Glenthorne; “curse him; he is something like the mistresses and wives of the present day, who only wait till misfortunes have buffeted their paramours or husbands to join the world of curs in yelping at their heels. “By the gods! I don't know what women and terriers were made for, except as a penance to fit us for the heaven that fools and bigots prate about.” With this affectionate salute the speaker threw himself on a chair. The barking of the dog and the loud tones of Glenthorne's voice awoke a child of some three years of age, who occupied the cott; but, on raising his little head and perceiving the form of the speaker, he suddenly drew himself under the clothing, and his deep short breathing was all that thereafter indicated his presence. To these taunts of her associate the female retorted with warmth, until, evidently overcome by her emotions, her head drooped on the back of the chair, and she sobbed in very bitterness of spirit. Before this silent rebuke the sternness of the reviler relaxed, and after some inaudible mutterings rather to himself than to his weeping auditor, he suddenly started up, exclaiming, “But why do I remain here to be caged like a wild beast; already the bloodhounds of the law are probably on my track, lapping their hungry jaws for the repast. By heavens! if they do come they shall not gain a bloodless victory. I can die but once, and I'll leave behind me gory evidences of the prowess of one against whom society has warred with unrelenting fury. “Why, again I say, let them come; there is that in these trusty friends (the only true ones I ever possessed) that shall make a pair of them at least bite the dust.” While closing this fierce soliloquy he opened one of the drawers of the bureau, in which were deposited a pair of silver-mounted pistols; and examining the priming with some care, and ascertaining that they were in a condition for action, he deposited them on the top of the bureau, and carefully secured the fastenings of the only door through which intruders could find entrance. Apparently satisfied with these preparations, he resumed his seat, but the fall of his companion from her chair in a swoon suddenly arrested his attention. Springing from his seat in great agitation, he drew a bottle of spirits from a closet, and applying it to the forehead and temples of the sufferer, at length succeeded in restoring her to animation, but it was a considerable time ere her palsied faculties appeared to resume their functions. Slowly gazing around the apartment, her eyes no sooner rested on the pistols, than, uttering a faint shriek, she relapsed into unconsciousness, which was, however, of brief duration. “What dreadful words were those you uttered?” was her first exclamation on her revival; “did you not say that they were seeking your life? Speak, do speak, or my heart will break; for the love of Vol. I.—B Heaven keep me not in suspense, but let me know the worst. Although you did speak harshly a moment since, I know that you are aware of my fidelity and affection, and that, if they lead you to death, they shall bury me in the same grave with you. But no! no! it cannot be! Say that it was a dream, or say that you did but mock me, and I will fall down and worship you.” In the sternest and most obdurate natures there are sympathetic influences that lie concealed until aroused by a master spell, and the heart of Glenthorne was not proof against the earnest and passionate appeal of the lovely and confiding being at his side. Summoning, therefore, a blandness of manner that to her was as rare as it was delightful, he briefly detailed the events already recorded; and while he admitted the probability of Maddox's ignorance of his retreat, he yet expressed a firm determination of removing to some other quarter of the globe. “Where I fly,” said he, musingly, “is but of little consequence; while I herd with human beings, I must expect treachery to poison the very air I breathe; and whether it lurks beneath the turban of the Turk, the mustache of the Spaniard, or the hypocritical leer of the puritanical Yankee, is a matter of indifference. Suffice it for me to know that I am at war with all my race; and were not my pride enlisted to defeat the schemes of that reptile Maddox, who seems to be thrown by some devil across my track, the present is as propitious a moment as will arrive to select the manner of my exit from this den of vipers.” It is the curse of guilt to be compelled to select its instruments and auxiliaries from the very hotbeds of treachery, thus converting the elements of success into implements of detection and punishment; and the anxious and careworn countenance of Glenthorne attested the fact, that, whatever might have been the nature of his misdeeds, the enjoyment that had marked their inception, progress, and execution was now ingulfed in the apprehended consequences of Maddox's anticipated disclosure. The reader must not infer, from the seeming confidence which he reposed in his companion, that he had imparted to her the true cause of his disquietude. Being fully aware of the impracticability of entirely concealing the hazard that he daily incurred of detection, his ingenuity was taxed in manufacturing a statement in which misrepresentations were so artfully interwoven with immaterial facts, that a less favourable auditor than he possessed would have failed to detect the semblance of improbability in the story. Most true it is, that there were moments in which an unwonted display of brutality on his part would arouse unwelcome suspicions; but the slightest appearance of kindness and regard would banish intruders so alien to her bosom. It is justly remarked, that in the breast of none does superstition hold so absolute a supremacy as in those over whom the sword of destiny or justice is suspended, like that of Damocles, by a hair, and Glenthorne's apprehensions were much aggravated by the recollection of an ominous dream that had disturbed his slumbers on the previous night. He thought he was sailing in a pleasure barge, on the bosom of a placid lake, when suddenly a squall struck the boat and precipitated him and his companions into the waves; and while he was struggling to gain the shore, a serpent coiled itself around him, and as its slimy folds were encircling his throat, its head suddenly assumed the features of Maddox, grinning with delight at his expiring struggles. Long in imagination did he wrestle with the reptile, until his agitation awoke his companion, who relieved him from the dominion of the horrid nightmare. The casual meeting with Maddox, and the events connected therewith, appeared to his excited mind as a partial fulfilment of the omen; and it was not until he had braced his nerves with artificial stimulus that he could coolly reflect on the proper means to elude the vigilance of his adversary. Long, anxious, and absorbing was the conversation that ensued between Glenthorne and his chere amie (for, alas! wedlock had not sanctioned their union); and when, at its close, he pressed her to his bosom with a tender kiss, tears of joy, such as had long remained sealed in their fountains, flowed in streams down her cheek; and it is doubtful whether, in the first flush of gratified passion, her heart bounded with such perfect felicity as on the reception of this long-withheld evidence of her companion's regard. As the evening was far spent, the guilty man and his unhappy victim retired to rest; and reposing on the bosom of him for whom she had relinquished reputation and innocence, she sunk into a slumber so calm that it is difficult to believe, whatever were her frailties, that they had not found a successful advocate at the mercy-seat of Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. NATURE'S ECCENTRICITIES.—A CONTRAST.—THE BEGINNING OF THE END.—ONE CRIME BEGETS ITS FELLOW.—SCENE IN THE CITY WATCHHOUSE. “First on the head of him who did this deed My curse shall light.” The Curse of Minerva. The observer of nature in all her phases cannot fail to have remarked the tendency of mind and matter to form alliances with their opposites. The delicate tendrils of the vine embrace the trunk of the sturdy oak with sympathetic tenacity; by the side of the mountain torrent, and on the verge of the dizzy precipice, flowers, the beauty of whose tints shame the colours of the rainbow, scatter their richest perfumes; and around the riven arch, the prostrate column, and the mouldering fane, vegetation arrays her most gorgeous trophies. B 2 Although, in the animal world, the beautiful prediction in the inspired volume, that the “lion shall lie down with the lamb,” has not yet been fulfilled, still instances of attachment between natures not less incongruous are not wanting, to puzzle the wits of the seeker after analogies and affinities. In the great collection of wild beasts in the royal menagerie of London, the lordly lion formed an attachment of the most endearing character with a whiffet that was thrown into his cage to be devoured; and an array of well-authenticated facts of the like description could be produced, if necessary, to establish the prevalence of this characteristic in the brute creation. But if the material and animal world abound with proofs of the verity of the hypothesis, in man the phenomenon has achieved its most wonderful triumph. At every step of our journey along the highway of life, we meet gentleness and modesty hand in hand with blustering arrogance, high-souled integrity paired with smooth-faced deceit, and unbridled licentiousness sustaining the form of unsullied purity. The attachment of ladies below the ordinary size to gentlemen of the grenadier standard is proverbial; while genius, with its sublime aspirations, its delicate perception of the beautiful and the grand, and its longings for ideal excellence, is not unfrequently content to wed with folly and deformity. Whether the ancient practice of placing an individual near the person of the monarch who was professionally known as the “king's fool,” originated in this eccentricity of nature, or whether the beams that emanated from the wisdom of royalty were too intense to be gazed on by the multitude without summoning the shadows of folly to mitigate their force, is not for transatlantic republicans to determine. Well are we aware that there have not been wanting rebellious and perverse democrats, who have insinuated that the “king's fool” was selected for the sole purpose of diverting public attention from the imbecility of the “Lord's anointed;” and some have not scrupled to aver that the fool often possessed the wiser head of the two; but slanders so gross carry with them their own refutation, and happily relieve us veritable historians from the necessity of chastising their authors. But in whatever form this attraction in apparent opposites has displayed itself in others, certain it is that Glenthorne and the female with whom he consorted afforded a most striking illustration of its existence and its power. In her, nature had combined the beauty of form and purity of mind that give so powerful a charm to the female character. Educated under the supervision of tender and affectionate parents, her budding charms, as they developed themselves in early womanhood, were only equalled by the fascinations of her mind; and at the age of nineteen she might have been pronounced one of the most beautiful and accomplished ladies of whom the continent of America could boast. If she possessed any constitutional defect, it was that of exaggerated susceptibility to all the influences of passion and feeling, lending a tinge of romance to a mind that would otherwise have possessed the perfection of judgment and discrimination. Glenthorne, on the contrary, without originally possessing all the faults that marked his subsequent career, was stern, licentious, vindictive, and overbearing. Long previous to his acquaintance with his unfortunate victim, his passions had attained a complete mastery over his judgment; and, as has been seen in his interview with Maddox, even the most powerful considerations of personal safety failed to restrain his unruly temper within prudent limits. At the time of their first acquaintance he had numbered nearly twice her years; and although his education was such as entitled him to a respectable station in mixed society, yet the cultivation of his mental powers had failed to remove a certain air of vulgar assurance that did not pass without remark from impartial observers. To the lady, however, he proved irresistible; and the first intimation that her relatives had of her attachment was conveyed in a brief letter written by herself on eloping with her lover. With their subsequent career, up to the period in which they were introduced to the reader, this portion of our history has no connexion, and we therefore return to the humble dwelling in which they temporarily resided. To the exhausted female, the repose that followed scenes of so exciting and agitating a tendency was calm and overpowering; but to her guilty companion no such boon was vouchsafed. Goaded by the demon of remorse, and shuddering at the dark precipice that yawned in fearful distinctness before him, his fancy continually conjured up images of detection and punishment which no efforts of judgment could dissipate. Wearied at length with vain attempts to silence the voice of the monitor within, he gently glided from the side of his mistress, and, after hastily arranging his dress, lighted a taper, and continued to pace the floor in a state of feeling that was in itself a heavy punishment of his offences. This occupation had been pursued but for a brief space, when several voices heard in the street directly opposite the house were quickly succeeded by a gentle tap at the outer door, which was from time to time repeated, until a cartman, who occupied lower apartments in the dwelling, demanded the cause of so unseasonable an intrusion. The reply was couched in terms sufficiently ambiguous; but, after a brief colloquy, the door was opened, and the heavy tread of several persons was heard passing through the narrow hall and ascending the flight of steps that led to the apartment of the sleepless Glenthorne. While these events were taking place below, he again had resort to the bottle; and, after a lengthened draught, he summoned those energies which had on all former occasions developed powers equal to the emergency, but which appeared on the present to fail in directing him to any feasible plan of escape. Resorting, therefore, to the desperate resolution of selling his life as dearly as possible, he grasped his pistols, and awaited in silence the appearance of his captors. After a brief conversation in an under tone, in which the quickened ear of Glenthorne detected the voice of Maddox, a powerful assault was made on the door, the fastenings of which proved treacherous, and the assailants rushed in a body into the room. The report of two pistols followed in rapid succession, and the heavy fall of one of the intruders attested the fatal skill that had been exhibited in their discharge. A shrill and almost childlike shriek succeeded; and, casting his eyes on the prostrate form of the wounded individual, Glenthorne recognised the youth whose presence at the tavern was noticed in the previous chapter. “Confound the foolish boy,” he muttered through his teeth; “why did he thrust his womanish face between me and the scoundrel Maddox? I'd barter my hopes of heaven for another shot at that villain's heart.” The strong grasp of the minions of the law interrupted his vindictive speech; and appearing convinced of the futility of farther attempts at resistance, he passively submitted to the manacles that were placed on his arms. As may be inferred, these eventful occurrences did not fail to arouse the sleeping inmates of the apartment. So sudden was the onset, and so rapidly passed the events that succeeded, that the bewildered female was incapable of comprehending the nature of the uproar, until the fall of the youth and the seizure of Glenthorne developed the catastrophe in all its horrors. Springing from the bed in her night clothes, and insensible to everything but the safety of him she loved, she rushed to his side in an agony of terror. By this time Maddox, who, on the discharge of Glenthorne's pistols, had prudently retired to the rear of the party, now that he was secured, valiantly placed himself forward and confronted his enemy. “Aha!” said he, “my jockey, you're caged at last. So you thought to wing me, did you? You ought to know that I'm too old to be upset in that way. You always go off half cocked; but, as the Kentuckians say, you're not a priming to me. I'll have the satisfaction of seeing you dance upon nothing any how. Well, well, I'm of a forgiving temper, and after your neck is well stretched I'll cry quits.” With this harangue the speaker placed his arms akimbo, and with an insulting leer at the prisoner, grinned in evident triumph. As the last words fell from his lips, Glenthorne's eyes flashed and his face reddened; and raising his arms, he made a rush at Maddox, designing to fell him with the manacles with which his wrists were confined; but the wary eye of that worthy detected the movement in time to escape the blow. Justly supposing that there might still be danger in too close proximity to such a desperate prisoner, he again took up his position in the rear. Meanwhile the wounded youth was stripped of his coat and vest, when it was found that the bullet had passed through his breast near the region of the heart; and from the fact that but little blood flowed outwardly, it was judged that the internal hemorrhage was proportionably great. As they applied the light to his naked breast, the prisoner rushed forward with the most violent symptoms of agitation; and gazing as if his eyeballs would leap from their sockets at the semblance of an eagle that was imprinted in India ink in the upper part of the shoulder of the sufferer, he exclaimed, in tones of heartrending agony, “My child, my child,” and fell prostrate across his victim. There are periods when the miseries of years appear to concentrate in a single moment of horror; and as the prostrate Glenthorne raised his head from the position it had occupied on the form of the wounded youth, the change that had taken place in his features was absolutely fearful. His ruddy and flushed cheek had assumed an unearthly ghastliness; his eyeballs appeared to have retreated to the very depths of their cavities; his nostrils were compressed like those of one on whom the angel of death had set his seal; and his livid lip and the distorted muscles of his face were terrible witnesses of the giant shock that had shattered every fibre of his frame. If Salvator Rosa could have viewed the group that now presented itself, his master genius would not have been unworthily employed in its delineation. The athletic and muscular frame of the prisoner, his limbs still quivering with the intensity of his agony; the elegant but attenuated form of his female companion, whose sunken eyes were gazing in his face with eager and inquiring solicitude; the wounded youth, whose compressed lips and frequent moans indicated his sufferings; the group of officials, their strongly-marked features partially cast in shadow; the shrinking Maddox, with subdued apprehension still resting on his repulsive countenance; the shivering child, that had quietly crept near the female; and the astonished terrier protruding his head from beneath the bed, where he had retreated on the entrance of the assailants, were the prominent objects that would have glowed upon the canvass. It is unnecessary to detail the events that occurred before the removal of the prisoner. Suffice it to say that the wounded youth was placed on the bed, and that a messenger was despatched for a surgeon to minister to his relief. The female hastily arranged her dress, and with a countenance on which the traces of violent emotions were still visible, prepared to follow her protector to the cells of the watchhouse, whither he was about to be conducted. To this determination both the prisoner Vol. I.—C and the officers urged many objections, but no persuasion could induce her to abandon her purpose. As the party issued from the house, they found that a chilly and drenching rain had succeeded the close of a gloomy day, while the wind, which blew in fitful gusts, rendered the storm peculiarly severe on those who, like the female and child, were clad in light summer dresses. Little, however, did the unfortunate victim of unlicensed passion heed the rude encounter of the elements. The master grief that held possession of her mind permitted no rival, and she therefore moved on in that hopeless misery which admits of neither consolation nor forgetfulness. As they passed through the silent and deserted streets, the thoughts of Glenthorne involuntarily reverted to the period when a youth, with heart bounding with rapture, he first threaded their windings. Rapidly did the prominent events that had marked his career, from that happy state of innocence to the present cheerless moment, pass in review before him, and startling was the groan that issued from the depths of his bosom at the survey. At length the dark outline of a large building, whose subterraneous recesses were occupied for the purposes of a watch-house, was imperfectly defined by the lamplight, and soon the prisoner and his attendants were confronted with the burley form of that autocrat in his own dominions, the captain of the watch. The individual to whom was intrusted this important duty on the present occasion was some fifty years of age, and his corpulent figure, and florid and self-satisfied countenance, attested the perfection to which he had arrived in practically attaining the philosophy of good living. As he occupied the judgment-seat, which was considerably elevated above the floor of the apartment, he threw himself back in his elbow-chair, and, placing his arms akimbo, cast on the prisoner a look which, if it failed to intimidate that individual, was evidently intended by the consequential dignitary as a floorer. “What is this ugly-looking rascal brought in for?” was his first inquiry of the officers. Briefly they informed his worship of the manifold crimes that were laid at the door of the prisoner, and most indignant was that respectable functionary at their enormity. “I knowed the fellow was a scoundrel when I first laid eyes on him,” resumed the captain. “I say, Mr. Jimmerson,” he continued, addressing an individual who was occupied in recording the name and alleged crime of the delinquent, “didn't you hear me call him a villanous-looking rascal when he first comed up? It takes me to know these here chaps. If I get my eyes on 'em, they can't come over me with their nonsense.” To this eulogy on his superior judgment of physiognomy, Mr. Jimmerson responded most fully; but some of the “Charlies” in the background turned up the white of their eyes, twisted their mouths in outlandish shapes, and by other unseem-ly gestures testified their dissent from the verdict in favour of their captain's sagacity. “Tim,” whispered one in the ear of his companion, “the captain twigged the handcuffs; that's what made him so hard on that fellow.” “Ay, ay,” muttered the listener; “between ourselves, he's a devilish old fool. If I couldn't make a better captain out of the maple in our shop, I wish I may be shot.” But why record these mutinous evidences of the perversity of our species? Does not the experience of every day attest the fact that aldermen and assistants, yea, mayors and governors, and even presidents, cannot escape similar aspersions? Nay, did not a wicked editor, but a few days since, publicly state in his columns, that a certain judge therein named should be tried, convicted, and sentenced for murdering the king's English? But, as these reflections are powerless to correct this evil in the body politic, we will return to our history. On proceeding to place Glenthorne in a solitary cell, it was found necessary to remove the female from his neck, to which she clung with convulsive tenacity. After inquiring on what charge she was detained, and learning that she was not implicated, the captain bade her retire; but on her earnest solicitations to be permitted to remain, backed by those of the officers, her request was granted, and she therefore joined the motley ranks of houseless vagrants or benighted wanderers that were scattered on the benches of this reservoir of crime, poverty, and dissipation. As she placed the wearied child on her lap, her fancy depicted scenes of misery in the vista to which those of the past were happiness, and sighs, such as issue alone from the depths of a broken heart, continued audibly to interrupt the silence of her prison-house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. A SUNNY MORNING IN NOVEMBER.—THE ARCANA OF A POLICE COURT.—A CRISIS APPROACHES. “Let us meet, And question this most bloody piece of work, To know it further.” Shakspeare The morning that succeeded the tempestuous night described in our last chapter, was one of uncommon beauty and brilliancy. Not only had all traces of the storm disappeared, but there was a buoyancy in the atmosphere whose exhilarating influence was apparent in all the varied forms of life that thronged the pavé of the great metropolis. Most true is it that the early dawn saluted not with its balmy kiss the cheek of fashion's votary, for over the lids of these favoured children of opulence and gayety the sceptre of Morpheus still waved in triumph. But if to such the volume of Nature, which unfolded the secrets of her loveliest hour, was a C 2 “sealed book,” there were a sufficient number astir to feast the eye of one unaccustomed to the oppressive crowds that almost gorge the leading avenues of New-York during the hours devoted to fashionable promenading. To the sons and daughters of industry, therefore, in default of more dignified worshippers, did Aurora dispense her choicest gifts. The spruce and dapper clerk, with head erect, acknowledged the influence of the hour by a smirk of added assurance and satisfaction; to the merry laugh of the careless apprentice it appended a snatch of some half-remembered ditty; the mechanic, wending his way to his daily employment, paced the street with unwonted vigour; the housemaid, as she brushed the dust from the sidewalk, smiled, and ogled the younger male passengers with eyes sparkling with glee; the milkman aroused the attention of his customers with a more cheerful milk ho! than was his wont; and long, loud, and sonorous did the song of the sweep come wafted on the breeze. The beams of the morning sun had not yet penetrated the streets of the gay city, but the vanes that crowned her lofty spires glittered like golden arrows, and the topmasts of the floating palaces that thronged her quays were gilded with its radiance. From every lane and avenue the pleasant hum of human voices ascended like an anthem to the heavens, to which the heavy and continuous roll of innumerable carriage-wheels formed a not unmeet accompaniment. Although the balmy breath of spring is redolent of pleasure, and comes freighted with the perfume of unnumbered flowers, yet to the hectic cheek of the consumptive hers is the fickle and treacherous smile that fascinates to betray. There lingers in our heart of hearts the memory of one dearer than the lifeblood that courses through the veins, to whose peerless form the embraces of the siren brought the mildew and the worm! But the advent of autumn, with health and contentment beaming in her smile, is ever welcomed with unalloyed delight. Again our footsteps bound over those hills that gave back their echo in boyhood; the many-coloured leaves, that render an American forest in autumn so brilliant, flash and sparkle anew in the sunbeam; the chirp of the squirrel is heard among the branches; the jay, with throat unmusical, cries loudly from her perch; the robin whistles in the hedge, while the harsh scream of the peacock, and the varied cadence of the feathered brood in the barnyard, swell the chorus of nature's melody. Far different were the sensations of the prisoner when the door of his cell opened, and a grim voice bade him follow to the police court. It is the peculiar province of this tribunal to investigate the preliminary proofs that tend to criminate the real or supposed offender against the majesty of the laws, although the benefit of exculpating testimony is not denied the accused. The presence of the magistrates, who, like the Venetian council of three, at the period alluded to composed a full bench in the police court; the gravity and solemnity of manner, and the subdued whispers of the crowd that assembled without the bar, attested the magnitude of the charge on which Glenthorne was arrested, being that of deliberate assassination, to which heinous crime was added the supposed murder of the poor youth who accompanied the officers that apprehended him. Like great men of towns and villages, who experience the nothingness of power when in the presence of the great man of the city or capitol, so the parti-coloured group of offenders who surrounded the prisoner were on this occasion completely merged in the absorbing interest attached to the more important culprit. “My eyes!” whispered an unwashed loafer, who was charged with violating the eighth commandment, to his fellow, “what a devil of a looking sodger he is. If he ain't a rum un, there's no moss-bunkers in the Bear Market. I'll swear that the halter's bought what'll hang him.” “Hush! hush!” said the party addressed, “you don't know what you may come to yourself.” The magistrate who took the lead in the examination was somewhat beyond the middle age; his sinewy frame was cast in a mould of peculiar strength and activity, and the piercing survey to which the prisoner was subjected from the penetrating glance of his dark full eye, afforded slender hope of escape from the proofs that were to be arrayed against him. Having for years occupied a judicial seat at the same tribunal, he had become familiar with all the deceptions and subterfuges to which a wily criminal resorts, in the hope of eluding the vigilance of his judges; and if, in long exploring the darker recesses of the human heart, he had lost somewhat of the sublime attribute that presumes innocence until guilt is established, there was beneath the stern exterior an active benevolence, that ever afforded the panoply of his protection and support to the victim of malicious accusation. The magistrate on his right had probably passed his fiftieth year, and to a tall and commanding person he united a suavity of manner and kindness of heart that went far to temper the more stern justice of his associate. True it is that the oft-convicted offender, who was familiar with the secrets of the police court, rejoiced when, on entering its precincts, he only encountered the calm countenance of the merciful judge; for conclusive indeed must have been the testimony that doomed him to suffer the penalty of his crime. Disposed at all times to tender good advice to the delinquents brought before him, his more prompt associate frequently protested against his occupying the precious moments in lecturing those whose obtuse moral perceptions, he insisted, could only be reached through the medium of bolts and bars. The third dignitary, although considerably younger than either of his associates, appeared more ad vanced in life than was really the case, from the silvery hue that his hair had prematurely assumed. His form was symmetrical, but rather inclining to corpulence, and his countenance grave and dignified. On the minor details of the testimony arrayed against the prisoner, it is needless to dwell. The witness Maddox testified to the murder of a young woman in humble circumstances many months previous, in a distant part of the Union; and although a skilful member of the bar, who volunteered to defend the prisoner, entered into a rigid and searching cross-examination, yet no material discrepance was elicited in the testimony. This witness being dismissed, the surgeon who attended the wounded youth was produced on the stand. The learned gentleman stated that the ball had passed through the breast, and lodged in the back near the spine; and although he had succeeded in its extraction, he yet a pprehended a fatal issue, expressing his conviction that the patient could not survive the day. During all these proceedings the prisoner stood erect, with arms folded, and the occasional convulsive movement of the muscles of his face was the only external evidence that indicated the struggle within. The testimony being closed, Glenthorne was requested to make such statement of the circumstances connected with the charge on which he was arraigned as he might deem important, being first advised by his counsel that he was not required to answer any questions except such as he should think proper. To all queries, however, he refused any reply, stating that he had firmly determined to make no effort to prolong an existence which had long since become burdensome. The only request he made was to be indulged in a few moments' conversation in private with his disconsolate mistress, and the officers were directed to grant them an interview in an apartment adjoining the court-room. After a brief conference, the exclamation “Remember!” was heard in the powerful tones of the prisoner's voice, when the parties re-entered the hall of justice. The magistrates again offered the accused an opportunity of exculpation, which he declined, and impatiently solicited a removal to his prison. “Mr. Haydon,” said the magistrate to a veteran officer, whose prowess and skill in arresting criminals were proverbial, “have the prisoner removed to his cell, and see that he is properly secured. I shall look to you, sir, to ensure his safety.” “I'll answer for his forthcoming with my life,” was the sententious response of the faithful official; when, raising his staff of office and motioning the crowd to give way, this terror of evil doers and his assistants escorted the culprit to his dungeon in the Bridewell prison. The individuals comprising the dense crowd that had collected now slowly departed to their several avocations; and so ephemeral is the influence of the most interesting or absorbing event that occurs in a populous city, that it is doubtful whether this impressive scene occupied the thoughts of one among the thousands that had assembled to behold it, for an hour after its close, if we except the lonely female whose fortunes were so fatally linked with those of the prisoner. To her the world, with all its cares, duties, and pleasures, was hereafter to be a blank; and as she returned to her dwelling, which but yesterday teemed with the endearing associations that cluster round even the most cheerless home, she felt, in all its force, the extent of her destitution and her misery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. THE DÉNOUEMENT OF A TRAGEDY IN REAL LIFE. “A dateless bargain to engrossing death! Come bitter conduct, come unsavoury guide!” “Now boast thee, death! in thy possession lies A lass unparallel'd.” Shakspeare. The favoured individual whose talents are exercised in developing the movements that sway the destinies of states and empires, not only assigns to each actor his appropriate station, and arranges his temporary exits and entrances, but, in the progress of events, a goodly number of his characters are constrained to wave their final adieu to the audience, having been summoned by a mightier power to play their parts on the great theatre of eternity. If such results naturally flow in the current of historical events, it follows that those who imbody the ideal representatives of the matter-of-fact personages that strut and fret their hour on the world's wide stage, may safely continue the parallel; and when the performer has evidently fulfilled his destiny, wrap him in becoming habiliments, and bid him, like immortal Cæsar, “die with decency.” Having now nearly arrived at the first stage of our journey, it behooves us to ponder on the future destiny of those whose advent and progress we have chronicled, meting out to them poetic justice, nor dismissing them from the scene until the immutable laws of nature have enforced their departure. True it is, that while we gaze on the lineaments of some of the children of our own creation with unalloyed pleasure, there are others with whom we are nothing loath to part company; so that the lovely images still flitting in the Eden of our imagination may have “ample room and verge enough” in the future pages of our history. Those who compute time by the events that, like mile-stones, are scattered along its track, will attest that, to the unhappy Glenthorne, the few hours whose flight we have recorded had assumed the importance, and were magnified into the dimensions of Vol. I.—D years; and will, therefore, not partake of the surprise (however their moral feelings may be shocked) that was pictured in the countenances of the vast population of the city when the following paragraph appeared in a newspaper published in the afternoon of the day succeeding that on which the criminal was committed. “Appalling Suicides!—Our readers will scarcely have recovered from the astonishment and horror which pervaded every class of our vast population on the recital of the scenes which led to the apprehension of an individual named Glenthorne, charged with the crime of murder, before their sensibilities are aroused at the fatal dénouement of this tragedy in real life. In addition to the details published in our yesterday's edition, it appears that the youth whose life is in imminent danger from the ball of the assassin was his own child, the fruit of a liaison with a female in this city at a very early period of the prisoner's career. From information which has just reached us, we learn that this miserable criminal has consummated his guilt by the commission of suicide; and that a wretched female with whom he resided has also rushed unbidden into the presence of her Maker. “Early in the afternoon of yesterday, this unhappy fair one, who is described as far superior to her vile associate in every respect, applied to the keeper of the Bridewell prison for permission to convey some provisions to the cell of the criminal; and after instituting a proper search, to prevent the introduction of implements calculated to further his escape, the request was granted. “Nothing farther occurred during the day; and when the keeper of the prison went his nightly rounds, he glanced into the cell of the prisoner, who was reclining on his straw bed. “At the usual hour this morning the keeper again visited the dungeon of the miscreant, and found him stretched on the floor in the agonies of death; and although a physician was immediately summoned, the vital spark had fled before his arrival. By the side of the deceased lay a vial, which had evidently contained laudanum; and a loaf of bread, brought him the previous afternoon, displayed a cavity in which it had undoubtedly been secreted. “But a short time had elapsed after this discovery, when information was conveyed to the police magistrates that the dead body of the female already alluded to was found at her lodgings in the upper part of the city; and by the proceedings of a coroner's inquest, subsequently held on the bodies of both, it appears that the act was premeditated; that they selected the same moment for its execution; and that both consummated their purpose through the agency of laudanum. “The following document, in the handwriting of the female, was found lying on the table in her apartment; and it exhibits not only the unswerving devotion of woman through all the vicissitudes of guilt, penury, and wretchedness, but develops the inevitable fate of the hapless fair one who lavishes the treasure of her love on him in whose breast guilty passions have attained the mastery. “The following is the document referred to: “ `Thursday night. “ `Alas! alas! I tremble at the precipice that yawns before me, and almost shrink from my dread purpose. But why recede? Has not my oath been registered in heaven? Fool that I am to insult the Almighty by reverting to a vow conceived in guilt and uttered in despair! Oh! how vivid the retrospect that pierces the shadows of the past! Strange! that in this awful hour, in which my soul hangs suspended by a hair over the dismal gulf of eternity, the green fields over which I gambolled in the buoyancy of innocence, and the pure embrace of my sainted mother, and the luckless, though too happy hour in which Glenthorne first pressed me to his bosom, should rise up before me to mock me with their departed glories! Gone! gone! gone for ever! Tears! precious tears! Though you scald my eyelids with your bitterness, yet do you show that guilt has not placed an eternal barrier between me and penitence. But away, deceptive cheat! Shall I plunge into the dark abyss with the accents of false hope lingering on my lips? Rather let my thoughts return to thee, Glenthorne. For thee I die content; and though all the world condemn thee, yet doth my heart cling to thee with greater fondness. “ ` “I know not, I care not what guilt's in thy heart, But I know that I love thee, whatever thou art.” “ `How often have I sung thee this ditty, but how little did I anticipate the aptness of the allusion. “ `But see! the index points to the hour of twelve! and dear, dear Glenthorne, I come! I come! The vial is in my hand as it is in thine. “ `Poor, poor child, who will guard thee? Come what will, thou canst not be more miserable than thou wouldst have been with thy wretched protectors— * * * * * * * * “ `The deed is done! Oh mercy! mercy! mercy!' “Thus closed this record of the last throbs of a broken heart, in which conflicting passions struggled so fearfully. Let us draw a veil over her errors, and leave them both in the hands of their Creator. “We learn that the deceased had resided in this city but a few weeks, and that an individual named Maddox, on whose information the murderer was arrested, was the only person who could have shed light on their former history; but, strange to say, he no sooner was apprized of their melancholy end, than he removed his baggage from the house in which he boarded, and, after the most diligent search, we have been unable to ascertain his retreat, or to what circumstance to attribute his sudden disappearance. D 2 “The child thus left an orphan among strangers is a beautiful and interesting boy of about three years of age, and we are pleased to learn that an industrious cartman named Clifton, and his wife, who occupied apartments under the same roof with Glenthorne, have humanely determined to take charge of the little surviver. “From some trinkets found in a bundle by the side of the child, it is conjectured that either the female or her companion, or both, are of a wealthy family, as there are two or three ornaments of great value, which would scarcely have been purchased to decorate an infant, unless the parents were at some period in the possession of abundant worldly means.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. TRANSFORMATION EXTRAORDINARY. “Thus change the forms of being; thus arise Races of living things, glorious in strength, And perish, as the quickening breath of God Fills them or is withdrawn.” Bryant. Years, that stamp their impress on individuals and communities, had swept along since the events narrated in the preceding chapters, causing in their flight more than the ordinary changes incidental to the monuments of human enterprise in the city and its environs. Commodious warehouses, whose dimensions were considered sufficiently ample for the most extensive mercantile transactions, had given place to erections of increased magnitude and elegance; and mansions which the favourites of fortune had exhibited as the ne plus ultra of fashion and splendour, were eclipsed by ranges of princely edifices, in which amplitude and magnificence struggled for mastery. The dense population, whose numbers were a fruitful theme of astonishment to visitants from more circumscribed neighbouring cities and villages, had become swallowed up in the vortex of a mightier crowd, while the vicissitudes attendant on commercial pursuits had stricken the opulent merchant into poverty and obscurity, and elevated the indigent to the apex of wealth and luxury. In that portion of the island known as the remote suburbs, cultivated fields to the extent of thousands of acres, that paid the husbandman a rich harvest for their tillage, now served for the foundation of squares of costly dwellings, and the tillers of the soil were fain to settle down into the character of citizens, or secure the enjoyment of their favourite occupation in more distant localities. The rapid strides that fashion and luxury had made among the wealthier class of citizens were also eminently conspicuous in the splendour and richness of their equipages. In the beautiful street known as Broadway, on a pleasant morning, an immense number of dashing vehicles of all descriptions rattled over the pavement, their exquisitely-polished exteriors flashing back the sunbeams, or with mirror-like fidelity reflecting the forms of the passers-by; the high-mettled steeds curvetting and prancing, with arched necks and flowing manes; the postillions and outriders decorated with gay liveries; and if no coronet crested the armorial bearings that blazoned from their panels, the sigh that agitated the bosom of some fair occupant might serve to attest at least her regret at the absence of the courtly emblem. Over every avenue of literature and science the chariot-wheels of improvement had rolled with irresistible velocity, overturning ancient landmarks in their career, and scattering on either hand new guide-posts to immortality. The antiquated process of fathoming the depths of human character by a long experience of its practical effects on the life and morals, was superseded by an inspection of the inequalities that appeared on the surface of the cranium; while arts, whose labyrinths the student had heretofore occupied years in exploring, through the agency of new-light instructors were rendered obvious even to common intellects in the space of as many hours. But among all the wonders of the day, the perfection that had been attained in the healing art was the most astounding. Practitioners had arisen and were established in every street, whose prescriptions triumphed over the covert or open assaults of disease, in whatever form it exhibited itself; and if death thereafter displayed his sanguinary banner over any portion of the gay multitude, to the incredulity and obstinacy of the victims in not swallowing the pills and boluses was to be attributed the fatal issue of their distemper. If such transformations were visible in the city itself, it is difficult to mark the change that had been wrought in the environs, without subjecting ourselves to the charge of employing the language of hyperbole. Overlooking the twin rivers that, with their islands, encircle the queen of American cities like a girdle of silver studded with emeralds, arose villas and cottages, in which the varied tastes of the proprietors were exhibited in all the combinations of architectural display; and as their ornamented pillars and green verandahs, surrounded with gardens and terraces, in which flowers of every hue rioted in their own fragrance, were first espied in the distance, they perhaps presented a more lively image of the progress of wealth, refinement, and luxury, than even the interior of the vast city, with its masses of humanity scattered over a surface so extended. Opposite the metropolis, on the margin of the East River, stood the city of Brooklyn, almost rivalling its giant neighbour, at the period first alluded to, in population and extent, while on the western shore the city of Jersey exhibited all the characteristics of a bustling and active community. Over the whole surface of the noble bay, from its union with the ocean until its waves rippled along the quays of the great emporium, swarmed the white-winged messengers of commerce, of every form and size, from the majestic merchantship of a thousand tons burden, to the light pleasure-barge that careered over the waters with the speed and buoyancy of a seagull. While the city in its general features was thus rapidly exhibiting the effects of time and change, the lighthearted boy whom we left in the care of the worthy cartman and his helpmate at the conclusion of the previous chapter, had not failed to experience the changes wrought in the lapse of years. Left an orphan among strangers, under circumstances so well calculated to afford but little hope of attaining a respectable station in life, it was peculiarly fortunate that his loneliness and beauty so far enlisted the sympathies of his protectors as to call forth every care and attention that could have been elicited had he been their own. This worthy couple, in early life, had formed a deep and ardent attachment in opposition to the wishes of the parents of the wife, whose station in life was far superior to that of her lover; and, on their marriage becoming public, she was compelled instantly to abandon the home of her childhood, and launch on the wide world with the companion of her choice. Endowed with a mind of much more elevated character than that of her husband, she had insensibly acquired that influence over his actions which is naturally the result of mental superiority; but the kindness of her heart and her mature judgment prevented her from jeoparding her ascendancy by a display of either triumph or assumption. On the contrary, before deciding on any course she invariably consulted the wishes of her partner; and if, at the conclusion of the conference, her views maintained the ascendant, they were so placed as to appear the emanations of his will, and to give her the appearance of the acquiescing party. In this way the affection that had displayed itself in youth increased rather than waned as they proceeded together along the journey of life, excepting when the lack of offspring sometimes gave a melancholy hue to their reflections. Their residence, at the time of their union, was remote from the metropolis; but after struggling some years against the power and influence of the wife's family and connexions, which were ever exerted in opposition to their interests, they decided upon a removal to the commercial emporium, where they had resided but a few months at the commencement of our history. Having been bred to agricultural pursuits, Clifton was prevented from embarking in any mechanical employment; and after due consultation with his helpmate, he purchased a horse and dray, and soon experienced the results that flow from industry, perseverance, and integrity, in the notice and patronage of a wealthy merchant, under whose auspices he not only procured the means of a comfortable livelihood, but commenced the accumulation of a surplus fund that might serve to repel the approach of want in the event of sudden illness, or on the coming of any other unforeseen calamity. During the brief period that elapsed between the entrance of Glenthorne under the same roof and his violent exit, they had noticed with pleasure the interesting appearance of their future protegé, and had not unfrequently amused themselves with his half intelligible prattle; and he had, therefore, entwined himself around their affections before they were themselves aware of the interest he had excited. When the little Sydney (for such was his name) had become the child of their adoption, Mrs. Clifton suggested the propriety of abandoning the patronymic of Glenthorne, and substituting their own in its stead; and as the future happiness of the orphan appeared to be consulted in thus severing the fatal link that united him with a suicide and murderer, the course was no sooner suggested than adopted. Those at all cognizant of the state of society in populous cities need not be informed that the resident in one dwelling is frequently ignorant of the name and occupation of his next-door neighbour; and it will therefore be no subject of surprise, that, in the space of a few years, the interesting little boy was almost universally considered the offspring of Clifton and his amiable consort. Not only had the catastrophe which closed the earthly career of Glenthorne and his mistress long since faded from the recollection of the inhabitants of the gay city, but many crimes of even a darker hue had been perpetrated and forgotten in the more absorbing interest attached to individual enterprise, pleasure, or ambition. As the boy grew in years, his beauty and intelligence made him a general favourite; and the a ptness with which he received instruction, and the modesty with which he exhibited his varied and precocious acquirements, were the daily subject of eulogium by his teachers and their pupils. It is not unusual for schoolboys to form attachments that exercise an important influence on their Vol. I.—E future prospects in life, and Master Sydney reckoned among his intimates two, the dissimilarity of whose characters would have seemed to preclude the possibility of harmonizing, were we not furnished with daily evidences of the little power exerted by incongruities of mind and temper in preventing alliances of friendship and affection. Edward de Lyle, the eldest of these, was the son of the merchant with whom Clifton found employment on his arrival in the city, and who, notwithstanding the dissimilarity of their stations, had conceived for the worthy cartman a warm and abiding friendship. Those who are aware of the facility with which fortunes are frequently realized in the Western hemisphere, and in no portion of its widely-extended surface to a greater extent than in the city of New-York, will readily credit the fact that Mr. de Lyle had commenced business with only the capital saved from the earnings of a clerkship; and when Clifton was first introduced to his notice, he had but reached the threshold of those extensive operations which in a few years swelled his fortune to an amount more than equal to his most sanguine anticipations. On calling, in the course of business, at the dwelling of the cartman, he had been struck with the grace and intelligence of his better half; and although the modesty of the excellent couple induced them to decline the repeated invitations of Mr. de Lyle to visit his family, yet he was their frequent guest, and did not fail to consult them on more than one important occasion. On the unhappy death of Glenthorne and his associate, Mr. de Lyle was made the confidant of their determination to adopt the child; and it was probably by his recommendation that the same teachers who instructed his only son were selected to perform the like service for Sydney; and perhaps a large portion of the friendship that the latter entertained for his playmate, had its origin in the respect and esteem with which he regarded his father. This lad, we regret to say, possessed characteristics widely at variance with those exhibited in the actions of his high-minded parent. During the first flush of worldly success, Mr. de Lyle, whose person was tall and imposing, was introduced to the family of a wealthy and fashionable individual, for whose only daughter, a lively but capricious and spoiled beauty of seventeen, he formed a violent attachment, which was reciprocated with all the ardour that might be expected from the romantic notions of a young girl who had recently emerged from the hotbed of a fashionable boarding-school. As her parents interposed no obstacle to her wishes, she was united to Mr. de Lyle after a three weeks' courtship; and we regret to say that the honeymoon was the only period during which Mr. de Lyle perfectly enjoyed the sweets of connubial felicity. The prominent traits of Mrs. de Lyle's character were imaged in that of her son, who had so far improved on his model as to add great skill in deception to the more frivolous qualities that were imbibed from his maternal parent. The second playmate who enjoyed Sydney's friendship in an unbounded degree, was named Henry Melbourne, and in every important particular was the antipodes of Edward de Lyle. Grave and sedate in his manners, and possessed of a temper whose unruffled surface rarely exhibited the traces of violent emotions, he yet cherished an innate enthusiasm whose flame could alone be kindled by the Promethean spark struck from the same bright source that was its own. Of his mind, perhaps critical acumen might be said to be the leading characteristic; for, with a judgment peculiarly correct and vigorous for a boy, he appeared intuitively to grasp the strong points of a composition, and with a capacity beyond his years would detect the faults displayed either in its general outline or its more minute details. The art of painting, in particular, appeared to possess for him a powerful charm; and it was a study to observe his large blue eye gradually lose its habitual calm expression, until it dilated and flashed with delight before those productions which had graced the easels of the master spirits of antiquity. Regarding truth and honour as the brightest jewels that adorn the human character, his actions corresponded with his professions, and his assertions were ever considered authority, not only by his juvenile companions, but by his more mature acquaintances. He was the only child of a widowed mother, whose husband, a gallant officer of the United States' navy, had died in the service of his country, leaving his widow with a sum barely sufficient for a maintenance and the education of her promising boy. Such were the two schoolmates with whom Sydney passed most of his leisure hours, and in whose joys and sorrows he deeply sympathized. Other lads of nearly his own age, it is true, attracted a portion of his regard, among whom Rembrandt Sinclair, from his talent for dry humour and the piquancy with which he caricatured the little foibles of his companions, was somewhat conspicuous, while for the gay, volatile, and thoughtless Baillie Shafton, who rattled all kinds of nonsense into the ears of the schoolboys, it was at times difficult for him to assign a fitting station in his gallery of intimates. The worthy Clifton and his wife watched with intense anxiety the progress of Sydney in his studies; but the acute perception of Mrs. Clifton detected in his character an impetuosity and enthusiasm which, while they spurned every species of meanness and hypocrisy, made him liable to imbibe crude and imperfect views of the graver moral duties, as well as hasty, and, at times, incorrect estimates of individual character. When, after due reflection, his judgment was required on any subject, it exhibited the highest evidence of force and maturity; but a more cursory review often developed the power that his feelings assumed over its proper exercise. Frank, fearless, and modest, he never permitted E 2 himself to swerve from the truth; and while he rarely differed from his associates on any subject which involved his personal interests, he was always prepared to defend the weak against the strong, and to succour those who invoked his aid without pausing to calculate results. In perfecting the mental exercises which were required from the schoolboys at each half-yearly examination of the academy, he frequently displayed a reach of thought unusual in a lad of his years; and as he entered on that interesting period in which the thoughtlessness of the boy is partially merged in the reflections that are the inevitable concomitants of maturer years, his genius shone forth in the composition of exquisite specimens of poetry, which exhibited the germes of a lofty intellect and brilliant fancy. To his foster mother were fully revealed the lights and shadows of his character, but so adroitly did she temper affection with reproof, and so tenderly approach the most sensitive feelings implanted in his breast, that under her guidance he imperceptibly acquired a mastery over his passions, and rendered them what they should ever be, the auxiliaries, not the sovereigns, of the will. Thus Time the Comforter shed over this little circle his brightest smiles, and while to many he came as the minister of sorrow, to them his progress was thus far fraught with unmingled sources of enjoyment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE MYSTERY UNVEILED.—CHANCES AND CHANGES. “Do I not owe thee all that's worth a name: Treasures of intellect, the wealth of mind? What had I been this moment but for thee? Oh cold will be my heart ere I forget My endless debt of gratitude and love!” N. P. Willis. Although youth has ever been heralded as the season of enjoyment, yet few have attempted to record the items which constitute the full measure of its felicity, and a still less number would peruse such detail with any degree of satisfaction. So rapid are the transformations in the kaleidoscope of youth, that it is a hopeless task to attempt to sketch, with any degree of fidelity, their changeful forms and hues; for, ere the varied tints of one combination are transferred to the canvass, lo! the vision has departed, to be succeeded by other views as beauteous and as evanescent. But while this assertion holds good in relation to the fleeting pleasures of juvenility, the measure of its application is materially changed when we proceed to the investigation of those passions and feelings which, while they are identified with individual enjoyment, exercise a permanent influence over the destiny and after happiness of their possessor. The attempt, indeed, to explore the hidden recesses of human character, and assign to each action its appropriate motive, must be ever ineffectual, unless we can trace the visible effect to its latent cause through all the sinuosities of childhood, youth, and manhood. With our hero the sunny period of youth was rapidly receding; but, as the glittering pageant swept along, it developed the springs that gave activity to his feelings, at times imparting to them an unhealthy impetus, and again retarding their progress by improper obstructions. As we have before remarked, the prominent defects of his mental structure were remedied by the well-directed exertions of Mrs. Clifton; but as perfection is not attainable in this mundane sphere, there were periods when his natural temperament would exhibit its constitutional failings to a limited extent, thus operating as a partial foil to the brightness of his general character. During the earlier portion of his childhood, the anomalous position he held in society was neither understood nor appreciated; but as he advanced in years he began slowly to comprehend that there was something in his history that his foster parents endeavoured to veil in obscurity; nor can it be considered surprising that the desire to unravel the mystery strengthened with his strength. Certain it is that he had frequently alluded to the subject in conversation with his protectors; but Mrs. Clifton did not fail to perceive how destructive would be the sad revelation to his peace of mind, if made before his judgment was sufficiently perfected to operate as a check upon the impetuosity of his feelings. To every inquiry, therefore, she replied evasively, assuring him that there were good reasons to delay the recital, but that he might expect to be made fully acquainted with the facts whenever it was proper for her to detail them. Ardently attached to his more than mother, he was ashamed to continue importunities when he felt satisfied that her resolution was not formed without adequate cause, and he therefore determined not again to introduce the subject until it should be adverted to by Mrs. Clifton. Meanwhile, his progress in his studies was such as to excite the approbation of all who felt an interest in his welfare. In the Latin and French languages he had made great proficiency; but as it was not the intention of Clifton and his wife to give him a strictly classical education, he devoted a large portion of his time to advancement in those studies that were calculated to be beneficial to his future interests. In arithmetic, bookkeeping, and the elements of commercial law, he had become a proficient; nor was he wanting in the more elegant, but less practical, acquirements connected with rhetoric and belles lettres. As his education was rapidly approaching its assigned limit, Clifton solicited Mr. de Lyle to exercise his influence in procuring him a suitable situation in a respectable mercantile establishment; and as Sydney was a great favourite with the distinguished merchant, he at once proposed to assign him a station in his own counting-room. This proposition was gratefully acceded to by all parties, and but a few days were to elapse before it would become necessary for the high-minded boy to sever those youthful associations which had been productive of so much unalloyed happiness. How do we all fondly revert to the same period in our individual history, and how vividly is the parting scene imprinted on the tablet of memory! Arrived, as it were, at the half-way point that divides youth from manhood, we pause in doubt on the threshold, scarcely knowing whether to direct our eyes to the fascinations of the past, or to revel in the hopes that illumine the vista of the future. With such ardent feelings as were possessed by Sydney, the friendships he had formed could not be severed without many a bitter pang; and on the night preceding the day that was to close his connexion with the academy, its teachers, and pupils, he endeavoured in vain to summon oblivion to his aid, and arose in the morning unrefreshed by his customary rest. This was the day appointed for the usual half-yearly examination; and as Sydney was impressed with the importance of closing his academic career with éclat, the composition he delivered succeeded in eliciting the admiration of a numerous auditory, who spontaneously awarded the palm of superiority to the handsome, dark-eyed boy. As may be inferred, his protectors found little interest in the display of youthful rhetoric when their protegé had delivered his essay, and they therefore retired to their dwellings with feelings of honest pride swelling in their breasts at the success of the child of their affection. Not more than two hours had elapsed after their return, when Sydney burst into the room, pale and haggard, and exhibiting the most violent symptoms of mental agony. “Who am I? What am I? Am I, indeed, the child of a murderer? Speak at once, or I shall drop dead at your feet!” exclaimed the agitated boy, as he rushed to the side of Mrs. Clifton and buried his face in her bosom. “Be calm, my son,” said that excellent woman, “and you shall know all.” As the crisis had evidently arrived when longer concealment would be attended with the most calamitous effects, his foster mother informed him of all the circumstances with which the reader is already acquainted. Most conclusively did she demonstrate that, under the operation of our just and equal code of laws, neither rank, fortune, nor character is hereditary; that intelligence and virtue are sure to gain for their possessor the esteem and confidence of the community; and that, with a conscience void of offence, he might pass by the taunts of the malicious and the sneers of the envious as he would the ravings of the idle wind. Thus, mingling the consolations of religion and an elevated philosophy with the exciting details of the narrative, did Mrs. Clifton sooth the irritated feelings of her protegé; and, at the conclusion of the development, he exhibited much less agitation than could have been expected from its gloomy character. From Sydney they learned that the composition of Edward de Lyle was so imperfect, both in structure and language, that the teacher could not refrain from expressing his disappointment and dissatisfaction; and, as he contrasted the faults of Edward's style with the beauties of Sydney's, his reproof excited, in the bosom of the delinquent, the most intense feeling of hatred for his innocent fellow in the unlucky comparison. Burning with rage, therefore, he no sooner left the academy than he commenced abuse of Sydney, whom he stigmatized as a low, base-born wretch, and the son of a foul murderer and assassin, who cheated the gallows by putting an end to his own life. Our hero was almost overwhelmed by the shock of this abrupt development; but, on his bullying assailant repeating the indignity, to which he added the epithet of coward, and contemptuously assaulted him with a kick, the floodgates of his impetuous feelings were thrown down, and, with the fury of a lion, he attacked his insulting vilifier, whom he left stretched on the pavement with but feeble signs of vitality. As Edward was older and much more athletic than his conqueror, the schoolboys universally uttered a shout of triumph at the success of Sydney, who was a general favourite. The well-balanced mind of Mrs. Clifton perceived the necessity of instantly acquainting Mr. de Lyle with the facts, before he should receive them through the distorted medium of Edward's narrative; and Clifton, therefore, at once visited that gentleman, and communicated the details we have furnished to the reader; and on the following morning the worthy protectors of the orphan had the satisfaction of learning that the whole matter was concluded by Edward's penitence for the insult, who was directed by his father to apologize to the injured party. To this Sydney would not consent, but volunteered a reconciliation, and, to all outward appearances, the affray was amicably and finally disposed of. As it is no part of our purpose to anticipate the future progress of our history, we shall refrain from penetrating the secrets of Edward's bosom to ascertain whether his reconciliation with his playmate was the result of his moral convictions, or whether he still harboured sentiments of revenge towards the author of his double discomfiture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I.—F CHAPTER VII. AN INTRODUCTION TO PARTIES WITH WHOM THE READER WILL HEREAFTER BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED.—AN INCIDENT. “Oh bless'd retirement, friend to life's docline, Retreats from cares that never must be mine, How bless'd is he who crowns, in shades like these, A youth of labour with an age of ease.” Goldsmith. “The uncurb'd steeds, their lordly master's pride, Hurl from the bit the foam on either side; With parted nostrils still they scour the plain, Their precious burden summoning aid in vain.” Anonymous. We pass over without comment the lapse of several years, in which no event of moment occurred to ripple the calm surface of our hero's life. The tender regard of his adopted parents increased with the development of his intellectual capacities, which were of a high order; while his aptitude for the mercantile profession, and the strict attention which he gave to the discharge of his duties, rendered him a valuable auxiliary in the counting-room of Mr. de Lyle. Having premised thus much, it becomes necessary to change the scene to the interior of one of those spacious and comfortable, although somewhat antiquated, mansions which were erected by our forefathers in an early period of our country's history. The dwelling referred to was situated in the State of Massachusetts, near the city of Boston, so justly celebrated for the gallantry and patriotism with which its inhabitants resisted the encroachments of arbitrary power on the first dawning of the revolution, and no less renowned for the intelligence and public spirit which have raised it to so commanding a station in the annals of American literature. It was in the afternoon of one of those beautiful winter days in which the usual frown of the ice king is changed to a sunny smile, the more captivating from its rarity, that an elderly lady and gentleman, on whose features the remains of former beauty still lingered, sat by the side of a brisk coal fire, that blazed cheerfully in the well-furnished and brass-mounted grate. The gentleman had not more than reached his fiftieth year, and the lady was somewhat his junior; but the traces of care and anxiety had anticipated the ravages of time, so that a casual observer would have undoubtedly assigned them a more advanced period in life. To a tall and commanding person Mr. Borrowdale (the gentleman now introduced) united bland and courteous manners; but the sudden flash of his dark eye and the haughty curl of his lip evinced an ardent and unconquerable spirit, whose lofty soarings might be curbed, but whose indomitable energies could never be subdued. The lady, on the contrary, displayed a meekness and resignation of the most winning character; but the calm lustre of her full blue eye attested that to the purity of her soul, and not to its stolidity, was her amiable and unresisting deportment to be attributed. The dwelling thus occupied had been erected by a wealthy Boston merchant, while that city was yet in the incipient stage of its commercial history, and was purchased by its present proprietor and occupant many years previous to the period now alluded to. Mr. Borrowdale was a native of an adjoining state, in which he had resided until his removal to his present domicil, where he passed his days in retirement on the income of a large estate. Descended from a noble and aristocratic family in Great Britain, the father of Mr. Borrowdale, who was a younger brother, had early in life become deeply imbued with the principles of democracy; and, in consequence of a rupture that occurred between himself and his relatives, originating in the difference of their political views, he emigrated to America, where he married an amiable and accomplished lady, by whom he had two sons, of whom the gentleman just introduced to the reader was the younger. When the wheels of the revolution first received their impulse, the elder Mr. Borrowdale entered zealously into the views of the colonists, and soon attained the rank of brigadier-general in the continental army, in which he distinguished himself as an intrepid and able officer. At the close of the war he purchased a large tract of land, which increased in value with such rapidity that he found himself in the possession of an ample fortune, and retired to the bosom of his family, where he reposed in quiet until death closed his career of usefulness. Thus his son became possessed in early life of a perfect independence; and all that was known of his subsequent history in the neighbourhood where he resided was limited to the fact, that he came to their vicinity with an amiable and accomplished lady and an interesting little daughter, then an infant, who so far occupied his attention that he seldom made visits to the surrounding gentry. This reserve was at first regarded as the result of pride or misanthropy; but a farther knowledge of the amiable couple removed the impression, and to some unknown source of unhappiness was at length universally ascribed their desire to enjoy the consolations of retirement. Although Mr. Borrowdale and his lady visited only the indigent and afflicted in their neighbourhood, for the purpose of ministering to their necessities, yet, when their kind-hearted neighbours called at their dwelling, they were ever received with melancholy courtesy, and, while they failed to return such visits, they cheerfully permitted their lively and affectionate daughter to cultivate F 2 the intimacy and respond to the calls of her youthful associates. Thus calmly flowed on the current of their lives, until their daughter had attained her sixteenth year, at which epoch we have introduced them to the notice of the reader. “Pomp,” said Mr. Borrowdale to a sable son of Africa, who was brushing the dust from the grate, “run to the door and see if Julia is yet coming. The afternoon is far spent, and I think it time for her to return.” “Yes, massa,” said the well-fed and petted servant; “I go durrecly.” Again wielding the duster, he leisurely arranged the fire-irons to his liking, and stretching himself up to his full height, viz., five feet four, he surveyed the tout ensemble of the fireplace and its appertenances, and appearing to be satisfied with the effect, slowly prepared to do the bidding of his indulgent master. The mansion of Mr. Borrowdale was situated on the brow of an eminence, which overlooked the suburbs of Boston, and the piazza commanded the avenue which led to the city for the distance of nearly two miles. No sooner had the negro reached the piazza, than, uttering a dismal shriek, he rushed into the parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Borrowdale were sitting, and shouted at the top of his voice, “Oh! massa, massa! young missus be kill! oh golly, for why de foolish niggur no go wid young missus; oh golly, golly.” Leaping from their seats in an agony of apprehension, the agitated parents rushed to the piazza, and beheld a scene that might appal the stoutest heart. Climbing the ascent that lay between their position and the city came their span of high-mettled steeds, lashed to their utmost swiftness, and dragging the sleigh, in which sat their daughter, unchecked by rein or driver, their nostrils distended, their eyeballs starting from their sockets, their manes streaming in the wind, their well-defined sinews lacing their symmetrical limbs, and their whole action developing mingled fear and phrensy. Her distracted parents had not reached the piazza when the uncurbed coursers rushed by with the speed of the whirlwind, followed by the dark form of Pomp, whose attempts to arrest them with shouts of “Who! who!” so far from accomplishing the intended purpose, only accelerated their speed, while the sharp ring of their hoofs echoed from their contact with the frozen earth. In the sleigh sat the lovely Miss Borrowdale, pale as a marble statue, her fingers clasping either side of the light vehicle with convulsive tenacity, her chiselled and colourless lips parted by the intensity of her emotions; but over her pallid features shone a calm, holy resignation, which rendered the peril of her situation, if possible, the more vivid and appalling. At the harrowing sight Mrs. Borrowdale swooned, and if her husband had not caught her falling form, she would have been precipitated from the steps of the elevated piazza. Scarcely had the fainting lady been removed to the parlour, before the loud voice of Pomp was heard exclaiming, “Oh massa, massa, young missus safe; she no kill.” And so intent was the affectionate black on communicating the welcome tidings, that he came near overturning his master, who was proceeding for a tumbler of water with which to restore his lady's suspended vitality. The slight concussion caused by Pomp's contact with Mr. Borrowdale was but past, when the sleigh and horses, that had rushed by with such speed, and their fair burden, were driven up to the door by a young gentleman, a stranger to the parties, who had caught the terrified animals at the risk of his life; and, just as Mrs. Borrowdale had recovered from her insensibility, her agitated daughter rushed into her arms. To scenes such as immediately succeeded her entrance, no pen can render justice, and we therefore leave our readers to judge of the rapture of all parties at the unhoped-for rescue of the young lady, without injury, from her perilous situation. After the first burst of joy was past, Mr. Borrowdale turned to the young gentleman to whose gallantry he was indebted for the preservation of his daughter from an awful death, and, grasping both his hands, he could only exclaim, “God bless you, my young friend,” when he was compelled to avert his face to conceal the tears which found their way down his manly cheek. To relieve the agitated family from the embarrassment consequent on the presence of a stranger at such a moment, the young gentleman framed an excuse for leaving the room to attend to the condition of the foaming horses, when the happy family gave full vent to those tender emotions which the events that had just transpired were so well calculated to excite. On the stranger's return to the drawing-room Mr. Borrowdale requested to know the name of his daughter's deliverer, and was informed that it was Sydney Clifton (for it was no other than our hero); but, on being overwhelmed with compliments for his spirit and gallantry, he insisted that the service he had rendered was much overrated, and that, to one possessing ordinary presence of mind, the attempt to arrest the career of runaway horses was unattended with any especial danger. This modest estimate of his activity and courage tended to increase the favourable impression with which Mr. Borrowdale regarded Clifton, who he determined should be his guest at least for the night. This was acceded to by the invited party, but he was obliged first to visit a merchant residing near Mr. Borrowdale, with whom he had a business engagement, and whose dwelling he had but reached when the danger of Miss Borrowdale caused his successful attempt at her rescue. On leaving the house he found his right ankle, which had been sprained in the effort, becoming so painful, that he would be unable to walk for even the limited distance that intervened between the dwellings of Mr. Borrowdale and the Boston merchant. Pomp, however, settled the difficulty by conveying him in the sleigh that still stood at the door. While Sydney was absent, Miss Borrowdale informed her parents that, on her return from the city, the driver was accidentally thrown from his seat at the distance of about two miles from their residence, so that the negro had probably discovered the accident almost at the moment of its occurrence. As Clifton had considerable business to transact with the merchant whom he visited, and who was a correspondent of Mr. de Lyle's, the evening was far spent before his return; and on entering the parlour of Mr. Borrowdale he could no longer conceal the pain caused by his injured limb, which was much swollen and inflamed. Fortunately, Mrs. Borrowdale was sufficiently skilled in the treatment of even more formidable injuries of the like character; and under her directions he retired to a chamber prepared for his reception, and after applying the remedies recommended by his worthy hostess, he retired to his couch, but for a considerable time was unable to rest, not so much in consequence of the sprained limb as from the action of certain novel and undefined sensations in his bosom, with which the bright eyes of Julia Borrowdale were most strangely blended. Tossing from side to side, he endeavoured to woo the influence of the drowsy god, in which he at length succeeded; but even in the shadowy land of dreams the image of the fair girl appeared again in the foreground of the vision, endowed with a host of attractions in addition to those which so thickly clustered around her corporeal presence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “A being of her gentle sex The seeming paragon, To whom the better elements And kindly stars have given A form so fair, that, like the air, 'Tis less of earth than heaven.” A health, by Pinckney. Julia Borrowdale was one of those glorious beings whose image, once imprinted on the memory, continues to brighten and gather lustre amid the wrecks and fragments of a thousand succeeding impressions. It was not that her form or features, either in their graceful outline or their fair proportions, exhibited the perfect symmetry of a faultless model, but it was the living, breathing loveliness that shed its glow over all, etherealizing that which was earthly, and illumining the immortal mind with the radiance of heavenly purity. The beauty of her face was not of that commanding order which exacts homage as its legitimate right, but rather partook of the winning softness which invades the citadel of the heart through its most hidden portals, leading captive the affections ere their silken fetters are perceived. In height she was rather above than below the middle size, with a slight form, whose delicate contour could be fully appreciated only when exhibiting the “poetry of motion.” Her complexion was passing fair; and when her fine blue eyes glowed with the burning thoughts, the full gush of whose thrilling eloquence could alone find utterance through their liquid channels, she appeared rather a truant wanderer from a higher sphere than an erring daughter of frail humanity. Although her mind, like a harmonious lute, gave tone to all the varied emotions of passion and feeling, yet affection and tenderness were the master chords, whose vibrations ever awoke at the slightest touch of sympathy. She possessed in an eminent degree that archness and vivacity which impart so pleasing a zest to the female character, blended at times with a gentle gravity, which, like the transient shadow of a summer cloud, but flitted across the horizon and was lost in the sunshine. Naturally of a yielding and plastic temperament, which bowed to the slightest wish of her respected parents, she yet possessed a fortitude and firmness of purpose which never failed to resist the encroachments of arbitrary power. The cheerful beams of a January sun had penetrated the chamber of this lovely girl ere the spell was dissipated that had locked her senses in oblivion. Like Clifton, she had been unable to compose herself to rest until the night was far spent, but we may attribute this circumstance to the agitating scenes through which she had passed, although anxiety for her deliverer's recovery from the injury he had received in accomplishing her rescue was undoubtedly mingled with more personal considerations. If the duties of her toilet occupied on this occasion more than the time usually assigned them, there was sufficient cause for delay in the exciting nature of the emotions which still lingered and obstructed the calm current of her thoughts. At length the reflection of her faithful mirror was deemed satisfactory, and she descended to the parlour, where Mr. Clifton and her parents were seated, the former with his injured limb reclining on the sofa, which position Mrs. Borrowdale had compelled him to assume, on pain of losing her services as physician in chief. “You see, my dear, that you have our young friend entirely at your mercy,” said Mrs. Borrowdale to her daughter, as she entered the room; “fortunately for his recovery and our enjoyment, I have peremptorily assumed the station of commander-in-chief, and, like all self-constituted despots, I intend to wield the sceptre with a firmness commensurate with the brief period it will remain in my grasp.” “I fear Mr. Clifton will imbibe unfavourable impressions of the depth of our attachment to the doctrine of equal rights,” answered Julia, with vivacity; “one would think that our guest had Vol. I.—G reached a much more Eastern latitude than geography assigns us, from the Asiatic character of our domestic government. The only difference I can perceive in the parallel will be found in the sex of the despot. In the hemisphere alluded to, the gentlemen alone, I believe, exercise supreme authority.” “If I might be permitted to question any opinion advanced by Miss Borrowdale,” followed Clifton, smilingly, “I should assert that the simile holds good even in the particular which she ranks as an exception. In all climes, I believe, the real power is vested in the persons of the ladies. In the East, the fair sovereign executes invisibly what your lady mother has the grace and talent to perform so much more attractively without the necessity of disguise.” “Since Mr. Clifton exhibits so commendable a resignation to the decrees of fate,” replied Mr. Borrowdale, “it is but fair to render his captivity tolerable. So sturdy a rebel against even legitimate authority is the appetite, that I question whether your ranks would not be sensibly diminished by desertion, if, while fasting, the bracing air of a January morning should much longer be permitted to undermine the citadel of your command. But here comes Pomp to announce breakfast, so we will adjourn farther discussion.” The meal despatched, all parties resumed their position in the parlour, and the conversational talent of the members of this amiable family had not for years assumed so lively and pleasing a character as was elicited by the presence of one whose important service they so justly held in grateful appreciation. Mr. Borrowdale, in particular, unlocked the stores of a rich and cultivated intellect, endeavouring, by the introduction of a variety of subjects, to fathom the depths of Clifton's mind, or to bring on the discussion of such themes as would awake a response in the bosom of his guest. While Clifton touched sufficiently on the topics introduced to convince his host that he possessed a rich fund of valuable literary, scientific, and political information, he yet exhibited the pleasing tact of a graceful listener; and the instances were passing rare when an auditor could have drawn forth so complete a development of the varied powers which had so long remained dormant in the breast of Mr. Borrowdale, as the attractive young guest whose atténtion was completely absorbed in the interest excited by his discourse. Those, indeed, who had only known Mr. Borrowdale through the usual intercourse afforded by every-day acquaintance, would have remarked with astonishment the enthusiasm and fervour he displayed while in the company of Clifton; nor would his neighbours have credited the fact, had they been informed of the lofty, and even chivalric, character of his mind. After many subjects had been introduced and their interest exhausted, Mr. Borrowdale alluded to the genius and writings of the authors of America. “I am sure,” he said, “that several of our accomplished writers have attained so enviable a celebrity, that they may safely defy the efforts of envy or rivalry to shake the foundation of their well-earned popularity. Of modern authors, Washington Irving is my model for the perfection of style. Equally free from redundance and obscurity, he combines simplicity with mental power, and possesses the rare merit of presenting a vivid picture to the mind, without distracting the attention from the subject by the introduction of far-fetched metaphors or forced illustrations. His narrative flows on like the placid course of a calm but majestic stream, whose current, although broad and deep, exhibits none of the turbid impetuosity of more shallow rivulets. “The associations connected with the sunny period of youth unquestionably impart a glow to the writings which then constituted the staple of my reading,” continued Mr. Borrowdale; “but while I admit a decided partiality, I should do injustice to the manly and vigorous writers who laid the foundations of our national literature, were I to omit a passing tribute to their talents and worth. “Belknap, the historian of New-Hampshire, deserves commendation, no less for the truth and fidelity of his details, and the industry and research exhibited in their collection, than by the easy flow of his narrative, and his unostentatious, yet clear and comprehensive style. “If he excelled in any one particular, it was in impartiality. You cannot peruse his history without entertaining the conviction that he disdains the practice indulged by many modern authors, of swaying their narratives to suit the prevailing taste of their readers, or to minister to their own prejudices. “Fisher Ames, so justly celebrated for his political essays, has attained a well-earned celebrity in the peculiar path which his genius illuminated. Although ardent and energetic in enforcing his opinions, while his political dissertations abound with impassioned appeals to the judgment and feelings of his readers, his writings exhibit none of that coarseness and virulence which marred the essays of too many of his contemporaries. He possessed, in an eminent degree, an intuitive perception of the impregnable fastnesses which surrounded his own position, while his mental vision was equally keen in detecting the assailable points of his antagonist's defences. Fortified by this prescience, he poured forth a torrent of eloquence, argument, and satire against what he considered errors of principle, while history, reason, and philosophy were marshalled as his chosen allies in the contest.” “Although my knowledge of our early literature,” said Clifton, “is necessarily less perfect than I could desire, yet the little information I possess convinces me of the truth and justice of your general remarks. I would name the journal of Governor John Winthrop, of Massachusetts, written G 2 and published in the early period of the seventeenth century, as a case in point. Although quaint and homely in style, and the narrative at times burdened with uninteresting details, it presents a graphic picture of the state of society, and reveals the moral and political history of that early period, with its lights and shadows exhibited in bold relief. What can be more unique than his story of the battle between the mouse and the snake, with its moral application? Yet, like those of the immortal bard of Avon, his most minute descriptions tend to `hold the mirror up to nature,' and `show the very age and body of the time, his form and pressure.' Through the light imparted by Governor Winthrop's narrative we view the unbending firmness, high moral principle, sturdy independence, and unwavering piety of our emigrant fathers, nor will their bright example be lost on their descendants.” “I rejoice, my young friend,” replied Mr. Borrowdale, “to learn that one so young as yourself has already devoted a portion of his leisure hours to the study of his country's early history. Unfortunately, too many of our young countrymen devote what little attention they bestow on literary pursuits to the perusal of the ephemeral European productions which the American press brings forth in such profusion. The result is, that, if they visit foreign shores, their utter incapacity to impart valuable information connected with their country's literature, history, and institutions, renders them contemptible in the estimation of enlightened foreigners, while the national character suffers in consequence of the superficial specimens of our population thus thrust on their notice. “Doctor Timothy Dwight, of Yale College, is my model for pulpit eloquence,” continued Mr. Borrowdale. “There may be those whose minds have soared on more discursive wing along the firmament of the ideal than Doctor Dwight; but in presenting the true philosophy of religion; in illustrating the beauty of holiness; in spanning, as far as a finite being is capable, the attributes of Deity; in moulding his subject in such fashion that the most illiterate can comprehend, while the profound thinker admires, its beauty and symmetry; in energetic and forcible appeals to the reason and judgement, and in concentrating the essence of his discourse, at its close, in a climax of irresistible strength and clearness, his superiority is manifest. As a lecturer no less than as a divine, Dr. Dwight's claims to distinction are neither few nor equivocal. Possessing a mind of great comprehensiveness and power, he is peculiarly well qualified to unfold the hidden secrets appertaining to the various branches of mental philosophy, and his students and hearers are enlightened by his illustrations, while their hearts are softened and their affections purified by his application of the subject to all the duties and relations of life. It is only in such hands that the science of metaphysics can be beneficially expounded. He whose genius and talents qualify him to analyze the subtile elements which compose our mental structure, but the perversity of whose intellect impels him to wield the weapons of sophistry against the faith of the Christian and the consolations of his religion, is the minister of evil, and fearful must be his reward.” “Is it not surprising,” said Clifton, “that among the many gifted authors of which we can boast, so few have exercised their powers in illustrating the more abstruse sciences?” “Nothing, to my mind, is more natural than such a result,” said Mr. Borrowdale. “The genius of our people is essentially utilitarian. The same talent which in Germany would expend its force in threading the mazes of metaphysical discussion, here displays itself in the invention of labour-saving machinery; or, with far-seeing eye, watches the movements of states and empires, gathering in the scrutiny the experience necessary to the successful prosecution of commercial enterprise. The poet and the novelist, indeed, flourish in our soil, but the reason is sufficiently obvious. A period of repose is needful to the most assiduous; and, while our vast population press forward with alacrity in the race of interest or ambition, they take by the hand him who can charm their leisure hours by the exciting narrativesof poesy or romance.” Thus passed the day, enlivened by the cheerfulness and vivacity of this interesting family. Julia, while listening with much pleasure to the animated conversation of her father and his guest, could not disguise from herself the increasing interest that the tall and handsome young stranger excited in her bosom. While Mr. Borrowdale continued to converse, Sydney was too deeply interested to direct his attention to the ladies; but when that gentleman retired for a time during the afternoon, he made ample amends for his previous abstraction, in dwelling with delight on the beauty and loveliness of Miss Borrowdale. On seeking his chamber, he commenced the analyzation of the emotions that agitated his bosom, and was not a little surprised to find his future happiness so completely identified with the image of the lovely girl. “But why,” he asked himself, “do I foster this passion, whose flame but illumines to destroy? Alas! what am I but a poor wanderer and outcast—the offspring of misfortune and crime— while Julia Borrowdale is the accomplished heiress of a princely fortune. Fool that I am, like a moth to hover around the light that lures me to destruction. But let me fly ere it is too late. Too late did I say? Already the poison pervades every artery of my mental system, and impotent will be my efforts to arrest the progress of the subtle element. If even I could induce the charming girl to listen to my vows, how impossible to secure the assent of her father. The scion of an aristocratic and noble house, it is easy to perceive that ambition is his master passion. Even in his conversation this morning he evinced his sense of superiority; and thinks, by unbending from his dignity and reserve for a day, to requite the obligation his daughter owes me. Having now ascertained the sentiments that burn in my bosom, I will no longer subject myself to the danger that lurks in the presence of the enchantress. To-morrow I will continue to enjoy the sweet delusion, and on the following morning bid a final adieu to happiness and Julia.” With this resolution, based, we must admit, on most unphilosophical and unjust data, Clifton resigned himself to the quiet of his couch. As the day declined, the atmosphere had become thick and gloomy; and when the shadows of evening began to darken the horizon, a severe storm of hail and rain succeeded, which continued to increase until it almost reached the intensity of a hurricane. As the gale swept around the exposed wing of the mansion in which the sleeping apartment of Julia was situated, now expending its wrath in the deep, shrill tones of vengeance, and again displaying its exhausted energies in the faint moanings of despair, her heart first experienced that undefined sadness which ever flings it shadow across the pathway of young Love. On retiring to rest, she but exchanged the theatre of her reflections, without possessing the power to control their wanderings; and long after the midnight chimes of the city bell had mingled with the murmurings of the storm, her solitary lamp shot its ray athwart the gloom, like humble piety amid the moral darkness of a benighted world!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. AN INVOCATION TO CHRISTOPHER NORTH.—AN AMERICAN WINTER'S DAY.—OPPORTUNITIES NEGLECTED. “The crystal drops That trickle down the branches, fast congeal'd, Shoot into pillars of pellucid length, And prop the pile they but adorn'd before.” Cowper. “No—vain, alas! th'endeavour From bonds so sweet to sever; Poor wisdom's chance Against a glance Is now as weak as ever!” Moore. Could we wield thy pen, oh! Christopher North (alas! on whom shall the mantle of thy genius fall when thy earthly casket is despoiled of its jewel?), how would we revel in the splendours that encircled the whereabout of our hero! Verily, our love for thee, Christopher, is passing the love of woman, whether in the evening of thy days thou pourest forth warblings such as were untuned until a nearer glimpse of the bright sphere to which thou art journeying awakened their echoes, or whether, amid the wrecks and fragments of History, thou conjurest up the forms of the mighty dead from the coffin and the shroud, until the aching eyeballs refuse longer to gaze on the glittering array! But hark! to the rushing sound of many waters, and the howlings of the storm spirit, and the creakings of the swayed mast, and the moanings of the parting cordage, and the shouts of distress, and the shrieks of agony, and the death-groan of the shipwrecked: when at the touch of thy wand (goose-quill though it be) the sun bursts from behind the serried clouds, the fisherman pours forth his rude melody, the lulled ocean images headland, cliff, and sky, the herd browse upon the hill, and the low murmur of human voices comes soothingly on the ear. How often have we essayed to track thy meteor-like wanderings, now skirting the horizon, anon hovering in mid air, again shooting upward into the transparent element, until thy unearthly form was lost in the empyrean, and while we were mourning for thee “As one Long loved and for a season gone,” lo! thou wert by our side, lavishing on our stolidity the rich treasures of thy varied lore. On the morning of the day that succeeded the evening last described, the clouds that canopied the heavens with their sable drapery soon broke and scattered, like the routed squadrons of a retreating army, when, gathering like a dark scroll in the zenith, they slowly floated towards the eastern horizon, until their shadowy outline was lost in the cerulean. The rain that deluged the country near the residence of Mr. Borrowdale was succeeded by a severe frost, and the liquid element, congealing around every object on which it fell, presented a most gorgeous and imposing spectacle when the sun burst forth from the clouds that had obscured his lustre. Cutting their crystal shafts upon the sky, the spires and cupolas of the city of Bóston appeared like giant stalactites, that had been hurled from their sparry prisons by some mighty convulsion of nature, while in the opposite direction every hedge, building, tree, and eminence glittered in the panoply of its burnished armour. One sturdy representative of the giant race that formerly peopled the boundless forest, which had successfully resisted the warring elements for centuries, now stretched forth its mailed arms in solitude and majesty from the brow of an adjacent mountain, reminding one of the relic of those puissant warriors, who, arrayed in a like glittering armour, went forth in ancient days to do battle for the Lord of Hosts, and to rescue the holy sepulchre from the sacrilegious grasp of the infidel! During the morning Mr. Borrowdale found it necessary to visit Boston, when Clifton informed him of his intention to leave on the following day for New-York. To this determination both Mr. Borrowdale and his lady made strenuous opposition; but, having stated his resolution, he felt a reluctance to exhibit vacillation of purpose by renouncing it, although, when dwelling on the charms of Julia, he secretly wished that he had been less precipitate in the declaration of his intended Vol. I.—H departure. Soon after, Mrs. Borrowdale desired to be excused while she gave attention to her household duties, and the enraptured Clifton was thus afforded an opportunity to breathe into the ear of his mistress the love that burned in his bosom. His cogitations during the previous night had indeed determined him to adopt this course, if opportunity offered, and now the important moment which would decide his fate was accidentally vouchsafed to him. Perhaps the most mysterious, as well as mischievous deity that ever swayed the destinies of mortals, is the winged god of love. Not content with placing two persons of opposite sexes in juxtaposition for the purpose of causing their mutual embarrassment, he not unfrequently deprives them of the power of uttering the sentiments that, of all others, they most desire to communicate; while, in many instances, he compels them to avow opinions in direct opposition to those they really entertain. Our hero was unfortunately subject to the subtle influence of this tantalizing deity, and his first movement exhibited the desperate condition both of his heart and of his wits. The sofa on which he reclined was opposite the front window of the mansion, and commanded a view of the distant hills, irradiated by their silvery drapery. Near him, on a rich ottoman, sat Miss Borrowdale; and as the silence which ensued after her mother's absence was becoming mutually embarrassing, he essayed to commence the conversation. “I have often thought,” he remarked, “how charming would be a country residence if we could enjoy the smiles of—that is to say, the friends of our youth—that is to say, those to whom we are—” here he paused, and, we must admit, looked particularly silly; but at length concluded by inquiring of Julia if she did not think it was a very fine morning. The quiet smile of his fair auditor was unobserved, for, indeed, he could not assume sufficient courage to look her in the face; but she, although a crimson flush suffused her cheek, was much less disconcerted than her admirer, and soon managed to turn the discourse into a less sentimental channel than that in which Clifton had unsuccessfully attempted to direct it. Although the moments flew with the speed of thought, yet sand after sand dropped successively from the hourglass, and still Sydney was apparently as far from the declaration of his passion as when he first entered the house; and although he watched every turn of the conversation to find an opportunity of introducing the subject, and although hundreds of such had passed, still would his tongue falter in its allegiance until the favoured moment was lost. A friendly piano, which occupied the recess formed by the chimney and angle of the room, was at length espied by Clifton; and conceiving that it might be used as an instrument to attune his heart to a less exciting solo than had been played on it during the morning, he solicited Julia to favour him with a song. As the lovely girl had not learned the fashionable trick of refusing in order to be farther urged, she readily consented, and warbled the following ditty in a voice whose sweetness amply compensated for its limited compass. “They say that ne'er by fortune's gale My hero's brow was fann'd, That round his tall and graceful form No powder'd menials stand: What care I for the glittering dross That lures but to betray? Love claims affection's holier gems To cheer his lonely way! “They tell me that my charmer owns No proud ancestral line, That, sparkling on his manly breast, No courtly emblems shine: Alas, o'er many a courtier's brow Dark falsehood's ensigns wave, And jewels oft have flash'd around Foul passion's palsied slave. “Then cease, the fruitless theme forego, Nor mock my pure desire; Not mine the transient, flickering flame That kindles to expire! Fortune I spurn, her gifts despise; Be mine the blissful lot With him life's ills and joys to share In palace or in cot.” When the song was finished, Clifton complimented Julia in a manner more suited to the lover than he could have previously assumed. “I like the melody passing well,” said he; “it is natural and artless. The sentiments are those of an unsophisticated and virtuous mind, untrammelled by the fetters with which fashion and interest enthral the youthful heart. But I fear they are unsuited to the refined notions of the present enlightened generation. The glare of wealth and the allurements of luxury are too powerful in their attractions to permit such sentiments to bud, blossom, and bear fruit.” “I regret,” replied Julia, gravely, “that one of whose judgment I had formed so exalted an estimate has imbibed impressions so unfavourable to the character of the world around him. Suspicion and distrust of our species, I have been taught to believe, should not be cherished unless the faults imputed are established by the most conclusive testimony. I trust that Mr. Clifton has not formed his opinion by the lights of personal experience.” “Indeed, Miss Borrowdale,” said Clifton, “my decision is not based on any deception the world has practised on myself. Fortunately, my position is too obscure to attract the notice of any but a few devoted friends, so that my personal inexperience, I think, forms no argument against the soundness of my position. My views are rather the result of a scrutiny which, as a `waif on the world's wide common,' I have been enabled to institute into the movements of those by whom I was surrounded. This observation has unhappily led me to adopt the opinion I have expressed.” H 2 “That many of the idle votaries of pleasure in large cities should sport with the purest and holiest affections of the heart,” remarked Julia, “and ridicule that which they have not sufficient soul to comprehend, is not astonishing; but I must insist on your giving the rustics of the country a fair trial before they are included in your sweeping condemnation. When you have ruralized for a year or two among the less polished inhabitants of the remote suburbs, I shall be prepared to be an unwilling convert to your doctrine, if it is still entertained.” “Would that I could adopt your theory in its most extended sense,” returned Clifton. “There is, however, one instance in which the solution of the enigma is most deeply interesting to myself personally. Could I be assured that—” Here the entrance of Mr. Borrowdale unfortunately clipped the thread of his discourse, and compelled him to select a less agitating theme. “How mal-a-propos,” thought he; “a moment more, and the mystery would have been disclosed. It is my destiny; an omen of my final discomfiture.” To add to poor Clifton's melancholy, Mr. Borrowdale's countenance had lost the pleasing expression it had assumed on the previous day; and although he endeavoured to amuse his guest, yet it was evident that his thoughts were far removed from the subjects which he endeavoured to discuss. Mrs. Borrowdale also partook of her husband's sadness, while Julia, silent and pensive, appeared to be lost in revery; but whether her sensations were pleasing or otherwise was a question to which she herself could afford no satisfactory reply. On Clifton's retiring for the night, he pondered deeply on the subject of Mr. Borrowdale's altered demeanour; and, as his natural temperament led him to adopt hasty conclusions, he at once decided that his passion for Julia was discovered, and that her parents' uneasiness was caused by their opposition to so unequal an alliance as would result from her attachment to so humble a suiter. When he arose in the morning he found Julia and her parents in the parlour as he entered, and could with difficulty determine whether to be grieved or gratified at the pallor which overspread her beautiful countenance. “If,” thought he, “I could flatter myself that I caused her lonely vigils, I should for ever bless the hour that brought me to her rescue.” On rising to depart, he was most urgently solicited to revisit the mansion during the summer months, and promised to enjoy that happiness if consistent with his varied engagements. “Unfortunately,” he remarked, with no little sadness in his tone, “my movements are rarely subject to my own volition. If they were, you might live to repent the carte blanche you have given me to quarter on your bounty.” This the host and hostess assured him was impossible; when, with a heart bending beneath the weight of its emotions, he commenced his return to the great commercial city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. A CHARCOAL SKETCH OF SUNDRY INTERESTING COMPAGNONS DU VOYAGE, WHOM IT IS DESIRABLE TO KNOW. “Oh Hero, what a hero thou hadst been, If half thy outward graces had been placed About thy thoughts, and counsels of thy heart.” Much Ado about Nothing. “This fellow picks up wit as pigeons pease; And utters it again when God doth please; He is wit's pedler.” Love's Labour's Lost. If we have for a long period been silent in relation to the movements of Edward de Lyle, our apparent neglect does not arise from any indifference to the fortunes of so important and imposing a personage. As he grew up to manhood, his features displayed a regularity of outline and fitness of proportion which, at the first glance, conveyed the idea of positive beauty; but a more careful survey developed a sinister expression, which the forced smile that he could command at will was little calculated to remove. We know not what sensation is produced in others by the exhibition of a deceptive and hollow-hearted smile, but to us it never fails to conjure up associations connected with Judas the betrayer! A deep view into the arcana of female degradation had produced its usual demoralizing effect, by causing in him a distrust of the virtue and purity of the sex; the character of his mind thus rapidly assimilating itself to that of the polluted individuals whom congeniality of disposition and pursuits had classed among his intimates. As may be supposed, years had deepened the lines of his character insensibly, ripening the errors of boyhood into faults of a less venial description, and transferring youthful vices to the darker catalogue of crimes. During the earlier portion of his dissipated career, his indulgent mother supplied him with sufficient funds to gratify all his desires; but, as the sphere of his operations extended, he found no little difficulty in devising ways and means to liquidate the demands created by his extravagance. After various expedients had been resorted to in the hope of extricating himself from debt and embarrassment, but which continued to plunge him still deeper in their meshes, his introduction to the firm of which his father was the senior partner, at length afforded him a mercantile standing, which enabled him to borrow, at an extravagant rate of interest, sums to cover his immediate necessities. Unhappily for our hero, this pampered child of a weak mother's love had continued from boyhood to cherish against him an antipathy of no common virulence. From the day when Clifton humbled his pride and chastised his insolence, he had continued to devise schemes of revenge, but the even tenour of Sydney's way had hitherto furnished him with no opportunity to execute his malicious purpose. Among the disreputable companions with whom he consorted, Julius Ellingbourne was conspicuous. This individual possessed the most bland and insinuating manners; and as his originally strong mind had received the polish of education and travel, he was an interesting and agreeable companion, and obtained admittance into the society of those who would have spurned the association had they known the dishonourable practices by which his purse was replenished. All that was known of his history, in the circle in which he moved, was that he had but a very few years previous arrived in the city, and that he appeared possessed of ample means to sustain rank in the fashionable world; but of any particulars in relation to his previous career all were equally ignorant. When the subject was alluded to, he would sportively call himself a citizen of the world, and, with mock gravity, argue how totally unimportant it was, whether he was dropped from the clouds in a thunder shower, or some more quiet but no less remarkable freak of nature had caused his advent into this lower world. From thence he would gracefully digress to some other topic, not altogether unconnected with the subject of his remarks, diverging still as he proceeded, until the listener found his attention absorbed in matters entirely foreign to the history of Mr. Ellingbourne. A sternness of demeanour, and a significant allusion to the usual method of settling disputes among gentlemen, served to silence the curiosity of those who pressed such inquiries beyond the rules of courtesy; and, indeed, whatever were his moral defects, cowardice formed no part of his character. The exercise of his talent for keen satire was the sole drawback to his friendly reception at every fireside; for while a large portion of the fashionable world were delighted at his graphic delineation of the foibles or peculiarities of their neighbours, their satisfaction was much less apparent when they learned that their own portraits had been limned with equal fidelity at the opposite side of the town. Another associate who was in the confidence of De Lyle was Piercie Matthison, an original in his way, whose attention to the main chance did not prevent the pursuit of a favourite theory, which he introduced on all occasions, and frequently to the no little annoyance of the coterie of which he was a member. In his opinion, every phenomenon in mind, morals, or ethics was immediately connected with the operations of the stomach; and if the brilliant achievements of the most renowned hero of the age were recounted and appropriately eulogized, Matthison would coolly deduce from them unquestionable evidence of the healthy state of the general's digestive organs; “but,” said he, placing his finger by the side of his prominent nasal organ, “where would his army have been if he had been severely afflicted with the dyspepsy?” As it was impossible to furnish a satisfactory answer to so profound a query, the propounder triumphed by silencing his antagonists. Baillie Shafton, to whom slight allusion has heretofore been made, still retained a portion of his early peculiarities, on which were grafted many novel eccentricities. With sufficient talent to secure for himself, without effort, a respectable rank among the commonplace multitude by whom he was surrounded, he had the egregious folly to affect the man of wit; and although it may not be denied that he occasionally made a decided hit, still the general character of his witticisms was little calculated to increase his reputation among the clever persons of the day. Among the many monstrosities of which he was hourly delivered, the rece of puns constituted the most numerous progeny; and although they were generally of the poorest description, yet the affections of Shafton, like those of other fond parents, gathered intensity in proportion to the helplessness of his mental offspring. The shrewd observer of human character, who was long honoured with Shafton's society, could not fail to recognise in the pun of to-day a marked resemblance to the pun of the preceding day or week; but such coincidences have not unfrequently occurred in the productions of some of the renowned authors of the present time, and cannot, therefore, be safely sneered at. His vices, like his virtues, were rather of a negative character, and he could abandon them with the same facility with which he would cut an old friend whenever more attractive metal was discovered. By a certain description of fashionable ladies he was voted irresistible; for his stock of ideas, like the wares of a retail merchant, were readily accessible, and he certainly was no niggard in their display. If the reader desires a more intimate knowledge of the person of this interesting exclusive, let him or her but seek Broadway on any fine day in spring or autumn, when our favourite will be met on the west side of that attractive thoroughfare, dressed in the quintessence of the mode, equipped with an eyeglass in one hand and a gold-tipped ebony cane in the other; his toes pointed outward; his gray eye, with the aid of the aforesaid glass, peering into the face of every lady he meets; and if a voice should be heard, in tones as soft as those of Caradori Allan, gently murmuring, “Oh! Miss Rose, you look divinely to-day. Pray, how is your angelic sister? Would I could pluck one of those fragrant roses from the parent stem. I'd be in a paradise of sweets. I would, on my honour.” And if this Rosebud should answer, “Oh! fy, how can you be so full of your compliments?” be then satisfied, dear reader, that thou art acquainted with the outward man of Baillie Shafton. As the individuals to whom we here introduce our readers will frequently cross their path during the future progress of this history, we deem it proper to afford a slight description of their most striking peculiarities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I.—I CHAPTER XI. REVERIES AND AMUSEMENTS OF A NEW-YORK BACHELOR. — A PLOT. — FAILURE AT TIMES BETTER THAN SUCCESS. “His manner was, perhaps, the more seductive, Because he ne'er seem'd anxious to seduce; Nothing affected, studied, or constructive Of coxcombry or conquest.” “In play there are two pleasures for your choosing, The one is winning, and the other losing.” Byron. In an apartment in the third story of the fashionable hotel in Broadway, known as the Astor House, reclined on a sofa of the most costly description the form of Julius Ellingbourne. It was late in the afternoon of a beautiful day in early autumn, and as the rich light of two splendid astral lamps mingled with the dying beams of the departing day, they produced that mellow radiance which lends heightened charms to beauty, and steeps the everyday objects of common life in all the witcheries of poetry and romance. The arrangement of the furniture, no less than its elegance, attested the fine taste of the owner; while over the tout ensemble there reigned that apparent absence of all effort at display which forms the ne plus ultra of household adornment. In the centre of the room stood a circular table of superb workmanship and material, on which were negligently scattered a number of choice engravings from the burins of celebrated artists, together with a few richly-bound volumes, comprising the more recent productions of the popular authors of the day. On a mahogany side-table lay a flute, in harmonious proximity to a pair of small swords, which, together with two setts of boxing-gloves, were perhaps the only objects that appeared rather out of place in the otherwise well-ordered apartment. If to the above-mentioned articles we add a bookcase, a pier-glass extending from floor to ceiling, window-curtains of the most beautiful texture and finish, Brussels carpet, and a set of mahogany chairs with ottomans to match, we shall have conveyed a sufficient idea of the appearance of the room. A bachelor, young, spirited, and accomplished, Ellingbourne's talents would, if properly directed, have ensured for their possessor the attainment of an enviable rank among the magnates of the land. That reflections of this character would at times obtrude themselves upon him, is not to be denied; but the energy of will for which he was distinguished enabled him to banish unwelcome thoughts; and haughtily drawing up his form to its full height, he would shield his deviation from the path of honour and rectitude behind that last refuge of the unworthy, the decision that all mankind were innately equally criminal with himself. “In what particular,” would he ask himself, “am I different from the multitude who push their fortunes around me? If, the better to fleece my victims at the gaming-table, I play the hypocrite sufficiently to decoy them into my meshes, I but pursue the like methods with the merchant, the lawyer, or the physician. Nay, for that matter, the ministers of religion, the high-priests of science, and the pretenders to exclusive patriotism, all travel the turnpike of popularity and success by the same description of conveyance that I employ; and if I choose to mount my private vehicle and travel by an obscure by-path instead of thrusting myself in their company, it only exhibits the originality of my views, and should not subject me to the censure of my amiable contemporaries.” Musing somewhat after this sort on the present occasion, he was resting his head on his hand, when a tap at the door served to suspend his reflections. Bidding the visiter enter, the door was opened, and Edward de Lyle appeared, apologizing for the early hour he had selected, by stating that he desired a private conference, and feared that a later period would have found Mr. Ellingbourne otherwise engaged. “My dear fellow, make no apologies,” said the latter, in the tone of superiority with which he usually addressed De Lyle; “you know you are always welcome.” The truth is, that Ellingbourne only tolerated De Lyle from motives of policy, as he could occasionally replenish his exhausted treasury from the funds raised by the latter in his dealings with usurers; while a full knowledge of his meanness and petty duplicity engendered sentiments of contempt, which Ellingbourne would at times exhibit, notwithstanding his desire to keep on fair terms with so convenient an attaché. A little embarrassed at introducing so awkward a subject, De Lyle at length found words to convey his wish that Ellingbourne should form an acquaintance with Sydney Clifton, for the laudable purpose, not only of fleecing him of his hard earnings, but of accomplishing his final ruin by blasting his character, and thus blighting his fair prospects for life. De Lyle could not disguise to himself the probability that, if some scheme was not devised to prevent it, Clifton would soon be offered an interest in the firm of which he was a partner; which would not only thwart his longing for revenge, but, in consequence of Clifton's shrewdness and attention to the minutia of business, would be attended with the more serious consequence of bringing to light the large sums he had clandestinely borrowed to support his extravagance. Placing before Ellingbourne the disastrous results that would follow Clifton's success, and sketching the outline of his character in no attractive colours, he added the promise of a I 2 large sum of money if the scheme succeeded to the extent of his wishes. Like a skilful angler did Ellingbourne manage his associate; now assuming an air of nonchalance, and again appearing to feel a growing interest in his proposal, until, having wrought De Lyle up to the proper state of alarm and excitement, he demanded a most exorbitant reward for his services, which was acceded to, and the matter thus satisfactorily arranged. A theatrical entertainment possessing unusual attraction having been announced for representation within a few nights following that on which this compact was formed, it was selected as an appropriate opportunity to introduce Clifton to the acquaintance of Ellingbourne. Within a few moments after the conclusion of an alliance between these virtuous citizens, Shafton and Matthison were announced, when a game of whist was proposed, and a side-table cleared for action. On drawing for partners, Shafton became associated with Ellingbourne, while De Lyle and Matthison were necessarily their antagonists. When the rubber was nearly concluded, Ellingbourne broke the silence by inquiring languidly, “Pray, Shafton, what are trumps? I'm really too stupid to play to-night. I've somewhat of a headache, and can't, for the soul of me, keep the run of the cards.” “A proof of my theory,” remarked Matthison. “Your stomach is disordered; the head sympathizes, the brain works erratically, and,” throwing down the leading card, which commanded the trick and thereby won the game, “you are minus the rhino. The fact is evident, and the conclusion irresistible.” “Well,” said De Lyle, laughingly, “for once I'm a convert to Matthison's theory. Nothing can be more satisfactory.” The cards temporarily abandoned, two other visiters were introduced by Ellingbourne as Mr. Sipkin and Mr. Thompson, two gentlemen from the country, for whom he entertained the most unbounded regard. The trio were, of course, most happy to be acquainted with Mr. Ellingbourne's particular friends, and made unusual exertions to entertain them. Ellingbourne especially appeared perfectly au fait in every department of agriculture, and not only delighted, but astonished his country visiters by the skill with which he unfolded the mysteries of planting, sowing, and reaping; the most approved method of cultivating turnips, cabbages, and parsnips; to which he added a practical dissertation on the comparative nutritious qualities of the various descriptions of food usually furnished horses, cows, hogs, and other quadrupeds. “My conscience,” whispered Shafton, apart to Matthison, “who'd have thought the fellow had it in him? He is giving those calves the teat to some purpose. They'll bleed beautifully under his regimen; but I'm mistaken if, in the end, they do not find that fair words butter no parsnips.” “His stomach has recovered its tone,” answered Matthison, with the same caution, “and his tongue, unlike his cards, follows suit.” To this Shafton offered a sportive reply, when the by-play came to a pause. Shafton, unlike De Lyle, was not possessed by the Demon of Gaming. Having a handsome income, which he expended solely in the pursuit of pleasure, he occasionally permitted Ellingbourne and Matthison to relieve him of a moderate portion of his spare funds, but rarely hazarded any wager on the result of a game. Perfectly aware of the disreputable means by which this adroit couple gained their living, his moral feelings presented no obstacle to an intimacy so long as they continued to be countenanced by the members of “good society;” but a withdrawal of that passport to his regard would at once have ensured their exclusion from his list of associates. As the perfection of Ellingbourne's policy consisted in supporting the character of a gentleman of easy fortune, it formed no part of his system to rifle the pockets of his victims at his own rooms. Indeed, he rarely took more than the initiatory steps in their undoing, assigning the final measures to other and less skilful hands; and if, as was frequently the case, the plundered party sought redress, no one was apparently more active in effecting the object than Ellingbourne; so that, while originating the scheme by which the victim was fleeced, he still maintained the character of a faithful friend. During the evening, therefore, after the arrival of two additional guests—one of whom, named Dr. Crabbe, was a permanent boarder, and the second, a Mr. Tilford, a transient visiter to the same hotel in which the parties met—cards were indeed introduced at Matthison's especial request; but that worthy and Ellingbourne were so unfortunate as to lose a considerable sum, and the latter sportively remarked, that, since he was a loser, it was no small gratification to have his money won by two such particular friends as Mr. Sipkin and Mr. Thompson. The pair of green horns were delighted at their good luck and their host's liberality, and felicitated themselves not a little on making so valuable an acquaintance. The cards relinquished, supper was introduced, and the whole party proceeded to enjoy the pleasures of the table. Toasts and sentiments being called for, Ellingbourne arose with great gravity, and stated his desire to propose a sentiment, to which he did not doubt all the company would most cordially respond. “I intend,” said he, “to propose the health of a gentleman who has risen by his own merits to an honourable and dignified station in the wealthy and patriotic town in which he resides. Gentlemen, I allude to our worthy guest, Tobias Sipkin, Esq., of Sipkinville, in the County of Connestagona. The confidence reposed in him by the friends of his youth—those who are best acquainted with his merits—attests his talents, virtue, and integrity. Although yet a young man, he possesses the judgment and political acumen of more mature years, with that enthusiastic attachment to the great principles of civil and religious liberty which distinguishes the American people from all others. I will give, gentlemen, the health of To-bias Sipkin, Esquire.” The toast was drank in a bumper, followed by three hearty cheers. The tall, robust, but awkward form of Mr. Sipkin was seen slowly arising at the conclusion of the cheering; and, when finally on his legs, he displayed as grotesque a figure as the most humorous caricaturist could have desired to illustrate. The appearance of his face, in particular, was to the last degree unique. His cheeks were puffed out; his eyes, whose diminutive size contrasted strangely with the stupendous nasal organ over which they peered, were dancing under the influence of the wine he had so liberally swallowed; and his bushy hair, which had long since cut the acquaintance of the scissors, fell like a mop about his ears, the whole forming a combination of features such as it rarely falls to the lot of mortal to possess. As he rose he spread his huge hands on the table, not a little resembling a pair of turtles stripped of their shells; while the uneasy and shuffling movement with which his body swayed to and fro reminded one of an overgrown schoolboy awkwardly delivering a recitation before a large audience. “Mr. President,” he began, “for you're the president of the party, I take it—I rise to answer—” Here he poured out a glass of Champagne and swallowed it hastily. “I say, Mr. President, that I'm much obliged—Mr. President, for your good wishes. I, sir, have a considerable quantity of a sort of kind of popperlaritee in Simp-kin-wille—” Here he filled and emptied another bumper. “Mr. Pres—President, I reckon I beat old Pee—Peter— Pee—e—ter—son — hiccough—sev—seven votes for supe—super—super—wise—ur—hiccough. If that ain't pop—pop—popper—lar—ee—tee, then I don't know what pop—pop—popper—lar—ee— tee is—hiccough. Mr. Elsinscorn, I'll drink your go—good health—hiccough.” “If the booby is up a tree,” said Shafton, “it's a pop'lar tree, any how.” The toast of the country dignitary was, as may be supposed, enthusiastically received, and was followed by one in honour of Mr. Thompson, who wisely returned the compliment by offering “the health of the company.” Doctor Crabbe was then called on for a toast, and, as in duty bound, soon assumed a perpendicular position. “Mr. President,” said the doctor, a fussy little personage of some fifty or sixty years of age, as he contracted his wrinkled brow and drew up his nether lip, which formed two deep canals at the corners of his mouth, “in the present unhappy state of the country, when national and individual ruin stares us in the face, and when the crash that I have for the last thirty years predicted is at our doors, the voice of mirth, I must say, under such circumstances, is most unseemly. Sir, soon, alas! too soon, the wheels of commerce will pause on their axes; the mercantile community and the moneyed institutions will become bankrupt; those of us who do not enter the almshouse will be miserable beggars; and our children—I mean those of us who have children—I, thank Providence, have not yet had the folly to commit matrimony—our children, I say, will starve before our eyes. In view, sir, of the coming calamity, I give as a toast, `Our wretched land: the curses that fell on ancient Egypt are not a tithe of those we are doomed to suffer.' ” “A bumper, a bumper,” said Ellingbourne, “to the doctor's toast, which, I may be permitted to say, is deeply imbued with the spirit of prophecy.” “Doctor,” said Matthison, in a whisper, “are you troubled with the dyspepsy or a sour stomach? I feel interested in knowing.” “Not I; nothing troubles me but the asthma, which clipped the better half of my remarks.” “The Lord be praised!” ejaculated Shafton, in Matthison's ear. “Amen!” said the theorist. De Lyle was now called on for a song, but attempted to excuse himself, when the company shouted unanimously for “a song from Mr. de Lyle.” “Well,” said De Lyle, “afford me time to remember something appropriate, and I will sing. I can't at this moment recall anything but sentimental ditties, which would be as out of place as a dance in a churchyard.” “While De Lyle is rummaging over the store-house of his memory, Shafton, do you relieve the tedium by a pun. Let it be a home thrust,” said Ellingbourne. “If I did as you desire,” replied the punster, “I should transport your better half, which is your body, to that bourne from whence there is no retrograde trav-elling. But the De'il oil me, and put a lighted match to my toes, if I pun any more.” A loud laugh succeeded, and a bumper was swallowed in honour of Shafton's witticism. “Mr. de Lyle,” gruffly remarked Dr. Crabbe, “I trust you will not give us any of the modern songs, which (with all due deference) remind me of the catterwaulings of some forlorn grimalkin. Something rough and homespun is to my taste.” De Lyle replied that he would give them a pair of bacchanalian stanzas, and accordingly sang the following HEALTH. “A health! a health! a fig for wealth While purple wine is flowing: Great Bacchus! we thy glories see Through goblets brightly glowing. What though the rules of monkish fools Forbid our mirth and pleasure; We'll seize the prize, while avarice flies To guard his hoarded treasure. Vol. I.—K SYDNEY CLIFTON. “A health! a health! although by stealth We snatch the bliss before us, Yet still on high joy's banners fly In gilded foldings o'er us. Then fill the cup with rapture up To eyes than planets brighter: If dark distress our hearts oppress, Wine makes the burden lighter.” The song was duly cheered, and was succeeded by toasts, songs, and jests until past midnight, when Thompson trundled Sipkin into a coach and conveyed him to his lodgings. After all the company except Shafton, Matthison, and himself had left, De Lyle insisted on indulging in one rubber of whist, which was assented to, and Shafton was selected as his partner. The game was for a trifling sum, but De Lyle hazarded a wager of a hundred dollars each with Ellingbourne and Matthison on the result. The latter parties were successful, and De Lyle, who was considerably heated with wine, charged the winners with foul play. Ellingbourne instantly, with the greatest coolness, stepped to the door, locked it, and placed the key in his pocket. “Sir,” he said, addressing De Lyle, “you have grossly insulted me in my own person, as well as that of my friend Mr. Matthison, and, by the Heaven above me, you do not leave this room until I have redress. In yonder closet are a pair of duelling-pistols now loaded, and on the side-table are two small-swords. Select your weapon, if the charge you have made is intended for me: if for Matthison, I presume he is capable of defending his own honour.” “If,” said Matthison, sternly, “De Lyle has drank too much wine, and thereby deranged the organs of the stomach, the first act was voluntary, and he is liable for the consequences. If he insinuates that I played foul, either he or myself will be left in this room until taken forth—a corpse.” De Lyle, alarmed into sobriety, declared that he only spoke in jest, and, apologizing satisfactorily, the difficulty ended without bloodshed, and the company withdrew.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. NEW-YORK THEATRICALS.—THE PLOT THICKENS. “Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently.” —Hamlet's Advice to the Players. On an evening subsequent to that of the supper-party, Clifton was reclining on a sofa in the sitting-room of his boarding-house, musing on his visit to Boston, and reverting, with mingled sensations of hope and fear, to the image of the fair girl who, to him, in comparison with all other earthly objects, was “Hyperion to a Satyr.” Since his eyes had rejoiced in the light of that lovely countenance, he had passed his leisure hours in dreamy abstraction, now revelling in the delights of hope, and again sinking to the depths of despair. His reflections were interrupted by the entrance of a servant, who handed him a note, which he opened, and, to his surprise, read the following: “Mr. Edward de Lyle intending to visit the theatre on Tuesday evening next, the 10th instant, on the occasion of Mr. D—'s complimentary benefit, respectfully solicits Mr. Clifton's company. Mr. D. L. will call at Mr. C.'s room at 7 o'clock on that evening, if convenient for him to attend. “No. — St. Mark's Place, Saturday, Oct. 7.” Of the hatred that De Lyle nourished for our hero he was indeed unaware; but their habits, pursuits, and inclinations were natural barriers to an intimacy which it appeared heretofore to have been the policy of both to shun; and this apparently voluntary good-will offering from the son of his friend and patron was to Clifton's mind in the highest degree grateful. Harbouring in his own breast no sinister designs, he was the less inclined to suspect them in another, and therefore, in the morning, despatched a reply, declaring his gratification at the reception of Mr. de Lyle's note, and the pleasure he enjoyed in accepting his invitation. “Fool,” said De Lyle, as he eagerly opened the billet, “he swallows the naked hook. By Heaven, the happy scheme is already half accomplished.” Punctual to the hour, the splendid carriage of Mr. de Lyle was drawn up at the door of Mr. Clifton's boarding-house, and the two young gentlemen were soon on their way to enjoy the evening's amusement. As they approached the theatre, a large number of hacks and private coaches, crowded with gay and joyous beings, thronged the street for a great distance; and as the published regulations rendered it incumbent on the driver of each carriage to deliver his company in turn, nearly half an hour had elapsed from their falling in line before their entrance to Mr. de Lyle's private box. Shortly after they were seated Mr. Ellingbourne entered, and was introduced to Mr. Clifton. In pursuance of their previously arranged scheme, the introduction of our hero to the gambler was by no means marked, for it was deemed most advisable to depend on Ellingbourne's skill and tact, rather than trust to any impression his victim might form through the apparent partiality of De Lyle. An entrance had on this occasion been opened through the centre of the dress circle to the Pit; and that arena, on which critical gladiators had so often blighted the high hopes of dramatic aspirants, was converted into a field on which was marshalled the flashing artillery of ladies' glances. A more select audience had never before graced the interior of an American theatre: and as the K 2 fashionable travelling season was drawing to a close, the dark-eyed daughter of the sunny South, the fair-haired sylph whose home was among the snow-wreathed mountains of the North, and the light-hearted beauty from the flower-clad banks of the “Father of Rivers,” were mingled with the lovely forms that permanently threw their witchery around metropolitan society. “By-the-by, Mr. de Lyle,” said Ellingbourne, “who are those tall and graceful girls occupying the front seat of the opposite box? The one on the right, who appears to be the younger, has a splendid dark eye. See with what eager solicitude she watches the development of the plot. Her whole soul appears absorbed in the interest attached to the performance; and I question if she is conscious of the existence of the brilliant circle of which she forms a part. Oh! what would I not give to divine her thoughts! Innocent and pure they are, I'll be sworn, and, as yet, unclouded by the shadows which even successful love casts over the heart of its victims.” “They are the daughters of Colonel B—, and certainly very fine girls,” replied De Lyle, who excused himself for a brief period, saying that he saw a gentleman in another part of the house with whom he desired a few moments' conversation. “I don't know, Mr. Clifton,” resumed Ellingbourne, “what your sentiments may be, but to me there appears nothing on earth so charming as a young and virtuous female, in whose breast neither guilty passion, nor envy, nor malice, nor uncharitableness, has found entrance. If idolatry were not forbidden, I feel as if I could fall down and worship her.” “That such an object of adoration is more dignified than those of the ancient heathens, is most certain,” replied Clifton. “The image of the deity is at least impressed on the brow of the former.” “You are right, you are undoubtedly right, Mr. Clifton,” said Ellingbourne, with a look of deep abstraction, which, for the time, was unfeigned; for his spirit, that once glowed with aspirations as pure as those which now kindled in the bosom of his auditor, winged its flight to the hour when a mother's love, a sister's kiss, a fair girl's virgin heart, were treasures of his own possession; and a deep sigh attested that “such things were, and were most dear!” The fowler was momentarily ensnared in his own net. The purity of Clifton's feelings had mingled with the turbid current of his; and it was not without an effort that he resumed his confidence and composure. For him, indeed, who debases the unclouded intellect, the eagle spirit, the lofty soul, there is little rest; for the ghosts of his early virtues will for ever haunt him with their spectral images, like that of Banquo, arousing him from the gayety of the banquet, and dashing the jest and the wine-cup together from his lips! The performances of the evening consisted of a mélange of great variety and attraction, being a choice selection from sterling plays, in which the powers of nearly all the most distinguished actors of the day were exhibited to the utmost advantage. Now Melpomene, with stately form and moistened lids, reigned queen of the hour; anon Thalia, with wreathed smiles, usurped the throne, until Momus, a broad grin for his sceptre, supplanted the rival sovereigns in the affections of the audience. As Forrest was displaying his admirable delineation of the jealous Moor, one of the principal actors was at fault, and obliged to resort to the prompter. “How provoking,” said Ellingbourne, “while one is dwelling in mute rapture on the honeyed words of Shakspeare, to have the illusion dissipated in the midst of the most absorbing scene, because some lazy varlet has omitted to study his part. If I were manager, such fellows should be put in Coventry.” “'Tis indeed vexatious,” replied Clifton; “the golden thread that links in sweet communion the thoughts of such a mind as Shakspeare's should not be rudely severed. I frequently repose on my couch after attending the representation of his dramas, and wonder whether, if his equal were to arise in our day, his genius would be appreciated. How often has the lot of those, whose works from age to age have stood like beacons on the watch-towers of literature, illumining the horizon of intellect with their steady effulgence, been cast in poverty and obscurity.” “'Tis too often the fate of genius,” replied Ellingbourne. The first part of the performances being closed, Ellingbourne and Clifton adjourned to the saloon to partake of refreshments. The former, indeed, felt the necessity of some stimulant to relieve his mind from the melancholy which had for the moment enshrouded it. In the saloon they met De Lyle, who introduced Clifton to Dr. Crabbe, Matthison, and Mr. Melville, an English gentleman of fortune who had but recently visited the country. After indulging in due libations to the rosy god, the whole party adjourned to De Lyle's box, where they enjoyed the performance of a lively farce called “Paris and London,” in which Placide enacted the character of Jean Jaques François, giving the portraiture of the volatile Frenchman to the life. “In my opinion,” said Clifton, “Henry Placide is the most natural and impressive performer that the American public have ever known. In quiet, genuine humour, he is unrivalled, and I shall continue to believe that no living actor of any land can, in his line of characters, surpass him.” “Having been in Europe but a few years since, and seen the principal comic performers in London and Paris, I most decidedly concur with you in opinion,” said Ellingbourne. “If,” replied Mr. Melville, “he should visit London, I think I can assure him a most flattering reception. The theatrical audiences of the great metropolis are generally candid critics, and national prejudices will not interfere to prevent a proper appreciation of your able countryman's merits.” “Perceiving,” said Matthison, addressing Mr. Melville, “that you are a gentleman of intelligence, I will take the liberty of handing you my card. My room, sir, is No. — Astor House. I am now procuring information of the peculiar habits, diseases, and pursuits of the men of genius of the present age, and intend, by the result, to test a theory which embraces principles that, sir, I take the liberty of asserting, will at no distant day work a mighty revolution in the Philosophy of Mind and Metaphysics. Sir, here, here,” striking his fore-finger against the pit of his stomach, “is the seat of the emotions, the mainspring of human action, the key that winds up the mental clock, the pendulum, the wheels, the pulleys, the axis; nay, for that matter, even the bell and the hammer. Sir, if you're all right here, go to sleep contented, sir; you're a made man.” Mr. Melville, evidently in doubt of the theorist's sanity, made some unmeaning reply, when Doctor Crabbe observed, “Stuff, stuff, Matthison; take my advice; go home, soak your feet, put a blister on the back of your neck, deplete powerfully, take ten grains of calomel, and in the morning a Seidlitz powder, and I'll warrant a cure of your unhappy monomania, which is very annnoying to your friends.” Mr. Matthison, in great irritation, flew into the lobby, when the company indulged in a hearty laugh. “Doctor,” said De Lyle, “you have offended Matthison highly.” “Why, then, does he continue to bore me with his confounded theory?” At this moment a brilliant burst of patriotism was heard from the lips of one of the actors, when Ellingbourne observed, “In what glowing colours does that master of the human heart depict the true patriot. By heavens, it makes the blood tingle in the veins to listen to the soul-stirring appeal.” “'Tis noble,” replied Doctor Crabbe, “but should have been recited in the days of the Revolution. The audience would then have been worthy of the theme. But to hear it wasted on the degenerate sons of patriotic sires is mockery. Sir, I tell you patriotism is extinct; corruption is at work in the very vitals of the community: we have, sir, a weak and imbecile government, a venal press, a dissipated populace; while in high life there is nothing but deception, and in low nothing but vulgarity.” “Doctor,” said Mr. Melville, who saw at a glance the speaker's true character, “may we not attribute this universal depravity to the operation of your system of government?” “Umph,” replied the doctor, “I don't know that I said we were universally depraved.” “National corruption, individual venality, and the absence of all patriotism conveyed that impression to my mind.” “Damn it, sir,” cried the doctor, in great indignation, “bad as we are, England is the last country to which I would go for improvement. Sir, you place an imbecile old ignoramus on a gilded chair, which you dignify with the name of a throne, and dub him a king, and all of your great men— yes, sir, your most distinguished noblemen, fall down on your knees before him. I'd rather starve, sir, in America, than fare sumptuously in Great Britain, or, sir, in any kingdom of Europe. Sir, kings, lords, commons, princes, and beggars are all going to the devil together.” A quiet smile passed over the countenance of Mr. Melville, who would cheerfully have drawn out a little more of the doctor's extravagance if he had not observed that it interfered with the company's attention to the performance. “But,” said the doctor, who by this time had become mollified, “yonder is my revolutionary friend, General M—n. Although fifteen years my senior, he continues to enjoy high health.” “He deserves every blessing,” replied Clifton; “there is, I believe, not one individual in the city who would not mourn his loss as a public calamity.” “Always excepting,” said Ellingbourne, sneeringly, “the officers of his division, who are praying day and night for his removal from their path to promotion.” “Mr. Ellingbourne,” replied Clifton, gravely, “I regret to hear such words from your lips. Although aware that they are in jest, yet surely patriotism and purity should be exempted from the shafts of satire.” The gambler, who saw he had made a false move, replied with a frankness of bearing that none could more naturally assume. “I stand corrected, Mr. Clifton. The remark was indeed made in badinage; but the subject is of too elevated a character for jest. When you know me better, I fear many as grave an error of omission or commission will claim the exercise of your lenity.” At the close of the entertainment, as Clifton was leaving the theatre in company with Ellingbourne, the name of Miss Borrowdale was pronounced near him, which for a moment fixed him to the spot on which he stood. Recovering himself, he eagerly pushed his way through the crowd, when his eye caught the form of his beloved Julia as she was escorted to her coach in company with a young gentleman and a second lady. The carriage was entered, the door closed, and the fair object of his thoughts rapidly whirled away, before he could succeed in extricating himself from the crowd of beaux and belles that thronged the passages to the theatre. Hastily bidding his party “good-night,” he returned to his boarding-house, and for hours contined to dwell on the charms of Julia; jealousy now suggesting that the male companion was a rival suiter, and hope anon whispering words of comfort and consolation.</field>

There was a round of revelry by night, And Belgium's capital had gathered then Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men; A thousand hearts beat happily; and when Music arose with its voluptuous swell, Soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again, And all went merry as a marriage bell.” Childe Harold. The Soirée to be given on Wednesday evening, —, of October, 18—, by the wealthy and fashionable Mrs. Rainsford, was the great topic of conversation in all the higher circles of the gay city. All the world—which, in the vocabulary of good society, means all the exclusives; for in fashionable life there “Is No world beyond Verona's walls”— were on the qui vive; for as it was the first of the season, so it was expected to eclipse its successors in all the requisites of a brilliant, recherche, and exclusive evening party. Milliners, dress-makers, and artificial florists, were in requisition in every fashionable street, and the beautiful assistants of Mrs. Thompson's emporium in Broadway, declared that their delicate fingers were nearly transformed to the consistency of the marble whose whiteness they emulated, by plying the needle so unremittingly; while their sparkling eyes, that made such fearful havoc among the beaux, were now fairly veiled by weariness in tracing the exquisite proportions of their own tasteful creations. The more respectable hacks were entirely monopolized for the happy occasion; and the unlucky wight who failed to receive Mrs. Rainsford's invitation card, found the circle of his fashionable acquaintances marvellously curtailed of its fair proportions on the following day. The elements of fashionable society are in all countries and at all times essentially the same; modified, indeed, by taste and circumstances, but exhibiting, in all their varied lights and shadows, certain leading characteristics that cannot be mistaken. The talisman at whose touch the gilded portals of its sanctuary are unbarred, has, on the contrary, experienced the ordinary mutations incident to the idols of human ambition. During the age of chivalry, military prowess was the dagon of fashionable idolatry; at a later period, rank and title were invested with the attributes of sovereignty, and were succeeded by the dazzling reign of intellectual eminence, until, at our own day, wealth with golden key has snatched the sceptre from all rivals! Master spirits have indeed arisen at various epochs whose resistless genius has burst the conventional barriers that encircle the empire of fashion, but they must be considered brilliant exceptions to the general rule. We are not among those who believe that the votaries of fashion in the main follow more fleeting or unsubstantial meteors than their fellows; for if we extend our observation to the pursuits which absorb the attention of the majority of all ranks in society, we shall be led to exclaim, “What shadows we are! what shadows we pursue!” Analyze wealth, fame, glory, and decide whether the frivolities of the beau monde are in their essence less legitimate objects of ambition than those beneath the juggernaut wheels of which the mass of mankind prostrate their health, happiness, and energies? Among the favoured individuals whose good fortune had procured them an invitation our hero was numbered. While occupied in the transaction of some business of his employer's at a distance from the city, he accidentally became the travelling companion of Mr. Rainsford, the husband of the fair hostess, who was distinguished for his intelligence and love of literary pursuits, and who conceived so warm an attachment for Clifton, that he desired him thereafter to visit his house at all times, and to consider him as his firm friend. At length the happy evening arrived, and the fashionable precincts of Carroll Place resounded to the clang of horses' hoofs and the deep roll of carriage-wheels. As Clifton entered, he found a brilliant and fashionable assemblage already congregated, while two magnificent pier and the like number of mantel mirrors, flashed back the dazzling light of costly chandeliers, and reproduced the gay pageant with all its array of fair forms, wreathed head-dresses, jewelled zones, waving plumes, and speaking countenances. After tendering his respects to the fair entertainer, a lively and agreeable lady of about thirty years of age, Clifton met De Lyle who was not a little surprised at his procuring an invitation to so exclusive a party. While they were conversing Ellingbourne joined them; and as Clifton's back was momentarily turned towards the door, the former hastily inquired: “De Lyle, who is that beautiful girl now entering? I mean the one with auburn ringlets, who is reclining on the left arm of the small gentleman in blue. I do not recollect of ever having seen her face before, but now I am sure I shall never forget it.” As the words fell from his lips the lady and her company passed; and on turning after saluting Mrs. Rainsford, Clifton recognized his beloved Julia. Their eyes instantly met; and although both were mutually embarrassed, yet in a moment he was at her side, and was introduced by Miss Borrowdale to Miss Elwell, her cousin, and to Mr. Morse. “May I have the pleasure of dancing with Miss Borrowdale if not engaged?” said Clifton. L* “If you dare venture the loss of caste in fashionable life by selecting a partner so little qualified to compete with the city belles, I certainly may not refuse,” replied Julia with a smile. As she accepted the arm of Clifton in exchange for that of Mr. Morse, he espied two vacant seats in a corner of the room rather behind the crowd, and escorted Julia thither. As they seated themselves he said, “Miss Borrowdale, do you know that I recognized you on Monday evening at the theatre; and pardon me, I was so near to you that I almost imagined you had forgotton the countenance of so obscure a person as myself.” Here, in despite of himself, a tear started in his eye, which was not unperceived by his auditor. “Mr. Clifton,” she replied, with an emotion little less visible than his own, “how could you for a moment suppose that I would ever forget one to whom I owe so much? Oh, did you but know how often, very often”—here she paused, and a crimson flush suffused every feature, until it spread over her alabaster neck—“how often,” she continued, recovering her self-possession, “you have been the subject of conversation at our country fire-side, you would not have judged so harshly.” The blush, the pause, the agitation, were not unperceived by Clifton, who trembled with delight. “She loves me; she certainly loves me;” were his thoughts; “and what care I for all the world beside?” As may be imagined, so favourable an opportunity of divulging his passion did not pass unimproved; but although scenes of this description are so thrilling in their effects as to leave their impress on the mind while other emotions have faded in oblivion, yet to a third party the detail would be of questionable interest. Suffice it to state, that before the cotillion was concluded, he had poured into her ear those honeyed words—love's glowing messengers—that, dear and beautiful lady reader, you presume the handsome cavalier at your side will address to you on some delightful evening, with no witnesses but those radiant luminaries which at creation's jubilee sang together for joy: and although the lady blushed and hesitated; declared the hour most untimely for such a revelation; spoke of parents' wishes and filial duty; now chiding and again smiling, yet did the enraptured lover from this interview, feed the torch of hope, which, like a beacon, shed its beams over his solitary way through many an after scene of trial, peril, and despondency. The cotillion was over, the music ceased, and yet, in accents inaudible to any but the fair listener, he continued to reiterate sentiments of affection already a hundred times repeated, until Julia, with woman's delicate instinct, perceived that a longer tête-à-tête would not fail to be remarked; and rising, she said, sportively, “Mr. Clifton, if I do not mistake, a gentleman much resembling yourself, solicited my hand for a cotillion; but now I perceive that one has already passed, and if I do not sue where, as a lady I should command, we shall not be in time for the next.” “Forgive me, Miss Borrowdale,” was the reply; “if in your presence, this goodly company, dance, music, all were forgotten; but I trust, under your sweet guidance, to make amends for my delinquency;” and this apology delivered, he led her to a place in the cotillion. It will be recollected that Ellingbourne pointed out Julia to the notice of De Lyle on her entrance; and from the time that she reclined on Clifton's arm until the close of the evening's amusement, his eyes continued to follow their motions: and perceiving him conducting her to a seat in a secluded corner, he placed himself sufficiently near to observe the blushes which indicated the nature of Clifton's avowal, and the pleasure with which it was received. Deeply enamoured of the grace and beauty of the lovely stranger, the fire of jealousy now mingled with the hate that rankled in his bosom. “Reptile,” he muttered to himself, “your destruction shall hereafter be the object of my thoughts by day, and my dreams by night; for this, every energy I possess shall be taxed to its utmost limit; and if money can compass your ruin, it shall flow like water.” Thus soliloquizing, he observed Clifton and Julia join the dance, and sought his own neglected associates in another part of the room. As he approached a group of ladies, and gentlemen, who were at the moment “lookers on in Vienna,” he heard an acquaintance named Mrs. Tibbs inquiring, “Who can be that young lady in white satin dancing with the tall, dark-eyed young man in black?—though I ought to know all the fashionables, I do not recognize her features.” De Lyle replied, “The lady I have not the pleasure of knowing, but the gentleman is an old acquaintance. He happens to be a clerk whom my father took into our mercantile establishment from motives of charity.” “Did you ever!” said Mrs. Tibbs, tossing her head till the tall plumes with which it was crowned trembled as if a gale had swept over them. “I can't see how poor, vulgar people can put on such airs. How did the upstart get admitted, I wonder?” The lady who thus spoke was the better half of a dealer in pins and needles, who had, by industry and good fortune, become possessed of great wealth; and his help-mate, who was born and brought up in the lowest station of life, could not resist the desire of belonging to good society; and Mr. Rainsford, who respected Mr. Tibbs for the integrity and modesty of his character, had induced his lady to furnish Mrs. and Mr. Tibbs with an invitation, which was accepted most cheerfully by the lady, but declined by the gentleman. Priding herself on her wealth and exclusiveness, she was not a little chagrined at her awkward mistake, and from that moment Clifton was with her a marked man. In height this fair original was precisely five feet three; but her lack of altitude was abundantly compensated by what seamen term “breadth of beam;” and when laced to the extreme of the mode, and elevated in her high heeled shoes, she appeared not unlike a stuffed Lilliputian mounted on stilts. Such rolling of eyeballs and elevating of nasal organs; such rustling of silks and crumpling of satins as followed De Lyle's exposure of the low caste of our hero, were never surpassed; but when the highborn and fashionable Mrs. Melton, the lady of a distinguished senator from a neighbouring state, who was reputed to be the leader of the ton at the seat of government, remarked that she saw no impropriety in associating with any person, however humble his station, whose conduct was reputable, and character above reproach, the shock to Mrs. Tibbs and her coterie was tremendous. “La me,” whispered Mrs. T. to her neighbour, “I do wonder how great folks can so belower themselves.” “But,” resumed Mrs. Melton, “if my eyes do not deceive me, the lady just alluded to is my lovely and accomplished friend, Julia Borrowdale of Boston.” “Oh,” said Shafton, pushing himself forward, “there's no mistake, the name is Borrowdale; I saw the girl was pretty, made my way up to Clifton,— gave him one of my most fascinating bows, and stuck to his side till he gave me an introduction.— Borrowdale is the name, upon my honour.” “What,” said a tall, gaunt, single lady of unmentionable age, “is that the great Boston heiress? Now I see her more distinctly, she is certainly better looking than I first thought, although her face is somewhat childish. But she will improve as she grows older; few ladies have a distingué air until they are advanced beyond girlhood.” At twelve o'clock supper was announced, and the more substantial pleasures of the table temporarily took precedence of the “poetry of motion.” De Lyle had so far matured his plan of operations as to determine on seeking an introduction to Miss Borrowdale during the evening; and while Clifton was escorting her to the sumptuous table prepared in spacious apartments on the second floor of the mansion, he joined them, and was introduced by our hero as the son of his friend and patron. On reaching the table he selected a situation sufficiently near that of the lovers to observe their motions, and occasionally share in a portion of their conversation. Shafton and Ellingbourne procured seats near De Lyle, but still further removed from Clifton. The well-ordered supper was destined to exhibit a further illustration of the mutability of terrestrial objects; the luscious wines travelled with marked celerity to the place appointed for all fermented juices; the wit of the company sparkled in emulation of the champaigne, while the pauses in the conversation, were enlivened by the soft, low melody with which the skilful musicians relieved the tedium of their solitude in the lower apartments. With all the incentives to enjoyment, while at the table, and confronted with the full gaze of hundreds of fashionable roués, neither Julia nor Clifton experienced that flow of spirits which had lent wings to the passing moments in the saloon below. Indeed the most successful suitor will acknowledge that “the course of true love never did run smooth;” and if no realities intervene to mar the happiness of lovers, imagination will summon her shadowy train of obstacles, and however unsubstantial may be the array, they will serve to annoy at least during the silent watches of the night, when deep sleep falls on all—but love struck personages of either sex. As the hour was late, after Julia had informed Clifton that she would be found during her brief stay in the city at the residence of her uncle, Mr. Elwell, she left the party in company with Mr. Morse and her cousin,—and Clifton, who felt no inclination to remain, bowed his adieu to the hostess, and wended his way to his residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. A RIVAL.—A FEMALE TACTICIAN FOILDED. “Notwithstanding all her sudden griefs, The least whereof would quell a lover's hope, Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love The more it grows and fawneth on her still.” “I am so far from granting thy request, That I despise thee for this wrongful suit, And by and by intend to chide myself, Even for the time I spend in talking to thee.” Two Gentlemen of Verona. On the morning following Mrs. Rainsford's soirée, at about 12 o'clock a splendid carriage, with liveried footman and charioteer, drew up at the door of Mr. Elwell's mansion, and Edward de Lyle ascended the door steps and was admitted. “Is Miss Borrowdale at home?” he inquired of the curly-headed waiter, who, after inviting him to a seat in the parlour, took his card, and proceeded to ascertain whether the lady was visible. Soon after her femme de chambre entered the room, and informed Mr. De Lyle, that Miss Borrowdale would do herself the pleasure of waiting on him in a few moments. No sooner had he fixed his bold gaze on the waiting-maid than the thought occurred that she might be made a convenient instrument Vol. I.--M to further his designs. There was a roguish and wicked leer in her sparkling black eye, which, with its over shrewdness of expression, indicated less purity than cunning, and a decided aptitude for intrigue. “My pretty young lady,” he said, “you are Miss Borrowdale's travelling companion, I presume?” “Yes, sir, I took the place of a young woman who was left sick at the springs,” she replied, with a simper. “Do me the favour to step this way,” resumed De Lyle, taking her by the hand and proceeding towards the front window of the parlour; “time is short. Your lady is in danger from the addresses of a person who is totally unworthy of her. But at present you must not whisper a syllable of this to her, as she would not believe it. In a very few days, however, she shall have such evidence as will convince the most sceptical. But, in the mean time, you must be my confidante, my adviser, my charming partner in a few tête-à-têtes.” Here he caught her plump little hand, kissed it, and carelessly placed on the palm a fifty dollar note, saying, “On your life, not a word of this. The safety of Miss Borrowdale alone makes me so bold.” “Sir,” said the girl, “her eyes cast down with affected modesty, “I'm sure if I thought you meant any thing wrong, I would n't touch your present for the world. But come, now, can't you tell me all about it? I should so like to know.” “Meet me at six this afternoon on the walk in front of the Park, and you shall know all. But Miss Borrowdale, will, I fear, surprise us; so, you dear, bewitching little soul, I must bow you out of the room.” Here he ventured to kiss her cheek. “Not a word, but be punctual at six, and I'll do more for you than you dream of.” As she left the room, Miss Borrowdale entered, dressed with great simplicity in a fawn-colored silk gown, a plain diamond broach being the only ornament on her person, if we except a pair of gold earrings; and was saluted by De Lyle with that grace and courtesy for which he was distinguished in “good society.” “I have taken the liberty of calling to inquire if Miss Borrowdale suffered no inconvenience from the evening's exercise,” he said. “For my own part, I ever feel somewhat languid, after a night of pleasure. 'Tis the penalty we all pay for enjoyment.” “My own experience in such matters is so limited,” replied Julia, “that I am not an adequate judge of the effect of fashionable dissipation on the system. Fortunately my seclusion in the country prevents the necessity of reversing the order of nature, by converting night into day. In cities I am aware it is otherwise.” “If I might venture to express an opinion, formed, indeed, somewhat hastily, but which every passing moment confirms, I should decide that any circumstance which prevents Miss Borrowdale from throwing around fashionable society the charm of her presence is most untoward.” Without noticing the intended compliment, Julia at once diverted the subject into another channel, and the quick eye of De Lyle perceived that direct flattery was little calculated to further his wishes. He therefore gracefully introduced various subjects, on which he touched with the superficial fluency and ease of a master of that small talk which forms the current coin of fashionable conversation; and after soliciting permission to again pay his respects, withdrew. “How unlike Clifton,” thought Julia, with a sigh, as he closed the door. In truth, despite his handsome face, and courteous address, neither the countenance nor manner of De Lyle had on the previous evening, left a favourable impression on her mind. Her situation at the supper table at Mrs. Rainsford's had enabled her to hear a considerable portion of his conversation with Ellingbourne and Shafton, which was not only frivolous and unmanly, but in several instances liable to more grave objections; and if she had not supposed the feelings of Clifton would be wounded by any slight towards one whom she considered his friend, the interview on the present occasion would have been most undoubtedly declined. The entrance of Miss Elwell suspended her reflections, whom she addressed: “Cousin Helen, if you are not more attentive to the cavaliers who call to pay their devoirs, I shall certainly eclipse you in their affections. Here have I been this halfhour, doing the amiable to a modern Paris, who intended to throw himself at your feet, but who, in default of the real Helen, was compelled to accept “her counterfeit presentment,” in my poor person. To say truth, the gallant behaved admirably under the circumstances, and most emphatically avowed, as in duty bound, that I was the loadstone which attracted him hither. So, fair coz, be wary, or I shall prove a formidable rival.” “May I be permitted to learn which of the score of swains who are dying at my feet, you have entertained this morning?” inquired Helen. “As the gentleman has been for a good half hour in my company, and is, of course, too deeply enthralled to escape me, I will for once be generous, and relieve your anxiety. He goes by the euphonious cognomen of De Lyle. Confess now that it is as attractive an appellation as one could desire.” “What, the rich, and accomplished, and elegant, and fascinating Edward De Lyle? Why, Julia, your fortune's made. Here have I been these twelve months, trimming my canvass to catch the slightest breeze of his affection without success, when you at first sight sail beautifully before the wind. Coz., I am absolutely jealous, and must dispose of you at once, if I expect to make another conquest this season. You shall marry De Lyle, and be removed from my path.” M.* “But now I think of it, liberty is too attractive, especially as, like other devotees at the shrine of the same goddess, I can, with her signet in my possession, exercise despotic power; and you need not therefore say a word more. I'll not wed,” replied Julia. “But, cousin, without jesting, this would be an excellent match; and, depend on it, De Lyle is not the man to call on you, so pointedly, without a definite purpose. Let me advise you to favour his addresses. His wealth and standing render him a most eligible partner.” “For that very reason, if for no other, I should seriously refuse him. You must know, that I am one of those romantic country girls, who are enamoured with `love in a cottage;' and if a high-born lover should win my affections in the guise of humble mediocrity, and before the knot was tied, the mystery should be unveiled, I would in all probability, consign his suit to the receptacle appointed for `rejected addresses.” “Come, come now, I think I see where the shoe pinches. Has not the tall form of a certain gentleman, who monopolized your attentions last evening, some slight influence on your decision?” At this homethrust, Julia blushingly replied, “Cousin, if you had lived in Connecticut, they certainly would have sacrificed you to their belief in witchcraft. How could you guess so cleverly without the aid of the black art?” “Well, well, cousin,” said Helen, “we'll drop badinage and take an airing. I perceive the coach is at the door, so allons, ma chere ami.” No two things could be more different than the character and feelings of Julia and her cousin. The mind of Helen Elwell was of that shrewd and calculating cast which measures every event by the standard of personal interest; and while she dismissed the conversation relative to the attachment of Julia to Clifton, with a passing remark, yet the real interest she felt in the subject was any thing but slight. Her strong natural sense rendered her indifferent to the attentions of an individual of De Lyle's limited mental capacity, but for our hero she entertained far other sentiments. A young male relative had some months previous, presented her with a few exquisite specimens of Clifton's poetical composition, with which she was particularly pleased, and the same individual had pointed out his person while passing the residence of her father; but her first introduction was furnished by Julia, at Mrs. Rainsford's party. On her return from the soirée she continued to revert to the fascinating expression of his fine intellectual face, and a feeling nearly allied to jealousy agitated her bosom after she had retired to rest, when reflecting on his particular attentions to Julia. That the haughty girl had serious thoughts of an ultimate union with a clerk in a mercantile establishment, is improbable; but the pride of victory, where to conquer, was indeed to triumph, and the desire to compel genius, with its lofty attributes, to lay its homage at her feet, lent an ardour to her feelings, far different, indeed, in its essence, but little less intense than that which glowed in the breast of Julia. Thus fate, which delights in thwarting the wishes of true lovers, was most industriously scattering obstacles in the path of Julia and Clifton; and were we permitted to pierce the veil that curtains the view of futurity, we could furnish thee, gentle reader, an interesting homily on the necessity of patience under trials and afflictions, by recounting the eventful scenes through whose fiery ordeal our hero was destined to pass.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. THE USURER—A CONTRAST. “I'm debating of my present store; And, by the near guess of my memory, I cannot instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats.” “Three months you told me so. Well then your bond.” Merchant of Venice. The history of the Jew in all ages—whether a wanderer beneath the burning sun of the tropics, or performing his pilgrimage in the ice-fettered regions of the north, is associated with images of melancholy interest. Under the despotic governments of the old world, his political and personal rights have ever been the football of tyranny and cupidity; and here, where in the letter and spirit of the constitution he enjoys those privileges which are dispensed with an equal hand to all,—yet bowing beneath the weight of that anathema, which has gone forth against his race, and still reverberates through the earth with fearful distinctness, the lofty spirit that of old swept as with an eagle's wing the realms of literature and science, and with prophetic gaze pierced the arcana of futurity; is now powerless to effect total emancipation from the dominion of national and individual prejudice. For ourselves we deem the lonely descendant of God's chosen people not unworthy the sympathy and admiration of the Christian and the philanthropist. Self-isolated from the multitude that surrounds him—he remains “deaf to the voice of the Christian charmer, charm he never so wisely”—and constant to his faith amid the mutations of centuries, he presents an image of stern and melaneholy grandeur —towering in its pride of place, unshaken by the moral convulsions beneath whose mighty throes the less stable monuments of human will are overthrown. Well are we aware that the holy zeal which sustained his ancestors in the wilderness, has long been quenched—that the genius which poured forth the language of inspiration now wastes its energies upon the details of petty traffick,—that the sublime conceptions of an Isaiah and a Jeremiah no longer glow in the bosoms of their successors. Still over all the halo of former glory sheds its undying lustre, and around the brow of the most insignificant scion of the once noble race, yet lingers the shadow of that beauty whose perfections were concentrated in the features of the Redeemer. It was about noon of the day last alluded to, that an elderly member of the tribe of Judah was sitting with pen in hand, at a low, worm-eaten oaken desk, in a small apartment on the third floor of an antiquated store house, in a portion of the city near Wall street—and of course contiguous to that Rialto of New York known as the “Exchange,” where as of old in Venice the “merchants most do congreate.” A slight wooden railing—on which the accumulated dust of years was suffered to repose in undisturbed quietude—divided the room, serving as a barrier against the intrusion of impertinent curiosity, when the occupant was engaged in inspecting his books and papers—and a rusty lock, the key of which was ever turned on such occasions, closed the narrow gate which alone formed the point of ingress to the sanctum sanctorum of Isaac Samuel. If the eye wandered around this office or counting room, it would fail to discover aught but two or three pine stools, a massive iron chest, and the desk at which the Jew was seated—while the dingy cobwebs that entirely veiled the cornice, and hung in festoons upon the ceiling and along the walls, were the only drapery that relieved the barren nakedness of the apartment. The individual now introduced was a spare, attenuated being, who had nearly numbered three score years, and as—on the entrance of a visitor who was recognized as Edward de Lyle—he arose from his sitting position, and turned toward the door, he presented a striking illustration of the fearful inroads that iron hearted avarice makes upon the frame and spirit of its worshippers. The dark and intelligent but anxious and sunken eye—the dilapidated frame-work of features, which in their fulness were marked by beauty and regularity,—the forehead thickly furrowed with wrinkles, ploughed by the operation of intense thought and care—the form bowed with the weight of accumulated years and anxieties—the tremulous nerves prematurely shattered by continual apprehension of pecuniary loss— were evidences strong as proofs of holy writ, that the inordinate pursuit of gain was forever to prey upon his spirit like the horse leech at the vein “which crieth give—give, but never saith, it is enough.” His dress was composed of a brown frock whose outré cut and threadbare seams attested its antiquity, a pair of pantaloons of the same color and equally venerable for their years—a vest which tradition affirmed to have been originally silk velvet, but which time and hard service had despoiled of its downy surface—a pair of broken lace boots, and a hat whose nap and color had long since been consigned to the “tomb of the Capulets.” As he arose, his thin gray hairs straggling over his furrowed cheek, his long wasted fingers clasping a bundle of folded papers, and the tremulous helplessness of his manner, would have designated him to a stranger as an object on which wealth might worthily bestow a portion of its abundance, rather than the envied possessor of millions in the funds. If, however, such would have been the impression, first conveyed on viewing this singular personage, a few moments observation on the present occasion would have completely dispelled the illusion. No sooner had he recognized by the aid of his spectacles the person of his visitor, than the contrast between him and De Lyle—whose pride not unfrequently bordered on insolence in the presence of his inferiors —was no less striking than incomprehensible to the uninitiated. Depositing his papers in the iron chest, and deliberately unlocking the little gate of his enclosure, he walked up to De Lyle—who tendered him a most obsequious and cringing salutation— and inquired with no little sternness and asperity of manner, “Mr. De Lyle, have you come prepared to pay the note that reached maturity yesterday? My payments this morning are heavy, and I must request its prompt liquidation, as you are aware I have already suffered not a little inconvenience from former delays on your part, and trust that on the present occasion you will be more tenacious of fulfiling your engagement.” “Why, my good friend, I may as well open my budget at once and rely on your kindness, not only for extending the time of payment for the note due yesterday, but also for an additional loan of five thousand dollars. The compensation I intend to allow is most liberal, and before you pronounce a negative, I must beg of you to bear in mind that if I fail to procure the sum I require, it will put me to the most serious inconvenience—nay, I may add that it will subject me to pecuniary loss, and what I value Vol. I.—N infinitely more, will materially impair my mercantile credit.' The piercing dark eye of the usurer dilated to more than its ordinary dimensions as he observed the eager solicitude of the borrower,—and while his gaze was rivetted on De Lyle's countenance, it was several moments before he replied, “Mr. de Lyle, this delinquency is, permit me to say, most unfortunate and discreditable. How do you suppose that my credit would stand in the market, if I should offer the same excuse for failing to fulfil my engagements? Sir, let me tell you, that this renewed request argues either a deficiency of moral rectitude, or the most dangerous pecuniary embarrassment. I shall myself be compelled to borrow to-day at excessive interest to replace the sum I expected from you. Briefly, sir, you shall have the amount you require, on the following terms:—the loan must be made for not less than nine months, at the interest of five per cent. per month—the note of the firm given,—and, to insure the partnership liability, you must purchase from me some article which it is necessary to convert to the especial use of your house. On these conditions, and on no other, will I make the required advance.” “Why, my worthy and excellent friend, surely there can be no doubt of the firm's liability, particularly as no one but ourselves is privy to the transaction. I have not the least objection to pursue any course your superior judgment may point out, but cannot entirely comprehend the necessity of either of us being subjected to the trouble your request imposes; besides in the name of all that is holy, what have you to dispose of that our firm could find use for?” said De Lyle. “Permit me, sir, to judge of the necessity,” said Mr. Samuel, haughtily, “My advances on your personal responsibility have already exceeded the limit which prudence would have dictated. It is, however, my misfortune to be too liberal in my moneyed dealings. I have a splendid time piece lying in my desk, fit for the counting room of any house in the city. You can purchase it, and have it suspended in your mercantile office.” Thus saying, he proceeded to unlock the desk, and produced a common time piece, worth perhaps ten dollars. “This,” he resumed, “is a beautiful article, for which I shall only charge cost. The price is one hundred dollars.” “Oh,” replied the obsequious borrower, “the time-piece is undoubtedly cheap;” but as Mr. Samuel momentarily averted his face, he turned up his eyes in some little astonishment at this exercise of the usurer's cupidity, notwithstanding his previous knowledge of the man. The compact being completed and the note given, they separated; the plundered roué proceeding to the indulgence of his dissipated propensities, and the money-lender hugging himself in the prospect of excessive gain. After De Lyle had retired, this votary of the yellow god carefully inspected the fastenings of his desk and iron chest, and appearing satisfied of their security, closed the office, and commenced his daily visit to that emporium of brokers and stock jobbers, banks and bankers, bulls and bears, called Wall-street. As he elbowed his way through the bustling crowd that during bank hours throngs the pave on either side of the street, his progress was continually arrested by applications from some greedy member of the race of borrowers, seeking temporary relief from the contents of his strong box. “Mr. Samuel, how do you do?” said one. “Have you any spare funds to-day? I'll give you the best security—United States stock at par—one per cent. per month—say the word quick, as I must be off.” The individual who thus addressed him was one of the least needy of the tribe, and having undoubted security, was certain of the loan at some rate. “Why, my good friend,” said Samuel—(borrowers possessing unquestionable securities were always his particular friends) “I can get two per cent. for all my spare funds—poor Blynth is now waiting for a loan at that rate, but as you are my friend, I'll accommodate you on bank stock at one and a half.” “I'll take twenty thousand at one and a quarter.” “One and a half is the lowest I can take,” said the usurer. “Then I must go farther, Mr. Samuel.” “It's yours,” he said in reply, and the matter was thus disposed of. “My dear sir,” said a miserable and agitated applicant, who was on the eve of suspending payment, “I want five thousand to-day, and must have it. I'll give you three per cent. per month, secured by the notes of Smetz &amp; Co., and Dallarymple &amp; Brothers.” “I have no more funds,” replied the money-lender abruptly, when, whispering in the ear of another customer, he said, “Mr. Weller you can have the ten thousand on insurance stocks. I am at my office at half-past two.” Thus slowly moving along did the usurer continue to give audience to the numerous applicants who beset his path. In truth he was somewhat of a monarch in his own sphere, holding his daily levées in Wall street—now cheering the heart of the successful suppliant, and again consigning the unhappy possessor of doubtful securities to the lowest depths of despair. Far different was the conduct of a noble minded moneyed operator, whose office was in Wall-street. Bowing gracefully to his friends on every side, it was his delight to minister to the necessities of the agitated individuals whose credit depended on the procurement of temporary loans; and in every circle the praise of the kind and liberal Mr.— formed the theme of conversation. Long may the sun of prosperity illumine his path, and in the expressive figure of the Eastern diplomate “may the shadow of his happiness never be less.”</field>

A PAIR OF WORTHIES. “His comrade was a sordid soul, Such as does murder for a meed; Who but of fear knows no control Because his conscience, seared and foul, Feels not the import of his deed; One whose brute feeling ne'er aspires Beyond his own mere brute desires. Such tools the tempter ever needs To do the savagest of deeds.” [Scott. The early twilight was gently drawing its veil of gauze over the city on the day before mentioned, as Edward De Lyle might be seen stealthily entering the same obscure Café within whose precincts this history found a commencement. The improvements which had swept like an avalanche over other portions of the metropolis, had passed by this disreputable quarter without a touch; and the only visible transformation was wrought by the hand of time, delapidating those erections which were before bordering on decay, and tinging the more modern dwellings with the rust of years. Within the front apartment, still dedicated to the uses of a tap room, the same individual did not meet the view of De Lyle who had so many years previously ministered to the appetites of Glenthorne and Maddox—for dissipation and remorse had long since consigned his earthly tenement to the place appointed for all living. Another and no less unprepossessing specimen of humanity, was officiating in the like capacity, of whom De Lyle inquired if Thomas Burchard was within. Raising his crimsoned-fringed eyelids he appeared to recognize the person of the querist, whom he directed to the apartment in the rear, where he informed him was the person he sought. “Burchard,” said De Lyle, as he entered the sitting room, “I have a small job for you, and if your conscience was as tender as a chicken's wing, we might fail to come to an understanding. But as, like old soldiers, we have seen some little service together, and you have had no reason to complain of my generosity—why there can be little difficulty in arranging this matter, more particularly as I've had a windfall to-day and feel as rich as Crœsus—and you shall be the first object of my bounty.” Thus saying, he placed his arm on the shoulder of Burchard, with that easy familiarity which a long community of vicious interests had engendered between these two worthies. The individual addressed as Burchard had risen from his seat at De Lyle's entrance; and in the premature look of age, the sallow and wrinkled brow, and the body drawn to the left side by a wound in the breast, the reader would fail to recognize the slender youth who sat at the deal table in the tap room of the same building, when Maddox and Glenthorne entered it together; and who was afterwards consigned to the brink of the grave by the pistol ball of the latter. It was indeed the unfortunate offspring of Glenthorne, whose moral sensibilities— never the most acute—had by the associations which surrounded him, become hardened against the impulses of honour, integrity and sympathy. De Lyle then proceeded to inform him that Clifton—whom he described as a heartless villain, who had by means of fraud fleeced him of large sums at the gaming table, and who was bent on his ruin that he might step in his situation as partner in the firm of which his father was the head, was engaged with several of his vicious associates, to plunder some innocent countrymen, who would on that evening be inveighed into a gaming house in — street, and that to prevent such unprincipled robbery, and at the same time to execute justice on a miscreant who desired his overthrow, he enjoined Burchard to give information to the police magistrates, who would detach a strong posse of the watch and marshals to secure the delinquents in the exercise of their vallainous calling. The hour of ten was suggested, as the proper time to arrest the offenders, and after so describing Clifton's person that Burchard would certainly recognize him, and enjoining the most perfect secrecy, (as to his, De Lyle's,) agency in the matter, he appeared satisfied with his scheme, and gave his accomplice a hundred dollar bill, informing him that it was but an earnest of his future bounty, if the plan succeeded to his wishes. At the first mention of Clifton's name the dull eye of Burchard momentarily lighted up as if some glimmering recollection that the name was familiar to his ear, crossed his mind, but the impression soon appeared to be dissipated, and he continued to listen with his usual stolidity and nonchalance, while the details of the villany he was to commit, were repeated by his artful instructor. And here it may be proper to pause in our narrative, while we give a passing glance at that mysterious inconsistency in the human mind, which shrinks from exposing the depths of its own depravity even to the most reckless and guilty of its associates—but which never fails to frame an excuse for its delinquencies, either in the assumed necessity of the case, or by the employment of some cunningly devised fable. Thus while De Lyle from long experience, and perfectly aware of the avidity with which Burchard would obey his behests, whatever might be the criminality involved in their accomplishment, if the compensation was liberal and the risk to his person not formidable, he still could not introduce the subject without attempting to palliate this nefarious conspiracy, to destroy the character of his victim, by imputing to him those crimes which were daily perpetrated by himself and his accomplices. As may be supposed, Burchard professed his willingness to undertake the task assigned to him, and De Lyle retired from the tavern.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. AN UNWELCOME VISITOR—LOVE'S MISERIES. “Love I him? thus scorned and slighted— Thrown like worthless weed apart— Hopes and feelings seared and blighted— Love him? Yes, with all my heart! With a passion superhuman, Constancy, `Thy name is woman.' “Love nor time, nor mood can fashion— Love? idolatry's the word To speak the broadest, deepest passion, Ever woman's heart hath stirred! Vain to still the mind's desires, Which consume like hidden fires!” Geo. P. Morris. Among the humble dwellings of the more indigent portion of the population, who inhabit a narrow street in an eastern section of the city, one neat, but plain two story cottage, may be observed occupying the centre of a lot—the front of which, during the spring and summer, was formerly decorated with a bed of clover, and skirted by clusters of variegated flowers, whose fragrance and beauty rendered the domicil and its adjuncts not unlike an oasis in the desert, when compared with the dingy dwellings and their unclean appurtenances that surrounded it. On a sunny morning in October, a scantily dressed female might be seen slowly passing through the gravel walk, that led from the street to the front door of the cottage, which, being opened at her knock, she inquired in a feeble but musical voice, if Miss Samuel was at home. The servant answered in the affirmative, and introduced the visitor to the front parlour, whose unostentatious furniture was arranged with that simple and artless propriety which is more attractive in its effect than the most laboured attempt at display. In a few moments a young lady of about eighteen years of age entered, and informed the stranger that she was the person inquired for. The contrast presented by the appearance of the two females was marked in the extreme. The lady known as Miss Samuel was tall and dark eyed, with bold and striking features, cast in the Roman mould of the finest order; and the voluptuous outline of her well-turned limbs, the swelling bust and exquisitely rounded neck and shoulder indicated high health, while the free and lively expression of her handsome countenance attested the absence of all care and anxiety. The visitor on the contrary was originally of a slight frame, which disease or wretchedness had reduced almost to a skeleton;—and her sunken blue eye strangely contrasted with the bright sable orb of her auditor. “Did you desire to speak with me?” said Miss Vol. I.—O Samuel, encouragingly, as she cast a look of pity on the attenuated being before her. “My business is with you, Madam,” replied the party addressed. “I have a communication to make, which I have never found courage to detail until this morning. My physician having informed me that my time on earth is limited, and that recovery is impossible, I have employed the last few hours of a wretched existence in cautioning you to avoid the precipice over which my hopes have been dashed.” “I do not understand the purport of your strange remarks,” said Miss Samuel, with astonishment and displeasure depicted in her countenance; “but if they are of the character that your preface purports, neither my honour nor my dignity will permit their utterance. What precipice can endanger my happiness is more than I can divine. If your further conversation is consistent with that delicacy which should be the polar star of every virtuous female, I am willing to listen. If not, the sooner this conference is closed the better.” Without replying to these remarks, the stranger, after a pause, which appeared necessary to give her strength for a renewal of the conversation, inquired— “Are you not acquainted with a young gentleman calling himself Ernest Stillman? It was of him I wished to speak.” On the name of Stillman being pronounced, Miss Samuel could not conceal her agitation, and with eager solicitude replied—“What can you mean? —What of Mr. Stillman?—inform me at once, I beseech you?” Heaving a sigh, which appeared to proceed from the inmost recesses of her heart, the poor female informed Miss Samuel that the real name of the person referred to was De Lyle; and that, under the same assumed name of Stillman, he had many months previously accomplished her ruin through the agency of a counterfeit marriage, after which he had inhumanly deserted and left her a prey to penury and despair. Long did she mourn his absence, which too confiding love whispered was the result of some cruel necessity, until she accidentally met him in the street, and heard an associate accost him by the name of De Lyle. Overwhelmed with doubt and astonishment, she addressed him by the name of Stillman, but what language could depict her agitation and surprise when he replied with the utmost coolness that she was certainly mistaken in the person, for he had no recollection of ever seeing her before! With great difficulty she tottered to her residence, from which she was soon ejected, in consequence of her inability to pay her board,—since which she had been indebted for subsistence to the charity of a poor but benevolent female who became interested in her sad fate. While performing an errand for her kind-hearted benefactress, she had observed De Lyle enter the residence of Miss Samuel, and repairing to a station at the same hour on several succeeding days, she had, unperceived by him, ascertained the fact of his daily visits. On inquiry she learned that Miss Samuel was a resident of the dwelling he visited, and determined to apprise her of her danger, but felt unequal to the task until the physician's sad annunciation stimulated her resolution, by the certainty that if the revelation was made, it must be attended to without delay. It is difficult to depict the varied expression of Miss Samuel's features during this recital: now doubt appeared the prominent feeling—again apprehension and anxiety were in the ascendant—mortification and wounded pride anon assumed the mastery, and these were succeeded by other but not less painful emotions. Pressing her hand to her forehead, for several moments, after the speaker had ceased, she at length replied, “Madam, I do not doubt that you labour under some strange mistake in relation to the identity of the person of whom you speak. That you have been cruelly deceived by an individual calling himself Stillman I certainly believe, and can readily credit the assertion that he strongly resembles a gentleman of that name who visits this house. Indeed there is little question that the villain to whom you allude is aware of this resemblance, and that the assumption of the name of Mr. Stillman, is the consequence of that knowledge. However, if you will furnish me with your address, I will take such measures to ascertain the facts, as have become necessary to prevent further misapprehension.” “Having performed what I considered a solemn duty, with which no personal considerations are mingled, I, of course, will not reiterate statements which have been already correctly given. My name is Ellen Wilson, and I can be found at No. — Attorney-street. If you should have farther occasion for my aid in this unhappy affair, I feel that the application to be of service must be made soon, for my time on earth is brief.” Thus saying, she arose, and with trembling steps and repressed respiration, left the house. As she closed the door the tears that Miss Samuel had with difficulty suppressed during her stay, burst forth in torrents, and her heart-rending sighs attested the shock which this development had given to her whole system. In the days of youth and innocence, ere we have become hackneyed in the world's deceptiveness, how unnatural and improbable seems the charge of treachery against the object of our love and esteem. True it is that the mind shudders and repels the bare imputation—yet it is startling to the sensibility to think for a moment that he on whom we have lavished the full measure of our confidence, and whose example we have proudly followed, can even in the jaundiced eye of the malicious, or the diseased heart of the envious, be associated with crimes at which the soul recoils! Such were the first sensations of Rachel Samuel on listening to the story of Ellen Wilson, and it was not until the sad, low tones of her voice had long dwelt with painful minuteness, on the enormities of De Lyle, that the Jewess could at all realize the possibility of their truth. “Is this tale indeed true,” she soliloquized—“can it be possible that the rich treasure of my love has been squandered on one who desires but to possess it and then throw it `like a worthless weed away?' It cannot be. I will not believe it. The girl must be labouring under some mental hallucination, or the resemblance of the person of whom she speaks to Mr. Stillman explains the mystery. Oh, that he were here now to dispel my doubts.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. A SKILFUL DISSEMBLER—FARTHER EVIDENCE THAT THE CLOVEN-FOOTED GENTLEMAN IS GOOD TO HIS OWN. “And in his hand a burning heart he bare, Full of vain follies, and newfangleness; For he was false and fraught with fickleness, And learned had to love with secret looks, And well could dance and sing with ruefulness, And fortunes tell, and read in loving books, And thousand other ways to bait his fleshly hooks.” Spenser. Edward de Lyle had from long practice become a thorough adept in the arts of deception. Permitting no moral barrier to interpose between the inception of his guilty desires and their accomplishment, the means by which he deluded his victims were selected with a single view to their efficacy, without pausing to inquire what prospects would be blighted, what hearts broken, what lives jeoparded by their success. Selfishness was the ruling impulse of his nature, to which all other feelings were subservient; and while implacable revenge and licentious indulgence exhibited themselves in bold relief in his career, they were auxiliaries not rivals, to the master passion. His acquaintance with Rachel Samuel, who was the only child of the wealthy Israelite to whom he was so largely indebted, commenced by accidentally observing her while employed in cultivating the flowers which decorated the pleasant little lawn in front of her cottage residence. Struck with the grace and beauty of her person, he affected to have sprained his ancle while passing the house; and leaning against the picket fence which divided the lot from the street, he with a well-counterfeited groan attracted her attention, and the native benevolence of her heart, induced the tender of an invitation to her father's dwelling, where he was desired to recline for a time on the sofa, until the anguish of the sprain was somewhat mitigated. To this request he assented, apologizing for the trouble he was giving his fair entertainer, who, on his being seated, advised the application of spirits of camphor; and while the servant was gone in search of the remedy, he so well improved the opportunity, that on rising to take leave, after enjoying the company of Miss Samuel for half an hour, his request to be permitted to call on the ensuing day, and report the effect of her prescription on his injured limb, met with that faint half-denial which from time immemorial has, in the language of the heart, been translated into tacit approbation. The interview—which occurred several weeks previous to the period alluded to in the preceding chapter—was daily repeated, until the affections of the lovely girl were completely won by the blandishments of the reckless voluptuary. On learning she was the daughter of one who held his destiny, as it were, in the palm of his hand, De Lyle at first shrunk appalled at the danger which would follow a discovery of his schemes; but that desperation which, in the pursuit of guilty enjoyments, causes the coward to rush into difficulties, heedless of consequences, goaded him on from day to day, until he found that to retreat was no less hazardous than to advance. The education and retired habits of the lovely Jewess, increased that fervid enthusiasm which, born of feeling, is fostered by seclusion, while she entertained a romantic and fancy-coloured view of the world around her, that imaged mankind in an ideal mirror, investing the creatures of her mind either with the glowing attributes of the Divinity, or the hideous lineaments of a demon. Isaac Samuel loved his child with an affection as ardent as his grasping nature could conceive for any object; but his cupidity forbade her entertaining female visitors, and the usurer possessed no friends except those who clung to his skirts from stern necessity, and who, of course, never intruded on his notice except at his counting room. Prior to her acquaintance with De Lyle, she occupied a portion of her leisure hours in perusing works of fiction, and in cultivating those flowers which adorned her little enclosure; and although the romance of her nature would occasionally exhibit itself in pensive thought, yet cheerfulness was the prominent feature of her mind; and it was delightful to hear her merry laugh—embodying the soul of glee—while amusing herself with the mischievous pranks of sundry curly-headed juveniles of either sex, who, during her father's stated absence, were her daily visitors. It was during the hours which the usurer devoted to purposes of gain that De Lyle enjoyed the company of the beautiful Miss Samuel; and although he immediately placed in requisition every art that his skill in deception rendered him master of for her ruin, he was met with that high-souled purity and maiden reserve, through whose chaste barrier neither his sophistries nor his blandishments could find entrance. Once or twice, indeed, he ventured to introduce guarded allusions, whose real purport was veiled by artful verbiage; but the suspicious glance and half-indignant blush with which they were received, compelled him to desist from venturing upon such dangerous ground; and as the purity of her soul continued to fan the unholy flame which burned in his bosom, he determined to win by siege what he despaired of carrying by assault. For this purpose he affected the most honourable intentions, at times declaring that he would throw himself at the feet of her father; plead the intensity of his passion, and trust to his magnanimity: and when she depicted the utter ruin to their hopes, which such an avowal would effect, he would shed counterfeit tears, pronounce himself the most wretched of men, and beg of her to advise him as to the proper course to be pursued in so distressing a dilemma. That these agitating scenes disturbed her equanimity is most true; but the native buoyancy of her spirits would soon return, and during his absence she indulged her fancy in depicting the morrow's enjoyment. It was during the day following that on which Mrs. Rainsford's soirée was given, that the scene occurred between Miss Samuel and Ellen Wilson; and the unprecedented absence of De Lyle during whole days, caused by circumstances with which the reader is acquainted, appeared to the poor Jewess to give some countenance to the sad revelation to which she had been an involuntary listener. During this day and the greater part of the succeeding night, her mind was harassed by opposing feelings, alternating between confidence and apprehension, hope and despair. When she arose in the morning, so pallid was her usually ruddy cheek, that her father suggested the propriety of her taking medicine to relieve her coming illness, adding “A stitch in time saves nine.” This she declined, saying that her illness was only a slight headache, which exercise would cure; and as this was the cheaper remedy, of course the suggestion coincided with his views. At the hour which De Lyle usually selected for his daily visits, a rap was heard at the door, and he came bounding into the room. “Ha, my charmer!” he exclaimed, in a gay and joyous tone, “I suppose you are prepared to read me a good lecture for my yesterday's absence. Begin at once, then, dearest, and I will make such an excellent excuse, that you will pardon me, and, as in duty bound, I shall fall on my knees and kiss that dear little hand until you are fairly wearied. But I can't wait, absolutely I can't; I must tell you: my old curmudgeon of an uncle for once chose to entrust me with an important mission, and in consequence of my succeeding to his wishes, he presented me with a hundred dollar bill; and now what shall I purchase,—what rare gem of nature or art, to bestow on my dear, dear Rachel?” As the blinds were drawn to exclude the rays of the sun, he did not observe the paleness of her features, and was not a little startled at the hollow and sad voice in which she replied: “Oh, Mr. Stillman, I yesterday was told such a tale concerning you, that I can hardly find courage to repeat it. Indeed, indeed, I am a most unhappy and disconsolate being, and shall never trust mortal more if you are false. Do you know a young woman, named Ellen Wilson?” At this name the colour of De Lyle's cheek came and went; but fortunately for him, the same cause which had prevented him from noticing her agitation, now performed the like friendly office in his case; and reflecting for a moment, he said, “Why, in the name of all the gods at once, what does this mean? I see how it is; you are still determined to pay me off for yesterday's delinquency, by frightening me out of my seven senses. However, I'll gravely answer your question. I do not know any female bearing the name you mention. And now, if this is really no joke, let me have the whole story at once, verbatim et literatim, et punctuatim, and I'll listen attentively from alpha to omega.” “Mr. Stillman, this is certainly a most serious charge, and one which, if true, involves so desperate a departure from the paths of virtue, that I must confess I cannot credit it.” “There spoke my pure dear girl; blessings on you for those words. I knew you could not deem me other than I seem. The only guilt with which I can charge my conscience, consists in linking so bright a being as yourself to my hopeless fate. Alas! what am I but a poor dependant orphan, without resources or fortune even in prospect, except on the death of one who may live as long as myself? But it shall not be; I will at once sever a tie which must at last make you wretched, and perhaps it is fortunate that my character has been slandered. If but a suspicion, even the shadow of a suspicion, remains on your mind in relation to the purity Vol. I.—P of my intentions, dismiss me now; let me bury my love and my then worthless frame in the same grave. But I will not be so cruel as to compel you to decide my fate. This moment I fly. Farewell, dearest, loveliest of all earthly objects; forget that my unhappy image has, for a brief period, thrown its shadow across your sunny path. One last embrace, one moment of bliss, and the future to me is chaos.” Thus saying, he rushed towards the door, in a well-feigned transport of despair, while the alarmed girl sprang to his side, exclaiming, “What is this I hear? you leave me! it cannot be. Do I not say that I am convinced there is some mistake? Dear Mr. Stillman, compose yourself, while I briefly relate the foul libel on your character, to which I was an unwilling listener.” Throwing himself on the sofa, and leaning his head on his hand, he bade her proceed: and while she was detailing the particulars of Ellen Wilson's statement, his thoughts were occupied in forming a plausible story, whereby to account for the alleged misapprehension of the girl as to the identity of her seducer. As she finished the recital De Lyle said, “I think I have a slight clew to this mystery. Not many weeks since, an acquaintance met me in the street, and asked me where I was going an hour previous, in company with a young girl of slender frame, whose appearance was not the most respectable. I of course replied that he was labouring under some mistake; on which he remarked, that if it was not me, it was my ghost; and if he had not recollected that the individual had on a coat of a different colour from any I possessed, I should have failed to convince him of his error. As, however, I now know the name of the person to whom the girl alludes, I presume that I shall be enabled to place the subject in a correct light.” After a brief stay, he bade her an affectionate adieu, and nothing but the dread of the usurer's becoming acquainted with his villany, prevented him from at once abandoning all farther pursuit of the fair Jewess. On leaving Miss Samuel, he proceeded with no little haste to the residence of Thomas Burchard, and on being closeted with that worthy, desired him instantly to proceed to the dwelling of which Ellen Wilson was an inmate, procure a private interview, and endeavour, in the first place, to bribe her to acknowledge that she was mistaken in his person; or, in the event of his failure, openly denounce her to the woman with whom she lodged, as an impostor, whom he, Burchard, knew to be an abandoned and worthless wretch, who had changed her name. After a brief space had elapsed, Burchard returned with the welcome intelligence that the poor girl had expired a few moments before his arrival at the house. On hearing this, De Lyle with rapid steps returned to the dwelling of Isaac Samuel, saying to Rachel as he entered, “My dear Rachel, after I left you it occurred to me, that the most effectual method of unravelling this mystery will be for you to call on the girl who has charged me with her ruin, and solicit her to afford me an interview to-morrow at this place. I, indeed, regret giving you this trouble, but it appears to be the only course by which I can successfully vindicate my character.” “Oh, Mr. Stillman, how much I thank you for the suggestion. I'll go immediately.” Thus saying, she prepared to depart, with a heart bounding with delight, and De Lyle returned to the pursuit of other projects no less disreputable than that in which he had spent the morning. The death of Ellen Wilson closed every avenue of disclosure to her seducer's infamy, as the female with whom she boarded knew nothing of her previous history, except from her own lips; and all things proceeded between the Jewess and the voluptuary as formerly. The more effectually to remove her suspicions, De Lyle invested Burchard with a respectable suit of apparel, and introduced him to Rachel Samuel, whom he informed, that Mr. Stillman very much resembled a friend of his, unfortunately a wild fellow, named De Lyle, and that the absence of the latter in Europe alone prevented him from confirming his statement by producing him for her satisfaction. Satisfied with this explanation, the deluded girl again confided in De Lyle's honour and affection, and the hours, as they flew, continued to scatter enjoyment in her path.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">P* CHAPTER XIX. THE TRIUMPH OF MALICE. “If thou wert honourable, Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not For such an end thou seek'st; as base, as strange. Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far From thy report as thou from honour.” Cymbeline. “Be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, Thou shalt not escape calumny.” Hamlet. We new return to Clifton, who, on the day succeeding his tête-à-tête with Julia Borrowdale, was elevated to the pinnacle of earthly happiness. During the latter part of the afternoon he had called at her temporary residence, but was informed by her maid that she was absent; and being engaged to spend the evening with Ellingbourne, he left his card and slowly sauntered to the Astor House. The following paragraph, which appeared in the Commercial Advertiser of the next evening, will inform the reader of the result of his visit, and how near the scheme of De Lyle for his ruin approached its successful termination. From the Commercial Advertiser of Oct. —, 18—. Police Court.—Capture Extraordinary! The precincts of the Police Court were this morning crowded with spectators, assembled to hear the examination of a number of the gentry known as black-legs, who were last evening arrested in the exercise of their base vocation, and we regret to state that two individuals, heretofore holding respectable stations in society, were found associated with the delinquents. One of these, a confidential clerk in the counting-room of a wealthy and extensive mercantile firm in this city, has been fully identified as an accomplice; but the second, a gentleman of fortune, who occupies an elevated rank in the fashionable world, appears to have been decoyed into the gaming house, without being aware of the purposes to which its interior was prostituted. “The principal witness, named Thomas Burchard, testified that several nights since he had been fleeced at the same hell of a large sum, and that the clerk before alluded to (whose name we suppress at the particular request of the junior partner of the firm, his employers) was a principal actor in the robbery. The straight-forward story of this witness, apparently an industrious artizan of the middle rank in life, created no little indignation against the well-dressed culprit, who had so largely contributed to his undoing When asked if he was acquainted with the fashionable individual whom we before mentioned, as being caught in bad company, he answered promptly in the affirmative; stating that he was indebted to him for temporary aid, after being plucked of his last fathing; and that, from a long knowledge of his moving in the first society, and the integrity of his character, he believed him totally incapable of associating with such villains as the gamblers, had he known their profession. “Two other witnesses from the country, named Simpkin and Thompson, confirmed the testimony of Burchard as to the respectability of the gentleman last alluded to, adding that they also had been stripped of their loose cash by the villany of a portion of the gang; and although they did not fully identify the merchant's clerk as one of the guilty parties, yet they had a faint recollection of observing a person in the hell whom they believed to be himself. “The prisoners, including the latter individual, were ordered to procure bail in the sum of one thousand dollars each, to appear and answer the charge, or, in default, to stand committed; and the gentleman who was inveigled in their meshes was of course honourably discharged. These daring and reckless offenders have been long under the surveillance of the police, and it is a subject of gratulation that sufficient evidence is at length produced to bring them to trial. The only individual having any pretensions to respectability was, we learn, bailed by the junior partner of the firm before alluded to, who, with great liberality, but with questionable prudence, was induced to save the delinquent from the cheerless solitude of a cell in the bridewell prison. “Perhaps a more striking illustration of the infatuation which leads the gambler to sacrifice everything to his thirst for unlawful gain, was never exhibited than in the person of this young man. Possessing the entire confidence of his employers, allowed a salary more than sufficient to sustain a respectable rank in society, and having in anticipation the prospect of soon becoming interested in the concern as a junior partner, he has, by the indulgence of this destructive vice, brought ruin to his hopes, his morals, and his reputation. “While alluding to this subject, we feel constrained, as public journalists, to call on the community to demand of the authorities prompt and energetic action in relation to these marauders on society. The vice of gaming is increasing to a fearful extent, and parents and guardians are especially required to exercise their united influence in suppressing an evil from whose fatal web, like the shirt of Neseus, the victim struggles in vain to extricate himself. “If previous respectability of character is to shield the accused from the punishment due to his offence, or if the influence of friends interposes to prevent the impartial administration of justice, the laws are proportionably weakened in their efficacy, and the virtuous portion of society lose the ægis of their protection. Let justice be done, therefore, in this case, whoever is the sufferer, and hereafter these black-legs will be compelled to select some other theatre than this city for the exercise of their dark vocation, or be driven to those secret haunts whose infamous character will save respectable individuals from being unwittingly decoyed into their toils.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. A THRUST IN THE DARK.—A CHALLENGE. “Away to heaven, respective lenity, And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now.” Romeo and Juliet. As Clifton left the police court, after being bailed by De Lyle, he proceeded slowly towards the counting-room of his employers, while the distressing events which had prostrated his hopes, and rendered him bankrupt in love and ambition, created a feeling in his mind which bordered on desperation. That he was the victim of some deep-laid conspiracy was evident from the unblushing perjury of the witness Burchard; but it was in vain that he attempted to imagine any probable cause for the malignant feelings which could alone have dictated so desperate a measure for his destruction. That De Lyle's teeming brain gave birth to the foul scheme never entered his thoughts; and after musing for a long period on the subject, he became satisfied that, for some cause unknown to himself, he had incurred the hatred of Ellingbourne, on whom his suspicions were fixed by the apparent friendship of Burchard for the fashionable roué, and his eager anxiety to exempt the latter from suspicion, which seemed to evince the intimate connexion existing between them and the unity of their designs. To what circumstance he should ascribe this malignant hostility, he at first failed to perceive; but suddenly the recollection of Ellingbourne's expressed admiration of Julia Borrowdale, when she appeared at Mrs. Rainsford's soirée, flashed across his mind; and he was compelled to believe that jealousy of his marked attentions to the lovely girl was the foundation of this desperate expedient to destroy him. What rendered the agency of Ellingbourne more certain, was the testimony of Simpkin and Thompson, both of whom had seemed equally anxious with Burchard to exculpate him from censure, while the belief they expressed of his (Clifton's) being in the company of those who rifled their pockets at the gaming-table, confirmed him in this assurance. The only circumstance which tended to exculpate Ellingbourne, was the fact of his being arrested with the gamblers; but that might have occurred through misapprehension of the hour at which the officers were to enter the room, or from some other casualty. Having fully satisfied his mind on this subject, his indignation became so far excited against Ellingbourne that he determined without delay to denounce him in language sufficiently severe to provoke a personal encounter. That he disliked both the principle and practice of duelling, is most true; but the natural hastiness of his temper having in this instance obtained complete ascendency, he conceived no other method of avenging so great an injury; and as for his character that was already lost beyond the hope of recovery. With these feelings he proceeded to the lodgings of Ellingbourne, whom he found traversing the room with marked agitation imprinted on his features. “Mr. Ellingbourne,” said Clifton, “this visit is at a rather unseasonable hour; and I have little doubt that its purport will be considered as inopportune as the time selected for making it. My message is brief but comprehensive. Sir, you are a villain and a coward! The epithets are both applicable to one who seeks the destruction of his fellow through the agency of perjured hirelings. Allow me to repeat the charge, lest your memory should emulate the treachery of your soul, and fail to remind you of its tenor. You understand me, sir, to pronounce you a coward and a villain.” “Mr. Clifton,” replied Ellingbourne, with mingled anger and hesitation in his manner, “I fully comprehend the foul and unjust epithets you have applied to me. If circumstances had not transpired to give you seeming cause for this hasty and violent assault on my character and feelings, no apology or explanation could prevent me from instantly demanding personal satisfaction. Briefly, let me advise Vol. I.—Q you, sir, to withdraw these offensive charges. If you do not retract within five minutes, we are mortal foes. The issue is with you.” “This, sir, is my only reply,” said Clifton, throwing his card on the centre table, and immediately leaving the room. “Infatuated man,” said Ellingbourne, after his departure, “if he will rush on destruction, how can I prevent it? Would that the scoundrel De Lyle were in his stead. That treacherous villain thinks he has deceived me, as to his agency in procuring the arrest of Clifton and myself; but the time will soon arrive when I shall have fleeced him of his all, and then he will ascertain his mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot explain to Clifton, even if my honour would permit, without implicating myself in the transaction. Well, well, I suppose it is my unhappy destiny to be compelled to shoot the man whom I would rescue from infamy, and give the fraternal hug to the reptile I despise. If the arrest had not been made, I should have been enabled to pocket De Lyle's cash, and exonerate Clifton from all difficulty. But the stars have decreed it otherwise.” With these philosophical reflections, Ellingbourne seated himself and despatched a message by a servant to the room of Matthison, soliciting an immediate interview. While the messenger is absent, let us for a moment examine whether most individuals, like Ellingbourne, do not endeavour to throw the burden of their own follies or delinquencies on fate, destiny, or the stars. The merchant hazards his fortune on the issue of a rash venture, which his better judgment should at once have denounced: it fails and he is ruined, and lo! the fates are his sworn foes: the philosopher broaches a favourite theory, and when practical application exhibits its defects, it is his unfortunate destiny: the mechanic expends his substance in building castles in the air, instead of brick and mortar habitations on earth, and as a breath resolves them into their original elements, the gods have interposed for their destruction; while the politician, whose selfish views are evident through professions of regard for the dear people, charges his defeat to ingratitude and the stars! Lo! one thing we have observed among the sons of men, and that is the disposition to deny, stoutly, that their mishaps ever originate with themselves. In a few moments Matthison entered Ellingbourne's apartment, and readily consented to be the bearer of a hostile message to Clifton. Meanwhile our hero had proceeded to his boarding-house, and on reflecting on his interview with Ellingbourne, he could not disguise from himself the manifest injustice and imprudence of his course in refusing him an opportunity for explanation. While musing on the difficulties by which he was surrounded, Matthison entered the sitting-room, and after a courteous salutation, gave him a note, which he opened and read as follows:— “Astor House, Oct. 15, 18—. “Sir, “The insult offered me this morning can only be atoned by affording me the satisfaction due to a gentleman. My friend Piercie Matthison, Esq. the bearer of this, will arrange the necessary details on my part. “I have the honour to be, &amp;c., “Julius Ellingbourne” “To Sydney Clifton, Esquire.” “Sad business, Mr. Clifton,” said Matthison when the note was perused. “My friend Ellingbourne desires particularly to have the matter despatched to-morrow morning, as he is engaged in the evening for Mrs. Willford's ball. As, however, you are the challenged party, the time, distance, and weapons are, of course, subject to your volition. If your stomach should be deranged, and the nerves thereby shaken, we must defer it for a day or two.” Clifton's first impulse on reading the note was to withdraw the charge against Ellingbourne, thereby giving him an opportunity for explanation; but the allusion of Matthison to the state of his nerves, and the nonchalance with which his principal expressed the desire to attend a ball, prevented him from pursuing this magnanimous course. He therefore replied that he was equally anxious with Mr. Ellingbourne, to bring the unhappy affair to a close, and concluded by informing Mr. Matthison that he would instantly procure a friend who would confer with him without delay. Matthison then withdrew, and Clifton despatched a note to Shafton, soliciting his presence on business of importance, that required immediate attention. Before Shafton's arrival De Lyle called at Clifton's room, and was informed of his preparations for a hostile meeting with Ellingbourne; and while the former affected to deplore the necessity of such a step, he yet confessed that he saw no method of honourably avoiding it, offering, at the same time, to call on a friend of his, a skilful surgeon, who he was sure would cheerfully tender his services for such an emergency. While they were conversing Shafton entered, and De Lyle, as he rose to depart, said, “Shafton, take good care of our friend. Ellingbourne is a dead shot, and you must see that he has no advantage of position.” “Why,” said Shafton, with a look of evident satisfaction, “I trust I am qualified to discharge this delicate duty skilfully. My experience in these matters is greater than falls to the lot of most persons. In Paris, sir, I was the friend of three principals, and myself winged my man in a fourth affair. Q* If Clifton only keeps cool, he shall send his opponent to that bourne from whence there is no trav elling. Pretty Good off-hand pun, is it not, De Lyle? Entirely on the spur of the moment, on my honour.” Thus saying, the punster assumed an air of great importance, and chuckled not a little at this favourable opportunity of safely affording the New-York public a well-authenticated specimen of his gallantry and skill in matters appertaining to the duello. On De Lyle's leaving the room, Clifton furnished Shafton with proper credentials, who instantly proceeded to the lodgings of Matthison, to perfect the necessary arrangements. In the evening De Lyle called on our hero, in company with Doctor Searle, who tendered his professional aid, which was accepted; and as the seconds had previously selected the following morning for the meeting, the surgeon promised to call on Clifton by the dawn of day.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. THE COMBAT. “Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more.” Macbeth. “My heart hath one poor string to stay it by, Which holds but till this news be uttered.” King John. On the western shore of the Hudson, in the state of New-Jersey, and directly opposite the city of New-York, sequestered at the base of an elevated range of hills, which at a little distance assume the dignity and abruptness of mountains, lies the romantic village of Hoboken. To the resident of the metropolis its beautiful walk, skirting the margin of the majestic stream, is a favourite afternoon retreat, where the wearied citizen, while listening to the waves as they break upon the beach, or reclining beneath the broad shadows of the willow and the tree of heaven which adorn its banks, can behold before him, as on a map, the giant bee-hive within whose chambers but a few moments previously he, in common with his fellow-insects, was industriously toiling to accumulate a wintry store. Passing northwardly, the gravelled path approaches the river so nearly, that the loiterer with a side step would, at this point, find himself ankle-deep in the pure element; anon it ascends the bank amid shrubbery and wild flowers, until, at the distance of a short mile, the splendid Pavilion, whose ornamented grounds are known as the Elysian Fields, bursts on the view, with a prospect sufficiently captivating to warrant their celestial appellation. In the same direction, about two miles from Hoboken, over-looking the river and city, the mountains of Weehawken point their cliffs toward the sky; and in an alcove whose area is perhaps two hundred yards in diameter,—scooped out of their rocky base at creation's birth, or by some subsequent convulsion of nature,—is the celebrated duelling-ground where Burr shot Hamilton, and to whose secluded precincts all successive city candidates for bullets and immortality have resorted on like occasions. At early dawn, the day following Clifton's receipt of the challenge, a row-boat with two oarsmen and five passengers might be observed moving over the placid surface of the noble river, towards this picturesque and secluded spot; and just as the sunbeams tipped the summit of the mountains, the party disembarked; and Clifton, Ellingbourne, Matthison, Shafton, and the surgeon proceeded to the execution of their hostile purpose. On landing, the eye of Clifton ranged over the quiet and lonely semi-amphitheatre; and as all traces of anger had vanished from his bosom, he thought it little less than sacrilege to desecrate so lovely a scene with the sanguinary evidences of man's warring passions. From this reverie he was aroused by Shafton, who, in an under tone, said, “Now, Clifton, be cool and collected. If the time will admit, reserve your fire until you have received that of your opponent, unless you have the utmost confidence in your capacity to execute a rapid movement successfully. But before I leave you, let me beseech you to dismiss from your mind the silly determination you expressed last evening, to throw away your fire. 'Tis absolute madness; for I have Matthison's assurance that Ellingbourne never was more implacable and determined on any similar occasion; and as he has frequently acted as his second, of course he is little likely to err. By strictly following my instructions we shall leave the ground with a reputation that neither malice nor envy can dart a Shaft-on. Excusez, mon ami, the pun would out.” “Permit me to remark,” said Clifton, “that I by no means authorize any resort to stratagem to secure an advantage of position. Having voluntarily entered the lists, I scorn the attempt to gain by man œuvre what I lack in skill. Let the ground be chosen, therefore, with sole reference to its general eligibility, and not from a desire to give me an undue advantage.” “The age of chivalry is past,” replied Shafton; “and as etiquette places this whole matter in my hands, I shall take my own method of executing the trust. If I should follow your directions, I fear that you would shortly intrude on my province by measuring six feet more or less of the ground selected.” Thus saying, our volatile friend joined Matthison, and they proceeded to the selection of the ground. On reaching a favourable spot, Shafton paced off the requisite distance in a line running north and south, and parallel with the course of the river, leaving Ellingbourne's position covered by a clump of bushes, which were of course in the range of Clifton's fire, thus affording a prominent object whereby to direct his aim. While his second was thus employed, Clifton, like the eastern devotee, turned his gaze towards the spot where sojourned that bright being who was the object of his heart's idolatry. The morning was peculiarly bland and lovely, and each varied sound of the awakening city came wafted to his ear mellowed by distance, and freighted with the charms of memory and association. “Beautiful and prosperous island city,” thus he mused, “queen of the western world, within whose sea-girt boundaries my buoyant imagination first spread her pinions towards the bright realms of poetry and romance! Years in their ceaseless flight will continue to pour their tribute of wealth and abundance into thy lap, but perchance the eyes that now gaze on thee will in a few brief moments be veiled by the films of death. “And what, if, before yon rising luminary quenches his glowing fires in the western ocean, my summer friends shall have exhausted the shallow fountain of their sympathies at my sudden exit, and the busy multitudes within whose circle I have lived and moved, pass to their ephemeral schemes of pleasure or ambition, as if no such event had rippled along the surface of their recollections,—at least, the bright being with whom my fate is linked, and my beloved foster-parents, will mourn my unhappy departure. And Thou, merciful author of my being! who hast been to me `the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night,' if it be consistent with thy wise decrees, vouchsafe to deliver me from the peril of this awful hour; but if it is my self-appointed doom to rush uncalled for into Thy august and holy Presence, forgive the rash and criminal act, for the sake of Him who is our Mediator at Thy throne.” With this mental ejaculation, Clifton braced his nerves to meet, with becoming calmness and fortitude, the eventful crisis, which he now viewed with far different sentiments from those which actuated him when he precipitated the hostile meeting by a voluntary insult to his antagonist. While occupied in these reflections, Ellingbourne, who, in the pursuit of his disreputable calling, had become a perfect adept in detecting the latent feeling through the index of the countenance, at once perceived that the heart of his opponent, although shadowed with melancholy, quailed not at the danger which he was to encounter. “I like not,” thought the gambler, “the cool, dispassionate determination, depicted in Clifton's features. I have certainly underrated his courage; and although inexperienced in affairs of honour, there is no little danger to be apprehended from the fire of one whose steady nerves are the faithful ministers of his will. It behooves me to review Matthison's selection of the ground, lest I be compelled to take an unfavourable position.” Just at this moment Matthison had reached the point at which Shafton proposed to station Ellingbourne, while the punster occupied the spot assigned to Clifton. As yet Matthison had not objected to Shafton's selection; but the sharp significant cough of his principal attracted his attention, and perceiving by his countenance that he was dissatisfied with some portion of the arrangements, he reviewed the capabilities of the ground, and soon saw the decided advantage it afforded Clifton. Passing, therefore, to the side of Shafton, he said, “My dear sir, by the merest accident, you have placed my principal directly in the range of that small cluster of shrubbery, which your experienced eye will at once perceive forms a prominent background in the line of Mr. Clifton's fire. Surely my stomach is somewhat deranged, or I should sooner have observed this difficulty.” “Oh,” replied Shafton, carelessly, “if there is any advantage of position, I have no objection to change the direction of our principals, although, permit me to say, that by your assent to the proposed arrangement, I have an undoubted right to insist on its being adhered to. As I have, however, every confidence in Mr. Clifton's coolness and gallantry, I will, from courtesy, reverse the stations in a line from east to west, placing my friend with his back to the river; and by glancing your eye over the ground, you will observe that neither tree, rock, nor shrub, is in the range of Mr. Ellingbourne.” “That will do,” said Matthison, placing himself in a situation to examine the ground; “and with your permission, we will now station our principals.” Thus saying, the combatants were assigned to the places selected, and the seconds proceeded to load the pistols. While thus occupied, the sunbeams, which had gradually descended the brow of the mountain, poured their light in Ellingbourne's face, and Matthison too late perceived that the change of Vol. I.—R ground had been the reverse of favourable to his principal. That his chagrin at being thus over-reached was fully shared by Ellingbourne, cannot be a matter of surprise; and the latter, who at first considered the meeting rather in the light of a morning's amusement than a dangerous combat, in which his life might be hazarded, now viewed the subject in a more serious mood, and mentally determined to exercise all his acknowledged skill, in revenging the insult he had received, and foiling Shafton in his wily manœuvre. The words “one, two, three,” were the signal, at whose utterance the leaden heralds were to wing their dangerous flight; and the first had scarcely been pronounced, when the sharp ring of Ellingbourne's weapon echoed from cliff to cliff, and was succeeded by the report of Clifton's; and the groan that burst from the gambler, and his sudden spring into the air, gave instant proof that the shot had taken effect. Dr. Searle at once ran to the assistance of the wounded man, and, on removing his clothing, it was ascertained that he had received the ball in the left side, between the short ribs; and the grave looks of the surgeon indicated Ellingbourne's critical situation. “Doctor,” said our hero, with the utmost agony depicted in his countenance, “is the wound dangerous? Inform me, I beseech you; for, should it prove mortal, I have reached the last happy moment of my existence.” “Be calm, my friend,” replied the professional gentleman; “as yet I cannot determine the precise nature of the injury.” Then taking Shafton's arm and drawing him aside, he whispered, “Let Mr. Clifton seek safety in flight. Life and death are certainly in the keeping of Providence, but I will not insure Mr. Ellingbourne's existence for an hour. I perceive that you have provided a second boat; and if Mr. Clifton is wise, he will, without a moment's delay, secure a safe retreat.” While the surgeon and Shafton were conversing, Clifton caught the hand of Ellingbourne, who was supported in a sitting position by Matthison, saying, “My dear sir, can you forgive me for this rash and dreadful act? Indeed, indeed, I bore you no malice, and trust I am pardoned for the injury I have inflicted. Would to Heaven I could recall this morning's fearful proceedings.” Ellingbourne, who, although pale and evidently apprehensive that his wound would prove fatal, yet preserved his accustomed calmness of manner, replied: “Mr. Clifton, most cheerfully do I bear witness to your courage and gallantry; if you proffer a reconciliation I surely will not reject it. There is my hand, and although my strength will not permit me to press yours with the ardour I would desire, yet the will is not wanting. If I live and have an opportunity to explain matters which to you are still shrouded in mystery, you will find the error under which you have laboured in relation to my agency in certain transactions which have recently occurred. If otherwise, I must refer you to that hour in which all secrets will be revealed.” At this moment Shafton beckoned Clifton, saying, “Time is short; Ellingbourne's wound is decidedly mortal; the surgeon has just informed me that he cannot live an hour. Under these circumstances, we must take to the boat I have placed in reserve, and run for life. Fortunately the oarsmen are two expert Whitehallers, and will land us in the city in the twinkling of an eye. So allons, mon ami.” Our hero's first impulse was to await the issue of his antagonist's wound, before securing his own safety; but the solemn assurance of Shafton and the surgeon that no time was to be lost if he wished to avoid arrest and imprisonment, and the reflection that his presence could be of no avail in averting the fatal consequences of Ellingbourne's injury, at length determined him to listen to the advice of his friend. Before leaving the ground, he again entreated Ellingbourne's forgiveness, who, with much apparent feeling, besought him not to suffer his mind to dwell on a calamity which might have been, by the merest accident, transferred to himself. “If I should recover,” said the gambler, feebly, “it is well: but if not, why the leap into the unknown and unexplored futurity is but a few years in anticipation of that to which I am destined by the ordinary operation of nature. And why should I repine? The bright visions of my youth have already vanished; and it matters little how soon I am removed from a scene where neither friends nor kindred shed the sunshine of their affection on my cheerless way.” Here a deep groan arrested his utterance; but whether it was caused by the anguish of his wound, or by grief of heart, we can only conjecture. Dashing a tear from his eye, he resumed: “Curse the wound, it makes me play the woman. Adieu, Mr. Clifton; God bless you; wherever you go, remember my assurances of innocence in all that relates to the injurious imputations on your character.” “Farewell, my brave antagonist,” was Clifton's reply, in a voice almost stifled with emotion, when he slowly proceeded with Shafton to the boat, and in a few moments the slender skiff with its freight was leaping on the blue waters, under the powerful and steady pull of the athletic and skilful oarsmen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">R* CHAPTER XXII. A TALE-BEARER REBUKED. “Away, away, the tale is false.” The mental eye, like the corporeal, being limited in its range, can only embrace a certain number of objects at one view; and to initiate our readers in secrets with which they are yet unacquainted, it becomes necessary to revert to events that transpired on the evening which saw Clifton and the gamblers placed in durance. On De Lyle's retiring to rest after the interview with Burchard, he calmly reflected on the probable consequences of the bold step he had taken, and was forced to admit that there was no little peril involved in the issue if immediate measures were not devised to prevent it. Although the plan of decoying Clifton to the gambling-house was the joint production of Ellingbourne and himself, yet the subsequent arrest of the parties, and the public exposure which would necessarily result, originated entirely with De Lyle, who was goaded on by the demon of jealousy, and could not await the slow process by which the gambler and himself had proposed to destroy the reputation and prospects of his victim. While pushing forward his measures by the aid of Burchard, he did not pause to reflect on the difficulties connected with their accomplishment; but now that the excitement of the moment had passed away, he perceived the necessity of instant action. That Ellingbourne would be indignant at his arrest, and lay the onus at his door, was self evident; while the result would be not only to thwart his scheme of revenge against Clifton, but in all probability, to expose the whole of his guilty practices, and the ruinous method by which he procured the means of their pursuit. Alarmed at the prospect, he arose, dressed himself in the utmost haste, and gliding silently to the front door of his father's mansion, proceeded with rapid steps to the dwelling of Burchard; and after a long and anxious conference, it was determined that Ellingbourne should be exonerated at any hazard. That the pliable instrument of De Lyle faithfully obeyed his behest, is apparent from the extract in a previous chapter, from one of the journals of the day. After the great object of De Lyle was accomplished, he proposed to visit Miss Borrowdale, first proceeding to the office of the Commercial Advertiser, where, under a hypocritical affectation of regard for Clifton, he furnished the editor with minute details of the transaction; and while soliciting the suppression of our hero's name, took especial care to have the curiosity of the public so fully excited that the story would fly with greater rapidity than if the name and particulars were at first published. To add to the effect of his revelations, he visited the extended circle of his acquaintance, and so introduced the subject as to have the development seemingly drawn from him against his will, thus securing for himself the character of Clifton's friend and apologist, while he was hurling the poisoned barb that destroyed his reputation. When he rang the bell at the residence of Mr. Elwell, and was admitted, Miss Borrowdale's attendant was, by previous concert, anxiously awaiting his appearance; and hastily informing her of the success of his scheme for our hero's destruction, he was invited to a seat in the parlour, while the girl proceeded to inform her mistress of his desire to pay his respects. “Mary, say I am engaged, and cannot, this morning, wait on him,” said Julia to the maid, when De Lyle's name was announced. “Why, Miss Borrowdale,” replied the girl, “I told him you was dressed and jist going out; but he said he wouldn't keep you a minute, as he only wanted to make his bow. Forgive me if I did wrong, for I spoke before I thought; but I suppose he'll think strange if you don't jist say how do-do to him.” “Oh, if you have given him this information, I will run down in my hat and shawl, and despatch my intrusive visitor, while cousin Helen is finishing her toilette.” Thus saying, Julia descended to the parlour. “I fear, Miss Borrowdale,” said De Lyle, “that you will consider me intrusive; but, independent of my desire to pay my devoirs to a lady in whom I feel a deep and fervent interest, a circumstance has unfortunately transpired this morning, which so fatally affects the character of a young gentleman whom I have heretofore considered respectable, and with whom you are acquainted, that I deemed it my duty, however painful to my feelings, to apprize you of it. I aliude to Mr. Clifton, to whom I was indebted for the pleasure of an introduction to yourself at Mrs. Rainsford's soirée.” During the delivery of this imposing preface, which was intended to be marked by due gravity of demeanor, De Lyle could not entirely conceal his satisfaction at the opportunity thus afforded him to stab the reputation of Clifton in the most vital part; and although Julia was not a little embarrassed, she yet retained sufficient fortitude to perceive the triumph that beamed in the eye of De Lyle; and rising as he paused in his remarks, and drawing up her figure to its full height, she said, “Pardon me, sir, if I cannot perceive either the necessity, or the propriety, of this interference with matters which, if they do not concern me solely, I have not yet entrusted to Mr. De Lyle's guardianship. As this appears to constitute your principal business with me, and as I was prepared to make calls on your arrival, I must take the liberty of wishing you good-morning.” Having given De Lyle this cut direct, Julia, with a slight courtesy, left the room; and before the surprised news-vender had time to collect his scattered thoughts, she had reached her own apartment. Throwing herself on the sofa, she burst into tears, and while her face was buried in her hands, Helen entered the room, and inquired, with the utmost astonishment, what was the cause of her grief and agitation. This was a question somewhat difficult for her to answer, as she was totally unacquainted with Clifton's crime, if crime he had committed; and although she could fully answer to her own conscience for her treatment of De Lyle, yet it was less easy to explain it satisfactorily to a third party. Desiring Helen, therefore, to make her morning-calls without her, she said she would explain the nature and cause of her emotions on her return; and her cousin, after a fruitless effort to induce Julia to accompany her, proceeded to her carriage. As she descended the stairs, De Lyle, who had remained in the parlour for several minutes after Miss Borrowdale's sudden exit, opened the door which communicated with the hall, and was accosted by Helen, who said, “Mr. De Lyle, you surely were not going to leave the house without paying me the courtesy even of a word, or at all events a silent bow.” “Understanding that Miss Elwell was about making her morning calls, I hesitated to inflict my company on her, and intended to await a more opportune moment, to pay my respects. In such cases a gentleman's card is, I believe, more acceptable than his presence,” replied De Lyle, laughingly. “While he was delivering his ready reply, Helen bethought her that his presence, in all probability, was connected with the agitation of Julia; and being deeply imbued with that curiosity which has descended in an especial degree to the daughters of Eve, she determined to elicit the facts, and therefore said, “Mr. De Lyle, my calls are not so urgent that I cannot spare a few moments for a friend. Besides, I want you to tell me what is going on in the world. Positively, I have not mingled with the busy throng for forty-eight hours, and am, of course, dying with curiosity to know all the strange and tragical or comical events that must have happened in that time. Tell me, now, who is dead, who married; who has committed suicide,—or who is likely to perform either of these monstrosities within the next half-a-dozen hours?” “Why, Miss Elwell,” said De Lyle, who was equally desirous to communicate what she wished to learn, “neither of the unhappy circumstances that you speak of has occurred; but one of our unlucky friends has involved himself in such a scrape. You know Mr. Clifton, our confidential clerk, whom we so highly esteemed—would you believe it? He was last night arrested in a notorious gambling-house, and proof was elicited which fully inculpated him as one of the most guilty of the gang.” “Oh, I see how it is,” said Helen; “some unsuccessful rival has been decoying the poor fellow into a hell, and then taken the opportunity to expose him.” The sudden start of De Lyle at once flashed conviction on her mind, of a truth that she had scarcely before imagined, for her remark was the result of a sudden desire to exculpate Clifton, whom she admired, rather than of any well-defined idea of his innocence. Appearing, therefore, not to observe De Lyle's agitation, she resumed, “I would at least fain think that so exemplary and accomplished a young gentleman as Clifton, was drawn into this difficulty, originally, through inadvertence; if such is not the case, why either the rope, laudanum, or a speedy reformation is desirable.” The conversation between the roué and his fair and fashionable companion, lasted but for a few moments after this development, as the lady ascertained that she was in possession of all the facts, and De Lyle had accomplished his purpose in communicating Clifton's disgrace in a quarter whence it must reach the ears of Julia, before he could obtain an interview and disabuse her mind. As De Lyle left the house, he dwelt with no little chagrin on the marked disgust with which his efforts to inculpate our hero was received by Julia; but this untoward circumstance increased his desire to ruin Clifton, and thereby destroy the happiness of the fair girl, if he could not induce her to favour his addresses. The thoughts of Helen, also, rested on the same subject; and when she was seated in the carriage, her reflections caused a right interpretation of De Lyle's embarrassment at her accidentally alluding to the true causes of Clifton's arrest. Yet to conceal from Julia her convictions on this subject, she determined to relate all the circumstances tending to criminate Clifton, without any allusion to those which might exhibit the baseness of De Lyle. This course she was induced to pursue, not only in consequence of her being piqued at the preference of our hero for her fair cousin, but from a vague desire to attract him to herself, and let him know that to her he was indebted for his restoration to his former rank in society. “If he is indifferent to my regard,” she thought, “let him float down the stream of time with the brand of disgrace on his brow:—why should I stretch out my hand to snatch him from ignominy, Vol. 1.—S if I cannot thereby ensure his gratitude and devotion?” While she was absorbed in these selfish reflections, her carriage rolled along the pavement in Broadway; and drawing up to the door of Stewart's fancy store, she alighted among a crowd of fashionably-dressed ladies, who were about examining the rich array of silks and satins that was displayed from every part of the extensive warehouse. After Helen's departure, Julia pondered deeply on the proper course to pursue towards her cousin, and at length resolved ingenuously to inform her of De Lyle's conduct, and the causes which prevented her from awaiting the development. Accordingly, on Helen's return, she related the circumstances with which the reader is acquainted, adding, that De Lyle's deportment so distinctly bore the character of insolence, that she could not brook longer parley with him. In return, Helen imparted the particulars of Clifton's disgrace, leaving poor Julia in the most agonizing state of astonishment and sorrow. When left to herself, the mind of the generous girl at once acquitted Clifton of the crimes imputed to him, notwithstanding the evident effort of her cousin to impress her with a conviction of his guilt. “Helen neither knows nor appreciates the purity and elevation of his soul,” she said to herself, “or she would not, for a moment, believe him unworthy. Had she listened, as I have done, to his noble and exalted sentiments, she would not retain her present impressions.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. FURTHER DISAPPOINTMENTS.—PLOTS, AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES. “The swains may in manners compare, But their love is not equal to mine.” Shenstone. While Julia was anxiously awaiting Clifton's appearance to explain the nature of the difficulties into which he had fallen, he was occupied, as has been seen, in perfecting the arrangements for a meeting with Ellingbourne; but after the whole matter had been placed in the charge of Shafton, his first impulse led him to visit the residence of Miss Borrowdale, and inform her of the true circumstances connected with his unfortunate arrest. The reader need scarcely be informed that her attendant had rapidly improved in intrigue and deception under the guidance of so able a teacher as De Lyle; and when Clifton presented himself at the door, she boldly informed him that Miss Borrowdale had been absent for more than an hour, and that her visit would occupy the whole of the morning. Profoundly regretting the untoward circumstance which deprived him of an early opportunity to vindicate himself with the lovely girl, he retired to his lodgings, and occupied the time before the usual dinner hour in making such memoranda as would be necessary if the meeting with his antagonist should prove fatal to himself. After the performance of this duty, he dwelt with no little chagrin and mortification on the probability of Julia's being informed of the circumstances connected with his disgraceful arrest and public examination while making her morning calls; and the reflections attendant upon her apprehension of such an event effectually overshadowed the feeble ray of hope that had still gleamed around the prospect before him. Dinner disposed of, he again proceeded to the dwelling of Mr. Elwell, and was certain that he observed the form of Julia ascending the winding stairs that communicated with the second story, as he opened the hall door; but the treacherous attendant again replied to his inquiries for Miss Borrowdale that she was absent. Determined, if possible, to obtain an interview, he gave the girl his card, which he desired her to present to the lady, if she was in the house, with his compliments, and say that he solicited a moment's interview, on a subject of great importance. This the girl affected to perform, but returned, with the card, saying that Miss Borrowdale was not at home. Distracted with doubt and apprehension, he slowly wended his way to his room, and, after a few moment's reflection, determined to address a letter to S* Julia, avowing his innocence of the charges preferred against him, and to ensure its safe delivery he resolved to convey it himself to her residence. In compliance with this resolve, he arranged his writing materials, and indited the following epistle: “No.—, — street, “Saturday, Oct. —, 18—. “Dear Miss Borrowdale, “Why, oh why am I not permitted an interview on which the whole happiness of my future life depends? Can it be that the lovely and just being whose partiality and goodness hesitated to chide my presumption in tendering vows of love and fidelity, has joined the censorious and heartless world in imputing to me crimes at which my soul recoils? No, no; it cannot be; and yet thrice have I called at your residence without succeeding in obtaining an audience; and when I made the last abortive effort this afternoon, although your matchless form was seen gliding from my sight, yet your servant stated that you were not at home. How then am I to account for this prostration of my dearest hopes? Surely none of Mr. Elwell's family can bear me ill-will, for with none have I the pleasure of an acquaintance, unless that might be termed such which was caused by my introduction to Miss Helen through yourself at Mrs. Rainsford's soirée. Alas, a sudden light bursts on my vision, by whose glare I perceive the unwelcome truth. The rival whose malice has wrought the meshes of the fatal web in which my character is ensnared, has, by some cunningly-devised fable, forced an unwilling conviction of my baseness on your mind; or, what is more probable, has so prejudiced your relatives that they have directed the servant to deny me the happiness of personally exculpating myself from the charges preferred against me. “But, my dear Miss Borrowdale, whatever may have been the cause of my inability to pour into your ear the story of my wrongs, let no tale that slander may invent for a moment deprive me of your esteem —I dare not say of your love. If I do not perfectly convince you of my innocence, nay, if the world is not wholly disabused of every impression derogatory to the purity of my character, no selfish views will ever induce me to solicit your favourable notice. Think you that I could be sufficiently base to desire to link so bright and glorious a being as yourself, to the fortunes of one who carried on his brow the foul brand of the world's contempt and scorn? No, dearest of all earthly objects; the love I bear you draws its inspiration from a source too pure and holy to excite in my bosom a single impulse unworthy of yourself. “That I shall be enabled to meet you this evening, is, I fear, improbable, although I must renew the effort, and, if I fail, will leave this communication with the servant to be given you. Dearest lady, life is at best uncertain; and if by any untoward event we should never again meet in this world, blessed be our Creator, there is another sphere where neither jealousy, nor malice, nor envy can disturb our happiness. Perhaps you may feel inclined to smile at this melancholy foreboding, but coming events cast their shadows before me, and it is needless to deny that I am surrounded by perils, from which, however, hope persuades me I shall escape unscathed. If I do, you will soon hear from me again; if not, accept the devotion of one who owns no greater frailties than ordinarily fall to the lot of erring mortals; the most unpardonable of which is the presumption that induces him to declare himself “Your devoted and constant lover, “Sydney Clifton.” “To Miss Julia Borrowdale.” After finishing and sealing his letter, Clifton again directed his steps to the residence of Mr. Elwell, and was met by Julia's maid, who, as usual, stated that Miss Borrowdale was not at home; and as he gave her the letter, with a particular request that it should be delivered to the young lady in person and to none other, the evident scorn which appeared in the curl of her lip, and the half sneer with which she extended her thumb and finger to receive it, were sufficient evidence to convince Clifton that the busy tongue of rumor had already wafted his disgrace to the ears of Mr. Elwell's household. That his reflections connected with this subject, and the hostile meeting with Ellingbourne, were most unhappy, is true;—but even now hope whispered that Julia was not aware of his exertions to procure an interview, while the same smiling goddess almost convinced him that he should not fall by the bullet of his antagonist. Shortly after Clifton's delivery of the letter to the treacherous girl, an individual called at Mr. Elwell's mansion and left another epistle, which was couched in the following language: “New- Yorke, Oct. 18—. “Mis borodel, “the riter of these lines happins to bee an unfortunit yuth whu wuld hav bin onnist and industrus if hee hadn't hav bin siddused bi bad cumpennee and got intu scrapes in that are way. now the reesun that i rite this is to tel yu as hou mister sidnee Cliftin has bin usin yur name pruttee cunsidderablee, up to the blak hoal, as wee cal it, whear wee pla lew and wist, and rolet, not to say nothin about a tuch of farrow, and so on. in this hear way, yu sea, mister Sidnee clifton got us al inter trubble last nite; for, ses hee, arter hee had drinked plentee of shampane, slappin his phist on the tabel, ses hee, dam the man as ses Julee borodel ain't the bootifoolest, and the hansimest, and the charminist gal in al york; hear, ses hees, hur helth, and ile cramm the glas doun annee rascils throte what won't go the hoal bumpur.

That she was correct in this conjecture, the reader, no doubt, is prepared to believe; but if called on for her reasons for her suspicions, they would probably have appeared far from satisfactory to the uninitiated.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. REPENTANCE WITHOUT ABSOLUTION. AN ADIEU. “No voice well known through many a day, To speak the last, the parting word; Which, when all other sounds decay, Is still like distant music heard.” MOORE The boat which bore our hero and his second from the scene of combat danced merrily over the tranquil bosom of the noble Hudson, and to one whose mind was un-oppressed with present or impending calamity, the rapid and measured strokes of the slender oars, which swayed almost to the form of a semi-circle, under the strong pull of the boatmen; the yo-heave-ho of the stevedores and riggers, whose rude melody came blithely over the waters from the quays of the busy city; the fleet of rivercraft, of every form and size, that spread their canvass to the breeze; the clouds of smoke that ascended in spiral wreaths from the numerous steam-vessels, whose promenade and quarter-decks were crowded with passengers, and the clinking of hammers from the foundries that are situated near the wharves, formed a combination well fitted to awake an absorbing and delightful interest. But to all these pleasant features of the scene, Clifton was insensible; nor did the witticisms with which his mercurial companion interlarded his conversation serve to divert his thoughts from the agonizing reflection that, however the world might palliate the crime of which he was guilty, or custom throw over it the mantle of false honour, his conscience must for ever be oppressed with the conviction, that unmitigated murder rested on his soul. “Away,” said he, mentally, “with the sophistries of pride and hypocrisy:—to myself, at least, let me acknowledge that I am neither more nor less than a murderer! the base son of a guilty sire, I have now but to consummate my guilt by the commission of suicide, and the parallel between parent and offspring will be perfect.” Absorbed in these painful reflections, he scarcely perceived that the boat had touched the wharf, until his companion shouted in his ear:— “Why, Clifton, what the devil ails you? You certainly do not mean to float down the stream of time in a craft three feet by fifteen, more or less? Allons, allons. Let's be off in a whisk, as the butcher said to the fly.” On this sally, Clifton, without reply, leaped on the wharf, and was met by De Lyle, who, having previously ascertained where the party were to land, was in waiting to learn the result of the contest. That the pleasure with which he received the information of Ellingbourne's being dangerously wounded was veiled by an artificial exhibition of grief, may be readily inferred; but the eye of suspicion would have detected the latent twinkle of satisfaction playing on his countenance, as he reflected that, if indelible ignominy was not now stamped on his rival, he would, at least, be compelled to fly the country, while Ellingbourne, whom he feared, and therefore hated, and whose services were no longer required, would, he fondly hoped, be consigned to that grave whose secrets would never, in this world, rise up in judgment against him. “This is indeed disastrous,” said De Lyle, after Shafton had detailed the result of the contest, “and will render Mr. Clifton's concealment absolutely necessary. Although the beau monde good-naturedly pronounces the death of a principal in an affair of honour, justifiable, yet judges, and juries composed of mechanics, and such like canàille, are not so lenient; and although a halter might not be the inevitable consequence of a trial and conviction, still a long and tedious imprisonment would result, which, I take for granted, our friend is far from coveting. Under these circumstances, the question arises, where are we to conceal Clifton until the issue of this unfortunate business is known?” Our hero's reflections had, before landing, almost Vol. I.—T determined him to await the result of his antagonist's wound, and submit, voluntarily, to the ordeal of a trial, if it proved fatal; but the love of life, and the still, small voice of hope, which was not entirely silenced in his breast, joined with the persuasions of Shafton and De Lyle, induced him to reverse this impolitic resolution. “I know of no place of concealment,” he replied, mournfully, “except in the house of my foster-parents. Although it will break the hearts of this kind couple, to whom I am so deeply indebted, yet, as they must finally become acquainted with the facts, it will perhaps be better for me to communicate them in person. I will therefore proceed to their residence, and await your decision as to my future course, should Mr. Ellingbourne not survive.” Thus saying, Clifton slowly directed his steps to his temporary asylum, while De Lyle and Shafton repaired to Ellingbourne's lodgings, to which they presumed he would be conveyed, in any event. That the excellent and amiable lady to whom Clifton was indebted for the perfection of those moral impressions which were early instilled in his mind, was deeply grieved at the unhappy position in which he was placed by the indulgence of his constitutional rashness, will be readily imagined; but as reproof and regret were alike unavailing, she, with that firmness, affection, and prudence, which were so happily blended in her character, at once proceeded to provide for the necessities of our hero, should he be compelled to seek refuge in a foreign clime. For this purpose, she immediately despatched a messenger for her husband, who, in compliance with her request, conveyed the travelling trunk of Clifton, and such portion of his wardrobe as was requisite, from his boarding-house to their residence, and in an hour from that period, the industry of Mrs. Clifton had provided every necessary and even luxury that could be required, for a sea-voyage. During the progress of these preparations, Clifton continued to pace the floor in a state of mind that may be conceived but not portrayed: and the echo of every foot-fall that was heard near the door of his temporary abode, was listened to with intense anxiety, in the expectation of receiving the fatal intelligence of his opponent's death. It was about the hour of mid-day that De Lyle entered the room with the sad information, that although Ellingbourne was still living, it was next to impossible that he could survive the day. He also informed him, that Shafton and himself had procured a passage for him on board a vessel then lying in the stream, and bound for Liverpool, which would sail early on the following morning; stating, that he had imparted to the captain, in confidence, (who was his particular friend,) the true cause of Clifton's departure, and that the captain had promised to use his best exertions to ensure his safety. De Lyle then left, after advising our hero to be ready at a moment's warning, as he would, during the afternoon, call with a carriage to convey him to the ship's boat, which would be in waiting at the wharf to receive him. On the receipt of this melancholy information, Clifton immediately addressed the following brief letter to his adored Julia. “Saturday, 2 P. M. “My dear, lost Julia, “How can I convey the sad intelligence of an event which has shipwrecked every hope connected with you and happiness? Briefly, then:—in a fatal hour I consented to a hostile meeting with Mr. Julius Ellingbourne this morning, and the result is, that my antagonist at this moment lies mortally wounded at his lodgings, in the Astor House. That I am in the toils of a most foul and deep-laid conspiracy against my character; that this rash meeting has, in its consequences, severed every hope I might otherwise have entertained of exculpating myself in the opinion of the world; that I have been goaded on by some fiend or fiends in human shape, who have too successfully accomplished my ruin: and that life will, hereafter, be a curse rather than a blessing, are truths which admit not of denial, but will never, I fear, be susceptible of satisfactory explanation. Farewell, then, my life, my love; a long, a last farewell. “My intention was to recommend you to forget that such a wretch as myself ever crossed your path; but my hand refuses to trace the sentence, and my too selfish heart hesitates to resign the fond wish, that although for ever separated from your presence, I may still continue to live in your recollection. “Dearest, dearest lady, receive the last adieu of your once happy lover, “Sydney Clifton.” “To Miss Julia Borrowdale.” Having finished this epistle, Clifton despatched it by his foster-father, with instructions if possible to deliver it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed. On arriving at Mr. Elwell's door, Miss Helen was descending to the hall, and presuming, from the description, that she was the person he sought, the elder Clifton placed it in her hands, and after learning from the lady that it was rightly delivered, he left the house. Helen, on receiving the letter, repaired to her room, and locking the door, pondered deeply on the course she should pursue; and after quieting her conscience with the hypocritical reflection that she was securing Julia's happiness by exercising a supervision over her correspondence with so dangerous a person as Clifton, she broke the seal and eagerly perused the contents of the billet. Ascertaining that it afforded no clew either to the writer's innocence or De Lyle's agency in defaming his character, while it evidently favoured the conclusion that Ellingbourne was his rival and slanderer, she re-sealed the letter and handed it to the servant for Miss Borrowdale. Julia with no little trepidation devoured its contents; and on realizing its full import, swooned on the sofa on which she was reclining, but, fortunately, recovered consciousness before any person entered the room. Her first impressions were, on reviving, that her lover, by his own acknowledgment, was unworthy of her regard; but, on again perusing the letter, his solemn asseveration that he was the victim of an odious conspiracy, satisfied her that the only crime of which he was guilty was the death of Ellingbourne, which, although in her estimation a grievous offence against his fellow-man, yet, by the pernicious customs of society, the meeting, she was aware, could not have been declined, except at the hazard of his being discarded from every respectable and fashionable circle. The more she reflected on the subject, the less did she blame her lover for his rashness, and before the dinner hour arrived her love had so far warped her judgment that it is questionable whether, if our hero had stood in her presence, she would not have pronounced her forgiveness of all past offences, had the culprit promised reformation. Near the hour of five o'clock De Lyle and Shafton called at Clifton's temporary retreat in a carriage, and the former handed him an evening paper, in which he read the following paragraph: “POSTCRIPT!! “SECOND EDITION. “Fatal Encounter.—Our readers will recollect the article published in our yesterday's edition, headed `Police Court—Capture extraordinary,' in which the arrest and examination of a knot of gamblers were stated, together with the fact that two citizens, hitherto considered respectable, one a clerk in an extensive mercantile establishment, and the other a gentleman of fashion, were implicated. Although, on that occasion, we were induced to suppress the names of the parties, from respect to the feelings of their friends, yet so public has the exposure become, in consequence of the events which have this morning transpired, that further concealment is neither possible nor expedient. It is therefore our duty, as public journalists, to state that the person first alluded to is Mr. Sydney Clifton, a confidential clerk in the counting-room of Messrs. De Lyle, Howard &amp; Co., and that Julius Ellingbourne, Esquire, a gentleman so well and favourably known in the fashionable world, is the latter. It now appears that circumstances connected with the arrest of the parties led to a hostile meeting at Hoboken, early this morning, when Mr. Ellingbourne received the ball of Clifton in his side, near the region of the heart. From the extremely dangerous character of the wound, it is not expected that the life of Mr. Ellingbourne will be protracted many hours. Thus the vice of gaming, in which this young man indulged, has at length been followed by the commission of murder! What a warning does this fact convey to the youth of our city to abstain from the incipient stages of dissipation, in whose fatal vortex honour, integrity, and even life, are frequently ingulfed.” “SECOND POSTCRIPT!—4 P.M. “We now learn, from the best authority, that the wealthy and accomplished Mr. Ellingbourne has this moment breathed his last. `Sic transit gloria mundi!' ” On perusing this fatal intelligence, Clifton, with a heavy heart bade adieu to his kind foster parents, and was soon seated in the cabin of the ship that was to convey him to an asylum on the shores of Europe.
