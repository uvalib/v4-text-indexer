      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Much has been said and done in the cause of Temperance, and for the reformation of those who have swerved from its dictates. Yet there is still a strong tide to stem, and a great work to achieve. Are the female sex fully aware of their duties in this matter? Too many of them have, indeed, felt the miseries of a desecrated fireside, and the transformation of the natural protector of themselves and their children into a frenzied foe. Peopled prisons, and blood upon the hearth-stone, have brought into prominence before the public eye, that fearful intemperance from which such sufferings flow. It has been repeatedly asked, if females are prepared to render all the aid in their power for the suppression of a crime which peculiarly threatens their most sacred interests. What is the nature of the power that they may command? Does it not consist principally in home-influences? In preventives,—in pencil-traces on the tender mind,—when it “turneth as wax to the seal?” Is not the structure of domestic life committed to their care? And are not the seeds of the evil we contemplate sometimes sown at the household board, in the example of those who hold the reins of authority, or the talisman of love? Ought not the foundation of self-control to be laid in the early habits of unfolding character? Is abstinence from the intoxicating cup, the whole of temperance? Is it wise to pamper all the appetites, and then expect the entire subjection of one? Is it safe to wait until that one has become perverted, and then wage against it a painful, doubtful warfare? Women, by the courtesy of modern times, have been styled the educating sex. High honor and deep responsibility dwell with such a name. Should not the whole of education teach the danger of self-indulgence, and the excellence of intellectual enjoyments? While it recognizes the kindness of the Great Former of the body, in attaching pleasure to the appetites by which it is nourished, will it fail to expose the ingratitude and madness of putting in jeopardy through their excess, not only the welfare of the body, but the life of the soul? What then is the aid that woman can most fitly lend to the noble science of being “temperate in all things?” Not the assumption of masculine energies, not the applause of popular assemblies; but the still, small voice singing at the cradle-side,—the prayerful sigh, that cries where seraphs veil their faces. So may she steadfastly co-operate with the blessed agencies that work around her, till, from the sanctuary of every home, shall go forth a pure streamlet to make glad the green vales of her native land, and to praise the Lord of the harvest. Hartford, Connecticut, October 1st, 1847.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1* WATER-DROPS. BY MRS. L. H. SIGOURNEY. THE TWINS. “We with our needles fashion'd the same flower; Both wrought one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbled the same song,—both in one key,— As if our hands, our hearts, voices and minds, Had been incorporate.” Shakspeare. In the environs of one of the large towns of New-England, a pleasant dwelling attracted the eye of the traveller. It was a kind of Gothic cottage, whose face of brown stucco, and pointed windows, were adorned with clustering vines. Its lawn of green turf was smoothly shaven, while occasional borders, and circles of dark, weedless mould, gave nutriment to a multitude of flowers. The angles formed by the building were wrapped in shrubbery; the damask-rose and syringas mingled their fragrance, and the corcoris-japonica waved its globes of gold. To the slight columns clung the climbing rose and the graceful American ivy, while near the well in the background, a dense willow, nourished by perpetual moisture, ever drank, and drooped. The inclosure was a deep hedge of lilacs, in whose rich spikes of flowers the white and purple alternated. At the gate, a lofty elm stood sentinel, towering upwards, whence its strength came, and dispensing from its gnarled wide-spread arms, protection and shade. Such was the rural haunt, amid the luxuriance of favoring seasons, while here and there an evergreen, skilfully disposed, provided with a wise foresight for the nakedness of winter. This abode of simple elegance was furnished with reference both to comfort and taste. The interior was in harmony with its outer robes. With no pretensions to ostentation, it had yet one treasure that neither wealth could purchase, nor soulless nature in its proudest glory boast—twin-sister babes, alike, and exceedingly beautiful. As they lay asleep in their double-headed cradle, one polished brow seemed a reflection of the other. The smile of waking innocence gave the same curve to their ruby lips, and revealed the first pearly teeth, seemingly formed in the same mould. Placed in the verandah on some fine summer's day, in their little cushioned car, the shrill song of surrounding birds brought to their large, blue eyes, the same sweet wonder; and two pair of tiny hands were clapped with one impulse of delight, at the nurse who danced before them. Side by side, their round feet patted about the nursery, and with their arms around each other, they learned to balance their timid, yet eager steps, when permitted to tread on the green turf, like newly-fledged birdlings, at “their first flight from the cage.” Together they learned to shape their infantine articulations, and thrilling was the melody of the word “mamma,” to the fond heart that responded to those sweetly blended tones. No wonder that gentle mother regarded those exquisite beings, with a tenderness bordering on idolatry. To watch the hourly development of her twin rose-buds, the color and cluster of each incipient curl, their features quickening as the dawn of intellect advanced, the verisimilitude in form and movement that deceived other eyes, and almost bewildered her own, was an “over-payment of delight.” Her extreme solicitude during the ills incidental to infancy, was rendered more agonizing, from the circumstance that they were the sole survivors of several dear ones, who had entered this fair and changeful existence, only to take a sudden farewell. The father, whose manners had been roughened by a life-long intercourse with the boisterous sea, where he had passed every grade, from cabin-boy to the command of a princely vessel, found his whole nature breathed upon, and softened, by the influence of this double paternity. As he glided over the rushing waves, he counted the days and hours that must divide him from that home, which was as the light-house to the storm-driven mariner, the “star of hope on life's tremulous ocean.” Those fairy forms hovered around him in their exceeding beauty, as living pictures on the crested billow, and amid the hoarsest roar of the tempest, their tones lingered in his heart, like the murmur of the Zenaida dove. His periods of return were signalized by lavish gifts to them, and to their mother. With the liberality natural to his profession, the most hard-earned gains were valued but as the means of their happiness. He studied the unspoken wishes of his wife, and knowing her delight in the beauties of nature, strove to make her habitation and surrounding grounds more and more of a paradise. She often endeavored to temper his profusion by a wise regard for the future; but he deemed this free expenditure a legitimate expression of his love, and gloried in its exercise. As Rosa and Lilian sprang from infancy to childhood, it was sweet to see them clasping with their delicate hands his large brown fingers, and leading him with hurried steps to their own little garden; or seated at close of day, with their white arms entwining his neck, and their pure, polished cheeks resting on his bronzed brow. Childhood advanced, and two lovely creatures might be seen, wending their way to school. Always together, arm in arm, or hand linked to hand, always attired alike, it would even seem that each golden curl, clustering around their ivory necks, had been trained by careful nature to observe the same rule of equity. Side by side, they pursued the same studies. If there was difficulty in the task, they assisted each other; if reward, they were joint partakers. Thus, they grew together, in the words of the bard of Avon. “Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet an union in partition.” They bent over one page, they wrought out the same problem, their pencils tinted the same landscape, their piano breathed in duets; they had no idea of a separate employment, or a solitary joy. In all the pursuits of knowledge, and toils of education, they put forth a double strength, through this perfected sympathy. When the pleasant season of school-day intercourse was over, and they gracefully assumed those lighter domestic cares, which were to relieve a mother in her delicate health, they were still kindred-hearted, lighting up the habitation with a double smile; their voices, like a music-tone, always in unison. Whatever they performed was with the whole, cheerful heart; and their surpassing beauty was heightened by this happy development of feminine character and duty. Thus glided away nineteen cloudless years,—and then the trouble came. Like the thunder-bolt, and the sweeping rain, fell the stroke of orphanage. Shipwreck buried the father in the deep, and the stricken wife, enfeebled by previous disease, was nable to brave the sudden shock of so fearful a sorrow. She lingered a few weeks, and sank beneath the clods of the valley. Alas, for Rosa and Lilian! Ever near the couch of the sufferer, rendering every service that affection could prompt, by night or day, while breath remained,—they wished, in the first bitterness of grief, to be gathered into her bosom, and sleep beside her, where the weary are at rest. But as time slowly unveiled his healing influences, the power of entire sympathy to soothe sorrow, became also apparent. Communion in grief dispelled the rankling anguish, and softened it into that tender melancholy which is the nurse of holy thought. The seasons, weighed down by affliction, moved heavily. Yet gradually the bereaved ones resumed an interest in their daily duties, and in the soothing intercourse of friendship and benevolence. Hitherto, their existence had known no undivided thought, or reserved sentiment. The period had come, when this peculiar and entire union was to be modified. Love ventured on the experiment. With his usual arrogance he entered the sanctuary, with his train of dreams and fancies, and hung up his own effigy in its most sacred shrine. A youth, of an impulsive and wild character, drew nearer and nearer to his own heart, one of those recluse and contemplative beings. It would seem that opposites had so combined, as to form an attachment of rare fervor and effervescence. The forsaken sister learned by degrees the hard lesson, that another was preferred to herself. She could not but perceive that her presence was an interruption to the lovers, and that the bosom so long exclusively her own, had admitted a guest which could tolerate no rival. She arraigned her own selfishness, and condemned it. She desired to rejoice in her sister's new happiness—if happiness it was. Yet to her it seemed rather as a passionate excitement, awakened by an uncongenial,—possibly an unworthy object, and she wept her first, lonely tears. One evening, she sate long in the recess of her window, to which the white rose had climbed, looking in, with her countless family of young buds, like a curious and familiar friend. The rich moonlight lay like a curtain upon dale and hillock, touching the masses of foliage with enchantment, and making every leaf that quivered in loneliness, transparent. From a lower apartment came the voices of the lovers, sometimes interrupted, sometimes in recitative; one rapid and exulting, the other tender as the murmur of the stock-dove. It was late ere Rosa entered the chamber. Then, she folded her waiting sister in a close embrace. “Oh Lilian, Lilian, forgive me. It is not now with us as in times past, and the fault is mine. When Arthur's footstep is heard, I forget all beside. When he speaks, I hear no other sound. When he is gone, his words keep possession, and his image lingers, shutting out all surrounding things. At morn I awake, and his name is first in my prayer, then yours, then my own. Methinks my soul hath escaped, and his hath taken its place.” She paused, in the rush of emotion, and bowed her flushed cheek to that of her sister, and held her breath to listen, but there was no reply. “Lilian, sometimes, since this has come upon me, you have spoken and I have not answered, or I fear me, have answered amiss. Your voice put to flight trains of thought, that were like ladders of roses, where angels descended. Is it my weakness, Lilian? or a new strength which has been revealed in me? I feel that it can never be again with us, as in the days that were, when only your arm was around me, on the cradle-pillow, and at our mother's grave. Sometimes I feel a pang, as if I had forsaken you. And yet, I repent not. Ah! how can I make reparation to you,—so long my other self?” Lilian raised her face from the fair neck of her sister, where she had hidden it, their tresses of pale gold intermingling like tendrils from the same vine. It was pale, but of a saintly mildness, for the struggle was past. “So it must be,—so it ought to be. If you are to walk with Arthur, the path of this checkered life, it is fitting that he be henceforth your more than sister, and your next to God. If I have ever repined, when you seemed first to put me from you, that is past. Selfish and sinful should I indeed be, if your happiness were not my own. But are you assured that this new path leadeth to happiness? that this guide unto death, is wisely chosen?” “Lilian!” and there was a solemnity in her tone, deepening almost to sternness, “Lilian, such a doubt you have before spoken. Let it be uttered no more. For henceforth, where he goeth, will I go; and where he dieth, will I be buried; his people shall be my people, and his God my God,—yea! if he have no God, I will have none also.” The listening sister shuddered, but spoke not. She knelt long in her accustomed orison, and laid herself down by Rosa's side, but that night she slept not. It was deemed expedient by the friends of Arthur, that he should pass a year at the south, in the prosecution of some important business, ere the completion of his marriage. The parting of the lovers was trying, and tumultuous with emotion. Perpetual and diffuse epistles seemed their only relief. “Oh Lilian! dearest, here is the most perfect letter from the adored. Listen, while I read a few passages. And yet I can more rapidly tell you its purport. We must go to him.” “Go to him!” “Yes, Lilian, yes. He is so miserable. He cannot survive longer alone. He is pining away at heart.” “He has been absent nearly half his probation. Think, in a few months he will return. It is improper, and impossible for us to go to him.” “Call nothing impossible, that Love wills. His business will probably detain him another year. Let me write, and give him permission to come on for us. Let me say that we will accompany him back, and make his wilderness an Eden.” “Rosa, my sister, write him to be patient. You surely cannot be serious?” “Lilian, you must not so love this abode, and the flowers that you are forever training. Arthur will find us a home equally beautiful at the sunny south. I take no pleasure in the things that I once thought so beautiful, for how can I be happy, while he is an exile and desolate.” It was touching to see the twin-hearts, which but one passion had ever separated, still soothing each other, and striving to harmonize their widely diverging sentiments. Like a stream suddenly parted, one was rushing on, under the sparkling sunbeam, it knew not whither; the other turning, in sadness, back to the shaded fountain where they were as one. But in all their communion, it became more evident that one, through the infusion of an earthly love, was becoming troubled and wayward; while the other sought to be a humble student of that which is divine. A letter, with a black seal. It was in the hand of the venerable Pastor who had laid their mother in the grave, and regarded with christian tenderness her orphan dear ones. His step was slow, and his voice hesitating, as he inquired for Lilian. “Yes, and for Rosa too,” said a merry voice, as a fair, young creature bounded in beside him. So hasty, beautiful being, to drink the dregs of bitterness! They might, perchance, have been softened for thee, by oozing through the crucible of thy kindred heart. Ha! raise her there, from the deadly swoon. Bend over her, sister-spirit. Lift up thy soul in prayer, thou pitying man of God. See, the water revives her. But with piercing shrieks, and hands clasped in spasms, she faints again. Oh misery! Days and nights pass. And the only sound from those pale lips, that darkened chamber, is the frantic cry, “He is dead,—dead.” Yes. He had fallen in a duel, spurred on by sudden wrath, and the wine-frenzy. Months fled, and at length the physical strength of the bereaved one triumphed. She came forth once more, but how changed. The wrinkle of despair was on her brow. She had suffered, but not submitted. He, who had taken away the idol, was to her, as a foe. On the sympathizing sister it would seem that the burden of years had been suddenly laid. Every trace of color had faded from cheek and lip. Harrowing anxiety had absorbed every feeling of her nature, except that which communed in devotion with her Father above. A childlike spirit spoke from the pale brow, which was continually turned in watchful tenderness to one, that, clouded and darkened, evinced little reciprocity, and no resignation. “Rosa, dearest, hear the birds, how they pour out the very soul of melody. Or shall I sing for you, one of those simple airs that we used to play together?” “There was, for me, but one voice of music. It is silenced, and I am deaf to melody.” “Oh, look to God. He hath comfort for the sorrow-stricken.” “Was it not He who smote down my heart's only prop? And say you, He hath comfort to offer? He hath taken away the lone star by which I steered. The taper that I held ever in my hand, is dashed into darkness. Are the glories of his own Heaven the brighter?” Poor Lilian shrank away at her words. Madness, and the spirit of defiance seemed to have been the fruit of her chastisement. More widely than ever apart, flowed the stream of life of the two lone sisters, who at first, like kindred drops, were mingled into one. “Our good Pastor has waited long for you, this morning, dear Rosa. He has been often here to inquire for you since you have been able to leave your room. Will you not see him now?” “Excuse me to him. I am not in spirits for conversation.” “He will surely expect an interview. His interest in the departed, as well as in us, require this attention.” Crimson flashed over the face of Rosa, dyeing her forehead, even to the roots of the golden hair. “Interest in the departed! If by this, you mean in Arthur, I know that he rebuked him, and that he never forgave him. Neither will I.” “His warning was in kindness. He feared”— “Nay, he numbered him with riotous drinkers of wine. And what if he was? Whoever lifted against him, the voice of blame, I hate. Rather would I be a partaker of his fault, who was as my own soul, than in their pride of sanctity, who frowned upon him.” Her tones, and gestures, her excited and unfeminine manner, shocked the meek-hearted sister. But alas! they announced no discovery. Her participation in the frailty of her fallen lover, was already written on her brow. Years slowly departed, and many comforts vanished from the habitation of the sisters. Their table was less bountiful. The waiter was dismissed, and the gardener who had so long tended those beautiful grounds, once the parents' pride. In their place, wrought a gentle being, somewhat bowed by time, but more by sorrow. In the illnesses of Rosa, she was also the nurse. And the post was no sinecure. Her forbearance, her watchfulness, the self-denying spirit which says “thy will be done,” were but in too frequent requisition. Lightly as a dream she glided about, though in her heart was a rankling arrow. She fain would have hidden her wound, and its anguish. She flattered herself that it was a secret. Alas! “Mistress Lilian,” said the old servant, the only one whom they retained, “you are so pale, and eat so little. But to be sure, there is not much to tempt your appetite, nowadays. I'm often thinking of the good old times, when my master came home from sea, and the chinaoranges were as plenty as blackberries, and the pineapples, and the tamarinds, and the chickens. Mercy on me, I think I could dress such a dinner as you would eat, if I had but the things. Sad changes I 've seen in my day, Mistress Lilian.” “We must expect changes, you know, if we live long in a changing world.” “And why do ye wear that poor, threadbare gown and hood, that look as if they came out of the ark. What would the lady, my old mistress, have said, could she have lived to see this day,—she who would always have you dressed in the best, from your cradle?” “I have little need to dress now, I go out so seldom. Besides, I have told you that we are not able to afford what we once could.” “Oh! but ye 're always able to save something for the poor. And wherefore is it that you cannot afford yourself the comforts you 've been used to, so feeble as you be, and needing them so much. Ah, wherefore, Miss Lilian? And wherefore is it that so much strong drink goes to yonder chamber? I would there were fewer full decanters and more food.” And the faithful creature wept as if her heart would break. “It is not for myself that I care, Miss Lilian, it is not for myself. But when I hear the continual call for what 2 does harm, and you working and waiting from morning till night, so loving and so patient, like a very angel, never giving a cross look to them that's destroying you, and trying all the time to hide the sword in your vitals, I cry, when I ought to sleep.” Midnight, in the chamber of the twin-sisters. And a fearful, invisible form was there also, whose shaft is never launched in vain. There were wild gaspings for breath, groans and snatches of lethargic slumber. Then a voice of piercing entreaty, thrilling and tender as a quivering harp-string. “Oh! look to Him, who forgiveth all sin. Turn to the Lamb of God. Rosa! Rosa! pray!” And from the old gray-haired servant, burst forth a cry, “Pray! pray!” A slow opening of the glassy eyes. They seemed to regard nothing distinctly. Then the heavy lids closed, to be lifted no more. “Sister! say, with me, Jesus! Saviour! have mercy on me.” There was no reply. “Press my hand, beloved! if you think of the blessed Redeemer.” No movement. The lips of the living were joined to those that were to speak no more. Long was that last kiss, but unreturned. There was a horror of deep anguish, when those twin-souls parted. The lonely-hearted knelt beside the couch of the loved and lost. She laid her face on the marble bosom. Sobs were heard, and a low voice of supplication. Then all was still. Morning dawned, and they would fain raise the mourner who knelt there so long. They would fain have raised her,—but their hands clasped a form of marble. The chastened and peaceful spirit had gone home. And the bitter weeping of the old, white-haired servant, alone broke the silence of the death-chamber.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">APPLES OF SODOM. “Oh! what is life thus spent? and what are they But frantic, who thus spend it?” Cowper. The heir of a noble house grew up to manhood. His person was lofty, and his step commanding and proud. He had been nurtured in halls of learning, and all that wealth could lend to intellect was his. He dwelt in a stately mansion, and many waited for his smile. In his ample library, were gathered the wisdom of ancient sages, and the varied knowledge of modern times. Tomes, enriched by the skill of the engraver, and gay in silk and gold, strewed his tables. There he sometimes lingered, till the lamps grew pale, and the fire in his burnished grate faded. But, as he sate in his deep chair of velvet, with his feet upon an embroidered ottoman, he sometimes dozed over the open page. For a wine-cup was beside him there. Once he read, from a classic book, of the apples of Sodom. But deep sleep came upon him, and falling, he lay upon the rich carpet. His servants bore him to his 2* couch, and when his head sank in the deep, down pillow, he murmured something like “Apples of Sodom.” Afterwards, when he slept long among the books, or his feet failed in the hall, and they laid him in his bed, as one without strength, they said to each other, “Our master hath eaten the apples of Sodom.” But beyond this, they spake not, for they loved the heir of that ancient house where they had so long been fed. A fair, young creature was seen in the lofty rooms of that princely abode. At her word, the marble vases glowed with fresh flowers, and guests, robed in rich apparel, gathered round the costly board. At her word, the steeds moved gracefully in the proud chariot, for she bore over that household the authority of a wife. Yet was there something at her heart, that gnawed like a secret worm. Of this, she spake not. But the green leaves of hope withered, and the garlands of joy. She lay upon a silken couch. Perfumes breathed around her. The light of the silver lamp was shaded by the heavy folds of silken curtains, and the steps gliding around her, upon the thick, and radiant carpet, gave no sound. Then the wail of a weak infant was heard,—and the soul of the young mother departed. The master of the mansion wept; but with his tears were drops of wine. The holy fruits of sorrow he gathered not, for in his hand were the apples of Sodom. Yet the little feet of the child at his side, made music in his heart, and he saw with pride that the dark curls round the pure forehead were like his own. The boy grew in strength and in beauty. His heart reached out slight tendrils for something to love, and took hold both of the evil and the good. Ere the eyes of the mind were fully opened, the quick passions had put forth broad, dark leaves to drink up the sunbeams. When he erred, and deserved reproof, or when he did well, and needed encouragement, there was no father, save a bloated form in the wine-trance. He became a youth, and flattery spake to him soft things. At his nod, servants went and came, and when his splendid equipage rolled along the pavement, the gazing crowd said that he was happy. But they knew not, that for the undisciplined spirit there is no happiness. Years rolled on. And in the house of strangers, whence issued wild shrieks, and exulting shouts without cause, and the loud laughter of the maniac, was the son of the drunkard. Bolts and bars restrained him, and the glory of his clustering locks was shorn. He raved wildly, calling his servants to his aid, and uttering maledictions because they came not. At intervals, he was quiet, and wrote upon the walls of his cell, incoherent thoughts. There, amid broken and blotted lines, might be traced out, “Apples of Sodom.” The father sate in his lonely halls. He scarcely mourned for his lost son. An equal madness was upon him, and a greater sin; for they were voluntary. The habit, which like a tyrant ruled him, and been his own choice. He had himself forged the chains, that were dragging him to the lowest hell. He sate in his lonely halls. Friends had forsaken him, for he had shown kindness to none. The white hairs of age were upon him, yet had he not become wise. Wealth was still his, but he enjoyed it not. Neither gave he to the poor, for a depraved appetite had eaten up his sympathies. The weakness of age came upon him. He was a driveller, and full of disease. His old servants were dead, and the new mocked him, and stole his substance. His dim eyes discovered not their thefts, but he trusted them not, and dwelt with them as among enemies. None pitied him, or said, “Poor old man!” for his vice had made him an abhorrence. Memory fled away; so that the names of his wife, or child, woke no image in his soul. Yet he forgot not the wine-cup. There it stood, ever near him, and he drowned in it the last light of life. He died. And the bloated corpse scarce retained the form of humanity. They bore him to his tomb, with the pomp of mourning; with steeds slowly pacing, and nodding their sable plumes: for he was the heir of a noble house. Yet, in that long procession, none remembered aught that he had done for the comfort of the sorrowful, or to cause his name to be gratefully remembered among men. They laid down the dead, in the tomb with his fathers. And methought, from their coffins issued a hollow voice, “Strength was thine, and manly beauty; wealth, and learning, and love, and the joys of paternity; length of days, and all that the world covets. “Yet hast thou come unto us as with the burial of a beast, for whom none weepeth. Yea, thou didst choose to pare the Apples of Sodom, and feed on their ashes all the days of thy life. So hast thou found bitterness at the latter end.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“ONLY THIS ONCE.” Numbers x. 17. “Only this once:” the wine-cup glowed, All sparkling with its ruby ray, The bacchanalian revel flowed, And Folly made the madness gay. Then he, so oft, so deeply warned, The sway of conscience rashly spurned, His promise of repentance scorned, And coward-like, to guilt returned. “Only this once:” the tale is told, He wildly quaff'd the poisonous tide; With more than Esau's frenzy sold The birth-right of his soul, and died. I do not say that breath forsook The clay, and left his pulses dead, But Reason in her empire shook, And all the life of life was fled. Then angel eyes with pity wept, When he, whom Virtue fain would save, His sacred vow so falsely kept, And strangely chose a drunkard's grave. “Only this once:” Beware! beware! Gaze not upon the blushing wine; Repel temptation's siren snare, And prayerful seek for strength divine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEATH'S CHOICE. The shadowy monarch, on his throne of skulls, Sate, wearied and displeased. “My cheerless task Since he of Eden felt a brother's hate,” Down to the brow that blanches as I speak, Hath known no respite. Would that there were one With whom to trust my cares awhile, and snatch One moment of repose. Ho! ye who wait! Give notice that with him most worthy found By previous deeds, to waste the race of man, The King of Terrors will delight to share The glory of his kingdom.” Mighty winds, Swollen high to earthquake violence, and tones Of many waters, like wild, warring seas, Proclaimed the edict, while the lightning's spear Wrote it in flame on every winged cloud: Yea, with such zeal the elements conspired To publish the decree, methought there lurked In each, some latent, lingering hope, to win The promised regency. The Passions came, Throned on their storm-clouds, and with varied voice Thundering, or eloquent, as best beseemed Their several natures, boasted how to quell Life's feeble springs. But to their claims, stern Death Gave credence cold. Next, fleshless Famine stalked, Followed by fierce, unpitying Pestilence, Still ever in their ear a mournful sound,— The weeping of the nations. Loudly shriek'd A martial trump, and on his bannered car, War, like a sovereign, came. Unnumbered spoils Were strewed around him, and the blood of men Flowed, as a river, 'neath his chariot wheels. His eagle eye the promised honor scanned, As an undoubted right. But still pale Death Pondered and spake not, till, with haughty pride The candidate withdrew, and trembling Earth Shrank at his kindled wrath. There was a pause, As if none dare in that foiled champion's steps Essay to tread. At length, a bloated form Moved slowly on, with mixed and maddening bowl. But ere the footstool of the throne he pressed, Death, with a father's fondness hasting down, Embraced, and in the seat of empire placed. Great was the wonder, but none dare gainsay:— For with a fearful shout, all Nature's foes, Diseases, passions, wars and sins, confessed Intemperance their king, and at his feet Their boasted, time-cemented trophies, cast.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE WIDOW AND HER SON. “Care, and peril, instead of joy,— Guilt and dread shall be thine, rash boy. Lo! thy mantling chalice of life Foameth with sorrow, and madness, and strife. It is well. I discern a tear on thy cheek,— It is well. Thou art humble, and silent, and meek. Now, courage again! and with peril to cope, Gird thee with vigor, and helm thee with hope. Martin Farquhar Tupper. A group of villagers surrounded an open grave. A woman, holding two young children by the hand, was bowed down with grief. There seemed to be no other immediate mourners. But many an eye turned on them with sympathy, and more than one glistened with tears. In a small, rural community, every death is felt as a solemn thing, and in some measure, a general loss. The circumstances that attended it, are inquired into, and remembered; while, in cities, the frequent hearse scarce gains a glance, or a thought, from the passing throng. On this occasion it was distinctly known, that Mr. Jones, the carpenter of the village, who was that day buried, had led a reproachless life, and that his death, by sudden disease, in the prime of his days, would be an unspeakable loss to his wife, and little ones. Pitying kindness stirred in the hearts of those honest people, and whatever service their limited means allowed, was promptly rendered. It was the earnest desire of the widow, to keep, if possible, the cottage where they had resided since their marriage; and which was the more dear, from having been built by the hands of her husband. They respected her diligence and prudence, and at their seasons of fruit-gathering and harvest she was not forgotten. But as her health, which had been worn down by watching and sorrow, returned, her energies also were quickened to labor, that she might bring up her children without the aid of charity: and her efforts were prospered. In the course of a few years, it was thought advisable for her daughter, who was ingenious with the needle, to go to a neighboring town and obtain instruction in the trade of a dressmaker. Richard, who was two years younger, remained with his mother, attending in winter the village-school, and at other periods of the year, finding occasional employment among the farmers in the vicinity. It was seen by all, how much the widow's heart was bound up in him, and how she was always devising means for his improvement and happiness. But as Richard grew older, he liked the society of idle boys, and it was feared did not fully appreciate, or repay her affection. He was known to be addicted to his own way, and had been heard to express contempt for the authority of women. There were rumors of his having frequented places where liquors were sold; yet none imagined the disobedience and disrespect which that lonely cottage sometimes witnessed, for the mother complained only to her God, in the low sigh of prayer. She was not able to break his intimacy with evil associates, and, ere he reached his eighteenth year, had too much reason to believe him a partaker in their vices. It was supposed that she was unacquainted with his conduct, because she spoke not of it to others, and continued to treat him with tenderness. But deep Love, though sometimes willing to appear blind, is quick-sighted to the faults of its object. It may keep silence, but the glance of discovery, and the thrill of torture, are alike electric. The widowed mother had hoped much from the return of her daughter, and the aid of her young, cheerful spirit, in rendering their home attractive. Her arrival, in full possession of her trade, with the approbation of her employers, gave to her lone heart a joy long untasted. Margaret was an active and loving girl, graceful in her person, and faithful to every duty. Her industry provided new comforts for the cottage, while her innocent gayety enlivened it. The widowed mother earnestly besought her assistance, in saving their endangered one from the perils that surrounded him; and her sisterly love poured itself out upon his heart, in a full, warm flood. It would seem that he caught the enthusiasm of her example; for he returned with more of diligence to his former labors, while his intervals of leisure were spent at home. When his mother saw him seated by their pleasant little hearth, sometimes reading to Margaret, while she plied the needle, or occasionally winding her silks, and arranging the spools in her work-table, their young voices mingling in song, or laughter, she felt how powerful was the influence of a good sister, and lifted up her soul in praise to the Rock of their salvation. Somewhat more of filial respect and observance she might have desired, but was content that her own claims should be overlooked, might he only be rescued. Months fled, and her pallid cheek had already resumed the tinge of a long-forgotten happiness. One day, when spring made the earth beautiful, on entering suddenly Margaret's little chamber, she surprised her in a passion of tears. “My daughter! My dear child!” “Oh, mother! I wish you had not come, just now.” “Tell me, are you sick?” “No, not sick. Only my heart is broken.” “Can you not trust me with your trouble?” Long and bursting sobs followed, with stifled attempts at utterance. “Mother, we have been so happy, I cannot bear to destroy it all. Richard,—my poor brother.” “Speak! what has he done?” Hiding her face in her mother's bosom, she said in broken tones,— “You ought to know,—I must tell you. It cannot longer be concealed that he often comes home late, and disguised with liquor. I tried to shut out the truth from myself. Then I tried to hide it from others. But it is all in vain.” “Alas! I thought he was changed, that your blessed hand had saved him. Tell me what you have discovered.” “I would fain spare you. But I have seen enough, for weeks past, to destroy my peace. Last night, you had retired before he came. He entered with a reeling step, and coarse, hateful words. I strove to get him silently to his bed, lest he might disturb you. But he withstood me. His fair blue eyes were like balls of fire; and he cursed me, till I fled from him.” The mother clasped her closer to her heart, and bathed her brow with tears. “Look to Him, my child, who ordereth all our trials. Night after night, have I spent in sleepless prayer for the poor, sinful boy.” “Ah! then you have known it long. Mother, you have been too indulgent. You should warn and reprove him, and give him no rest, until he repent and forsake his sin.” “All that was in my power to do, has been faithfully done. I have not spared him. But he revolted. He 3 despised my woman's voice, my motherly love. I forbore to distress your young heart with all that I might have revealed. I feared to damp the courage on which my hopes were built. I told you freely of his danger from evil associates, but relied on the power of your love too much, too fondly. Yet you have been an angel to him, and to me.” “Mother, I will myself rebuke him. I will speak for you, and for God.” “Margaret, may He give you wisdom. Should your brother's mind not be in a right state, your words will be hurled back upon your own head. Sometimes, I have poured out my whole soul in reproof. Then, again, I have refrained, to save him from the sin of cursing his mother. Yet speak to him, Margaret, if you will. May God give power to your words. Still, I cannot but fear lest you take a wrong time, when his feelings are inflamed with intemperance.” “Be at peace, in this, dearest mother, I will not broach such a subject but at a fitting time.” The mother had little hope from the intended appeal of her daughter. Indeed, she shrank from it, for she best knew the temper of her son. Yet she humbled herself to go to the vender of liquor, and beseech him to withhold it from him, in the name of the widow's God. Margaret drooped in secret, but spoke cheering words to her brother, with an unclouded brow. One day, he had aided her in some slight operation in the garden, with unwonted kindness. She fancied that she saw in his eye, the reviving spirit of better days. Throwing her arm around his neck, she said,— “Brother Richard, you can be so good. How I wish it were always thus.” “Always to be working under your orders, I suppose. No doubt, that would be quite pleasing. All you women like to rule, when you can.” “Not to rule, but to see those we love rule themselves.” “Is that what you tell Will Palmer, when he sits here so long, watching you like a cat, and looking as wise as an owl? If you should chance to marry him, you'd tell him another tale, and try all ways to rule him yourself. Now, Miss Mag Jones, tell the whole truth: why is that same deacon that is to be, here forever?” “I will not hide anything from you, dear Richard, who have known my thoughts from my cradle. We shall probably be married in the autumn, and then”— “And then, what?” “Oh, brother! then, I hope you will do all in your power to comfort mother, when I shall not be here.” “Not be here! Do you expect to move to Oregon, or sit on the top of the Andes, with this remarkable sweetheart of yours?” “We shall not leave this village. But when I have a new home and other duties, I hope you will be daughter and son both, to our poor mother. Remember how hard she has worked to bring us up, how she has watched us in sickness, and prayed for us, at all times. Her only earthly hope is in us; especially in you, her son.” “Margaret, what are you driving at?” “Oh, Richard! forsake those evil associates, who are leading you to ruin. Break off the habit of drinking, that debases, and destroys you. For the sake of our widowed mother, for the sake of our father's unblemished memory, for the sake of the sister, who loves you as her own soul”— “For the sake of what else? Bill Palmer, I presume. Is there never to be an end to these women's tongues? So it has been these three years; preach, preach, till I have prayed for deafness. I have had no rest, for Mrs. Jones's eternal sermons; and now you must needs come to help her, with your everlasting gab.” The young girl heeded not that his eyes flashed, and that the veins of his neck were swollen and sanguine. Throwing off the timidity of her nature, she spoke slowly, and with solemn emphasis, as one inspired. “If you have no pity on the mother who bore you, no tender memory of the father who laid his hands on your head, when they were cold in death; no regard for an honest, honorable reputation; at least, have some pity on your own undying soul, some fear of the bar of judgment, of the worm that never dies, and seek mercy while there is hope, and repent, that you may be forgiven.” “I tell you what, I'll not bear this from you. I know something to make fine words out of, too. Your mother has been slandering me, prohibiting the traffic in liquor, I understand: for aught I know, you were her spokesman. Wise women! as if there was but one place on this round world, where it is sold. Hypocrites you are, both of you! making boast of your love, and publishing evil against me. Look out, how you drive a man to desperation. If you see my face no more, thank yourselves!” And with a hoarse imprecation, he threw himself over the garden fence, and disappeared. That night there was agonizing grief in the pleasant cottage, tears, and listening for the feet that came not. Then, were days of vain search, and harrowing anxiety, closed by sleepless watchings. Alas! for the poor mother's heart! What had the boy been left to do? what! Had not his sister been too severe? Would that her reproaches had been less sharp to his sore heart, or that she had taken a better time, when he might have been more patient. Thus travailed the yearning heart of the mother, with the old, blind Eden-policy, vain excuse. Again another tide of struggling emotion. Would he but come, even as he had so often done, with unequal steps, and muttered threatenings. Would he only come, that the Love which had nursed his innocent infancy, might once more look upon his face. Then swept terrible thoughts over the mother's soul, images of reckless crime, and ghastly suicide. But she gave them not utterance to the daughter who sate beside her, working and weeping. For she said, the burden of the child is already greater than she can bear. Yet he, who was the cause of all this agony, hastened night and day from the quiet spot of his birth, towards the sea-coast, boiling with passion. He conceived himself to have been utterly disgraced by the prohibition of his mother to the seller of liquors, not feeling that the disgrace was in the sin that had made such prohibition necessary. He wildly counted those who most loved him, as conspirators against his peace; for vice, to its other distortions of soul, adds the insanity of mistaking the best friends for enemies. Full of vengeful purpose, and knowing that his mother had long dreaded lest he should choose the life of a sailor, he hurried to a seaport, and shipped on a whaling voyage. As the vessel was to sail immediately, to be absent more than three years, and he entered under a feigned name, it gave him pleasure that he should thus baffle pursuit or discovery. “Let them trace me, if they can,” said he; “and when I get back, I'll sail again, without seeing them. They may preach now as long as they please, but I'll be out of their hearing.” Thus, in the madness of a sinful heart, he threw himself upon the great deep, without a thought of kindness towards man, or a prayer to God. Yet he was ill-prepared for the lot of hardship he had chosen,—the coarse fare, the iron sway, the long night-watch, and the slippery shroud in the tempest. To drown misery in the daily allowance of liquor, was his principal resource, when at first the sea-sickness seized him, and afterwards, when his sea-sins sank him still lower in brutality. Vile language, bad songs, and frequent broils were the entertainments of the forecastle; while the toilsome duties of a raw sailor before the mast, were imbittered by the caprices of the captain, himself a votary of intemperance. A stronger shadowing forth of the intercourse of condemned spirits could scarcely be given, than the fierce crew of that rude vessel exhibited, shut out, for years, from all humanizing and holy influences. Yet strange to say, the recreant, who had abused the indulgences of home and the supplications of love, derived some benefit where it could least have been anticipated. Indolence was exchanged for regular employment, and he learned the new and hard lesson of submission to authority; and whenever a lawless spirit is enforced to industry, and the subjugation of its will, it must be in some degree a gainer. So, with the inconsistency of our fallen nature, the soul that had spurned the sunbeam, and hardened under the shower, was arrested by the thunderblot, and taught by the lightning. In the strong excitement and peril of conflict with the huge monarch of the deep, he gained some elevation, by a temporary forgetfulness of self; for that one image, long magnified and dilated, had closed the mind to all ennobling prospects, and generous resolves. The deadlights of the soul had been so long shut in, that the first ray that streamed through them, seemed new and wonderful. Accident and ill-fortune protracted their voyage, several months beyond its intended limits. While pursuing a homeward course, some seasons of serious reflection, when not under the sway of intemperance, came over Richard Jones. For he was not utterly hardened; and prayers continually rose up from his forsaken home, that, if yet in the land of the living, he might repent, and find hope. Conscience, at times, wrought powerfully, so that he dreaded to be alone, or turned as a refuge to the vile revelry of comrades whom he despised. Once, as he paced the deck in his midnight watch, while the vessel went rushing onward through the deep, dark sea, solemn thoughts settled heavily around him. Here, and there, a star looked down upon him, with watchful, reproving eye. He felt alone, in the presence of some mighty, mysterious Being. Early memories returned; the lessons of the Sabbath-school, the plaintive toll of the church-bell, the voice of his mother, as seated on her knee, she taught him of the dear Saviour, who took the children to his breast, and blessed them. A few drops of rain, from a passing cloud, fell upon his head. In the excitement of the reverie, he gasped,— “These are her tears! Yes! Just so they felt on my forehead, when she used to beseech me to forsake the foolish, and live, and go in the way of understanding.” He leaned over the vessel's side. The rain-drops ceased, and the phosphorescence of the waters was like a great lake of fire. The billows rose, tossing their white crests for a moment, and then sank into the burning flood. He watched them till his brain grew giddy. Presently, a single faint moonbeam shot through the cleft of a cloud. As it glimmered over the surge, he thought a face loomed up, and gazed on him,—a fair young face, paler than marble. A hand seemed to stretch itself out, arms to bend in an embracing clasp, a floating death-shroud gleamed,—and all was lost forever. “Oh, Margaret! oh, my sister!” he shrieked, “just so she looked when she adjured me, in the name of God, to have pity on my poor mother, and on my own soul.” As if he had witnessed her funeral obsequies, he wept in remorseful grief. His watch closed. In horror of spirit, he retired, but not to sleep. Even the hardened men who surrounded him forbore to jeer, when they heard him moan in anguish, “Oh, Margaret! oh, my sister!” These strong and painful impressions scarcely wore away during the brief remainder of the voyage. When he saw in dim outline, the hills of his country gleaming amid the clouds, a new joy took possession of his soul. And when his feet rested again on the solid earth, and 3* he received his wages, his first thought was to hasten and share them with those whom he had so recklessly forsaken. “Will you come to my house, sir?” said a man, upon the wharf, near him. “Good accommodations, sir, for sailor gentlemen. Everything, first cut and first cost.” “Where is your house?” “Near by. Here, boy; take this fine young man's chest along. I'll show you the way, sir. The favorite boarding-house for all jolly, noble-spirited tars.” It was evident that he was now in the power of a land-shark. Alas! for all his hopes: the struggles of conscience, the rekindling of right affections. Temptation, and the force of habit, were too strong for him. Almost continually intoxicated, his hard earnings vanished, he knew not how, or where. It was not long ere his rapacious landlord pronounced him in debt, and produced claims which he was unable to meet. His chest with all its contents was seized, and he, miserably clad, and half bewildered, was turned into the streets, by his sordid betrayer. As the fumes of prolonged inebriety subsided, horrible images surrounded him. Smothered resolutions, and pampered vices, sprang from the seething caldron of his brain, frowning and gibbering like ghostly tormentors. Monstrous creatures grinned and beckoned, and when he would have fled, cold slimy serpents seemed to coil around and fetter his trembling limbs. Still, with returning reason came a deeper misery. He desired to die, but death fled from him. Covering his face with his hands, as he sate on the ground, in the damp, chill air of evening, he meditated different forms of suicide. He would fain have plunged into the sea, but his tottering limbs failed him. Searching for his knife, the only movable that remained to him, he examined its blunted edge, and loosened blade, as if doubting their efficiency. Thus engaged, by the dim light of a street-lamp, groans, as if the pangs of death had seized him, burst from his heaving breast. Half believing himself already a dweller with condemned spirits, he started at the sound of a human voice. “Thee art in trouble, I think.” The eyes once so clear in days of innocence, opening wide and wild, glared with amazement on the calm, compassionate brow of a middle-aged man, in the garb of a Quaker. The knife fell from his quivering hand, and sounded on the pavement. But there was no answer. “Thee art in great trouble, friend!” “Friend! Friend! Who calls me friend? I have no friends, but the tormentors to whom I am going.” “Hast thou a wife? or children?” “No, no; God be thanked. No wife, nor children. I tell you there are no friends left, but the fiends who have come for me. No home, but their eternal fires. Shoals of them were here just now,—ready! aye, ready!” and he laughed a demoniac laugh. “Poor, poor youth! I see thee art a sailor.” “I was once. What I am now, I know not. I wish to be nothing. Leave me to myself, and those that are howling around me. Here! here! I come:” and he groped aimlessly for his lost knife. The heart of the philanthropist yearned as over an erring brother. The spirit of the Master who came to seek and to save the lost, moved within him. “Alas! poor victim. How many have fallen, like thee, before the strong man armed. Sick art thou, at the very soul. I will give thee shelter for the night. Come with me, to my home.” “Home! Home?” shouted the inebriate, as if he understood him not. And while the benevolent man, taking his arm, staid his uncertain footsteps, he still repeated, but in tones more humanized and tender,—“Home! your home? What! me a sinner?” until a burst of unwonted tears relieved the fires within. And as that blessed man led him to his own house, and laid him upon a good bed, speaking words of comfort; heard he not from above that deep, thrilling melody, “I was sick, and ye visited me, in prison, and ye came unto me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these, ye have done it unto me?” With reviving day the sinful man revived; humbled in heart, and sad. Subdued by suffering, and softened by a kindness, which he felt to be wholly undeserved, he poured out a fervent prayer for divine aid in the great work of reformation. He was glad to avail himself, without delay, of the proposal of his benefactor, to enter on service in a temperance ship ready to sail immediately for the East Indies. “I am acquainted with the captain,” said the good man, “and can induce him to take thee. I am also interested in the vessel, and in the results of her voyage. A relative of mine, goes out as supercargo. Both of them will be thy friends, if thou art true to thyself. But intemperance bringeth sickness to the soul, as well as to the body. Wherefore, pray for healing, and strive for penitence, and angels who rejoice over the returning sinner, will give thee aid.” Self-abasement, and gratitude to his preserver, swelled like an overwhelming flood, and choked his utterance. “All men have sinned, my son, though not all in the same way. But there is mercy for every one that sorroweth, and forsaketh the evil. God hath given me the great happiness to help some who have fallen as low as thee. Thank Him, therefore, and not the poor arm of flesh. May He give thee-strength to stand firm on the Rock of salvation.” Broken words, mingled with tears, struggled vainly to express the emotions of the departing sailor. His benefactor once more shaking him heartily by the hand, bade him farewell. “Peace be with thee, on the great waters. And remember to strive and pray.” A new world seemed to open upon the rescued one. Of the quietness and order that pervaded a temperance ship, he had no anticipation. There were neither quarrels nor profanity, so common among the crew, nor arrogance, and capricious punishment, on the part of those in power. Cheerful obedience, and just authority prevailed, as in a well-regulated family. He was both surprised and delighted to find his welfare an object of interest with the officers of the ship, to receive kind counsel from them, and to be permitted to employ his brief intervals of leisure with the well-chosen volumes of a seaman's library. Still it was not with him, as if he had never sinned. Not all at once could he respire freely in a pure atmosphere. Physical exhaustion, from the withdrawal of stimulants to which he had been long accustomed, sometimes caused such deep despondence, that life itself seemed a burden. Cherished vice brings also a degree of moral obliquity. Every permitted sin lifts a barrier between the clear shining of God's countenance, and the cold and frail human heart. Perverted trains of thought, and polluted remembrances still lingered with him, and feelings long debased, did not readily acquire an upward tendency. Yet the parting admonition of his benefactor to strive and pray, ever sounded in his ears, and became the motto of his soul. By little and little, through faithful obedience, he obtained the victory. His improvement was noticed by others, before he dared to congratulate himself; for humility had strangely become a part of his character, who once defied all laws, human and divine. His countenance began to resume the ingenuous expression of early years, and the eyes, so long fiery, or downcast, looked up with the clearness of hope. “Blessings on the temperance ship!” he often ejaculated, as he paced the deck in his nightly watch, “and eternal blessings on the holy man, who snatched me from the lowest hell.” At his arrival in a foreign port, he was watchful to avoid every temptation. His friend, the supercargo, took him under his especial charge, and finding him much better educated than is usual with sailors, gave him employment of a higher nature, which was both steady and lucrative. His expenses were regulated with extreme economy, that he might lay up more liberally for those dear ones at home, whose images became more and more vivid, as his heart threw off the debasing dominion of intemperance, and its host of evils. The returning voyage was one of unmingled satisfaction. Compunction had given place to a healthful virtue, whose root was not in himself. “Why is this?” he often soliloquized: “why should I be saved, while so many perish? How have I deserved such mercy, who willingly made a beast of myself, through the fiery draught of intemperance? Oh, my mother! I know that thy prayers have followed me,—they have saved me.” With what a surpassing beauty did the hills of his native land gleam upon his eye, unfolding before him, like angels' wings. He felt also, that an angel's mission was his to the hearts that loved him, and which he in madness had wounded. Immediately on reaching the shore, he began his journey to them. Stopping his ears to the sounds of the city, where he had once sunk so low, he hurried by its haunts of temptation, less from fear, than from sickening disgust. Autumn had ripened its fruits, without sacrificing the verdure of summer. It was the same season that, seven years before, he had traversed this region. But with what contrasted prospects, and purposes! How truly has it been said, that no two individuals can differ more from each other, than the same individual may, at different periods of life, differ from himself. Richard Jones scarcely paused on his way for sleep, or for refreshment. He sought communion with none. The food of his own thoughts sufficed. As he drew near the spot of his birth, impatience increased almost beyond endurance. The rapid wheels seemed to make no progress, and the distance to lengthen interminably. Quitting the public vehicle, which did not pass that secluded part of the village where his parental cottage was situated, he sought it in solitude. It was pleasant to him to come thus unknown, and he meditated the rapturous surprise he was about to create. Those rocks! that river! can they be the same? The roof! the very roof! and the maple that shaded it.—But the garden-fence, the gate, are broken and gone. Where is the honeysuckle that Margaret trained? He was about to lift the latch,—to burst in, as in days of old. But other thoughts came over him, and he knocked gently, as a stranger; again, more earnestly. “Who is there?” It was a broad, gruff accent. He opened the door; a large, coarse woman stood there, with sleeves rolled above her red elbows, toiling at the wash-tub. “Does the Widow Jones live here?” “The Widow who? why, Lord, no. I live here myself, to be sure.” The quivering lips, and parched tongue, scarcely articulated,— “Where is Margaret Jones?” “How should I know? I never hearn o' such a one, not I. Tho' I've been here, and hereabouts, this two year, I reckon.” A horror of great darkness fell upon the weary traveller. He turned from the door. Whither should he go? There was no neighboring house, and had there been, he would fain have hidden his misery from all who had ever known him. Instinctively he entered the burial-ground, which was near by. There was his father's grave with its modest stone, where he had been so often led in childhood. By its side was another, not fresh, yet the sods were imperfectly consolidated, and had not gathered greenness. He threw himself upon it,—he grasped a few dry weeds that grew there, and waved in the rising blast. “This is to be alone in the world! Oh God! I have deserved it; I was her murderer! but I dreamed not of such misery!” Long he lay there, in his tempestuous grief, without being sensible of a faint hollow sound, heard at regular intervals. It was the spade of the sexton, casting up earth and stones from the depth of a grave, in which he labored. Even his deaf ear caught the voice of anguish, as he finished his work. Coming forward, he stood in wonder, as if to illustrate the description of the poet: “Near to a grave that was newly made. Lean'd the sexton thin, on his earth-worn spade,— A relic of by-gone days, was he, And his locks were as white as the foam of the sea.” Starting at that withered effigy, which in the dim haze of twilight seemed more like a ghost than a man, he exclaimed,— “Did you ever hear of a middle-aged woman, called the Widow Jones?” “Hear of her! I know'd her well, and her husband too. An honest, hard-working man he was; and when he died, was well spoke of, through all this village.” “And his wife?”— “Why everybody pitied her, inasmuch as her husband died so sudden, and left leetle, or no means behind, for her and the children.” “There were children, then?” “Yes, two on 'em. She worked hard enough, to bring 'em up, I guess. I remember the funeral, as if 'twas only yesterday. I stood just about where you do now; and I used this spade, the very first time it ever was used, to dig that same grave.” With a convulsive effort, as when one plucks a dagger from his breast, he asked faintly,— “When did she die?” “Die? mercy on you! Why, I don't s'pose she's dead at all. Sure, I should have been called on to dig the grave, if she had died: that's sartain. I've had all the business of that sort, in these parts, as you may say, for this forty year, and better. There did once come a person from the North country, and try to undersell me. But he did'nt do his work thorough. His graves caved in. He couldn't get a living, and so he went off. I'll show ye one of the graves of his digging, if you'll just came along,”— “Tell me, for God's sake! if the Widow Jones still lives?” “Why, man! what's the matter on ye? you're as white as the tomb-stones. I tell ye, she's alive, for aught I know to the contrary. She moved away from here, a considerable time ago. It an't so well with her, as 'twas in days past.” Grasping the sexton strongly by the arm, he demanded,— “Where is she to be found?” “Oh Lord! help! help! the man will murder me, I verily believe. Did ye ever hear of what was called the stone-house? just at the hither eend of the next village, after you cross a bridge, and go up a hill, and turn to the right, and see a small cluster of buildings, and a mill, and a meetin'-house? Well, she lives there in a kind of a suller-room, for I was a telling you, I expect, she an't none too well off.—Goodness! the creature is gone as if he wanted to ride a streak o' lightning, and whip up. He is demented, without a doubt. What a terrible risk I've run! Deliver us from crazy men, here among the tombs. How awful my arm aches, where he clutched it.” While the garrulous sexton made his way to his own dwelling, to describe his mysterious guest, and imminent peril of life; the supposed maniac was traversing the intervening space with breathless rapidity. Lights began to glimmer from the sparsely-sprinkled dwellings. The laborers, returning from toil, took their evening repast with their families. Here and there, a blazing hearth marked the chillness of advancing autumn. Rushing onward towards a long, low building of gray stone, which appeared to have many tenants, he leaned a moment against its walls, to recover respiration, and bowing down, looked through an uncurtained window in its gloomy basement. By the flickering light of some brush-wood, burning in the chimney, he saw a woman placing the fragments of a loaf upon a table, beside which sate two young children. She was thin, and bent; but having her head turned from him, he was unable to see her features. Could that be her; so changed? Yet. the “come in,” that responded to his rap, was in a tone that thrilled his inmost soul. “Have you any food to bestow? I have travelled far, and am hungry.” “Sit down, sir, here at the table. I wish I had something better to offer you. But you are welcome to our poor fare.” And she pushed towards him the bread and the knife. He cut a slice, with a trembling hand. The youngest child, watching the movement, whispered, with a reproachful look,— “Granny! you said I should have two pieces to night, 'cause there was no dinner.” “Hush, Richard!” said the little sister, folding her arms around his neck. The returning wanderer with difficulty maintained his disguise, as he marked the deep wrinkles on that brow, which he had left so comely. “Have you only this broken loaf, my good woman? I fear the portion I have taken, will not leave enough for you and these little ones.” “We shall have more to-morrow, sir, if God will. It was not always thus with us. When my dear daughter and her husband were alive, there was always a sufficiency for the children, and for me. But they are both dead, sir; the father, last year, and she, when that boy was born.” “Had you no other children?” “Yes, sir. One, a son, a dear and most beautiful boy. Long years have passed, since he went away. Whether he is in the land of the living, God only knows.” Her suppressed sob was changed to surprise and resistance, as the stranger would fain have folded her in his arms. Then, kneeling at her feet, and holding her thin hands in his, he said,— “Mother! dear mother! can you forgive me all?” There was no reply. The sunken eyes strained wide open, and fixed. Color fled from the lips. He carried her to the poor, low bed, and threw water upon her temples. He chafed the rigid hands, and in vain sought for some restorative to administer. “Wretch that I am! Have I indeed killed her?” And then the shrieks of the children grew shrill and deafening,— “The strange man has killed grandmother!” But the trance was brief. Light came to the eye, and joy to the heart, known only to that of the mother who, having sown in tears, beholds suddenly the blessed, unexpected harvest. “Do I live to see thy face? Let me hear thy dear voice once more, my son.” But the son had vanished. At his return came supplies, such as that poor, half-subterranean apartment had never before witnessed; and ere long, with those half-famished children, they partook of a repast, whose rich elements of enjoyment have seldom been surpassed on this troubled earth. “What a good, strange man!” said the satisfied boy. “We must not call him the strange man any more, but our uncle,” said little Margaret; “so he told me himself.” “Why must we say so?” “Because he was dear mother's dear brother, just as you are mine. Did not you see that he cried, when grandmother told him she was dead?” “Well, I shall love him for that, and for the good supper he gave us.” “Have you here my father's large Bible?” asked the son of the widow. She brought it forth from its sacred depositary, carefully wrapped in a towel. Tears of rapturous gratitude chased each other along the furrows, which bitter and burning ones had made so deep, as she heard him, with slow and solemn utterance, read that self-abasing melody of the Psalmist: “Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness; according to the multitude of thy mercies, blot out my transgressions.” This was the Psalm, that during his brokenness of spirit, on the deep waters, had been his comforter; and now he seemed to breathe into its eloquent words, the soul of penitence and devotion. At its close, he kneeled and poured out a fervent prayer to the God of their salvation; and the sleep which fell that night upon all the habitants of that lowly abode, was sweet as an angel's smile. The daily efforts of Richard Jones, for the comfort of his mother, were beautiful. Her unspoken wishes were studied with a zeal, which feels it can never either fully repay, or atone. For her sake, and for that of the little orphans intrusted to their care, he rejoiced at the gains, which, through the friendship of the supercargo, he had been enabled to acquire in a foreign clime, and which to their moderated desires were comparative wealth. But amid the prosperity which had been granted him, he still turned with humility to the memorials of his wasted years. In his conversations with his mother, he frankly narrated his sins; and while he went down into the dark depths whither intemperance had led him, she shuddered, and was silent. Yet, when he spoke of the benefactor who had found him in the streets, ready to become a self-murderer, she raised her clasped hands, and with strong emotion besought blessings on him who had “saved a soul from death.” They felt that it is not the highest and holiest compassion to relieve the body's ills; but to rescue and bind up the poor heart that hath wounded itself, and which the world hath cast out, to be trodden down in its unpurged guilt. He was not long in discovering how the heart of his mother yearned after that former home, from which poverty had driven her. On inquiry, he found that it might be obtained, having been recently tenanted by vagrant people. The time that he devoted to its thorough repair was happily spent. Its broken casements were replaced, and its dingy walls whitened. The fences were restored, with the pretty gate, over whose arch he promised himself, that another season should bring the blossoming vine that his lost sister had loved. He sought also, in various places, those articles of furniture which had been disposed of through necessity, and which he had valued in earlier days. Soon the old clock, with a new case, merrily ticked in the corner, and the cushioned arm-chair again stood by the hearth-stone. Near it was poor Margaret's work-table, with a freshly-polished surface, on which he laid, when about to take possession, the large family Bible bearing his father's name. Bright and happy was that morning, when leaning on his arm, the children walking hand in hand beside them, neatly apparelled, the widowed mother approached the home endeared by tender recollections, and whence, poor and desolate, she had gone forth. As she paused a moment at the door, the overflowing, unutterable emotion, was gratitude for the restored virtue of the being most 4 beloved on earth. It would seem that congenial thoughts occupied him, for drawing her arm more tenderly within his own, he said: “Lo! this thy son was dead, and is alive again, and was lost, and is found.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE ANTIDOTE. Man press'd a cluster in his cup, The grape, with ruby glow,— How high its sparkling foam leaped up! But ruin lurked below. A direr draught a demon gave, With fiercer venom fired,— The tempted drank the burning wave, Till reason's light expired The weeping skies a crystal shed, As pity's tears distil; It mantled at the fountain's head And in the gushing rill: It bore a spell to heal his wound, His fever-thirst to calm,— And lured him with a silver sound To taste its trickling balm. In trembling penitence he bowed, He laved the leprous stain,— And those pure tear-drops from the cloud Restored his health again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE WATER-BEARER. I saw a child, who towards his cottage-home Two water-buckets bare. The winding path Was steep and rocky, and his slender arm Taxed to its utmost power. Awhile he paused, Setting his burden down, just where the way Grew more precipitous, and wiped his brow With his worn sleeve, and breathed refreshing draughts Of the sweet air, while still the summer sun Flamed o'er his forehead. Then, another boy, Who, 'neath a poplar, in a neighboring field, Sate playing with his dog in cool repose, Uprising from that grassy nook, came forth, And lent a ready hand to aid the toil. So on they went together, grasping firm The heavy buckets with a right good will, While their young voices blended, clear and glad. And as the bee inhales from humblest flower Sown by the wayside, honey for her hive,— I treasured up a lesson; and when eve Called home the laboring ox, and to its nest Warned the sweet bird, and closed the lily's cup, I took my little son upon my knee, And told him of the water-bearer's toil, And of the friendly helper. When his eye Grew large, and bright, and strongly fixed on mine, Taking the story to his inmost thought, I said,—“Drink thou the water from the spring, That God hath made, and not the fiery cup Of evil men, that burns the shrinking soul. My gentle child, be pitiful to all, For in thy heart are seeds of sympathy, Whose buds are virtues and their fruit for heaven. And when thou art a man, my blessed one, Keep thy fresh spirit open to the woes Of foreigner and stranger, of the race Darken'd by Afric's sun, or those sad tribes The red-brow'd people of the wilderness, Lone exiles from those streams and forest-glades That erst they call'd their own. With ready hand Help whosoe'er thou canst. So, mayst thou find Succor and love, in thine own hour of need, If on thy heart, as on a signet-ring, Is grav'd that precept from a Rock divine, `Bear one another's burdens, and fulfil The law of Christ.”'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRINKING SONG. Drink, friends, the parting hour draws nigh, Drink, and forget your care; The sultry summer noon is high, Drink, and your strength repair. Spare not, there's plenty, take your fill, We have a vineyard proud,— A reservoir on vale and hill, A fountain in the cloud. Our flowing bowl is large, you see, Lift high the song of cheer; Our hearts are warm, our hands are free, Drink deep, and never fear. Our father Sun, the example gives, Our mother Earth, also,— He drinketh sly, above the sky, She jocuned drinks below. Pledge, friends, pledge deep before we part, To absent wife, or daughter, Or bright-eyed maid, who rules your heart,— Drink deep, but only water.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PATRIARCH. “This earth doth yield More than enough,—that temperance may be tried.” Milton. In the days of old, there dwelt a Patriarch toward the rising sun, among the mountains of Asia. Many, and sore troubles had he seen, and stood faithful, when all around him fell, and were punished. He was a tiller of the earth, and when it had brought forth its fruits, he with his wife and children fed thereon, and blessed the Lord. And it came to pass, after he had cast in his seeds, and the rain had watered them, and they put forth abundantly, each after his kind, that there came up a plant exceeding fair, and of a very tender green. And as he visited it in the morning, when the dews had hung a pearl upon the point of every young leaf, lo! it lifted up tendrils, like the hands of a little child, that reacheth and gropeth after some pleasant thing. Then he set a prop near it, and guided thereunto the wandering shoots, for he said, “Peradventure its heart is weak, and it needeth that some one should train it in the right way.” So it grew and became a vine, and stretched out interlacing boughs, making a goodly shadow. And as he diligently regarded it, there appeared clusters of fair grapes, hiding among the branches. Then the master of the vine smelled a sweet savor, and called together his household, and they marvelled at its beauty. Deeper and deeper these clusters blushed, as the sun looked upon them, and when they were fully ripe, rich moisture trickled from their bursting pores, and fell upon the ground. When the Patriarch pressed some of them, the sweet blood flowed freely, and fermented, and he drank thereof. But, behold! his wisdom departed from him, and he lay uncovered within his tent. Then were his children affrighted, and spake one to another, not knowing what these things should mean. And the youngest son mocked, and derided, saying, “Lo! he who reproveth our folly, hath himself become altogether vain. Doth it not behoove him who warneth others, that he take heed unto his own ways?” Then his elder brethren answered, “Hold thy peace! He that revileth his father, God shall judge.” So they took a garment, and reverently covered the Patriarch, walking backwards, that they might not look upon his frailty. And they sate down mournfully near the door of the tent, and the two elder brethren communed together, saying,— “How great was our father! and how was he honored of God, inasmuch as he hid not from him, the flood that was to drown the whole earth.” “When all flesh had corrupted itself, he alone was found pleasing to his Maker, and with eloquent words did he patiently warn a world that was filled with violence.” “Yea! and through his faith were we saved, when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, for he alone found grace to guide the lonely ark over the billows, where slept the world of the ungodly.” “To him alone did the dove bring the first green token from the abating waters; when all who had escaped the deluge, came forth, as from a prison, upon this Ararat.” “But now, because he hath drank of the fruit of the vine, behold! he lieth sick and powerless, as the babe that is newly born. Who knoweth whether he is not now to die?” And they lifted up their voices and wept. Then were their hearts comforted: as though some good angel breathed upon them, “Lo! the Patriarch shall not die. The glory of his reason shall return unto him, and he will repent himself, and as the bow enlighteneth the cloud, so shall his righteousness be renewed.” And it came to pass, that when he awoke from his trance, he called for his elder sons, and blessed them. 4* But he uttered a malediction on him, who had mocked at his father in the hour of his adversity and shame. Thus knew the Patriarch the evil that dwelt in the vine, which his own hands had reared. He learned, in bitterness and scorn, what was taught us from the beginning, of the curse that lay hidden in the cluster which doth seem so fair. Moreover, a Holy Book that his eyes had never looked upon, doth instruct us, saying, “Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright; for at the last, it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE VINE. The vine hath beauty rare, We train its tender shoot, We twine it round the trellis fair, And praise its fragrant fruit,— Yet there's a secret vein Of poison near its bower, And he will find it to his pain Who tampers with its power. So, from life's earliest morn, While we like shadows pass, Beneath the rose-cup lurks the thorn, The adder in the grass,— Be ours the lore of Heaven, Clear mind and cloudless view, To share the Eden it hath given, And shun the serpent too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOSES IN MIDIAN. Why art thou here, amid the streams and flocks, Oh, foster-son of Egypt! rear'd in all The luxury of courts? Is there no nerve Of strong ambition in thy secret soul? Didst never think, 'twere sweet to be a king? Or that her love who drew thee from the Nile, Fill'd with compassion for the babe that wept, Might to her other bounties add a crown? But yet thou seem'st content with rural charms, Nor wears thy brow a trace of wrinkling care Or rootless expectation. Thy young heart's Requited love, and the free intercourse With Nature in her solitude and peace, Her fringed fountains and heaven-haunted dells, Give thee full solace. And when twilight gray Leadeth thy lambs to fold, or trembling stars Look from their chambers on the sleeping founts With tender eye, perchance thy hand doth strike The solitary lyre, or weave in dyes Of sable and of gold, his wondrous fate Who drank so deep of sorrow and of joy,—. The man of Uz. For Poesy doth dwell With pastoral musing, and the tuneful lore Of birds and brooks. And who feeleth that æolian harp within him, hath no need Of the inspiring wine-cup, or the gong Of the great, pompous world. Spake not the voice Of Midian's gushing waters to thine ear, Prelusive of the honors and the toils Awaiting thee? Came there no darkened dream Of desert wanderings? of a manna-fed And murmuring host? of thine own burdened heart Bearing alone, the cumbrance and the strife Of mutinous spirits, when the wrath of God Burned fierce among them, and avenging Earth Opening her mouth, prepared their living tomb? Oh! linger still, amid the groves and streams, And to green pastures, fed by gladsome rills, Lead on with gentle crook thy docile sheep, While yet thou may'st. With holy Nature make Close fellowship, and woo the still, small voice Of inspiration, to thy secret soul, In lonely thought. So shall it gather strength To do the bidding of Omnipotence, And walk on Sinai, face to face, with God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TWO DRAUGHTS. There's a draught that causeth sadness, Though of mirth it seems the friend; To the brain it mounts in madness, And in misery hath its end. To the household hearth it creepeth, And the fire in winter dies; There a lonely woman weepeth, While the famished infant cries. Bloated form and brow it bringeth, Limbs that totter to and fro, And at last, like scorpion, stingeth To an agony of woe. Round the victim's feet it weaveth Snares, that blind his eyes in gloom; Sin it sows, and shame receiveth, Frowns of hate, and deeds of doom. Bitter words of strife it teacheth, Striketh kind affections dead; Even beyond the grave it reacheth, To the judgment bar of dread. Hath not life enough of sorrow, Sickness, mourning, and decay, That we needs must madly borrow Thorns to strew its shortening way? There's a draught that heaven distilleth, Pure as crystal, from the skies; Freely, whosoever willeth, May partake it, and be wise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LOUISA WILSON. “Was I not, that hour, The lady of his heart?—princess of life?— Mistress of feast and favor?—Could I touch A rose with my white hand, but it became Fairer at once? And is it not my shame To have caus'd such woe myself, from all that joy?” Miss Barrett. “What! still a prisoner to this odious influenza?” said a bright belle, as she gayly glided into the chamber of her friend. “Not exactly ill, Julia; but then such a hideous swollen face, as you see, makes it quite impossible to appear. I think my nose has grown large, too; don't you? And this chill, cheerless November weather, makes it no great trial to keep house.” “Oh! but you might have put on a thick, green veil, and wrapped yourself up in furs, just to have gone to church, and seen the wedding of Frederick Wilson and Louisa.” “Is it possible! It is only a few days since I heard of the return of Frederick Wilson, from Europe. What a march they have stolen!” “Not much of a stolen march, dear Emma. They have been engaged full three years. Indeed, so long did he stay on his travels, that many thought the marriage would never take place at all.” “Come now, lay aside your muff, and mantilla, and be the good Samaritan, and tell me all about it. Yes, please! What was the possible need of their being in such a remarkable hurry?” “I believe it was understood that the event would take place immediately after his arrival; and they wished to be established in their city-home before the winter.” “Well, they might at least have given information of the hour of their nuptials, to some of their old acquaintance. Though, I presume, a little mystery gives a wonderful zest to matrimony.” “Their plan was to leave for their journey, in the morning cars; and by appointing the ceremony at an early hour, they hoped to avoid a dense crowd, and so kill two birds with one stone.” “Expert archers, without a doubt.—Did Louisa look well?” “Beautifully, as you know brides always do. She wore a fair muslin, fine as a thought, and white as the driven snow. It was fitted perfectly to her graceful form, and her neck, and delicately rounded arms, were like alabaster. Her flowing, bridal veil, was confined above her sunny curls with pure jasmine and the orange-flower. She wore no other ornament.” “Why, who would have expected such remarkable plainness from her? Has she turned Quaker?” “No. It was the taste of the bridegroom, who is, I suppose, a trifle more infallible than ever, from having visited so many of the European courts.” “I should think he would have become so accustomed to splendor and elegance abroad, as to require it the more at home.” “They say it has rather led him to admire simplicity. At any rate, Louisa never looked so well in her life with those downcast eyes, their long fringes resting on her glowing cheek, and that sweet air of dependence on him, which is so winning. I understand he has brought her the most magnificent things; sets of pearl, and diamonds, and so forth, which will be worn at the parties, in the high circles where they are to move.” “I wonder if the old aunt who brought her up, will be urged to make her appearance there?” “She has been invited to take her residence with them, but declines. Her age makes a quiet home more agreeable.” “Perhaps Louisa might be ashamed of aunty's country manners, among her new, fashionable friends.” “Oh, Emma, I can never think her so heartless.” “Nor I. But go on with your description of the wedding, my dear creature. And pray, disencumber yourself of those immense indian-rubbers, and take the other velvet rocking-chair. There, now we shall be so cozy.” “Fred Wilson, you know, was always a jewel of a man, so high-bred, so refined. He is still more polished by foreign travel, which his wealth gave him every advantage of making both improving, and extensive. I never thought him so handsome as this morning; his intellectual features were lighted up with such a beaming happiness, like one who has gained a priceless treasure. Then, he responded so touchingly, `till death us do part!' It was both solemn and beautiful. I caught a glimpse of the group at the church-door, while he was throwing her cashmere round her, with perfect tenderness, as if he feared the slightest visiting of the rude air for his precious one. Every creature pressed forward, to get a view of her, as she stepped into her coach, and there was such a rush that I was glad to escape.” “I never thought, for my part, Louisa more beautiful than several others of our acquaintance, whom I could name.” “Perhaps not. But then she is exceedingly graceful, and shows, in all she says and does, her accomplished education. Then, you know, there is something so fascinating about a bride, leaving as she does all the sacred spots of early recollection,—the play-places, and playmates of her childhood, the hearth-stone, where she was trained and sheltered as a tender blossom,—to make to herself a new home, to trust in new friends, to endure new trials, supported only by his love who was once to her as a stranger, but is now to be more than all the world besides: there is in this something sublime, yet sad, even to tears.” “Bless me, Julia, you are right eloquent. Did our good clergyman preach a sermon on the occasion, and you take notes, for the benefit and behoof of all spinsters? Was there a crowd at this pathetic ceremony?” “Yes, notwithstanding it was at the early hour of eight. Directly in front of me, were the three tall Misses Astor, through whose interstices I was obliged to gather, by skilful dodging, almost all that I saw; for, you know, to look over their shoulders would be impossible to any but a son of Anak. They had made their toilet in a hurry, and could not wholly conceal, under their smart, new hats, their hair en papillote. Here and there was a heavy sprinkling of ancient maidens, who, I think, had left breakfast uneaten, and were wanting it. Even the fat, red-faced tavern-keeper waddled there, and the lame lady over the way; and scores of boys hung upon the columns and tops of pews like monkeys, though the sexton did all in his power to keep them down. Everybody looked good-natured and animated. Indeed, it was a scene altogether worth going out for, this raw morning. I am sorry you should have made choice of such a time to wear a kerchief.” “You are so kind, Julia, to come and amuse me with your nice descriptions, that I believe I have lost nothing. Indeed, I may have a clearer idea of the whole than if I had been there myself; for your perceptive powers are vastly better developed than mine. I declare, I feel quite recovered from my inapposite illness, by your entertaining talk.” Thus renovated and cheered, the two friends started upon a little tongue-race, alternately spurring and outstripping each other, with exuberant fluency, and girlish spirits. Louisa passed the usual anatomical process, which the respective positions of engagement and matrimony involve. Minute points were scanned, not from censoriousness, but from the habit of analysis common to the tact, and rapid movement of the female mind. The catalogue of faults was, however, on the present citation quite moderate; the most prominent one seeming to be a sort of variation of mood and manner, not exactly amounting to caprice, but verging at times towards the extremes of sprightliness, and taciturnity. Finally, with the good feeling common to their happy season of life, they summed up the whole, with a preponderance of agreeable properties, and a reiteration of their full sense of her good fortune, in gaining a companion and an establishment so eligible; and an admission, that in person and education she was qualified to be an ornament to both. This bridal gave similar materials for delineation and discussion in other circles, throughout the township, and an acceptable subject for sundry letters, between fair and young correspondents; after which it gave place to other bubbles on the wave of life, and fell into the shadow of things that were. In the meantime, Frederick Wilson, and his young wife, had become somewhat domesticated in their new home. It comprised every element of comfort, with the embellishments of taste. Its owner found a new impulse in rendering it worthy of the chosen of his heart, and was but too happy to hear her praise the mansion and grounds of which he had made her the mistress, and the works of art, with which the spacious apartments were decorated. Nor was she an ungrateful recipient of his tenderness and liberality; but repaid them with the fulness of a susceptible heart, glorying in its first love. He viewed her as the “purest pearl from ocean's deepest cell,” and she turned to him as the flower to the sun, confiding, and constant. Congeniality of taste heightened the pleasure of their intercourse;—the same book, the same picture, the same music delighted them, and the claims of society were met, and discharged, with a kindred satisfaction. He was charmed at the admiration which her courteous manners and brilliant conversation elicited, and she took pride in a husband, who, to every manly accomplishment, added the good sense of prizing more highly his own native land, after that comparison with others, which is sometimes so perilous to patriotism. Matrimonial life opened for them with an Eden splendor, and it was long ere any shadow darkened amid its bowers. The first drawback to their felicity, was a species of nonchalance or indifference, not on the part of the husband, but the wife. Expecting a warm participation in whatever interested him, this change vexed his sensibility. He recalled every minutiæ of his own deportment, fearing there might have been involuntary remissness, and redoubled his assiduity to discover and gratify her wishes. But these periods of abstractedness or stupor, which originally occurred at long intervals, grew more frequent, sometimes alternating with a mirth apparently as causeless, and equally ungrateful. He became apprehensive that her nervous system was unhinged, and anxiously summoned medical skill to her aid. These apparent caprices did not impair warmth of heart, or vivacity of intellect, but were in painful contrast, as the cloud with the sunbeam. To the earnest inquiries of her husband, she was accustomed to speak lightly, as of constitutional headaches, severe, but temporary. Exceedingly did he dread their recurrence,—especially, when the glance of any other observer was added to his own; for such was the sensitive nature of his love, that he shrank at the thought that the slightest reproach should fall upon its object, and hoarded her praises as the miser his gold. Thus passed away the first year, and a portion of the second of their matrimonial life. Louisa was amiable to all around, benevolent to the poor, and devoted to the happiness of her husband, with the exception of the variations of manner which have been mentioned. These, he could not but apprehend, had a different, and deeper source than the physical indispositions under which they were sheltered. His penetration was not so far hoodwinked as to mistake the fact, that they were in some measure dependent on volition. His continued fear was, that the same misgiving might spring up in the mind of others; and he spread out, as it were, his whole being to guard her from suspicion, until the effort was agony. At length, with the frankness which was a part of his nature, and the tenderness due to a wife, he warned her of the fault to which he believed her to be addicted, and set forth its inevitable consequences, with feeling, and emphasis. Her reply was a reiterated assurance, that she had used only a stimulating medicine, prescribed by a physician, for the nervous headaches to which, from early childhood, she had been subject; and passed into such emotions of resentment, and passionate grief, that he almost shuddered at the step he had taken, and fervently hoped that his suspicions might have been groundless. In retirement, Louisa's conscience keenly smote her. She wept, and lay upon the earth. She detested herself for her duplicity, and determined no longer to wreck the peace of the husband whom she loved. She resolved to forsake a habit on which she could not reflect without abhorrence, and mourned that she had not possessed sufficient moral courage to acknowledge it, and implore his aid in its extirpation. The eagle eye of the husband detected the change that ensued with unspeakable gratitude. Louisa was now all that he could desire. Her fine mind and large heart, seemed enfranchised from a hateful bondage. Whatever could be devised for her happiness, was sedulously obtained, and her unspoken wishes studied. He said, mentally, “How can I ever efface from her affectionate heart the suffering I have inflicted, or reward her for the struggle she has so successfully endured?” and he literally overwhelmed her with the fulness of his love. She too exulted in that love, and in being worthy of it. She felt that she had achieved a victory; and secretly despised those who, being in like manner enslaved, did not resolutely break their chains.—But let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed! Pleasant would it be to linger on this period of conjugal felicity. But the evil habit, of which we have spoken, is like the “strong man armed,” and though Love may wrestle with it, till the break of day, it will scarcely prevail, unless it take hold of the strength of Omnipotence. Frederick and Louisa both enjoyed refined society, and were qualified to adorn it. From the earliest date of their marriage they had discharged its claims, with a disposition both to receive and impart happiness. In those fashionable parties which require elaborate dress and preparation, their position obliged them sometimes to mingle, and their reception was always flattering. But 5 their principal social delight, was to surround their table with a few chosen friends, where the flow of soul was not impeded by the ice of ceremony. These pleasant gatherings had been gradually laid aside, during the domination of Louisa's tyrant foe. For though she had always maintained sufficient caution to appear well on public, and formal occasions, it was sometimes the reverse in those visits which involved less restraint. She more slightly armed herself, where the inspection was more concentrated and critical. Sometimes, Frederick had been compelled to meet their invited guests, with the excuse of her having an excruciating headache; and though he loathed to lend his aid to what he deemed deception, and felt like a divided being, while discharging alone the requisitions of hospitality, still he considered it a duty to protect the reputation of his wife, and was thankful when she did not, by her presence, overthrow it. Now, that this reign of terror was over, he indulged with a buoyant heart in his favorite social entertainments; while his fair, kindred spirit, presided with her characteristic elegance and grace. One fine morning in summer, he came in, remarking that he had met acquaintances from a distant city, to whom he wished to show attention; and if she had no other engagement, would invite them to a quiet cup of tea, with a few of their neighbors and more intimate friends. She concurred with an affectionate zeal in his plans, and arranged on the mantel-pieces, with exquisite taste, a variety of vases, filled with rich flowers from their garden and conservatory. She busied herself to see that everything was in order, and proposed, what she knew would please him, to pour out the tea with her own hand, at a table in the parlor where they should assemble. He was partial to this mode, from the principle of dispensing with ceremony, wherever it was possible, and also from early recollection, having been accustomed thus to see his mother entertain her friends; and knew that on Louisa's part this was a submission to his preference, which he did not fail to appreciate. Their guests arrived at an early hour, and were admiring the paintings and statuary that decorated the lofty apartments, and inhaling the balmy air through the long windows, opening upon a colonnade, whose pillars were clasped by clustering vines, and adorned with blossoming shrubbery. Frederick hastened to summon Louisa, and was startled to find her not only in dishabille, but,— with the headache. He begged that he might excuse her, and advised, by all means, that she should remain in her room. But she was bent on descending, and by a strong effort, in which she excelled, managed to welcome her visitants, with tolerable grace. Yet those who were well acquainted with her, could not fail to detect in her sleepy eyes, and causeless repetitions in discourse, that she was not herself. The tea-equipage was brought in. And now, the simple mode of presenting it, which he had accepted as a favor, was a new source of apprehension. Seating herself at the table, behind her splendid service of silver, she filled the cup nearest to her, and continued pouring, pouring, pouring, until the overflowing tray discharged its superfluous beverage upon the rich carpets. The agonized husband affected not to observe it, and talked with his friends rapidly, and at random. An elderly lady, a distant relative of his mother, quietly approaching, begged to relieve her of the office, on account of her indisposition. “No, no, I thank you. I am fond of pouring out. I am quite used to it, I assure you.” Frederick, springing to her side, exclaimed,— “I hope you will allow Mrs. Carlton to take your place.” “I have myself,” said that lady, in a low, soothing tone, “been so troubled with severe nervous headaches in my youth, as to be nearly blind; and quite too tremulous for any effort like this.” “But I have no headache now,—no,—just none at all. I insist on helping my friends to refreshments, myself. It is such a great,—a very great,—great,—pleasure, indeed.” Frederick led her unwillingly to a sofa, where she half reclined against one of its pillows. The servant, having his tray restored to order, through the care of Mrs. Carlton, commenced to serve the company, and was about passing her, when she siezed his arm with a sudden sweep, calling out,— “Here, bring me a cup. Why do you pass me by? I'll have you to know, that I'm your mistress.” Then she fell into an immoderate fit of laughter, while her husband, pale, and in torture, half persuading, and half compelling, took her to her own room. At his return he attempted no apology, and the guests, after a few ineffectual efforts to converse and be at ease, excused themselves, and departed. Mrs. Carlton lingered awhile, after all others had gone, and motioning towards a boudoir, said in a low, gentle voice,— “My dear Mr. Wilson, your mother's blood is in my veins. I love you, and I love your wife. Can I be of use to either of you?” “Oh, no! at least I do not see how. These terrible headaches are destroying her nervous system. She has had them from early youth. I have applied to the best physicians, but they give no relief.” “Have you applied to the Great Physician?—Frederick Wilson, I admire your conjugal tenderness and constancy. But their utmost ingenuity cannot blind others to a fault so palpable. I have long been aware of it. Absolve your noble mind from the penance of this vain disguise, which the eye of even the commonest servant can penetrate.” “Why do you seek to draw such a confession from me?” “That I may soothe the anguish that is eating away your existence, and, if possible, help you both.” Pacing the room, with rapid and disordered steps, he at length paused opposite to her, repeating half unconsciously,— “Help us! help us! How can that be?” She took his hand in hers, and drawing him to a seat by her side, said with maternal kindness,— “Can you feel willing to confide in me so far as to say whether you have ever spoken to Louisa of her destructive habit?” “I have.” “Freely, and firmly, as a husband should?” “Freely, and firmly—oh, yes. And she seemed to have reformed. It is now a long,—long time since aught of this kind has occurred. I thought she was my own blessed angel again. Oh, my God!” He covered his face with his hands, but through his convulsed fingers the oozing tears found their way. The sympathizing friend waited till the emotion had subsided, and he exclaimed,— “If you can do anything for us, do it, in Heaven's name!” “My dear Frederick, my heart bleeds for you. I am old, and have seen something of the world. I know how hard it is for a victim to escape these toils of the tempter. The warmest affections, the highest talents, the most indomitable pride, have been set in array against them, and fallen. Believe me, you are not the person to manage this matter. Will you leave it to me?” “You have my everlasting gratitude for this heavenly benevolence. I put myself under your control.” “Then I shall require you to obey implicitly. I know you wish to visit your estates in a distant county. Leave the house early in the morning, without seeing Louisa. I will remain with her, and watch over her during your absence. My lone widowhood will enable me so to arrange my family, that none will sustain injury. I feel this effort to save her to be all-important.” “But how will you explain the circumstance of my departure?” “I will inform her that you have left on business, grieved to the heart, by her perseverance in error. If necessary, I will even suggest that your return may depend on her conduct.” “My dear Mrs. Carlton, you are too severe. You will drive her to desperation.” “Have you not seen the futility of temporizing measures?—of appeals to all the native emotions, and forms of tenderness? I repeat to you, that I love Louisa, both for your sake and her own. My feelings have been strongly drawn out to her, from some personal resemblance she bears to the last darling daughter, whom Heaven took from my embrace to its own. I promise you to be kind, and to apprise you constantly by letter of our progress. Do you trust to me?” “I do.” “Entirely?” “Without reserve. May God forever bless you.” “And now, my son, try to snatch a brief rest. May He, who alone can give success to our endeavors, be with us both.” The bright morning rose upon the departing husband, and the faithful friend by the bedside of the inebriate. Reason returned slowly, and then she was advised by Mrs. Carlton to remain quiet, as if a sufferer from acute disease. She took care that proper nourishment was administered, and towards evening drawing the curtain, said,— “How are you now, dear Louisa? You know you have been quite ill, and I am here to see to your comfort.” “Ill! You here!—Where is Frederick?” “He left home this morning.” “Left! My husband gone!—Where?” “On business, among his distant estates, which you know he has long wished to transact.” “Very singular, indeed. When is he to return?” “There is some uncertainty about it. Perhaps the time may depend somewhat upon you.” “What can you mean?” leaping from the bed. “What sort of language is this to me? I am sure you were never deputed by him to treat me in this remarkable manner.” “Dear Louisa, you have many accomplishments, and virtues. I admire them, and love you. But I am constrained to say, that you are under the dominion of a fearful habit, that wrecks your husband's peace, and your own reputation. Strive to arouse yourself.” “Arouse myself? Indeed!—that I will do. And in the first place, leave me directly; or I will inform my husband of your intrusion, and strange behavior.” “I am here by his permission. What I say to you, has his sanction.” “Either you are false, or I am most wretched.” Pitying her distress, Mrs. Carlton would fain have drawn her to her bosom. “Let me be your comforter, my poor child. You have never known a mother's care from your infancy. I will be your mother. I will aid in restoring you to the respect of those who love you, and to your own. Confide in me.” But she repulsed her, exclaiming that her husband had deserted her, and she would have no other false friend, but desired to die. Days passed, in which Mrs. Carlton was resolutely shut from her presence, seeing no shadow of success to her experiment, and had she not been the possessor of singular perseverance, would have despaired. She remained in the house of the unhappy woman, regulating the servants, and laboring invisibly for her welfare. 5* Notwithstanding her vigilance, in forbidding the access to her apartment of anything that could intoxicate, it was evident that she was in possession of some secret hoard by which she was kept in a state of partial stupefaction. Finding all appeals to her understanding and affections alike fruitless, while reason was thus dethroned, and knowing her mind to be much under the influence of imagination, she conceived a design of calling that powerful element to her aid. The dusk of a summer twilight deepened, as Louisa reclined upon her couch, apparently emerging from a long, dream-like reverie. She alternately dozed and mused, until the darkness of night gathered. Partially raising herself to ring for lights, her eye was arrested by a circular spot of ineffable brightness on the pannel of the wall opposite her bed. It burst forth exactly between the portraits of her father and mother,—trembled, expanded, and became stationary. In its centre appeared a form, tall, commanding, and wrapped in a long, dark mantle. Its features were stern, and the glance of its piercing eyes seemed the reproof of a spirit. Then a long bony finger was raised, and moved with a warning gesture; while from lips that seemed immovable came forth slow, solemn intonations, every one sinking like molten lead into her soul:— “Beware!—Beware! The cup looks fair, But its dregs are woe, and care: Ruin,—ruin,—and despair.” Shuddering she closed her eyes, pressing her hands tightly over them. When she ventured to withdraw the screen, the vision had departed. She rested upon her pillow and trembled. A strain of dulcet music, strange and wild, floated along. A gush of perfume filled the room. Again, that circle of almost ineffable brightness. It overspread the curtain that shaded the full-length portrait of her mother. From its centre glided a female form, clad in flowing robes, with a countenance of radiant and solemn beauty. For a moment it seemed inclined to hover with a tremulous motion; then stood still; and, as if the dead canvas had awoke to life and sound, uttered slowly, analyzing every syllable,— “Daughter!—Repent! and do the first works, or else”— Ere those deep, impressive, unearthly tones had ceased, she sprang from the couch,—but all was darkness. She stretched out her arms, as the fair being faded,— “Oh, mother! Mother, stay! Hear me promise. I do repent. I will try to do the first works. Blessed mother, return to your unworthy child.” Her cry of terror brought Mrs. Carlton to her side, whose neck she eagerly clasped, hiding her face, with sobs, in her bosom. “Oh, dear, dear friend! I have been warned by unearthly beings. A fair,—and a fearful form. One was like the picture of that mother who died before my remembrance. She spoke to me holy words. The other was so stern! His voice still sounds in my ears— `Woe and care, woe and care, Ruin,—ruin,—and despair!' In these how madly have I plunged. Who will save me? Oh! that I had some one to love me.” The pitying friend soothed her, promising to be a mother and a guide. She now passed from the extreme of aversion to that of childlike, enthusiastic attachment. Unreserved confidence followed—free confessions, and emphatic resolutions of amendment. “Alas, dear friend! this fearful habit dates from early years, when wine was associated with hospitality as an element of happiness. My loneliness as an orphan, without brother or sister, and the secluded habits of the aunt with whom I resided, made me exceedingly delight in those few social and festive seasons that varied the monotony of our life. In these entertainments wine was always prominent. I heard no odium attached to it, and tasted and admired. Thus, even in childhood, was laid the foundation of my shame. “The long three years' absence of the lover whom I adored were darkened with fears lest he might never return, or at least, with an unchanged heart. In these periods of depression wine was my comforter. I even ventured to tamper with the fire of ardent spirits. Then I first learned its power of excitement and the reaction that follows. Whether any penetrated my secret, I know not; but the variation of manner thus caused, my young companions designated as caprice and a fitful temperament. “With this sin on my soul, I dared to enter the holy bands of wedlock; not without a solemn vow to forsake it, and innumerable struggles to keep that vow. How false that vow,—how vain those struggles,—he best knows whom most I love. But the shame, the deception, the misery, the self-loathing, are scanned only by the Eye that readeth the spirit.” Days were spent in salutary conversations, during which the venerable lady strove to impress the absolute need of humility before God, and of trusting in Him for that guidance and support, without which “nothing is strong, nothing is holy.” She commiserated but did not repress those searchings of heart, without whose discipline she felt that reformation might be rootless. Earnestly did she labor to impress that fear of the Almighty, which is the beginning of wisdom. “She spoke of sinners' lost estate, In Christ renew'd, regenerate, Of God's most blest decree, That not a single soul should die, Which turn'd repentant with the cry,— Be merciful to me.' This indefatigable friend held daily communications with the absent and anxious husband, respecting every stage of their progress, and at length wrote, with a hand tremulous from joy,— “Dear Frederick,— Louisa is worthy of you.—Return. E. Carlton.” The wings of the wind seemed to have brought the summoned one. The meeting is not a subject of description. It can be imagined only by those who know the full force of the words,—repentant! forgiven! and beloved! Mrs. Carlton returned to her abode, full of gratitude for the privilege of this labor of friendship, and for its blessed results. Ardent attachment, and the most filial attentions from those whom she had thus been permitted to serve were a part of her recompense, and brightened her declining years. Scarcely a day was allowed to pass without visit or message to the loved neighbor and benefactress. One evening, while a chill storm was raging violently, Mr. Wilson entered. “My dear friend, I had not expected any one to dare this dark conflict of the elements for my sake.” “Did you suppose we could allow your birthday to pass without recognition? I assure you, I had hard work to keep Louisa from accompanying me, notwithstanding the tempest.” Opening a basket, he produced a cap and collar, elegantly wrought by her hand, and a magnificent boquet, where camellias of the richest hues, and the mystic passion-flower with its waving tendrils, and the heliotrope and tuberose breathing over the dahlias a cloud of perfume, and the crimson spire of the sage, and the white bosom of the artemisia, were strongly contrasted with the background of evergreen on which they reposed. “Ah! such beautiful tributes of art and nature should be for the fair and the flourishing, rather than for those in the winter of their days. I cannot but wonder how dear Louisa should thus have kept in mind the date of my birth.” “There is a tablet in both our hearts, running thus:— `Let not the day be writ, Love will remember it, Untold, unsaid.”' “How much am I indebted to you both, for the unremitting kindness that cheers the evening of my days.” “Oh, dear Mrs. Carlton, you have no imagination of the treasure I now possess in her. She is so gentle, so radiant with intellectual life,—so earnest to efface the memory of the past, so full of all good works, that I can never adequately speak her praise, or my happiness.” “Heaven be praised! She is indeed a lovely, talented being, and most dear to us both. May her feet ever stand firm upon the unfailing Rock.” “Did you ever perfectly explain to me, the cause of that sudden transition from aversion to delight in your society, which occurred during my painful absence?” “Perhaps I may need your pardon for the course pursued in this particular, though certainly not for the motive that prompted it. Her antipathy to me was so great, and the stupor in which she lay so continued, that I was ready to despair of gaining an opportunity to serve her. I cast about for the best means that remained to me, and not without misgiving, made a selection. None can be much with her, and not perceive that imagination is a prominent feature in her mind; and as the reasoning powers were almost constantly dormant, I seemed driven to make an appeal to that. A little device with the magic lantern, which, had her intellect been unclouded, she would have detected in a moment, wrought effects surpassing my anticipation. It gave access to her presence, from which I had before been excluded, and pitying Heaven did the rest.” “How far do you suppose she is aware of the measure to which you resorted?” “I doubt whether she has more than a dreamy remembrance of the scene. Sometimes, I have thought I would confess the whole to her and implore her forgiveness. But she has never made any allusion to it, and I have thought it better to fortify her virtue, than to stir up the dregs of indistinct and harrowing recollection. Possibly, my conscience has not always been perfectly satisfied to have thus invoked stratagem; but the case was a peculiar one, requiring peculiar measures. Forgive me, if I have erred through excess of zeal to arrest the wanderer and save the lost.” “We can never thank you as we ought, for all you have done for us.” “If I have been the means of any good, thank not me, but Him from whom all good proceedeth. But the whole of this life is a warfare, my dear young friend, and it is never safe to lay aside that fear which drives us to trust in Omnipotence.” “All your counsel is to us most precious.” “You are both to me as children; you seem to stand in the places of those whom our Father has taken from my house and heart, to whom I hasten. Your beautiful wife is truly attractive, highly endowed, and full of love to you; but in this our state of discipline and danger, possibly she is not armed with that strong heart which foils temptation by perfect trust in an arm Divine. Teach her to expect difficult duty, and let it be your care to gird her up for it by deepening her piety.” “I feel the force of all you say, our blessed mother,— so we speak of you to each other. Indulge us in that sweet appellation.” Pressing his hand between both of hers, she added, solemnly and affectionately,— “None may boast, my son, the seeds of evil habit are dead, never more to quicken. Yet is there something almost converting in maternal love, that, watching over a helpless being, nourishing and guiding an heir of immortality, feels its own infirmity, its own inadequacy to the great work, and pours itself out in utter abandonment, seeking refuge where only it can be found,—above. I rejoice that at length such hopes are hers,—are yours; may God crown and render them effectual. I have been led to say more than I intended, for advancing age warns me that this birthday may be my last. Should it so prove, let this be my parting charge to our dear one:— to put forth all her energies, to guard every avenue of danger, to resist every wile of the tempter; yet not to rely on any earthly helper, but cling ever closely to the Hand that was pierced.” Little could it then have been supposed, while there was such a lingering of the health and even the beauty of early years, around this inestimable friend, that her parting intimation would so soon be verified. Yet ere “another moon had filled its horn,” Frederick Wilson, himself deeply mourning, was called to console his weeping wife, who bent over the lifeless form of one who had been to both as a mother. “She has gone to the angels,” he said. “To the angels, husband, in whose joy even on earth she partook, over the sinner that repenteth.” After the funeral obsequies, it was to them a mournful satisfaction to devise and erect a monument, which should consult both the simplicity of her taste and the impulse of their gratitude. The green turf where her form reposed was surrounded by a beautiful inclosure, and planted with her favorite flowers. At its entrance a willow swept the ground with its long, drooping wands, and over the arched gate crept the ivy, and the clematis with its blue pendulous blossoms. In the centre rose a plain stone of the purest marble. Its only inscription was the name, with the simple dates of birth and death; and beneath, cut deeply into the heart of the stone,— Gone home. On the reverse, two hands, exquisitely sculptured, sprang from the marble, sustaining a vase, with the words “Bring flowers,” enwreathed with acanthus leaves, while its frequent supply of fresh water and the fairest flowers, attested the constancy with which the memory of the dead was cherished. The loss of the hand that had steadily probed her follies, and fostered her virtues, was sincerely deplored by Louisa. Scarcely had the sadness in some measure passed away, ere she was called to become a mother. When she saw her husband press long and earnestly the velvet lip of their first-born, and dividing between it and herself his tearful, enraptured blessings, she felt more than repaid for all the apprehension and agony with which a Being of wisdom hath encompassed the entrance of that holy relationship. The ruling desire of Frederick Wilson's heart was consummated in the first wail of that feeble infant. Not only had his native love of children led him to repine that their union for years had been thus unblessed, but he had secretly depended on the force of maternity to dispel the only shade that darkened the history of his wife. Often had he said mentally, while conflicting with her depraved habit, “Were she but a mother! those cares and joys would be her salvation.” And now the blessing was granted, he was never weary of watching the tender nursling of their hopes, regarding every movement of the tiny limbs, and anticipating the volitions of a mind that was to live forever. It gave him pleasure to believe that it would have the mother's eye of sparkling blue, and to trace the rudiments of his own noble forehead amid its imperfectly developed features. It was interesting to see him so absorbed by this new affection. He was peculiarly gratified that it was a daughter, that its companionship with the mother might be more entire and its influence more permanent. He hailed it as the little angel that had stepped into the troubled pool, to heal the hearts that waited to be whole. It was his first thought at waking, his last when he lay down; and it even had part in his dreams, tinging them with the hue of its own sweet helplessness. The only alloy to his felicity was the physical weakness of Louisa. Some infirmity of constitution left her longer languid and a prisoner than was expected. Both physician and nurse recommended the free use of tonics, to restore her decaying appetite and strength. Tonics involving stimulants! Did they not understand or perceive the baleful fires they were rekindling? But he who did both understand and perceive, interposed, though at the eleventh hour. He forbade all use of what could intoxicate, or its entrance into his house. Louisa was astonished at the spirit which he had manifested. She felt it great unkindness to withhold what she believed she needed, as a restorative to health and the means of affording nourishment to her babe. She became silent and resentful, and was unappeased by his anxious inquiries or affectionate treatment. One evening, while she supposed him to be absent from home, she imagined herself to be alarmingly feeble and in danger of syncope. She therefore directed the nurse to go forth silently, and purchase some of the prohibited beverage, while, propped in her easy chair, she lulled the infant on her bosom. “Poor innocent!” she murmured, “hard that thou must pine for thy natural food, and thy sick mother suffer, because a cruel father denies the medicine that would restore us.” Ere the return of the nurse, her husband entered. What met his horror-struck eyes? His darling child in the fire, and the mother hanging over the arm of her easy chair—asleep! It seems that after the departure of the nurse she had drawn nearer the fire, resting her feet upon the fender. But as the opium-trance deepened, they had slidden from their support, and the precious burden from her arms. Fortunately, the wood was nearly consumed, and being closely wrapped in flannels, its clothes had not ignited. One fair cheek was scorched by the hearth where it lay, but a hand and arm which it had thrust forth from its envelope, came in contact with red coals and decaying brands, and was burned to a crisp. The agony of the father, as he caught the child to his breast, was indescribable. “Woman! See your own work!—the fruit of your accursed, wilful wickedness!” A consultation of surgeons pronounced amputation above the elbow indispensable to life, and it was done. The sufferings of the poor babe, and the hazardous illness that followed, taught the bitterness of remorse to the wretched mother. Its cries of anguish, and her husband's stern adjuration, “Woman! see your own work!” haunted her perpetually. It was long ere that child was out of danger, or the offended husband propitiated. But as health returned to its pallid brow, he began to look on the wasted form of his wife with commiseration. His heart was touched with pity, and alive to tender remembrance; but the respect that is essential to true love had fled forever. This she perceived, and no longer desired to live. The idea that he despised her took possession of her imagination, and poisoned the springs of life. The love that had for years been the pole-star of her existence had shrouded itself. She was not content to gather up the scatered coals from its forsaken altar, and be thankful they were not wholly extinguished; and quicken them with the breath of the patient heart, and pour incense upon them that might have ascended to heaven. No; she could be satisfied only with its first fervor, and that could return no more. She no longer put forth any effort to resist, scarcely to disguise her infirmity. She desperately strove to drown her sorrow in the blood of the grape; to consume it in the fire of distilled liquors; to stagnate it in the sleep of the poppy. Her husband ceased to oppose the current of her depraved appetite. This, also, appeared to her unkindness, for she construed it into indifference. Maternal love, in her nature, seemed an element of secondary power. It had fallen on an ill-prepared, perverted soil. It had come up like a plant under the storm-cloud, blighted ere it could take deep root. The lisping word “mother,”—that talisman of all tender emotion, sometimes awoke a thrilling, delicious tear, but that lost arm was a perpetual reproof, bringing anew the sound of those terrible words, “Woman! see your own work!” Short and sad was the remaining annal of her days. One morning in the midst of her lofty parlor, she fell, and rose not. She was borne to her chamber and bed, where she breathed heavily, but spoke not. Long did her coach, which she had ordered, stand in waiting at her gate; for none of those who had hurried in and out,— physicians, neighbors or domestics, remembered to say to the coachman,—“The mistress is dead!” In an inner room, haggard with grief, sat the disconsolate husband, his mutilated child upon his knee. At the deep sound of the funeral bell, he put the little one from him, that he might kneel for the last time amid the voice of prayer, by her side whom prayer would no longer avail, and look for the last time on that bloated, discolored face, once so beautiful. As years passed on it was touching to see that melancholy man, in his rich saloon, his spacious garden or his favorite library, ever holding by her only hand his only child, ever breathing into her ear precepts of wisdom, ever pouring, as it were, the whole wealth of a sorrowing, loving spirit into her tender bosom. From no effort of duty or work of benevolence did he withdraw himself, but the brightness of existence was gone forever; and in his most cheerful moments, he was as one who had seen the idol of his youth borne away by some black-winged monster into outer darkness.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCORN NOT THE ERRING. Scorn not the erring,—though her name Should dregs of deep abhorrence stir; Even though the kindling blush of shame Burns deep on Virtue's cheek for her. Judge not,—unless thy lip can tell What wily tempter, fierce and strong, Did the unguarded soul propel To ruin's hidden gulf along. The downward road, how fearful steep! The upward cliff, how hard to climb!— He only knows, whose records keep The nameless, countless grades of crime. Scorn not the erring,—thou whose heart, In purpose pure is garnered strong:— Claims penitence with thee no part? Doth pride to mortal man belong?

      <field name="fulltext">THE TOMB OF CECILIA METELLA. AT ROME. Here sleep'st thou, wife of Crassus? Thy proud tomb O'ermastereth Time,—mocking with mighty walls, And Doric frieze, and knots of sculptured flowers, His ill-dissembled wrath. Soft, drooping shades,— The dark, columnar cypress, the fair leaves Of the young olive, and the ivy wreath Close clustering, lend their tracery to enrich Thy sepulchre. Yet hast thou left no trace On History's tablet; and in vain we ask Yon voiceless stones of thee. Was hoarded wealth Thine idol, like thy husband's? Didst thou vaunt His venal honors, and exalt the power Of the triumvir,—in thy purple robes Presiding at his feasts,—to every lip Pressing the goblet, even while Rome was sick With pomp and revel?—Or in secret cell, To thy Penates breath the pagan prayer In trembling, for his sake?—Or last in weeds Of solitary widowhood, deplore His breathless bosom pierced by Parthian darts? There is no record on you massy walls, Of thy last deeds. Even thy sarcophagus Is rifled, and the golden urn that locked Thy mouldering ashes, proved but fitting bribe For the bold robber. Thy Patrician dust— How doth it differ from the household slave's, Who, 'neath thy bidding, at the distaff wrought? Or doomed to sterner toil, in ponderous vase Bore the cool Martian waters for thy wine? How vain to question thus thy gorgeous tomb, False to its trust! The thick-ribb'd arch of rock Lays claim to immortality; but dust,— Man's dust, must yield each element a part, To pay Creation's loan. Nor can he cling! To the brief memory of his shadowy race, Save through his deeds. Oh woman!—nurse of man! Make not thy bed beneath the imposing arch, Or sky-crowned pyramid. Enshrine thyself, With all thy buried virtues, in the heart Of him who loves thee. Be thine epitaph The graces of thine offspring, and the thanks Of those who mourn. So shalt thou miss the pomp Of this world's triumph, and thy noteless grave Be glorious at the resurrection morn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE UPAS TREE. There sprang a tree of deadly name, Its poisonous breath, its baleful dew, Scorched the green earth, like lava-flame, And every plant of mercy slew. From clime to clime its branches spread Their fearful fruits of sin and woe,— The prince of darkness loved its shade, And toiled its fiery seed to sow. Faith poured her prayer at midnight hour, The hand of zeal at noonday wrought, And armor of celestial power The children of the Cross besought. Behold! the axe its pride shall wound, Through its cleft boughs the sunbeams shine, Its blasted blossoms strew the ground,— Give glory to the Arm Divine! And still Jehovah's aid implore, From isle to isle, from sea to sea:— From peopled earth's remotest shore, To root that deadly Upas Tree.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A WALK IN CHILDHOOD. “There was a time, when meadow, grove and stream, The earth, and every common sight, To me did seem Apparelled in a wondrous light, The glory, and the freshness of a dream!” Wordsworth. When my years were few, I loved to sit under the shadow of gray rugged rocks, and listen to the falling waters. I learned to know where the first violets sprang, and where the lily of the valley hid behind its broad leaf; and where the forest nuts ripen, when the frost sparkles upon the earth. I saw the squirrel putting acorns in his nest for the winter, and where the bee stores the essence, which singing, she wins from the flowers. I sought to draw forth the kindness of domestic animals, and to know the names of the birds that yearly built in my father's trees. But of my own race, who have the gift of reason, with dominion over the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, I knew little; save of the parents who nurtured me, and the few children with whom I had sometimes played on the summer turf. I said, “If the plant that flourishes only a few days is happy, and the bird that bears to its young a single broken cherry, and the poor lamb that has no friend but its mother; how much happier must they be whom God hath made to rule over them, and who are surrounded by good things like a flowing river, and who know that when they seem to die, it is but to live forever.” So I desired to turn away from the herbs of the field, and look more attentively upon the ways of men. Once, I was permitted to walk abroad, when the dews of the morning were fresh upon the grass, and all the things of nature seemed beautiful, and full of love. A group of children were in the streets. Methought they were unwashed, and unfed. They clamored loudly, with idle tongues. I asked them why they went not to the schools, where knowledge was gathered. But they mocked at me, and hasted away. Two neighbors met each other. They were called friends; but they spake loud, and angry words. Then they quarrelled, and I was frightened at the blows they dealt. I saw a man with a fiery face. He was tall, and strongly built, like the oak among the trees. Yet were his steps unsteady as those of the tottering babe. He lifted up a hoarse foolish song, like a creature without understanding. Then he reeled, and fell heavily, as one dead. I marvelled that no hand was stretched to raise him up. Again I walked forth, by the silent valley where the dead repose. A coffin was let down into an open grave. 8 At its brink stood a widowed woman, with her little ones. They looked sad, and bowed with trouble; yet, methought, on their shrivelled brows the marks of famine were deeper set than the seal of sorrow for the dead. Then I asked in my wonder, “What made the parents not pity their children when they hungered, nor call them home when they were in wickedness? What made the friends forget their first love? and the strong man fall down senseless? and the young die before his time?” Then a voice answered, “Intemperance! And there is mourning in the land because of this.” So I returned to my home sorrowing. And had God given me a brother or sister, I would have thrown my arms around their neck, and entreated, “Touch not your lips to the poison-cup; but let us drink the pure water, which God hath blessed, all the days of our lives.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I SAW A LITTLE GIRL. SONG FOR CHILDREN. I SAW a little girl, With half uncovered form, And wondered why she wandered thus Amid the winter storm. They said her mother drank of that Which took her sense away, And so, she let her children roam Unheeded, day by day. I saw them take a man To prison for his crime, Where solitude, and punishment, And toil divide the time. And as they led him through the gate Unwillingly along, They told me 'twas intemperance, That made him do the wrong. 6* I saw a woman weep, As though her heart would break;— They said her husband drank too much Of what he should not take. I saw an unfrequented mound, Where weeds and brambles wave;— On which had fallen no mourning tear,— It was the drunkard's grave. They said these were not all The risks the intemperate run,— For there was danger, lest the soul Be evermore undone. Since crystal water is so sweet, And beautiful to see, And never leads to harm or woe, It is the drink for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DEATH OF KING EDMUND. The Saxon Edmund, reigned o'er Albion's isle, Nine centuries since. Scarce had the ruddy bloom Of seventeen summers ripened on his cheek, Ere he was called to try the toils that wait A ruler of rude men. Though his young heart At times, remembered with a thrill of pride His grandsire Alfred,—justly styled the Great, Yet was it idly wont to rest its claim More on ancestral virtues, than its own, Boastful of buried glory. Still, he earned From his barbaric dynasty, the name Of the Magnificent, and the fierce crews Of pirate Danes, vexing the British shores, Confessed his prowess; while his penal codes Peopled the gibbets with those robber hordes Who long had foraged on the rifled wealth Of weaker neighbors. Thus, the years flowed on, Till the seventh winter saw the envied crown Still on his brow. Once, at a royal feast Around his board, the warriors, and the thanes He gathered; while with savage mirth they drain'd, The mighty goblet, smiting on their shields In chorus, as the scalds some favorite lay Uplifted, of old heroes. Deep, the king Drank of the flowing mead, and gazing round In fiery exultation, fixed his eye Amid the distant dimness of the hall, Upon a banished outlaw. “Hence!” he cried, “Dar'st thou to scorn my sentence, and return?— Hence, from my sight!” But still, the muffled man Moved not, and scowling 'neath his bushy locks With careless credence, or defiance cold, Gave insolent regard. So, from his seat The frantic monarch leaping, mad with wine, Closed with the ruffian, though a dagger flash'd Like lightning, and the royal bosom felt The keenness of its point.— One moment, high Spouted the red heart's blood,—the next, there lay A frowing corse. Thus, Saxon Edmund fell, Whom men called king, but Wisdom deems a slave To appetite and passion. He who boasts His liberty, yet wears their secret chain, Doth bow to darker servitude and shame Than even the serf he scorns. Giver of grace, Instruct us with our earliest years to blend Meekness and temperance, and so 'scape the snare Of keen remorse, and guilt that hath no hope.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE EMIGRANT BRIDE. “Fare ye well! Fare ye well!— To joy and to hope it sounds as a knell;— Cruel tale it were to tell How the emigrant sighs farewell!”— Tupper. Two, rather antique-looking people were conversing cozily, towards the close of a vernal day. The bowwindow where they sate looked out upon lawn and garden, and was partially shaded by the twining convolvulus, which at dewy morn was redolent of its deepblue and crimson bells. “Brother, did you ever think our Susan had some thoughts she did not reveal?” “What kind of thoughts?” “Why, has it never crossed your mind, that she might be in love?” “In love? The child! What can you be dreaming about, sister Sibyl?” “Child indeed! Eighteen next candlemas, Mr Mortimer. If I am not mistaken, her mother was younger, when she stood at the altar with our brother. Perhaps I might say, when she led him there, for he was utterly bewildered, and blinded by the love of her.” “She was truly lovely. But tell me, whose image your imaginings have coupled with our pretty niece?” “Whose image? why, the young spark, Henry Elton, of course. A fine match, upon my word; he having nothing, or next to nothing, and of no family, as you may say. I always thought Susan ought to marry some nobleman. And so she might, with a proper ambition. Such sights of money as you have lavished on her education too, playing on the spinet and working tent-stich. Of what great use will such fine things be, when she is the wife of so very undistinguished a personage? I think she is ungrateful to you,—indeed, to us both.” “It is most probable that your fancy outruns all fact. Still, if your suspicions prove true, I should regret it, not so much for the reason you have given, as that the young man has some spice of wildness, and want of consideration, which might affect the happiness of the poor girl. Shall I speak to her?” “Oh mercy, my dear brother! not for the world. You men are always so hasty. Such matters need the utmost tact and delicacy. The young heart is an exquisite harp, which few can play upon, without disordering its strings. Trust that to me. There she is, coming from her walk, and that very Henry Elton with her, to be sure! Have the goodness, brother, to leave the room. No time like present time, as the proverb says.” A fair girl was seen approaching the house, the rich curls of auburn hair escaping from under her hat, and shading neck and shoulder. By her side was a graceful young man, who bore upon his arm her basket of wild flowers. A ramble in the green lanes of merry England had given them new spirits, and their voices, mingled with occasional laughter, rang out joyously. Her companion took leave, and she entered with a light step,— “See, aunt, these fresh violets, and this,”— “Bless me! Miss Mortimer. I suppose it is highly decorous to walk with your hat untied, and to chatter so long at the gate with a gentleman.” Amazement seized the young creature, a moment since so gay. Miss Mortimer! This was always an epithet of great displeasure. What could have happened? The full, blue eyes, which just before had sparkled like saphires, dilated, and with lips slightly parted, and foot advanced, she stood, checked and silent,—a song-bird startled by the thunder. “Do you know that everybody is talking of your familiarity with that Henry Elton, and of his awful dissipation too? Your uncle, and all,”— “My dear aunt!” “Yes! dear aunt, indeed! Your uncle is not quite blind, nor deaf either. Poor man! he might have had higher hopes for his favorite brother's daughter. So liberal too, as he has always been,—no expense spared. It is a burning shame, to show no more regard to his feelings.” “I assure you, aunt!”— “You need not assure me at all,—I'm able to assure myself. But if you do not see fit to give up Henry Elton, and mate yourself with some titled person, or one more fitting for our family, it will not be so well for you, I can assure you of that. It will not be difficult to find one who will show more gratitude to us, for lesser favors. You need not take the trouble to answer me.” The surprise of the listener gave way to a rush of other feelings. The color deepened in her pure Saxon complexion, but she replied not; though the compression of her bright lip, proved that it cost some effort to be silent. Henceforth a new subject occupied her meditation, and the floating filament and shadow of a preference, became a fixed thought. Miss Sibyl lost no time in reporting to her brother, that Susan was deeply in love, and desperately bent on having her own way. “I could see it in every movement. She is her mother over again,—whom I never could bear. Her father, too, had a right obstinate temper. Considering he was only a half-brother, I have sometimes wondered at your partiality for his daughter. I am sure our own dear sister would be glad to give us her Euphemia, who would not make us half the trouble that Susan has.” This matter had been hinted before by the adroit lady, but her brother's heart still continued to turn to his orphan protégé. Yet having always maintained towards her a reserved and dignified manner, she was not aware of his attachment, and native timidity prevented her approaching him with freedom. Mutually misunderstanding each other, constraint deepened into apparent coldness, and diffidence was mistaken for pride. The blight of a joyless home fell on the spirit of the young girl, and she grew careworn, before her time. Days passed away on leaden feet, and the early flowers for whose birth she had waited, withered unnoticed in their turfy beds. At the foot of the pleasant garden of the Mortimers, was a summer-house. The full moon, looking through its vines and lattice-work, saw it not untenanted. Two persons were discoverable, with heads declined, as if in conversation more profound than the gayety of youth would prompt. Suddenly, one starts into action, genuflection, gesture, such as excited feeling, or eloquence inspire. It might be seen that he has an auditor absorbed, and not unmoved. The pantomime, though protracted, has a close. Of its scope and result, somewhat may be gathered by the bearing of the parties, as they issue from the bower. Moving slowly through the long lines of shrubbery, the manner of one is earnest, tender, and tinctured with the power of prevalence. The other leans heavily on his arm, her fair brow inclining towards his; and as they reach the porch where they are to separate, her clear, lustrous eye gazes steadfastly into his, as if to gather one more assurance, that the image of her own love is fully reflected there. A ship rides at anchor on an English coast. The night is rayless, and winds moan with a hollow sound. The midnight watch is called; but the captain still lingers on deck, as if engaged in some preparation for his expected departure at early morn. The tramp of flying steeds is heard on the shore. Then the dash of an oar,—a boat has put forth into the thick darkness. Soon a group, muffled in cloaks, ascend the deck of the vessel. One seems exhausted, and is supported by a stronger arm. Then, by the dull red light of the binnacle, a cavalier stands forth with uncovered head, and by his side a vision of beauty. The melody of the marriage service trembles strangely upon that bleak, midnight air. Hands are joined,—“Till death us do part.” What a place,—timid and tender creature! for vows like these,—the rough ship, and the tossing sea. None of thy kindred blood near to bless thee, or soothe the pulsations of thy fluttering heart! “Safe from all persecution!—Mine own forever!” Well-timed words, young bridegroom. They bring a faint rose-leaf tinge over cheek and brow, so deadly pale. The benediction of the priest fell, like oil upon the troubled waters; and throwing himself, with his attendants, into the waiting boat, he rapidly regained the shore. The next morning beheld the ship, and her companions, with unfurled sails leave the harbor of Plymouth. Cloud and blast had passed away with night, but were replaced by a dense fog. So they still hovered, like half-wakened sea-birds, lazily along the coast. At midday, a barge was seen approaching. With a buoyant movement it skimmed the waves, now rising half upright upon some crested billow, and anon, sinking gracefully into the intermediate vale of waters. Among the many who watched its progress, none testified such overwhelming anxiety as Henry Elton, and his bride. Apprehension that they might be the objects of pursuit, raised a tide of tumultuous emotion. The young man walked apart with the captain, vehemently demanding that the ship should hold on her course. And when he again seated himself by her side, whose azure eye followed his every movement,—an unsheathed weapon was observed to glitter beneath his mantle. A cavalier closely muffled, with a single servant, leaped on board. Requesting a private interview with the captain, they descended together to the cabin. Henry Elton, passing one arm firmly around his bride, whispered in her ear, “Till death us do part!” while a sword gleamed in his right hand. How endless seemed that interval of suspense. At length ascending footsteps were heard, with a suppressed murmur of “Sir Walter Raleigh!” The eye of every gazer testified pleasure, as it rested on the noble form of the most accomplished knight of his times. His Spanish cloak, thrown over one arm, discovered that magnificence of costume in which he delighted, and which his elegance of person so well became. To all who surrounded him, he addressed some kind or courtly phrase, with his habitual tact and fluency. Fixing his eagle eye on the bride, he drew her towards him, and said,— “And thou too, here, pretty Dove? I knew thy father well, in the Low Countries. A brave man was he and a noble. Heaven help thee to build thy nest in you far flowery groves, where I would fain myself be.” Pressing a paternal kiss on her pure forehead, and once more heartily shaking the hand of the commander, he said,— “My good people, that you will show all due respect and obedience to so excellent a seaman as Captain White, I make no doubt. But more than this,—I present him to you as the future Governor of the colony which, God willing, you are to plant in the new Western World.” Then placing in his hand a sealed paper, containing instructions for the new government, and the names of the twelve assistants by whose aid it was to be administered,—he bade all a courteous farewell, with “good wishes, and a golden lot.” Loud and long was the voice of cheer and gratulation, as he departed. Bowing his thanks, and then standing erect in the tossing boat, he waved his hat with its fair white plumes. Far in the distance they saw it dancing amid the sea-foam, and conversed enthusiastically of the man, who yet scarcely thirty-five, had already become illustrious in arts and arms,—a scholar, courtier, poet and statesman, liberal as a patron of literature, and the very soul of all enterprise for the settlement of the new-found continent of America. As they watched him, until his barge was a speck on the far waters, no prescience revealed the darkening of his fortunes:—the conspiracy of his foes, a tyrant king, the prison, and the scaffold. Three small ships, long beaten by the Atlantic surge, approached the shores of that region which, less than a century before, the world-finder had unveiled. The conflict of months with blast and billow had not left them unscathed, and they moved heavily, like the flagging seagull, towards the desired haven. It was the summer of 1587, when Virginia, in her gorgeous robes, gleamed out to the worn voyagers like the isles of the blessed. Her flowering trees and shrubs, sent a welcome on the wings of odors, ere the embroidered turf kissed their feet. Vines, loaded with clusters, enriched field and grove; here forming dense canopies and bowers of shade, and there springing loftily from tree-top to tree-top, with bold festoons and flowing drapery. Deer glanced through the forest, and birds of gay plumage filled the balmy air with music. The strangers sought out the spot, near the bright waters of the Roanoake, where, two years before, Sir Richard Grenville had planted a colony of frail root, whose remnant had been borne back by Sir Francis Drake, to its native soil. These guests of the hospitality of the broad, green West, were full of exultation, and zealous to construct places of shelter and repose. None more ardently rejoiced, when a little dwelling was ready, which they might call their own, than Henry Elton and his bride. Its rudeness, its narrow limits were nought to them, so entirely happy were they to possess a home amid the charms of nature and the solitude of love. Here was their most romantic wish fulfilled,—a lodge in the green wood, and a beautiful world to themselves. Alas for Susan, when a change stole over her dream! Enthusiastic, and turning, like the flower of the sun, to one alone, she had not taken into view that the cloud and the frost must have their season. At first, she wondered that Henry could so often leave her, and so long be gone; or that, at his return, he omitted the tender words she had been accustomed to her. But the smile was ever radiant on her brow when he appeared; and during his absence, she found solace in household toils, putting her slender, snowy hands, with strange facility, to the humblest deeds that might render a poor abode comfortable, or vary his repast who was ever first in her thoughts. While thus employed, her voice rang out sweetly from the catalpas that embowered her dwelling, so that it would seem that the birds and herself were at a loving strife. But the tuneful emulation ceased, and her song rose sad and seldom,—and then was heard no more. A deeper shadow had fallen upon her lot. Captiousness was added to indifference, by him for whom she had literally given up all beside. A fearful conviction, which she strongly resisted, forced itself upon her, of his frequent intemperance. Careless of the duties of a protector, he would sometimes be away whole nights; while at his return, she was doomed to witness the disgusting gradations from stupidity to brutality. Compunction, indeed, occasionally seized him; and at his reviving kindness, her young hope comforted her that all would yet be well, and her woman's love forgot that it had ever wept. The adversities of the colony proved also a temporary remedy. Poverty, and a scarcity of the means of subsistence, checked the power of revelry, and drove the inebriate to abstinence. Some fear of savage warfare drew the little band more firmly together, for consultation and safety. The fierce Wingina, with his followers, were observed prowling around the settlement. There was then no Powhatan to succor the strangers,— no Pocahontas to save the victim, at the jeopardy of her own life. In the meantime, she who had staked her all on love, and lost, was tenacious of its fragments. Every pleasant look or gentle word, though few and far between, was treasured as an equivalent for many sorrows. She was learning, day by day, the lesson that human love may 7 never lay aside the element of forbearance. It was touching to see so young and fair a creature, so mournful, and yet so calm. One evening, she had waited long for her husband, but he came not. This was but too common, since he had become the slave of intemperance. A step was heard. Can that be his?—so stealthy? The slight fastening of the door was burst in. Dark faces peered— wild forms glimmered. The stroke of a hatchet, and the red flame bursting from the low roof-tree, were the work of a moment;—and from the girdle of the tallest warrior, when he strode from the spoil, hung a scalp, with a dripping, auburn tress. That night, the wail of a wretched man was heard over the ashes—and the dead. Daybreak beheld him, with others, armed, and going forth in quest of vengeance. The fires of wrath fell on many a quiet wigwam, and innocent women and babes perished for the crime of their chieftain. Such is the justice of the war-spirit; blind, bloody, and ferocious. Three years notched their seasons on the trees, and threw their shadows over the earth, ere England stretched forth her hand to that far, forsaken colony. Then, three storm-driven vessels, as the dog-star commenced his reign, were seen contending with the terrible breakers of Cape Hatteras. Outriding both surge and tempest, at length, with strained cordage and riven sails, they neared the shore. They fired signal-guns, and anxiously listened,—but there was no sound. They pressed on towards Roanoke, Governor White, who had been absent on an agency to England, taking the lead. Where was his sweet daughter Ellinor, whom he had left in her green-wood home, singing the lullaby to her young babe, Virginia, the first born of English parents in the new Western World? As he drew near the spot, he kept his eye fixed, with agonizing earnestness, on a copse of lofty pines that had encircled her habitation. Smoke reared its curling volume among them, and his heart leaped up.—It was the smouldering council-fire of the Indians. Not a home of civilized man was there,—not a form or face of kindred or of friend. They call. There is no answer but echo, murmuring from rock and ravine. Names and initials are still cut deeply on the trees. But where are the hands that traced them? All is silence,—save the steps of those who search, and the sighs of those who mourn. By the shore there was no boat,—over some broken oars, grass and weeds had crept. Ruins of former abodes were here and there visible:—portions of household utensils, and implements of agriculture, scattered along the sands and corroded with moisture. Mingled with them were fragments of chests, torn charts, and mutilated books. Among the latter was a thrilling relic. A Bible, with the name of “Susan Mortimer Elton,” covered with sanguine spots. Ah! were those fair eyes resting upon that blessed book, when the destroyer came? Was she there gathering strength for her thorn-clad journey, when that journey was about to close? Sacred pages! did she learn from you, that earthly love without divine, is unsafe for the heirs of immortality? When her heart's idol was broken, did she hearken to your whisper, “Come, weary, heavy-laden, and I will give thee rest?” Blood-stained Bible, from Virginian sands! we thank thee for thine enduring friendship,—for thy last holy offices to the Emigrant Bride.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">INTEMPERANCE AT SEA. “Again, unto the wreck they came, Where like one dead, I lay, And a ship-boy small had strength enough To carry me away.” Howitt. The evils of intemperance at sea, it is impossible for any pen adequately to describe. The oaths, the quarrels, the debasing vices that it occasions among sailors, may in some measure be imagined by what is seen on land. But the narrow limits to which they are confined, allow no opportunity of concealment, and more immediately extinguish all moral sensibility. There are no dark lanes, in which to sleep off their debauch,—no home to which they may stagger, and in the misery inflicted on wife and children, hide awhile their sin from the public eye. All is open and shameless. But the sufferings inflicted on passengers by the intemperance of those to whom they have intrusted their property and lives,—the wrecks that have ensued by a helm badly steered, or wrong orders from those who have tarried over the bowl until the storm was high—the multitudes thus torn from sorrowing friends, and buried in watery graves, can never be known or told, till the seas give up their dead. 7* It was early during the war that severed the United States from Great Britain, that an armed vessel sailed out of Boston. The day before Christmas was the time fixed for her departure; and though some hearts were sad at not being able to keep that sacred festival with loved ones, seated around the pleasant household board, yet it was a proud sight, when she spread her white sails to the morning sun, and steered from the harbor of Plymouth. She was not large, but strongly built, and balanced herself beautifully amid the waves, like a bird cutting the air. She carried twenty guns, and a crew of more than one hundred, with provisions for a cruise of six months. There were moistened eyes, and a waving of handkerchiefs from the shore, as she weighed anchor and departed. For she bore as goodly a company of bold and skilful seamen, as ever braved the perils of the deep. While she hovered round the coast, the skies became troubled, and the north wind blowing heavily, brought a rough sea into the bay. Night came on with thick darkness. The strong gale that buffeted them became a blast. and the blast a hurricane. Snow drifted through the clouds, and the cold grew exceedingly severe. The vessel was tossed by the merciless waves, until she struck a reef of rocks. Beginning to fill with water, they hasted to cut away her masts. But the sea rose above the main deck, and the wild surges swept over it. Every exertion was made that courage could prompt, or hardihood sustain; but so fearful were the winds, and so piercing the cold, that the stoutest men were unable to labor, exposed to their influence but a short time without being relieved by others. When they found all their efforts to save the vessel hopeless, they thronged together upon the quarter-deck,—not to bewail their hapless condition, neither to entreat mercy of God, like men on the verge of eternity. Unfortunately, they had got access to the stores of ardent spirits, and many of them were, even then, in a state of intoxication. Insubordination and mutiny ensued. The officers remained clear-minded, but lost all authority over the sailors, who raved around them like madmen. The darkened sky, the raging storm, the waves breaking against the rocks, and threatening to ingulf the broken vessel, and the half-frozen beings who maintained a feeble hold on life, breathing imprecations instead of prayers, formed a scene truly frightful. Some of the inebriated wretches lay in disgusting stupidity,—others, with fiery faces, blasphemed their Maker. Some, wild with delirium, fancied themselves in palaces, surrounded by luxury, and abused the imaginary servants, who refused to do their bidding. Others, amid the beating of that pitiless tempest, believed themselves to be in the homes which they were never more to see, and with hoarse reproachful voices, asked for bread, and wondered why the refreshing water-draught was withheld from them, by those who were most dear. A few, whose worst passions alcohol had inflamed to fiend-like fury, assaulted all who came in their way, raising their shouts of defiance above the roar of the tempest. While intemperance was displaying itself in the most revolting attitudes, Death began his work. Every hour, some miserable creature fell dead upon the deck, frozen stiff and hard, in the extreme wintry cold. Each corpse, as it became breathless, was dragged to the heap of dead, that there might be more room for the living. Those who had drank most freely, were the first to perish. On the third day of these horrors, some boats that had boldly ventured from the harbor of Plymouth, reached the wreck, amid many dangers from breakers and the storm. The hardy mariners were horror-struck at the scene that presented itself. Corpses, stiffened into every form that suffering could devise, were strewed around. Some were piled in a mass together, like the frozen soldiers, on the retreat from Moscow. Others sate with heads bent to their knees; others, in their dead hands; grasped the ice-covered ropes, or the empty spirit-cup, while some, in a posture of defiance, or defence, glared like the sculptured gladiator. Every sign of life was earnestly sought for. One boy was about to be thrown among the mass of dead, when it was discovered that one of his eyelids faintly trembled, and he was saved. The survivors were borne to the shore, and the strangers kindly sheltered and nursed by the inhabitants, until they could be removed to their own homes. It was found that only a small band, besides the officers of the vessel, had abstained from ardent spirits. These survived the hardships of the storm and the wreck, though some of them were in a state of exhaustion. The angel of Temperance, like the Prophet with his censer, literally stood “between the living and the dead, so that the plague was stayed.” Some, who had been less deeply intoxicated, were borne to the land alive, but died in a short time. Others, after long sickness, were restored, but with impaired strength, or mutilated frames. When the tempest subsided, the boats again approached the wreck, to remove the dead. What a solemn sight,— as under a clear, wintry sky, they slowly bore over the heaving waters, the bodies of those who had so recently parted from their friends, in health and exulting hope! Their funeral obsequies were mournful beyond description. Nearly one hundred bodies were placed in the little church, fixing their stony immovable eyes upon the beholder, their features hardened into horrible expressions of the last mortal agony. The aged Pastor fainted at the sight of this terrible congregation. He soon recovered himself, but his voice was mournful and tremulous, as he performed the last sacred services of religion. The bodies not claimed by friends for separate graves, were interred in a large pit on the south-east side of the burial ground. And after that generation had faded away, the spot was still pointed out to strangers, where the perished crew of that lost vessel await the resurrection. Near by, in a humble abode, might have been seen a pale-faced widow, with her young daughter, sedulously attending the couch of a sufferer. The boy lay there, whose trembling eyelid had saved him on the wreck, among the dead. “Mother! it was you who taught me to avoid whatever would intoxicate. Your lessons have saved my life. When my poor comrades became drunk around me, it was as much as I could do to protect myself from them. Some dared me to fight, and struck me. Others held strong liquors to my lips, and bade me drink. My throat was burning, and my tongue parched with thirst. But I knew if I drank, I must lose my reason like them, and blaspheme Him who made me. “One by one they fell down, those reeling and maddened people. Even now, their shouts and groans ring in my ears. It was in vain that our officers, and a few good men among us, warned them of the fate that would befall them, and tried to establish order. They persisted in swallowing draught after draught, until they grew delirious, and died in heaps. “Our sufferings from hunger and cold, were dreadful. After my feet were frozen, but before I lost the use of my hands, I saw a box under water, among fragments of the wreck. I tried with a rope to bring it up, hoping that it might contain bread. But my weakened arms failed, and a comrade helped me. After long toil, it came within our reach, and we succeeded in bursting it open. Alas! there was no bread there, only a few bottles of olive-oil. Yet for these, in our famished condition we were thankful. Now and then we moistened our lips with a few drops of the oil; and even found, that to swallow a small quantity, allayed the severe gnawing pains of hunger. “But soon my comrade died, and I lay beside him, benumbed and helpless. Then the roar of the tempest lulled, and I heard strange voices as if in a dream, and the hurrying feet of those blessed people, who had dared every danger to rescue us. They carefully wrapped in blankets all who were able to speak, or whose slightest motion betrayed life. Almost every drunkard was among the dead. “And I was so exhausted with labor, and cold, and want of food, that I was not able to utter a word, or stretch a finger to my deliverers. Again and again, they passed me, where I lay among the dead. Again and again, they bore the living away to their boats. A terrible dread took possession of me, lest I should be left behind. I strained every nerve and muscle to speak, but could utter no sound. The effort almost stifled my feeble breath. I strove to lift my hand. All power over the muscles had forsaken me. It was like some awful vision. “Then I prayed agonizingly in my heart: `For the sake of my poor mother and sister, Oh Lord, save me!' Methought the last man had gone, for I heard no longer any footsteps. Then I said, `Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!' “Ah! was there not something like a warm breath on my cheek? Was not the hand of a human being laid upon mine? My whole soul strove and shuddered within me; but my body was immovable as marble. A voice said, `I think this poor lad lives;—one of his eyelids trembles.' Oh, the music of those words! It was not the trembling eyelid, but your lessons of temperance, dear mother, and the prayer to God, that saved me.” Then the loving sister ran with tears to embrace him, and the widowed mother, bowing her head, said,— “I thank thee, Merciful Father, who hath spared my son, to be the comfort of my age.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE STORM. 'Twas a wild night.— November's storm was out Upon the murky hills, and at its stroke The naked forest groaned. 'Twas a wild night— Yet mid the conflict of the howling winds, The mother's quick ear caught another sound, Faint though it was,—for when was love, like hers, Deaf to its wailing child! With flying steps She sought a distant chamber. There her son, Roused by the thunder of the elements From his sweet dream, inquir'd, with pallid cheek, O'er which his shining curls dishevell'd swept, The meaning of such tumult. So she placed Her lamp upon the table, and sate down Beside his little bed. “That sound you hear, Like a hoarse roaring, is the swollen brook Beating against the stones. For sudden rains Have raised it brimming to its slender bridge,— And had the violets that you love so well Not hidden from the frost, they'd all been drown'd With their young baby buds.— And then that knock Against the rattling casement, that is sure The stiff old cedar, frightened at the storm, Who spreads his green hands o'er the window panes, As if to ask for help. Those whistling tones,— Half cry, half tune,—are from some wandering blast That sweeps our chimney, and its funnel tall Maketh an organ pipe.” “Oh, mother dear! Waking so suddenly, I scarce could think What this great uproar meant. But well I know God rules the storm.” “Thou dost remember right Thy Sunday lesson, and apply it well. But here, while in thy nicely-curtained crib With downy pillows thou art nestled warm, Like a young birdling, still bethink thee, boy, Of the poor traveller 'neath the chilling rain; And of the sailor on the slippery mast, And of the wrecking ship amid the waves; And thank our Bounteous Father in your prayer.” “Mother, I heard the story of a man, One, who was cruel to his helpless child, And drove his wife out in the wintry cold,— They said it was the wine and SPIRIT STORM Made him so bad. Mother, what storm was that?” “The storm that may be kindled in ourselves, My little son, by strong and evil drinks; Which wake a wilder tempest in the breast Than that which troubleth nature. Then the son Respecteth not his parents,—nor the wife Loveth her little ones. And men forget The fear of God, and do such deeds as tears Can never wash away.— The glorious sun Will shine again as bright as if the storm Had never been, and thou, perchance, may'st see The arch of radiant colors throw its tint Upon the passing cloud. But that dark storm Of fearful passions, hath no blessed bow Of promise for the soul.” “I will not be So wicked, mother, as to drink what makes Such tempests in the bosom.—Mother, dear! I never will.” And then he pressed his lip, Sobbing with earnestness, upon her cheek, While tenderly she said,— “Keep thou this pledge, Oh true, and tender heart! And when the days Of manhood come, and thou art tempted sore, Still gird thy promise to a faithful breast, And hold thy footing firm. So shalt thou bless, Even in such dialect as angels use, Thy mother's visit, and this midnight storm.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SAILOR'S APPEAL. Ho! dwellers on the stable land, Of danger what know ye, Like us who brave the whelming surge, Or trust the treacherous sea? The fair trees shade you from the sun, You see the harvests grow, And breathe the fragrance of the breeze When the first roses blow. You slumber on your beds of down, Close wrapped, in chambers warm, Lulled only to a deeper dream By the descending storm:— While high amid the slippery shroud, We make our midnight path,— And e'en the strongest mast is bowed Beneath the tempest's wrath. Yet still, what know ye of the joy That lights our ocean strife, When on its way our gallant ship Rides like a thing of life? When gayly toward the wished-for port With favoring wind we stand, Or first your misty line descry, Hills of our native land! Know ye what danger waits our souls, When, in that narrow bound, The fiend Intemperance fiercely breathes His fiery breath around? No angel-comforters are near, Our tempted hearts to stay,— No blessed charities of home To check our downward way. There's deadly peril in our path Beyond the wrecking blast,— A peril that may reach the soul When life's short voyage is past. Send us your Bibles when we go To dare the whelming wave,— Your men of peace, to teach us how To meet a watery grave. And Saviour! thou whose foot sublime The foaming surge did tread,— Whose hand, the rash disciple drew From darkness and the dead,— Oh! be our Ark when floods descend, When thunders shake the spheres,— Our Ararat when tempests end, And the green earth appears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">8 THE HARWOODS. “'Tis she alone, with her constant heart, Can see all the idols of hope depart, Yet still live on.—and smile, and bless Man in his utmost wretchedness.” Procter. The flood of emigration which beats against the shores of the United States, seems to have no ebb-tide. From the ices of the Baltic,—from the dense forests of Germany,—from the weeping Isle of the shamrock, exhalations gather, hurrying drops aggregate, streamlets mingle, and press onward with a rushing sound. The young West, like some broad sea, receives them, taking no more note of each than Ocean of its tribute-waters. Here and there, in the streets of our cities, the tall, tasseled cap of the Pole, the rainbow plaid of the High-lander, or the thin smoke curling from the Bavarian pipe, gleam for a moment, to be dispersed in measureless distance, or merged in one common mass. The accents of a strange language may indeed continue to murmur through a generation or two, but dialects, like the lineaments of national character, blend, fade, and are forgotten. Amid this ceaseless influx of foreign material, is also an under-current of domestic emigration;—a change, a fluctuation, a fluttering of the integral parts. This elemental movement and strife, tends ever towards the setting sun. Yet the West recedes from its followers, like the horizon from the pursuing child. Time was, and that within the memory of the living, when to us, the dwellers in New England, the untrodden wilds of Ohio were counted as the extreme West. Now, the stately cities that glitter there, fall short of the central point of the empire. Where, then, is the West? On the banks of the father of waters?—along the pictured rocks of the mighty lake? —at Illinois?—at Iowa?—at Wisconsin?—Scarcely! The searchers for the West, like the gold seekers among the settlers of Virginia, still analyze yellow earth for the invisible and ideal good;—pausing only amid the arid sands of Oregon, or on the sounding shores of the Pacific. New England, the fountain of these internal supplies, still vigorously sustains this drain upon her vitality. The farmer who has many sons,—if the homestead be too narrow, confidently points out to them a place at the West. Thither speed the self-denying missionary, with his Bible, and the persevering teacher with his text-book, laboring to make the wilderness blossom as the rose. Perhaps, thither also may turn the briefless lawyer, to pour his philippics from the stump, and carry the votes of a whole country by his eloquence. The broken merchant there plants himself, changing his ledger for an axe, and making the trees groan, instead of his creditors. Every over-stocked profession finds there a safety-valve. Those who are discontented, and in debt, “make to themselves a captain,” and go forth to a more attractive abode than the cave of Adullam. Lost wealth takes heart and looks up, where are none richer than itself; wasted health fattens and grows strong, with the wild venison, and the toil that takes it. The strong passion of wandering becomes satiated and tame, amidst the boundless prairies; and forfeited reputation, and even flying guilt, fear no reproach amid Texan vales. From the trains of baggage wagons peep forth the faces of young children; and on the canal-boat the careful matron, while her babe sleeps, plies the knitting-needles, ever steering in the wake of the westering sunbeam. Not many years since, where the lofty forests of Ohio, towering in unshorn majesty, cast a solemn shadow over the deep verdure of beautiful and ample vales, a small family of emigrants were seen pursuing their solitary way. They travelled on foot, but not with the aspect of mendicants, though care and suffering were visibly depicted on their countenances. The man walked first, apparently in no kind or compromising mood. The woman carried in her arms an infant, and aided the progress of a feeble boy, who seemed sinking with exhaustion. An eye accustomed to scan the never-resting tide of emigration, might discern, that these pilgrims were inhabitants of the Eastern States, probably retreating from some species of adversity, to one of those imaginary El Dorados, among the shades of the far West, where it is fabled that the evils of mortality have found no place. James Harwood, the leader of that humble group, who claimed from him the charities of husband and of father, halted at the report of a musket, and while he entered a thicket to discover whence it proceeded, the weary and sad-hearted mother sate down upon the grass. Bitter were her reflections during that interval of rest among the wilds of Ohio. The pleasant New England village from which she had just emigrated, and the peaceful home of her birth, rose up to her view, where, but a few years before, she had given her hand to one, whose unkindness now strewed her path with thorns. By constant and endearing attentions, he had won her youthful love, and the two first years of their union promised happiness. Both were industrious and affectionate, and the smiles of their infant in his evening sports, or his slumbers, more than repaid the labors of the day. But a change became visible. The husband grew inattentive to his business, and indifferent to his fireside. He permitted debts to accumulate in spite of the economy of his wife, and became more and more offended at her remonstrances. She strove to hide, even from her own heart, the vice that was gaining the ascendency over him, and redoubled her exertions to render his home agreeable. But too frequently her efforts were of no avail, or contemptuously rejected. The death of her beloved mother, and the birth of a second infant, convinced her, that neither in sorrow nor in sickness, could she expect sympathy from him to whom she had given her heart, in the simple faith of confiding affection. They became miserably poor, and the cause was evident to every observer. In this distress a letter was received from a brother, who had been for several years a resident in Ohio, mentioning that he was induced to remove farther westward, and offering them the use of a tenement which his family would leave vacant, and a small portion of cleared land, until they might be able to become purchasers. Poor Jane listened to this proposal with gratitude. She thought she saw in it the salvation of her husband. She believed that if he were divided from his intemperate companions, he would return to his early habits of industry and virtue. The trial of leaving native and endeared scenes, from which she would once have recoiled, seemed as nothing in comparison with the prospect of his reformation, and returning happiness. Yet, when all their few effects were transmuted into the waggon and horse, which were to convey them to a far land, and the scant and humble necessaries which were to sustain them on their way thither;—when she took leave of brother and sisters, with their households;—when she shook hands with the friends whom she had loved from her cradle, and remembered that it might be for the last time;—and when the hills that encircled her native village, faded into the faint blue outline of the horizon, there came over her such a desolation of spirit, such a foreboding of evil, as she had never before experienced. She blamed herself for these feelings, and repressed their indulgence. The journey was slow and toilsome. The autumnal rains, and the state of the roads were against them. The few utensils and comforts which they carried with them, were gradually abstracted and sold. The object of this traffic could not be doubted:—the effect was but too visible in his conduct. She reasoned,—she endeavored to persuade him to a different course. But anger was the only result. Even when he was not too far stupefied to comprehend her remarks, his deportment was exceedingly overbearing and arbitrary. He felt that she had no friends to protect her from insolence, and was entirely in his own power; while she was compelled to realize that it was a power without generosity, and that there is no tyranny so perfect as that of a capricious and alienated husband. As they approached the close of their distressing journey, the roads became worse, and their horse utterly failed. He had been scantily provided for, as the intemperance of his owner had taxed and impoverished everything, for its own vile indulgence. Jane wept as she looked upon the dying animal, and remembered his faithful and ill-requited services. The unfeeling exclamation with which her husband abandoned him to his fate, fell painfully upon her heart, adding another proof of the extinction of his sensibilities, in the loss of that pitying kindness for the animal creation, which exercises a silent and salutary guardianship over our higher and better sympathies. They were now approaching within a short distance of the termination of their journey, and their directions had been very clear and precise. But his mind became so bewildered, and his heart so perverse, that he persisted in choosing bypaths of underwood and tangled weeds, under the pretence of seeking a shorter route. This increased and prolonged their fatigue, but no entreaty of his wearied wife was regarded. Indeed, so exasperated was he at her expostulations, that she sought safety in silence. The little boy of four years old, whose constitution had been feeble from his infancy, became so feverish and distressed, as to be unable to proceed. The mother, after in vain soliciting aid and compassion from her husband, took him in her arms, while the youngest, whom she had previously carried, and who was unable to walk, clung to her shoulders. Thus burdened, her progress was slow and painful. Still, she was enabled to hold on; for the strength that nerves a mother, toiling for her sick child, is from God. She even endeavored to press on more rapidly than usual, fearing, that if she fell behind, her husband would tear the sufferer from her arms, in some paroxysm of his savage intemperance. Their road during the day, though approaching the small settlement where they were to reside, lay through a solitary part of the country. The children were faint and hungry; and as the exhausted mother rested upon the grass, trying to nurse her infant, she drew from her bosom the last piece of bread, and held it to the parched lips of the feeble child. But he turned away his head, and with a scarcely audible moan, asked for water. Feelingly might she sympathize in the distress of the poor outcast from the tent of Abraham, who laid her perishing son among the shrubs, and sat down a good way off, saying, “Let me not see the death of the child.” But this Christian mother was not in the desert, nor in despair. She looked upward to Him, who is the Refuge of the forsaken, and the Comforter of those whose spirits are cast down. The sun was drawing towards the west, as the voice of James Harwood was heard, issuing from the forest, attended by another man with a gun, and some birds at his girdle. “Wife, will you get up now, and come along? we are not a mile from home. Here is John Williams, who went from our part of the country, and says he is our next-door neighbor.” Jane received his hearty welcome with a thankful spirit, and rose to accompany them. The kind neighbor took the sick boy in his arms, saying,— 8* “Harwood, here, take the baby from your wife. We do not let our women bear all the burdens, in Ohio.” James was ashamed to refuse, and reached his hands towards the child. But accustomed to his neglect, or unkindness, it hid its face, crying, in the maternal bosom. “You see how it is; she makes the children so cross that I never have any comfort of them. She chooses to carry them herself, and always will have her own way in everything.” “You have come to a new-settled country, friends,” said John Williams, “but it is a good country to get a living in. The crops of corn and wheat are such as you never saw in New England. Our cattle live in clover, and the cows give us cream instead of milk. There is plenty of game to employ our leisure, and venison and wild turkey do not come amiss now and then, on a farmer's table. Here is a short cut I can show you, though there is a fence or two to climb. James Harwood, I shall like well to talk with you about old times, and old friends down East. But why don't you help your wife over the fence with her baby?” “So I would, but she is so sulky. She has not spoken a word to me all day. I always say, let such folks take care of themselves, till their mad fit is over.” A cluster of log-cabins now met their view through an opening in the forest. They were pleasantly situated in the midst of an area of cultivated lands. A fine river, surmounted by a rustic bridge, formed of the trunks of trees, cast a sparkling line through the deep, unchanged autumnal verdure. “Here we live,” said their guide, “a hard-working, contented people. That is your house, which has no smoke curling up from the chimney. It may not be quite so genteel as some you have left behind in the old States, but it is about as good as any in the neighborhood. I'll go and call my wife to welcome you. Right glad will she be to see you, for she sets great store by folks from New England.” The inside of a log-cabin, to those not habituated to it, presents but a cheerless aspect. The eye needs time to accustom itself to the rude walls and floors, the absence of glass windows, and doors loosely hung upon leather hinges. The exhausted woman entered, and sank down with her babe. There was no chair to receive her. In the corner of the room stood a rough board table, and a low frame resembling a bedstead. Other furniture there was none. Glad, kind voices of her own sex, recalled her from her stupor. Three or four matrons, and several blooming young faces, welcomed her with smiles. The warmth of reception in a new colony, and the substantial services by which it is manifested, put to shame the ceremonious and heartless professions, which, in a more artificial state of society, are sometimes dignified with the name of friendship. As if by magic, what had seemed almost a prison, assumed a different aspect, under the ministry of active benevolence. A cheerful flame rose from the ample fireplace; several chairs, and a bench for the children appeared; a bed, with comfortable coverings, concealed the shapelessness of the bedstead, and viands to which they had long been strangers, were heaped upon the board. An old lady held the sick boy tenderly in her arms, who seemed to revive, as he saw his mother's face brighten; and the infant, after a draught of fresh milk, fell into a sweet and profound slumber. One by one, the neighbors departed, that the wearied ones might have an opportunity of repose. John Williams, who was the last to bid good-night, lingered a moment ere he closed the door, and said,— “Friend Harwood, here is a fine, gentle cow, feeding at your door; and for old acquaintance sake, you and your family are welcome to the use of her for the present, or until you can make out better.” When they were left alone, Jane poured out her gratitude to her Almighty Protector, in a flood of joyful tears. Kindness, to which she had recently been a stranger, fell as balm of Gilead upon her wounded spirit. “Husband,” she exclaimed in the fulness of her heart, “we may yet be happy.” He answered not, and she perceived that he heard not. He had thrown himself upon the bed, and in a sleep of stupefaction, was dispelling the fumes of inebriety. This new family of emigrants, though in the deepest poverty, were sensible of a degree of satisfaction to which they had long been strangers. The difficulty of procuring ardent spirits in the small and isolated community, promised to be the means of establishing their peace. The mother busied herself in making their humble tenement neat and comfortable, while her husband, as if ambitious to earn in a new residence, the reputation he had forfeited in the old, labored diligently to assist his neighbors in gathering their harvest, receiving in payment such articles as were needed for the subsistence of his household. Jane continually gave thanks in her prayers for this great blessing; and the hope she permitted herself to indulge of his permanent reformation, imparted unwonted cheerfulness to her brow and demeanor. The invalid boy seemed to gather healing from his mother's smiles; for so great was her power over him since sickness had rendered his dependence complete, that his comfort, and even his countenance, were a faithful reflection of her own. Perceiving the degree of her influence, she endeavored to use it, as every religious parent should, for his spiritual benefit. She supplicated that the pencil which was to write upon his soul, might be guided from above. She spoke to him in the tenderest manner of his Father in Heaven, and of His will respecting little children. She pointed out His goodness in the daily gifts that sustain life, in the glorious sun as he came forth rejoicing in the east, in the gently-falling rain, the frail plant, and the dews that nourish it. She reasoned with him of the changes of nature, till he loved even the storm, and the mighty thunder, because they came from God. She repeated to him passages of Scripture with which her memory was stored; and sang hymns until she perceived that, if he was in pain, he complained not, if he might but hear her voice. She made him acquainted with the life of the blessed Redeemer, and how he called young children to his arms, though the disciples forbade them. And it seemed as if a voice from Heaven urged her never to desist from cherishing this tender and deep-rooted piety;—because like the flower of grass he must soon pass away. Yet though it was evident that the seeds of disease were in his system, his health at intervals seemed to be improving; and the little household partook, for a time, the blessings of tranquillity and contentment. But let none flatter himself, that the dominion of vice is suddenly, or easily broken. It may seem to relax its grasp, and to slumber,—but the victim who has long worn its chain, if he would utterly escape, and triumph at last, must do so in the strength of Omnipotence. This, James Harwood never sought. He had begun to experience that prostration of spirits which attends the abstraction of an habitual stimulant. His resolution to recover his lost character, was not proof against this physical inconvenience. He determined at all hazards to gratify his depraved appetite. He laid his plans deliberately, and with the pretext of making some arrangements about the wagon, which had been left broken on the road, departed from his home. His stay was protracted beyond the appointed limit, and at his return, his sin was written on his brow, in characters too strong to be mistaken. That he had also brought with him some hoard of intoxicating liquor, to which to resort, there remained no room to doubt. Day after day, did his shrinking household witness the alternations of causeless anger, and brutal tyranny. To lay waste the comfort of his wife, seemed his paramount object. By constant contradiction and misconstruction, he strove to distress her, and then visited her sensibilities upon her as sins. Had she been obtuse by nature, or indifferent to his welfare, she might with greater ease have borne the cross. But her youth was nurtured in tenderness, and education had refined her susceptibilities, both of pleasure and pain. She could not forget the love he had once manifested for her, nor prevent the chilling contrast from filling her soul with anguish. She could not resign the hope, that the being who had early evinced correct feelings, and noble principles of action, might yet be won back to that virtue which had rendered him worthy of her affections. Still, this hope deferred, was sickness and sorrow to the heart. She found the necessity of deriving consolation, and the power of endurance, wholly from above. The tender invitation by the mouth of a prophet, was balm to her wounded soul,—“As a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and as a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, have I called thee, saith thy God.” So faithful was she in the discharge of the difficult duties that devolved upon her,—so careful not to irritate her husband, by reproach or gloom,—that to a casual observer, she might have appeared to be confirming the doctrine of the ancient philosopher, that happiness is in exact proportion to virtue. Had he asserted, that virtue is the source of all that happiness which depends upon ourselves, none could have controverted his position. But to a woman,—a wife,—a mother, how small is the portion of independent happiness! She has woven the tendrils of her soul around many props. Each revolving year renders their support more necessary. They cannot waver, or warp, or break, but she must tremble and bleed. There was one modification of her husband's persecutions, which the fullest measure of her piety could not enable her to bear unmoved. This was unkindness to her feeble and suffering boy. It was at first commenced as the surest mode of distressing her. It opened a direct avenue to her lacerated heart-strings. What began in perverseness, seemed to end in hatred, as evil habits often create perverted principles. The wasted and wild-eyed invalid, shrank from his father's glance and footstep, as from the approach of a foe. More than once had he taken him from the little bed, which maternal care had provided for him, and forced him to go forth in the cold of the winter storm. “I mean to harden him,” said he. “All the neighbors know that you make such a fool of him, that he will never be able to get a living. For my part, I wish I had never been called to the trial of supporting a useless boy, who pretends to be sick, only that he may be coaxed by a silly mother.” On such occasions, it was in vain that the mother attempted to protect the child. She might neither shelter him in her bosom, nor control the frantic violence of the father. Harshness and the agitation of fear, deepened a disease which might else have yielded. The timid boy, in terror of his natural protector, withered away like a blighted flower. It was of no avail that friends remonstrated with the unfeeling parent, or that hoary-headed men warned him solemnly of his sins. Intemperance had destroyed his respect for man, and his fear of God. Spring, at length, emerged from the shades of that heavy and bitter winter. But its smile brought no gladness to the declining child. Consumption fed upon his vitals, and his nights were restless, and full of pain. “Mother, I wish I could smell the violets that grew upon the green bank by our dear old home.” “It is too early for violets, my child. But the grass is beautifully green around us, and the birds sing sweetly, as if their hearts were full of praise.” “In my dreams last night, I saw the clear waters of the brook, that ran by the bottom of my little garden. I wish I could taste them once more. And I heard such music too, as used to come from that white church among the trees, where every Sunday, the happy people meet to worship God.” The mother knew that the hectic fever had been long increasing, and now detected such an unearthly brightness in his eye, that she feared his intellect wandered. She seated herself on his low bed, and bent over him. He lay silent for some time. “Do you think my father will come?” Dreading the agonizing agitation, which in his paroxysms of coughing and pain, he evinced at the sound of his father's well-known step, she answered,— “I think not, love. You had better try to sleep.” “Mother I wish he would come. I do not feel afraid now. Perhaps he would let me lay my cheek to his once more, as he used to do when I was a babe in my grandmother's arms. I should be glad to say goodby to him, before I go to my Saviour.” Gazing intently in his face, she saw the work of the destroyer in lines too plain to be mistaken. “My son, my dear son,—say, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” “Mother,” he replied, with a smile upon his ghastly features, “He is ready. I desire to go to Him. Hold the baby to me, that I may kiss her. That is all. Now sing to me,—and oh! wrap me closer in your arms, for I shiver with cold.” He clung, with a death grasp, to that bosom which had long been his sole earthly refuge. “Sing louder, dear mother, a little louder. I cannot hear you.” A tremulous tone, as of a broken harp, rose above her grief to comfort the dying child. One sigh of icy breath was upon her cheek as she joined it to his,—one shudder, and all was over. She held the body long in her arms, as if fondly hoping to warm and revivify it with her breath. Then she stretched it upon its bed, and kneeling beside it, hid her face in that grief, which none but mothers feel. It was a deep and sacred solitude, alone with the dead,—nothing save the soft breathing of the sleeping babe, fell upon that solemn pause. Then, the silence was broken by a wail of piercing sorrow. It ceased, and a voice arose,—a voice of supplication for strength to endure, as “seeing Him who is invisible.” Faith closed what was begun in weakness. It became a prayer of thanksgiving to Him, who had released the dove-like spirit from its prison-house of pain, that it might taste the peace, and mingle in the melody, of heaven. She arose from the orison, and bent calmly over her dead. The thin, placid features wore a smile, as when he had spoken of Jesus. She composed the shining locks around the pure forehead, and gazed long, on what was to her beautiful. Tears had vanished from her eyes, and in their stead was an expression almost sublime, as of one who had given an angel back to God. The father entered carelessly. She pointed to the pale, immovable brow. “See! he suffers no longer.” He drew near, and looked on the dead with surprise and sadness. A few natural tears forced their way, and fell on the face of the first-born, who was once his pride. The memories of that moment were bitter. He spoke tenderly to the emaciated mother, and she, who a short time before was raised above the sway of grief, wept like an infant, as those few affectionate tones touched the sealed fountains of other years. Neighbors and friends visited them, desirous to console their sorrow, and attended them when they committed the body to the earth. There was a shady and secluded spot, which they had consecrated by the burial of their few dead. Thither that whole little colony were gathered, and seated on the fresh-springing grass, listened to the holy, healing words of the inspired volume. It was read by the oldest man in the colony, who had himself often mourned. As he bent reverently over the sacred page, there was that on his brow which seemed to say, “This hath been my comfort in my affliction.” Silver hairs thinly covered his temples, and his low voice was modulated by feeling, as he read of the frailty of man, withering like the flower of grass before it groweth up; and of His majesty, in whose sight “a thousand years are as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.” He selected from the words of that compassionate One, who “gathereth the lambs with His arm, and carrieth them in His bosom;” who, pointing out as an example the humility of little children, said, “except ye become as one of these, ye cannot enter the kingdom of heaven,” and who calleth all the “weary and heavy-laden to come unto Him, that He may give them rest.” The scene called forth sympathy, even from manly bosoms. The mother, worn with watching and weariness, bowed her head down to the clay that concealed her child. And it was observed with gratitude by that friendly group, that the husband supported her with his arm, and mingled his tears with hers. He returned from this funeral in much mental distress. His sins were brought to remembrance, and reflection was misery. For many nights, sleep was disturbed by visions of his neglected boy. Sometimes he imagined that he heard him coughing from his low bed, and felt constrained to go to him, in a strange disposition of kindness, but his limbs were unable to obey the dictates of his will. Then he would see him pointing with a thin, dead hand, to the dark grave, or beckoning him to follow to the unseen world. Conscience haunted him with terror, and many prayers from pious hearts arose, that he might now be led to repentance. The venerable man who had read the Bible at the burial of his boy, counselled and entreated him with the earnestness of a father, to yield to the warning voice from above, and to “break off his sins by righteousness, and his iniquities by turning unto the Lord.” There was a change in his habits and conversation, and his friends trusted it would be permanent. She, who above all others was interested in the result, spared no exertion to win him back to the way of virtue, and to soothe his heart into peace with itself, and obedience to his Maker. Yet was she doomed to witness the full force of grief, and of remorse, upon intemperance, only to see them utterly overthrown at last. The reviving goodness with whose indications she had solaced herself, and even given thanks that her beloved son had not died in vain, was transient as the morning dew. Habits of industry which had begun to spring up, proved rootless. The dead, and his cruelty to the dead, were alike forgotten. Disaffection to the chastened being, who, against hope, still hoped for his salvation, resumed its dominion. The friends who had alternately reproved and encouraged him, were convinced that their efforts had been of no avail. Intemperance, “like the strong man armed,” took possession of a soul, that lifted no cry for aid to the Holy Spirit, and girded on no weapon to resist the destroyer. Summer passed away, and the anniversary of their arrival at the colony returned. It was to Jane Harwood a period of sad and solemn retrospection. The joys of early days, and the sorrows of maturity passed in review before her, and while she wept, she questioned her heart, what had been its gain from a Father's discipline, or whether it had sustained that greatest of all losses,—the loss of its afflictions. She was alone at this season of self-communion. The absences of her husband had become more frequent and protracted. A storm, which feelingly reminded her of those which had often beat upon them, when homeless and weary travellers, had been raging for nearly two days. To this cause she imputed the unusually long stay of her husband. Through the third night of his absence, she lay sleepless, listening for his steps. Sometimes she fancied she heard shouts of laughter, for the moods in which he returned from his revels, was various:—but it was only the shriek of the tempest. Then she trembled, as if some ebullition of his frenzied anger rang in her ears. It was the roar of the hoarse wind through the forest. All night long she listened to these sounds, and hushed and sang to her affrighted babe. Unrefreshed, she arose, and resumed her morning labors. Suddenly, her eye was attracted by a group of neighbors, coming up slowly from the river. A dark and terrible foreboding oppressed her. She hastened out to meet them. Coming towards her house was a female friend agitated and tearful, who, passing her arm around her, would have spoken. “Oh! you come to bring me evil tidings! I pray you, let me know the worst.” The object was indeed to prepare her mind for a fearful calamity. The body of her husband had been found, drowned, as was supposed, during the darkness of the preceding night, in attempting to cross the bridge of logs, which had been partially broken by the swollen waters. Utter prostration of spirit came over the desolate mourner. Her energies were broken, and her heart withered. She had sustained the privations of poverty and emigration,—the burdens of unceasing, unrequited care, without a murmur. She had laid her first-born in the grave with resignation, for Faith had heard the Redeemer's blessed invitation, “Suffer the little child to come unto me.” She had seen him in whom her heart's young affections were garnered up, become a “persecutor and injurious,”—a prey to vice the most disgusting and destructive. Yet she had borne up under all. One hope remained with her as an “anchor of the soul,” the hope that he might yet repent, and be reclaimed. She had persevered in her complicated and self-denying duties, with that charity which “beareth all things,—believeth all things,— endureth all things.” But now, he had died in his sin. The deadly leprosy which had stolen over his heart, could no more be “purged by sacrifice or offering forever.” She knew not, that a single prayer for mercy, had preceded the soul on its passage to the bar of the High Judge. There were bitter dregs in this cup of grief, which she had never before wrung out. Again the sad-hearted community assembled in their humble cemetery. A funeral in an infant colony touches sympathies of an almost exclusive character. It is as if a large family suffered. One is smitten down, whom every eye knew, every voice saluted. To bear along the corpse of the strong man through the fields which he had sown, and to cover motionless in the grave, that arm which it was expected would reap the ripened harvest; awakens a thrill, deep and startling, in the breasts of those who wrought by his side, during “the burden and heat of the day.” To lay the mother on her pillow of clay, whose last struggle with life, was perchance to resign the hope of one more brief visit to the land of her fathers,—whose heart's last pulsation might have been a prayer, that her children should return, and grow up within the shadow of the school-house, and the church of God, is a grief in which none save emigrants may participate. To consign to their narrow, noteless abode, both young and old,—the infant, and him of hoary hairs, without the solemn knell, the sable train, the hallowed voice of the man of God, giving back in the name of his fellow-Christians, the most precious roses of their pilgrim path, and speaking with divine authority of Him, who is the “resurrection and the life,” adds desolation to that weeping, with which man goeth down to his dust. 9 But with heaviness of an unspoken and peculiar nature, was this victim of vice borne from the home that he had troubled, and laid by the side of that meek child, to whose tender years, he had been an unnatural enemy. There was sorrow among all who stood around his grave,—and it bore features of that sorrow which is without hope. The widowed mourner was not able to raise her head from the bed, when the bloated remains of her unfortunate husband were committed to the dust. Long and severe sickness ensued, and in her convalescence, a letter was received from her brother, inviting her and her child to an asylum under his roof, and appointing a period to come and conduct them on their homeward journey. With her little daughter, the sole remnant of her wrecked heart's wealth, she returned to her kindred. It was with emotions of deep and painful gratitude, that she bade farewell to the inhabitants of that infant settlement, whose kindness, through all her adversities, had never failed. And when they remembered her example of uniform patience and piety, and the saint-like manner in which she had sustained her burdens, and cherished their sympathies, they felt as though a tutelary spirit had departed from among them. In the home of her brother, she educated her daughter to industry, and that contentment, which virtue teaches. Restored to those friends with whom the morning of life had passed, she shared with humble cheerfulness the comforts that earth had yet in store for her; but in the cherished sadness of her perpetual widowhood, in the bursting sighs of her nightly orison, might be traced a sacred, deep-rooted sorrow,—the memory of her erring husband and the miseries of unreclaimed intemperance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE WEEPING WIFE. I see a weeping wife,— What grieves her to the heart? Has Death amid her treasured joys Launched forth a fatal dart? No!—'Tis a living woe That makes her eye so red,— The father of her children bears The plague-spot on his head. There's cursing on his tongue,— There's madness in his brain;— He yieldeth to a demon's will, And darkly clanks his chain. Haste!—stir his blinded soul With kindly words and strong,— And snatch him from the yawning pit To which he reels along. Nor let your pitying cares, Your earnest labors cease, Till clothed, and in his own right mind, He dwells in love and peace. So, from the heart and home, Once desolate and drear, Your names, shall on the household prayer Go up, with grateful tear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MOURNFUL VISIT. I Turned me toward a cottage, round whose porch Climbed the gay woodbine, and whose quiet roof Seemed through its leafy canopy to smile A welcome to the guest. My heart was light As near this rural haunt I drew, to greet An early friend, with whom the joyous sport Mid neighboring schoolmates,—all our lessons done, Had oft been shared. Beside the open door Two cherub-children gambol'd. One displayed In vivid miniature, the father's face,— Such as in memory's casket still it dwelt,— The high, bold forehead, and full, hazel eye, Gentle, yet ardent. On, with winning smile He led his fairy sister, murmuring low In varied tones of playful tenderness,— Or sometimes bending o'er her fragile form In mimic guardianship, with such a grace, That to my heart I pressed him, as I said, “Show me thy father.” To a couch he led, Where lay a man. I could not call him friend,— So chang'd! Had sickness marr'd the noble brow, Once wont to beam with intellectual light, And glow with glad benevolence? Ah, no!— For then I might have poured a soothing balm Of sympathy, and raised the sufferer's heart To God, the Healer.—But I knew too well The coloring of the seal that Vice had stamped On form and feature. And she, too, was there, Who at the altar gave her hallowed vow, In all the trusting confidence of love, To this, her chosen one. On her young cheek There was a cankering grief, and the pale trace Of beauty's rose-bud blighted. When I spake, Recalling memories of our early days,— Where in the paths of science and of peace We trod with many a friend, his bloated lips Swelled out with stupid laughter, and such words As flippant folly utters. At the voice Of those young creatures playing near his bed, His fiery eyeballs flashed, and brutal threats Appalled their innocent hearts,—till that fair girl From whom intemperance thus had reft the guide That Nature gave, in terror, hid her face Deep in her mother's robe. I would have spoke In bitter blame of that most poisonous cup, And of the vice that seared a noble soul,— But that I saw within the sunken eye Of that long-suffering wife, the pleading tear Of silent, fond forbearance. So all thought Of sternness, breathed itself away in sighs.— But as I went my way, I mourned the lot Of that sad widowhood, and orphanage, That hath nor hope nor pity. Sad, I roamed Along the grassy vale, and when no eye Beheld me, gave free passage to the tear And prayer of bitter anguish. Oh, my God! Without whose aid the proudest strength of man, And fairest promise, are but broken reeds,— So shield us from temptation, and from sin Deliver us,—that we unscathed may rise Our earthly trials o'er, where Virtue dwells Fast by her Sire, and tastes a deathless joy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOR A JUVENILE TEMPERANCE SOCIETY. Old History tells of many a land That bent beneath Oppression's yoke, Till, with firm heart and fearless hand, The fetter and the sway were broke. But we a sterner toil essay,— We struggle with a tyrant foe, Whose poisoned arrows pierce the soul, And lay uncounted thousands low. The warrior's bleeding breast may close, Though wounded by the keenest steel, But he, who feels that direr fang, What art can soothe? what balsam heal? Yet courage! onward! He whose grace Hath been the endanger'd hero's shield, Can bless the stripling's sling and stone, And make the mail-clad giant yield. So, when by this dread yoke enslaved No more our native realm shall be, How high will swell the tuneful strain Of Freedom's noblest jubilee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">9* LOST HOPES. “This child, so lovely and so cherub-like, Say, must he know remorse? must passion come, Passion in all, or any of its shapes To cloud and sully what is now so pure?” Rogers. The deep love that settles on an only child, is peculiar, and may be perilous. Spread over a wider surface, it respires freely, and inhales health; but, thus concentrated, becomes absorbing,—perhaps morbid, or idolatrous. If the faults of its object pierce through the folds and mazes of blinding partiality, they cause paternal affection unutterable anguish. But more frequently they are perceived in part, or not at all. The desire that others should be equally blinded, or inspired with a similar admiration, sometimes becomes a demand, and ends in disappointment. Dread of losing its sole treasure, magnifies the slightest exposure, and sees in trivial indispositions the symptoms of fatal disease. How touchingly is the utter desolation of such affectionate hope depicted in the epitaph upon an only daughter, in Ashbourne Church, England, whose little effigy upon its marble mattress, mingling the restlessness of pain, with the meek smile of patience, has drawn tears from many a traveller. “We trusted our all to this frail bark:— And the wreck was total. I was not in safety; neither had I rest; neither was I quiet: Yet this trouble came.” Still, to the excess or perversion of this heaven-implanted affection, there are beautiful exceptions, reflecting honor both on the self-denial of the parent, and the well-balanced nature of the child. Gentle, shrinking spirits there are, needing to be soothed and fortified by an unwavering, exclusive tenderness:—grateful, generous ones also, that do not abuse it. The indulgence that hardens others into selfishness, renders them more amiable, and disposed to show the same kindness with which they have themselves been nurtured. The deprivation of fraternal and sisterly intercourse, often creates in the earlier periods of life a loneliness, which, acting like a perpetual discipline, leads to humility and piety. So that the position of an only child,—in itself a severe ordeal,—may either ripen superior excellence, or stifle its indications in selfishness, disappointment, and sorrow. In a small and neatly-furnished parlor, might be seen a group of three persons,—the central one being a child, who occupied the hazardous situation which we have contemplated. Through his thick curls, the mother's fingers often moved with delight, arranging them in the most becoming attitudes around the neck, or the well-formed forehead. The father, though what is called a matter-of-fact man, found a new and growing affection mingling with the cares of the day, and was never better pleased at returning from his business at night, than to be entertained with the smart sayings of his boy, which were treasured up for that purpose. Still, these parents were more judicious in the training of their child than many in similar situations, and though very indulgent, it would appear that this indulgence had not been especially injurious. Frank Edwards was affectionate, and not disposed to take an undue advantage of kindness. He was cheerful in his attendance at school, and regular in returning home, where something to give him pleasure was sedulously prepared. He was generally satisfied to do what his parents desired, and this good conduct gave to his naturally handsome features, an agreeable expression; so that the neighbors remarked they had seldom seen an only child so obedient, and with such good manners. Among those who took a deep interest in the boy, was an unmarried uncle, from whom he was named. As he resided near, scarcely an evening passed without a visit from him. He interested himself in all that concerned Frank, and the most expensive gifts at birth-days, and New-Year, were always from his uncle. On holiday afternoons, when the weather was favorable, his uncle usually came, with his fine pair of ponies, on which they took equestrian exercise together. Such was his absorbing interest in his namesake, that the parents informed him of all their movements respecting him, and observed that he was always pleased to give advice respecting his education. One of his favorite propositions was, that he should be sent away from home. This, the parents steadily resisted; arguing, that their own schools bore so high a reputation, that many children from distant towns were sent to be recipients of their privileges. “All this may be very true,” he replied; “and yet he ought to go from home, to make him manly. He is brought up too much like a girl. Here, I see him putting his arm around his mother's neck, or sitting with his hand in hers, perfectly childish, you know. How can be ever be fit to bear his part among men, cossetted up in this way?” These opinions being communicated to Frank, made him constrained in the presence of his uncle. He learned to repress the expression of his affectionate feelings, from fear of ridicule; and lest he should not be considered manly, by one whose good opinion he valued. “My dear,” said Mr. Edwards, one evening, “my brother has made a distinct proposal, that Frank should be sent to a celebrated scholastic institution in a distant city, for two years, before he enters college; all the expenses of which he engages to defray.” “I pray you not to listen to him. Our boy is doing well here. We cannot tell how it will be with him, when he is far away,—perhaps exposed to bad example.” “I think as you do, with regard to that. Besides, I should be lost without him, when I come from the store, in the evening. But brother gives me no peace. If we do not cross him in this matter, he will be very likely to make Frank his heir. You know he is rich, and my possessions are very moderate. I think we ought to make a sacrifice of our feelings, for the sake of his future good.” “There are other kinds of good, besides the gain of money, that I covet for our child,” said the mother, her eyes filling with tears; “and losses, for which all the wealth in the world cannot pay.” But she was not slow in perceiving that her husband had already consented to this arrangement,—and the brother entering soon after, confirmed it. She felt that longer opposition was fruitless, yet was still moved to say, with an unwonted warmth and emphasis,— “My heart is full of misgivings. While my son is by this fireside, I know that he is not in bad company. When he is removed from my sight and influence, how can I know this? I have reason to think that he does not neglect his studies, and he is always happy with me.” “That is the trouble, sister; you make him altogether too happy. Remember, he is an only child,—everybody can see that. He has got to live in the world, as well as the rest of us. Yet what does he know of the world? Your husband is much away, occupied with his business, and it is almost a proverb, that boys brought up by women, are good for nothing.” “Brother, if he is an only child, I think he has not been indulged to his hurt. Is not his home a safe one? Is not his school a good one? Is he not making respectable progress? Is he not in good habits? Can you give assurance that a change will not be for the worse? Do you know certainly, that his principles will be strong to resist evil?” The mother argued in vain. She was alternately argued with and soothed. All her objections were resolved into natural reluctance to resign the solace of her son's company; and as the father had consented, she was enforced to consent also. Frank had arrived at an age when the desire of seeing new places, and making new acquaintances, was alluring. So he did not heighten the pain of his mother, by any unwillingness to depart. In the preparations for his wardrobe, and supply of books, which were on an unusually liberal scale, he took much interest, and could not avoid boasting a little to his old companions of his brilliant prospects. But when the last trunk was locked, his spirits quailed. Seated between his father and mother, and expecting every moment the arrival of the stage-coach, the tears rushed so fast to his eyes, and he felt such a suffocating sensation in his throat, that he could scarcely heed their parting counsel. At the sound of the wheels, stopping at the door, he would fain have thrown himself upon his mother's neck and wept. But his uncle, who was to accompany him, leaped from the vehicle, and came in. So he busied himself in arranging his parcels, and after shaking hands courageously with his parents, said, as he rushed from the house,— “Good by!—good by!—You shall hear from me, as soon as I get there.” He dared not look back, until the roof of his home, and the trees that shaded it, were entirely out of sight. For he knew that if he trusted himself with another glimpse, he should burst into tears,—and feared that his uncle would shame him by the appellation of “Miss Fanny,” before strangers. In the large school that he entered, everything seemed new and strange. He found more trials of temper, and privations of comfort, than he had anticipated. He went with an intention to make himself distinguished by scholarship. But there were many older and more advanced than himself, and he did not exhibit the perseverance necessary, in such circumstances, to insure success. He also suffered from that sinking loneliness of heart, which an indulged child feels, when first exiled from the sympathies of home. In the headaches, to which, from childhood, he had been occasionally subject, he sadly missed maternal nursing and tenderness. But he would not acknowledge home-sickness, or complain of indisposition, lest it should not be manly; and having a good temper, became gradually a favorite with his new associates. Everything went on well, until his room-mate was changed, and a careless, immoral boy, placed in this intimate connection. At length, it was proved that he had not the moral courage to say no, when tempted to evil,—and a sad change in his deportment became evident. He had not firmness enough to reprove his companion for what he knew to be wicked,—or steadfastly to resist what his conscience disapproved. It was not long ere he began to waste his time, and neglect the appointed lessons. Fortified by bad example, he scorned the censure that followed, and learned to ridicule, in secret, the instructors whom he should have loved. Foolish and hurtful books, engrossed and corrupted the minds of those thoughtless comrades,—and there they were, making themselves merry with what they should have shunned, while their distant relatives supposed them diligent in the acquisition of knowledge. Months passed on, and the vacation approached. Every day was counted by the anxious mother. His room was put in perfect order, and some articles of furniture added, which it was thought would please him. His little library was arranged to make the best appearance, and his minerals newly labelled, and placed in their respective compartments. Some of his toys she removed to her own cabinet, for she said, “They will be too childish for him now;—but I love to keep them, for they remind me of him, when he just began to walk and to speak, and was always so happy.” His favorite articles of food were not forgotten, and as the time of his arrival drew near, she busied herself in their preparation, with that delight in which only the fond maternal heart can partake. When the loved one came, his uncle exclaimed with exultation, “How improved!—how manly!” He had, indeed, gained much in stature, and promised to possess a graceful, well-proportioned form. But those who scrutinized his countenance and manner, might be led to doubt whether every change had been for the better, or whether the added manliness might not have been purchased at too great a cost. Simple gratifications no longer contented him. He seemed to require for himself a lavish expenditure. He ceased to ask pleasantly for the things that he desired, or to express gratitude for them; but said churlishly through his shut teeth, with half-averted face,— “I want this, or that. Other boys have all they wish. I see no reason why I should not.” His mother was still more alarmed at the habits of reserve and concealment which he had contracted. Formerly, he was accustomed to impart freely to her, all that concerned him. Now, she could not but feel that she was shut out from his confidence, and fear that her influence over him was irrecoverably lost. Still, she remitted no effort or device, in which the maternal heart is so fruitful, to reinstate herself in his affections. Sometimes, she was flattered by a brightening hope; then he started aside, like a deceitful bow. His first vacation was, in these respects, a model of those that followed;—and the two last years at school passed away, with little intellectual gain, and great moral loss. At his entrance into college he was exposed to greater temptations, and still less inclined to repel them. Let no parent flatter himself, that it will be well with a son thus situated, unless he possesses firm principles, and is willing diligently to labor in the acquisition of knowledge. Good talents, and good temper alone, will not save him. The first, without industry, are unfruitful; and the sunshine of the latter may be clouded by immediate self-reproach. We will not follow Frank Edwards, through the haunts of folly and intemperance where his ruin was consummated. His letters to his affectionate parents were few, and brief. Those to his uncle were more frequent, because on him the supply of his purse depended. That gentleman was heard to say, with a smile of somewhat indefinite character, that “truly, he spent money like a man.” It was supposed, however, that in the course of a year or two, he might have become dissatisfied with the manly expenses of his nephew, as he ceased to boast of this proof of his virility. Though Frank was ignobly contented with the lowest grade in scholarship, he had still a latent ambition to be distinguished in some way or other. So he was fond of speaking of his “rich, old-bachelor uncle,” and saying that, without doubt, he should be his heir. His mad expenditure was praised as liberality; and he called a fine, noble-hearted fellow, by the gay companions who walked with him in the way to destruction. Early in the third year of his collegiate course, he came home in ill health. He found fault with the laws of the Institution, and ridiculed its officers. He said it was impossible to gain a good education there, if one applied himself ever so closely to his studies. In short, he blamed every person, but himself. He had left college in disgrace, and debt, with neither the disposition or ability to return. His uncle, who had certainly great reason to be offended, told him that he need have no further expectations from him; for unless the whole course of his life was changed, he should choose some more worthy recipient of his bounty, and find some heir to his estate, who would not dishonor his name. The sad, and mortified father, took the youth to his own counting-house. He enforced on him the necessity of doing something for his support. But he had no habits of application, and despised the routine of business, and the confinement that it imposed. His red, and bloated face revealed, but too truly, the vice to which he was enslaved. As he passed in the street, he was pointed out, as the ruined young man. Alas! for the poor mother. Long did she labor to hide the fearful truth from her own heart. Her love, ingenious in its excuses, strove to palliate his conduct in the view of others, hoping that he might yet retrieve his reputation. Patiently, and with woman's tact, she waited for glimpses of good feeling,—for moments of reflection, to give force to her tender appeals,—her earnest remonstrances. But her husband said to her,— “It is in vain that we would blind ourselves to what is known to all the people. Our son is a sot! I have tried with, and for him, every means of reformation. But they are all like water spilt upon the ground, which no man gathereth up again.” That disgusting vice which breaks down grace of form, and beauty of countenance, and debases intellect to a level with the brute creation, has seldom been more painfully displayed than in the case of this miserable youth. The pleasant chamber, so carefully decorated by maternal taste,—the very pictures on whose walls seemed to look reproachfully at him,—where his happy boyhood had dreamed away nights of innocence, and woke to the exuberance of health and joy,—was now the scene of his frequent sickness, senseless laughter, or awful imprecations. But his career was short, and his sudden death horrible. Those who most loved him, were unable to witness it With eyeballs starting from their sockets, he raved of hideous monsters, and fiery shapes, that surrounded him. One furious struggle,—one unearthly shriek of wild and weak contention,—and in the agonies of delirium tremens, died this miserable victim of intemperance, ere time had impaired his vigor, or ripened the blossom of his manly prime. In the suburbs of the city where Frank Edwards was born and died, was a cluster of humble dwellings, in one of which resided a widow, with her only son. She was poor, and inured to labor, but freely expended on him, the little gains of her industry, as well as the overflowing fulness of her affections. She denied herself every superfluity, that he might enjoy the advantages of education, and the indulgences that boyhood covets. Silently she sate, working at her small fire, by a single lamp, often regarding with intense delight her boy, as he amused himself with his books, or sought out his lessons for the following day. The expenses of his education were defrayed by her unresting toil, and glad and proud was she to bestow on him privileges which she had never been so happy as to share. She believed him to be faithfully acquiring that knowledge which she respected, without being able fully to comprehend. But his teachers, and his idle playmates, better knew how he was employed. He learned to astonish his simple admiring parent with high-sounding epithets, and technical terms, and to despise her for not understanding them. When she saw him sometimes dejected, at comparing his situation with those who were above him in rank, she deepened her own self-denial, that she might add a luxury to his table, or a garment to his wardrobe. How happy was her affectionate heart in such sacrifices. Yet she erred in judgment, for they fell like good seed upon stony ground. Indulgence ministered to his selfishness, and rendered him incapable of warm gratitude, or just appreciation. As his boyhood advanced, there was little reciprocity of kindness, and every year seemed to diminish even that little. At length, his manners assumed a cast of defiance. She was grieved at the alteration, but solaced herself with the sentiment, that it “was just the nature of boys.” He grew boisterous and disobedient. His returns to their humble cottage, became irregular. She sate up late for him, and when she heard his approaching footsteps, forgot her weariness, and welcomed him kindly. But he might have seen reproach written on the paleness of her loving brow, if he would have read its language. During those long and lonely evenings, she sometimes wept as she remembered him in his early years, when he was so gentle, and to her eye, so beautiful. “But this is the nature of young men,” said her lame philosophy. So she armed herself to bear. At length, it was evident that darker vices were making him their victim. The habit of intemperance could no longer be concealed, even from a love that blinded itself. The widowed mother remonstrated with unwonted energy. She was answered in the dialect of insolence and brutality. He disappeared from her cottage. What she dreaded, had come upon her. In his anger, he had gone to sea. And now, every night when the tempest howled, and the wind was high, she lay sleepless, thinking of him. She saw him in her imagination climbing the slippery shrouds, or doing the bidding of rough, unfeeling men. Again, she fancied that he was sick and suffering, with none to watch over him, and have patience with his waywardness; and her head, which silver hairs had begun to sprinkle, throbbed in agony, till her eyes gushed out like fountains of waters. But hopes of his return began to cheer her. When the new moon, with its slender crescent looked in at her window, she said in her lonely heart, “My boy will be here, before that moon is old.” And when it waned, and went away, she sighed, “My boy will remember me.” Years fled, and there was no letter,—no message. Sometimes, she gathered floating tidings that he was on some far sea, or in some foreign clime. When he touched at any port of his native land, it was not to seek the cottage of his mother, but to waste his wages in revelry, and re-embark on a new voyage. Weary years, and no recognition, no letter.—And yet she had abridged her comforts that he might be taught to write, and was wont to exhibit his penmanship with such pride. Alas! her indulgence had been lost on an ignoble nature. But she checked the reproachful thought and sighed,—“It was the way with sailors.” Amid all these years of neglect and cruelty, still Love lived on. When Hope withheld nutriment, it begged food of Memory. It was satisfied with the crumbs from a table, that must never be spread more. So Memory brought the fragments that she had gathered into her basket, when infancy and childish innocence held their simple festivals, and Love as a mendicant received that broken bread, and fed upon it, and gave thanks. It fed upon the cradle-smile, upon the first lisping words, when with its cheek laid upon the mother's, the babe slumbered the live-long night, or when essaying the first uncertain footsteps, he tottered with outstretched arms to her bosom, as a bird newly-fledged, to its nest. But Religion found this forsaken widow, and communed with her at the deep midnight, while the storm was raging without. It told her of a “name better than of sons or of daughters,” and she was comforted. It bade her resign herself to the will of her Father in Heaven, and she found peace. It was a cold evening in the winter, and the snow lay deep upon the earth. The widow sate alone, by her little fireside. The marks of early age had settled upon her. 10 There was meekness on her brow, and in her hand, a book from whence that meekness came. A heavy knock shook her door, and ere she could open it, a man entered. He moved with pain, like one crippled, and his red and downcast visage, was partially concealed by a torn hat. Among those who had been familiar with his youthful countenance, only one, save the Being who made him, could have recognized him through his disguise and misery. The mother, looking deep into his eye, saw a faint tinge of that fair blue, which had charmed her, when it unclosed from the cradle-dream. “My son! My son!” Had the prodigal returned, by a late repentance, to atone for years of ingratitude and sin? I will not speak of the revels that shook the lowly roof of his widowed parent, or the profanity that disturbed her repose. The remainder of his history is brief. The effects of vice had debilitated his constitution, and once, as he was apparently recovering from a long paroxysm of intemperance, apoplexy struck his heated brain, and he lay,— a bloated and hideous corse! The poor mother faded away, and followed him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A DREAM. In troubled sleep, I seem'd to see a flood Flaming and fearful. Far and wide it spread, And many trifled on its fatal brink Who never more unscath'd, to life return'd: For he who reel'd upon its slippery verge, Did plunge therein and mock his God, and die. Loud, warning voices call'd the endanger'd back, And bade them drink pure water, and be whole. Yet some there were, who strove with eager toil To form new channels for that baleful tide, With ætna's lava,—and they strangelypress'd The fire-cup to their weaker neighbor's lip, Till the red plague-spot rankled in his soul, While in their coffers swell'd the price of blood. Again I looked:—And lo! they did the deeds That bounty prompts,—the sacred fane they rear'd For Christian worship, and the Gospel-gift Sent to blind Pagans; holding high their lamp, That, like a city set upon a hill, Its light might not be hid. Yet still they sold Such poison to their brother, as bereav'd His wretched wife, and on his babes entail'd Dire orphanage! Then fled my dream away; And words were trembling on my lip to Him Who giveth skill to read His Holy Word,— That He would grant us hearts to understand That wealth, obtain'd without His fear, is but An ill inheritance.— Oh! break the chain Of Mammon from our spirits, that in love To all mankind, as well as love to Thee, With hands outstretch'd to pluck our brother's feet From the destroyer's net, we so may pass This evil world, as mid all snares to hold Our footing firm in Thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE VOICE OF THE COUNTRY. I heard a bitter sigh Break from a mother's breast, And knew it was my Country's voice That thus her sons addrest:— “Ye are my crown of hope, Dim not its peerless ray; Ye are the sinews of my strength,— Cast not that strength away. “There is a fiery cup, Whose ministry of woe Can melt the spirit's purest pearl, And lay the mightiest low: Turn from its treacherous tide, Repel its siren claim, Nor let me mid the nations blush, And mourn my children's shame. “And will ye, for the sake Of one brief poison-draught, The record of my fame debase, By blood and suffering bought?— And will ye cast a stain Upon my banner's ray, That all the rivers of your realm Can never wash away?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FALLEN BY THE WAY. From the parent's fond protection, From his pleasant native glen, Youth, with reckless spirit hasteth To the crowded haunts of men: Hidden snares and tempters meet him, Lo! he falleth by the way: Kneel and raise him,—kneel and raise him, He hath fallen by the way. Full of pride, and self-reliance, With a warrior's haughty eye, Dauntless, to the world's encounter, Manhood in his strength went by: Foes in ambush gather'd round him, He hath fallen by the way: Kneel and warn him,—kneel and aid him, He hath fallen by the way. Heavenly Father! Thou who knowest All the weakness of the breast, All the sorrow of the lowest, All the frailties of the best,— Teach us, for our erring brethren, With a humbled soul to pray; Deign to help them,—deign to save them, They have fallen by the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE GOOD QUEEN. “I do assert, from all excess In food,—strong drink, or gaudy dress, To every man doth come Disturbance in his inward mind, Imprudence, vengeance, anger blind, And sorrows fierce, and ills that bind In dark, and fearful doom.” King Alfred. A summer moonlight lay on the sleeping Seine. It touched with trembling lustre the thick, waving trees, and promiscuous roofs of Paris, as it was, thirteen centuries since. The elegance and beauty that now mark its lofty edifices,—elysian gardens, and statued, sparkling fountains, could scarcely have been imagined in its simple and rude aspect, under the sway of the Merovingian princes. Still, it was not without gleamings of those elements of taste and majesty, which in modern times attract and charm the lingering traveller from every clime. The fortifications erected under its Roman masters, gave it an appearance of strength and grandeur, which awed the neighboring tribes of barbarians; while here and there, the towers of a church, or abbey, showed how early the heathen temples in the Gallic clime, had been consecrated to the worship of Jehovah. 10* The Frank monarchs, who, from the time of Clovis, had yielded to the softening sway of the Christian religion, displayed in their modes of life and appendages of royalty, a comparative refinement. The midnight moon was now silvering the palace, where Charibert wielded the sceptre of France. He might have been seen, with rapid steps, traversing its intricate passages, and seeking a remote apartment. A fair young creature, with a form and movement of grace, sprang forward to meet him. He lightly touched her forehead with his lips, and as he seated her beside him, the smile on her glowing features seemed to pass under the shadow of some saddening thought. “Art weary, Bertha? I myself nearly slumbered amid the long audience I was compelled to give those Saxon strangers. I spoke heavily to the courtiers, for my heart turned towards the expecting sweet one in her lonely chamber.” He paused, but there was no reply. “Thou knowest why I sought this interview, and on what errand I came.” The gentle girl drooped her head, till the clustering raven curls veiled her face like a curtain. Passing his arm tenderly around her, he said, in a lower voice,— “Hast thou considered the proposal of Ethelbert, the King of Kent?” “Yes, father.” “Not simply King of Kent, but Bretwalda, or ruler of the Saxon octarchy. So that he is literally the sovereign, not of a separate province, but of the realm of Britain. Art thou insensible of the honor thus offered thee?” “No, father.” “Yes, father! and no, father! Laconic enough, and indifferent withal. But why this troubled brow, my daughter? To be the chosen ladye-love of a gallant and powerful monarch, need not, one would think, be quite a hopeless sorrow.” “Not a sorrow, sayest thou? to leave all that I love,— thee, and my mother, and the young brothers and sisters, with whom I have been always so happy? Not a sorrow, father, to make my home among a strange, wild people, of a foreign tongue?” “Bertha, it is woman's lot, to leave the shelter of childhood, and go forth into the field of duty; where thorns may indeed spring, but where the blessed sunbeam shines on the true-hearted. Knowest thou not this?” “Yet, dearest father, I am so young,—scarcely more than a child.” “Thy years are indeed few, but heavenly wisdom has given a ripeness to thy soul, that age sometimes fails to bring. Judge not in this matter as self-indulgence dictates. Think of the disinterestedness of parental love. Wherefore doth it nurture and train the flowrets that spring around it?—Expecting them always to grow by its side, and cheer it by their expanding beauties? Nay, my daughter; but that they may bless other hearts with their fragrance, and in rearing their own young blossoms, fulfil a higher destiny.” With an earnest, yet tremulous voice, the maiden answered,— “Ah! let me still linger under the shade of the blessed parent tree. Bid me not to leave thee. I will obey thine every word. I will study thine unspoken wishes.” Falling on her knees, she raised her clasped hands, and imploring eyes, in which large drops, like pearls, were glistening. “Tears, my Bertha! Flow they not from a deeper source than thy words have revealed? Confess: lovest thou not already?” The clear depths of the moistened eye disclosed a guileless spirit, as she assured him that her heart was free. “Yet these fierce Saxon people, so long known as pirates, and sea-kings, strike me with terror.” “A father's heart weighed every objection, ere it listened to this embassy. Remember they are no longer marauders, and adventurers, but settled in the fair island which they have won, under separate governments and advancing in civilization. The stream as it runs, refines. Ethelbert, the fourth in descent from Hengist, is called the Magnificent, as well as the brave. Consent to see him, and then decide for thyself. I promise, that no force shall be used with thy young affections; for thy happiness is my own.” “Father! I love the faith that our dear Saviour has taught. How can I wed an idolater! Can I smother within my soul the breath of eternal life, and be guiltless? Or will God give me strength, for persecution and martyrdom?” “Beloved, thou hast now told me all thine heart. I see it in the repose that steals again over thy troubled brow. Thou shrinkest back from a home among idolaters. Who knoweth but for this great purpose thou hast been called thither, to lead a Pagan prince, and his realm, to the cross of the Redeemer? Who can say, that this honor was not intended thee by God, and that holy angels are not now gazing into thy weak woman's heart, to see what it will answer.” The beautiful girl fixed a wondering, half-credulous gaze, upon the face of the king. Then a tide of great thoughts swept over her. Her dark, deep-set eyes, radiated with an unearthly light, as the mission-purpose entered into her soul. She rose involuntarily. Her slight, graceful form, in the dim ray of the night-lamp, seemed to gather majesty. She pressed the hand of her father, fondly and firmly between her own. She spoke no word, but he comprehended her. He embraced her, and departed. Long she knelt in her heart-breathed prayer, and then on her pillow settled in that unbroken slumber, which God sends the beloved ones who early repose on Him. Ethelbert, with a fitting retinue, soon arrived at the palace of the French king. The timid modesty with which Bertha appeared before him, added new charms to her loveliness. Every succeeding interview deepened the love of the royal suitor, and his desire to secure her preference. Nor did she, in his company, experience the horror she had anticipated. Legends of piratical invaders, and visions of blood-stained Jutes, which had disturbed her childish dreams, and darkened her youthful reveries, faded into thin air. In their place was a noble prince, of commanding person, and elegant costume, revealing in every action the respect and tenderness that win their way to the female heart. She could not be insensible to the devotion of a lofty spirit, or the fervor of its utterance. Her reluctance to leave her native realm vanished, and Charibert and his queen saw their beloved daughter filled with those blessed sentiments that form the happiness of a new home. In those comparatively dark ages, the Anglo Saxons surpassed not only the surrounding tribes, but the more polished nations of the East, in their chivalrous treatment of woman. Her rank in society, her position amid the household, and at the festive board,—her permitted presence at the witena-gemote, or incipient parliament, all testified their appreciation of her value, and of the influence she might exercise for good or for evil. Their earliest written laws recognized her right to inherit and transmit property, and threw a protection over her person, and over her solitary widowhood. Even in their rude state of partial civilization, they evinced the elements of that feeling, which a poet of modern Germany warmly expresses: “Honor to the women! they twine and weave heavenly roses with the web of this earthly life.” Seldom is a court, encumbered, as it is wont to be, with ceremony and heartless expediency, favorable to the growth of affection. Yet Ethelbert and Bertha, both ardent, and unembarrassed by previous intrigue or disappointment, were soon ready to inshrine each other's image in their heart of hearts. At his departure she wore the ring of the betrothed, and it was understood that his next visit was to win a queen for the throne of Kent. When the ships of the royal lover again danced over the foaming sea that separated their native strands, the affianced bride was ready to meet him, with the perfect trust of a pure and affectionate heart. Before them stretched the fair region of hope, like a newly-created Eden, whose flowery haunts no tempter had ever dared to invade. “Sometimes, my heart misgives me, Bertha, lest thy new home, compared with this beautiful Paris, may not content thee. When thou shalt walk by my side on the white cliffs of Dover—thine own cliffs—and see the huge billows heave and break far beneath the feet of their queen,—if thou shalt mark beyond them, as a faint cloud, the pleasant land of France, will thy heart still cling to mine, and the smile beam as a sunbeam from thy brow?” “The transplanted flower must soon take root, fostered by tenderness like thine. The love that I plight thee at the altar, shall be the same in all lands, through weal or woe, while life is mine.” “Ah, that altar!” he murmured, for nurtured as he was, in paganism, he had an undefined dread of the nuptial ritual that her religion imposed. “That altar, of which thou speakest, will not its appalling forms blanch thy fresh cheek with paleness? In my own land, there is a saying, that tears at a bridal, blight the buds of happiness. Bertha,—my own love,—I pray thee, let our bridal drink no pearl-drop from thine eye. Should I see but one glittering there, it would blast my joy. Forgive me this superstition.” Bertha held sacred this wish of Etherlbert. Neither the thrilling marriage responses, nor the impressive benediction of the venerable bishop who had shed the baptismal dew on her infancy; nor the parting from those who fondly cherished her earliest affections, were suffered to draw forth a tear. Around the neck of the queen, her beloved mother, she almost convulsively threw her arms, burying her face deep in the bosom where she had so often found rest. But when she raised her eyes, the long raven fringes of their lids were dry. Those who from her childhood had known her impulsive sensibility, and that she could never part from favorite playmates, even for a few days, without grief, were amazed at her self-control. They wondered that the new love should so supersede the old, as to wash away all the tender traces of memory. But they knew not that a higher purpose than the glowing hopes of personal happiness, swelled the bosom of that gentle, delicate bride, gleaming before them like a fairy vision, her rose-leaf lip slightly blanched with emotion, yet wearing the smile of an angel. They penetrated not the heaven-born motive, that, combining with the germs of conjugal affection, suddenly ripened and sublimated her whole nature. Soon after the arrival of the nuptial cavalcade at the palace, in Canterbury, the ceremony of coronation was performed. It had been an early custom of the Anglo-Saxons, to place with pomp and rejoicing, the crown on the head of the consorts of their sovereign. Ethelbert was anxious that nothing should be omitted, that could render this honor to his queen imposing and memorable to their people; and the pageantry of the scene seemed to justify the epithet of “most glorious,” which was bestowed upon him, either by the justice or the flattery of his own times. It was at the coronation dinner, that the young queen first saw the dignitaries of her new realm. At an immense oval table, loaded with a plenty, prodigal almost to rudeness, were seated, each a lady at his side, the principal earls, ealdermen, and thanes. Their flowing robes, richly bordered, were of strong and opposing colors, while the red gold of their massy bracelets and sword-hilts, made an array of barbaric splendor. She, the observed of all observers, was admired for her tasteful dress and graceful dignity of deportment. She also regarded with pleased attention, the athletic forms and fair complexions of those by whom she was surrounded, and thought the hair of the bearded chieftains becomingly adapted to their large features, parted as it was at the crown, and falling low on each side, in full floating curls. At a separate festive board, the young nobles were entertained. At its head was Prince Sobert, the heir-apparent to the throne of Essex; whose mother, being the sister of Ethelbert, had caused him to be placed under the care of his uncle, that he might be trained by his superior wisdom to the polity of kingly government. He was conspicuous by his lofty stature, and the profusion of his yellow hair, whose heavy curls rested upon his broad shoulders; as well as by his zeal in promoting conviviality, both by word and example. His rich tunic gleamed with the hues of the rainbow; as frequently rising from his seat, to pledge those around him, he raised to his lips an immense drinking-horn tipped with ivory, and wrought at the golden brim with leaves and clusters of the grape. This he seemed always to drain to the bottom. His fine complexion began to assume a blood-red tinge, and his blue eyes to radiate like orbs of flame. At length, his voice issued in huge bursts of sound, slightly modified by articulation, and still less by meaning. Then, lifting a wine-cup of silver, and calling upon his compeers to drink nobly to the fair, new queen, he emptied the massy goblet, and fell senseless on the floor. As he was borne from the hall,—his head resting helplessly on one shoulder, and his gigantic limbs spasmodically resisting, — Bertha involuntarily turned away her eyes, with a feeling of humiliation and disgust. Yet she could not but observe that the scene attracted little attention from her Anglo-Saxon subjects, who were accustomed to think the extreme of conviviality, on high occasions, by no means an indelible blemish. The royal bridegroom became daily more and more fascinated by the graces and virtues of his beautiful spouse. Her sweetness of spirit, the attractions of her conversation, the identification of her sympathies with his own,—the playfulness of her unclouded spirit, the dignity of her queenly bearing, the refinement that she strove to diffuse over his court; above all, the patience with which she sustained trials, or resigned her own wishes, were more forcible arguments to his mind than all the pungency of polemics. “Thou art so lovely, my wife, so like a sunbeam on my path and heart! How can I ever repay thee for the happiness thou hast brought me?” “By tasting the fountain from whence it flows.” “The fountain! What meanest thou? thy faith? Ah! if I could be indeed convinced that was the source of thy virtues. But no, I deem it not so; they are the spontaneous overflowings of a pure nature. Thou wouldst still be goodness itself, without thy creed.” “Nay, Ethelbert, thy too partial love perceives not, or forgets, how oft I am wayward. Before the life-giving Spirit breathed into my heart, it was sad, and in darkness. Even now, at the close of every day, have I need to humble myself for its doings, or not-doings.” “So kind, and forbearing to all beside, how is it that thou ever judgest thyself severely? Doth not our life already overflow with joy? I have always a fulness of bliss, if thou art near. What more could thy faith add?” “To the joys of this life, the hopes of another. Oh! beloved of my soul, ere the death-angel, that must divide us, cometh; I would fain see thee rejoicing in the promise that we shall dwell together forever.” The monarch was more moved by these appeals, than his words admitted. Had they been too frequent, or strongly reiterated, or attended by that gloom of manner which he had supposed an element of piety, they might have failed of all salutary effect. But the exquisite tact that accompanied them, gave them a pleasant home, and an echo like music, in his memory. “Would that the God of Bertha were my God!” was sometimes his ejaculation in solitude. Had she imagined how often, it would have inspired her with new courage. Before her departure from France, he had promised her parents that she should be neither opposed nor impeded, in the exercise of her religion; and even invited the venerab'e instructor of her childhood, to accompany her to her new home, and reside under his jurisdiction. With the generosity of a noble nature, he not only faithfully regarded, but transcended his engagements. Her retirements in her oratory, at morn and eventide, though they might, perchance, seem to him protracted, were never disturbed, and he protected her in the sacredness of those Sabbath devotions, on which she so much rested for spiritual strength and joy. For her use, he prepared the first temple that Christianity wrested from paganism in England. The traveller who now muses within the consecrated walls of St. Martin's, or beneath the gorgeous dome of St. Paul's, hears the tread of the people, like the sound of many waters, looks back reverentially, through the dimness of more than twelve centuries, to the conjugal love of their founder, Ethelbert, and the faithful heaven-rewarded piety of his queen. The pure fountains of maternal affection were unsealed for Bertha, and infant souls, like unfolding rose-buds, laid on her bosom. Supplications for their eternal welfare were mingled with the orisons which had long been duly offered for that of her beloved husband. But years sped, and there seemed no nearer approach to the accomplishment of her desires for him. Yet still her sacred fervor failed not, while patience wrought out its perfect work. At length tidings came, that strangers from a foreign coast had landed on the isle of Thanet, the very spot where, a few generations before, the brothers Hengist and Horsa had debarked, with their ferocious followers. Yet these peaceful people bore no resemblance, in character or purpose, to the fierce adventurers whom the unfortunate Britons at first invited as allies, and afterwards strove with in vain, as usurpers and conquerors. They were no Scandinavian marauders, led on by piratical sea-kings to savage conflict; but Christians from Italy and Gaul, under the auspices of the missionary Augustine. That Being, who educeth great events from causes that blind mortals account as trifles, had made the blue eyes and fair brows of some English children, exposed for sale in the slave-markets at Rome, and even the alliterative phrase on the lips of Gregory, “non Angles, sed angeli,” instrumental in the conversion of that glorious island, which now plants in almost every pagan clime, the cross of her Redeemer. This peaceful embassy sought an audience of Ethelbert. His lords and counsellors were dissatisfied at his compliance. “If you are determined,” said they, “to grant an interview to these believers in strange gods, let it not be in the royal city, or within your palace walls. Meet them on the extremity of your shores, where they now are, and listen to their words only under yon vast vaulted canopy. For they are dealers in spells and incantations, whose force the free, open air, somewhat dispels. Our advice is, therefore, that you encounter their magic under this protection.” The king, with his retinue, accompanied to the isle of Thanet, the deputation that had been sent to implore an audience. When he came in sight of the tents of the strangers, sprinkled like snow upon the rich summer-turf, he paused, and a seat was erected for him beneath the spreading branches of lofty trees. Around him ranged the nobles and pagan priests, darkly frowning, while beyond, a vast concourse of people, filled with intense curiosity, covered dale and hillock in breathless silence. Ere long, a solemn procession was seen slowly to advance. At its head came Augustine, afterwards honored with the title of the Apostle of England. A massy cross of silver was borne before him. A long train of ecclesiastics followed, walking two and two, displaying on a painted banner the effigy of the Saviour of man, and chanting hymns antiphonally, in deep, melodious tones. Ethelbert, rising from his seat, came forward to meet this singular embassy. On his mind was a soothing consciousness that the prayers of his angel wife were ascending for him. The consultation that ensued was earnest and momentous. It was observed that the monarch listened with more and more absorbed attention; and that gradually the lofty forehead of the missionary cleared itself from traces of anxious thought, and that his piercing eye gathered brightness. “We offer you,” said he, “oh king! everlasting joys, a throne that hath no end. Our religion cometh not to you with the sword, or garments rolled in blood. It boweth its knee to teach the humblest among your people. It bringeth gifts of peace and love to all, from His blessed hand who died for man's salvation.” Ethelbert answered, with a calm tone and steadfast countenance,— “Your words and promises are fair. But they are new to our ears, and uncertain. We are not prepared to change the gods of our nation, or to abandon the rites which have been common to all our tribes from the beginning. Yet you have come from afar, and borne hardships, to bring us what you believe to be good and true. We will, therefore, hospitably receive you, and supply your wants while you remain among us. We will forbid none of our subjects to listen to your words, nor permit any to be molested who may decide to become your disciples.” Delighted with the frankness and liberality of the monarch, and overjoyed at a reception so much more favorable than they had anticipated; they departed, singing anthems of praise, whose sweetly solemn echoes, softened in the hush of twilight, thrilled the hearts of the unaccustomed hearers, like mysterious melodies from the skies. Lodging and entertainment for the strangers were provided within the precincts of Canterbury, by order of the queen, to whom Ethelbert had intrusted the arrangements connected with their fitting accommodation. She zealously executed her commission, with heightened love to him, and fervent gratitude to God, who had thus opened a door for the entrance of the life-giving Gospel. The shades of a night, dark with storms, were gathering over the palace. One by one the courtiers withdrew, when, with little semblance of respect, Prince Sobert burst into the royal presence. In a tone unbefitting his youth, and with evident marks of high exasperation, he began to upbraid the king for what he called abandoning the gods of his fathers. His language became intemperate in the extreme, and his gestures those of an infuriated inebriate. Ethelbert was at first disposed to pay slight heed to the madman, but then fixing on him a stern eye, exclaimed in a voice of thunder,— “Rash young man, will there never be an end of these follies? Slave to your ungoverned passions, and to this beastly intemperance, hence! Leave the society of men, for which you are unfit.” Motioning to his guards he bade them remove him, and keep him under arrest, until he should regain a better mind. Agitated and harassed with the cares of royalty, Ethelbert retired to the apartment of the queen. He imparted to her his recent cause of perplexity, and the anxiety he had long felt for the courses pursued by the young prince, his nephew. He represented him 11 as full of generous and noble impulses, but all obscured by the growing habit of intemperance, against which every admonition was in vain. He besought her aid to extirpate this vice, to soften his waywardness, and render the son of his favorite sister, and the heir of a powerful realm, more worthy of his high destination. The perfect sympathy with which Bertha entered into his trouble, the fervent promise of whatever assistance it might be in her power to bestow, and the cheerful hope with which she spoke of His sustaining strength, who loved to seek and to save the lost, calmed his perturbed spirit, and lightened the load that had long lain heavy there. Afterwards, he often beheld, with ineffable gratitude, the wayward young prince seeking the society of the queen, half-reclining at her feet as a childlike listener, or fondling her little ones fondly in his arms. He felt how imperative was the influence of female loveliness and piety, that could thus soothe the savage and tame the lion,— “For passions in the human frame, Oft put the lion's rage to shame.” Multitudes of the Kentish Saxons were induced by curiosity to visit the stranger-teachers at Canterbury, who now assumed, in some measure, the importance of royal guests. Many were moved by the warmth of their appeals, and the sanctity of their example. Animated by an attention and success that surpassed their expectations, the missionaries extended their benevolence to the despised and humbled remnant of the Britons, who soon after their subjugation to the Roman yoke, had nominally embraced Christianity. But the lapse of nearly six centuries, with the agony of an almost exterminating struggle against their present idolatrous lords, had quenched both the hope of earth, and the light from heaven. The lives of even their clergy were so debased by ignorance and vice, that there remained scarcely a fragment of right example, or correct discipline, among the people. At length, Augustine obtained from their principal priests, a promise to meet him in Worcestershire, and confer on the subject which he proposed for their investigation. Thither they came, few in number, men of sad countenances, and a bitter spirit. He earnestly strove to convince them of error, both in doctrine and observance, and to lead them to reformation. But, suspicious and vacillating, they neither yielded to his arguments, nor were able to establish their own. A second consultation was appointed, and ere its arrival they had decided to seek the advice of an aged hermit, long renowned in that region for austere wisdom. The shades of night had gathered, and a chill rain fell like hail-drops upon the leafless trees, as, through tangled and precipitous paths, they wound their way to the cave of the recluse. With difficulty they obtained admittance. It was not until after prolonged parley, that the stone which secured the entrance, was rolled away. The glare of their torches revealed a subterranean cell, of unequal height, and a man with a forbidding aspect, apparently of great strength, but wasted by abstinence and seclusion. His long, lean limbs, protruded from a mantle of skins, in which he was scantily wrapped. Through the thick, grizzled hair and beard, that formed an almost continuous mesh, only the prominent points of his features were visible, and his cold gray eyes looked luridly forth, as if to petrify the beholder. “Wherefore come ye hither?” he cried, in a startling discordant tone. His visitants recounted their troubles, their doubts, their need of counsel, and their reverence for his reputed wisdom. Without movement of muscle, or eyelid, like one fashioned from the rock that surrounded him, he regarded their words. “More strangers, say ye? Has not the coming of strangers, and their laws, already been our destruction? Brought not Cæsar, and his legions, a new faith, upon their swords' points? Did not your Saxon lords, with the battle-axe, hew it away? And now, there come other strange men, to talk about the soul. Are there no souls in their own country, that they thus traverse sea and land to find them?” Moving his lips for a while, inarticulately, as if marshalling bitter thoughts, he exclaimed with added violence,— “The soul! what know they, or what know ye, of that mysterious thing? And ye would fain make laws for it, blind and foolish as ye are. The soul! whence cometh it? And when with the death-cry, it teareth a passage through the clay, whither goeth it? Ha! answer me! Whither?” Alarmed at his excitement of feeling, they hasted to lay before him the gifts they had brought. Without deigning a glance at them, he raised his harsh voice to a shout,— “New religions! Another god! Our fathers worshipped the blue Woden, and the Druids cut the sacred misletoe, with a knife of gold, and the bards sang to the harp the praise of heroes; and from the stateliest oak, to the smallest moss-blade,—from every grove and fountain, came the whisper of in-dwelling, and friendly spirits. Hath it ever been better with us, than with them—freely launching their wattled boats upon their own peaceful waters? Better! with British blood in your veins,— clinging to some shadow of deity, to some vile flapping bat, that nestles in the mind of your tyrannous lords? Better! rooted out, and trampled down, and finding beasts of prey more merciful than men?” And he laughed, a bitter and scornful laugh. Then, drawing himself up to his full gigantic height, till his head touched the roof of the cavern,—his eyes reddening in the torch-light with a baleful glare,—he continued to murmur in hollow whispers, and hoarse recitative, as if holding converse with demons. The Britons, inly shuddering, fancied that they heard the rushing of swift and heavy wings, mixed with unearthly shrieks. It was the swell of the tempest. After a long interval, he added in a more subdued tone,— “Ye have asked me for a sign. A sign! What is it to me, with whom ye collude, or whom ye choose for your masters,—slaves as ye are, and hypocrites,—professing to believe in Christ, yet crouching under the mace of Thor, the thunderer? For a sign ye ask me! Go your way unto this stranger-priest. If he rise to receive you, listen to his words, and obey them. If he rise not, refuse a faith that is not able to abase his pride. This is all the sign I give you. And now, go your ways, for the day breaketh.” The British prelates, superstitiously yielding to the ascetic, were content to stake on a mere accident, on the whim of a maddening brain, a negotiation so momentous. At the appointed time, they repaired to Worcestershire. Augustine, sitting under the broad shadow of an oak, chanced not to rise as they approached. Therefore, to all his arguments, they were immovable, and met every conciliatory proposal with a negative. The ravings of a semi-savage in his cavern, prevailed to neutralize the eloquence of the missionary; even though assuming somewhat of prescience, it depicted the impending evils of contumacy. Yet this disappointment was effaced by the success that awaited him amid his Saxon hearers, throngs of whom renounced the delusions of paganism. For Bertha, the faithful wife, and lovely queen, was reserved an exquisite joy,—her royal husband's avowal of his belief in the Christian religion. This event, which makes memorable in the annals of England, the year 597, was followed by the conversion of ten thousand of his subjects, who, in one day, abjured idolatry, and received the rite of baptism. Rapidly the knowledge of the truth overspread the kingdoms of Kent and Essex, until gradually the whole Saxon octarchy drank of the light that cometh down from heaven. The influence and earnest efforts of Bertha, were blessed in the reformation of the young Prince Sobert. Instilling into his mind noble sentiments, and generous plans of action, he was led to despise the animal appetites in which he once gloried, and to break the chains of the vice that had so long held him in bondage. “Clothed and in his right mind,” he became assiduous to acquire that knowledge which should enable him to advance the welfare of his future realm. His faithful and gentle monitor rested not until she had led him to the foot of the cross, and seen him fortify all his good resolutions by humbly trusting in the Friend, “strong to suffer, and mighty to save.” The reign of Ethelbert was long and prosperous. To the other cares of royalty which accumulated with years, and were deepened by his own sense of responsibility as a Christian, he added the devotion of much time and labor to the formation of a code of laws, to regulate the crude and discordant ideas of justice that prevailed among the people. To the influence of the Gospel, we probably owe this earliest specimen of Saxon jurisprudence. In retracing its various provisions, we fancy that we perceive in the double penalty which he inflicted on all crimes committed in a state of inebriation, the intense anxiety that had long preyed upon his mind for the nephew, whose training had been committed to his care, and by whose intemperance he had been so often fearfully disgraced. His gratitude for the change wrought in the young Prince Sobert, was without bounds. Next to the life-giving Spirit, whose breath renovates the sinful heart, he recognized in this blessed result, the agency of his beloved wife. When the being once so reckless, strove wisely to wield the sceptre, and to become the benefactor of his people, Ethelbert, regarding him with paternal pride, yet remembering his former horrible slavery to the most debasing of all vices, would say affectionately to Bertha, “See your own work.” But the crown of her reward, and that for which she most fervently gave thanks to the Giver of every good and perfect gift, was his tremulous whisper in retirement, “Thy hand, my wife, hath led me to the cross—thy pure example, the beauty of holiness.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“WHAT THEN?” Light was his step, his eye was bright, The youth with gesture proud,— Who thus, as Fancy prompted, spake The exulting thought aloud:— “Oh! when the blessed time shall come That studious toils are o'er, And this stern college-durance past, Like uncaged bird I'll soar.” “What then?”—a reverend sage inquired: “High honors shall be mine, And listening crowds my wisdom seek, As to a Delphic shrine,— For learning from my lips shall flow, And eloquence divine.” “What then?”—“Where'er my footsteps tend, A tide of wealth shall roll; And gems, and wine, and luxuries rare Be mine, from pole to pole,— And men shall find my nod of power Their destinies control.” 11* “What then?”—“Around my secret bower The wreaths of love I'll twine, And all that youth and beauty yield In transport, shall be mine,— Cloudless and long my life shall be Till stars of evening shine.” “What then?”—“When all hath been enjoyed That charm the ear and eye, To mortal life's extremest verge, In sculptured tomb I'll lie,— Because the sentence hath gone forth That all of dust must die.” “What then?”— A lightning flash of thought Quelled the proud spirit's dream, And conscience, with a lifted scourge, Broke in on Folly's theme,— And for the mercy of his God He learned in prayer to bow; And seek a refuge in His Love, When Time's illusive span should prove One everlasting Now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNKNOWN HEIRS. “He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.” David. “They toil for heirs, they know not who, And straight are seen no more.” Watts. His brow was worn with care. Too deep a thought Had settled there, for lingering sleep to shed Its poppy dew unblamed. He said of mirth, And every social joy,—“They profit not,” For he had sold his life to gather gain, And rear a palace for his only son, That crowds might envy. To his wearied heart Amid its slavery, still he said, “Plod on! 'Tis for my son.”—But lo!—an icy grasp O'ermastered him at once, and down he lay Reluctant and unmourned. The heir roamed wide In distant lands, with light and lavish haste Scattering his spoils. In the ancestral halls, Are guests, and banquet-board, and music-strain, But not for him.—They bear his name no more; And on his bloated features are the stamp, Of libertine and exile. In the wards Of foreign hospitals, with parching lip, He feels the fever-thirst, and none are near Of all the many servants of his sire, To give him water. On his tongue there lurks The drunkard's mutter'd curse, mixed with no word Of grateful memory for that father's care, Who toiled so late and rose ere dawn of day To toil for him the waster, and enrich Heirs, all unknown. A mother, strange to say, Repressed the claims of pity, and withheld The surplus of her stewardship from God. The poor, pale sempstress, with her trembling nerves, And timid voice, perceived the scanty dole Narrowed and grudged and tardily bestowed, And wept, despairing, o'er her lonely crust. The beggar came not twice to that proud door, Remembering the refusal, couch'd in words Scornful and sharp. The mission-vessel spread Its snowy wings, and sought a heathen clime Without her aid. And so the yearly gold Swell'd in its hoard; and to herself she said, “'Tis for my daughter's use, when I am gone:” Cheating her vexed soul with empty names Of fond maternal duty,—veil too thin To hide her nature from the eye of Heaven. Oh lady! in the damp and mouldering tomb, Is there no loop-hole, whence a restless ghost Might scan thy lofty mansion? See! behold! Who sitteth on thy daughter's rich divan, And in her costly mirrors idly looks? Who strews the flowers that deck'd her gay parterre, And revels in her fruits? A stranger bride Calls it her home.—Thy daughter is not there. Her bed is in the clay—and by her side The babe, whose fleeting life with hers was bought: While he, who briefly on his finger wore The circlet of her love, forgetteth her. Yet for that daughter didst thou grind the poor, And seal thine ear against the Pagan's moan; Calling it prudence, and a just regard To thine own offspring. 'Twas a specious lure! Oh, mother, did it shut thy soul from Heaven?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF PRINCETON COLLEGE, NEW JERSEY; JUNE 29th, 1847 A distinguished guest, on this occasion, remarks:—“The dinner, of which more than 800, principally Alumni, partook, was under a spacious and beautiful tent, on a verdant lawn, behind the old College edifice, once alternately occupied by the British and American armies. This festival was conducted entirely without spirituous or fermented beverage. Toasts drank in pure water, or lemonade, and a series of enlivening addresses, gave exhilaration and enthusiasm to the memorable scene.” An hundred years have sown The rose-cup, and the thorn, And more than thirty thousand days Diffused the light of morn,— And in their mighty cradle slept, Since Old Nassau was born. Look to yon tented lawn, Enrobed in glorious green, Where winds the long procession on Amid the classic scene,— And birthday melodies arise As to a crowned queen. She hath no hoary hair, No dimness marks her eye, Her children cluster round her side As when her youth was high,— And at the festal board she pours The nectar of the sky. Such nectar as the Sun Exhales in crystal tears, And filters through the silvery cloud, The fruitful earth that cheers,— So, here's a health to Old Nassau For another hundred years.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER TO FEMALES. “Sisters, and friends,—come, let us talk awhile, 'Twill do no harm.— Heaven grant it be for good.” Gordon. We, my dear friends, to whom are intrusted the structure of domestic life, and the framework of families, are the natural and interested guardians of temperance and purity. Without these, there can be for us neither happiness nor safety. Presiding not only over the rites of hospitality, but over those seasons of refreshment around the household board, which return as duly as morn, noontide, and evening vary the sky and landscape, are we fully aware of the responsibilities of our office? Home, that green, sheltered islet, amid the great waves of an unquiet world, is our blessed province. Have we considered the dignity of the sphere in which we are thus placed?—a realm, whose antiquity is coeval with the creation; whose foundation and laws are the work of almighty wisdom; whose constitution consults both the necessity and the highest good of its subjects; whose chief ministers are of kindred interests and kindred blood; whose reverence is drawn from the deepest, least fluctuating resources of humanity, and the results of whose policy are as sublime and boundless as eternity? Is it not important that we should correctly estimate our position, and its influences? The keen eye of philosophy long since discerned, that to have power over the senses, was to hold the key of the mind. “Let me make the songs of a nation,” said a wise man, “I care not who makes the laws.” Has the ear then such authority? and has not power over it been delegated to those who rule a household? Is not his ear ours, who has installed us as the presiding spirit over his hearth and home? Is it not ours for the melody of hallowed sentiment?—for the eloquent interchange of knowledge?—for the charms of music?—for that highest of all harmonies to man's heart,—the voice of love? Are not all in the domestic department, thus modified? The infant, who, being a part of the mother, draws in her tones with the food that sustains, and the smile that cheers it; the child, who perchance will take onward to gray hairs, or to the grave, her voice, as the only unforgotten lesson; the daughter, whose dawn of womanly beauty is heightened by the docility with which she listens to her beloved guide; the son, who, going forth to the trials of the world, lingers for one more accent of her perfect affection;—even the servant, watchful of words, as well as of example,—the guest,—the stranger within the gates,—each and all are thus influenced:—how much, another world will more clearly unfold. Can we, then, be too careful of tones?—of things uttered?—of the spirit-harp, on which we are permitted to play? Lest, peradventure, our careless touch might untune it for the brief concert of earth,—the purer melody of heaven! If, by the respect due to our station, the ear is subjected to us, is not the eye ours also?—ours, for the charm of a cheerful countenance,—for the fascinations of grace and kindness,—for the beauties of a well-ordered home,—for that symmetrical adjustment of economy with comfort, which those who fill the throne of a household should be able to exhibit? There are some apartments, which, from the carpet to the pictures on the wall, are a lesson of refined taste and harmony of color. There are others, unadorned by aught save neatness, which, in the absence of all ornament, are still more admirable to an accurate observer, from their fitness, and the balance of circumstance with duty. The arrangements, and costume of the mistress of the family, may display elegance, but if they go beyond the finances of her husband, they lose that beauty of adaptation which is necessary to please a clear-judging mind. Indeed, where ornament may be allowed without improper expenditure, simplicity, rather than gorgeousness, has more complete power over a true taste, and longer retains it. The attraction of flowers, within and around a habitation, is in accordance with His plan, “whose touch perfumes them, and whose pencil paints.” This makes the cottage-homes of England sweet to their inmates, and a pleasant memory to the passing traveller. The simple plants require little labor of culture, and a good spirit seems to prevail where they are reared. It is beautifully designated by the Germans, as the “angel of the flowers.” Its ministry is to charm the senses, and teach the heart a lesson of His love, who thus deigns to make even the field and the wayside beautiful. If it has been felt, that the eye and ear are such powerful ambassadors to the soul, that Devotion has appealed to them in the Gothic arch, the storied window, and the solemn organ, and War labored to enlist them by pomp and circumstance; and if these two direct avenues are open to woman, will she not enter them, bearing the symbols of temperance and of virtue? When such power was delegated by civilized society to the weaker hand, was there not an expectation that it would be made an ally of those principles that give to that civilized society permanence and peace? The eye and the ear, then, it would seem, are among the legitimate subjects of those who rule home wisely. Are not the appetites, also, a part of their legislation? “The way to a man's heart is through his stomach,” said a caustic writer. Without fully indorsing the sentiment of the satirist, it is evident, that by supervision of the table, the elements that refresh weariness, cheer depression, sustain physical vigor, and minister to social delight, are among the perquisites of our sex. Mighty instruments, in this our combination of matter with mind. Let us see how they are applied. Thou, who spreadest the household board, say, why is this or that alluring condiment and perilous beverage added? To show how cunningly agents unfriendly to health, may be disguised by culinary chemistry?—how far indulgence may go, yet stop short of actual inebriation? Or to test and trouble the feeble virtue of children, by bidding them abstain from what they see others partake? and disturb their trust in your own Christian sincerity, by setting an example which they are forbidden to follow? Yet even where there is no allurement to absolute intemperance, the effect of habitual absorption in the pleasures of the table, and their preference to intellectual enjoyments, are so pernicious to the young, that the ultimate ruin of families may be frequently traced to that source. But, if any strangely fancy that they possess the power, ad libitum, to weaken the body, or darken the minds of those, who, by the structure of the family state, are committed to their care and love; by what right or edict do they exercise this Circæan policy over strangers and guests? Thou, who makest a feast, whence this increased activity in the mixture of dangerous elements?—this array of excitement and the means of intoxication? What evil hath the stranger done, that thou shouldst send the physician to his lodgings?—or perhaps deepen in him that plague-spot which no physician can heal? The invited guest came trustingly under thy roof, beguiled by words of courtesy. Send him not away sickened or sorrowing, but cheered by that simple, safe entertainment, which has left your own thoughts unwearied and fresh for the social intercourse, appropriate to beings who have a mind as well as a body. Surely, no housekeeper, or mother, would deliberately make the sacred rites of hospitality, or the table where her “olive-plants” daily gather, in their blossoming hope, subservient to gluttony and intemperance, or to the education of habits that might lead to vices so degrading. It is happily now, less the custom than formerly, to press as a mark of welcome or pledge of hospitality, the draught that may inebriate. Still, it is not extinct. And though, in the majority of cases, it may be harmless, can we be sure that it is so in all?—that it might never serve as fuel to some latent taste, subdued with difficulty, and which, but for our temptation, might possibly have been overcome? If it is asked, why the Christian inhabitants of a most Christian land should choose, as the herald of their hospitality, the pledge of their friendship, an usage as dangerous as the sword of Damocles, we hear only the answer,—“ It is the fashion.” To the inquiry, how woman, whose safety is so deeply involved in the moral purity of the land, should venture to tamper with the foundations of temperance,—still the same answer, “It is the fashion.” It has been seriously demanded by the guardians of virtue and religion, why she should ever be faithless to her sacred trust, and she hath herself answered,— “It is the fashion.” When, to efface a stigma from national character, the philanthropist and statesman are combining their energies, it becomes not those of humble name or obscure station, to remain inactive. Our sex, depending by physical weakness as well as the structure of refined society, on the protection of others, has immense interests at stake in the prevalence or suppression of that lunacy, which may transform protectors into murderers. The plea of want of influence is not available, since far-sighted politicians admit that no vice can obtain great preponderance in a civilized community, without the permission of females. If the cause of temperance, which has made such advances, has still a giant's labor to perform, let us not withhold the aid that, in our province of home, it is our part to render. Can we, whose duties and felicities are interwoven with the conjugal and maternal relations, be too vigilant against whatever threatens to desecrate our sanctuary? Sisters and friends! who in your own regulated tastes, have no temptation to excess of animal indulgence, who without effort abstain from all that could cloud the mind, or inflame the passions, are you thus absolved from further responsibility? Is not the prevention of evil in others, according to the measure of your ability, a duty? To the teaching of example, are we not bound to add the weight of that influence which the courtesy of an enlightened age, and the condescending spirit of the religion of Jesus, has in these latter days accorded to us? Secure in our own unfallen estate, is it not possible that regret or remorse may in future years extort the confession,—“We are verily guilty concerning our brother?” If the spoiler may yet effect an entrance at the fireside, —the household board,—the nursery,—have we nothing to do? We, whose fondest affections take root at that fireside,—who, at that household board have precedence and power,—to whom that nursery is the garner of the dearest hopes, for time and eternity, can we trace amid those hallowed retreats the footsteps of a foe, and not tremble? Wife!—who by solemn vows, before men and angels, hast entered into an union that death alone can dissolve, has it been your fate to see the vice of intemperance casting deadly shadow over the heart, where your highest earthly confidence reposed? And day by day, and hour after hour, as you watched its fearful ravages, were you careful not to upbraid, not to provoke, not to argue reproachfully; but to repress your own sense of suffering,—to make home desirable,—to revivify those affections, which are the fountains of purity and joy? Above all, were your supplications unceasing to Him, who alone can turn the heart, as the rivers of waters are turned? Then, though the harvest of your toils may have perished,—though the desolation of your peace nothing earthly can solace,—still, you will have escaped the rankling torture of the reflection, that you are verily guilty concerning him who was “your more than brother, and your next to God.” Mother!—whose duties are laid deeper than any vow of the lips, even in the immutable strength of a love that cannot swerve,—did you counsel your children in this matter, “rising early, and late taking rest?” With the developments of character, did you strive to impress the control of the appetites,—the excellence of pleasures derived from intellect and benevolence,—the true heroism of subjugating the flesh to the spirit? Did you oppose with your authority every infraction of these principles? Did you warn them of the infirmity of their nature,—of the trials, the tempters that await them,— of their need to seek help from above? At dawn, and at the hush of midnight, was there a fervent lifting up of your soul, that they might be “temperate in all things?” Still, should it be your lot to behold one whom you had nurtured, stain the heritage of his athers, and go down to a drunkard's grave, may it never be your fearful doom to stand at the bar of the High Judge, and say,— “I am verily guilty concerning”— whom? Not the brother, whose course you might have been unable to influence,—not the husband, whom it was never your prerogative to control,—but the child, whom you brought into life, and loved more than life;—the child, for the first pencillings on whose soul you were accountable, intrusted to you as it was, like unsullied wax, to be stamped with the signet of Heaven. Yet there are other evils than those that flow from excess in drinking, which they who would be “temperate in all things,” must avoid. There are other excitements than those of the table, which it is our duty, both by example and precept, to discourage. One is the stimulus of light conversation, vernacularly called gossip, in which the integrity of facts is too often sacrificed to their embellishment. Our position as a sex supplies a redundancy of such subjects, while a desire of adding novelty, or variety to soci I intercourse, gives to slight circumstances undue inflation and expansion. Censoriousness springs less frequently from unkind feeling, than from the ambition of surpassing others in pungency of narration. The flattering verdict of possessing wit, must be maintained, though a fair reputation suffer, or a weak one fall. Even kindly disposed natures may be led to this intemperate mode of serving up character, by the tastes and habits of those around. But on the hard heart, the tongue may sharpen itself, till one becomes a spear, and the other a millstone. If thou art bidden to a feast of mangled reputations, 12 sit not unduly long, nor lift with complacence the cup in which thy neighbor's faults are infused. Through the same process of fermentation thine own good name may also pass, for at the wine-press of slander, there is no respect of persons. The sour grape that setteth the teeth on edge, and the rich cluster from the valley of Eshcol, which the Lord commended,—go in alike,—and the mingled wine is pleasant to the perverted palate. Doth it not behoove us rather to uplift the banner of a charity that “thinketh no evil?” For, in the words of a fine writer, “if we are capable of showing what is good in another, and neglect to do it, we omit a duty,—we omit to give rational pleasure, and to conciliate right good-will. Nay more, are we not abettors, if not aiders in the vilest fraud,—the fraud of purloining from respect? Being intrusted with letters of great interest, what a baseness not to deliver them!” The influence of words and sympathies, is seldom fully estimated. Like the falling pebble in the stream, they are surrounded by circles far beyond their own circumference, which continue to widen, after the parent cause is buried and forgotten. The words and sympathies of woman, though moving in a narrow and secluded sphere, have peculiar force of propagation. They are not impeded in their action, by those pre-occupations of prejudice, rancors of political strife, or intrigues of state, with which the eloquence of man contends. They often fall on soil, prepared for their reception, by the dews of infancy,—the sunny skies of childhood,—or the tranquil culture of friendship and affection. Can our responsibility on their account be too strongly impressed? In the fumes of vanity there is also a species of intoxication, to which our sex, from their position, are exposed. A young female,—especially if possessing beauty or accomplishments,—is often nurtured with the food of adulation. But, in her ultimate sphere of action, she finds a different aliment, to which it would have been well, if the mental appetite had been early trained. The essence of conjugal and maternal duty, is disinterestedness. The undue study of dress, the extravagant expenditure of time and money, for luxuriant display, the predominance of self as a ruling motive, should pass away, as the dawn when the sun ariseth. The true happiness of our nature is in doing good,—in conferring, rather than in receiving benefits. The holy estate of matrimony is made more holy, by its facilities for these ends. A well-ordered, agreeable home, is both a preventive to vice and a refuge for those who have been “hurt by the archers.” Strength is given us here, that we may do an angel's work. The preponderance of pursuits comparatively trifling, is hazardous. For though none of the employments that minister to the comfort of domestic life, however minute in detail, or lowly in character, should be overlooked or despised, yet time must be reserved for the culture of intellect, for retaining knowledge once acquired, and increasing its store by those who would desire to maintain durable empire over the heart. The first enthusiasm of youthful love must suffer abatement. It has been aptly compared to the “shadow of early morning, decreasing as the day advances.” That in its transition it may take the form of that more sober and sublimated affection, which deepens till the sunset of life, and blends with the parting smile a pledge of deathless reunion, it must be fortified by a steadfast mental, moral, and religious progress,—an elevation in the scale of being, which labors to bear upward those whom best it loves. A too excitable temperament is to be guarded against. Its tendency is to cloud the judgment, and impair those defences which our weakness needs. The domination of passion, partakes of the frenzy of intemperance in drinking. It destroys the balance of thought, and the sway of reason. It “taketh away the armor in which we trusted, and divideth the spoils.” The loss of clear intellectual guidance, even for brief and long separated intervals, is not safe for those who often find their best wisdom inadequate to the trials and emergencies of life. Would the helmsman, amid shoals and quicksands, occasionally lay aside his vigilance, trusting that any error, thus committed, might be rectified in his future course? Should the bird of passage linger, and lose sight of its leader, might it be sure to join the flock unscathed, when its reverie was over? And must not she, who holds the helm of a household, and would so pass this troubled pilgrimage, as not to miss with them the “Better Land,” spread the safe sail of a meek and quiet spirit, and labor to preserve, amid blast and billow, the serenity of a self-possessed mind? Wealth is also said to have an inebriating tendency, which its possessors are not always able to withstand. Through its excitements, pride mounteth to the brain, and the mind dwelleth only upon its own greatness, and the heart, having no unsatisfied want, forgetteth how to sympathize, and its alms become ostentation, and the charity, that might have made them acceptable to God, hath no part in the matter. Even the fine eyes of youth become so sprinkled with the sleep of self-indulgence, as to see dreamily, both this life and the next. Gold and silver, like the poppy-poison, lay the heart in the grave, while the body lives. Let those who are in danger of such inebriations, temper the exultation of riches, by a sense of the stewardship they involve,—the reflection how soon they must resign them for the poverty of the grave, and learn the philosophy that pronounced at the close of life, nothing its own, save that which it had given away. And now, dear friends, I take my leave, having had pleasure in this interview. As it regards the sight of the countenance, or sound of the voice, we may be strangers; yet has this intercourse made you to me, as friends. Perchance, oceans separate us; still it seemeth as if we sate side by side. We have seen that ability is committed to us, to make home the nursery of virtue;—and that to be “temperate in all things,” it is not sufficient simply to shun the wine-cup, and the glutton's feast. We have together contemplated some of the dangers that surround us,—some of the temptations which we must repel, for the sake of those whom we love. Other dangers and temptations might also have been pointed out. But the field is broad, and time, with me is short. I have scattered a few seeds, whose fruits may be gathered, when I am gone;—a few hints, which you will expand and illustrate in the beauty of your example. “There is no service, said Lord Bacon, comparable to good counsel,—since no man can do so much for us, as we may do for ourselves: and good counsel helpeth us to help ourselves.” A still greater teacher, incites us to add to “knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly-kindness; and to brotherly-kindness, charity.” May the spirit of this glorious climax animate and uphold us, while we labor to grave on the signet-ring of this fleeting life, the motto, “temperate in all things.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WOMAN'S PATRIOTISM. How shall we aid the land we love? O'er dusty tomes to pore, And catch the warrior's wrathful mood From Amazonian lore?— To turbulence, or pride incite, And quench of peace the angel light? Relinquish for a meteor's glare The boon of Love's protecting care? Ambition's wind-swept heights assail, And shun the sweet, secluded vale?— No, sister, no. How aid our land?—The boastful voice In public haunts to raise? Or barter for a fickle fame Affection's priceless praise? For “Woman's Rights” to clamor loud, And dare the throng, and face the crowd? Or wrapped in wild desire to roam Forfeit those charities of home, That pain can soothe, and grief control, And lull to harmony the soul?— No, sister, no. In her own place, the hearth beside, The patriot's heart to cheer, The young, unfolding mind to guide, The future sage to rear,— Where sleeps the cradled infant fair, To watch with love and kneel in prayer, Cheer each sad soul with pity's smile, And frown on every latent wile That threats the pure, domestic shade, Sister,—so best our life shall aid The land we love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PRECIOUS GIFT. ON SEEING A GOLD CHAIN, AMONG THE CONTRIBUTIONS, AT A MEETING FOR TEMPERANCE. Would that ye had a voice, ye links of gold, To tell me of your giver.

Wert thou the favored talisman of love?— Or friendship's bright memento? Still, 'tis well That thou art here.—For now, that love may be Remembered by the deeds that bless mankind; And holiest friendship, might be well content With such a token. Stranger! who perchance Didst find this graceful ornament awake The throb of vanity,—we give thee praise For this, thy wise exchange. The pleasant thoughts Of pure benevolence, which they who live 12* Only for self, know not,—be thy reward, And crown thy life with joy. Still be thou true To Pity's angel-prompting. What thine hand Findeth in duty's sphere, do with the might Of woman's tenderness. By flowery bands Of soft persuasion, draw the wanderer back, From ruin's slippery verge. Toil to uproot Those weeds of vice, that by the wayside spring, And e'en amid our garden's choicest flowers Unblushingly intrude.

      <field name="fulltext">THE SPOILER. Parent,—who with speechless feeling O'er thy cradled treasure bent, Every year new charms revealing, Yet thy wealth of love unspent: Hast thou seen that blossom blighted By a drear, untimely frost? All thy labor unrequited,— Every glorious promise lost? Wife,—with agony unspoken, Bending 'neath affliction's rod, Is thy prop,—thine idol broken, Fondly trusted, next to God?— Husband,—o'er thy hope a mourner, Of thy chosen friend ashamed, Hast thou to her burial borne her, Unrepentant, unreclaimed? Child,—in tender weakness turning To thy heaven-appointed guide, Doth a lava-poison burning Change to gall affection's tide? Still that orphan burden bearing, Darker than the grave can show, Dost thou bow thee down despairing To thine heritage of woe?
