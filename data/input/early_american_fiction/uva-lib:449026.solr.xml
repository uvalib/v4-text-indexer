      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. “Who sees not the bottom, let him not pass the water.” Miss Herbert went in, on her way to her sister's, to Steinberg's music-shop. He was not there. The door was ajar that communicated with a little inner parlor; and while she was tossing over some sheets of music on the counter, she heard voices. One was cheerful, and familiar; the other low, and “full of tears.” “Letty,” said Lisle, “I see you are not well—you are working too hard.” “Oh no, indeed I am not; my work is my life.” “Then the children torment you?” “No, Archy, they are very good, and they love me, and I love them.” “Then the long and the short of it is, our evening lessons are too much for you. I shall come no more.” “Oh, Archy, don't say so.” “What is the use, Letty, of wearing yourself out? You read German well enough, and you are learning of the Steinbergs to speak it charmingly.” “Well, Archy, do as you think best; it must be a weary task for you.” The meek are not always blessed! “No indeed, dear Letty, it is a pleasure—a very great pleasure.” “Then continue to come; do, Archy—I have no other pleasure,” she added, in a more cheerful tone; but the last word did not reach Grace's ear, for the children at this moment made an inroad, followed by old Steinberg, who passed into the shop. He was interrupted in his excuses, by Grace asking if those were his children? “Mein Gott! no, Miss Herbert; my old woman and I are not Abraham and Sarah. These are my grand-children that Mr. Lisle, that gentleman in there, God bless him, took charge of from Germany, and has brought us the best little governess for them. You speak German, will you look in upon them?” While Grace hesitated, Lisle came into the shop. The sight of Miss Herbert checked him. He blushed, merely bowed, and passed on. The blush, only a suffusion caused by the sudden meeting, recalled Mrs. Milnor's gossip at Mrs. Tallis' reception. Grace gave no faith to it then, or now; but her curiosity was awakened, and her feminine imagination had woven a tissue out of Letty's sweet and sad tones; so she graciously accepted the old man's invitation, and followed him. She recognized at the first glance the pale, pretty girl in half mourning whom she had seen at the opera. “Excuse,” said old Steinberg, addressing Letty, “this is Miss Herbert, just looking in upon the little ones.” At the sound of this name, Letty's pale cheek reddened, and her soft, meek eye met Grace's. Both gazed inquiringly, and both, feeling the gaze might be offensive, averted their eyes. Letty shrinking from the potent lady, whom it seemed presumption to regard as a rival, and Grace averting her eye with a feeling that might be thus translated into words: “Had that fellow, Belson, the audacity to eye this sweet, modest young woman with suspicion? How savage was Mrs. Milnor's gossip!” “My friend, Mr. Lisle—or rather your friend,” she said, “for I believe he is much more your's than mine—is your teacher?” “My teacher!” exclaimed Letty, overpowered by the grace of Miss Herbert's practiced manner; “oh! no; Mr. Lisle is not my teacher, not at all—he only—that is—I mean he only comes.” “To give you German readings,” said Grace, smiling, and anxious to relieve poor Letty's embarrassment. “I know no man one would rather call master in all `arts and moralities,' than Mr. Lisle.” “So, so—just so!” exclaimed old Steinberg, rubbing his hands; “but, Miss Herbert, I have not told you my little ones' names yet.” This duty he eagerly did, and Grace, after kindly chatting with them, to their delight, in German, took her leave. Letty heaved a sigh, as if lifting a load from her heart. Afterward, the following sentences, blotted, with tears, were found in her private diary: “We have different spheres. Theirs is the same—mine immeasurably below them. But her love is not like mine! She speaks of him without faltering. The very sound of his name touches my heart's main-spring. “Go on, bright, noble, captivating woman! Fulfill your destiny and his—and oh, may I be hidden in His merciful arms, who will forgive his weak and erring child, that she loved the creature more than the Creator!” As Grace emerged from Steinberg's shop, she met Horace Copley. He, of course, joined her, and after some common-place references to the affliction in her sister's family, he said, surveying her appreciatingly, “What becoming mourning you have selected!” “My milliner must have the credit of it,” said Grace, blushing, “for I have been but once out of the house since our little boy's death.” Grace's blush was due to the thought that the exception was her visit to Ida Roorbach. “I am delighted to meet you just now,” resumed Copley; “I have something special to say to you.” “Not yet—oh, not quite yet!” Grace would have said, but she merely murmured “Well?” “It is well—or will be, I trust,” he replied. Grace felt a recoiling as, looking up at Copley, she met one of those inquisitorial glances by which he seemed to divine her inmost thoughts. His face reverted to its ordinary expression, as incommunicative as the cover of a book. He proceeded coolly, “This demission of your brother-in-law is a sad affair.” Grace breathed a long breath. “I mean of course, as a matter of discretion—with his family, and in his state of health. It occurred to me that I might do him a small service in this exigency. The President is my friend. He owes me a good turn. I have written to the White House, and the answer is every thing I could wish. Of course, nothing of this should transpire till we ascertain whether Mr. Esterly will accept the appointment. There are many applicants for it, and it is a delicate matter to manage these affairs so as to give the least possible offence in political quarters. Political adherents, like lovers, are not fond of others' leavings. Will you speak to your brother-in-law? I am not in his good graces—he is, you know, whimsical—he may not relish accepting a favor from me, but will be quite willing to owe it to you—as it would be idle to deny that he does.” “Oh, no—to you, and a most seasonable kindness it is. My brother is not whimsical—he may perhaps be prejudiced.” Nothing so common-place, as the old adage of “killing two birds with one stone,” probably occurred to Mr. Horace Copley, but he smiled to the very inmost fold of his heart as 1* he perceived he had hit one mark. Worldly-wise as he was, he marred his advantage the very next time he opened his lips. Truly, “the devil is subtle, but weaves a coarse web.” “I should not perhaps have said,” he resumed, “that Mr. Esterly is whimsical, but, poor fellow, he is impracticable. It was an imprudent step to throw up his rectorship. A man who has a wife and children can not afford to follow out his speculative notions—his duties to them are paramount—” “To truth?” Grace thought, and would have said, but that her attention was suddenly arrested by two men who stood on the steps of Esterly's church, and just in the shadow of its arched entrance. They were talking earnestly, and seemed watching Grace and Copley as they turned into the gate leading to the parsonage which adjoined the extreme end of the church. Twice the men moved forward, as if to follow them, and then retreated. In the mean time Copley rang the door-bell, and the bell not being immediately answered, Grace observed that all the blinds were closed. “Ah, I remember,” she said, “they were going out of town for a day or two.” Just then, a shuffling step was heard in the entry, and Diana, the old colored cook first opening the side-blind, and peeping out, unbolted the door, and opening it, hastily said, “It's you, Miss Grace—Lord o' macy! come in. Come in, Mr. Copley—step quick, please sir.” “Why, what is the matter, Diana?” said Grace; “what has happened?” “Nothing has happened to our folks, it's only to me and mine.” Big tears rolled down Diana's black cheeks; she wiped them away with the end of her white turban. Diana's coiffure was very unlike the goddess' whose name she illustrated. Grace took a long breath, but her more immediate fears relieved, her interest turned to the poor old petted servant whose alarm and agitation were pitiable. “Do come into the parlor, Miss Grace,” she said; “please follow, Mr. Copley.” She turned again to the window, and took a survey through the lattice. “The hounds is gone, for the present,” she continued, “but the Lord have macy on us, they'll come back, there's no saving of her.” “Who are they, Diana?” asked Grace. “What are they after?” “What!—why, Miss Grace—Vi'let! True as you live! and her little boy.” “Violet and little Prince! Is Augustus' wife a slave, Diana?” “She is that—we never let on about it—'case, says I to 'Gus, when you set a secret a travelin', you never knows how far it will go, nor whose doors it will go into. But they got wind of it somehow—them that's mean enough to turn aginst their own color—and they informed. Vi'let says there's been evil eyes round 'em for a month. As God lives, for every penny them gets for hunting down their fellow-sufferin' creters, they shall 'count to him who marks all their tears and groans, and flutterin's. `Ashes always flies back in the face of them that throws' em.' Vi'let says they had a larum every hour that set their hearts a beatin' like a drum. Last night Gus' brought them here, hopin' Miss Eleanor would open up a way somehow for em', and maybe she would, for she's kind o' 'raculous at helpin' folks in 'stress, but la! she's gone, and Mr. Esterly and I am here alone to fight it out with them fellows. They had just been here with a sarch-warrant before you came. The Lord 'spired me to put mother and child out on the roof, down agin the church. They sarched every hole and cranny—up stairs and down, under the beds, in old barrels, and up the chimnies, I followin' round, and tryin' to look as if I wern't afeard of nothin'. But, la sus! Miss Grace, I've lived too long in our family to be handy at lyin' any way. I was all of a nerve and a tremble. At last, says the tall one to the little snub, `John,' says he, `we may as well gubs it up this time;' and as soon as I was redy of 'em, I called in Vi'let and Prince. Poor gal! her heart is a breakin' all the while, for she knows it's only a lull, and she and Prince have got to quit 'Gus, and go back to slavery. Ah, Miss Grace, that's a boy! that Prince—there's nothin he don't know—he can play a tune on the Jews-harp, and sing, `Saints are rejoicin', Sinners are a tremblin' from first to last. Oh, I had rather give my eyes, and my right arm too, than to lose him—but I've got to—I've got to!” Here the poor creature was choked with sobs, but her indignation overpowering her grief, “My curse,” she said, clenching her hands, and raising them, “my curse, as long as I can speak it, shall follow them folks down to Washington that made the arm of the law long enough and strong enough to wrench away our own children, do what we will!” “Oh, Di'!” said Grace, “dear old Di', they shall not take your children from you; Violet shall come home with me, I will conceal her till I find some way of saving her. I will sell my last gown rather than let her go from you.” “Ah, but, Miss Grace, they'll ask too dear; they 've got no bowels, and so they think nobody else has got 'em.” “Never fear, Di'—`where there's a will, there's a way,' you know. But how shall we get her to Bond-street?” And turning to ask Copley's advice, she saw he was standing with his back to her at the end of the room, absorbed apparently in contemplating a small picture of herself which he had taken from the wall to get a stronger light upon it. “Oh, come here, Mr. Copley,” she said with a slight tone of impatience, “have you not heard poor Di's story?” “Most assuredly, every word of it.” “Then can't you advise, or devise for us?” “No,” he replied, his tone now indicating a cordial interest that enchanted Grace; “but I will execute whatever your quicker wits devise.” Grace snapped her fingers, an apt action with her, denoting the rapid movement of her brain. “I have it,” she exclaimed. “Diana, is not Violet about my height and size?” “Close on't, Miss Grace, close on't—the same pretty fall of the shoulders, too, and kind o' proud set of the head.” “Very well—it will be dark in half an hour. Violet shall dress herself in my gown, bonnet, shawl, scarf, and veil, and go in my place, arm in arm with Mr. Copley, to Bond-street. If these men are still lurking about here, they will be deceived. Will you play your part, Mr. Copley?” “With most entire satisfaction, provided Mistress Violet's arm is a hostage for yours.” Grace, in her eagerness to carry her plan into effect did not apprehend the full import of his words. She gave him her hand in playful ratification of their compact, and at that moment Copley did not much err in inferring from the animation of her face, that she would not shrink from the strict construction that his most sanguine hope gave to the action. “Not a word from you, Dian!” said Grace, “are you not satisfied?” “La, ma'am, yes,” answered poor Di, looking desperately bedroofed, “but you've forgot Prince; they'll hold Vi'let by her heart-strings if they get Prince.” Grace's countenance fell. “I did forget little Prince,” she said. “Leave Prince to me,” said Copley; “I give you my word he shall be cared for.” Diana was content. The colored people have a feudal dependence on the word of “a real gentleman,” in their acceptation of the term. She went to summon her daughter-in-law, who presently came, a graceful, young mulatto woman. Her beauty, alas! as well as her youth and strength, had its money value. Her boy was clinging to her gown, as Ishmael does to Hagar's in Da Vinci's picture. His fine head and face were nature's protest against the state to which he was doomed. At first Violet seemed dissatisfied with an arrangement that separated her from him, but when Dian had reiterated Copley's assurance, and whispered something of which Grace heard the words “rich” and “her suitor,” she seemed partly reassured, and went up stairs with Grace to prepare for her masquerading. In the mean time old Dian's heart expanded as did the Genii, when the box was opened, he in smoke, she in words. “La, sus! I wonder what 'Gus will say when he hears it all. He's gone to Hartford with the brass band. You know, Mr. Copley, 'Gus beats all on the tamborine—there's nothing he loves so well, 'cept Vi'let and Prince. Why, Mr. Copley, if our hearts is down in our shoes, he'll come in and take down his tamborine and rise 'em right up. No wonder 'Gus sets by Vi'let—she's been raised like a lady. Are you 'quainted with the Guthries down in Caroliny, Mr. Copley?” “I have heard of them.” “I s'pose so. They're one of the first families, and by Vi'let's tell, quality to the back bone. Vi'let was three years older than Miss Angelica Guthrie. She was set off to wait on her—that's the way down there. They grew up together inch by inch, and Vi'let says their hearts twined together just like roots of a potted plant. She says Miss Angelica was like her name—angel was the biggest part of her; she was a feeble little piece; and sights o' watching and tending Vi'let had to do, but she loved her misses all the better for that, you know; and when Miss Angelica married Massa Tom Crampton, Vi'let went with her in course. But as handsome as Massa Tom 'peared, Vi'let did not quite trust him—'case, you see, he was a gay blood, and somehow sarvents find out the real in their massas afore the quality does. However, things went pretty straight for a year. They went down to Charlestown and had a pretty gay winter, but when they came back to the plantation, Vi'let says, Miss Angelica gets feeble, and Massa Tom gets tired—men can't help it, you know; 'tis kinder tiresome when the missesses gets sickly—and he goes off to the races. She had no children, and Massa Tom took to gambling, and carrying on, and so forth. Vi'let says they mostly do—the young youth, 'case they have not got nothing else to do. Vi'let says she knows many good old parents that go down to the grave. I don't argify with Vi'let, but says I to myself, they need not—why don't they give their slaves free, and make their boys work, and then they would crown their hoary heads; as the Bible says, `Buy t'other world with this, and so win both'—that's it, Massa Copley. But Vi'let's always speaking up for 'em, 'specially the missesses. She says they are so kind, and gen'rous, and pious. Vi'let's heart is as tender as a spring chicken. She says they feel the curse of slavery more than the slaves do, and more than the abolitioners do; and some day they'll shake it off, for Vi'let says the day is a comin' when they can't stand it no longer, for their lands are a runnin' down, and their children are a runnin' down, and their consciences are a gnawin', and their hearts are a risin'; but says I to Vi'let, `Why don't they make a beginnin'? I want you to 'splain that!'” “Are there shad in the market yet?” asked Copley. The old woman started at this sudden obstruction to her flow of earnest feeling. After recovering herself, she replied, “I think there be, sir; but my young misses is prudent, and never buys 'em at the dearest.” Poor Dian left the room crest-fallen. As she mounted the stairs to look after Violet's toilet, she muttered, “S'pose I did run on like a house a'fire, he need not throw cold water in my face! He's a terrible fine gentleman, but he an't good enough for our folks arter all.” Grace reappeared with her protegée. Copley surveyed the young mulatto. “There is an endowment of grace and refinement in your very shawl and hat, Miss Herbert!” he said. “Oh, no,” replied Grace, “she is to that manner native. Now take her under your ward and watch, and don't forget to send a carriage at eight.” “Forget!” he exclaimed, and then turning back from the door, as if at a second thought, he added, “Unfortunately I have a business engagement, and can not come with the carriage.” The “business engagement” was an appointment to look over, with Mrs. Tallis, some Paris costumes for a fancy ball. Grace saw by the lighted street lamp that the men in wait did not follow, and she rightly inferred that they were satisfied that the parties who went out were the same who entered a half-hour before. “Well, my dear child, what do you propose to do next?” asked Mr. Herbert, to whom Grace was confiding Violet's story. “Mrs. Herbert will find excellent reasons why you should not make her house a house of refuge.” “My dear uncle I shall beware of encroaching on Mrs. Herbert. She always takes the prudent side, and there are plenty of ready-made reasons in the world's economy for that. I only hesitate to tell you what I have resolved to do —because, Uncle Walter, you are so very saving of my money; but you know `there is a time to spend as well as a time to save,' and surely the `time to spend' will never come to me with a more affecting appeal than at this moment.” “But, my dear child!” “Hear me out, uncle. I can, in no way, but by paying their price, shield this poor mother and her boy from the law that forces them back to slavery. I am glad, at any cost, to bear my testimony against it.” “But Grace, consider, my child—you can not afford to bear your testimony in this way. You have but just enough for your own wants; remember you are always a little in advance of your income. They may demand ?1,500 for the mother and child; Violet is a handsome creature, and beauty, you know, enhances the price of this kind of goods.” Her uncle's suggestion filled Grace's eyes with tears, and made her cheeks glow. “Oh, my country! my country!” she exclaimed, “how long are you to suffer this shame?” Grace's mind was imbued with an heroic love of country, a sentiment not common in these days of small and importunate egotisms. “Don't let us talk any more about it, Uncle Walter,” she resumed; “I must have my way this time. Eleanor is teaching me that there is more than one mode of securing independence.” “Do as you will, my child—do as you will. I verily believe you might persuade me to throw all the little money we both have into the dock, and go round the streets with you grinding a hand-organ. You and Eleanor will never catch the epidemic of the country—Thank God!” he added, devoulty. It was further on in the same evening when Miss Anne Carlton's maid was divesting her mistress of a dress (which her mother averred had been `admired beyond every thing,' at a small party where that lady had been the star of the evening) that mother and daughter were discussing Grace's sequestration of Violet. “Really, mamma,” said Miss Anne Carlton, “Grace imposes on you. I can not think what right she has to make our house a hiding-place for runaway slaves!” She caught the reflection of her handsome face in the glass, and interjected a sentence, seemingly foreign to the preceding, and in a quite different tone: “Do you know, mamma, that Sabina Reeve says she has not the smallest idea Copley means any thing by his devotion to Grace; she says it is a way he has of amusing himself.” “Time will show,” replied the non-committal mother. “But, about that slave-girl, mamma. Does Grace expect you to submit to the police searching our house for stolen goods? How perfectly horrid!” “Grace is trying!” said the mother. “But you know, Anne, I wish to avoid any difference with her, and I think I have managed pretty well so far—thanks to my knowledge of human nature.” One could not help wondering whether Mrs. Herbert was conscious of partaking this human nature, which she deemed so plastic in her hands! “I do particularly wish,” she continued, “to avoid involving myself in this inconvenient subject of slavery. No one disapproves of slavery in the abstract more than I do. I fear it is wrong; and I know enough of political economy to know that it is the most expensive mode of labor.” “Oh, mamma, do let political economy alone to-night.” “My dear! you are getting as nervous as Walter Herbert. He cut me short, just as I was beginning to give him my views. You may rest assured, Anne, that I do not approve of any interference with the laws. Women's duty is clear on that point. I am, therefore, not pleased with Grace's proceeding, and above all, with her bringing the runaway here. But you know I stand on delicate ground. Her father, by his will, gave her an absolute right to the apartments she occupies.” “Yes, and Mr. Herbert to his, and absurd it was!” “Dear Anne, do not speak disrespectfully of your mother's husband; few wills are made without some errors of judgment. But, to the point: so long as Miss Herbert keeps the girl in her own apartment, I shall not interfere. If the house is to be searched, I shall submit—with a protest.” “And so you would submit, if Grace Herbert turned us both out of doors. Some people always rule, and others always give up!” and the young lady, having concluded with this meek aphorism, retired with the conviction that she and her mother were among the down-trodden. The next morning every ring at Mrs. Herbert's door seemed to each member of her family to announce the dread visit of the officers of justice. They did not come, but at 12 o'clock there did come a pacquet, addressed to “Miss Herbert,” in Copley's hand. It contained “free papers” for Violet and her boy, with a receipt to Mr. Copley for ?1400, from the agent of Violet's owner. Copley's star was in the ascendant. He had stamped on Grace's feelings, at the moment of their softening, his own image, beaming with sympathy, generosity and benevolence. The unusually happy frame of Grace's mind was somewhat impaired by the receipt of the following curt answer to the note to her brother-in-law, in which she had communicated what she termed, “Mr. Copley's timely and kind intervention in his behalf:” “My Dear Sister:— “Accept my thanks for an offer, which of course I owe directly or indirectly to you. The appointment proposed neither comports with my sense of duty, my qualifications, or my inclinations. “Yours affectionately, F. Esterly. “P. S. Of course, you will make suitable acknowledgments to H. C.” “Very gracious! my dear brother-in-law,” thought Grace, as she refolded the letter, feeling an implication with her lover as an injured party, when she perceived that Eleanor had filled the inner pages of the sheet. “Ah, sweet sister,” thought she, “you will make all smooth—you were made to pick the thorns out of life.” “Don't set it down against Frank, dear sister,” said the letter, “that his answer is a little crusty. You know how these bilious attacks of his turn all sweet juices to acid for the time. The harassing trials attending his resignation, followed too close upon our boy's death, and quite knocked him up. It seems to me that the afflictions God appoints are sanctifying, while those of men's infliction stir up the evil in our nature.

Pray make the best of it to him. Give him my grateful acknowledgments; and, dear Grace, do let your friend know how much I felt his kindness to little Herbert. Apologize for my not writing a note to him. I have been so absorbed in nursing and cheering my husband, that I have neglected minor duties. “Dear sister, I did not know, till trial and, in some sort, disappointment, came, the full blessedness of the marriage tie. Not in the days of `young love,' not in our hours of ease, but now, when the strain of life has come, do we realize the worth of our bonds; storms and adverse winds prove the ship. May your marriage, dear sister, whenever it comes, be as happy as ours!” Grace paused, read over the last paragraph, smiled—sighed—and then finished the letter. “Pray, Grace, look in upon Cousin Effie, and see that she does not over-fatigue herself with little Nel. Tell dear old Di' we hope to be at home next week. My dearest love to Uncle Walter, and kind remembrance to Mrs. Herbert; and please tell Anne, that if I go to B. I will execute her commission with pleasure. E. E.” “Oh, dear, perfect sister!” exclaimed Grace, “your heart compasses sea and land—even takes in Anne Carlton! Well, there can be but one normal character in a family—and but one normal marriage!”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. —“beyond reach His children can not wander Of the sweep of his white raiment.” On the banks of the Hudson river, on one of the old roads not yet absorbed into a broad and numbered avenue, was a farm-house on a property called “Blossom Farm.” The house stood under a bluff overlooking the river and the Palisades. It was completely screened, winter and summer, by tall old pines. The road that ran between it and the river, scarcely more than a bridle path, was particularly attractive for horsemen who liked lonely and romantic rides. There, in a well-aired apartment of the house, bolstered by piles of pillows, lay a young woman in the last stage of consumption, as her emaciated frame, her hectic cheek, her glowing eye, her moist temples and her whistling breath too surely indicated. Her fair long tresses were turned off her face and lay over the pillow with that lifeless languor which marks even the hair in this disease. Her small transparent hands were tightly clasped, betraying the effort to which her spirit was strained. Her faithful little spaniel lay at her feet, looking up wistfully, moving at her slightest movement, and wagging his tail at every sound of her husky feeble voice— that voice lately so sweet and clear. Miss Travers stood behind her, dropping heavy tears on her pillow, and bathing her temples, while a middle-aged woman knelt beside her, her whole frame quivering with emotion, and her face crimsoned and convulsed with grief. “Why, in the world, my poor child,” she said (it was Jessie's mother), “did you not tell his mother? Did the villain buy your silence?” “No, mother. But when I felt what it was to be miserable—oh, most miserable—I could not bear to make another so—he was her only child.” “And you—you were mine! Oh God, rain down curses on him!” “Oh, mother, don't say that. You promised to be still and hear me. I can not speak if you say such words—don't, mother dear.” “I will try not, my darling,” said the poor woman eagerly, and she pressed her hand firmly over her mouth. “He sent me to the city,” resumed Jessie, “to a decent-looking place; he gave me plenty of money, and every way provided for me. Oh, how I lived on his promise to come and see me—he never came—I thank God now, but then I did not feel so. I saw only a woman and a servant that tended on me. I soon found out they were the worst of people.” “Oh, my innocent child!” “Hush, dear mother. I wrote again to you—was it that letter you got?” “It was, thank God.” “I can't remember how many weeks I was there, it seemed forever. I had cried till I had no more tears left; but I sobbed, and sobbed night and day, I had got so into the way of it. One horrid night the house seemed full; there was rioting, and drunkenness, and thundering knocks at my locked door. I was in such terror. The next day I stole away, and went to Miss Martha Young's. She was dead. Oh, when I found it so, I was so sick and faint. But, mother, God did not forsake me. A kind Irish woman took me into her own little room, and got such plenty of work for me, that I earned more than I spent. I made my baby-things; they were so pretty!” A smile gleamed over Jessie's face at this one pleasant memory. “I loved to look at them; I could not help it—I hope it was not wrong; I knew I was disgraced, but I did not feel wicked, mother. It seemed to me that my Father in heaven looked down on me in pity, not in anger. I had burned up the bank-notes Mr. Copley gave me. I had cast away all the fine things he decked me with. I had tried to do all the right I could, and I was patient and somehow at peace. It was last May my baby was born—the baby that I had so longed to hold in my arms! to feel its breath on my cheek, and its little lips on mine, but, oh mother, it was dead—it was dead! I never saw it!” The poor girl's voice here sank away and a shiver passed over her, but after an interval of ten minutes, and taking some restoratives, she was able again to speak. “It was better so, I suppose; I had on right to the sweet feelings of a mother. I was very, very ill, and that good soul staid from her day's work to nurse me. A cough came on, and I went down, down, down, month after month, worse and worse. About a month ago, it may be two, my mind began to wander, and one night, I think, I got up in my sleep—I don't know—it was all confused—” She rose in the bed, and rested on her elbow, and seemed piercing into the intricate obscurities of her memory, but it was in vain; she shook her head and sank back. “It seemed to me I met him—I can not say if I did. I can not separate what was real from what was a dream. My mind was so bewildered—could it have been a dream? I remember it all so well. The streets were still and empty, and I walked on and on—I was so tired. I looked up to the stars, and they looked cold and far away, and I tried to pray, and God seemed far away too. Then I heard footsteps—I stood under a lamp. Mr. Copley came close to me—he was walking with a tall lady. It could not have been a dream, and yet when I laid my hand on him, and stopped him, and spoke to him, he seemed not to know me—just as people do seem in a dream—and he shook me off, and I fell on the pavement, and then I don't remember any more till I waked in the hospital on Blackwell's Island. You know, dear Miss Travers, what that place is? It's the place, mother, where they send wretched women from wretched places. I was mistaken for one of them! Oh, dear! dear! dear!” “You, Jessie, my child! and you ask me not to curse him?” “You must not, mother. I am just gone, and I want to hear blessing and not cursing. Mother, say that blessed prayer with me I used to say at home, when I knelt down before you. I have prayed it many a time when it seemed to fold me round like wings and lift me above my sin and my sorrows. Pray it with me, dear mother, and you won't feel like cursing.” Mother and child repeated together that divine petition, whose few words expand to every want of humanity. The mother's voice was soft and steady. Jessie's such as one might imagine a spirit's to be, hovering at the opening gate of immortality. When it was finished, she drew her mother down to her bosom, gave her a long protracted kiss, and murmured, so low that Miss Travers bent her head to the pillow to hear her, “Now all my trouble is over, mother. God has forgiven us both. We shall meet in heaven.” She gasped for breath. Miss Travers gave her a cordial, and wiped away the cold dews on her forehead. After a little while her breath was less obstructed; nature roused its last energies, and she proceeded: “You want to know all, mother; there's not much more to tell. I was three weeks VOL. II. 2 in the hospital. Oh, what racking pains of body, and pangs of conscience, and far worse, what hardened wickedness I saw there! For the most part they were victims of vanity and love of dress. I thought good women should gather up friendless children, and teach weak ignorant girls what snares fine clothes and flattery may be to them. But God's witnesses were there too—a good doctor, and a kind matron; and there came there every week, a woman—one of God's messengers she surely was—she looks after all forsaken and forgotten ones—love and hope shone in her face. The sun broke on my black night when she took my hand and kissed me, and told me to be of good cheer. She it was that brought me to this quiet place, and brought Miss Travers to me.” All that we have here written down in continuous sentences, was broken into fragments by faintness, gasping, and sometimes utter loss of breath. Now her eye was becoming glazed, and her utterance so painful that Miss Travers said, “Don't try to speak any more, dear child, it is too hard.” “Only one word more—mother, say you forgive him.” “I do—I do forgive him—God forgive us all!” A heavenly smile lighted Jessie's face. “Just like the first smile I ever saw on my baby's lips!” exclaimed the mother. “Thanks,” whispered Jessie, her feeble hand groping for Miss Travers; “poor little Beau, good-bye—kiss me, mother—how dark it's getting! Good-night—good-night!” The low whisper ceased, the breathing became fainter and fainter. In one hour more Jessie's heart ceased to beat. Miss Travers sank on her knees in silent prayer. The mother seemed totally changed. God had spoken to the waves of resistance and resentment, “Peace—be still!” and they were still. She sat down on the bedside, and calmly putting aside the pillows, laid Jessie's head on her bosom, and folded her arms around her, saying in a subdued tone, “My own little girl in my arms again!” Here, in the deep shadows of obscurity, lay this victim of a man of the world, degraded—not corrupted—a beautiful flower ruthlessly crushed, God's gracious gifts thrown away, and the good purposes of his providence contravened. Here, her life taken away, her pure name blighted, never to be spoken, but with scorn or sighs; here she lay—dead—on the bosom of a broken-hearted mother! Where was he who was to answer for her fate? Lapped in luxury—seeking a fresh pleasure for every passing hour— received among “respectable men,” who knew his course of life, as if untainted, and—God help us!—by mothers as a fit associate, a coveted husband for their daughters, for he belonged to the “best society,” he was “high-bred,” and “very elegant,” and “so fascinating”—we quote, not invent the current phrases—and “he had thirty thousand a year!” This is the stale old world complaisance repeated here. Pass the threshold to another life—“A ministering angel shall my sister be when thou liest howling.”* HORACE COPLEY TO SAM BELSON. “Dear Sam, “I have been passing the evening alone with my mother. I do that dutiful act now and then. My mother is regularly pious, straight-laced, but she discreetly avoids meddling with my affairs. I fancied she had her suspicions after Jessie's sudden demise, but she said nothing—wise in her generation is my mother. `Apropos des bottes,' I met that girl Jessy in the street not long ago—she is shockingly changed—gone like the rest of them. She stopped me, and spoke to me, and who of all the world do you think was with me!—G. H. By Jupiter, Sam, I thought my game was up —but bless these fine young ladies!—bless their voluntary and involuntary blindness! To return to my tête-à-tête with my mother. After a preliminary fidgeting she began: `I have long wished, my son, to speak to you on an interesting subject. The town, you know, Horace, is giving you to Miss Herbert.' I bowed and looked, I'll answer for it, as blank as white paper. `I have no objection to make,' she continued (that is, revered mother, you will not oppose a will you can't control) `I must confess I should have preferred another selection. Your dear father in his life-time tried hard to purchase the beautiful Carlton property next ours, and when I think of what I know to have been his wish, of course it seems to me a pity that you do not prefer Miss Anne Carlton, who is quite as handsome and as superior as Miss Herbert, and more—(I wondered what my mother stumbled at), and more—docile—more like to make a pliant wife. But of course it is for you to decide—it is nothing to me in a worldly point of view.'—Humbug, Sam, she would give her right hand to see me married to Anne— and her `beautiful property.' `It is a trial,' she continued, `when an only son comes to marry; daughters-in-law are not daughters, but mothers are always mothers.' She wiped her eyes, perhaps tears from them, for it is a tremendous struggle to ungrapple her hopes from the Carlton estate. I assured my venerable parent that I felt deeply grateful for her generosity, but I only nibbled at the bait;—it is too soon to pour my confidence into the maternal bosom. The balances are still quivering. They shall not turn against me. I know, Sam, you think me a fool for this dogged pursuit, when, as you say, there are scores of pretty women—Anne Carltons—that I might marry for the asking, or, better still, have without the cost, and risks, and tedium of marriage; or, I may enjoy the swing of youth, you tell me, and at forty, fifty, or sixty buy a pretty young wife. Wives have their price in our pure young republic, and if not quite as cheap as in a Turkish market, they are as surely to be bought. But, my boy, I can not give up the chase now. Like other men, perhaps I `prize the thing ungained more than it is.' Six years since I made a bet with you and recorded it, that I would marry Grace Herbert. When I was a boy, if I set my wishes on a particular apple, on a particular tree, I would break my neck but I got it. My temper is not yet changed! “She cares not a fig for my fortune, or my position—this gratifies my pride; for, if she marries me, it will be for what I am, or what she fancies I am. Laugh at my vanity, if you will, I have it in common with the world; it is the universal motive-passion; it impels the florist to produce the prize rose, and leads the martyr to the stake; we are all on one level there. “I have made lucky hits of late. The Esterlys have lost one of their progeny, and while they were in the ferment of hopes and fears, I rained down toys and flowers upon them. Trifles light as air tell, when the heart is soft. I wrote a masterly note, and sent it, with a bouquet, to solace Miss H. when she came home from her nephew's funeral. It was non-committal, and yet significant enough. I could turn Augusta Tallis' head off her shoulders, with half the pains I took to compose that note. “But my master-stroke, my coup-de-grace, was this very morning. There has been a hue and cry after a mulatto runaway slave, a devilish fine creature, connected with an old family servant of the Esterlys. Miss H., as one might predicate of her, partakes the furor for fugitive slaves in general, and for this one she had a particular interest. I seized the occasion, and ransomed the woman and her boy, paying to the tune of ?1,400!! “I see but one breaker ahead—that cousin of mine, Julia Travers, saint and vestal; would she were trimming her own fires, instead of watching mine! Setting aside feminine decency, she had the boldness, not long ago, to speak to me of that little fille-de-joie, Jessie, who has turned up somewhere in Miss Julia's harvest-field, and `della qualle é bella il tacere,' and so I told my cousin in pretty plain English, and we parted—daggers drawn. “Rolla is at the door, I am going out for a gallop—au revoir—” “11, P.M.—I think it was the devil, or a spell like that which is said to bring a murderer back to the precise scene of his crime, that made me turn Rolla's head out of the avenue into an obscure road, which you may remember, where, on turning an angle by a copse of pines, you come upon an old farm-house. As I came round the corner, Rolla was in full headway. I saw a hearse standing before the farm-house door, and two or three officials about it. I think from a premonitory impulse to escape the place, I must have given a sudden jerk to Rolla's bit; he never before served me such a knave's trick—he stumbled, and threw me over his head; mine struck the ground. I was stunned, and taken into the farm-house unconscious. When I came to my senses, I was stretched on a sofa, and my cousin Julia was bathing my temples. My perceptions were dim, but I think there was another person beside my cousin in the room, for I have an impression of a ghostly pale face, and a long mourning veil floating through a door into a back-parlor, and of my cousin leaving my side to close the door. She gave me a glass of wine—her hand shook; so, I think, did mine. After a while she said, `Your color is returning—are you better?' “`Yes, quite well.' “`Your horse is at the door; are you able to remount him?' “Her voice was steady, and her manner not unkind. I can not tell why I was irritated. Are there unseen demons that beset us? I felt as if I were in a place of torment, and she there to scourge me. I replied, `Yes, perfectly able,' and threw from me a handkerchief steeped in some infernal stuff which she had laid on my forehead. As I rose to my feet—the room turned dark; I reeled, and caught by the first thing I could reach. The confusion passed like a driving cloud, and directly, with the full power and acuteness of my senses, I perceived that my hand had seized the open lid of a coffin, and under my eye was the face of that girl— Jessie. Good God! Her image, as she was a little more than a year ago, rose before me; the bloom and roundness; the rich and shining tresses that her little childish fingers played with, as in her confusion she parried my love-making; those bright dewy lips, now blue—blue, and cold—bah! they haunt me. I was weakened by my fall, and this shocking sight smote me: my nerves were shaken—my blood curdled at my heart. I should have been prepared for this sorry sight by the looks of the girl when I met her in the street, but I was not; I was unmanned. I paced up and down the room, and again I stood over the dead girl. Just at that moment the door opened, and in sprang another acquaintance of mine, Jessie's only friend, a little spaniel that had come with her from her English home; she called him Beau. I had fed and petted him; he flew up to me, fawned on me, and licked my hands. Sam, I confess it, I felt at the moment as if it would be sacrilege to touch him. He turned from me, and leaped to the coffin, and lay there as still as the clod within it. I was weak as a child. I wrung my hands—I cried like a boy! I saw a tear in the hollow of Jessie's cheek; I started, and looked to my cousin. `Her mother dropped it there,' she said. “`Her mother! Has she a mother?' I asked. “`Yes, a broken-hearted mother. Oh, Horace! who can say where a great wrong shall stop? Dear little Jessie's sorrows are ended. She forgave all, and I doubt not is forgiven. Do not let her dying prayer for you be lost! There is mercy for the sinner; though his sins be as scarlet, they shall become white as wool.' She went on multiplying trite quotations. Her exhortation was a thought too long; it brought me back to the old track. Had she left me to the scourging of that horrid sight—to the rebuke of that fond little animal, I might have passed by remorse to penitence, and perchance come out upon the highway of reformation, but I was not to be bridled and ridden by a canting girl, so I broke away, mounted Rolla, and came home. I swallowed a glass of brandy, and went to the opera, but I heard nothing but the ringing in my ears, saw nothing, but that coffin, and the wreck within it. I rushed into the street, and found myself before Miss Herbert's door. Miss Herbert heard me as I entered, and came into the hall to thank me for my part in the fugitive-slave affair. She sent a flood of healing from her starry eyes into my soul. When we came into the drawing-room, her step-mother—old women are always asking about one's health—remarked my paleness, and inquired if I were ill, and followed up her inquiry with an exclamation at a patch on my forehead which I believed my hair covered. I stammered, and finally confessed that my horse had thrown me. “`Your horse stumbled!' exclaimed old Herbert, who never lets an opportunity pass of annoying me; `I think I heard you boast that a horse well broken like your's never stumbled.' “`Rolla bowed to destiny, Uncle Walter,' said Grace; `pride must have its fall! But I hope you are not much hurt,' she added, turning on me a look full of earnest interest. Uncle Walter, Rolla, may go to the devil—that look pays all. Lisle was there. That old loafer, Walter Herbert, affects him greatly. I meet him hobbling along at the young man's side every day. I believe in my soul, the old fool would rather give his niece to him than to me! I am not jealous of him, Sam, but we are antagonistic. He looks at me with a cold contempt that irritates me. “Good-night—the clock strikes two—I am tired, out and out, but there is no sleep in me—phantoms haunt me. Twice I have rushed into the street, and walked round the square. I can not get beyond that coffin! that dead girl! I am not worse than other men, nor old, nor sick—why should these phantoms pursue me? Good-night. H. C.” The good man meditates and prays in the silent watches of the night, and “the peace that passeth understanding” takes possession of him. But to all, save the good, what are these “silent watches,” when nature with its thousand assuaging voices is stilled, when the clamors of the world are hushed, the flatteries of friends are forgotten, the officiousness of incessant vanity is subdued, and even the soothing whisperings of self-love have died away? Crimes, sorrows, levities—that which “has been done that ought not to have been done,” and “that which has been left undone”— haunt the memory. The soul is alone in the sun-light of truth, before the tribunal of conscience! before God! The veriest wretch of our city, unfed, unhoused, needed not to envy Horace Copley, the rich, the exquisite, the “fascinating” Horace Copley, during the silent watches of that night. No besieging general ever more anxiously calculated the 2* chances of success, and provided against intervening and opposing forces, than did Copley. The nearer he approached the hour of victory, the more eager and vigilant he became. He had now to manage his cousin Julia, and to that end he elaborately penned the following epistle: “My Dear Cousin Julia:— “After the melo-dramatic scene which we shared yesterday, I feel bound to make an appeal to you, not wholly to justify myself, but to state some extenuating circumstances. This is not a fitting subject to discuss with a young lady, but it is thrust upon me, and you must pardon me. A recurrence to the circumstances of my early life will perhaps distill from your kind heart some drops of pity for me. Remember, that I was left at nineteen, when the appetites are keenest, and the love of pleasure uncontrollable, heir of a large fortune, and master of myself. My father, it is too well known, had not been over-strict in his life. With his example, I inherited his constitution. Pardon me, Julia; you are a sensible woman, and will allow their due weight to the grounds of my defence. At nineteen, then, I began my career; I had intimates older than myself, who were deep in the world. I plunged in with them, and I have no great satisfaction in the retrospect of the two years that followed. “At that period, viz., when I was twenty-one, `a change came o'er the spirit of my dream'—the love of my childhood for Grace Herbert revived, with all the force of manhood, and from that hour, with more or less hope, I have loved and followed her. From that period I have been getting rid of my old companions, and habits, and, on my soul, they have now no charm for me, or influence over me. “`And yet,' you will say, `this poor girl's tragedy has been enacted within the last year!' True, my dear cousin, true! But I could not turn anchorite at once. Miss Herbert had been unusually cold to me; and disheartened, I shut myself up at Elm Grove. My mother brought this pretty young person there, and imprudently left us alone together. I can not enter into details to you; but, for heaven's sake, dear Julia, let by-gones be by-gones. Your imagination is naturally excited by the illness and death of this young person—God knows, no fault of mine—but look at the facts I have stated reasonably. I did all in my power to atone for my fault; I sent the girl to the care of a person in whom I had implicit confidence, and, as perhaps she told you, provided ample means for every exigency. “But, my dear cousin, as it is impossible we should view this subject quite in the same light, let me turn to another, on which we must have one judgment. I have but one chance for happiness, perhaps for virtue, for I am not stronger than other men, and disappointment might throw me back into the whirlpool which I have escaped by the force of a pure and constant passion. You know, by your own experience, the omnipotence of such a love. You will not assume the responsibility of depriving me of its motives and security? The future opens two paths to me—one of married love and honorable aspiration, the other, the `facilis descensus;' which I shall take, depends on you. “You love my mother? Her heart is garnered up in my unworthy self. With me alone rests the transmission of the husband's name whom she loved and honored, despite his faults—who, among poor mortals, has not faults? You would compass sea and land to save my life for my mother's sake; will you not do something to preserve that which is far dearer to her, the honor of my life? “I know you have a stern, permit me to say, a fanatical sense of duty, which might impel you to disclose this story of the poor girl, with your partly false impressions of it, to Miss Herbert. If you do, it is easy to foresee the effect upon her wounded pride, may I not add, her wounded affection? Dare you take this responsibility? I ask this question solemnly, my dear cousin, not in a spirit of defiance. Julia, when you kneel at the marriage altar, will it not be a bitter thought to you, that you have fenced me from it forever? for as true as there is a heaven above, I never again can entertain an honorable love. “You may imagine what is the force of feeling that overcomes my habitual reserve, and leads me to throw my open heart, quivering, at your feet—do not crush the life out of it. “May the God you so faithfully serve direct you! “Yours devotedly, H. C.” Miss Travers, with a deep conviction of her cousin's baseness, and a clear perception of her duty to her friend, had her hat and cloak on, with the purpose of going to Miss Herbert to make a full disclosure, when this letter was brought in. She read it through, at first simply with indignation at its false views and false assumptions. She read it a second time, and felt there was some truth, mingled with its subtle sophisms; a third time, and she shrunk from leveling a blow that must strike down her aunt; a fourth, and, throwing off her hat and cloak, she exclaimed aloud, “No, I dare not take this responsibility; perhaps it is by marrying my cousin that poor Grace is to work out his salvation and her own!” How few there are that comprehend the responsibility of declining a responsibility! Copley received a short, cold note from his cousin, promising secresy, and unfolding the letter he had written to Belson, he added this postscript: “I have Julia's promise of secresy, and the devil himself can't tempt her to break it! The game is won! Dear, sweet cousin Julia! you are just as consistent as the rest of the world—saints and sinners!” NOTE. If this sad story serve to expose a prevailing sin, let it have the full weight due to an “o'er true tale.” Its leading facts are true. Some of the most touching expressions were taken down from the lips of a dying girl, one of the many who are every year in our Christian city corrupted in their youth, and turned aside from the benign purposes of Providence, their fair field of life choked with poisonous weeds, and untimely driven to that bar, where, if mercy is meted to them, justice will be dealt to their destroyers. * See note at the end of this chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORACE COPLEY TO SAM BELSON. “Dear Sam, “I have been passing the evening alone with my mother. I do that dutiful act now and then. My mother is regularly pious, straight-laced, but she discreetly avoids meddling with my affairs. I fancied she had her suspicions after Jessie's sudden demise, but she said nothing—wise in her generation is my mother. `Apropos des bottes,' I met that girl Jessy in the street not long ago—she is shockingly changed—gone like the rest of them. She stopped me, and spoke to me, and who of all the world do you think was with me!—G. H. By Jupiter, Sam, I thought my game was up —but bless these fine young ladies!—bless their voluntary and involuntary blindness! To return to my tête-à-tête with my mother. After a preliminary fidgeting she began: `I have long wished, my son, to speak to you on an interesting subject. The town, you know, Horace, is giving you to Miss Herbert.' I bowed and looked, I'll answer for it, as blank as white paper. `I have no objection to make,' she continued (that is, revered mother, you will not oppose a will you can't control) `I must confess I should have preferred another selection. Your dear father in his life-time tried hard to purchase the beautiful Carlton property next ours, and when I think of what I know to have been his wish, of course it seems to me a pity that you do not prefer Miss Anne Carlton, who is quite as handsome and as superior as Miss Herbert, and more—(I wondered what my mother stumbled at), and more—docile—more like to make a pliant wife. But of course it is for you to decide—it is nothing to me in a worldly point of view.'—Humbug, Sam, she would give her right hand to see me married to Anne— and her `beautiful property.' `It is a trial,' she continued, `when an only son comes to marry; daughters-in-law are not daughters, but mothers are always mothers.' She wiped her eyes, perhaps tears from them, for it is a tremendous struggle to ungrapple her hopes from the Carlton estate. I assured my venerable parent that I felt deeply grateful for her generosity, but I only nibbled at the bait;—it is too soon to pour my confidence into the maternal bosom. The balances are still quivering. They shall not turn against me. I know, Sam, you think me a fool for this dogged pursuit, when, as you say, there are scores of pretty women—Anne Carltons—that I might marry for the asking, or, better still, have without the cost, and risks, and tedium of marriage; or, I may enjoy the swing of youth, you tell me, and at forty, fifty, or sixty buy a pretty young wife. Wives have their price in our pure young republic, and if not quite as cheap as in a Turkish market, they are as surely to be bought. But, my boy, I can not give up the chase now. Like other men, perhaps I `prize the thing ungained more than it is.' Six years since I made a bet with you and recorded it, that I would marry Grace Herbert. When I was a boy, if I set my wishes on a particular apple, on a particular tree, I would break my neck but I got it. My temper is not yet changed! “She cares not a fig for my fortune, or my position—this gratifies my pride; for, if she marries me, it will be for what I am, or what she fancies I am. Laugh at my vanity, if you will, I have it in common with the world; it is the universal motive-passion; it impels the florist to produce the prize rose, and leads the martyr to the stake; we are all on one level there. “I have made lucky hits of late. The Esterlys have lost one of their progeny, and while they were in the ferment of hopes and fears, I rained down toys and flowers upon them. Trifles light as air tell, when the heart is soft. I wrote a masterly note, and sent it, with a bouquet, to solace Miss H. when she came home from her nephew's funeral. It was non-committal, and yet significant enough. I could turn Augusta Tallis' head off her shoulders, with half the pains I took to compose that note. “But my master-stroke, my coup-de-grace, was this very morning. There has been a hue and cry after a mulatto runaway slave, a devilish fine creature, connected with an old family servant of the Esterlys. Miss H., as one might predicate of her, partakes the furor for fugitive slaves in general, and for this one she had a particular interest. I seized the occasion, and ransomed the woman and her boy, paying to the tune of ?1,400!! “I see but one breaker ahead—that cousin of mine, Julia Travers, saint and vestal; would she were trimming her own fires, instead of watching mine! Setting aside feminine decency, she had the boldness, not long ago, to speak to me of that little fille-de-joie, Jessie, who has turned up somewhere in Miss Julia's harvest-field, and `della qualle é bella il tacere,' and so I told my cousin in pretty plain English, and we parted—daggers drawn. “Rolla is at the door, I am going out for a gallop—au revoir—” “11, P.M.—I think it was the devil, or a spell like that which is said to bring a murderer back to the precise scene of his crime, that made me turn Rolla's head out of the avenue into an obscure road, which you may remember, where, on turning an angle by a copse of pines, you come upon an old farm-house. As I came round the corner, Rolla was in full headway. I saw a hearse standing before the farm-house door, and two or three officials about it. I think from a premonitory impulse to escape the place, I must have given a sudden jerk to Rolla's bit; he never before served me such a knave's trick—he stumbled, and threw me over his head; mine struck the ground. I was stunned, and taken into the farm-house unconscious. When I came to my senses, I was stretched on a sofa, and my cousin Julia was bathing my temples. My perceptions were dim, but I think there was another person beside my cousin in the room, for I have an impression of a ghostly pale face, and a long mourning veil floating through a door into a back-parlor, and of my cousin leaving my side to close the door. She gave me a glass of wine—her hand shook; so, I think, did mine. After a while she said, `Your color is returning—are you better?' “`Yes, quite well.' “`Your horse is at the door; are you able to remount him?' “Her voice was steady, and her manner not unkind. I can not tell why I was irritated. Are there unseen demons that beset us? I felt as if I were in a place of torment, and she there to scourge me.

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “Ye ken when folks are paired, Birdie! Ye ken when folks are paired; Life 's fair an foul and freakish weather, An light an lumbering loads thegither, Maun a' be shared.” The Esterlys, returned to their home, are at breakfast in the sunny room where all the home-breakfasts of their married life had been eaten. The beginning of each day has a flavor of youth. Each morning, as in Paradise, “heaven wakes with all his eyes;” and what happier scene do they fall upon than a family assembling in love, grateful for possible perils escaped, and speaking the “good-morning” in tones of affection, hope, and courage? Of all the family rites, the breakfast is the cheerfulest to the sound in body and mind—to the unsound, its sweet uses are turned to bitterness. Eleanor, owing to the pressure of family work, had tied the baby in a high chair at the table, and she, excited by the unwonted indulgence, was rattling tea-spoons and napkin-rings, and babbling her glee in a baby-patois, only intelligible to baby-lovers. “Why, I declare, what a pretty noise she makes, the darling!” said Cousin Effie; “she's telling a story, is n't she, all about the napkin-rings coming to see the tea-spoons? but Bob sings the loudest, don't he, baby?” Bob was the canary, whose cage was hung by the window, drawn down to admit the soft April air, and who, as is the nature of that genus, was excited by the social clatter to do his utmost at his noisy music. “Eleanor,” said her husband, in a querulous tone, “I trust you will find some place to stow away that bird out of hearing, when we get to Harlem.” “Why, papa!” exclaimed May, “Erby's bird!” The table was hushed, till good Cousin Effie said, in a healing voice, “Father forgot Erby.” “Did you forget Erby?” whispered May, as if her father should vindicate himself from ever forgetting the missing boy. But Esterly made no reply, unless the sudden direction of his moistened eye toward the canary might be one. In another moment the wretched bodily sensations triumphed, as they will in their hour of mastery, over affection, sentiment, every thing that belongs to the spiritual nature. “What is this villainous taste in this bread, Eleanor? You really should attend to my bread,” he said. “I am sorry you do not relish it, Frank,” replied his wife. “Relish it! Why it's a compound of acid and bitter. You that can eat Di's buckwheats, may talk about relishing! What are you laughing at, May?” “Why, papa, that's the very same loaf you said was so good last evening, at tea.” “No, May; that was Cristy's bread.” “No, papa; you are mistaken. Mamma came all the way back from Broadway, when she was going to Aunt Grace's, to tell Di' to put it aside for you.” “That may be; but it's not the same.” “I think it is, sir; mamma marked it with a cross.” May turned over the loaf, and, pointing to the cross, looked up to her father with a smile that would have driven out a legion of devils, having any other name than dyspepsia. Esterly made no answer, but putting aside his untasted tea, went off to his study. “Poor Frank! he always was so from a child,” said Cousin Effie; “he is always out of sorts when he is not well. Dear,” to Eleanor, “don't you think a little milk porridge, with just the least dash of lime-water, would help his stomach?” “No, thank you, Cousin Effie, he does not like messes.” “Oh he hates them, Cousin Effie,” said May. “Does he, dear? Men a'most always do—they are peculiar to nurse. But, may be he'll take a glass of cammomile with soda. I have given it to him many a time when he was of May's age.” `That possibly is partly the reason,' thought Eleanor, “why his bread tastes bitter now;” but, thanking Cousin Effie, she declined the prescription, saying she feared Frank's malady was now beyond a cammomile cure. The door-bell rang. “Go, my little waiter, and open the door,” said Eleanor to May; “Bridget is busy, and we must save old Di' all the steps we can.” Eleanor, on reducing her expenditures, had dismissed her man-servant. “You save every body but yourself, dear,” said Cousin Effie who, though accounted all through life “a dull little body,” had an instinct to perceive and feel a demonstration of humanity. May, charmed with her new office, came bouncing in with a note. It was from Mrs. Selby, the lady who had rented Eleanor's house and furniture. She was to take possession on Friday. It was now Wednesday morning. The note ran thus: “My Dear Mrs. Esterly:— “I came to town last evening, to be ready to take possession on Friday. I find it very uncomfortable at the Astor House with my children. If you can give me possession tomorrow, you will very much oblige me. As it is but one day in anticipation, and you move so little furniture, I imagine it can not much inconvenience you. Please return by bearer a favorable answer. “Yours with respect, S. S. “P.S. Mr. Selby and I are going to the opera to-morrow evening, and being a mother, you will feel how much more I shall enjoy myself if I leave my children in my own house instead of in a hotel.” Eleanor smiled at a selfishness so common in a world where one's own convenience is lead in one scale, and one's neighbor's a feather in the other. “What are you smiling at, dear?” asked Cousin Effie; “something pleasant in your note?” Eleanor told its purport—Cousin Effie caught but one idea from it “It would be awful,” she said, “if any thing should happen to those dear little children—hotels are so apt to catch fire!” Eleanor did not permit her amiability to degenerate into weakness, and she had taken her pen to write a laconic refusal, but at the suggestion of soft-hearted cousin Effie, she considered how she could put two days' work into one, and while she hesitated, her husband opened the door and said, “Eleanor, can you possibly copy that article for me?” “Oh yes, Frank; you know I asked you to let me do it.” The fate of Mrs. Selby's request was decided. Eleanor wrote a refusal, qualifying it with the offer of her spare room for the nurse and children. “Now I should never have thought of that!” exclaimed Cousin Effie; “'tis a great help to have a superior mind.” “A far greater to have a superior heart, Cousin Effie.” Eleanor's sweet look at Cousin Effie, as she said this, made it inevitable for the honest little woman to take the remark home, and she said with a blushing deprecation, “Well, I can feel, but I never know how to say or do any thing.” “Dear Cousin Effie, do you call it doing nothing to take my big baby off my hands till 12 o'clock?” “Oh, that's only what I love to do.” “And can do so well, Cousin Effie, that we shall never again know how to live without you.” “The dear little creater!” exclaimed Effie, as Eleanor went off to her task with alacrity, “who but she would ever think such a poor old body as I any thing but a burden? What a wife for poor Frank! She takes all the stumbling-stones and bramble-bushes out of every body's path!” “My mother?” asked May. While Cousin Effie was thinking how she should literalize her figurative language for May's comprehension—not seeing how very short the descent was from her own level to the child's—the door was opened, and Mr. Walter Herbert appeared. May leaped into his arms, and Cousin Effie, begging to be excused, withdrew. “Where is your mother, May?” asked Mr. Herbert. “Writing for my father, and she said she must not be called for any body—but you are some body, Uncle Walter, and I may call her for you.” “No, no, May—I am no body—and no one cares for me!” “Uncle Walter, I am sure I do, and my Aunt Grace does.” “Your Aunt Grace has other fish to fry.” “Aunt Grace fry fish! How funny you are, Uncle Walter.” Uncle Walter did not look “funny,” but pensive and abstracted. He was recoiling from dangers that now seemed to him close at hand. He had asked Grace to come to her sister's with him. She declined, pleading an engagement. During his solitary walk he had met her with Copley. May, with the instinct of a loving child, felt, without knowing wherefore, that he needed to be comforted. She put up her bright lips and kissed him, caressed his cheek, and said, “Ah, now, Uncle Walter, come and live with us in our nice little house at Harlem; if you and Aunt Grace come it will be jolly! Oh, it's such a pretty little house; not ugly old brick like this, but wood painted white; and not such big rooms as these, but the cunningest little rooms, just a little bigger than mamma's dressing-room. It's so much pleasanter, Cousin Effie says, not to have rooms cluttered up with furniture and things that we children must not touch—only a few things that we must have, you know, Uncle Walter.” “But my darling, people differ as to what they must have.” “Let them; you and I know, Uncle Walter, and mamma has all those things—a sofa for you to take a nap on when you are tired, and chairs, and a little table to sew by, and a big table to eat on. And we shall have one room entirely empty, where you, and I, and Grace can play blindfold, and not hurt ourselves, and break things. And there's a closet big enough for my baby-house, and a nice sunny kitchen, where poor old Di' won't get her rheumatisms, mamma says; and oh, best of all! there's a pear-tree in our yard where we can hang up Bob's cage; and ever—ever so much blue sky over us! Will you come with us, Uncle Walter?” The child's estimates of the necessaries of life were certainly very different from those of the world's in general— but, except ye become as one of these, ye can not enter into that kingdom of heaven which is in a heart of love and simplicity. Uncle Walter was responsive—May cheated him of his moodiness—and half an hour afterward Mrs. Herbert and Miss Carlton found him on the floor building castles with the child, with her blocks, and laughing with her over their downfall. “Good-morning, May,” said Mrs. Herbert. “Good-morning, ma'am—keep a building, Uncle Walter —mamma is very much engaged, ma'am, and so are Uncle Walter and I.” “Hoity toity miss!” said Anne Carlton, “where did you learn your manners?” “Pshaw, Anne!” said Mrs. Herbert, “children must be children. I heard at the door, my dear, that your mamma was engaged, but we came in to see the baby, and to take you home to pass the day.” “Is Aunt Grace at home?” “No.” “Then I'll stay here, if you please, ma'am, and I'll go and ask Cousin Effie to bring down baby.” “Oh, Mr. Herbert!” said Anne Carlton, as May ran off to the nursery, “how can you help spoil that child? She is the rudest little thing I ever saw.” “Not rude, Miss Anne; you know the old adage—`children and fools will speak the truth.'” “I know they will if they are not taught better,” said Miss Anne. Uncle Walter whistled. Now that whistle of Walter Herbert's was a commentary Mrs. Herbert never could bear in silence. “You don't understand Anne, brother,” she said; “she—” and she was going on to paraphrase all the truth out of Anne's remark, when, to Mr. Herbert's great relief, she was interrupted by the entrance of Cousin Effie and the baby. Cousin Effie, after making her rustic salutation to the ladies, was lost in the delight of showing off the baby in all the beauty and pride of babyhood as she was. She did not even see the splendid Brussels lace on Mrs. Herbert's new mantilla, nor if she had, would she have known it from the vulgarest net. She did not notice Miss Anne's beautiful French millinery. Effie was absorbed in displaying baby's sweet dimples, her curls, her mottled arms, her plump little hands, and her dear rosy neck; the baby jingled her coral bells, and crowed in response to Effie's crooning and May's screams of delight at her showing-off. Suddenly, by one of those impulses incident to babies, she dropped her coral bells, made a spring at Miss Anne, and clutched the roses in her bonnet. Anne shrieked, the baby screamed, and Effie, murmuring, “Dear little innocent creater!” and pressing her to her bosom, made her escape from the turmoil to the nursery. “Are they ruined, mamma?” asked Anne with a tragic vehemence. “Done for, Miss Anne,” interposed Walter Herbert, while the mother was mentally elaborating a paraphrase of the same fact. “An irreparable calamity, is it not?” “Yes, it is, Mr. Herbert, though I suppose you are laughing in your sleeve when you say so. I don't know what babies are born for.” “I sometimes wonder too, Miss Anne, when I see to what women they grow up.” “Come, come, dear Anne,” said her mother, “we are wasting time—(what else do the Anne Carltons ever do with time?)—brother, we are going round to see Horace Copley's house. Bandeli is doing the frescoes. The salon-à-manger is to be decorated after one in a celebrated villa on Como. You will like to see a place where you have a prospect of enjoying many a good dinner—do come, brother.” There was malice in the twinkle of Mrs. Herbert's eye as she said this. Uncle Walter replied gruffly, “Thank you—no!” “Oh, I am sure it will please you; the house is palatial; splendid drawing-rooms, a suite of private apartments for the master, another for the mistress—we'll suppose Grace, for so the world does say, now—a magnificent library, a billiard-room, a callisthenic apartment—in short, every thing that heart of man or woman can desire.” During this harangue Miss Carlton stood tapping the floor impatiently with her pretty French boot, and fidgeting with her faultless Paris gloves. “I have been twice over the house,” continued the incessant woman; “it's nearly perfect; but I could make one or two suggestions to the fortunate intended, Grace,” she concluded, casting a side-glance, half impertinent and half silly, at Mr. Herbert. “Don't make them, madam—don't speak to Grace—don't speak to me of that house, or any thing relating to it.” Uncle Walter's brow had been gathering the clouds that now burst. He could not help it. Mrs. Herbert retreated, and as the street door closed upon them, she said with a gasp, as if a bucket of water had been thrown in her face, “Brother Walter is dreadful to-day.” “Did you ever see such affectation?” exclaimed Anne; “as if he would not give his right hand to see Grace mistress of that house!” And Walter Herbert, left free to express what he felt, caught May in his arms, “You are right, my darling, you are right,” he said, “would we were all in that little white wooden house in Harlem!” May said nothing, but she understood Walter Herbert far better than those “world's women” did. She took out her little handkerchief and wiped the tears from his cheek, kissed him, and whispered, “I hate to see you cry, Uncle Walter; people that's old should not cry—don't.” “I won't, May, my little comforter, I won't.” He set the child down and went his way. It was near 12 o'clock when Esterly returned from a gallop to Harlem, whither Eleanor had sent him on some errands, as she said, to the new place, but mainly in the secret hope of refreshing her husband with a ride. How sweet and sure are nature's restoring agencies. He came in with a light quick step, heightened color, and brightened eye. “Eleanor!” he exclaimed in a voice cheerful and tender, “still slaving for me?” “Oh, no, Frank!” she said, holding up the manuscript, “I have just done my work: see if I have done it well.” He turned the leaves—“Perfectly; your hand-writing, Eleanor, is as clear as your head.” He fell on his knees, put his arm around her, and laid his head on his wife's bosom— “Eleanor, I was a brute this morning; no—not I, but my brutish nature mastered me, and it does so often, and I am then so querulous, cross, unreasonable, unchristian, even your sweet patience irritates me, my children's voices are discords, the world is one huge incubus oppressing me; then comes penitence bitter, but wholesome—and then, dear Nel, the flood-tide of love, sweeping out of my life every thing harsh and hurtful. Tell me, how is it, dear child, that you never get out of patience with me, never flout me, never, by any chance, speak a cross word to me.” “Perhaps you would not be flattered, Frank, if I told you the simple truth,” replied Eleanor, turning his waving locks from off his white temples, and smiling sweetly, as she looked in his face, beaming with tenderness. “The simple truth, my child? You can't speak any thing else.” “Well then, Frank, when you are out of humor, I feel just as I do when baby is cross with teething. It is her inevitable misery and my business to help her, to divert and soothe her as well as I can.” “That is not flattering to my manhood, Nelly,” said Esterly with a very dim smile. “The bargain was `simple truth,' not flattery, Frank, and it is as simple truth when I tell you that these little trials are mere exhalations from the ground, that melt away in the dear sunshine of our love; that you are my teacher, my master, my daily bread.” “Ma'am!” called out Bridget, hastily knocking at the door, and half opening it, “the carman is waiting.” The husband and wife started to their feet like lovers surprised at a tête-à-tête, and like lovers, as they were, they kissed and parted, each going with a lightened heart to the burdens of the day. With more of such Christian unions as that of the Esterlys, there would be fewer divorces for “incompatibility,” and a long lull to the stormy question of “women's rights.”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. “Let her here a shelter find, Shield the shorn lamb from the wind.” If our readers have not forgotten our humble little friend, Letty, they will be glad to know that if she had not conquered her love, she had mastered herself. No thought, bidden or unbidden, no vagrant fancy now blended her future with Lisle's. He had become her earthly providence, and she carried out, in a human relation, the extravagance of those fanatics who make self-annihilation a test of religious safety; who say one is only fit to be saved when one is willing to be lost. Letty's love for Archibald, and her desire to requite his generosity to her, produced a result that genius might have failed to attain. It was her hour of study at the piano, when she was startled by the nasal voice of a stranger, who, entering her parlor, said, “Miss Letty Alsop, I believe?” “Yes,” said Letty, rising, and setting a chair for the visitor; “do you wish to see Madam Steinberg?” “No; it's you I came to see, Letty. I call you Letty, for I always heard of you by that name.” One who has chanced to see the fluttering of a dove who, lighting in a poultry-yard, encounters a mature Shanghai hen, may imagine the relative appearance of the parties en scene. “I conclude you don't know me,” continued the Shanghai; “but I am the one you wrote letters to for your Aunt Lisle.” “Ah, you are—Miss—Clapp!” said Letty, stammering, VOL. II. 3 and blushing, as sundry recollections rushed upon her. Miss Adeline noticed the blush, and said, mentally, `I thought so.' For once she felt some difficulty in a direct approach to the matter in hand. Perhaps she was touched by the appealing tenderness of Letty's demeanor; an ox will not set its hoof upon a child. After looking about the room, as if taking an inventory of its furniture, “What a spruce little parlor,” she said; “I suppose you have a privilege in it, as you appeared to be playing when I came in—of course it's the family parlor, isn't it?” “No, Miss Clapp; it is my private sitting-room.” “Dear me! Oh, I see. You teach the young Steinbergs, and this is thrown into your salary.” It did not comport with Letty's Puritan habits of truth to connive at Miss Clapp's mistake. “No,” she said, “my salary does not include the parlor.” “Then, how do you afford it? rents are so up in the city.” Letty made no reply. She looked tormented. “I see,” continued Miss Clapp, “that you have feelings, Letty, and I don't mean to hurt them; but I must say, a young lady is in a precarious situation—I don't mean that exactly—but it's not prudent, for a young lady to live in lodgings that a young gentleman pays for; and there's no one living has a better right to advise you than I, if that is your case, and Archy Lisle is the man.” Letty gave way to inevitable tears. “I am sorry for you,” continued Miss Adeline; “I don't believe any harm of you, for you look as innocent as a lamb.” Letty did not just then feel lamb-like; a feeling of resistance rose in her gentle bosom. Miss Clapp was checked in her tramp into Letty's affairs, and, looking round for something to fill up the pause, she saw a portfolio on the table, with drawing utensils beside it, and putting her hand upon it, “Do you draw?” she asked. “Yes, a little,” replied Letty, rising to rescue the prey from the fowler. “Oh don't take it away,” said Miss Adeline, “I admire to look at drawings;” and forthwith opening the portfolio, she shook the contents upon the table; and before Letty, whose face reddened with more painful vexation than she ever in her life felt before, could gather them up she had snatched from among them a crayon sketch of Archibald reading by lamplight—as he did to Letty many an evening —with Steinberg's little grand-daughter leaning her elbow on the table, and gazing at him. It was a pretty and a faithful picture, and showed that love had not deserted the art it first inspired. Miss Adeline held it afar and near, on one side and on the other, and then broke out in a tone of utter amazement: “Did you do this Letty?” She probably heard Letty's faintly articulated “Yes,” for she proceeded, “It's much better done than any of the others! Why, I don't see but it is as well done as Cheeny's, and they say he makes men and women look like angels. Dear me! I always thought Archy handsome; but this is splendid! Why Cheeny gets two or three hundred dollars a piece for his. A bright thought! You can take likenesses—how much better for you than keeping on dependent. I have a lot of acquaintances, and I will make it a business to recommend you.” “Oh no, no, no, Miss Clapp,” said Letty, with more vehemence than she had ever spoken before; “don't recommend me—don't speak about me!” and taking the drawing from Miss Clapp, whose touch seemed to her to desecrate that which she had kept for the contemplation of her most private hours, she returned it to the portfolio; and having gathered up the scattered drawings, she laid it aside, as she would out of the reach of a mischievous child. She felt Miss Adeline's presence to be intolerable, and mustering courage, she said, looking at her watch, “You must excuse me, Miss Clapp—it is time for the children's lessons.” But Adeline Clapp was not to be repulsed by the tactics of civilized warfare. “Oh, my dear,” she said, “you must keep the young ones out for a while; I have not entered on business yet. I saw you had quick feelings, and I did not want to hurt them; but now I'll come to the point.” Letty sunk back into her chair, as if a dentist, with his instrument of torture, were approaching her. “To commence, then,” resumed Miss Adeline; “I think I can see as far into a millstone as any one, and I believe that you are correct, and that Archy Lisle is honorable.” This profession of faith indicated nothing to the artless girl, and she made no answer, though Miss Clapp paused apparently for one. She proceeded: “You know, Letty, the city is different from the country; there we know all about folks, here they know a little, and guess the rest; and when a young woman that's rather pretty, to say the least, carries a gold watch, and has a drawing-master, and the most expensive of music-masters, as I hear you have, and a private parlor, and a young gentleman visiting her for a constancy—why, people will talk.” “What do you mean, Miss Clapp? Talk about me! I do not know a human creature in this great, full city, but the Steinbergs and Mr. Lisle.” “My dear, what does that signify, so long as they know Mr. Lisle? Folks will talk—folks live by talking. Why, Letty, I heard a drawing-room full of ladies talking over the pros and cons about you and Archy, and I did not let on that I knew either of you.” “But you should, Miss Clapp,” said Letty, speaking now with a calmness that surprised herself, and a gentle dignity that, for a moment, awed Adeline Clapp. “You should have told them that I have no father, no mother, no brother or sister—but that Mr. Lisle is all of these to me; that he placed me here with good people, where I am earning my bread; and that all I have, beyond that, he gives me—masters and books, and my sitting-room, and my `gold watch!'” If Letty could be sarcastic, then her tremulous smile, as she uttered the last clause, was sarcastic; but it vanished as she added, with intense sadness, “And he has given me what I can never have again—his time.” “And his affection, perhaps you think?” said Miss Adeline, plunging her probe to the quick. “Yes,” replied Letty, with an heroic effort, “yes, as a dear brother gives it to a dear sister—so, and no otherwise.” “That's well—that's very well. But, child, I am older than you, and I must tell you it is not prudent to go on so; there's no telling when brotherly love may blow out into something higher-colored. You and Archy are running risks. He has given you all duty will let him, for Archy is —married.” “Married!” Letty covered her face with her hands. Whether it were white or red, whether it expressed mortification, disappointment, or misery, Adeline Clapp could not guess; in any case, she meant to speak soothingly. “I knew you would feel,” she said; “but it's always the way in our family, to bring things to a head. And so I repeat it— Archy is married. A Clapp's word is as good as a bond. What I tell you is truth, though not the whole truth—that will come out in time; the circumstances are peculiar. I leave you now to judge for yourself whether it is right for you to live on in your present style. Not but what I think it right that Archy should befriend you, and I am sure I am quite willing to bear half the expense—” Miss Adeline was stopped in her career by Letty's hands falling into her lap, and her head dropping on to her shoulder. Not one word had she heard since Miss Clapp's authoritative declaration that Archibald was married. Adeline Clapp roused the house with her outcries, and as she perceived Letty coming to life again under the tender ministrations of the Steinbergs, she took her leave, congratulating herself upon her wisdom in ascertaining the exact condition of affairs, and putting a bar to their further progress. Archibald Lisle now knew far more of the world in its good and bad aspects, and far more of the theory and the actuality of the world of sentiment, than when, in his youth, he unconsciously stole away poor Letty's heart. Without vanity, he was aware, that placed in the relationship she was to him, and restricted to his society, he might become the idol to her that a girl of loving heart will make to herself, and he conscientiously guarded against the danger by talking to her of her future career of teacher, by keeping the ultimate purpose of his liberalities steadily in view, and by selecting such books for reading to her as she might turn to account in her future occupation. We do not mean to intimate that Archibald was self-denying in his devotion to Letty. His evenings, at old Steinberg's, harmonized with his domestic tastes, in danger of starvation in a bachelor's boarding-house life with all its egotistic little comforts. The kindling of Letty's soft eye at his approach, her sweet cheerful satisfaction in his society, the caresses of the little Steinbergs, and their glee when like all lovers of children—childish as they—he showered toys and candies upon them, and an occasional gossip with the old people, all combined to diffuse a home atmosphere over Letty's little sitting-room, and to make it a balmy rest, after the dreary and weary bustle of every-day life. Lisle had now and then, at long intervals, spoken to Letty of Miss Herbert. He had mentioned meeting her, had quoted some brilliant remark of hers, or alluded to some interesting circumstance that bore a relation to her, and when he did so, there was a flash from his eye, and a quivering of his lip that never escaped Letty's observation. But strange as it may seem, this did not make her unhappy. She had settled it in her mind, that Miss Herbert was Archibald's fate, but when it was to be accomplished, had the indistinctness and mystery that death has to common minds—and so had her own future. It was neither near, nor afar off. So long as she satisfied her masters, did earnestly her duty to the little Steinbergs, and could pass half her evenings beside Archy, she lived in absolute content with the present. And could this have been her eternity, good little orthodox Puritan as she was, we fear she would not have changed it. But now had come the declaration from that relentless Miss Clapp that must be “the end-all.” And that there might be no misunderstanding, Miss Clapp followed up her interview with a note, as follows:—“Dear girl, I did not say quite all I wished, owing to your fainting which, I suppose, came from the heat of the room, and your surprise. I thought it my duty to tell you of a certain person's marriage, but as it is yet a secret, don't let it transpire, and don't allude to it to him. A. C.” Poor Letty! She could have plucked out her tongue easier than to have told it to another, or alluded to it to Archibald. All day she was restless, and in answer to the kind solicitude of the Steinbergs, she complained of head-ache, and head-ache and heart-ache she had. Margaretta Steinberg brought her in a basket of exquisite flowers, and a novel from Mr. Roberts, a lodger in Steinberg's house. This Mr. Roberts was head master of a noted Latin school. He had sought an introduction to Letty through the Steinbergs, and had lately been lavish in certain demonstrations, which her kind friends thought most auspicious omens of her future; and even the children interchanged whispers about “dear Letty's beau,” and smiled when they brought in his offerings. And Mr. Roberts might have had a fair chance of winning any sound heart, but not poor Letty's. The novel remained with uncut leaves on the table, and the costly flowers would have withered there, but for Margaretta's interposition. Letty, living out of the world, and having no data by which to calculate its chances, never, for a moment, doubted that Archibald was married to Miss Herbert, and all day her tormented brain was exercised in divining the reasons of the secresy—“Why Archy had not even had the kindness to hint it to her? and how in the world Adeline Clapp had found out what Archibald had meant to keep secret?” She sent away her drawing-master, she vainly tried to get through with her daily task with her pupils. Their report brought in Madam Steinberg, and she, alarmed by Letty's burning cheeks, and hot hands, sent her husband waddling round to Mr. Lisle's office to ask him to send a physician. But Steinberg not finding him there, or at his lodgings, the good old people, with German placidity, determined to defer medical aid, and in the mean time to administer, a homeopathic narcotic, not so innocent as it might have been, as the old lady, on paying her last visit to Letty's attic before going to bed, and finding her sleepless, trebled the dose. How blindly mortals work out Heaven's beneficent purposes! Dear old Madam Steinberg never forgot Letty's good-night to her, and often repeated it with streaming eyes, “Oh, how kind you are to me, Madam Steinberg,” she said—“to me, a stranger;” and then clasping her little hands, she added, “Seeing this, shall I not trust myself to him who pities me, even as a father pitieth his children—I do, I do!” The trust and the prayer were answered. Lisle had been walking till a late hour that evening, taking no note of time. Life seemed to him made up of disturbed and disturbing forces, all inharmonious. Letty in her artlessness, her gratitude to him, and her unworldliness, stood before him in something like reproachful contrast to Grace, who was being overcome by the world. Lisle felt, as he had never felt before, the fact of Letty's love. He felt an irrepressible gush of pity and tenderness for her—not love; no, that comes not for the bidding. He was approaching Canal-street, and turned into it, remembering, with some contrition, that a longer interval than usual had passed since he had seen her. He heard a cry of fire, and perceived it was in his direction. Still, so common an occurrence excited no alarm, till he perceived the outcries concentrating near Steinberg's. In a moment after, he saw the flames burst out from the old man's little wooden dwelling. In another instant he was there, and penetrating through the crowd, he met Steinberg, face to face, who, with a child in each arm, was screaming in German—so completely had he lost his head—“Letty's in the attic, save her!—the dear child!—mein Gott! mein Gott!” Lisle understood him—he knew the localities of the house. The fire had broken out in a crazy back-kitchen, and had made some progress when the sleepers in the front rooms were awakened by the smoke and crackling. “Bring a ladder!” cried Lisle, “there's a person in the attic that must be saved!” A ladder was brought, but intrepid as our firemen notoriously are, they recoiled from applying it. “Ther's no use,” cried one, “the flames are licking round the rafters—it can't be done.” Lisle sprang upon the ladder. “Come down, young man,” cried another. “You are lost,” shrieked a third, with a horrid oath, “you are lost, if you enter!—it's death— it's death, over and over.” Lisle paused on the topmost rung, but not to retreat. With characteristic presence of mind he took a silk scarf from his neck, put it over his face, 3* and secured it. With one thrust of his strong arm he demolished the frail window-sash, a dense column of smoke rushed outward, and Lisle disappeared. From below arose cries upon His name, who, if forgotten till human help fails, is surely then remembered. Breaths were suspended till, issuing from the blackness, and followed by the flames, Lisle reappeared bearing Letty, whom he had wrapped in a blanket, as if he carried but a child's weight. A general acclamation burst from the crowd; such a response as ever comes from man's soul to an heroic deed. Archibald, tearing the cover from his face that had saved him in his mortal strife with death, perceived that Letty was incapable of motion and unconscious. Plenty of hands came to his aid, and she was borne to the nearest safe house, and laid on a sofa. Restoratives were brought, and medical aid was sought and found. Her pulse beat feebly. Archibald knelt before her, and unconsciously kissed over and over the little hands he held in his, and felt the pulses, that had quickened at the faintest sound of his approaching footstep, grow feebler and feebler. “Spare your pains, friends,” said the physician with professional coolness, addressing the assistants who were lavishing restoratives; “it is all over with the poor girl. It is death by suffocation.” “It is not death; it can not be death!” cried Archibald; “Letty! Letty—dear Letty!” She answered not. “Oh, Letty—dear Letty! rouse yourself. Speak to me—to Archy!” There was a slight, a perceptible tremulousness of the eyelids, and the least possible movement of her lips to smile. It was the last vibration to the voice that had mastered the finest chords of her being—henceforward, still forever. The coarse, hard-handed men who stood around, bowed their heads. “Can we do any thing for you, sir?” said one and another in subdued voices. Lisle shook his head, and they slowly departed, one whispering, “I think he is her brother;” and another answering, “Something more, I think.” While the lady of the house went with her domestics to prepare an apartment for the exigency, Archibald was, as he desired, left alone with Letty. The first motion of his soul was a devout thanksgiving to the great Shepherd that he had taken this lamb away from the perils of life to his own inexhaustible love—that she had passed from the rough places of earth without dread or consciousness, to rest and peace eternal. And then, by that preternatural power which the memory has at such periods of exaltation, the passages of their past association passed in revision before him. Her loving, pleasant childhood in his father's house; her fond clingings to him in fancied dangers; her graceful little form playfully hidden by the vines of the old porch, springing to meet him with eager joy, when he came in from his field sports; the refinements that, as she grew older and more perceptive, she sprinkled over the homeliness of rustic life; the consolation of her filial devotion to his father, and her cheerful patience with the little fry at home. And, as if by a spell, came up the memory of thrilling tones, of words half spoken, of sudden blushes, and as sudden tears. These, passed by at the time as caprice or moodiness, were now revelations. And the last and dearest chapter of their joint lives, Letty's happiest days at old Steinberg's, her sweet contentment in his mere presence, her gratitude for even his smallest kindness, not conveyed in words made common by common thanks, but in floods of light that came beaming from her soul through her eyes, in smiles that are the spirit's language, in tones that breathe music into the simplest sentence. “Oh, I have been hard, unkind, unfeeling!” was the cry of his inmost soul. “I loved you, Letty—truly. But why have I wasted on another what should have been yours? Bitter, bitter, vain regrets! Now you are as far beyond my reach, as you were above my deservings.” Is it not ever thus? Is any, the happiest relation of life, severed without leaving us to lament over the imperfection of our love and its irremediable failures?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “Enfin sa bouche flétrie Ose prendre un noble accent.” There are tides in the affairs of men; tides so strong as to sweep every obstruction away and bear down every opposing force. Circumstances had of late been auspicious to Copley, and the object that for years he had pursued with unwavering determination, was within his grasp. The Esterlys had been out of the way. Little May, who had stood like the angel at the gate of Paradise, pointing a sword against him, was gone; and Uncle Walter, though the treasure of his life was at stake, became hopeless, and resigned himself to the common law of non-interference. Had Lisle, before this crisis, cast off the shackles of his reserve, risen above his self-distrust, and manifested to Grace his unconquered and unconquerable love, she might have responded to him, and risen by the force of her own upward tendencies out of sight of the subtle spell that Copley had addressed to her lower nature. But Lisle had now withdrawn wholly from her society, and though his love was not extinguished, it was buried deep in his heart and covered with the ashes of despair. Events are sometimes in such curious relation and proximity, that one does not wonder they have been referred to conjunctions of the stars. It was on the evening of Letty's death, that Grace, at twilight, was sitting alone at the bay-window of Mrs. Herbert's library, not gazing at the tints of parting day that smiled on the budding trees opposite, but taking an introspective view, where, just then, a soft and pleasing twilight pervaded too. She was endeavoring to overpower the still small voice that yet murmured against her lover, with such thoughts as, “how kind, how lavish he was to dear little Herbert;” “how generously forgiving of Frank's obstinate prejudice against him;” “how considerate of his interests;” “how prompt and noble for poor Violet's relief.” The door opened, and the ideal of her reverie glided in, approached her, and bent over her chair with a low and ardent expression of his joy in finding her, as he wished to find her, alone. He took her hand and pressed it to his lips. She did not withdraw it, and he saw in her beaming face a happy augury. The words, and the more expressive silence, the emotions, and the demonstrations that made the two hours that followed an epoch in the lives of both can not be told—must not be told, for the time was sure to come when Grace would wish all memory and record of them effaced. How many hours of life glide away colorless and unnoted; and how vitalized two hours may be; how bright! shedding a soft lustre over the past, and illuminating the future and illimitable! What swift movement have they, and yet what anchorage and sweet rest! What outpouring of hearts, what telling of their histories, what solving of their mysteries! Such were not Grace's; not even then, in those two happiest hours of all her intercourse with Copley, was there the beatitude of a true love. But they ended as such hours do, with promises, and plighted vows, and with some earthly regards and arrangements. Copley had business which would take him South for a few days, and it was therefore agreed that their engagement should not be announced till he returned. In the mean time Walter Herbert was first to be told; a note was to be written to Eleanor (a cold tremor seized Grace at the thought of these duties) and the fact, as in courtesy due, was to be imparted to Mrs. Herbert and her daughter. Copley was just transferring from his own finger to Grace's a diamond ring, to be the symbol of betrothal; her hand rested impassive in his, while he poured a torrent of tears over it (whence came they? had he a good angel? and was he then possessed by it? were questions Grace often afterward asked herself), when, at the sound of a footstep in the entry, approaching, he dropped it, and shot off into an alcove at the end of the room, where he stood in shadow. “My!” exclaimed the most unwelcome intruder. “I am so glad, Grace Herbert, to find you at home and disengaged; I seldom have that good luck with you. Dear me! is that you, Mr. Copley? Oh—ah—I might have known; but there being no light here—well, moonlight is pleasantest for some occasions that shall be nameless. Oh, how well I remember one moonlight night! Well now I hope I don't intrude,” continued Miss Clapp—it could be no other than Miss Adeline Clapp—lowering her voice to Grace; “I dare say I have broken up a tête-à-tête again. I have not been to Mrs. Tallis' since her reception till this morning, and I found Mr. Copley tête-à-tête there; odd, is n't it?” The obscurity of the room, and the imperceptiveness of Miss Clapp, favored all parties. She did not see the look Copley darted at her, nor did Grace perceive his sudden paleness, nor betray her own mounting color. On went Adeline Clapp: “Mrs. Tallis looked uncommon handsome this morning; she had on the loveliest silk, just the color of a dove's wing, Paris made, sleeves entire new cut. I asked her for the pattern, and if she remembers to give it to me, I'll send it to you, if you wish, Grace.” “Thank you.” Miss Clapp proceeded: “What a kind of a superstitious look Mrs. Tallis' little girl has. She'll not be long spared! How she did run on this morning, Mr. Copley. I guess Mrs. Tallis felt something she said to be rather searching— don't you, Mr. Copley?” “I do not remember a word she said,” replied Copley. “Why, don't you? how odd. Don't you remember she asked her mother `how long her papa would be gone?' and when her mother told her a month, `I wish it were a month now,' said she, and the tears ran down her pretty cheeks, and her mother kissed her—she does love that child; and then—why it's strange you did not observe—she looked up in her mother's face, and says she, `Mamma, do you love papa?' `Run up to the nursery, my dear,' says the mother, and she went just like a little lamb. But my! I wonder you did not hear her say, as she stood with her little hand on the door, `I never send you away, mamma—I hate the nursery, and I hate Mr. Copley.' Her mother got up and kissed her, and checked her. I'm sure she spoke loud enough for you to hear her, Mr. Copley.” Copley deigned no reply, and Miss Adeline at last perceived that her persistent monologue met with but an ungracious reception; but nothing ever disturbed her equilibrium, and she wound up with saying, “I feel as if it was but friendly to you, Miss Grace, and to Mr. Copley, too, to tell you that I surmise even that poor little child has heard that people talk about you and her mamma, Mr. Copley; and that is the make of people—they will keep on talking when a gentleman pays, well, rather particular attention to a married lady, visiting her every day, as it were, when her husband is off on a journey.” “Madam!” said Copley, with so fierce an expression that even Miss Adeline started, and exclaimed, “Gracious me! Mr. Copley, I did not mean to touch your feelings. I admire to see gentlemen polite to married ladies; and if you arn't sensible of any imprudence, there's no harm done by just my speaking between us three.” Copley had quite recovered himself, and, taking up his hat, he replied with his usual coolness, “Much impertinence, madam, but no possible harm;” and then, murmuring a few sentences to Grace, too low for Miss Clapp's greedy ear, he took his leave. “Miss Clapp,” said Grace, rising, “you must excuse me, I—I—” “Oh now, Grace, I can't excuse you. Miss Carlton told me you had no engagement this evening. I have been waiting ever since Eleanor's boy sickened to speak to you, or to her. It seemed more suitable to consult with a married lady; but she is always engaged, or out of town, or something. It's about Archy; and you and she are friends to us both. Now do listen to me.” Grace had risen, and was quivering with impatience to get out of Miss Adeline's grasp, but Archibald Lisle's complication with the insatiable woman turned the tide, and she reseated herself with resignation. “It's a pretty long story,” began Miss Adeline; “but then, Grace, I know you'll have a fellow-feeling, when we get into it. But it's so dark here, won't you have lights?” Grace rang the bell. The servant lighted the gas. “My goodness, how pale you look!” exclaimed Miss Adeline, staring at Grace, as the light flashed on her face, and for a moment she was awed, without comprehending the height and depth of feeling it expressed. But a glimpse into heaven would not long have checked Miss Adeline's tongue in its communication of her self-centered interests. “I am sure,” she resumed, “you'll approve of my feelings —there can't be two opinions about it—as brother says, it's only a question of time. Well, to commence at the commencement. Archy and my brother Dates were classmates in college. Archy was first-rate then, as he is now, and Dates was sort o' behindhand at mathematics and those kind of studies; and father hired Archy to give him extra lessons which Archy did, at a pretty handsome price—you know Archy's folks were rather poor, but we did not feel any difference on that account. I hope all the Clapps are too noble for that. Archy was invited down to Clapp Bank, to celebrate his birth-day. He had paid me considerable attention before that; and though he had not a dollar but what he earned, and his father was a mechanic, and my father had been a wholesale shoe-merchant, and had gone out of business with a handsome fortune—though nothing to compare with what we have now, with the rise of real estate, and factory-stock, and so forth—” “Oh, do come to the point, Miss Clapp.” “Well, I am close upon it. I was just going to say that none of our folks would have made any objection if Archy had delicate views; though father had been a member of the Legislature for five years, and Uncle Medad was in Congress; they felt I would have selected Archy before any other young man I knew. Well, that evening we had a first-rate time. It was moonlight, and the young men took the girls a rowing on the lake. Archy took me, and then we played plays, and had forfeits; and Anne Jane Evans adjudged Archy and I to go through the marriage ceremony to redeem our forfeits. Pa was in his study with Judge Eastly, and the judge went through the whole ceremony of the Church of England service with us. I can't say I looked upon it then as any thing more than a kind of forerunner. Well, after commencement, Dates went off to China, and Archy studied law, and went into practice, and never came to Clappville again. Well, you know how it is, Grace; when one is attached, and is, as Dates says, expecting `relations of reciprocity,' one don't give up the ship for a trifle. Well, you know Archy made the tower of Europe, and while he was gone, I did for his family just as if I were daughter and sister. Well, last fall, Judge Eastly was down at Clappville, and talking over old times with Dates and me, and so, says he, `Take care, Adeline,' says he, `that that chap of a New York lawyer don't claim you for his wife when he comes home.' I asked the judge his meaning, and he said he referred to the marriage ceremony, and he said there had been two just parallel cases in Massachusetts that bound the parties. The first lawyers had been consulted, and they gave it as their opinion, that it was `a legal and binding contract.' These were the judge's words.” Grace's interest was now thoroughly excited. “Good heaven,” she exclaimed, “you do not mean—” “Hear me through, Grace Herbert. I don't mean any thing but what is fair and above board. Well, I won't repeat all that the judge and Dates said. The judge thought that with my large fortune in hand, for by this time, you know, pa was deceased, and the estate settled; the judge thought that Archibald, knowing the points of the law, would claim me, whether or no. Well, Dates was ambitious for me, and he thought Archy was not quite up to my mark, and wanted me to keep it hushed up. I did not say much, but I had my own feelings. It's true, I did not know Archy's views, but knowing he would have the best of the bargain, I did not hesitate. I knew the day he landed. I laid all my plans, straight-work, as you would mark out a quilt. Matrimony is a solemn duty; and to be sure, I own I had entered on it rather lightly, but not without feeling—perhaps it was the same with Archy. I meant to behave honorably, and give him opportunities of falling in love, before we took up the stiches; and so I told Dates; and have written him the same since I came to New York.” Miss Adeline paused, and Grace's face expressing, even to her dull perceptions, something of the mingled wonder and disgust she felt, “I see,” she resumed, “that you don't quite feel with me. Perhaps you think it would have been more prudent for me to have told him at once that we were as good as man and wife?” “Oh, no—no, no, Miss Clapp, never tell him that.” “Never! why, we are; and can't you see it must not run on as it is now. He takes no hints, and he's all the while paying attention to the girl Letty Alsop—at old Steinberg's. I have found out who she is; it is not prudent, as regards her, and if Archy has really forgotten all about that evening, as he pretends to, don't you think it's quite time he was reminded? Now that's just the question I came to ask you.” Grace had not heard this long story without arriving at the conviction, that Archibald Lisle had entangled himself with this inevitable woman. “What is to be done?” thought she, rapidly reviewing in her own mind Adeline Clapp's story; “that noble fellow must not be caught by this `mousing owl,' but what can I do for him?—nothing. It is not a matter for a third person's meddling. Archibald Lisle will be the best manager of his own affairs, and the sooner he gets out of the web this horrid woman has spun about him the better.” And so, with effort suppressing a smile, she said, “Miss Clapp, I see but one course for you to pursue, that is, to make known at once to Mr. Lisle what your brother calls your `relations of reciprocity.' He will, as he chooses, confirm or dissolve them at once—good-night.” “She might have had the politeness to wait till I got out of the door,” said Miss Adeline, as Grace fleetly vanished up the stair-case. “`Dissolve them, indeed'—that he can't do; and dissolve five thousand five hundred a year—it's all at seven per cent. —that he won't do; but I kind o' dread to throw open the blinds at once; what is the use of asking advice?” Some of our readers may recoil with as much displeasure from Grace's betrothal as she felt disgust at the presumption of Miss Clapp's expectations, for there are those who in spite of the discordant matches of every day, will as freshly wonder at every new one as the child, who on looking at an old man with a young wife, exclaimed, “What a poor two you make!” Not that the world, in general, by which comprehensive phrase is designated the particular circle in which Miss Herbert moved, would feel any thing other than perhaps a momentary sensation at her rare good fortune. The general feeling in relation to any woman being, that she is better off in port than afloat. But there may be some, who comprehending the nobility of Grace's nature, will feel a keen disappointment at this crisis of her fate, having believed that though uncontrolled, unguided, unwarned, she would, in Ida Roorbach's phrase, “have worked out her own salvation,” and not have yielded at last to extraneous influences. She had clung to her distasteful home with the one dear compensation of her Uncle Walter's presence, though solicited by the advantageous parties, enumerated by Mr. Herbert to Lisle, and others quite as advantageous, unknown to him. She was now the victim of an illusion, an illusion to which an imaginative unoccupied young women, cast into a state of society with which she has few sympathies, is most miserably exposed. Letter-writing was not Copley's speciality, but he wrote, each day of his short absence, sincerely, and therefore earnestly. He spoke of the future as a fait accompli. Grace passed carelessly over his request that the finishing up, and decorations of his house, should be controlled by her judgment and taste, who “was soon to be its adored mistress;” and over his exultation in cheating the town of its gossip— though with this she rather sympathized, to dwell on his professions of ardent love, his impatience to return and bask in the summer of her kindness, after the “polar winter he had endured,” and like phrases, common coin in common circulation. Grace took them at their current value. The happiness of being loved is next to that of loving, and perhaps she felt that the perfection of the one made up for the still haunting consciousness of the imperfection of the other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TAPESTRY. It was a significant circumstance that Grace did not communicate to one of her friends, not even to her dear Uncle Walter, her engagement by word of mouth. Was it that she instinctively avoided the truth that flashes from the face before the soul is shrouded in plastic words and conventional phrases? Copley had recently gained in Mr. Herbert's good opinion. He had even, on one or two occasions, eagerly praised him in Grace's hearing, but the sigh, with which he ended, indicated but too truly an ineradicable disapprobation of the man. There was a singular sympathy between the old man and the young woman; an understanding and correspondence that did not need the intervention of words. And Uncle Walter was a man of few words, especially on those occasions when ordinary men are diffuse. The more intense the heat, the less crackling was there. Grace met Mr. Herbert, for the first time after her brief written announcement to him of her engagement, the next morning at breakfast. He was a very late riser, and she was accustomed to give him his breakfast. It was their hour of privilege and security, Mrs. Carlton being then in the field, laying out the momentous duties of her productive life. Grace met her uncle with her usual dutiful salutation, and took her seat. Both parties were silent. That was no unusual circumstance, for there was that perfect love between them that casteth out fear and restraint of all sorts. They were sometimes silent through the whole meal, and sometimes merry as children. Grace poured out a cup of coffee; Mr. Herbert took it, but their eyes did not meet. The servant brought in his hot toast and egg and placed them by him. He touched neither, but sat for a few moments, looking out of the window as far away from poor Grace as possible, and then seizing a morning paper he turned over its mammoth pages; it would not do; his blinded eyes could not see the words, and the rustling only sharpened the silence. He threw it down, rose from his seat, and was running away like a child from what he had not courage to face. Uncle Walter was a child. Grace sprang to him, and throwing her arms around him, and bursting into tears, said, “You must not go so, dear Uncle Walter. Speak one word to me, won't you? can't you? Well, then, I will undo, unsay it all!” “Oh, no, no!” he cried, his heart at last finding vent in words; “no, you have done it, my child, my all; I am foolish, Grace—I am old—God forgive me! God bless you!” And then gently disengaging her arms, he seated her on the sofa, and left her sobbing there; and taking his hat and cane, he left the room and hobbled through the long entry from the breakfast-room to the outer door, then returned, and half opening the door, in a sort of choking between laughing and crying, “Mind, Grace,” he said, “you give me notice to quit in time. I'll set up my rest with Eleanor and May; I'll not stay in this house after the only live person in it leaves it.” “Engaged! let me see her note,” cried Anne Carlton to her mother, who had summoned her daughter to her room to receive the news. She read Grace's missive. It was a short reading, merely a respectful announcement of her engagement and an injunction to present secresy. “Secresy!” exclaimed Miss Anne, “I wonder who will care to tell the news—men are shameful! It was only last Thursday, at Mrs. Smith's, that Horace Copley said such things to me, and looked more than he said.” “My dear!” “Oh, ma'am, you need not undertake to convince me that he did not mean any thing—I know him. What's become of your study of human nature, ma'am? You've missed in your lesson this time.” “My dear!” “Well, it's too provoking. I should have accepted Edmund Fay or Guy Clayton if you had not harped upon what you called a `wavering scale,' and such nonsense.” “My dear Anne, you are not respectful. One can not always clearly discern the future.” “Oh, I know. But you are always in a fog, and you always think you have nothing to do but heave your lead— human nature! that's a riddle you can't read, ma'am!” (After a pause,) “I never heard him admire any thing in Grace but her aristocratic air. And she and her uncle profess to look down upon fashion, and fortune, and the world, and so on. I never believed them. Who is a man of the world, if Copley is not? So dreadfully shocked they were at our asking Belson and Count de Salle. They and Copley are birds of a feather.” “Not quite, my dear. Not that I defend Brother Walter or Grace, for criticizing us; they knew I did not approve of intimacies with those men, nor would I exclude them from large parties, because they are not just what they should be—`judge not,' etc.” “Oh, mamma, what is the use of talking so? Every body knows what Sam Belson is, and you know besides.” VOL. II. 4 “My dear, there is a difference between Belson and Copley. Belson lives by—I don't know what, possibly gambling; he does not respect public opinion; he—in short, he lives freely; whereas Copley is prudent as regards public opinion; he has immense wealth, and does not waste it. Of late I hear nothing against him; on the contrary, I am told he has been confirmed, and you know he has a class in our Sunday-school.” “All humbug, mamma—every bit of it humbug; all to throw dust in people's eyes. Confirmed, indeed! Confirmed on Sunday, and fooling with Mrs. Tallis every day in the week. How easy old folks are humbugged.” Mrs. Herbert was on the verge of irritation,—she never went over. “I must confess I do not like this levity, Anne,” she said; “and if you really have so low an opinion of Mr. Copley, I own I do not see why you are not willing to give him up to Grace.” “Oh, low opinion; I have no such thing. I look upon Horace Copley as the very first match in New York. I am not in love with him. If he should marry any one else, I should not hang myself; but to have Grace Herbert the one taken, and I to be the one left! Besides, I never professed to be particular. I am willing a man should amuse himself the way he likes best. One thing please give me credit for, mamma—I never was humbugged by Grace.” So far as entertaining a blind faith in human virtue is humbug, Anne Carlton may claim complete exemption from it. “What do you mean, my child?” asked Mrs. Herbert. “Why, I always said that Grace was contriving and working for this prize, and would go through fire and water to attain it. Now tell me, mamma—you understand human nature, you know—would any girl in Grace's position pass by the opportunities she has had, unless for an ulterior object? Think of a girl, without fortune, rejecting the Honorable Mr. Grey, of a noble English family, possessing every thing that Grace professes to admire. Tut, tut, mamma; it is not so easy to throw dust in my eyes. Grace is getting on—she is two-and-twenty, and past.” She paused, and then added, “When is the wedding coming off?” “That I don't know; probably soon—there is no reason for delay. But, my dear, I do hope you will put the best face on the matter, and congratulate Grace. I should be mortified to have her suspect you of envying her good fortune; indeed we ought always to rejoice with them that rejoice.” “Never fear, ma'am—I can play my own cards.” Anne was leaving the room, and turning back, “`It's an ill wind that blows no good!'” she said, with beaming satisfaction. “We shall have a clear riddance of old Walter Herbert now.” “Don't speak in that way, Anne; you know I have endeavored to do my duty, and make a happy home for my husband's brother—but I have thought of that.” The “well-laid schemes of mice and men” are disconcerted, and so were Mrs. Herbert's; but before evening the oil had flowed over the ruffled waves, and she had reverted to her usual dead calm, and was harassing Walter Herbert with her eternal common-places. “If,” she said, “as would appear now, Mr. Copley has been long decided on this final step, he has shown remarkable constancy of purpose, and that is indicative of stability. Don't you think so, brother?” “Yes—and a pretty stiff will, too.” “True, brother. But Göethe, you know, says the `educated will makes the perfect character;' not that I mean to say that Horace Copley is perfect. Who is? It is incident to humanity to be imperfect. We do not expect young men of fortune to be immaculate; he is not. But there is nothing that is so calculated to restore a young man to a right course, and keep him in it, as a union with a superior woman. A superior woman's influence is unbounded. Love founded on reason, a deep, fixed love, is—is—” “A head of steam, no doubt,” interrupted Walter Herbert, who had never before listened so long to his sister-in-law's congeries of aphorisms; “but if you please, madam, let us talk no more about it. I thank God it is as well as it is!” “As well!” echoed Mrs. Herbert, with spontaneous amazement; “are you not satisfied, brother?” Mr. Herbert threw his half-smoked cigar in the fire, and without any other answer than a short “good-night,” he left the lady to speculate upon the insatiable demands of a doting old uncle, and upon other multifarious stumbling-blocks in her favorite study of human nature. It was Mrs. Tallis' habit to give the twilight hour to her child. On the memorable evening of Grace's betrothal, Elise had lingered longer, and clung closer than usual. Her mother had a sweet voice, and sang old ballads enchanting to the child. She was broken off in the midst of one by a servant bringing in a twisted note, written on a scrap of paper, in pencil, which Copley left as he passed homeward from his betrothal. His eyes were hardly yet dried from the tears he poured over Grace's hand; his hand was still warm with the pressure of her's! “Dear A.,” said the note, “I am engaged to G. H.!!! I shall be here between nine and ten—and am now, and then, and always yours devotedly, H. C.” There were but two lines, but Mrs. Tallis remained standing at the window and reading them, over and over, till her little girl, who had been repeating her entreaties for five minutes, that she would come back and finish her “story song,” said, taking her mother's hand in both her's, “Come, do come, mamma—I've got a very great pain in my head, and when you sing I don't feel it.” The mother answered rather instinctively to the magic touch of the little hands than apprehending the words, and again sat down, with the child on her lap, who, laying her head on her mother's bosom, and her hand on her head, said, “It feels better now, mamma—now sing.” But instead of singing, Mrs. Tallis turned the note to the mouldering April fire, and, as if yet incredulous, read it over again. The child snatched it and threw it in the grate, and then, frightened at its own impatience, she burst into a fit of crying. She was of a most quiet temperament, and usually as docile as a dove. The mother's thoughts were for a moment recalled to the child. “Why, what ails you, Elise?” she said; “what is the meaning of this?” “Oh, I don't know, mamma, what does ail me—my head feels so—and I could not bear the sight of Mr. Copley's old note.” “Mr. Copley's note! How did you know it was Mr. Copley's note?” “Why, John said so, when he brought it to you, mamma. I hate his notes, and I hate his presents.” “What, the beautiful presents he sends you?” “Yes, I do; and I don't love him a morsel, and I wish you did not, mamma—I wish you loved papa.” There was a moment's lull, and then the child resumed: “Mamma, do some ladies love husbands?” “Some do, I believe,” replied the mother, with a faint smile. “But you don't, mamma?” “I do not! Who told you so, Elise?” “Nobody told me, mamma—I can tell myself. You love me, mamma; if I am gone out, ever so little way, when I come home you are so glad to see me, and when papa came home from ever so far off, you were not glad to see him; and you always speak kind to me, and you never speak kind to papa.” “Hush, Elise—you talk too much.” “Well, I will hush, mamma, if you will just sing me out that pretty story.” The mother resumed the singing, but her voice soon died away; and when the child again urged her to go on, she said, “I can not sing to-night, Elise. You must go to bed, my child.” She rang for the nurse. The little girl held fast to her, clung most fondly, and when forced away, she said, “Do, mamma, come up and sing me to sleep, my head does really hurt me—horridly—will you, mamma?” “Yes, yes, I will, you little make-believe.” But, alas! alas! the mother forgot her promise, and that night, for the first time in Elise' life, Mrs. Tallis went to her own bed, without going to her child's little couch. Children are God's messengers. Woe to the mother whom they do not persuade to rectitude! On this same memorable evening, Eleanor read, and gave the following note to her husband. “Dear Eleanor:— “You will not be surprised to hear that H. C. and I have come to the end of our long and intricate journey. Shall we have a glad welcome from you, and a blessing from my brother? G. H.” Esterly glanced his eye over it. “Of course,” he said, “just what I expected.” And then seeing Eleanor dissolved in tears, exclaimed, “My dear child, you are not surprised?” “No, no—not surprised.” “Nor disappointed?” Eleanor shook her head, but not with emphasis. “Nor dissatisfied?” “Oh, Frank, can you ask me that?” “Why, Eleanor, you must have foreseen this inevitable result for the last six weeks, and you have seemed to me to acquiesce in it.” “Frank, you know how I have been engrossed the last six weeks; and, besides, what could I do? Grace has always been independent, self-directing, not a person to be interfered with.” “But, Eleanor, it is true I have been lost in my own affairs, but I thought there was a tacit agreement among us to acquiesce in Grace's decision?” “And is a mere acquiescence what we should feel at this crisis of our dear, noble sister's fate?” “Certainly it is not all we desire to feel, but most marriages, Eleanor, are compromises.” “Ours was not, Frank.” “No, but Grace could hardly expect another romance, ripened into a reality, which ours has been,” replied Esterly, kissing his wife with the enthusiasm of a lover; “once I did hope for its parallel for Grace. I was impatient for Lisle's return. I thought `propinquity' only was wanting to combine their destiny, but before he came home, Grace was entangled in this affair—her mind, if not her heart, was preoccupied. It's a failure I confess, but after all, not so bad. Think how long Copley has been steadily devoted to Grace —that augurs well.” “I know him better than you do, Frank. Pride had more to do with his devotion, than love.” “All men are made of mixed elements, Eleanor. I trust you do Copley injustice.” “No, no, Frank, I do not. He is false. Anne Carlton has confided to me his insidious flattery to her. I believe the silly girl was half hoping he would offer himself to her; but far worse than that, he has, up to last week, kept up his intimacy with Mrs. Tallis, and in her husband's absence has been every day at her house—so Mrs. Milnor, who lives opposite, told me. She says his French valet is every morning at Mrs. Tallis' door with bouquets, and perfumed notes.” “`Perfumed!' Does Mrs. Milnor nose them across the street? I wonder, Eleanor, that you should listen for a moment to such an audacious gossip—an unclean bird that lives on carrion.” Esterly, like most men, would scarcely have taken a gossip's word against a murderer. “I hear much good of Copley,” he resumed, “of late. He has become a teacher in our Sunday-school.” “I am sorry to hear it. I have no opinion of religious cloaks over moral delinquencies.” “But, Eleanor, he may have thrown off the polluted garments, and not covered them. Give him his due—have you forgotten Violet's free papers?” “Certainly not, Frank; but, doubtless, Grace incited him to that good deed.” “And will to other deeds as good. Come, come, Eleanor, think what power she will have; what a fortune to dispense; what a wide influence! Look on the bright side. Grace's fate may be next best to ours.” “Next best! Ah, Frank, you do not know Grace, if you think a `next best' in marriage would be endurable to her. No, she will have nothing, if not a love and confidence like ours—ever growing; our smallest joy, and our keenest sorrow binding us closer together; a mutual dependence, and an individual freedom springing from reciprocal faith, love, and charity; each a life apart, and a life together.” “Why, Ellen! what a fine theory of marriage.” “A theory evolved from our experience, Frank.” “True, my blessed wife; but ours is the fate of but one pair in a thousand; we must take life as it is.” “Should we not rather, Frank, try to make it what it should be?” “An odd question to put to a preacher by profession. But, truly, Eleanor, how is this matter to be reformed, unless, as Dr. Johnson proposes, we leave it to the chancellor to couple men and women. Marriage is one of the merest chances of life, the most difficult and painful of all social problems. Just fancy the extravagance of expecting that the people I tie together should be qualified for the most complex partnership of life.” “Then, my husband, do not lend your voice to the general vulgar view of life, and say, `A woman must be married.' Surely it is better she should be a lonely struggler, an `old maid' driven into corners, than to sacrifice her truth, to live in the closest and dearest relation of life, stripped of all that makes life dear. Better utter isolation and desertion, than to perjure herself by a vow of love, honor, and obedience, that she can not keep.” “I agree with you, theoretically, Eleanor, but practically what is to be done? Do you know a woman who would live single, if she could help it?” “Yes, indeed, Frank, and so do you. Noble women who have preferred single life to making hollow vows; poverty, if you will have it so, to failure.” “But these are exceptional cases, my dear.” “So they are, but there would be many more, if women were true to themselves, and true to their own sex. Many a woman, when she gets a husband, looks upon herself as a general who has won the battle, and may sleep upon his laurels for the rest of his life, and she looks down upon her single sisters from her matrimonial height. The first practical 4* lesson she teaches her daughters is, that an `old maid' is an impersonation of whimsicalities, at best to be pitied, and that her condition is, at all risks, to be avoided. All vulgar men speak of single women with scorn or pity, and such men as you, Frank, are reconciled to such marriages as my sister's will be, because—`she must be married!'” “Well, since you drive me to it, I defend my position. It is never wise to run counter to the institutions of Providence. Marriage is the first and greatest of these, the central point, whence all the relations of life radiate, the source of all political and social virtue. The husband and wife are priest and priestess in the temple consecrated and upheld by God himself.” “And is this temple to be turned into a den of thieves, a market for money-changers, Frank? Is its strength to be impaired and its purity polluted by compromise-marriages? You say that marriage is the source of all political and social virtue; and so I believe, and that we must thank the low rate of conjugal virtue, for there being so little of either. And how should conscientious statesmen, pure patriots, honest dealers, faithful children, loving brothers and sisters, and loyal friends spring from marriages, such as they are. The world has made slow progress from this starting-point, Frank.” “My dear wife, I believe you have the right, but if you had ever undertaken one social reform, you would know how hopeless is change of the very form and pressure of society.” “But remember, Frank, the mouse and the lion in the fable. The weakest may do something by using their small power in the right direction. Women's testimony does not go very far, but do you, Frank, and other accepted teachers, teach my doctrine in simplicity and godly sincerity. Don't go on in the common rut and multiply these miserable matings (not unions), by saying `women must be married.' If a woman misses her highest destiny, if she can not fold her heart in the bands of conjugal affection, fortified by congenial education, taste, and disposition, if she can not vitalize her union with a religious sentiment, then for pity's sake, dear Frank, counsel her to try `that other fate.' Teach her that she can prepare her soul for its eternal destiny without marriage—that she can be sister, friend, and benefactor; and that to do her duty within the wide compass of these relations, is far more honorable in the judgment of man, than to be a mismated wife and incompetent mother, condemned to stagnation instead of progress, and finding the last only and miserable consolation in the resignation to an indissoluble tie!” This long conversation begun at home, was finished on their way to Grace's. Late as it was in the evening, they both felt a desire to shelter their lukewarmness by their promptness. They were just at Mrs. Herbert's door when Eleanor ended her last sentence: men, the most earnest, the most serious, do not regard marriage with the solemnity that a thoughtful woman does. A woman casts all on that venture; a man has other argosies at sea. “It is a little odd, Eleanor,” said Esterly, half smiling, “that you have bestowed no part of this lecture upon Grace, and that here we are on our way to congratulate her.” “Oh, I know I was cowardly,” said Eleanor; “I now reproach myself bitterly, but till very lately I thought that Grace could not be dragged into this maëlstrom.” “Well, well, my dear child, now do the next wisest thing, and since you can not prevent this marriage, make the best of it.” The sisters met with tearful smiles. The common phrases of the occasion were spoken, so beautiful when, bearing the soul's impress, they drop from the heart like fresh coin from the mint and ring like true metal. Grace was not radiant, but there was a certain satisfaction evident, such as one feels who has struggled through an entangled path and comes out on a clear road. But how far was this from the feeling befitting such an occasion. “A content so absolute, That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate!” When Mr. Herbert broke away from Grace after that breakfast which was only a fast, he directed his course towards the sole light that glimmered through the darkness closing around him. And after reaching and mounting a long stairway in Wall-street, and passing through a large office, he went on by virtue of his general passport, into a little den where Lisle took refuge from suitors and clerks. Here the old friend was admitted when the rest of the world was shut out. Here he had lounged through many a pleasant hour, and placing no guard over his heart, and little upon his tongue, he had rashly intimated what he most desired, and freely told what most of all things he deprecated. His love for the young man seemed even to himself so out of bound, that at parting he often quoted Falstaff's words, saying, “Ah, Archy, you have given me medicines!” But alas! poor old man, he was in no laughing vein now. He found Lisle arranging his affairs for his departure with Letty Alsop's remains for the home burial. He sprang forward to give his friend his usual cordial welcome. Walter Herbert turned away, his face full of struggling feeling, and stood by a window, gazing down into a little dark court, but seeing only the desolate chambers of his own mind. “What has happened?” said Lisle affectionately, laying his hand on the old man's shoulder. “What is the matter, sir?” “Matter!” He turned round as if wound up to a pitch of fierceness, and then like an angry child melting into tears, he said in a broken voice, “Nothing but what should have been expected—she's gone, Lisle.” “Gone! dead—who?” “Oh, no, not dead, but lost for ever to me, and to you. Grace, my darling is—is—engaged!” No further question was put, no word spoken; each understood the other perfectly. The young man turned white as the unwritten paper on his desk; and after Walter Herbert left him, he sat as if paralyzed for half an hour; then giving his clerks their instructions, he shut himself up till the hour of his departure. He tried to master himself, but Letty was dead, and Grace worse than dead, and the world was very dark to him. After fulfilling his engagement with Mrs. Tallis on the evening of his betrothal, Copley returned to his mother's house. He passed the drawing-room from which the punctual lady had retired at her stated time, and went to his own sitting-room, where he found Sam Belson awaiting him, and the flood-gates being open, he did not shut them. “Why, bless my soul!” exclaimed Belson, throwing his unfinished cigar away, “what dead earnest you seem to be in.” “I am earnest and triumphant. You know, Sam, I have been pursuing this one object for years.” Belson laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and replied, “Yes, so you have, Cope, with some pleasant little détours; you are capital, Copley.” “Capital! why, what do you mean?” “Nothing, nothing, I assure you; I am only amused to see you as much elated as if you had conquered a kingdom.” “I have—my kingdom.” “Not by the knights Valor and Love, though you seem to say so.” “I do say so; and what can you say to the contrary?” “Pshaw! Cope, don't fire up; that is not your cue. Why, did you ever suppose after you minded the fortress with that lawsuit, that it would not yield? You remember I told you that was a masterly tactic.” “You have misunderstood me; upon my honor you have, Sam,” said Copley, reddening; “and certainly you do not know Miss Herbert.” “Nor ever shall. The lady once refused to permit me to be introduced to her. I shall not ask the favor a second time, though since that memorable epoch, she has stooped from her pride of place. They are devilish poor, I hear. She ought to overlook my foibles, being near of kin to yours.” “As to that, Sam, Miss Herbert is like other women, comme-il-faut. They do not know, or care, or think about such matters. But if you imagine she has been governed by a sordid motive, your judgment may be the natural result of your own experience, but I assure you, it is a false one.” Belson looked askance at Copley with an indescribable leer of derision, and Copley, maintaining his seriousness, and betraying a sincere indignation, which his faith in Grace inspired, Belson said, “Come, come, Copley, don't let us fall out now; I thought you had got beyond woman-worship. Upon my word, I meant no special disrespect to Miss Herbert; I only do not imagine she is an exception to the sex. Show me a disinterested patriot among politicians, a parson who preaches for the pure love of souls, a just merchant, and I will show you a woman who has no price. Pshaw! Copley, they can all be bought: you know it. A poor girl, ever so innocent—like young Jessie—with a few baubles, and soft words, and fine dresses; Tallis' wife, with a little larger amount of the same coin; the mass of them, with a trousseau, a nuptial ceremony, and an establishment; and a reduced gentlewoman, be she ever so well-born, clever, and accomplished—and your affiancée is all this—will let herself be knocked off to the bid of half a million, and the mirror of all the Graces into the bargain,” and Belson bowed low to Copley as he finished. The poisoned chalice was returned to Copley's lips. He was silent. “Good-night to you, Copley,” resumed Belson, after a long pause. “I am going West. You need not ask me to the wedding. I never countenance weddings or funerals. But after this is over, the wedding I mean, we may take up life together, and yet spin some glittering threads. Good-night, pleasant dreams to you—dreams a month long, and then awake to married life with what appetite you may. Good-night!” This was said much in the temper and voice of the first nuptial greeting to the first pair: “Live while ye may, Yet happy pair: enjoy, till I return, Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Eleanor:— “You will not be surprised to hear that H. C. and I have come to the end of our long and intricate journey. Shall we have a glad welcome from you, and a blessing from my brother? G. H.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “Now, Truth, perform thine office!” Grace had eagerly escaped from Mrs. Herbert's forced politeness, Miss Anne's sulkiness, and, above all, from her dear uncle's pathetic countenance, and passed the interim of her lover's absence with her sister at Harlem; where, in her obscure dwelling, she realized that home is made of a woman's heart, and its various relations and dependencies —not of marble, or brick and mortar, or even of May's magical “wood painted white.” She came to town with her sister and brother-in-law on the day of her lover's expected return. They were sitting with Mrs. Herbert's family around her tea-table. If there was ever an hour in life when Mrs. Herbert's platitudes could be acceptable, it was such a one as this, when every one else was kept silent by suspended or disquieted feeling and fluttering expectation. Mrs. Herbert herself seemed flooded with serenity, as if neither “crosses nor losses” had ever invaded her lot. “How much we miss you, dear Eleanor,” she said, “and the children, dear little ones. But you must find being in the country a great saving of time—life seems so cut up, so very short in town; don't you think so, Mr. Esterly?” “I don't know, madam; reckoned in poor Charles Lamb's fanciful mode, by the waste of it, it should seem fearfully long.” “Long or short,” interposed Miss Carlton, “there is not half enough of it to do what one wishes. Mamma and I have been trying so hard, dear Eleanor, every day to get out to see you in your dear little cottage, but something always chances to prevent us—it is so tiresome.” “`Lord have macy on fine ladies for all the lies they tell,' as poor old Di' says,” whispered Uncle Walter to Grace, who sat at his side. “Now, just listen to Eleanor's answer, it will be gracious, and true, too, I'll be bound.” But before the answer was finished, a carriage stopped at the door, the door-bell rang, an ominous silence heralded the expected guest, and Mr. Copley entered. It was his first appearance since the engagement. Mrs. Herbert and Anne had had time to prepare their masks; the rest never wore them. The blood rushed to Grace's cheeks as her lover kissed the hand she extended to him. Eleanor, too, gave him her hand, but, truth itself, she spoke not a word. He looked in her face, and no doubt his vanity interpreted satisfactorily the emotion it expressed. Esterly looked grave. After exchanging the common civilities of meeting, he felt that something more was expected, and he said, “I congratulate you, Mr. Copley; my wife is perfection—and Grace is her sister.” “A little equivocal,” interposed Mrs. Herbert; “no doubt Mr. Esterly means that our dear Grace will go on to perfection now that she is to be so fortunate, so happy. I hold that success is as propitious to the character as—as—” “Sugar-plums to children, mamma. By the way, Mr. Copley,” added Miss Anne, “though you did not give all your's to Grace—your sugar-plums, I mean—I was not quite so blind as you may imagine. I have seen all along that the farce of `Love 's a riddle' was to end in this charming way.” Grace turned her eye upon Anne Carlton; its flash disclosed the hollowness of that vessel; she paled under it, and was silent. Walter Herbert sat sipping his tea, not moving or even looking up. Grace put her hand on his shoulder, and said, in a low accent that meant more than met the ear, “Uncle Walter.” He started to his feet, and offered his reluctant hand to Copley. “Excuse me, Mr. Copley,” he said, “excuse me; I make it a rule never to congratulate people, till they have been married half a score of years.” “Then, sir,” replied Copley, with an animation that mollified Mr. Herbert, “at the end of ten years I will be sure to claim my dues, with interest.” “Come, sit down, Mr. Copley,” said Mrs. Herbert, “here, near me; you can't do better, since brother and Mr. Esterly have placed Grace a prisoner between them—very wrong, gentlemen! I hope you observe, Mr. Copley, that I have endeavored to do honor to the occasion—to dress my tea-table en pleine toilette. You see John has served my best china, and the bouquet was expressly ordered for your welcome; Thorburn has really done his best.” “`There's rhue for me'—do you see it?” whispered Anne to Copley. “You observe,” resumed Mrs. Herbert, “the silver vase that contains the flowers, is something quite out of the common way. I keep it locked, you know, Eleanor, in my silver safe—it's so precious. It was your poor father's gift to me on our wedding-day; and now, dear Grace, I present it to you as a pleasant souvenir of your poor father's bridal.” Grace tried to speak decent thanks, but the words died on her lips. Anne, whose eyes on some occasions were as quick as a detective policeman's, saw her embarrassment, and smiled. “What are you smiling at, Anne?” asked her mother. “Anne has been so happy since this event.” “Nonsense, mamma; such `events' to other people don't particularly delight me.” Anne turned her eye to Copley, and heaved an honest sigh. “What did you then smile at, my dear?” “I have forgotten; it might be Mr. Copley's elaborate toilet after his railroad journey. What did we hear at the play about an `hour's delay in love?'” Miss Carlton's poor spite passed unheeded, for at this moment a servant brought in a letter, with a paper parcel carelessly tied, and laid it down before her. “This is not for me, John,” she said, and passed the letter to Grace. “Why, what a direction!” she exclaimed, looking at the parcel— “ `Miss Herbert, Bond-street.' One would think it was written by a maniac.” Miss Anne partook the very common curiosity to see the inside of a parcel. As if unconsciously, and all the while talking to Eleanor, she fumbled at the carelessly-tied string till it came off; the paper opened, and the contents rolled on the floor: fans, rings, bits of fantastical jewelry, a splendid opera-glass, a certain delicately-carved cigarette-case, and a diamond bracelet. Walter Herbert moved back his chair. “Hallo! what's all this?” he exclaimed. “Dear me,” cried Mrs. Herbert, “the engagement has got wind. Dear Grace, what a quantity of splendid wedding presents!” “Good heavens!” exclaimed Anne Carlton, picking up the bracelet, and darting her eyes from Grace to Copley, “as I live, Mrs. Tallis' bracelet! What can it mean?” “God knows!” exclaimed Copley, and perhaps unconscious that he had spoken, he rushed, like a felon from justice, out of the room, and out of the house. Miss Anne, for once inspired by her mother's genius, condescended to borrow her aphoristic style, and murmured, with ineffable relief, “`There's many a slip between the cup and the lip.'” Eleanor's eyes were fixed on her sister; her's had not turned from the letter, which was rustling in her shaking hand. She was blind and deaf to all that was passing around her. Without reading the letter, she had, by a sweeping glance over it, and as if by intuition, comprehended its mission, and refolding it, she left the room. When she came to her own apartment, she felt that her intellects were confused and made incapable by the sudden shock; she paced up and down, till she became calm and quite self-possessed. She then lighted the gas, and sat down to the considerate reading of the letter that follows. It was illegibly written, evidently by snatches, and blotted with tears. To Grace's sharpened sense every word was clear; to her quickened feeling, every meaning sharp as steel. It began:—“She is dead!—my child, Elise is dead. God's curse has fallen on me—she is dead—gone from me forever and forever. “I kneel by her hour after hour—the hours are minutes, and the minutes are hours—there is no change. She is still —oh, so still!—this restless little body that at my least look would fly into my arms. I kiss her with my burning lips; they do not warm hers. I take up the little hand that used to grasp mine, and it falls, heavy and cold. My heart throbs till I think life stirs in her, but there is no life there. She is dead—Elise, dead? “She was a sweet fountain in my life-desert. She should have kept me from wrong-doing. She did not, and so I lost her—my darling, darling child. I loved her as I have loved nothing else. I never loved my husband. My child loved him. And when I think of that, and look upon her, it does not much comfort me that I have not been criminal toward her father, in the world's sense. I see written on my spotless child, `Blessed are the pure in spirit.' And I am sure I feel that such as are not so, are cursed. “One ray of light has penetrated my thick darkness. One duty appears before me: it seems as if my child had spoken to me, and that does comfort me, though my head throbs, so that I know not if I can do what I would. I will try. “I have moved away from her. I have dropped the curtain all around her bed, so that I can not see her while I write. I will try to write distinctly. Oh, how could she die? so full she was of life and love. “Stop—let me think. It was that evening my darling first showed signs of this fatal illness. She had been hanging round me all the afternoon, but I think she did not complain till after a note was brought in to me from Copley, informing me of your engagement, and telling me he would come to me in the course of the evening. She was sitting with her arm over my shoulder, and her little cheek resting on my breast. I was singing to her—the last time. I dearly loved to sing to her; how she loved it; how she would ask for `more and more.' I learned every pretty ballad I could hear of, to sing to her. When I had read the note, she begged me to sing more. She said her head did not pain her when I sang. I thought it was just a little pretext, she was so petted. Poor little darling! “I must tell the whole humiliating truth. Copley's note set me off crying with vexation, and mortified vanity. Not disappointed love; no, no, it was not love; no, I never loved that bad man. My child kissed off my tears, unworthy the touch of her lips; I rang for her nurse. Again Elise told me she had pain. I called her `a little make-be-lieve,' and kissed her, and sent her away. Oh, my God! if I could have her now, but one moment living, in my arms!” “Copley came—I will tell all, for so I resolved on my knees by my little angel's side. His sacrilegious lips touched my cheek, still warm with my child's caress. I do not remember distinctly much of what he said. Like a dream, it has been all swept away before the dreadful realities that followed. I remember we sat together, and walked the room together, hour after hour. Twice, nurse knocked at the door, and told me Elise was asking for me. I gave no heed; nature was dead within me. God forsook me when I sent my child away. “Oh, yes, now it comes back to me, some things he said that dreadful evening. `He must marry, sooner or later.' He believed his incentive in the pursuit of you had been the difficulty of attaining you. You piqued his pride. He chose to pursue, not to be caught by the `eager mothers, and ready daughters,' and stuff like that. And then, oh, how he flattered me. How he has, from the beginning, talked of my beauty, my grace, my magnetic attraction, my exquisite taste in dress. Think of my folly; think of it—and of my punishment. Oh, my child, my child! “Why did I not leave him, and go to my darling? Had I only gone to her little bed to kiss her, as I went to my room!—it was the first time I ever missed it—it was my sin that kept me from her. Perhaps I might have saved her if I had called the doctor then—that way lies madness. She was awake all night, nurse says, and continually asking her for me; and when they called me in the morning, she was in a fit. Since then she has not known me. She has not felt my kisses. I tried every song she loved, and sang till I fainted quite away, but she gave no heed; God would not let her. She would never have left me of her own free will. “Her father is absent. Poor Rupert! he will never see her, not even as she lies now—dead. Oh, that horrid word, it seems as if I had never heard it, never seen it before. He will be comforted, for he has not offended. He uttered no false marriage vows, nor has he broken them in thought, word, or deed. “Now that I have done this one duty left in the dark world before me, I look on my child with less torture. I seem to have taken one step toward her. “Augusta Tallis. “P. S.—I send you all the trinkets he has given me. Dispose of them as you will; throw them into the street, if you will, and let these witnesses of my vanity and folly be trodden under foot.” Half an hour after, Eleanor softly opened the door and entered her sister's room. Grace was kneeling beneath her mother's picture; it was the place she had fondly chosen, when a child, to say her prayers, and she had retained it for that holy office with something of the feeling of a Catholic in devout communion with her dearest saint; she raised her head. All struggle was over; there was a heavenly peace on her glowing face. “Come here, dear sister,” she said, “and help me thank the beneficent Providence that has saved me from perdition.” Their arms were interlaced and their hearts melted together in one silent, fervent thanksgiving. Grace gave Eleanor Mrs. Tallis' letter. She wiped away her tears as she finished the reading. “Poor mother! poor woman!” she murmured, “what can be done for her? She has neither mother, nor sister, nor, I believe, one intimate friend.” Grace impulsively answered to what she felt as an appeal. “Shall I go to her, Eleanor?” she said. “She is alone with her servants. She must need some one who knows her whole calamity. I may come between her soul and its despair—I have been at least as weak as she, and therefore my presence will be no reproach to her.” “Yes, go, dear Grace, and support and comfort her if you can; but do not silence the reproaches of her conscience; remember in whose name conscience speaks.” Eleanor paused, Grace rang the bell, and bade the servant order a carriage. “I thought her so weak,” said Grace, “I would not have believed there were elements in her for so fearful a tempest. I am afraid she will lose her senses when it comes to the last.” “No, Grace, I think not. I think I hear from out the storm that gracious voice, `It is I, be not afraid!'” “What do you mean? I do not understand you, Eleanor.” “I see in her remorse and in her hard struggle to do the duty nearest to her, that God is dealing with her soul, and that she accepts his dealing.” “Oh, Eleanor, you are so much more religiously wise than I am, so much wiser every way, that you, not I, should go to her.” “No, Grace, for every reason it is better you should go. Mrs. Tallis must be approached through her feelings. But do not, dear Grace, in your pity and anxiety for her present relief, lose sight of her future good. She receives her child's death as punishment; her mind is filled with this idea. Make her feel, if you can, that this is not the way that our great Shepherd in his infinite love deals with us. He chastises us, not because we leave the fold, but to make us conscious of our wanderings, to bring us back and keep us there. If the child had lived she would have followed the fashion of her mother's life; that would have been the real misery. Now the little loving creature's death may bring her mother out of her idle useless life, may lead to right relations to her husband, to a sincere, effectual repentance. To this great end, you must persuade her the bitter draught the great Physician has put into her hand must be drunk, not turned aside; and that he gives it to restore, not torment.” “How right you are, Eleanor, and as much better than I, as a cure is than a cordial. I thought only of paying the infinite debt I owe this poor lady, by giving her what comfort I could in her desolation. Now, by your aid, I will be true to her, and try to help as well as comfort her. How different, dear sister,” she said, as she stooped to kiss Eleanor good-night, “is this from the sweet peace at your child's death!” “Yes, thank God, it is very different; but Grace, that affliction discovered moth and rust gathering on our Christian armor, that we had not perceived.” “And the angel of death brings in his hand this divine anointing for all our eyes, does he not, Eleanor?” Grace replied with a pensive smile, and as she paused at the door, her face radiant with a sense of her great deliverance, she added, in a low voice, “May I not say devoutly that `whereas I was blind, I now see?'” Once out of the room, she turned back, and in an altered tone said, “Think of my forgetting Uncle Walter! Go to him, Eleanor, tell him I have passed the Dead Sea I have been drifting down the last five days; that I am free and happy, and his own child again; and if he wishes, tell him all how it is—most likely I shall never speak of it again.” The good news was told to Walter Herbert. It was health to him by day and sleep by night. VOL. II. 5 At two in the morning, Grace, having withdrawn, from the apartment in which the body of Elise was lying, to Mrs. Tallis' library, wrote the following letter to her sister: “Dear Eleanor:— “When I came to this house, I summoned Mrs. Tallis' maid, and inquired for her mistress. `Oh, Miss,' she said, `it would scare you to see her. The poor lady has not left the nursery since first the child was taken ill. You can go in, for she takes no notice who goes in or who comes out; she seems to know nothing but that the child is dead. She has swallowed nothing but a sip of tea or coffee; she has not had a brush through her hair, and only takes her bath, and slips on her dressing-gown, as if she grudges the minutes she's away from Miss Elise's side.' I stopped her prating, and went, as seemed to me best, directly to Mrs. Tallis. Oh, Eleanor, what a spectacle! The last time I saw Augusta Tallis was at Mrs. Seton's ball, splendidly arrayed, brilliantly beautiful! She was now colorless as the little blighted blossom she hung over. Her flesh has melted away; she looks ten years older; and yet, haggard as she is, her hair matted, her dress neglected, her exquisite beauty impressed me as it never did before. It is now instinct with spirit, though the spirit be in prison and in torment. She was kneeling, when I entered, beside her child's little couch, her head lying on her child's low pillow. I went to her and laid my hand on her head. She did not notice me. I stood hoping for some sigh or motion—there was none. I turned my eyes to the child—she looks like a sleeping cherub—so serene, so lovely! Thoughts of the salvation she had wrought for me, flooded my heart. I kissed the shining locks on her temples, and murmured something, I know not what, expressions of my debt to her. The mother started, as if from deep sleep and dreams, and said, `Who is it? what is it?' I sank down beside her, and put my arm around her quivering frame. `Dear friend,' I said, `I have come to thank you and to bless her—you and your child have saved me, Augusta. She inspired you to write that letter to me.' I shall never forget the instant change of her countenance—it was from death to life—from despair to hope. `I thought it was so,' she said; `she seemed to speak to me out of that death silence—to tell me the only thing left for me to do in this world—and I did it—and I shall see her again; shall I? Oh, tell me you believe I shall! that I am not a castaway!' I thought of your caution, Eleanor, and resisted my impulse to fold her to my bosom, and say nothing but the balmiest words I could think of. I spoke yours instead. `Surely I believe you will see your child again,' I said, `if you faithfully receive the admonition our heavenly Father sends to you through her.' `Oh, tell me what it is,' she said, `my head is so weak, so dizzy. Why, there is nothing left for me in this life to do—it is all empty and dark. My husband must hate me, must cast me off—our child has died by my neglect.' Now I soothed her, Eleanor; I begged her to be quiet, and to wait, and by-and-by she would see God's gracious purpose, if she would but look to him—his arms were always outstretched to the returning child. She seemed a little comforted and laid her head on my lap, and the tears flowed with less anguish. But she broke forth again, and wrung her hands and said, `Oh, she was not like any other child! she was so sweet! so bright! such a merry laugh— did you ever hear her laugh? Oh, my heavens, I shall never laugh again! And she could be so quiet. When I had my nervous head-aches she would lie by me for an hour with her little cool hand on my forehead, and if I but sighed she would kiss me; but she will never kiss me again, never, never!' By degrees I soothed away this paroxysm, and she permitted me to lay her on the sofa, and bathe her head, and while I stroked her temples, she fell asleep, and slept naturally for an hour, the first time, her woman avers, since the child became ill; but that can hardly be. Ignorant people are apt to express their sympathy by exaggerating the demonstrations of suffering. When Augusta awoke, she took, without resistance, the nourishment I offered. And what was more important, she seemed comforted by my presence, and ready to open her heart to me. She returned to her child's low couch, and after having sat by her a long time in thoughtful and tearless silence—`Oh, Grace,' she said, `I begin to comprehend what you said to me—that God's dealing with me was supremely wise and loving; was not that what you said? My head has been so confused— it is getting clearer now.' “`I believe all God's dealings with us are so,' I replied. “`I don't mean in general, but in particular to me—I see it is so.' It seemed for a moment as if she struggled to penetrate with the eye of faith the thick clouds that obstructed it, and then again she reverted to the treasure that had absorbed all her love, and giving way to a fresh burst of grief, she said, `I was not fit to be trusted with the precious spirit of my child. All I did was to pamper her, and to deck this little body in French finery. I loved her; yes, I loved her. God knows I loved her. But, oh, Grace, meanly, selfishly, wickedly. I could not bear she should love any one but me. I was jealous of her nurse, and bitterly jealous of her father. I used often to ask her if she did not love me better than she loved her father; and the dear little creature would say, `No mamma, I love you both alike; you are good to me, and papa is just as good to me, and I can't help loving him as well.' She was so true; she could not say what was not true, and it was wise and loving to take her away before I corrupted her. Oh, am I not humbled? I should have dragged down to earth that sweet heavenly spirit. I should have made her just what I am—a mere victim of vanity, living to no one good purpose. Poor Rupert! what will he say? what will he do? She was all he had in the world. I have done nothing for him, but to wear out of him all the goodness he had. He did love me. He does love me still.' After a pause, she said, with animation, as if the thought had just struck her, `Grace, Grace, do you think it possible that he can ever forgive me, and forget, and be happy again? Do you think it possible that I can love him, because I ought. Is that my child's admonition?' “I hesitated. She seemed gazing into the very depths of my soul. `Ah,' she said, `you do not believe it possible.' “Now, Eleanor, you may imagine how much I was perplexed what to answer her. You know how I have always maintained against you, whose nature it is to feel as well as to do right—and who, therefore, have it at will to love or not—that love is an instinct, or an impulse, or something quite independent of our will, or our conviction. I tried to think what you would reply to her, Eleanor. I was frightened, lest I should put some obstruction to the good work beginning in her heart, and while I hesitated, she said, `I do not believe you know how good Rupert is—how forbearing he has been with me—how much he has overlooked—how dreadfully I have tried him. And yet I think, I hope he still loves me.' “I can not express to you the relief I felt at these words. I could now answer as I wished, without belying my own convictions. I saw the child's death was working a change in the wife's heart. “`The desire for your husband's affections will turn yours toward him, Augusta. Feeling as you do, this bereavement, you will know what he feels, and from your infinite pity for him, affection must spring up; not a girlish love, but the considerate affection of a steadfast friend; and then she who now seems lost to you will not be lost, but the guardian angel of both.' Augusta looked at me, while I spoke, with an earnestness I can not describe to you, and when I finished, instead of replying to me by word, she sank on her knees, and bending her head over her child, she held such gracious communion, with Him who had stretched out his arms to receive the returning prodigal, as I think she never knew before. “It was a fitting preparation for what was to follow. Mrs. Tallis' maid opened the door, and beckoning to me, said, `Mr. Tallis had arrived, and would I please to go down to him?—he was in such an awful way they could do nothing with him.' No, thought I, if it be possible, his wife shall go to him. Now, while they are baptized in the same affliction, and the same grief, the past may be obliterated. The ice formed against him in her heart is already melting in this fiery crucible—the current may set to him. “Augusta had risen from her knees, and was looking to me. `Has he come?' she gasped out. `Yes, Augusta, will you go to him? You alone can comfort him.' `I,' she said, `I comfort him?' After hesitating a moment, and gazing again at her child, as if from her to draw strength and courage, she said, `Yes, I will go. I will tell him all; everything. He may—he may forgive me. Oh, Grace, he has a great heart.' “`Yes, I believe he has,' said I, delighted to perceive the subtle workings of her newly awakened feeling for him, `and Augusta, such greatness is goodness; trust to it.' “`I will,' she replied; and added, with almost a smile beaming through the sweetness of her face, `Our child bids me go to him.' “I wrapped a shawl around her, and supported her, shivering and tottering, to his door. He was weeping aloud when she went in. Then followed a fearful stillness. But afterward, here in the library, where I am sitting, over the drawing-room, I heard the murmur of their low, sad voices for half an hour. I doubt not there was humble and full confession from her, and forgiveness from him. Then they came up to Elise' nursery together, and the maid now tells me, that Mr. Tallis has gone, quite calm, to his own apartment, and she is falling asleep on the sofa. Oh, Eleanor, if he has lost his child, has he not found his wife? “This is the second time that I have been so near to death as to penetrate with a sort of second sight its mysteries. When our mother died, I was too young for any thing but the dreadful sense of loss. Aunt Sarah told me she was gone to heaven, but what heaven was, or where, I knew not. She was gone from me forever; that I fully comprehended, and night after night I cried myself to sleep. But never, till I saw you and Frank meekly resign your child into the safe wardship of Him who gave him, did I know that the gates of immortality are never again closed to those whose eye of faith has seen one they loved pass through them. Thenceforth, this life has an unction from the life to come. “And to this house death has come as an angel, sowing with light and life the paths of these poor wanderers befogged by their own follies. And it has an angel's mission to all those for whom it sets its solemn seal and superscription on vanity, and levity, and worldliness, and all the utter waste of God's good gifts. “But, dear sister, in pointing the moral for others, I do not evade it for myself. This evening has been what your good little cousin Effie calls `a teaching period,' and I have had my own humbling task to con. “Eleanor, when you prescribed the medicine for Mrs. Tallis, you meant there should be enough for two. I have drank my portion, and now I send you the result; please examine it, dear physician, and tell me if it be right. “The blow to my vanity this evening was stunning, but my affections are unscathed. This is certain from my present satisfaction, and grateful sense of escape. If I had loved Horace Copley, blinded, beguiled, I might have been, but then I should have found extenuation in my delusion. Now, in my retrospect, I see how my weakness yielded to his stronger will, how his importunate flattery filled the vacuities of my life, and bribed my imagination to supply the defects in his character; obvious enough they were to my judgment, and glaring to my instincts. I certainly did not dream of such heartless profligacy as Mrs. Tallis' disclosure revealed; but at twenty-two, I should have reflected on what was meant by that term, `man of the world,' which I have more than once heard applied to him, and I ought to have reasoned far enough to conclude that a man, false in his relations to our sex, is unsound, is false throughout, and that his integrity is not to be trusted when assailed by temptation, come in what form it may. “This man has been a sort of possession to me. What hours, hours! years of precious responsible life I have wasted on him. I now dismiss him from my mind forever, and truly without resentment or contempt; he has exercised too much power over me for contempt, and for resentment, Eleanor, my self-abasement is too deep, my penitence too keen, to permit resentment. You are my confessor, dear sister. Every sound is hushed within and without. The city is steeped in solemn silence. I feel like making a clean breast of it, so have patience. I begin with a confession that makes my cheeks burn, while I write it. I was, no, I was not jealous of Anne Carlton, but the thought that she might finally triumph over me, would intrude, and I could not brook it. I looked forward with pleasure to baffling Mrs. Herbert's manœuvring. I will keep the memory of those miserable vanities as a scourge for all future intrusions of this subtle weakness, which like the fretting worm works into the very root of virtue. Don't tell your husband, Eleanor; I am not humbled enough for that. To you alone, who are so good, so `lowly-wise,' and to my God can I confess this most humiliating weakness. “I have gifts that compel the world to admire me, and make Anne Carlton, and birds of her feather, hate me—it would be mock-modesty to deny it—and other gifts that make you and Frank, and my dear Uncle Walter, love me; but what use have I made of them, Eleanor? I have been one of the veriest idlers in that wide harvest-field, where the laborers are few and the harvest still plenteous. I have made myself my own centre; I have studied art and literature as ends, not means; I have fretted in the harness of the frivolous society in which my lot was cast, but I have not thrown it off; I craved, and expected—as I believe most young women do—an adoring, exclusive love, as if we came into this working world merely to worship idols, and be idols in turn; in short, Eleanor, amid my morbid repinings, and insolent exactions of Providence, I sought for peace everywhere but where it is to be found, and where, being found, all pure human affections, all gifts and graces, all diversities of attainments, are its gracious accessories, never its substitutes. “I have looked upon you, sweet sister, wrapped in your humility, and going through the paths of duty heavenward, as my inferior, because you had not my longings—aspirations, I think I called them in my nomenclature. The steeps I climbed were as the mere mole-hills on earth's surface, while your way led up those shining heights seen only by the eye of faith. You, Eleanor, have been like sunshine in your course, imparting vitality to every thing you touched; 5* even the few possible virtues in our step-mother and in Anne Carlton have put forth and blossomed in your beams; whereas I have been the sphynx, with its riddle, to them, and they, heaven knows, a desert to me. “I lay some trifling unction to my soul from the fact that your plastic youth was moulded by our martyr-aunt, while my willful and wayward childhood was left to the corrosions of Mrs. Herbert, and dear Uncle Walter's petting, which nurtured my affections, and thereby brought forth some flowers, but certainly had no tendency to root out the weeds. “But these are accidents; the difference between us is essential. You have been a Christian, and lived a Christian's life; I have been a heathen, and lived a heathen's life. I know the inscription is the same to us both—all those who are baptized, and have conformed to the rule of their church, as I have to ours, are called Christians, as I am called; but I also know, that those only are so who hear His word and do it. “Dear sister, I have had a long life in this solemn night, if time is to be reckoned by sensations. I have laid the cross upon my heart, and comprehended, as I never did before, this symbol of humility, love, and fidelity. “I am penitent, Eleanor. Time must prove whether I am repentant.” The following passage from a recent publication seems to us of so apt an application to Grace Herbert's letter, that we take the liberty to enrich our pages with it: “Have you, reader, ever experienced a great sorrow? and if so, have you not seen afterward how it discloses heights and depths in your spiritual nature which you had never known, and resources upon which you had never drawn; how it produces susceptibilities which you had never before felt; how it induces a tenderness of mind that makes it ductile almost as the clay, and ready to receive the stamp of the divine image; how little animosities and hatreds are banished and forgotten, while the heart has new yearnings toward all that live, and especially toward all that suffer; how the soul sickens at mere shows and appearances, and demands realities, while it hungers after the good and the true; how this world recedes less, while the world of immortality comes on as if now first revealed, and incloses you in its light, just as when the glare of the day is withdrawn and the darkness moves over us, we gaze on a new sky, and bathe in the starry splendors of the milky way?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It began:—“She is dead!—my child, Elise is dead. God's curse has fallen on me—she is dead—gone from me forever and forever. “I kneel by her hour after hour—the hours are minutes, and the minutes are hours—there is no change. She is still —oh, so still!—this restless little body that at my least look would fly into my arms. I kiss her with my burning lips; they do not warm hers. I take up the little hand that used to grasp mine, and it falls, heavy and cold. My heart throbs till I think life stirs in her, but there is no life there. She is dead—Elise, dead? “She was a sweet fountain in my life-desert. She should have kept me from wrong-doing. She did not, and so I lost her—my darling, darling child. I loved her as I have loved nothing else. I never loved my husband. My child loved him. And when I think of that, and look upon her, it does not much comfort me that I have not been criminal toward her father, in the world's sense. I see written on my spotless child, `Blessed are the pure in spirit.' And I am sure I feel that such as are not so, are cursed. “One ray of light has penetrated my thick darkness. One duty appears before me: it seems as if my child had spoken to me, and that does comfort me, though my head throbs, so that I know not if I can do what I would. I will try. “I have moved away from her. I have dropped the curtain all around her bed, so that I can not see her while I write. I will try to write distinctly. Oh, how could she die? so full she was of life and love. “Stop—let me think. It was that evening my darling first showed signs of this fatal illness. She had been hanging round me all the afternoon, but I think she did not complain till after a note was brought in to me from Copley, informing me of your engagement, and telling me he would come to me in the course of the evening. She was sitting with her arm over my shoulder, and her little cheek resting on my breast. I was singing to her—the last time. I dearly loved to sing to her; how she loved it; how she would ask for `more and more.' I learned every pretty ballad I could hear of, to sing to her. When I had read the note, she begged me to sing more. She said her head did not pain her when I sang. I thought it was just a little pretext, she was so petted. Poor little darling! “I must tell the whole humiliating truth. Copley's note set me off crying with vexation, and mortified vanity. Not disappointed love; no, no, it was not love; no, I never loved that bad man. My child kissed off my tears, unworthy the touch of her lips; I rang for her nurse. Again Elise told me she had pain. I called her `a little make-be-lieve,' and kissed her, and sent her away. Oh, my God! if I could have her now, but one moment living, in my arms!” “Copley came—I will tell all, for so I resolved on my knees by my little angel's side. His sacrilegious lips touched my cheek, still warm with my child's caress. I do not remember distinctly much of what he said. Like a dream, it has been all swept away before the dreadful realities that followed. I remember we sat together, and walked the room together, hour after hour. Twice, nurse knocked at the door, and told me Elise was asking for me. I gave no heed; nature was dead within me. God forsook me when I sent my child away. “Oh, yes, now it comes back to me, some things he said that dreadful evening. `He must marry, sooner or later.' He believed his incentive in the pursuit of you had been the difficulty of attaining you. You piqued his pride. He chose to pursue, not to be caught by the `eager mothers, and ready daughters,' and stuff like that. And then, oh, how he flattered me. How he has, from the beginning, talked of my beauty, my grace, my magnetic attraction, my exquisite taste in dress. Think of my folly; think of it—and of my punishment. Oh, my child, my child! “Why did I not leave him, and go to my darling? Had I only gone to her little bed to kiss her, as I went to my room!—it was the first time I ever missed it—it was my sin that kept me from her. Perhaps I might have saved her if I had called the doctor then—that way lies madness. She was awake all night, nurse says, and continually asking her for me; and when they called me in the morning, she was in a fit. Since then she has not known me. She has not felt my kisses. I tried every song she loved, and sang till I fainted quite away, but she gave no heed; God would not let her. She would never have left me of her own free will. “Her father is absent. Poor Rupert! he will never see her, not even as she lies now—dead. Oh, that horrid word, it seems as if I had never heard it, never seen it before. He will be comforted, for he has not offended. He uttered no false marriage vows, nor has he broken them in thought, word, or deed. “Now that I have done this one duty left in the dark world before me, I look on my child with less torture. I seem to have taken one step toward her. “Augusta Tallis. “P. S.—I send you all the trinkets he has given me. Dispose of them as you will; throw them into the street, if you will, and let these witnesses of my vanity and folly be trodden under foot.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Eleanor:— “When I came to this house, I summoned Mrs. Tallis' maid, and inquired for her mistress. `Oh, Miss,' she said, `it would scare you to see her. The poor lady has not left the nursery since first the child was taken ill. You can go in, for she takes no notice who goes in or who comes out; she seems to know nothing but that the child is dead. She has swallowed nothing but a sip of tea or coffee; she has not had a brush through her hair, and only takes her bath, and slips on her dressing-gown, as if she grudges the minutes she's away from Miss Elise's side.' I stopped her prating, and went, as seemed to me best, directly to Mrs. Tallis. Oh, Eleanor, what a spectacle! The last time I saw Augusta Tallis was at Mrs. Seton's ball, splendidly arrayed, brilliantly beautiful! She was now colorless as the little blighted blossom she hung over. Her flesh has melted away; she looks ten years older; and yet, haggard as she is, her hair matted, her dress neglected, her exquisite beauty impressed me as it never did before. It is now instinct with spirit, though the spirit be in prison and in torment. She was kneeling, when I entered, beside her child's little couch, her head lying on her child's low pillow. I went to her and laid my hand on her head. She did not notice me. I stood hoping for some sigh or motion—there was none.

I have drank my portion, and now I send you the result; please examine it, dear physician, and tell me if it be right. “The blow to my vanity this evening was stunning, but my affections are unscathed. This is certain from my present satisfaction, and grateful sense of escape. If I had loved Horace Copley, blinded, beguiled, I might have been, but then I should have found extenuation in my delusion. Now, in my retrospect, I see how my weakness yielded to his stronger will, how his importunate flattery filled the vacuities of my life, and bribed my imagination to supply the defects in his character; obvious enough they were to my judgment, and glaring to my instincts. I certainly did not dream of such heartless profligacy as Mrs. Tallis' disclosure revealed; but at twenty-two, I should have reflected on what was meant by that term, `man of the world,' which I have more than once heard applied to him, and I ought to have reasoned far enough to conclude that a man, false in his relations to our sex, is unsound, is false throughout, and that his integrity is not to be trusted when assailed by temptation, come in what form it may. “This man has been a sort of possession to me. What hours, hours! years of precious responsible life I have wasted on him. I now dismiss him from my mind forever, and truly without resentment or contempt; he has exercised too much power over me for contempt, and for resentment, Eleanor, my self-abasement is too deep, my penitence too keen, to permit resentment. You are my confessor, dear sister. Every sound is hushed within and without. The city is steeped in solemn silence. I feel like making a clean breast of it, so have patience. I begin with a confession that makes my cheeks burn, while I write it. I was, no, I was not jealous of Anne Carlton, but the thought that she might finally triumph over me, would intrude, and I could not brook it. I looked forward with pleasure to baffling Mrs. Herbert's manœuvring. I will keep the memory of those miserable vanities as a scourge for all future intrusions of this subtle weakness, which like the fretting worm works into the very root of virtue. Don't tell your husband, Eleanor; I am not humbled enough for that. To you alone, who are so good, so `lowly-wise,' and to my God can I confess this most humiliating weakness. “I have gifts that compel the world to admire me, and make Anne Carlton, and birds of her feather, hate me—it would be mock-modesty to deny it—and other gifts that make you and Frank, and my dear Uncle Walter, love me; but what use have I made of them, Eleanor? I have been one of the veriest idlers in that wide harvest-field, where the laborers are few and the harvest still plenteous. I have made myself my own centre; I have studied art and literature as ends, not means; I have fretted in the harness of the frivolous society in which my lot was cast, but I have not thrown it off; I craved, and expected—as I believe most young women do—an adoring, exclusive love, as if we came into this working world merely to worship idols, and be idols in turn; in short, Eleanor, amid my morbid repinings, and insolent exactions of Providence, I sought for peace everywhere but where it is to be found, and where, being found, all pure human affections, all gifts and graces, all diversities of attainments, are its gracious accessories, never its substitutes. “I have looked upon you, sweet sister, wrapped in your humility, and going through the paths of duty heavenward, as my inferior, because you had not my longings—aspirations, I think I called them in my nomenclature. The steeps I climbed were as the mere mole-hills on earth's surface, while your way led up those shining heights seen only by the eye of faith. You, Eleanor, have been like sunshine in your course, imparting vitality to every thing you touched; 5* even the few possible virtues in our step-mother and in Anne Carlton have put forth and blossomed in your beams; whereas I have been the sphynx, with its riddle, to them, and they, heaven knows, a desert to me. “I lay some trifling unction to my soul from the fact that your plastic youth was moulded by our martyr-aunt, while my willful and wayward childhood was left to the corrosions of Mrs. Herbert, and dear Uncle Walter's petting, which nurtured my affections, and thereby brought forth some flowers, but certainly had no tendency to root out the weeds. “But these are accidents; the difference between us is essential. You have been a Christian, and lived a Christian's life; I have been a heathen, and lived a heathen's life. I know the inscription is the same to us both—all those who are baptized, and have conformed to the rule of their church, as I have to ours, are called Christians, as I am called; but I also know, that those only are so who hear His word and do it. “Dear sister, I have had a long life in this solemn night, if time is to be reckoned by sensations. I have laid the cross upon my heart, and comprehended, as I never did before, this symbol of humility, love, and fidelity. “I am penitent, Eleanor. Time must prove whether I am repentant.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Have you, reader, ever experienced a great sorrow? and if so, have you not seen afterward how it discloses heights and depths in your spiritual nature which you had never known, and resources upon which you had never drawn; how it produces susceptibilities which you had never before felt; how it induces a tenderness of mind that makes it ductile almost as the clay, and ready to receive the stamp of the divine image; how little animosities and hatreds are banished and forgotten, while the heart has new yearnings toward all that live, and especially toward all that suffer; how the soul sickens at mere shows and appearances, and demands realities, while it hungers after the good and the true; how this world recedes less, while the world of immortality comes on as if now first revealed, and incloses you in its light, just as when the glare of the day is withdrawn and the darkness moves over us, we gaze on a new sky, and bathe in the starry splendors of the milky way?”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Affection warm, and faith sincere, And soft humanity were there.” It was just at the close of day, a soft, showery April day, that the body which had invested Letty's sweet spirit was let softly down into its mother earth. The sun sent its slanting beams athwart the turf, jeweled by the shower, and checkered by the shadows of an old oak that spread its arms, as if in benediction, over the space allotted in the village church-yard to the Lisle family. The friends that had gathered to assist in the last reverential office had dispersed. Archibald alone lingered, leaning against a marble slab which marked his father's grave, and near which Letty was placed. We said he was alone; but not far from him stood the village sexton, leaning on his spade. The old man's few white hairs, curiously husbanded and braided, lay in a single lock on his forehead, making him look like the fit chief craftsman of “Time in the primmer.” “Uncle Phil” was the most venerated official of the village—his dynasty had been the longest. He had buried two generations, and turned into the dust some sweet blossoms of the third. Uncle Phil's hands were thus hallowed. Besides, in his private life, he was a single, kindly, true-hearted man, with a quaint humor that pleased the old, and drew the children to his knee. A touch of human vanity he had, but it ran in the professional line, and thus interfered with no one, and offended none. He was proud to be the ultimate authority in all the traditions of the burying-place, which he seemed to regard in some sort his private estate. He boasted that there was not an error in the records of his memory; that he could name each individual that mouldered in an unmarked grave; that he could tell the day and the hour when such and such a grave was dug; who had the longest procession; who was buried in the pomp of “mahogany and silver plate,” and who was laid down in humble “cherry.” These, and other analogous ghastly particulars, were as familiar as household words to Uncle Phil, but they never clouded his serene mind. Life was pleasant to him from sunrise to sunset—from the morning of youth, to the twilight of old age. Archibald was wiping the tears from his eyes, and turning to depart, when an expressive “hem, hem,” from Uncle Phil arrested him. “Ah, Archy,” he said, hobbling forward as fast as age and rheumatism would let him, and grasping the young man's hand, “I declare I'm glad to see you, tho' it's a kind o' solitary time with you. She was pretty”—in our rustic phrase, the most comprehensive of commendations—“it comes tough to me, Archy, to lay down such a young, kind creature as Letty Alsop was; but I guess she's better off— she was sort o' lonesome in this world.” Solitary, and lonesome, in Uncle Phil's social vocabulary, stood for all modes of wretchedness and uncomfortableness. “Yes, Uncle Phil,” replied Archy, “she is far better off, in every way;” and then, characteristically closing the door on his own griefs, he added, “I am very glad to see you able to be out after your great loss; I was very sorry to hear of it, Uncle Phil.” “I knew you would be, Archy. Gorry! 'twas hard. She was the only one we ever had. Her mother had not been dead but little more 'n a year, and Livy and I had lived together sixty years, three months, and seven days. She was the peaceablest creter—lively as a cricket, too—and a master-hand for work; no noise about it; and neat as a Shaker! Sixty years we saw the sun rise and set together—never apart one night in that time. Sixty years! It's a long day, Archy; but 'twas pleasurant, I tell you.” The old man paused, still leaning on his spade, and then went on to the second chapter of his life: “But an only child is choice, Archy—you was a speaking of Anny? Well, she 's gone, too! We wa'n't neither of us none of the youngest when Anny was born. She was all of thirty, and I was upwards. Anny was a comfort all the way through; she was good— she was, Archy; but after her mother died, I never see no creter so lonesome as she was. It was `Mother! mother!' all the time; and when the typhus fever set in, I couldn't say a word—she was going to mother, and I could best bear being left alone. My spirit is a kind o' rising one, you know, Archy; but it was a hard stroke parting.” The poor old man, with a nature all abhorrent of sadness as it was, bit his lips, and fairly whimpered. “It is very wretched, Uncle Phil, that you should be left alone.” “Oh, gorry! Archy, I ain't alone; that is, Ned Finley's family has moved in to t'other part of the house, and they 're good company, 'specially their boy Jemmy. Says he to me t'other day, when my rheumatis was at its height, and I could not put on my shoes, says he, `Come, Uncle Phil, come to dancing-school with me, and it will cure you.' He's a bright one.” And the old man, who had glided into sunshine as eagerly as a lizard does, laughed, and went on: “I always liked boys, you know, Archy; you and I was always friends, you remember?” “Oh, I can never forget it, Uncle Phil, how kind you always were to me—the mammoth melon you gave me, and my pleasant rides in your old wagon. Is old Whitey alive?” “Whitey! Landsakes! Archy. Whitey died twenty years ago, and he was upwards of twenty-two! I was not thinking, Archy, of our little sprees in the old wagon, and so forth, but of your ploughing; do you remember it?” Uncle Phil proceeded to relate what he repeated circumstantially at his semi-annual meetings with Archibald, for he never went home without paying the old man a visit. “You remember, don't you, Archy, when we raised that noble bit of corn that took the premium—before you went into larning? You was but a slip of a boy, but you was one of them kind that succeeds. Gorry! there 's a difference in boys, that 's a fact. When you took the ten dollars instead of the silver cup, Deacon Shay's wife said `she thought it a bad sign for a boy to be so greedy of cash.' I tell you, Archy, I had my revenge when I went to settle with her for burying the deacon. The old lady disputed my price—you know the deacon was tall as Saul, and I had to dig extra length. Well, I told her, twice over, how you would have me take the ten dollars, 'case you would have it the yield was owing to my ploughing—you remember?” “You will not let me forget, Uncle Phil, though it is so long past; even then you seemed to me an old man.” “'Case you was a boy, Archy. Why, it ain't much over twenty years, and I was not much past sixty then—but old age has come on me like a snow-storm since she and Anny died.” “Still, I see you are able to keep up your old business?” “Well, yes, with some help. Since railroads came in, Archy, people are running wild with notions. They must carry new fashions into grave-yards, and turn 'em into cimetaries, and there 's a sight to do! But come here, Archy, and see where I laid my folks.” Archibald followed him. “There,” he continued, after a slight pause, “there they lie together, side by side, as close as we could put them. I always meant to lie by her, but Anny went first, and I gave up to her. I knew she 'd want to lie close to `mother'—so she'll lie between us. Now, isn't that sleek, Archy?” he pointed to the smooth, rich turf over his wife and child. “I spare no pains here,” and he stooped to pluck out the only weed visible, “it's all I can do for them now; the ladies put up this monument—it was kind of them, but I guess father's work pleases them that lies under better—foolish, they don't know nothing about it.” And our poor “Old Mortality” dashed off the tears that seemed to sting him. “Oh I think they do, Uncle Phil; not from `under,' as you say, but I believe they are looking down upon you, lovingly, gratefully.” “Gorry! do you, Archy? do you? Well, maybe they are.” Uncle Phil's garrulity did not tire Archy, to whom he was much endeared by the pleasant memories of his boyhood, but anxious lest the falling dew should harm his stiffened joints, he told him so, and proposed they should go homeward. “Oh, never fear, Archy. I never humor my rheumatis—there 's no use. I want you just to notice your plot. You were too much cut down at the funeral. The trees you planted thrive finely. I have my favorites below, as others have above ground. You can pick them out by the look of their graves; no nettles where your people lie, I can tell you.” They turned their footsteps towards the fresh grave, and having examined the young trees which encircled the sacred precincts of his family, and commended them, Archibald, for the first time in his life, noticed a grave beside his mother's, the turf of which was very slightly elevated above the surrounding level. It had a small brown head-stone. “Whose grave is this, so close to my mother's, can you tell me, Uncle Phil?” he said. “Tell you, Archy? I guess I can,” replied the old man, chuckling. “Why, since they've been modeling-over the yard, I've 'dentified more than forty graves that had no name on 'arth, but what's in my mind—there's not many folks remembered long after they come under my spade. I was puzzled myself sometimes, but then I'd call to mind the shape of the coffin, the kind of wood, and sometimes, Archy, the look of a mourner would come up fresh, and bring it all back. But that little grave—landsakes, Archy! to think you should not know about that.” “I do not,” said Archibald, his feelings startled by the old man's emphasis and by his face full of meaning. “Why, Archy, that's Helen Dale's grave—your aunt.” “Helen Dale! my aunt? I never heard the name before. I never knew I had an aunt.” “Why, you don't mean so, Archy!” and the old man bent over his spade, and gazed at Archy in a sort of bewilderment. After a moment's pause, he said, “Well, maybe it is not so strange. Come to think, she must have died about the time you were born—a little before, or may be a little after; and your own mother, Archy, was—was—was—was not like other folks. That is all I mean, Archy—no disrespect—for she was a noble disposition of a woman, and your mother besides; but she was the shut-uppest woman that ever I came across. `Deeds, not words,' with her; but the last comer, that is the present Mrs. Lisle, has made up for it. Gorry! her tongue is set in the middle, and runs at both ends.” “Still,” said Archibald, reflecting more than listening, “I wonder my father never mentioned my aunt to me.” “Well, he was rather of a still man too, Archy; and the last woman was so breezy, he could scarce hear his own quiet voice. No; it's not strange, you was not over eight when your own mother died, and Helen Dale was only your aunt, and your mother pined inwardly; she was inclining to stern too, your mother. But come, let's be going toward home.” “I do not remember,” said Archibald, following, after he had given one last, loving, lingering look to the sods that covered poor Letty, “I do not remember that my mother was stern.” “Well not to you, Archy, nor to Helen Dale. She was more child than sister to your mother—ten or twelve years between them; and Helen was the apple of her eye, the meekest, mindingest little creter; she was pretty! Your mother was married so long before you was born, that no one mistrusted she would ever have a child, and Helen was all in all to her. And your mother was ambitious, she knew a'most every thing. She had been a teacher, you know, and folks thought she over-teached Helen. She grew up as white as a water-lily—a real beauty, and her eyes just a pretty match for yours; she did not seem made out of common clay, Archy, she did not. She went away that spring before she died, to the sea-shore for her health. When she first came home, she looked chirp, but she soon ran down, and went as consumptive folks mostly do, at the fall of the leaf. It was just after you were born, and your mother would have the coffin brought up in her room where she was lying, and you, a little black-looking fellow along side of her. We placed the coffin across the table that stood under the glass, so that the head came close to your mother's pillow, and she raised up in the bed and told us to put back the lid. Helen made the beautifullest corpse I ever saw. She had long, light, shining hair, like your's, Archy, when you was a boy; and 'twas parted off her forehead, and brought down each side on her shoulders, in a clump of kind o' wavy curls. Your mother would not have a cap put on her, nor a shroud on, but her own white dress with a narrow ruffle, showing just the pretty modest part of her neck; she looked like a child asleep; she was not much past sixteen; her eyelids laid quiet down just as if she was dreaming something pleasant, and her long eye-lashes soft and black, seemed to stir when you looked at her. She was a pictur to look at, I tell you, Archy.” “But my mother, Uncle Phil?” “Well, I was going to tell you. Your mother was a different make from Helen: a tall, strong-build, but she was dreadful took down. She did not seem to know what she was about; she took you up in her arms and held you on the pillow as if you could see into the coffin, and knew 'twas your aunt, and so forth; your poor little head lopped one side and t'other, and what did you take in? and then she put you back and ris' up in bed, and laid her arms on the coffin, and her head went quite down in, and I saw her neck swelled as if it would burst, and the veins along her temples, and not a word she spoke, nor a tear she shed; and I knew all this was resky to a woman in her situation, and that she had ought to live for the sake of her baby—that's you, Archy; so says I, `Mis' Lisle, ma'am, this won't do,' and I takes her by the shoulders, and lays her down, and she threw the bed-clothes over her head, and I called help, and we brought down the coffin and set it under the old elm-tree in the yard, and they had the prayer there, and there was no dry eyes, I tell you, Archy. I kind o' shuddered when I laid the sods over her; so young—sixteen and seven months —and so pretty, Archy,” concluded the old man, with a sigh. Archy was infected by the sexton's vivid recollections; he, too, shuddered. After a moment's silence he asked Uncle Phil if he could tell him no more of his mother. “Well, not much, Archy. Before this time she'd been a dreadful ambitious woman. Every thing of Mis' Lisle's was better than the neighbors had, and all her make. But after Helen died, she seemed to give up the world pretty much; they said Mis' Lisle's butter and cheese wa'n't better than other folks'. She seemed not to care much for any thing but you; not but what she did her duty as a wife, but her heart was half in Helen's grave, and t'other half you had.” “I remember her,” said Archy, “as pale, and thin, and sad, and it seems to me she was a long time ill.” “A failing? yes, Archy, she was. The very last time she was out, was the summer Deacon Shay died. She was at the funeral; I obsarved she did not go out with the procession, and I was sleecking off the deacon's grave. She beckoned to me; she was a standing at Helen's head-stone. Since Helen's burial a good many of your father's relations had dropped off, and she was kind o' hedged in among 'em; and so says your mother, says she, `Uncle Phil, you must bury me under that oak-tree yonder, and mind when you do it, that you take up my sister's coffin, and place her close beside me, and move this head-stone.' `I shall do it, ma'am,' says I; and I did it, Archy, no mistake. Your mother died, and was buried that following September, and the next day I moved Helen; and now comes something remarkable: She'd lain eight years bating fifteen days, and she looked just precisely as she did the day I put her down, not a hair moved, not a shade changed, even the little white plaited muslin ruffle round her neck laid just as pretty. I've seen a great deal in our old grave-yard, but never the like o' that.” They had now reached the gate that led to the sexton's dwelling. “Well, good-by, Archy,” he said, returning the cordial grasp of his young friend's hand. “I've had a pleasant time with you, though it's a solitary business that brings you here. One thing, Archy, no offence. I took kind o' comfort in putting Letty down a side of Helen; young folks together, you know; it seems sort o' company for them.” “Uncle Phil!” “Well, Archy, you can't, I see, enter into my sense of it, but I have lived so much in the grave-yard, that all my folks there that I have buried and seen to, and so on, seem to me about as living as any body. Landsakes, Archy! it's a kind of a confused world, after all!” And so it seemed to Archibald, as he slowly retraced his steps homeward, brooding on what he had heard from the old sexton, so much, and yet so little of what he longed to know of his mother. He had now reached the old house on the hill-side, where Letty was first introduced to our readers, no longer seeming the old house; but repaired, repainted, and refurnished by the fruits of the New York lawyer's hard work, it afforded to his father's widow and her children, a most comfortable and happy home. And as Archibald sat surrounded by his brothers, who had all come home for the mournful occasion of the day, and saw them bright with intelligence, and good, and affectionate—the result of the combined necessities and opportunities of our New England youth; the opportunities for the most part supplied by Archibald—he felt that life, however checkered by disappointments, has healthy excitements and sweet consolations, so long as duty is its aim, and affection its stimulant. The tea was over, a tea more luxurious, but not attended with less bustle or less clatter from his step-mother, than that which preceded his father's death, when Mrs. Lisle's domestic brought Archibald a letter, the writing covering three and a half sides of a foolscap sheet. “Poor Archy!” exclaimed one of the younger Lisles, “there's Dr. Bay again! I wonder if he ever let you rest one day at home, without sending you one of his everlasting letters, as long as Paul's epistle to the Romans. But what is that paper inside, Archy?” Archibald unfolded it: “A certificate of the date of my birth; the careful doctor has always an eye to possible exigences.” He refolded it, and the letter also, without even glancing at that, and added, “It will keep till I have leisure to read it. It probably concerns some ancient landmark, or disputed boundary; we shall miss the doctor when he dies, as much as we should the county records, if they were all burned.” Lisle put the letter into his pocket, which, at no distant date, was to be worth to him all the “county records.” The door-bell again rang, and another letter was brought to Lisle. “See, boys,” said his mother, “what it is to be a New York lawyer.” The letter contained a telegraphic despatch, and in the course of an hour Lisle was in the express mail train for New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “The day cometh when she who has made the wretched her children, shall be hailed `Mother,' and she who has forgotten or ill-performed her duty to her children, shall be written childless.” True to his dinner hour, six o'clock, Walter Herbert was slowly mounting the steps to his sister-in-law's house, with that heavy-heartedness one feels when there is no face within the door one cares to see, no voice one cares to hear. “This house is a tomb to me,” he murmured—old people have a trick of soliloquizing—“I now have always a bad taste in my mouth when I come near it.” As he rang the door-bell, a hackney-coach drove up, its door was opened, and a young lady in a gray dress, a straw bonnet, and blue veil, and a Russia-leather traveling sack on her arm—a railroad costume —alighted, and running up the steps asked the servant, who answered Mr. Herbert's ring, with much earnestness in her tone, “if Miss Grace Herbert were at home?” “No, miss,” answered John, and was shutting the door on the inquirer, his manner being rather addressed to the shabby coach than to her. Some of our servants naturalize the insolence of older civilizations with wonderful facility. The young person's tone touched Uncle Walter's soft heart. He put John aside, and opening wide the door, asked “If she wished to speak with Miss Herbert.” “I do, very much,” she replied, with a simplicity that won a smile from the dear old man, and casting her veil aside, she added, “Do you expect her in soon, sir?” “No, not soon, nor till to-morrow evening, unless you will give me your name, and let me summon her. I think she will come at your bidding,” he added, as he gazed in the sweet and troubled face of the stranger. She was just deciding to accept the kindness, when Miss Carlton's splendid carriage drove up, and the liveried coachman motioned to the miserable Irish driver of the hack to give place. He drew off. The modest little stranger's eye encountered the supercilious stare of Miss Carlton, and dropping her veil, and saying, “It's no matter, sir, I won't trouble you,” she glided down the steps, and giving a direction to the coachman, drove away. While he obeyed her order, Walter Herbert despatched the following note:—“Dearest Grace, come home forthwith. There has just been a distressed little damsel here inquiring for you. She is a tight-built, trig lass, with a dainty little mouth and lips, that an old man would love to kiss; and an eye like a star dropped from the firmament, and blue as that; and so light and fleet of foot, that as she sprang into the carriage, I cried aloud, `Give me back my youth.' I should not wonder if she were your little friend, Alice Clifford. She looked at me as if she half knew me for your Uncle Walter.” We must precede the slow coach to its destination in Wall-street, and enter Mr. Lisle's office where one clerk asked another who was rummaging tables and pigeon-holes, “What he was searching for?” “I am looking for the note brought by the policeman on Monday; it is not in the letter-box; it is not anywhere. Mr. Lisle may return at any moment, and nothing vexes him like a missing paper.” “You need not tell him it's missing. It came from some poor devil in the Tombs, who is probably disposed of by this time.” “No, that he is not. His messenger has been here three times to-day; he was here an hour ago, and sulked, and said he should not take the trouble to come again.” “Why did you not ask the name of the person who sent him?” “I did, and he said that was just what he did not know; `the name was to the note, he supposed.' ” “Ah, well, it's some gent of the upper ten got into a scrape, who expects Mr. Lisle to get him out, and keep his incognito. Let him take his chance. Come, sit down, Slidell, and let a fellow pursue his studies.” Slidell looked over the student's shoulder, and seeing him deep in the “last new novel,” gave an expressive a-hem, and returned to his own desk, and probably to some “study” equally recondite. But our young students were not destined to remain quiet at their learned researches. The door was ajar, a light footstep was heard, and the rustling of a petticoat, an unaccustomed sound in these resorts, followed by an eager tap at the door. Their “Come in,” was answered by the appearance of the young traveler already described. She paused on the threshold, and looked eagerly around, as if in quest of some person not present. The young men started to their feet, and stood awaiting the first word. It was uttered with intense earnestness: “Is Mr. Lisle here?” “No; he is out of town.” “When is he expected?” “He may come to-morrow; perhaps not for some days. He left his return uncertain. We could hasten it by a letter.” There was a pause, evidently a mental deliberation; a conclusion. “Is he on a telegraph line?” she asked. “No, he is in some obscure village, not far from Boston.” VOL. II. 6 “Has Mr. Lisle no friend in Boston whose name you know?” “No; none.” “No business-correspondent?” “Oh, yes. You know, Slidell? Judson Bates, Esq.” “That may do. Will you be kind enough to give me pen, ink, and paper?” She wrote:—“Mr. Bates, please send an express to Mr. Archibald Lisle, requesting him to return to New York without delay, on important business of my brother's. “Alice Clifford.” She then requested one of the young gentlemen to take the note to the telegraph office; and after giving him money to pay for it, she went with such swiftness down the long steep stair-case, that Slidell, who followed her with the intention of offering to escort her through the questionable purlieus of Wall-street, just reached the outer steps in time to hear her tell her coachman to “drive to the Tombs.” “Thunder! that's a girl, Jem,” said he, returning to the office. “A go-ahead, you mean, Slidell; but somehow I don't fancy a girl, though she be so very pretty, with such a business way.” “Oh, I know you don't. You like a girl compounded of amiability, docility and imbecility, like the heroine of that story you are reading, who never had a thought of her own, or an independent action; a sort of `lean to' to the noble structure, man. One of your sort, if she has soft blue eyes, or brown waving tresses, if she be blonde or brunette, has dimpled hands, and delicate feet; why, she'll do to stand on a pedestal, and be worshiped till she's twenty, but she'd be a devil of a drag for a wife. Now this peerless little stranger is in some sort of a strait, there's no mistake; but if there's a way out she'll find it. How direct was her aim; how every word told! Would it have occurred to your kind of girl that a telegraph must be paid for? The deuce of a dollar could you and I have raised between us after last night's spree at Delmonico's. I am for women using the faculties Heaven has bestowed on them.” “There's sense in what you say Slidell, but heaven defend us from Women's Rights women!” “Amen and amen to that.” While the young men were giving a brush to a much-vexed question, Alice Clifford was pursuing her way through the dusky twilight to the Tombs. It was a drizzling, dirty evening. A feeble light from the lamps struggled through the foggy atmosphere; crowds of men were hurrying homeward from the business quarter. Overburdened women were carrying or dragging along lagging children, and here and there a drabbish-looking outcast, a frightful vestige of womanhood, crouched against a wall. Omnibuses and vehicles of all sorts were in a crush, their wearied drivers shouting and swearing. Alice sunk back in her seat, after for a moment curiously eyeing, through the misty window of her coach, a scene so new to her. “Oh, what a dreadful place!” she exclaimed, “how can people live here? There is not a hut, or shed in Mapleton that I would not rather have than a palace here! Oh, my poor brother in a prison in a city, itself a prison! How slow he drives; I shall be too late!” But the coach was soon extricated from the crowd, and driven at a fair pace down Leonard-street to the Tombs, the prison so called from its resemblance to its gloomy Egyptian model. Alice heaved a deep sigh as her eye ran over it from turret to foundation-stone. “Shall I wait, Miss?” asked the coachman, as she was taking from her purse the money to pay the unconscionable fee the fellow demanded. After hesitating for an instant, for her calculations for the night had not gone beyond her meeting with her brother, she gave a decided negative, and was pressing on from the dreary outside to the more fearful inside, when her steps were arrested by the whimpering of her dog, a little Blenheim spaniel, who had leaped out of the coach before her, and made a spring upon the heels of a man passing. He turned and gave the little animal a blow with his cane, that sent him back howling to his mistress' feet. “Poor Pixie!” she said, taking him caressingly in her arms. His cries continued, and brought out of a small room adjoining the entrance, a little woman, who, asking what had happened, the coachman replied, pointing to the man just turning the corner into Centre-street, “'Twas that brute, he struck the lady's dog.” “Oh, I know the fellow,” said the woman, looking after him. “Do you, ma'am?” said Alice, earnestly, as if she too recognized him; “what is his name?” “I don't recall his name; I'm poor on names; he's always haunting round here to see his comrades who get in, when he's lucky enough to keep out. You were wanting some one perhaps, Miss?” added the woman, with an official air, tempered with kindness. “Yes, ma'am; I wish to see the keeper of the prison.” “The keeper, my dear? Why there's ever so many keepers here. There's the head-keeper, Mr. Edson, and ever so many underlings, and there's myself that looks after the women; do you want any thing of me?” “Oh, yes; above all things I want some kind woman to help me.” The little woman nodded, as if to say, “That's me!” and Alice felt her heart revive as she looked into her new friend's face, and inferred the capabilities indicated in her keen humorous eye, her ruddy cheek, and a pleasant smile that expressed a benevolence which even the uses of her revolting office could not stale. She had a firmly knit strong frame, sturdy and short, and Alice felt like a frightened little bird, ready to cower under a strong wing. “My name, young lady,” she said, showing her into the small receiving-room, “is Juliana C. Barton; sit down and make yourself comfortable—a light heart's a small burden, as I tell my folks when I put them in the `Black Maria,' or boat them for Sing Sing.” “Comfortable” was a word just then struck out of Alice's vocabulary. She remained standing, and inquired if Mrs. Barton were acquainted with the male prisoners? “No, my child, I know nothing about them. I used to have a kind of curiosity to see murderers and gentlemen defaulters, but they are so common now-a-days that I am 'come indifferent.” “Have you heard of a young man, committed on Saturday, for a—a forgery?” “La, no, my dear; that happens every day.” “There was a young man so committed. How am I to find him?” “Oh, that's `as easy as sinning,' as I say to my ladies. We must go to Edson; he'll look into his records for a pretty young lady, when he would n't lift a finger for an old one; but that's men's ways, you know. You won't mind going through the `five days quarter,' it's the shortest cut.” Alice would not have shrunk from the “shortest cut,” were it through purgatory, to her object. Mrs. Barton, taking a ponderous key from her waist, unlocked the door that led into a long corridor, with staircases on one side and cells on the other, story above story to the top of the building. It is in this, the “five days quarter,” that the human offal of the city is every morning emptied. Alice's quick eye took in a new sense of human depravation. She groaned aloud, as she looked around upon the miserable wretches, some sitting singly, sullen, shivering against the stone-wall, some gossiping in groups, and some lying where they had been thrown, on mattresses in the cells, still steeped in intoxication, and all in dirt and rags, and branded with the grossest vices. Alice gathered her garments close around her, and clinging to Mrs. Barton, begged her to hurry through the place. “Poor child; it's something new to you, but there's no use in feeling,” said the habituée; “you see they don't much mind it.” She paused as a woman brushed by them, just brought in from a scene of riot, which she was coarsely caricaturing to an acquaintance, while her own little boy was filching pennies out of her pocket. “That woman,” said Mrs. Barton, lowering her voice, “is Adèle de Russe, alias Sally Tomkins. 'Tis not six years since I saw her riding, fine as the finest of fine ladies, with Sam Belson.” “Oh,” said Alice, “I never heard of her; I never heard of Sam Belson; please, ma'am, let us go on.” “Yes, yes. I thought you might have some curiosity; but I see you don't know much of city doings. I'd like to show Sally as she is to that mother and daughter that I saw yesterday chatting so soft and so friendly with Belson, at their carriage door before Stewart's shop. A decent lady should not let the hem of her gown brush the skirts of the coat of such as he! If they saw what I see! my! There's a difference between men and women, that's a fact: there's Sally and there's he! but come to the upshot, there'll not be a pin's head to choose between them; if any thing, I'd rather stand in her shoes than his, at the judgment; there will be a cloud of witnesses against such as he, thieves and murderers they are!” While Mrs. Barton was thus evolving the wisdom she had distilled from her observation of penal life, and carrying her analogies from the police-court to a higher tribunal, they had passed through the prison-yard, and re-entered at the mens' department. “Well done, little young lady!” she exclaimed, as they turned from Edson's office, with the permit to visit the young man in “cell No. 30,” “you are a trump! Why, if the Mayor, and the Ten Governors to boot, were to come into Edson's office, he would not hush up, and go straight to the business in hand, as he did for you; his tongue is—well, it's like the sea, never still. Stay a minute, Tim,” she continued, to the turnkey whom she had summoned to unlock No. 30, “we must arrange before you go in. I would not like,” she lowered her voice, “to leave you in the care of the men—they ain't all what they should be—” “Oh pray,” cried Alice, interrupting her, and feeling as if she should be maddened by another minute's delay, “let me go in—wait five minutes. Open the door, pray—” “Well—open it, Tim.” The turnkey obeyed. Alice sprang in. Mrs. Barton put her hand over the turnkey's to keep the door open, till she saw and heard the recognition. The words, “Dear sister!” “Poor Max!” the close, fond embrace, the burst of tears, satisfied her. She shut the door, and her voice trembled in sympathy, as she exclaimed, “All right, all right! The Lord forgive me, but I thought nothing short of a love-scrape would carry a girl straight ahead like that. And after all she's nothing but a sister! Well, a sister's love is always the same, and lasts to the end; that's the love for my money.” Our friend was only Mistress Barton by courtesy. “Come, come, little lady,” she called out, after restlessly walking up and down, “it's twice five minutes, and I must be going.” She re-opened the door, and her heart melted as she found Alice still sobbing on her brother's neck. “I am real sorry to break you off,” she said, “but I'm pushed for time. I must be in Williamsburg at eight, exact, at my niece's wedding; and before I go, I must see you safe on your way to your place.” “My place!” echoed Alice; “I have not any place.” “No place to go to! Such a sensible little lady as you, not to provide a place to go to.” “Oh, Mrs. Barton, I thought only of getting to my brother, and staying by him. Can't I stay here? Do let me.” “My dear, it's contrary to all rules. You can't—” “Can't you take me to your home, Mrs. Barton? I don't care for a bed. Let me sit in your parlor, lie on your floor, any thing.” “If I had a half hour to spare, my dear, I could take you to twenty decent places; but weddings won't wait. I'm after time now.” “Why not go to Miss Herbert, Alice?” asked her brother. “I have been there, Max; she is not at home, and I can't ask a favor of the ladies there. Is there not an empty room here, near my brother, Mrs. Barton, that I may occupy?” “Well, that is a proposition!” said Mrs. Barton, holding up both her hands. “Yes, my dear, we've empty rooms— we call 'em cells, but—” “But what? Are they not clean?” “They are whitewashed and scoured, soon's ever the tenant leaves.” “And can not I take the key and lock myself in?” “You can; but my! the thing was never heard of, that a feminine was locked up in the male department.” “Is there a rule against it?” “Well, no, I guess not. No rule against what no one ever thought of, but kind o' silent law.” “Then let it be silent, good Mrs. Barton. I am sure you can do what you like here, and no one will dare to find fault with you.” Mistress Barton was touched by this sagacious perception of her magisterial authority. “It's a new case,” she said; “but I think I may use my judgment. I see you are something out of the common way, young lady. Tim,” to the turnkey, “unlock No. 31.” The door was unlocked. Mrs. Barton put her head in, and pronounced it “sweet as a nut.” “I'll just fix the bed for you,” she said; and was proceeding to arrange the iron bedstead that, with its mattress, was turned up against the wall, “Oh no, no, ma'am, please,” said Alice, “I will lie on the clean floor.” “If you're so partic'lar, miss,” said the turnkey, “there's a bran new rocking-chair, sent in yesterday for the gentleman that left for Sing-Sing—he never sot in it.” “So much the better,” thought Alice, and throwing her blanket-shawl over it, “there's my bed,” she said, and heartily thanking kind Mistress Barton, and agreeing with the turnkey that he should let her out of her brother's cell at his last round, she re-entered it, and was locked in; and Mrs. Juliana S. Barton wended her way through the prison, murmuring, “There's a girl for my money! She knows what she is about, and can take care of herself; and others, too, if need be—and so young, and so pretty! But she's as safe as if she had a legion of angels to see to her.” Wise and simple come to the same conclusion. “So dear to heaven is saintly chastity, That, when a soul is found sincerely so, A thousand liveried angels lackey her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She wrote:—“Mr. Bates, please send an express to Mr. Archibald Lisle, requesting him to return to New York without delay, on important business of my brother's. “Alice Clifford.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">6* CHAPTER X. “A first-rate business lad he was, but, like other bright lads, needed the careful eye of a senior, to guard him from the pit-falls he was exposed to.” —Amos Lawrence. By the liberal use of those appliances which do the work in our actual life, of wishing-caps and talismanic-rings in Eastern story, Alice procured, through the turnkey, that unspeakable consolation to lads of twenty and thereabouts— a good supper; and when her brother had eaten his oysters and drank his coffee, he, in his own phrase, “rose up a new man, and fit to live.” “Now, Alice, tell me,” he said, “how my mother took the news? I could not ask you till I got fortified.” “Dear Max, she has not yet got the news. She went on Monday morning to Boston.” “And you were at home alone? poor, dear little Alice!” “Oh, I was but too thankful that my mother was gone; and I trust she will hear nothing till we have consulted with Archibald Lisle. I have telegraphed to him, and I feel sure he will be here to-morrow.” “Then he is out of town—thank Heaven! I have sent, and sent to his office, and could get no answer. I thought he believed me guilty, and had given me up.” “No, he is not of that sort, Max.” “And did you come away without telling any one? You are the dearest, pluckiest little girl in the world.” “Yes, I consulted no one; but by this time—. You know how it is at Mapleton—give but the least ray of light, and their sharp eyes can read any riddle. I was at the Prescotts when the mail came in; Laura opened her paper, and the very first paragraph she saw she read aloud. It was to this effect, I can repeat it word by word: `A young man from Massachusetts was apprehended yesterday, for passing a forged check at the Manhattan Bank. As we hear he has respectable connections, we withhold his name for the present.'” “And so, I suppose, you wise young women of Mapleton jumped to the conclusion that I was the only clerk in New York from Massachusetts?” “Oh, Max, I know not what Laura and the rest did; they were all silent. My heart throbbed, and I made some pretext, and ran home through the garden. Your letter lay on the table—it was written on coarse, soiled paper.” “Yes, I remember, a sheet I got here in the office.” “Well, that boded no good. I sat, feeling very faint and wretched, five minutes before I had courage to open it.” “You did open it;—spare yourself the trouble of telling me the contents, as I had the pleasure of writing it.” “Ah, but dear Max,” said Alice, throwing her arm around her brother, and bursting afresh into tears, “you don't know what a comfort the last line in it was to me. Those blessed words: `I am innocent, mother; take my word for it.' Why, Max darling, they seemed to spread over the whole letter. So often have I heard dear mother in her different distresses about you—and you know they have occurred pretty often—so often have I heard her say `My boy is true. I take comfort in that, he never told me a lie.'” “I never did. I never was afraid to tell my mother the truth; but go on, Alice. Did you hate me for always getting you all into hot water? What did you think?” “I thought of nothing, but how I could best help you. I had no one to advise with. Cousin John, and Judge Bliss, were gone from Mapleton, and there were none but women left, and they were not wiser than I. So I resolved to come to you at once. I came off to meet the early train, leaving a cheerful note to Miss Laura, begging her to account as well as she could to the inquiring community of Mapleton for my absence.” Alice proceeded to relate the disappointments attending her visits to Miss Herbert, and at Lisle's office; and concluded with saying, “Now, dear Max, tell me the whole of your troubles from the beginning. I am afraid both you and Archy have kept us in the dark.” “No; but in the dusk, it may be, dear. I shall make a short story of it, for I am my own hero, and good for neither song nor sermon, neither bright enough for the one, nor black enough for the other.” “Well, dear Alice, you know, when I slumped at college, Archy got me a place in what is called one of the `most respectable houses in the city: Messrs. Beekwell, and Co.;' and so I suppose they are, and were, but a deuced bit did they care for us clerks beyond getting work out of us. But that did not matter to me so long as I had Archy. Alice, no brother could have done more for me—not our dear Arthur if he had been alive.” “Yes, Max, you wrote us about that—how he gave you up his sitting-room at his lodgings, for your bed-room.” “Oh, as to that, Alice, that was not half. And at first, I did not thank him much for that. I thought he meant to stand guard over me, and you know fellows don't like to be watched.” “Especially fellows that need watching, dear Max.” “A brush! Never mind, I deserve it. He soon made me forget that he was any thing but a dear friend and companion. He seldom went out himself—Archy was always a dig, you know—and so he did not know how much I pined for some pleasant houses to visit at. He did take me one evening to the Herberts, to introduce me to your friend. She was out, and that Miss Carlton and her mother treated me as if I had come into their drawing-room by mistake, and should, like any other poor devil of a clerk, have staid in the entry with my bill, or parcel. Miss Herbert was up to the mark, for she wrote me the next day a kind note, asking me to visit them sociably. Lord! I see myself going again, to have my blood simmering in my veins, as it did while I sat there—better blood than their's, with all their airs. Besides, Archy did not go often, himself.” “Did not go often to see Grace, before he went abroad? Are you sure, Max?” “Why, Alice, do you expect every body to worship your idol? Archy did not, any how. When I could get out of the store in any decent time, I always found him at our rooms, and he was so kind. When he was hard at work, and could not go out, he would have a pleasant book for me —you know I am not a deep reader, Alice—and if he were at leisure, he would propose going with me to a lecture, or to study over the Chinese curiosities, or to see a panorama; and now and then he took me to the opera, or the theatre, just enough to slake a fellow's thirst for such things; and sometimes we would drop into a saloon, and get an oyster supper, or an ice, or have a little jollification at home. Dear old Archy! he had not forgotten what it was to be a `young youth.'” “Forgotten! Archibald Lisle is not so very much older than you, Max.” “No; seven or eight years, though—but, Alice, that makes all the difference between the boy and the man; and I was a boy then; and heaven forgive me, have been more of a boy and a worse boy since. All went well enough till Archy got ill and dumpish and went abroad, and I was left to myself. Now, Alice, I am not good company to myself. I must have eye answering to eye, voice to voice, heart to heart, Alice; but to be alone—alone in this city of half a million, I could not stand it, and no heart of flesh could.” “But, surely, Max, you were introduced to Mr. Beekwell's family? You never told us you were not.” “No, my dear; for we don't tell things of course; but were you so green as to suppose that a mere clerk—a country lad—would be admitted by the grand Pachas of the city into their palaces! Neither Mr. Beekwell nor his partner could write a grammatical sentence, or spell ten consecutive words correctly, but they had mounted the golden rungs of their ladder to the very top, and there was a great gulf between them and their hard-working clerks.” “But, surely, Max, all merchants are not so to their clerks?” “Of course, Alice, not all. I know some that are like fathers to them, and that will be the best item of all, I guess, when they come to foot up their last accounts. But I tell you, Alice, the reason so many boys go astray, and are lost in this city is, because the `old gentleman' is left to fill up their idle time; and you see, Alice, they come fresh and innocent from their country homes; they long for some one to say even as much as `good-morning Sam,' or `good-night Tom;' they go to some lodging-house where no body cares for them, but to get their week's board, and they are sure to fall in with some scamp, as I did. I have seen enough of it.” The young people had both lingered on the threshold of Max's story, dreading to plunge into its darkest part. The poor lad now proceeded manfully. “Just after Archibald sailed, there came a fresh clerk into our establishment—Ernest Gilmore. He belonged to the `upper ten;' had been to one famous school after another, and had finally been boosted into the junior class in Columbia College, when he was set adrift and placed in the `respectable house of Messrs. Beekwell, and Co.,' where it was expected that hard work would break him in. Any one `can lead a horse to water,' you know, Alice, but all creation could not make `Gil,' as we called him, work. I need not go into particulars. He took a fancy to me. He was lively, and loved fun, and so did I—you know that is my speciality, and I can't help it. He had credit at tailors, and livery stables, and everywhere, for he was yet in his minority, and if he did not pay, his father would have to come down with the tin. I did not know all this, Alice, at the time; I would never have been a party to this plunder with my eyes open, nor did I know when he passed his minority. By this time he had pretty thoroughly inoculated me with his passion for fast horses, and fast doings in general. Don't open your eyes so wide, and look so scared, my dear little sister. I give you my word that I never went to any place that I would hesitate to tell you of. No, there I made a stand, or rather there stood my mother and you, and hedged up the road to temptation that way. Do you remember, Alice, when you and I were little children, on our knees, saying our prayers to mother, that she asked us to promise her that we would never in our whole lives omit repeating, each day, that first prayer we learned: `Our Father, etc.'” “Yes, indeed, I do.” “And how solemn and sweet she seemed, and with tears in her eyes, and all that; well, we made the promise, you know; and now honor bright, Alice, I do believe that nothing short of a miracle would have made such a head-over-heels fellow, as I, keep such a promise; but I have kept it. That little prayer, Alice, covers the whole ground.” “So I think, dear Max.” “I know it has brought me short up many a time, for, Alice, to tell the whole truth, while Archy was in Europe, I led a pretty fast, risky life; and it was no wise strange that the first thing he heard after he came home, was from Beekwell and Co., that I must lose my place there. He set to work, like a good fellow, and got me another, far better. I should have been thrown out but for him. He made himself responsible to Messrs. Eaton and Smith for my good conduct. They have treated me like gentlemen—that is as if I were a gentleman. And truly, Alice, fearing that you and my mother would be made miserable by my misconduct, and feeling what I owed to Archy, I have, for the last six months, strained every rope in the ship; but they would, once in a while, get slack—a fellow can't walk a crack forever, Alice; and Gilmore was forever haunting about me, and as I found, now, when we had a spree, I had to pay the fiddler, which he had done while he could, it seemed mean always to back out. Still I did not go with him often. If I had not the fear of Archy before my eyes, I had the love of him, which is better. All this last ten months Gil has been borrowing money of me—two or three dollars at a time, sometimes five, and up to ten. While I had a penny, could I refuse him, after he had been so lavish to me? But, oh, Alice! you've no notion how like lightning a man goes, when he begins to slide down hill. Last week, on Tuesday, he came to me, and said he, `Well, I have been reckoning up all my small debts to you, and I find, to my astonishment, I owe you seventy-five dollars.' It did not astonish me, for I had been as bare as a picked chicken. `Luckily,' said he, `I have the means to pay the debt,' and he put into my hands a draft on the Manhattan Bank, made out in my favor, by Charles Innes of Boston, to the amount of five hundred dollars. I started, and he said, `Happy dog! am I not? Old Aunt Sukey is dead, and this Charles Innes, her executor, wrote me she had left me this legacy of five hundred dollars. So, desiring that my various creditors should not get wind of this blessed windfall, that I might save it from the sharks, and pay it to the honest fellows like you, I wrote to said Innes to forward me the money by a draft in your favor. He did so—I have an appointment to go up to Albany with my father at three o'clock (it was then half-past two); if you will step round to the bank, and get the money, take out your dues, and just hand me the balance, we shall be all fair and square. I have an errand for my father at the Metropolitan, and will meet you between there and here.' I did not, for an instant, think of foul play. I was too glad at the prospect of getting back my money. I presented the draft, met Gilmore, paid him the balance, obtained leave of a day's absence from Messrs. Eaton and Smith, ran off to my lodgings, and was packing my carpet-bag in a prodigious fluster of joy to run up to Yonkers, and visit a friend, who had invited me, and who (between you and me, Alice,) has the prettiest sister in Christendom, when there was a fearful ring of the door-bell, an ominous sound in the entry, and without knocking, without leave or licence, a policeman entered my room, and politely laying his hand upon me, said he would change the address of my luggage to the Tombs. I was aghast, and did not even surmise whence the blow came, till he told me my fraud was discovered a half hour after I left the bank. He examined my person and my effects for the money, and found the seventy-five dollars in my purse. I protested my innocence, of course, but he only smiled and said, `humbug! we are used to all that, young man.' I begged him not to disgrace me by a commitment, and told him I had a friend who, I was sure, would be my bail. The fellow had some bowels, and he waited for an answer to a note I sent to Archy. Archy was gone, as you know, and every thing went against me. And so I was brought here, as they say, `duly committed.'” “Why, in the world, Max, did you not send for Mr. Eaton or Mr. Smith, and tell them how it was?” “That's you, dear Alice; you always think of the right thing to be done. Well, my child, I was stunned. I was in a hot fever all night. I could think of nothing but my mother and you. I did not eat a morsel, not even when breakfast time came (mirabile!), but your rational thought did at last, some time this morning, come into my head, and I despatched a note to Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith was out of town. Eaton is in Europe. The head-clerk came round to me; I told him the whole story. He did not half believe me; you know how it is with some stupid people—if a man is accused and put in prison, they think he is as good as convicted. However, he did go up to Gilmore, and came back, having seen both Gilmore and his father. Gil denied having seen me for a week, and expressed the most perfect astonishment at my story. His father said they had had no intention of going to Albany, and that his son had dined at home on Tuesday as usual, and spent the evening at home. So Davis, the clerk, said I could do nothing further without a lawyer's advice, hoped I should be able to clear myself, said business pressed, and left me, Alice; that's the way with the world, my dear!” “Oh, I hate the world, Max.” Alice's faith in her brother was implicit, but her heart sickened when she found he had not a shadow of evidence to substantiate his innocence before a legal tribunal. Younger than Max, and albeit of the weaker sex, she had more clearness and sedateness of judgment than her brother, and less of that quality which she called buoyancy, and others might term levity. After pondering for a while gloomily on Max's relation, she naturally exclaimed, “What a horrid hardened wretch that Gilmore must be!” “Well, Alice, not quite such a hardened wretch as you think. Scampish he is, but there is not much to him; he is more of the weak, than the wicked. He has had a poor bringing up. His father and mother are nothing but rich. They thought, I suppose, that their grand house, and carriage, and horses, and so on, would make Gil a gentleman; but you know all that won't begin to do it. No, Gil is not so bad as some; there 's shades in fellows, Alice. Gil got hooked in with an old stager, who dragged him down—a rascally blackguard of an Irish gentleman.” Alice had heard of one such individual in her sheltered world, and but one, and she asked with some eagerness his name. “His name,” Max replied, “is Maltby, Hugh Maltby.” “Hugh Maltby!” echoed Alice. “Why, yes, my child—Hugh Maltby; surely you never heard of the fellow before? What in the world makes you color so?” “Color! Did I color, Max? I am tired and nervous to-night.” “That is not it, sister dear. Come, you are not good at evasions. Tell me what you know of Hugh Maltby.” “I can not tell you, Max. Don't ask me.” “I won't, Alice; but I can't think what you can know about that wretch. I believe he is at the bottom of this plot. Gil owed him a gambling debt, and he was afraid of him. He is a dare-devil. I heard him threaten to shoot some relation of his children, their uncle, or something of that sort.” Alice became now deadly pale. She averted her face, poured a draught of water into a glass, and swallowed it. “You are tired and nervous, I believe,” continued Max. “Let's drop the curtain on our miseries, till Archy comes to help us. Tell me about Mapleton. How is dear mother, just the same?” “Yes, just, Max,” replied his sister, breathing a deep sigh, as she thought the news of her darling boy would turn her hair gray. “Oh, don't fall into the blues again, Alice. How are Tom Thumb and Brancus—alive?” “Yes, indeed, and flourishing; mother surfeits them, but still calls them `Max's pests.'” “And Blossom—does he still purr around the table, and mother drop him tit-bits, furtively?” “Yes, Max.” “And mother still uses carving-knives, instead of bolts, for the outer doors? and gives old John a hundred dollars a year, for `doing chores' he can't do? Poor mother, she's great on pensions.” “She is great at every mode of charity. Has she written you about the paralytic child she is taking care of?” This announcement, which Alice had been for some minutes studying how to interject into their discourse, did not, as she expected, produce a sensation. Max smiled, said, “Just like mother,” and went on. “Is Mapleton the same heaven as usual, Alice? No marriages? No engagements? Neither of the charming Prescotts going off, nor Charlotte Platt, nor the Days?” “No, none of them.” “Not a `Singleton' missing from `Singleside' in the last year! I told them so; they seem to look on us men as an elegant superfluity.” Thus the poor lad rattled on, partly taxing his manhood to be as heroic as possible, and partly following the natural bent of his careless disposition: Cushioned round with love, the evening glided away in that dismal place. Now and then Alice, disturbed by the foreshadowings of revenges dire that might be done by a bold, bad man, and of “trial” and “sentence,” would start or shiver, which Max noticing, he would kiss her cheek, and draw her closer to him. At nine the turnkey's knock announced their separation for the night. They asked for a reprieve, but the man was peremptory. “We've already stretched a point,” he said; “we must use our private judgments sometimes.” Our officials are very apt to respect this “higher law.” “I can see,” he added, as he gave Miss Clifford a lamp, and the key that she might turn the bolt on the inside, “when people is honorable, and can be trusted with a privilege.” Alice locked her door, and having arranged her little affairs for the night, she sat down in the rocking-chair, made a desk of her lap, and began a letter to her mother. Her courage was nerved by the strangeness of her position. Courage she had to face any danger in her brother's cause, and resolution to conquer any conquerable difficulty. That there could be any danger to freeze the blood in her young veins within the walls of her cell, had not even occurred to her, and when she turned her bolt she felt as secure as the commander of an impregnable fortress; yet within that narnow space, she was to encounter an enemy more fearful to her than the wild beasts of Ephesus. “Great giants work great wrongs, but we are small.” The noise of steps and bolting of doors along the passages had ceased; there was no sound but that of her sharp gold pen, when she was startled by an ominous noise, and starting up, she saw—not one, nor two, nor three, but, as she afterward averred, a drove of mice, careering over the bed, jumping to the floor, and there disporting themselves, native and happy citizens! No poor wretch in an Indian jungle, confronting a tiger, could have been more terrified than our hitherto intrepid little Alice. She sprang on her feet into the chair; the rockers were treacherous—over it went, chair, lamp, ink, Alice, and all! It was now utter darkness, and luckily quiet, too. The little habitués were frightened back to their holes by the sudden turmoil, and Alice, making an effort of heroism equal to St. George's, in his contest with the dragon, or to any other saint's with any other monster, groped around until she recovered her lamp, and relighted it from a match in her sack. What was next to be done? In a lion's den, or a fiery furnace, she might have looked for miraculous intervention; but now she must trust to her own right arm—to that poor trembling arm. A rattan in the corner of the cell caught her eye, she seized this weapon, and intrenching herself in the chair in a posture which those who have seen female belligerents engaged in this warfare will picture to themselves, she girded herself for the battle. For a while she kept the enemy in their entrenchments by a steady tattooing with the cane, but its sound soon became as familiar to them as the snorings of the last denizen of the cell, and they issued forth, rank and file. To any one of the male sex their gambols, their glidings, and leapings might have been amusing, but there is enmity set between mice and womankind, and to Alice they seemed a host of malignants, magicians, monsters! To touch their soft hairy sides, even with her cane, was a horror, but by deftly plying that she kept them at arm's length. She changed the cane from wearied hand to hand. The night seemed interminable, and reference to her watch alone convinced her that it was “but eleven,” “but twelve,” “but one,” “but two!” Sleep, the surest of youth's allies, at last came to her relief; her tired, aching arms fell, no longer obedient to her will, and the will itself (for so say the sages is its nature) fell asleep, and the enemy had it all their own way; and while poor Alice's brain was perturbed with visions of leviathans and mastodons, they ran up to her shoulders, leaped into her lap, and performed divers antics, till one, crossing her bare throat in quest of a crumb from her supper that had lodged on the hem of her collar, she started up to a fresh consciousness of the horrors of her condition. But now sounds of the restless city's life penetrated from without to her cell; and as “Hope springs eternal in the human breast,” hope that she might live to tell the tale dawned on Alice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. “Our youth, our childhood, that spring of springs, 'Tis surely one of the blessedest things, That nature ever invented.” “Beautiful is the light and pleasant to behold!” and never did it seem to Alice so beautiful, so pleasant to behold, as when, brightening the world, it stole slowly and dimly into her cell. The little doers of evil deeds had shrunk away into darkness; and yet she waited, and listened two mortal hours before she heard the sound of footsteps in the corridor. But she did hear them, and hearing her own name pronounced, she sprang to the door, turned the bolt, and rushing out, confronted—Archibald Lisle! Pardon her, fastidious reader—the truth must be told— “Oh, Archy!” she exclaimed, and throwing her arms around his neck, she clung to him as to a dear brother, who had brought her comfort and help; then, as suddenly retreating, she covered her blushing face with both hands, and stammered out apologetically, “I forgot myself—I have been so dreadfully terrified!” “Terrified!” exclaimed Lisle, looking fiercely at the turnkey, “who has molested you?” Poor Alice hesitated, and in one breath made the short passage from the sublime to the ridiculous, answering in the feeblest, meekest tone, “Mice!!” and then looking up and seeing the too expressive smile on Archibald's lips, and meeting his laughing eye, she laughed herself, a little hysterically, and looking again, and comprehending at a glance the change that had passed on Lisle, from a country-bred youth, fresh from college, to the perfection of ripe manhood, and seeing in place of the smooth face and the delicately tinted skin, a countenance consolidated by experience, illuminated by the habit of keen observation, and yet preserving an indefinable sweetness and sensibility that her memory had retained as the charm of its immaturity— “Mercy!” she thought, “what must he think of me? How could I rush so into his arms?” “Mr. Lisle,” she began, with a very sober consciousness— “Archy, if you please,” he said, interrupting her; “let me be still Archy, as you must remain `little Alice' to me, while you continue in peril of life, limb, and reason from a mouse, just as you were when you ran shrieking out of your mother's pantry.” “A mouse! Why there were droves of the horrid creatures; but it was not altogether my terror that made me so —so—so—” “Affectionate in your welcome? Now don't take that back, dear Alice.” “No, indeed!” she said, giving him her hand; “I am very, very glad to see you, so glad that I forgot it was seven years since we parted, and that I am no longer a little girl, and you no longer the very young man who was almost as familiar and dear in our home, as the brother we loved and mourned together. You know you almost took that brother's place, and it was on the strength of that feeling that we appealed to you in our present strait—and how kind of you to come so soon.” “Ah, dear Alice, your reasons are excellent, your instincts were better. Now let me know all that has happened to Max. I have only partly learned it from the officer here. I need no assurance of his innocence.” VOL. II. 7 While her brother, who had just been awakened by the turnkey's thundering rap at his door, was hurrying on his clothes, Alice briefly detailed the particulars. She was disturbed at Archibald vehemently biting his nails while he listened, an old inevitable trick of his, as she remembered, when any thing seriously disturbed him. “Do you think it very bad?” she concluded. “We will try to make it better,” he replied, turning from her to enter Max's cell, and to receive his affectionate welcome, demonstrated without any of the lets and hindrances that nature and society put between the sexes. After the glow of meeting had passed, cares overshadowed Archibald's brow, and he proposed at once to begin his work by offering bail for his friend. “I knew you would do that,” said Max, gratefully, “but for conscience' sake first send me a breakfast. I never can work or think till I have had my breakfast. Alice contrived to procure me a capital supper last evening.” “Alice! she can do any thing,” rejoined Archibald; “but confront—mice!” mimicking the low deprecating tone in which she had uttered that word. “Oh, that's nothing!” exclaimed Max, rather jealous of his sister's reputation. “All women, young and old, are just such geese about mice. I should like you, Archy, to show me another girl who would have come straightway and alone to a city where she never was before—on such an errand— and hitting all her nails on the head too. I say, Alice, you may be a coward about mice, if you will.” “I am afraid I can't help it, dear Max; I am a coward upon instinct.” “And every thing that's good and noble upon instinct, dear sister, so let that go for what it will fetch.” Archibald looked at the brother and sister with a smile, provoked, Alice thought, by the vain-glorying of her brother; she did not understand it. Archibald felt the impropriety of Alice prolonging her stay in her present quarters, and briefly explaining his relations with the Steinbergs he proposed taking her there. “Your breakfast, Max,” he said, “must wait till your sister is comfortably bestowed.” “What a brute was I not to think of that,” exclaimed Max; “but that's just me, I never think. I could fast a week for you, dear Alice, when once it was put into my head. Go with Archibald, and as soon as I am bailed out I will come to you.” So they parted. The unintermitting necessity of hard work, and the intervention of illness and absence had prevented, for some years, Lisle's often anticipated visits to Mapleton. When last he saw Alice there, she was a mere child—Arthur's pet and plaything, and his. “Eye-bright,” they called her from the resemblance of the color of her eye to the little star-flower sprinkled, like dew-drops over all the green-sward of our northern country. The result of his first scrutiny on meeting her was not flattering, “The sparkle of her childhood is gone,” thought he. “I expected to see her taller. The eye retains its lovely color, but it lacks lustre, and there is about her hair and dress altogether an unbecoming negligence. Her mother's disdain of personal decoration, tells sadly on her.” Lisle forgot to make allowance for the muss and soil of railroad travel, for the weariness, warring, watching, and weeping of thirty-six hours. He compared her, perhaps unconsciously, with his fixed standard of beauty. Certainly, Alice had not the height, the unconscious and consummate grace, or the brilliancy of coloring that characterized her friend, nor those irradiations of countenance that convey thought and feeling with the electrical swiftness of the telegraph. Lisle was but a man, and he was, even yet, with all his struggles and convictions, a lover, and, therefore, must be pardoned his susceptibility to the external. His reflections did justice to the intensity of Alice's devotion to her brother, and to her clear-headedness. A man admires that quality in a woman the more that it surprises him. His zeal and his fears were quickened by her presence. Alice felt strong in the innocence of her brother; Lisle knew it must be proven to those who had no such faith. After installing Alice in the comfortable quarters to which the Steinbergs had removed, he decided to inform Miss Herbert of her arrival in town. Lisle was now deeper in the world than when he wore his frock-coat to Mrs. Jones's dinner, and previous to presenting himself before Miss Herbert, he repaired to his own lodgings to perform his morning toilet. In this process he cast aside the traveling coat in which lay perdu the letter he had received at his country home from the village doctor. This letter containing some interesting matter, was destined to remain unread till another crisis of his life. Walter Herbert was coming down stairs, when he heard Lisle's voice inquiring for his niece. He hobbled down at his utmost speed, grasped Archibald's hand with both his, and with a face so joyous that it recalled to Lisle its utterly bereft expression when he last saw him. “Come up stairs,” he said, “to my room. What on earth were you away for at this particular time? Oh, I know. God forbid that I should forget that poor little girl's fate; and the sorrow to you. I was dreadfully shocked. But, my dear fellow, I am too happy now to remember griefs—the world's a flash of sunshine!” “What can this mean?” thought Lisle. Of course it could only mean the rupture of Grace's engagement. “Saved from drowning” would have been nothing, in comparison, to Walter Herbert. But he was prevented by that ubiquitous woman, his sister-in-law, to whom her servant had conveyed Lisle's inquiry. She opened the door of the breakfast-room, and called out in her officious tone, “Oh, good morning, Mr. Lisle, you wish to see Miss Grace?” (“The devil take her,” muttered Uncle Walter between his teeth. Excuse him, he was an old-fashioned man.) “She is with Mrs. Tallis,” continued the lady. “She has lost her only child—quite a severe affliction; and her husband was absent at the time—an aggravation, you know; and she has no near friends, and Grace and she were schoolmates; she has gone to stay with her till the funeral is over.” “There is dreadful misery there,” murmured Walter Herbert, while Lisle, with forced politeness, listened to the garrulous woman, and was turning to go, when Mr. Herbert said, “You are in a prodigious hurry. Will you come back before dinner?” “Before dinner, if I can.” “It must be before dinner, Lisle, for I must see you, and I am going up the river immediately after dinner.” “Then sir, it shall be before dinner, if possible.” But Lisle did not find it possible, and Uncle Walter was compelled to go off with the secret of Grace's temporal salvation unimparted, and Lisle was left to blunder on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “Tarry a little, there is something else.” After getting his bail accepted for Max Clifford, Archibald sent him to his sister, while he went to the house of Gilmore's father, in the hope of eliciting something that might be available to Max's defence. Mr. Gilmore's residence was in a fashionable street, and in one of those magnificent structures that the enterprise and intelligence of our citizens, and California gold, has added to the substantial wealth of our city. Certainly, neither intelligence nor any other analogous creative power builded the house of David Gilmore. An Irish lad, in livery, opened the door for Lisle. He was struck with a blending of acuteness and stupidity in the lad's face, not uncommon with his race. Lisle found Gilmore cautious and crusty; he declined listening to any particulars; said “that it was very onjust his family should be mixed up with a disgraceful business of that sort, merely because his son had the misforten to be in the same counting-house with the young fellow who had committed the forgery. This country fellow had, he understood, been a wild lad from the beginning. He had led his son astray for a while, but he—the father—being of opinion that boys' pranks was catchin, had removed his son from Beekwell's, and since Ernest had quit there, their acquaintance had ended, and his son had been remarkable correct.” After stating some facts in relation to the early and late intercourse of the lads at rather striking variance with the father's assertions, Lisle frankly told him Clifford's version of the presentation of the draft; and added, “that legal steps had been taken to confront the young men, and that he should prove at the trial of his client, that Ernest was not at home, as had been asserted, through the morning of the fraud, but that he had been distinctly recognized in Wall-street by more than one person.” The unhappy father had no quieting consciousness of his son's uprightness, and he was evidently flustered. The affair did not seem so easily disposed of as before a powerful friend had appeared for Clifford. Upon Lisle asking, “if Mr. Ernest was at home, to be allowed to speak with him,” Gilmore rang the bell, and the Irish lad who had admitted Lisle, came from the pantry, the door of which was ajar. “What are you doing there, you rascal?” exclaimed his master. “Listening?” “`Listening!' No indeed, your honor. I was just stopping quiet, not to be after disturbing the gentleman.” True to his Celtic blood, Pat's invention was ready at need. At Mr. Gilmore's bidding, he went in search of his son, and returned, saying, “Mr. Ernest is not at home,” accompanying the assertion with a side glance at Lisle, which, to his quick perception, eliminated the not. “It does not much signify,” he said to Mr. Gilmore. “The examination of my client is deferred till to-morrow morning. The young men must then be confronted; and allow me to beg, that nothing may prevent your son being present, and punctual. He would be compromised by his absence; strong suspicions are afloat against him.” “The evidence against your friend,” retorted Gilmore, “is too heavy to be toppled over by suspicions. My son will be present.” As Lisle left the house, Patrick, bare-headed, followed him into the street, looking back and around to elude observation. “Did I hear aright?” he asked, “and is it young Mr. Clifford, God help him, that's in trouble?” “Yes.” “Stop a bit—your honor's a gintleman; don't be after going like a railroad. Tell me the name, plase, was on the nasty bit o' paper.” “Thomas Innis.” “And how do you be after spillin' it?” “Spelling, do you mean?” “The same, plase your honor.” “Thom—” “Not Sint Thomas; faith and I was tached that at home.” “Ah, Innis—I-n-n-i-s.” “That's the very one! Thanks to Him above,” cried Patrick, grinning wide his cavernous mouth, as if to let out a volume of joy. “Pat!” screamed a voice from the area of Gilmore's house, “you're wanted.” “Don't scrame so unpolite, Bridget. You'll hare from me,” he added to Lisle, and as he retraced his steps, he muttered, “that shall he if I lose my place. It was the poor lad himself saved my ould mother, and should not I give him a lift—why not?” The Irishman's promise made no impression on Lisle. He well knew the hot hearts and hasty sympathies of the Irish race, and merely inferred that listening to Max Clifford's sad case, had turned the current of Pat's toward him. After a hard day's work in their service, Lisle was obliged to go to his young friends at Steinberg's, with but gloomy prospects for the next day. He had nothing to offer at Clifford's examination, but the testimony of the heads of both the mercantile houses in which he had been employed, to his truth and uprightness. This was not enough to rebut the direct evidence against him. He found Grace Herbert with Alice. The young women had bridged over the abyss of their long separation with many a pleasant memory, and Grace was casting that spell of enchantment over Alice which can hardly be defined, and certainly not resisted. Alice's anxieties had been suspended for an hour, and even Max seemed like one suddenly awakened from a delicious trance, when the entrance of Archibald turned all their thoughts on the approaching examination in the Municipal Court. Archibald proceeded to communicate the meagre result of the day's investigation, and as he concluded, he asked Max if there were any foundation for the Irish lad's interest in him? Max modestly told the probable ground of it. He said, “that in one of his fast drives, with Ernest Gilmore, down the Third Avenue with a famous trotter, and a heavy bet at stake, Ernest drove against a woman, who proved to be this same Patrick's mother. Her arm was broken, and she was otherwise badly bruised. Ernest drove the horse to the stable; he (Max) helped to convey the old woman to her shanty, and afterwards gave her, from time to time, what succor he could. Ernest was, as usual, out of pocket, but he proposed to make what reparation he could, and save himself from a prosecution by the injured party, by inducing his mother to take the lad, Patrick, who had just arrived a raw boy, into her service. `I'll come round the old lady,' that was his respectful mode of alluding to his mother; `she likes nothing better than training a fresh hand, if she can get him under price. Pat is a likely lad—she's a trump at training, and when he gets on his livery he'll do.'” It may be matter of some surprise that any mistress of a Fifth Avenue palace should thus bestow her time and talents, 7* but Mrs. Gilmore had achieved her greatness by beginning as the “smart” and pretty daughter of a country innkeeper. She had married a New York shopkeeper, and by “slow, but not easy stages,” had arrived at her present position, with a carriage and liveried servants, and one only son; that son such as might be expected from the ambition, the examples, and the society of his parents; the paramount interest of the one, being the rise and fall of stocks—and of the other, ostentation at the least possible outlay. Both Grace and Alice found ground for some vague expectation in the intimations of the Irish lad; to the young men they seemed without foundation. Women are not always wrong in kindling their hopes by their desires. To Alice's quick and apprehensive observation, it was ominous of evil that Lisle seemed hardly to be conscious of Miss Herbert's presence, and that when, at the sound of her carriage, she rose to go, he did not raise his eye from some papers he was examining. But when she said, “Mr. Lisle, will it do, or will it not, for this poor little sister to go with her brother to the court-room to-morrow?” his eye lighted as he turned it on her; he was about to reply—he hesitated. “Oh, pray say yes, Archy,” said Alice; “poor Max will have no friend to stand by him; you, you know, will only appear as his counsel.” “But, dear little Alice,” said Lisle, speaking to her as if she were still the petted child of their earlier days, “that miserable court-room is no place for you, alone; if your mother—” “Alone!” interrupted Grace; “do you imagine I was so barbarous as to propose that? No, we have arranged it all—settled it together. I go with her as sister, mother, friend—one or all, as you please; and—stop, hear us through —not merely satisfied to be `strong-armed with conscience,' like the lady in Comus, but we will go in strict deference to the judgment that may be supposed to emanate from the best society in such an anomalous case. My dear brother-in-law, Frank Esterly, late clergyman, will go with us; he is rueful enough just now to give us solemn countenance. Now tell us honestly, if you were balancing the evidence for and against this poor fellow, might not the presence of three friends be the feather to turn the scale—the last ounce on the back of the camel, to crush his opponent?” “To me, Miss Herbert, it might be a blinding evidence, but our judges must be governed by precedent and statute; however, if you ladies have the courage, I make no opposition. We must give Max every possible chance.” “Then to-morrow at nine, Alice, I will be with you,” said Grace; “and for once I will borrow my step-mother's coach —we must invest ourselves in the respectabilities.” The sun went with Grace, and night and dews came. When Lisle returned from putting her in the carriage, he found Max gloomily leaning his elbow on the mantel, and Alice standing drooping beside him. She hastily wiped away her tears. “Is the trial to-morrow final, Archy?” she asked. “Yes—the grand jury was in session when Max was arrested, and immediately found an indictment against him.” “It looks black as night,” said Max. “What were those papers you were looking at, Archy?” “The draft you presented, which the officers at the bank very kindly permitted me to take possession of to compare the endorsement with your handwriting and Gilmore's. I hoped the experts, to whom I submitted it, would detect a resemblance to Gilmore's.” “And they did not?” “Not satisfactorily. They rather inclined to the opinion, that there was more resemblance to the characteristics of his hand than to yours; but their opinion was not strong enough to give value to their testimony.” “Experts, indeed!” exclaimed poor Max, in a tone as sad as it was contemptuous. “Do you, Alice, sit down, and examine the papers; you are an `expert' in every thing.” Alice sat down, and Archibald beside her, but even her keen perception availed nothing. “Oh, Max,” she said, “I could myself swear to this for your handwriting.” “Then the game is up. I see there is no hope for me.” “Oh, don't say so, dear Max, till after to-morrow; nor then, even if they convict you—the very worst—yet we may get a pardon.” “A pardon! I'll not take a pardon from them; what has an innocent man to do with a pardon?” Max, like most people of his temperament, sank as easily as he rose. He was now at the bottom of the abyss. Alice's fertility in resources was not exhausted. “I have heard,” she said, “of a fraud detected by the manufacturer's date on the paper.” She held the Innis draft to the candle. “There is neither date nor letter on this,” she added, sadly shaking her head. Max bent his head to examine it. “But—by George! look Alice—Archy look! Don't you see fine water-lines, a check all through the paper?” They did see it, and both looked to Max for an explanation. He said it was paper bought of an old Frenchman, Merceau, who lived in a garret in Nassau-street. “Gilmore bought all his paper of him. He was very fond of making errands there to see a pretty grand-daughter of old Merceau; he used to take presents to her, and I told him it was not fair, and we had a little fight about it. It's the same paper—I've twenty notes from the rascal written on it. That was a bright thought of yours, Alice! was n't it, Archy?” Lisle cordially assented, and soon left the brother and sister to follow up, himself, the faint light that had dawned. Clifford was present when the court opened the next morning. Lisle was on one side of him; his sister, Mr. Esterly, and Grace, on the other. Ernest Gilmore soon after entered with his counsel, one of the ablest lawyers in the city. Ernest's friends were of the “fast” order, and having rather nervous associations with the purlieus of Courts of Justice, they did not find it convenient to be with him. His father stood upon his dignity, and would not give countenance to the complication of his son by appearing at the investigation. There was, however, no lack of an audience: the morning papers had given sufficient publicity to the affair, to fill the court-room with curious idlers. It was soon obvious which way the current of sympathy set. Human nature, unbiassed by selfishness or prejudice, is true to its instincts. Legal proof might fail Max at his need, but there was persuasive testimony in his favor in his fair candid brow, his clear open eye with its straight-forward look-out, in the purity and sweet affectionateness of his countenance—an insurance against meanness of all sorts— and in his healthy aspect, and manly bearing. Ernest was tall, and thin, and with very handsome features. He was faultlessly got up by tailors, and barbers, and other professors of like “branches of learning;” but he had a certain pallor and tremulousness, that indicated his way of life, and the vulgarity of expression that inevitably follows it. We have not the masculine pen of Dickens—nor, alas! the fathomless genius whereby he sounds the miry depths of humanity, or the opportunities and the observation that aid him in reproducing the infinite variety of life, with all its vitality, on his pages. Therefore we can only give the briefest summary of this morning's proceedings, so critical to our dear friends. We shall not attempt to describe the confident hope that actually shone in poor Max's face, as witness after witness from the houses of Beekwell &amp; Co., and Smith &amp; Eaton, deposed to the integrity of his character; nor Alice's sweet trustful smile, showing even through the folds of her veil, as her eye met her brother's, nor the gratulation of Grace Herbert's brilliant face, nor the quiet assured faith of Esterly's pale, fine countenance, nor how their hopes rose to the highest mark, as Lisle, with all the ingenuity of his profession, and the earnestness of his zeal, converted probabilities—so it seemed to them—to proofs. But alas! for the old saying, “one story is good till another is told.” When the young ladies, in the bliss of their ignorance of the “glorious uncertainties of the law,” trusted it all settled in Max's favor, and he—a greenhorn, as he afterward called himself—thought so too, the district attorney rose, and weakened the testimony to Max's character, by producing witnesses to testify that he had been dismissed from Beekwell &amp; Co.'s in consequence of frequent absences on “sprees,” and that he had been repeatedly seen with “fast” young men driving “fast” horses along the avenues. These irregularities the counsel argued, led to expenses not to be met by the ordinary receipts of a clerk. He granted every thing that could be claimed from the general impression of the probity of the young man, and assented to all that it was reasonable to infer from the influences of his rural home. “It was evident,” he said, turning his eye to Alice, and pausing while it rested on her now pale and tearful face, “that they were of the most salutary and interesting nature, and he could but exclaim, as he looked upon the youth, with still the freshness and purity of his country life, on his unblighted countenance, `Would to God it were possible to exculpate him!' But alas! how rapid is the work of depravation in the corrupting atmosphere of this city; before the bloom fades, the fruit is infected to the core! How small temptations mark the sliding scale! How short and rapid is the passage through the seemingly innocent indulgence that the gay and audacious temperament of youth craves, how short it is to crime! A proof of this dreadful acceleration from `deep to lower deep' was striking in the unscrupulousness of Clifford in accusing a generous friend, a far graver offence than the hasty transgression, which might have been committed in a moment of despair,” etc., etc. He recurred to the evidence in relation to the paper bought of Merceau. “Doubtless the old man had, as he swore, sold that paper to Ernest Gilmore, and he, Merceau, alone had imported it from the manufactory in France. But Gilmore had, as Merceau admitted, been in the habit for two years of buying that paper, and what was more probable than that he had shared it with his friend to whom, as has been shown, he had, perhaps too lavishly imparted of his superior means, etc., etc. As to the argument drawn from the hue of the paper corresponding precisely with that of the last importation—a half ream of this, Merceau had testified to having sold to Gilmore within a few days—it was most futile. A sheet within a package, shut from the air in a writing-case, would not be perceptibly changed in months. And finally,” he said, “he felt too much compassion for the young man, too much sorrow”—“for his family,” he would have added, but seeing that Alice, unable to sustain herself, had dropped her head on her brother's shoulder, he paused, and eager to avert observation from her, he hastily concluded, saying that “it was unnecessary for him to dwell on the comparison unfavorable to his client, which had been instituted between the young men; they were associates and intimates, and it would require an acute analysis to detect their different degree of merit; and finally, the jury,” he said, “must decide against the defendant, there being nothing in the slight probabilities alleged in his favor to invalidate the fatal evidence against him in the plain handwriting of the endorsement of the draft.” He sat down, and Esterly whispered to Grace that their verdict would doubtless be against Clifford, and that she had best withdraw her friend; but Alice, when the proposal was made, shook her head, “Oh, let me,” she said, “stay with him till the last minute.” “Don't be disheartened,” whispered Lisle, “we may—we must get a pardon.” But poor Max was utterly disheartened. He felt the full force of the truth “that the difference of going just right and a little wrong in the commencement of the journey of life, is the difference between a happy home or a miserable slough at the end of it.” The ploughshare had uprooted his self-confidence, and humility was springing up. To him it did not now seem a slight departure from right, “a little wrong,” that by dangerous associates and selfish indulgences he had periled his own honor, and his mother's and sister's happiness. “Any punishment,” he thought, “is not too severe for me, if I could bear it alone.” But the thought of the dark shadow he had cast on his dear home unmanned him, and the handkerchief with which he hid his convulsed face, was drenched in tears. At this moment a letter was passed over to Lisle. It was written on the coarsest paper, and folded not after the likeness of any thing in heaven or earth. Within it was an old envelop resealed. He at first looked at the hand-writing despairingly. The words were oddly formed, syllables as oddly parted, and capitals thrown in or left out, hap-hazard. He was about to thrust it into his pocket for a leisure moment, when certain names caught his eye, and he explored his way through the following lines with intense eagerness: “dearsiranonord:—it was My mothers prares to the blessed Virgin that was thecosofit—that is my stain in the pantry, and unbenonst harin you tell of poor young Mr. clifford, that same young gintleman savin My ould mother after she Comin all the wa from Ireland, she and The pig notthepig For that wascrished and squealin when Mr. clifford —the Almighty blesshimfor that Same Took the little ould woman like a Fither in hes Arms in the Shanty and haledup the wunes of Body and hart fetchin the doctor and byin a Frish one that Is a pig for The dareould lady. so You see, sir, for Yees may want the testimoni I larned to rite a bit At home and wasafter larnin better here cos theboyssas a poor man may be a Poor prisident in yees country. so goin won nite to mr. ernest's room with the cole I sese scitterd On the floor a letter sinde Thomas Innis, splindid riten and a sheetof paper All over rit Thomas Innis so sasiPat sasi this Is iligant for you to copy, and no loss to the Yung gintelman fortis But paper and Ink so I pitsitin my pock et handylike.

The smile that lifted all the clouds from Archibald's face as he involuntarily looked toward the group of which Max was the centre, indicated good news. Lisle asked to be heard, and, after some controversy, having obtained permission of the court to offer some newly discovered evidence, he, with such explanations as were necessary, exhibited the documents enclosed by Pat. A murmur of satisfaction ran through the court-room. Not a person there was silent, excepting those who were too suddenly happy for words, and the poor, already convicted wretch, on whose shoulder an officer had laid his hand. From the door-way came a voice silencing all others, crying out, “It's I, Pat M`Cormick, that writ the letter, and that same am here quite entirely ready to swear all that your Honors command.” Pat was admitted. If it is difficult for an Irishman to tell the truth, he can emit it, and Pat answered satisfactorily to examination, and cross-examination. Max Clifford was discharged, and Gilmore committed. Max had paid dearly for his follies; Gilmore was to pay, perhaps, his antecedents taken into consideration, too dearly for his crime. But perfect justice is not attainable at human tribunals, and there were other parties to the offences of these lads, not in anywise amenable there; not, perhaps, accused by their own consciences, but who will assuredly be found wanting, and receive a greater condemnation when summoned to the bar of the infallible judge. There are thousands of young men in our city employed by merchants, and rich mechanics who acknowledge none but a business relation with them, who never, for a moment, consider the duty of looking after their morals, and their rightful recreations, which have so much to do with their morals. Had Beekwell &amp; Co., or Messrs. Smith &amp; Eaton extended a kind hand to Max Clifford; had they, in any mode, linked him into their social life, they would have saved him from imminent peril, and his family from a cruel heart-ache. Hundreds of young men are lost by similar neglect. That loss is fearful, but it may be found, hereafter, that the loss of the golden opportunity of doing good which Providence bestows upon the prosperous, is more fearful! “Oh bright occasions of dispensing good, How seldom used, how little understood!”* * While these pages are going to press, we have heard a fact which we are proud to record. A hatter in Brooklyn has, during the past winter, employed an eminent chemist to lecture to his nine hundred workmen, twice a week, at fifty dollars a lecture. Rarely has one of the nine hundred seats of this little army been vacant. Better this, than the charge of the six hundred at Balaklava.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. “Sweet are the uses of adversity.” Occupation, that mighty helper, and consolation of life, and the best occupation, thought, feeling, and doing for others, had been Grace's friend in need. The few last days had been divided between her ministry to Augusta Tallis, and her solacing companionship with Alice. In a letter to her sister, in which she had given a brief history of Clifford's affair, she says:— “I find dear little Alice charming. She has all the freshness of her childhood, with a marvelous ripe judgment. “The opportunity,” she continues, “of serving my friends at this time, has been a providential boon to me. It has saved me from the weary task of pondering over the past. It has been well for Frank, too, to have his last leaden hours lightened and brightened by working for others; not the most cheerful work either, in poor Augusta's case; but work that will help to cement the foundation on which the super-structure of her future life is to rest. “The funeral service for poor little Elise was most touching. There was no one present but the parents, Frank, and myself; no one to let in the world, and interrupt solemn thought, and impair holy feeling. “Augusta was so exhausted by the scenes of the last fortnight, that, though she has rallied since her husband's return, she seemed, on the morning of the funeral, hovering between life and death; so pallid, tremulous, and faintish, that I despaired of her getting through with it, but after Frank came, she was stronger, and quite calm. I never was so impressed with the official power of a clergyman to `speak as one having authority.' “The little coffin was closed. I had laid a wreath of white rose-buds, and jasmins upon it; Augusta did not notice it. Her eyes “`Were homes of silent prayer;' and whether raised or cast down, were looking far beyond the material things that surrounded her, except once or twice when, with a consciousness of her husband's arm being around her, she turned them on him with melancholy tenderness, as if in grateful recognition of his support. “Your husband, dear Eleanor, is worth all the efforts you are making for him. I never admired him more than yesterday. He did his office so unconventionally, so from his heart. He spoke, probing truth, as God's commissioned messenger should, as his divine Master did; it was sharp as steel; but steel used for excision, and not to wound. I am sure he has done good to both husband and wife. Strange to say it; but I believe their child's death will prove the greatest blessing of their life. She has fallen into the abyss that separated them, and it is fast closing up. “How strange of you, dear Nel, who have always done the right thing at the right time, to fall ill just at this moment: `it should have been hereafter.' I did the best I could to supply your place, and went to the ship with Frank. Archibald Lisle was with us, and had provided Frank with all sorts of cheer and comfort; not the least among them, charming books and late reviews. This young man is a study to me. How in the world, in the midst of his busy professional life, can he do so many kind deeds that cost time and thought? It is true, as Uncle Walter says, that the busiest people do all the odd jobs of humanity. Why, Archibald Lisle gave into Frank's hand six sheets of instructions closely written, mapping out his tour for him, telling him what to see, and—sagacious young man—what not to see. Recommending some great economies, and warning him against small ones as harassing, and interfering with the great objects of his voyage. As I look back, dear Eleanor, I think I have been unconsciously influenced by the revelations of what seemed to me our family doom in the old green trunk. You remember the morning we spent over it. It filled me with an undefinable dread of that irremediable step on which a woman's happiness is staked. You know I have had plenty of lovers, some too good for me, perhaps; but I bridled my affections, and they passed on. And while I thought I was warily watching my one persevering lover, he mastered my weaknesses. Well, since I have finished the game of a young woman's life, won, not lost it, I have turned to `looking on.' I see in my dear little friend, Alice, the predestined fate of Lisle; at present, she rushes into his arms, with nothing beyond the sweet confidence of an inherited and childish love. But she is now past eighteen, and something more is dawning. I see it in the quick mutation of her cheek, and in her sensitiveness to every look and word of his; and it is inevitable he should fall in love with her. If I do not much mistake, he has already. His manners with her are gay, cordial, almost caressing, but with nothing of that free underbred familiarity so disgusting in our `free and easy' young men. My cheek burns as I recur to my monstrous vanity in telling you that I saw certain signs in Lisle that I might easily convert him into a lover. I think my judgment was bewitched. With me he was reserved and stately, with some occasional melting like a thaw in January. Now he is `more so.' If ever in the intimate intercourse of the past week he was surprised into a relenting, he suddenly reverted to a sort of chronic disapprobation. I suspect he has observed my degrading entanglement, and been disgusted—no wonder. But courage! When he is Alice's husband, I will try to win his friendship in the most comprehensive sense of that noble relation. “Dear Nelly, you'll not care for these speculations when you are longing to hear of your husband; but you will forgive them, knowing I have always been addicted to what Shakspeare courteously calls `maiden meditation.' I am coming to you on Saturday, with Frank's last words and kisses for you and the children. He went off cheered by a promise I made (and will explain to you), that I will put my shoulder to your obstructed wheel. “When I returned from the ship to my own room at home, where I have not been since I first went to poor Augusta, I found on my table the trinkets which I left on that memorable evening scattered over the drawing-room carpet. They were inclosed in a box, sealed and directed with Mrs. Herbert's pedantic nicety, and on the box was lying a note from that lady, which being characteristic, I copy for your edification:—`My Dearest Grace, you are quite safe with Anne and me; neither facts nor surmises shall transpire. I shall, on this trying occasion, as I have ever endeavored, act the part of a mother by you. H. C. has been here more than once, and, I am happy to say, exhibits no unpleasant feeling. He has made no allusion to that evening. It was awkward, and he is ever taciturn, and we must allow for little peculiarities. Mrs. Tallis' sending those trinkets to you at such an unsuitable time is just a specimen of human nature. Death when it comes near arouses the conscience, and excited feeling will exaggerate. But married ladies should not trifle, and I hope and trust that Mrs. Tallis will lay to heart the good lesson she has had. Afflictions do not spring out of the ground. H. C. has made no inquiries about you, and I advised Anne not to allude to your being at Mrs. Tallis', as I thought you acted a little too impulsively in going there, and, as I observed to Anne, lovers should be left to settle their own quarrels. Of course such a sensible woman as you are will forgive and forget, and only smile at Mrs. T.'s pique. Your ever anxious and affectionate friend and mother, “`S. H.' “`Oh, what fools these mortals be!' Eleanor.” “Here is John to tell me `the ladies have come in from their drive, and Mrs. Herbert would like to speak to Miss Grace in her room.' John smiled knowingly as he gave me the message, and as I came before the front window on the landing, `Has Miss Grace,' he asked, `seen Mr. Copley's splendid new carriage?' It was just turning from the door, the same equipage which he wrote to me he had `ordered for us.' `It seems as if Miss Anne felt dreadful proud-like in Miss Grace's place,' said John, whether in sympathy for me, or contempt for us all, I could not quite tell, but the latter emotion these people, whom we call our `inferiors,' must often feel for us. “Our step-mother looked at me with her beady eyes, as if she expected to fathom my heart—her line is too short for that. `You observed perhaps, dear Grace,' she said, `that we came home in Horace Copley's carriage?' “`John called my attention to it,' I replied. “`Oh, I feared you might think it strange. But I have judged it important to keep up appearances, in any event.' She paused, I made no reply, and she proceeded: `I have been really anxious about you, my dear, on many accounts. I have kept very secret your being at Mrs. Tallis', for you know the world will talk, and it would tend to widen this truly unhappy rupture, if Horace Copley should hear any remarks made about the rather striking suddenness of your friendship for Mrs. Tallis.' Again she paused, and again proceeded: `It is but paying a due respect to society to guard against its mistakes, and its possible censure.' And so, dear Eleanor, she went on, and on, with a deal of `namby pamby stuff,' and finding it did not bring me to the point, she said, in a slightly apologetic tone, `I have thought it judicious to keep up our relations with Horace Copley to prevent gossip —the world never gets matters quite straight; and whether the engagement is renewed or not, my object is to save your reputation, Grace, from all possible damage.' “`The engagement will never be renewed,' I said; `so pray, ma'am, go on, and keep up your relations with Mr. Copley, and extend them at pleasure. My reputation you may leave in my own charge. The world happily knows nothing of my engagement to Mr. Copley, and that I believe is the only circumstance in my relation with him that could damage it.' “Mrs. Herbert was not in the least nettled. She saw she had made a point in her game; the satisfaction of her soul shone through her face, in spite of her evident effort to look serious and sympathetic. “A box of Paris finery had just been unpacked, and its contents were strewn over the bed and chairs. Mrs. Herbert coolly pointed out the new fashion of the hats, the new cut of the mantillas, and the `lovely trimmings, so French,' of the dresses. Yesterday, at Augusta Tallis' request, I had packed away, and sent away, similar properties of hers. The vision of this lovely mourner, eager to “`Buy terms divine, in selling hours of dross— Within, be fed; without, be rich no more,' filled my mind's eye, and I rather recoiled from this `Vanity VOL. II. 8 Fair.' Mrs. Herbert gave her own interpretation to my indifference. `My dear,' she said, `forgive me; it really did not occur to me, that “if the course of true love had run smooth,” you would now be getting beautiful things for yourself; but when you have lived as long as I have, you will learn, my dear, that there is nothing so likely to happen as change.' “I bit my lips to keep them from answering this profound dip into life, according to my wont, with insolence or contempt. The `old Adam' was fast getting too strong for the `young Melancthon,' and I discreetly returned to my own apartment. “Now, my dear sister, is it worth my while to try and live longer with this woman? Her world is not our world. You might be equal to it, and in time you might win her over to serve God more, and mammon less; but I am not. I must, to borrow a feather from this owl of wisdom, `arrange my life judiciously, to preserve a due balance,' which, I must confess, that with my habit of shifting all my feelings from one scale to the other, I never yet have done. “There has been a long series of petty aggressions and provocations on the part of my step-mother and her daughter, and of equally petty irritations and contempts on mine. I thought myself strong enough to overcome them; I am not. Change of air is the only cure for habits, as for chronic diseases. So, my dear Eleanor, I will come to you, and you and the children will bring out all that is good in me. By and by, when Uncle Walter comes home from his summer trip, we will arrange for him, too; and we will all, together, stand by May's philosophy about the `little wooden house at Harlem.'” Grace proceeded to make arrangements for her new life; and first of all, she inscribed on the parcel containing Mrs. Tallis' jewels—blessed talismans to Grace—“Vouchers of a broken compact,” and inclosing, and directing it to “Horace Copley, Esq.,” she gave it into the hands of a trusty messenger. The next day, after having assured Mrs. Herbert that the world would take no exceptions to her removing her residence to Mrs. Esterly's house in the absence of her husband, she took a decorous leave of her step-mother and Miss Carlton, and they parted forever, with mutual satisfaction, as inmates of a common home. Grace was shocked to find Eleanor in bed with a fever, and much more ill than she had supposed. She was suffering the consequence of too prolonged a strain upon her nervous system, for Eleanor had nerves, though they were sheathed in heavenly patience. She had “waited on the Lord and been of good courage,” when her boy sickened and died. She had borne with unvarying cheerfulness the petulance engendered by the most wearying of all diseases; she had sustained alone the burden of domestic cares; and finally, when she had let her house to enable her husband to repair his health by a year's travel in Europe, and had packed her family into the little Harlem box, and began her career of instruction, she broke down. Courage and energy had done their work; submission and patience were now to do theirs. She was like our precious perpetuals; when one blossoming of roses is perfected, another buds and goes on to maturity. The effluence of the virtues is truly the “odor of sanctity.” “I have come just in time,” said Grace, kissing her sister's hot cheek; “shall I take possession of your spare room?” “My spare-room! What a change from your spacious apartments. How you will miss not only elegances, Grace, but comforts.” “Eleanor, are you turning world's-woman? Do you remember `how much better is a dinner of herbs,' etc.—must I quote Scripture to you? I am not yet one of those who `can spare the necessaries of life, but not the luxuries.' You and your children are to me `the necessaries;' your illness seems to me most opportune!” “Opportune! Could any thing be more ill-timed?” “To me, Eleanor, it does not seem so. I wanted this seeming cloud, this providential shower, to nourish the good seed just dropped into my heart, that it may spring up and grow before the thorns—the natural product of the soil, Eleanor—choke it. Perhaps you do not know it is one thing to form good resolutions, and another to keep them. Hitherto there has been a division of labor between us; I have formed them and you have kept them.” “Oh, Grace!” exclaimed Eleanor, with protest in her voice. “Now,” proceeded Grace, “you must leave the doing to me. Dear, good Cousin Effie will take care of the children, and I will go daily to town and give your music-lessons. I shall not be half so good a teacher as you are, for I have neither your method nor your patience; but I am a more brilliant performer, and therefore shall please the mammas, and will try to practise your sweet patience, and so please your pupils, who will be sure to test that virtue.” “Come, Grace, come!” called out May Esterly, impatiently, “and look out of your own dear little window, and see the violets that are blowing out on my garden-bed, and ever so many birds without any cages, on the trees, and Harlem river is only a little way off, and if you look very sharp, you can see the cars passing. Oh, aren't you glad you are never going back to live in that old big house in Bond-street?” “I am, May, I am!” replied Grace, and with a glee almost equal to the child's, she ran away to partake the ever fresh pleasures of childhood. And thus Grace Herbert, the observed of observers who, by uniting fashion to beauty and accomplishments, was perhaps the most admired and the most envied young woman in all our “Vanity Fair,” renounced a marriage which would have added to her position the brilliancy of fortune, deliberately left a life of elegant ease and most lady-like indulgence, to live in a very humble suburban house, and earn a frugal living for her sister's family, by giving “lessons in music.” Whether she were elevated or degraded by this step, must be left to the judgment of her peers.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. “I come with joyful tidings; we shall part no more.” Mapleton is, or was—our to-days are very unlike our yesterdays—a secluded village in New England. It lies in a hill and lake country with intervening valleys and meadows that are enriched by the spring freshets with alluvial soil. A railroad now skirts the valley, but at the epoch of our story the simplicity of rural life was in no way invaded. There was no monster hotel; only a two-storied inn, with its traditions of “the Revolution,” “Shay's war,” and a flaming ghost that once haunted its precincts. The “dollar” was not yet “almighty” in Mapleton, but such things as contentment, mental accomplishment, social respect, and self-respect were there held superior to it and independent of it. No city-earned fortunes ruffled its quiet surface, and—oh, blissful days!—no city bees broke the silence of its summer shades. The village-street runs parallel to Lily Pond, a bit of water some six or seven miles in circumference. Lily Pond may it remain, in spite of the more dainty parlance of the present time, and in spite of its ambitious rechristening as Lake Bona Vista, by Colonel Donalphonso Hart, a return-volunteer from the Mexican war, who illustrated Mapleton by his nativity. The indigenous name of this lovely bit of water indicates the lotus that profusely adorns its bosom in the month of August, shooting up its long flexile stems, unfolding its white petals, with a pink tint as delicate as an infant's blush, and breathing out the rich odors it seems to have inhaled from the voluptuous sweets of summer. Mapleton is the oldest village in the county. The beauty of its position was accidental for, its founders being true sons of the Pilgrim Fathers, like them eschewed the quality of beauty as if it were a device of the wicked one. Throughout New England the Puritans turned their backs upon the sweet South and its cheerful sunshine, facing their houses to the cold blasts of the North, as they did their tempers to the rigors of life. So it came, that the shores of Lily Pond that looked to the east and south with their charming variety of rock, and woodland, and flowery turf, were abandoned to unseemly barns, and slovenly yards, into which kitchens and sheds opened, and that the houses were built hap-hazard on either side a wide street winding in parallel line with the winding shore; the west side being preferred for building, as highest, and driest, and as commanding wider fields of pasture, grain, and woodland, intervening between it and the mountain barrier of the township. Civilization had, however, begun its work in Mapleton. The native taste of some of its people was cultivated; a few had traveled, and they were beginning to adorn their rural homes with filial love and reverence, the reverence attaching itself to old things, the love creating new beauties. Creeping roses sheltered and adorned the bared trunks of old trees, Virginia creepers shot over old barns, and honey-suckles, and the native clematis, perfumed and graced old porches. Fences were removed, yards became “lawns,” shrubberies were set, patches of flowers bloomed out from the greensward, gravel-walks were laid out, piazzas erected, and the whole screened from the cold north and envious east wind by thick plantings of our native hemlock. All honor be to the women of Mapleton, who, by their “Married Ladies' Cemetery Association,” and their “Young Ladies' Flower Committee,” hastened on this rural millennium. Alice Clifford's home was at the southern extremity of the village, overlooking the lake and near its outlet, and so placed in relation to it, that when the slant beams of the sun touched the stream, it could be seen here and there, for many a mile, gliding through meadows, and stealing around high wooded hills. But (like all the masculine gender) it disappeared from Mapleton so soon as, fed by mountain-rills, it attained its full stature, and could no longer be recognized for the brook that, studded with anemones and violets, issued from Lily Pond. Mrs. Clifford's house was the largest and best in the village. It had been in her husband's family for three generations, and thereby had a remote antiquity and extraordinary traditional interest in a country where the second generation builds its houses in Ohio, the third in Minnesota or California, and the fourth—heaven knows where. It was at the close of an August day, just as the day was fading into twilight, and the delicious coolness of our northern summer evenings was revitalizing the air, that Archibald Lisle arrived at Mapleton, and approached Mrs. Clifford's. He stared around him, confused by the grouping of familiar and unfamiliar objects. A young man drove the coach, whom he recognized as having been a chore lad at his friend's; now he was the proprietor of a small livery establishment. “I guess you don't hardly mistrust where you are,” he said to Archy, as they entered a narrow avenue winding through a wood; “Mis' Clifford's girl has had the modeling of the old place,” he said, “and she is not a fool by a long shot; but making this—a-venue they call it—through the grove, when there was a broad road, straight as a die, so that you could drive right to the front door, in the darkest night, was a notion. To go dodging round these trees—she would not have one cut down—why it's—well (pausing). I should say it was double the distance it was by the old road, and so lonesome and confusing. But it's a slick sight here,” he added, his voice cheerily changing, as they emerged from the wood and saw Lily Pond reflecting the rose-tinted sky; and the heavy cloud just lifted like a black curtain from the horizon, permitting the last rays of the sun to shine out and kindle, as with a flame, the topmost branches of the trees and the summits of the opposite hills. Archibald looked in vain for the broad front door, that, ever wide open, seemed to speak a smiling welcome. “There's no getting in at the old spot,” said his conductor; “go round the corner of the house, and you'll find a kind of a fandango there.” Lisle eagerly went forward and found a picturesque porch, whose door was open with the old look of hospitality. He entered and passed through a passage, not into the “dwelling-room” that lived in his dear remembrance, but into a modernized apartment with a bay-window of plate glass, opening upon a terraced garden extending to the lake. More in keeping with this novel aspect than were the accustomed inmates, was the graceful figure that rose from the piano at his entrance. “I am very glad to see you, Mr. Lisle,” said Grace Herbert, extending her hand, “and sorry that I am the only one of your friends here to welcome you —but don't look so disappointed (did Archibald look disappointed?)—you were not expected for an hour. Mrs. Clifford has gone to the village on business, Max is out shooting, and Alice,” she was putting her hand on the bell to ring for a servant to call Alice, when a sound was heard, more like the rush of a startled bird, than a footstep, and Alice, gliding down stairs, entered, her face radiant with a welcome sweeter than words could make it. “Oh, how glad my mother will be to find you really here, Archy! and I am so glad; and were n't you,” Alice faltered, at a loss for the right 8* word, and then added, not quite as if she had found it, “surprised to find Miss Herbert here? I meant you should be, Archy.” “I certainly had no expectation of finding Miss Herbert here,” he replied, with a slight embarrassment, and averting his eye. “Ah, Mr. Archy,” thought Alice, “you are as glad as you are surprised, though you try hard not to appear so;” and then observing his abstracted look, she said, “I am afraid it does not seem like home to you.” “Oh, yes, Alice, your mother's home will always be and seem home to me; but I confess to a lingering love of the old look. I miss the many doors whose slamming and banging were pleasant to my boyish ears—the `entry door' and the `bed-room door,' and the `t'other-room door,' and, above all, the old cupboard that Arthur and I used to ransack and rifle; but here,” he added, turning to the window, “here it is unchanged—here, the same sparkling ripple on Lily Pond; every `pulse of wind' and wave is the same as when we were last fishing on it; I can recall every indentation of the shore that Arthur and I followed, mapping out our future; I can point out the trees that we climbed, and the trees we scored together—grown very little taller,” he added, turning his moistened eye to Alice, “like you.” “Take care, Mr. Lisle,” said Grace, “you are on dangerous ground. Alice is sensitive on the point of height. I quote to her my Uncle Walter, who says `the nicest things are done up in the smallest parcels,' and I promise her height shall reach to the stature of the largest heart.” “But you were a tall child,” said Lisle. “I well remember thinking so when you stood on the `high rock,' your little figure relieved against the sky, shouting to Arthur and me to return, as we were going out for an evening's fishing, and take you into the boat.” “I remember it so well; and what a bad child I was, throwing my basket of berries into the lake in my vexation.” Both Archibald and Alice were silent at this point, but both remembered that he kindly rowed back, took her in his arms, coaxed and caressed her into good humor, and carried her home; and Alice remembered that she did not much regret, when fondled in his arms, the loss of the rowing. Again Archibald recurred to the landscape. “There,” he said, “is our dear old pic-nic ground, and the log-bridge. But what is that spire coming up over Simmons' hill, a church?” “Oh, no, that is a saw-mill built since you were here; the very thing the village is in a turmoil about.” “You have made a charming transformation,” said Lisle, after another survey of the premises, “by removing the old barn, making this new approach, and grading the ground to the shore. How have you managed it?—your mother so detested changes.” “And she detests them just as much as ever, but she says, `Youth is stronger than age,' and so she yields to the inevitable. I shall not tell you by what potent charms and spells it has been done. I shall wish it all back in the old way, if it does not seem like home to you. But there comes my mother.” Archibald sprang forward to meet her. “Home is in your mother's face, Alice,” said Grace; “what a harvest radiance it has. I wonder if another generation will show such faces as your mother's and my Uncle Walter's, so full of what the poets call `autumnal beauty,' the traces and records of their beneficient day.” “I don't know,” said Alice, murmuring her words, as if she were thinking aloud, rather than speaking; and while intently watching the meeting of Archibald and her mother, she added, “People never are what you expect, even those you feel most certain of.” Alice was not addicted to talking riddles. Grace looked at her open face, trying in vain to penetrate her meaning. “She is delighted to see Archy,” continued Alice, “that's all right; she is almost as much overcome with joy, as when I brought Max home. How her gladness shines out through her tears, like the sun through a shower—dear mother!” There was something in Alice's accent, and the shake of her head as she made this exclamation, which implied that “dear mother” had said, or felt something that crossed Alice's hope or purpose. Did her quick eye detect the expression of dissatisfaction that shot over her mother's face, as she glanced her eye from Lisle to Miss Herbert? She could not have heard her say, for she hardly spoke above a whisper, “You should have been our only guest for the next month, Archy; it is so long since I have seen you.” An epoch that was to color all Lisle's future life had now arrived; and that our readers may judge him leniently, they must know the misconceptions on which he is about to act. As he was uninformed of Miss Herbert's relations with Copley beyond the point of her engagement to him, he was perplexed by its prolonged secresy, and could see no good reason for it. He had not met Grace since the day of Esterly's departure. He had repeatedly ridden out to Harlem to visit his friend's wife, but had been finally discouraged by the uniform answer to his inquiries “that she did not yet leave her room.” Once he had asked for Miss Herbert at her step-mother's house, and was told that she was at her sister's, without a hint of her permanent abode there. The complete suspension of social intercommunication in New York during the hot months, accounts for his not hearing the fact, the nine days' wonder of her fashionable friends, of Grace having become a paid teacher of music; or their gossiping conjectures in relation to the apparent conclusion of Copley's devotion to her. After Archibald withdrew for the night, he sat down by his open window, and with his eye resting on the moon-lit lake, he gave free course to his thoughts, much as follows: “Keeping this engagement secret must be some arrogant whim of Copley's. The fellow always delighted in silence and darkness, as if by investing himself in mystery he could become a demi-god. An unmotived secret must be repulsive to Grace Herbert's nature, as I once imagined it. Fortunate for me that dear old man told it to me; it was a stunning blow, but it disenchanted me. I ceased to worship from the moment I knew she had declined to his level. And her content seems so absolute, as if, instead of this hateful compromise with the world, she had made safe and noble anchorage, not a venture out at sea. If she were but infatuated; but she is calm and satisfied—satisfied with Copley! “How quietly happy she seems; no more those alternations of spirit and gentleness, of pride and softness, those sudden mutations that, in my blind idolatry I thought so charming, `each a lovelier wonder than the last.' Now she seems so self-forgetting, her brilliancy so softened, like sunshine through a curtained window, in such musical accord with the simplicity of this household, that if I did not know beyond the possibility of doubt that she had trafficked herself away in the market of weak and vulgar women, I should fall back into my old slavery; my old idolatry.” By degrees, as his eye continued on the familiar scenes of his boyhood, his thoughts reverted to Arthur Clifford, and through that medium, to Alice. Lisle had too sound a mind, or rather too sound a faith, to fall into the bad scepticism which doubts the power of any woman to resist seduction to her vanity, or temptation to her poor worldly ambition. The individual had fallen, not the sex. “Dear Arthur!” thought Lisle, “Alice is just such a sister as you would have desired—is she not all that a lover could ask? Would not ninety-nine men in a hundred prefer her with her not too much, nor too little intelligence, her cheerfulness and all the sweetening qualities for every-day life, to Grace Herbert; and shall I be the hundredth to shiver in the shadow of the greatness that is not for me? When poor Letty died, I reproached myself for having forgone a certain and attainable blessing for one unattainable. I am tired of my isolation.” And then he thought, as he had often thought, with a shudder, of the weary waste of life in a boarding-house, of the oozing out of his best affection, of the providence that had from his youth bound him up with the Clifford family, of the long-continued inestimable affection of Alice's mother, of the impulsive—love? No, Archibald would have blushed at that presumption—affection Alice had already manifested for him; and he came to a decision, and was struggling to fortify it against old prepossessions, when his bachelor meditations were interrupted by cautious footsteps on the stairs. Some one entered the room next his, shut the door, and burst into sobbings that it seemed could no longer be suppressed. Soon after, Mrs. Clifford, whose ears were open day and night to the wants of her household, came to the relief of the sufferer, for relief it appeared. The sobbing ceased, and a dejected voice was heard in response to the soothing tone of Mrs. Clifford, which continued far into the night and long after Archibald became oblivious of his neutral-tinted future, and was dreaming of his present bright surroundings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. “There are two republics: a great one, which is human nature; and a less, which is the place where we were born.” When the breakfast-bell rang the next morning, and while the family were assembling, Alice brought in her arms into the breakfast-room a pale, sickly child, and seated her between her mother and herself. The little girl had rather a pleasing face, but spiritless, except for her large dark eyes of singular intelligence. She was four years old, or thereabouts, and from her helplessness (her lower limbs were paralyzed), or from some unknown cause, she seemed to be an object of special interest. Mrs. Clifford, as she took her seat at the head of the table, said, cheerily, “Ah, Daisy, is the world right-side up this morning?” and Alice's eye moistened, as the little girl stretched her arms to her and said, “Give me one kiss for breakfast, my owny, dony Alice.” “Why, who is this?” asked Archibald of Max. “You must not ask me,” replied Max, in a low tone; “that's a secret that mother and Alice have not trusted me with.” Lisle's question was heard, and Max's answer guessed, but neither were noticed, and Lisle, taking the seat allotted to him, next the child, instinctively put his hand on one of her long tresses that, as she shook her head, fell over his sleeve, “Take care!” she said, “don't tumble my curls; my Alice made them so smooth round her finger.” “But why do you shake your head, and toss your curls round at such a rate, Daisy?” asked Max. “I shake it at Amy, 'cause she has put no saucers on the table for the raspberries.” “Shake away, little goddess, you are quite right. I really wish, mother, you would speak to your ne plus-ultra, Amy, about her short-comings.” “Speak to your sister if you please, my son, she set the table this morning; but make no remarks before Amy,” continued Mrs. Clifford, lowering her voice, and glancing at a “parlor-girl” who entered in answer to Max's hasty ring; “and I wish, my son, you would not ring the bell in that way.” Max laughed, as he said aside to Archibald, “My mother always rings the bell as if she were afraid the servants' feeling would be hurt if they heard it.” “Don't you remember Amy?” asked Alice, as the girl disappeared in the pantry to repair her young mistresses' omission. “Amy! Is she the little girl whom your mother brought home with a batch of children, while she watched over their mother, ill with a typhus fever? How could I recognize that little buxom child in this tall, solemn young woman— June in November?” He rose, as the girl returned to the table, and giving her his hand, “Don't you remember me, Amy?” he said. “I hope it is not the custom at Mapleton to forget old friends?” “No, sir,” replied Amy, coldly; “I guess it is not much so.” Amy's spirit was right, but she had the discourteous manner that pervades New England, we are sorry to say, from highest to lowest, and appears in most repulsive ungraciousness in the medium class that, cherishing the right to social equality, is jealous of manifesting any deference that may possibly be interpreted into a confession of inferiority of rank. Amy held, in Mrs. Clifford's family, that anomalous position, defined by the general term, “help.” The relation is scarcely known beyond the rural districts of New England; and now that the Celts monopolize domestic service, and the term “servant” is used, without fear or reproach, it will soon become traditional. It is in such relations as that of Mrs. Clifford to Amy, and to her other humble friends in her rural district, that the most perfect working of our republican institutions is to be seen; and rarely is it to be seen out of New England. But it is hard for young people to divest themselves of a certain respect for what they consider the marks of “genteel life.” “Alice,” said Max, “you are spoiling Amy; why, in the world, should you set the table for her?” “I could hardly do less, Max, when mother went out in the dew, in her stead, and picked those raspberries that you seem to be so mightily enjoying.” “Oh, that's mother's way, to spoil all her servants. Can you imagine such an absurdity, Miss Herbert, as letting a servant sleep, and getting up and doing her work?” “Yes, I have seen like anomalies in my sister Eleanor's ménage; but, Max, I must confess to knowing ladies who would as soon think of building a nest for a bird, as of doing the kind turn Alice has done this morning for Amy.” “And would probably be quite as capable of the one service as the other,” said Mrs. Clifford, looking approvingly, and with surprise at Grace, of whom, as a New York bred lady, she was still distrustful. “Is it true, Miss Herbert,” she added, “as I often hear alleged, that women in our towns live in hotels, to escape the trouble of training and governing domestics?” “I hear so,” said Grace, shrugging her shoulders; “but really I know little of that genus.” “The more gracious your estate, Miss Herbert,” said Lisle. “I have known something of the way of life of such residents in our hotels. I have had two slander suits arising out of it; and nothing can be more inane, gossiping, and deteriorating than it is; `altogether inconvenient,' as Parson Leland said of the infernal regions.” “Capital!” exclaimed Max; “I know all about it. I spent one week, just for the fun of it, with that rascal Gilmore at the—what do you call it? the crack hotel in New York; and the ladies would come to breakfast in their— what do you call them, Alice? Oh, peignoirs; and their skirts flounced and embroidered up to their waists; and they wore diamond ear-rings, and sparkling bracelets, and embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, and all sorts of folderols, in the morning. Don't you call that vulgar, mother?” “Yes, Max; and perhaps even you think it more vulgar than setting the table for Amy?” “Yes indeed, mother. I had rather Alice would wash, scrub, and bake—do any thing at home, all her life, than live as these superfluous women do. Some of them, I guess, began life with washing and scrubbing.” “Nothing is more probable,” said Grace. “It is the sudden fortunes that come upon people unprepared for them, by education or association, that vulgarize our society.” “And yet,” said Mrs. Clifford, “there are those who become suddenly rich who are gentlemen and ladies by inspiration or instinct.” “Yes,” said Archibald, “and I have known some who remain poor, and still are gentlemen by virtue of a refined nature. My father was so in the highest sense of that term, and in every exigency, though he continued to the end of his life to work with carpenter's tools.” “Your father a carpenter, Archy!” exclaimed Max. A smile went round the table at Max's amazement at finding the friend born of “low degree” whom he looked up to as gentle by birth as well as by all manly gifts and accomplishments. His mother was annoyed, and not a little mortified at her son's false notions; but wisely reflecting that observation and experience are better teachers than admonition, she reverted to the subject under discussion. “Nothing strikes me more,” she said, “than our childish impatience with the tasks Providence assigns us. These, willing, strong, warm-hearted Irish, adult children, are sent to our hearth-stones to be taught. We, those of us I mean in medium condition, are qualified teachers. We understand the economies and morals of domestic life, and, with the zeal of missionaries, and at the cost of but a tithe of their labors and sacrifices, we may raise these semi-barbarians to the level of our civilization.” Mrs. Clifford seems not to have been enlightened by the oracle of a late acute English traveler in the United States, who opines that our ladies will be driven into Mormonism by the perplexities of domestic service! Our friend Max belonged to a family where a gentleman was made in the old slow fashion, by at least three generations, and he was in the presence of one of the few representatives of that “ancient and honorable,” and almost forgotten race, an “old family;” and therefore we forgive him the dullness of not seeing the absurdity of attaching importance to hereditary gentility in a country where the “lucifer-match” maker, or the medicinal panacea patentee of this year, may be of the millionaire aristocracy of the next; and where the son of the humblest mechanic, or even of the day-laborer, starts with advantage from a “free academy” in the race for the highest goals in the country. But as we should agree with our young friend that there was too much of indulgence in a household where the maid was permitted to sleep while the mistress did her work—a prodigious exception to all known usages—we must communicate in brief, what Mrs. Clifford imparted in detail to her guests at the first opportunity. The saw-mill which Lisle, at a slight glance from the bay-window, had mistaken for a church, belonged to one Martin Seymour, a thrifty young man in Mapleton, who, in despite of suggestive red hair, and a kindling expression, possessed a kindly, quiet temper. He was Amy's cousin on the maternal side, and in rustic phrase, he was, from childhood, “attached to Amy.” Amy requited his affection, kind for kind, but the course of their true love was roughened by her father, who had accumulated grudges against the Seymours. He and Martin's father married twin sisters, who, it was supposed, would divide equally the heirship of their father's farm; a fair rural property. But the parent's will gave five-sevenths to Seymour's wife, alleging that her husband was “slack,” whereas Goddard was “forehanded.” Goddard looked upon this as a mere pretext of partiality, naturally maintaining that the very fact of his having become “forehanded” qualified him to best husband his father-in-law's estate. We must confess, in dear New England, to an excess of that quality which expands in noble minds to bold speculation and generous enterprise, but is in our rustic population a hateful greed of gain; it is the blot on our escutcheon, the moth and rust that eat into our pure gold. It is this that plucks away the smile from labor, furrows the brow with care, and overshadows all the cheerful charities of life. But grasping as we are, we have few hoarders or spendthrifts; and it must be said in extenuation of this most repulsive characteristic, that the money gained by ceaseless toil and care is transmuted into education, invested in some improvement in husbandry, or bestowed on—or more often bequeathed to—a favorite charity. Goddard's was an exceptional case; he loved money for money's sake; to him it was the motive and the recompense. He had long had his eye upon the mill-site, and had carefully accumulated and set apart dollar by dollar for its purchase; his “castle in the air” was the mill to be erected there, and its productive results were daily calculated. Avarice is a most unsocial passion, and Goddard, like most avaricious men, was cautious and secretive, and did not disclose, till Seymour bought the mill-site, his long-cherished purpose of possessing it. “But providence,” he said, “was set against him. Seymour's boy had overreached him; and,” he added, and Goddard spoke no idle words, “he should live to repent it.” Poor Martin, who had innocently provoked this ire, “not surmising,” as he said, “how Uncle Nat felt about the mill-site till after all the street knew it,” experienced its most cruel consequence in a mandate issued to Amy, forbidding any further “keeping company” with her lover. Amy obeyed to the letter. Early in the morning, before Lisle's arrival in Mapleton, Seymour, on going into his mill, discovered an obstruction in the works, so placed, that, as he said, “if he had not seen it before setting the mill a going, he should have been plunged into eternity, without a minute's warning.” A plunge, even so sudden, would hardly have found Seymour's soul “unanointed.” Without reflection upon causes and agencies, he rushed forth and imparted to his workmen the peril he had escaped. “It's Goddard's work!” one exclaimed. “It can be no body but Goddard,” they all responded. And in spite of Martin's earnest injunction, rumor, that oldest of telegraphs, had carried the news through the village before noon; and before evening, a complaint was entered against Nathaniel Goddard, and he was brought before a magistrate. At this stage of proceedings, Seymour appeared at Mrs. Clifford's, and instead of stealing along the path to the back-door—his usual approach—he boldly entered at the front portal, and heated and flurried, begged to speak in private with Mrs. Clifford. After telling the story of the morning to her, “Every thing is going against Uncle Nat,” he said; “he was seen about the premises last night, and there is more than one witness to testify to his threats against me—poor man! The only chance for us is to get a surety for his future good behavior. Now, Mrs. Clifford, if you will offer that, I don't care what they ask, up to any thing I own or can earn, I will secure you.” “But, Martin, my friend, if you will be so noble to your uncle, why not offer the security in your own name?” “Oh, ma'am, you don't begin to know Uncle Nat; he hates me more than he loves money. Why he'd rather die in State's-prison—and it's a State's-prison offence—than be helped by me. Here is my bond to you, ma'am; Lawyer Flint has written it, and I have signed it.” “But it will seem very odd, Martin, that I should assume such a risk.” “Excuse me, ma'am. The street never thinks any kind deed of Mrs. Clifford's, odd, be it ever so great, or ever so small, a shower or a sprinkle.” “Thank you, Martin; but really I don't fancy making myself a fine bird with your fine feathers.” “Most people,” said Seymour, “are dreadful afraid of seeming worse than they are; I never saw one but you, ma'am, that shyed seeming better. Don't scruple; think of poor Uncle Nat's folks, think of—Amy.” “Ah,” thought Mrs. Clifford, “sits the wind in that quarter?” And smiling, and glancing significantly at Seymour, she hesitated no longer, and while he went another way, she went to the magistrate's office, and when Lisle arrived, she was transacting the business that enabled Goddard to return to his own house, that evening, at liberty. Amy was apprised of the proceedings at the village court, and on the same evening she went to her father's house to ascertain the condition of affairs there. She found her mother in great distress, moaning over her little boy, her “youngest,” who seemed in extremity from an attack of croup. “Oh, I don't mind this,” she said, as Amy took the boy from her arms; “he'll die, of course, Benny will, but that seems nothing; he'd better die, we'd better all die, than live to the disgrace that's coming on us.” “Mother!” cried Amy, “don't talk so; it's all fixed; father is out of trouble.” “Yes, out to-day, Amy; but he'll be in to-morrow.” “My father!” said the little fellow, struggling hard to speak, and looking up fondly at the mention of his name. “Poor little man! how he loves father; where is he, mother?” In her fright about the child, she had not before missed her father. “Gone,” replied the mother, “gone to the mill, I know, for he had his set look on, and I could no more stop him than I could stop the mill-race.” “And did he go, mother, when Benny was breathing so?” “No; that might have stopped him. He was out of call when Benny waked choking.” In a breath Amy had caught up her shawl and rushed out into the night. She went, by a cross-cut, through a dark and tangled wood, to the mill. The moon had not risen; the stars gave a faint light as Amy, emerging from behind the interlacing branches of the trees, described a man just entering the mill. She sprang forward, grasped his arms with both her hands, and cried, “Father! what is father here for?” He shook her off, and said, fiercely, “What are you dogging me here for?” “I am not dogging you, sir,” she answered, with habitual respect; “mother thought you might be here.” “D—n her! what business had she to think about it?” “Don't, please, to speak so, father; mother is in trouble: Benny has got one of his croups.” “Benny?” “Yes, sir; and it seems as if he would die. I never saw him choke so; he tried to speak, and all I could make out was `Father! father!' Oh, do go to him, sir, and I'll go for the doctor.” Amy well knew the motive she urged—Goddard's love for his “youngest” was the one star shining through a pestilent congregation of vapors. The poor man said not another word, but turned from the mill, and rushed through the wood. This time love was stronger than hate. Amy did as she said. She went for the doctor; and it was not till after she had again been at home, and seen the child relieved, and sleeping in his father's arms, that Lisle had overheard her giving vent to her full heart by sobs and tears in her own room. She was quieted by the ascendancy of her beloved mistress over her; but she was not reassured. She knew the hopeless determination of her father's temper, and believed that the evil day, however deferred, must come. The antagonisms of love and hate, generosity and covetousness, enact their tragedies even in humble rural life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. “Oh! how full of briars is this working-day world!” Grace was sitting by a table with her open portfolio upon it, and a pencil in her hand; and so she had been sitting for a half hour without making a stroke with it, and lost in a reverie, when Lisle joined her. Whether her start and the blush that suffused her cheek as he entered, indicated that he had any part in her reverie, must be left to conjecture. Lisle asked “if the charming country about them had induced her to make any sketches since she came to Mapleton?” “A few,” she replied, “of the loveliest objects here. These are my best sketches from nature,” she added, taking several from her portfolio, and giving one to Lisle; “perhaps I think so because I love my subject, and on that score it should find favor with”—you was on her lips, but she mended and extended her phrase, and added, “with every one of this household. You see I have sketched from life,” she continued, as Archibald, with a most admiring expression, gazed at the drawing, murmuring, “How like! how graceful! how beautiful!” “Nothing,” said Grace, “has struck me more in Alice than the patience and sweetness of her devotion to Daisy, a most exacting, fretful, exhausting child. I could not do any justice to my subject by a mere pencil-sketch, but imagine VOL. II. 9 Alice as I saw her. She was cutting flowers from the tall shrub beside the porch, when she discovered a bird's nest, and called to Amy to bring the child out that she might see it. She had her garden-scissors in one hand, as you see, and her little hoe in the other; but oh, dear! the sketch gives no idea of the picture she was, except, perhaps, of the grace of her attitude, as she put aside the branches with her hand —thanks to her for the pretty model—and her sweet smile; I have got that, have I not?” “In perfection!” replied Lisle, with enthusiastic emphasis. One could not tell whether it were the artist or the subject he most admired. “You must tax your imagination, Mr. Lisle, for the coloring; you know her garden-hat, and can imagine how beautifully her heightened color contrasted with its ivy-wreath, and the deep green ribbon with which she ties it. Here is another sketch that I like better, as it exhibits more impressively the patience to which I have nothing akin, and which, therefore, perhaps, strikes me as preternatural. Poor little Daisy was more out of humor, more impish than usual, and Alice, after exhausting all other resources, sat down on the floor beside her, and suffered her to pull out her comb, and unbraid, maul, and tangle her hair at will. As you have only seen it confined, you have no idea of its abundance, of what a mass of waving beauty it is—you see how it sweeps the floor; and while she was enduring this teasing torture, she was intently reading—a volume of the `Promessi Sposi' in the original. And here,” she added, taking still another drawing from the portfolio, “here is another, a pendant for the last, if I am ever called on to illustrate the daily occupations—the arts and domestic arts—of a New England young lady. Here is Alice again with her wealth of tresses neatly tucked up under a morning-cap, her sleeves rolled quite above her dimpled elbows, her white apron tied over her breakfast gingham, bending over a marble `paste-board,' where she works many domestic spells, such as Eve did in paradise, involving the fruits of her garden in flaky paste, `tempering dulcet creams,' etc., etc. How often I wish my Uncle Walter were here; such a blending of le beau et l'utile as there is in Alice's life would enchant him, it enchants all men, I think.” Grace raised her eyes from the drawing to Archibald's face; his eye met hers and he blushed (Lisle's youthful infirmity of blushing had of late returned upon him); he blushed as if on the verge of betraying a secret; he started too, as if awakened from a dream, and Grace, giving to the blush, and the start, and the very grave look, her own interpretation, said, “I see, as I foresaw —my subject imparts a value to my sketches; if you like them pray keep them, they may prove pleasant souvenirs hereafter.” He thanked her, rather coolly, as she thought, and then suddenly recollected that Alice had sent him to ask her to go with him on an errand to Goddard's. While she went for her hat, Lisle stood musing over the sketches, and handling them with the true feeling of a lover, as if Grace's touch had consecrated them. “What an exquisite perception she has,” he thought, “what talent to express so much of Alice's attractive graces in these slight sketches! Yes, yes, Alice is made and trained for the best married life, and he who wins her should esteem himself most happy.” But Lisle did not seem as if he were gazing upon a paradise in perspective, and he was half way to Goddard's before the sun had risen above the clouds around his horizon. But he did cast his care behind him, and yielded for the hour without further resistance to the magic of Grace Herbert's charms; and again in his world she, for the time, shone and ruled alone. Grace, utterly unconscious of the feeling she inspired, blinded partly by her past reserved intercourse with Lisle, and partly by her conviction that Alice was his destiny, gave free rein to her natural frankness and earnestness; and thus with every hour put a new rivet in poor Lisle's chains. Lisle would pause in the midst of a delightful conversation with her, with a feeling akin to that which one who has long, in silence and awe, knelt and worshiped before his divinity, might have, if that idol were suddenly to awake to human sympathy and bestow a sweet, familiar, condescending smile upon him. Certainly, a striking change was wrought in Grace; she had arrived at one of those rare and short intervals in any life, blessed with unclouded serenity. If a storm were gathering, she had no forebodings. Her's was the thoughtful happiness consequent upon having finished a painful experience, escaped a great peril, and opened with a holy purpose a new chapter of life. Though her intents and aspirations were higher and more distinct than ever before, she had a touching softness and gentleness of manner not natural to her; it indicated the genuine humility that springs from past failure. Humility is the angel of that furnace in which the gold becomes fine gold. For the first time in her life she had worked, and she now felt the sweetness of rest purchased by labor; the air of the hill-country was inspiring; the common events of every day, the little accidents of household life, had a surprise and a new charm for her, like light through tinted glass; and the simplicity and freedom of social intercourse at Mapleton were a revelation to her, contrasting as they did with the only country life she had ever tasted (a loathsome dose, she called it) when she went with Mrs. Herbert and Anne Carlton to spend the hot months at watering-places. She was now beyond the fretting discords of their society, and en rapport with the people around her. We beg the loan of this mystical phrase, to express the instinctive sympathy between characters, however variously modified, which have the same basis. With all the ardor of her impulsive feelings, that were too apt to rise above the high-water mark of reason and rationality, Grace had (so she believed) renounced love forever. She had come to the station where she must make the decision, “married or single?” and recoiling from the first, as a burnt child dreads the fire, she would entrench herself in the safety of the last. “I can not live without affection,” she thought; “but is not that a harvest sure to the sower's hand? and have I not Eleanor, and Frank, and their children, and dear Alice, with her ardent, self-forgetting, too partial love? and by-and-by, when Archibald Lisle is her husband, I shall get the better of his prepossessions, and, alas! his just judgment against me, and conquer his brotherly affection.” But it was not merely in a selfish point of view that Grace Herbert contemplated her future. She knew that God had instituted relations, and human dependencies, had so bound man to man, had made the happiness of one so dependent on the happiness of another, that no one could sunder the tie and live, in the highest sense of that significant word; and having withdrawn her maiden meditations from their natural subject, she was surveying, with characteristic ardor, the vast fields of dignified occupation and blessed benevolence patent to a single woman. We rather think that this sincere mapping of the future was suspended by the insidious pleasure of the long morning walk with Lisle. Before they returned from their mission to Goddard's, Alice and her mother, having disposed of their domestic concerns, met in the sitting-room, where Daisy, on a low chair, in the midst of rejected play-things, was fretting as usual. “Alice,” she said, pettishly, “Pixie is getting to be such a naughty dog—he does not mind me a scrap; I have told him, ever so many times, to bring me my doll, and he won't.” “Here it is, my darling; don't scold Pixie. Poor Pix, he is a little lame, and very dull, since we came home.” “Pixie lame! How happened that, Alice?” asked her mother. “Oh! did I not tell you that I saw le pèrre (looking significantly at the child) in New York. It was just as I was going into that horrid prison, where poor Max was, that a man passed, muffled in his cloak up to his eyes: Pixie ran after him, and I suppose snapped at his heels, for the man turned and gave him a brutal blow with his cane; and that, together with something the good matron, Mrs. Barton, told me, made me think it must be he.” “I hope not,” rejoined Mrs. Clifford; “but I should not wonder if he were waiting, and watching there for the opportunity of a violent revenge.” “Mother! do you think so?” exclaimed Alice, in a tone very different from the cool one in which her mother had suggested an every-day probability. “Why, Alice,” said the child, over whom Alice was bending, “have you got your tooth-ache again?” Her mother's words had shot a sharper pang through Alice's heart than the touch of the nerve of a tooth inflicts. Her mother did not see her suffused face, and she proceeded, without suspicion. “Why, my dear child,” she asked, “did you say any thing to Max about that person? You know we agreed on perfect silence as the only security, and Max is so reckless.” Alice explained that her brother's mention of Maltby was in another connection than their's with him, and reminded her mother that she had never relieved their neighbors' curiosity, in relation to the mystery of the child. “I think,” she said, “it has died out, of inanition.” “You have been a miracle of prudence, my dear child.” Mrs. Clifford was yet to learn that this, like many other assumed miracles, was explicable by natural causes. “Oh dear!” exclaimed Daisy, “I wish they would not come back.” “`They'—who do you mean, Daisy?” “Why, they,” she replied, pointing to Grace and Archibald, who had just emerged from the wood; “you don't play with me all the time when they are here.” “No, Daisy, you have a rival now,” said Mrs. Clifford; “and to tell the truth, I wish her away as much as you do.” “Mother—dear mother!” exclaimed Alice. “I can't help it, my dear child; I beg your pardon, but I do. What does this mean?” she added, looking out at the door, “little Benny is with them. How did they find their way to Goddard's?” “I directed Archy. I knew you wanted to send up the croup-syrup you made against Benny's next attack; I was sure they would have a lovely walk this delicious morning along the lake, and it would not much matter if they did lose their way.” Mrs. Clifford looked, she did not say it, “Oh, my child, you are losing your way!” After a moment's silence, “See, mother,” exclaimed Alice, “Archy has made little Ben a bow and arrow—how kind! Aren't they altogether a lovely picture? if you would only see Grace with my eyes.” Grace had sat down in a rustic chair under a sugar-maple, whose massive foliage excluded every ray of the August sun. Her cheek crimsoned by exercise, and her expressive face, lit up by happiness, justified Alice's exclamation. Archibald was half recumbent on the turf at her feet. The rustic boy was kneeling before them, aiming his arrow at a bird on the wing. “Ah,” murmured Mrs. Clifford, “if Archy were only as safe as the bird!” “Archy is not aimed at, mother.” “I am not so sure of that, Alice. I heard you repeating to Miss Herbert Archy's extravagant admiration of her voice, and his telling you that he once heard her quote and `set to music' by her delicious voice Bryant's `Waterfowl.' If I do not mistake it is your Bryant she is now reading to him—she is a practised woman.” Mrs. Clifford shook her head distrustfully. “Mother, you do misunderstand her. She is not reading from vanity, or to charm Archy, except by the poetry; she maintains that Bryant is our `truest poet and our best;' to this Archy assents, but he is not quite prepared to agree with her that there is not a poet in the English language who mirrors nature with more absolute truth and beauty. Like our deep still mountain lakes, he gives back the sky, the trees, the least little floweret on their brim, without changing the tint of a leaf, or deepening a shadow; not presuming to improve by artistic elaboration the divine work. This Grace said, mother, and she took the poems with her to-day to test them in their own atmosphere, as you would a portrait by its original.” “Vanity is `the most subtle beast of the field,' my child; a complex artificial character like Miss Herbert's is quite out of your ken, Alice.” “No, mother; it is you that have dimmed your mental eye-sight by straining it to look too far. Grace has infinite variety, but that does not involve dissimulation or affectation of any sort. She has not our air-line, unadorned ways, but she is as true as we are. She is all sweetness, nobleness; she is—she is glorious.” Mrs. Clifford listened coldly, and Alice felt as if she were plunged into a snow-bank, when her mother interrupted her with, “Don't rant in such a school-girl fashion, Alice; you are quite carried away with the condescensions of this town-bred belle.” “`Belle!' what a name to apply to Grace Herbert. `Condescensions!' that's hardly kind or just, mother. Has she not always treated me as if I were every way her equal? Poor little me!—have I not always loved her?” “Yes, as girls love and worship the idols of their imaginations. You were but a chit when you were together at Canda's, and you then adored her as girls do a young lady senior, especially if she have the advantage of beauty and fashion. Your correspondence since has had the interest of intimacy without the disenchantment of personal intercourse. I have no faith in amies inconnues.” “`Inconnues!' mother; have we not maintained a constant correspondence? Grace's letters are a history of her life, and a perfect revelation of her character.” “Like some other revelations—made only to the believing.” “You know why I have not shown them to you, dear mother; there was always something confidential in them.” “I know—about that fellow Copley. Why don't they wind up their affairs? Such shilly-shally does not argue any great superiority on Miss Herbert's part.” “If I could only tell you all about that affair, mother— but I must not. Thus much I may venture to say, I am sure it will never come to any thing.” “I am very sorry for it.” “Mother,” said Alice, playfully, laying her hand on her mother's shoulders and looking steadfastly in her face, “has not some conjuror changed my generous, candid mother for a purblind old lady? Now you know Copley is not worthy of Grace, and you know it from your oracle, Archy who, long ago, gave you such a mean opinion of him.” “And I still hold that opinion; but `he belongs,' as we say, `to Miss Herbert's congregation.' In the trashy society she lives in, I doubt if she could do much better.” “You forget that your paragon makes one of that society.” 9* “That is accidental. His relations with it began with the accident of a professional service for the Herberts.” “And has been a long time maintained, dear mother, by a `casual concurrence of calamitous circumstances.'” She smiled archly; her mother in no wise returned the smile. “The crowning `accident' of their acquaintance,” continued Alice, “is their meeting here—`there is a tide in the affairs of men,' you know, dear mother, and of women too.” “Poor child!” thought Mrs. Clifford, “can she be in earnest in persisting in this idea?” Alice was in earnest. Many a warm, true-hearted young girl's love for another girl approximates, as did Alice's, to worship. To her ardent fancies there was one other mortal not to be graduated by an ordinary scale, and that other being a captivating young man, and now brought with Grace to the romantic accessories of Mapleton, at the moment that she was providentially unshackled, the hour had come when they were to go straight forward to that goal, to which heaven as well as she, poor little Fate, Alice, had predestined them. The pause in the mother's and daughter's colloquy was broken by Daisy calling out to Alice, “Do please carry me out where that little boy is. I don't want to sit here forever.” Alice lifted the helpless creature in her arms, and caressed her tenderly. “You forgot me,” she said, “did not you, Alice?” Alice reassured her, and removed her and her playthings to join the group under the maple-tree. Her mother looking after her said mentally, “Yes, poor foolish child, she forgets even herself. At this critical moment, from a mere girlish fondness, she is playing into the hands of that potent woman of the world, who, indeed, could win the game without my poor little girl's help. Oh, Alice! Alice! you are throwing away the richest chance of your life; and I have wasted so many hopes and purposes, and little plottings—heaven forgive me!” So much has been said and written against “manœuvring mothers,” that it requires some boldness to betray the fact that Mrs. Clifford had hoped to promote the union of her daughter with Lisle, by bringing them together at Mapleton. A mother may plod and plot day and night to secure for her daughter an advantage of education; she may compass sea and land to promote her health, and toil and save to augment her fortune; but when it comes to the great event on which her character and true prosperity, the welfare of soul, body, and estate, mainly depend, the mother—the heaven-appointed guardian—must not lift a finger, but must stand back, and wait on time and chance. Mrs. Clifford had loved Archibald from his boyhood, and after the death of her son Arthur, this affection became as strong and sensitive as if a maternal instinct, and as sacred as a religious duty. She had watched with infinite satisfaction over Lisle's career. She had gathered from his letters—the almost preternatural sagacity of a woman in such affairs being rendered more acute by her personal interest—that Miss Herbert's intimacy with Copley had, in breaking Lisle's confidence in her, dispelled her charm for him; and now that at the moment a fair field was opened for Alice, when it seemed so natural, inevitable, that her favorite, prepossessed in her favor, finding all he had loved in the child ripened in the woman, her domestic education answering to his wants, her qualities and tastes so in accordance with his own; that her sweet and loveable child should be overshadowed, her mild effulgence dimmed in a more dazzling light, was more than Mrs. Clifford could bear, human as she was, without some injustice to her who was thus thwarting her. We feel bound, as we have been compelled to expose Mrs. Clifford's prejudices, to say that they were not wholly personal to Miss Herbert. She regarded her as coming from an “infected district.” She looked upon the fashionable society of New York much as it has been portrayed by certain popular writers, and if she did not believe that every fashionable woman is a “Mrs. Potiphar,” she did hold them all to be vain, vapid, wearisome, and superfluous, and honestly believed that the world would be all the better if they were swept out of it. And therefore, independent of her secret deprecation of Miss Herbert's visit at this juncture, she dreaded the contagion of the fine-lady tastes and habits that would in no wise harmonize with Alice's life. Mrs. Clifford, too, was shy of new friends. She loved her old ones, often for no better reason than that they were “old ones.” She loved the country, as a child loves its mother. She loved old books; like dear “Cousin Bridget,” she “browsed” on old English literature. Johnson and his club, Pope and his cotemporaries were to her like familiar friends. Her romantic reading did not date later than the blessed era of the “great unknown;” it was a joke among her gossips that the only time she ever fainted was, when she discovered a novel of Madam George Sand in Alice's hands. She rather thought it lost time to read any later poet than Pope, except Bryant. A copy of his poems, that had belonged to her son Arthur, was kept with her Bible on the table of her private sitting-room. Her social prejudices were nurtured by the charming society of Mapleton, small, but eclectic, consisting, as in most of our New England villages, chiefly of women; some few living in happy conjugal life; some honoring the past by a modest and dignified widowhood; and some maidens, “not young,” who, as was pithily said of them by a married cotemporary, “having as much happiness and more usefulness than usually belongs to married life, were occupied in the certain good of relieving the poor mortals already here, instead of the uncertain benefit of bringing others into the world, who might not find it well to be in it.” But this vicarious maternity was not their sole occupation. There was a healthy vigorous intellectual life among them, free from literary ambition, but not without adornment. Accident having thrown some political exiles of the highest order, upon their kindness, the young women “followed the arts,” and while acquiring music, German and Italian, they naturally imbibed the generous political creeds of which their teachers were the apostles and martyrs. Mrs. Clifford, in regard to Alice, gave in to these “foreign trimmings,” as she called them, not that she valued the garniture, but that she thus gave “material aid” in the most delicate mode in which it could be imparted. So it became common law in Mapleton that the credential of a foreign teacher there must be a diploma from an Austrian fortress prison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. “It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.” Those are said to be the happiest days of our lives of which there is least to record. Least, perhaps, to be published, but not least to be cherished in grateful remembrance. Who counts the drops that compose the shower which sustains the vitality of nature? And who sets down the bright “good-mornings,” and the peaceful “good-nights” of family life?—the morning prayer, and the evening blessing, the interchange of innumerable good words, and offices of affection?—the look-outs into the beautiful and ever changing face of nature?—the three times gathering round the table, where mind and heart, as well as body, find their food?—the meetings and the partings enriched by love?—the books that vitalize and cheer the lives of high and humble?—the responsive smiles, the recreative laughs, the shouts, caresses, and fresh sayings (original poetry) of children?—the arrival of friends, and the coming in of the daily mail? Where are the blanks but in the thankless heart? There were no startling events during the three happy weeks that followed Archibald's arrival at Mapleton. The earth is still, and may seem dead, when beneath its surface are elaborating processes that are to deck it with blossoms, and hang fruit on its trees. These three short uneventful weeks, if measured by the æsthetic mode of sensations, were the longest in the lives of our friends. The busily idle days were never tedious. They wiled the hours away over their favorite authors, equally content whether they agreed or differed. Village hospitalities were exchanged without the gène of ceremony, or the folly of pretension. The early dewy mornings found Lisle and Alice mounted for a ride. Alice was a famous horse-woman—Grace remarked to her now thrice happy mother, that none of her accomplishments were lost on Lisle. The evenings were passed in moon-lit strolls, or gatherings on piazzas, where some talked, and others listened to music. Every house had its piano, and Grace frankly confessed, that her vanity had been rebuked by finding in a rural district those quite as accomplished as herself, in the “art and mystery” of music. Tête-à-tête rides and drives in countries of an older civilization than ours might be excepted to, but it seemed not even to occur to the most fastidious spinster in Mapleton, that there was the slightest impropriety in their young friends charming away the hours among the hills. So they went, Archibald and Alice, or Archibald and Grace, or all together, unscathed by gossip's tongue, “To the beautiful streamlet by the village side, That windeth away from the haunts of men, To quiet valley and shaded glen;” or they winded up through the forest path to that “Narrow battlement” whence “Sheer to the vale go down the bare old cliffs, Huge pillars that in middle heaven upbear Their weather-beaten capitals.” It must be confessed there was an atmosphere about these scenes very favorable to the growth of that little flower called “Love-in-idleness.” Lisle's position with these two young women, each supremely charming in her own way, would seem a very dubious one, but it was quite plain that no vulgar observer could liken him to the vacillating animal between the two bundles of hay. It was apparent which he had elected for his “daily food.” If there were moments when the old habits of his heart mastered him, and when as the blood rushed to his cheek, and an inevitable smile played on his lips at some beaming charm of Grace, he found himself involuntarily at her side, oblivious of Alice's presence, all his devotions aforethought were to Alice, and Grace, for the first time in her life was left to enact the subordinate part of an observer. Lisle's predetermined, and therefore now duteous devotion to Alice, left Grace much to Mrs. Clifford's companionship. The mother's prejudices were fused and transfused in her felicitous assurance of the fulfilment of her hopes. From doubting the justice of her prejudices she soon came to wonder she had ever entertained them. The moment the obstruction was removed, the natural sympathy between the young lady and her elder was manifest. They both belonged to the family of the “Great Hearts.” One evening, just before the serving of tea, the letters and papers were brought from the mail. Lisle, with the keen appetite of all American mankind for works of this genus, had seized a newspaper, and was running his eye over it. “Do you find any news, Archy?” asked Mrs. Clifford. “No, nothing of any consequence,” he replied, as people usually do, who first get possession of a fresh paper, unless it chance to contain something as startling as a revolution, or a murder among one's acquaintance. “Oh, yes,” he added, “here are `readings for the ladies,' a description of a `fancy ball' at Newport; shall I read it?” “Do read it, Archy,” replied Alice, eagerly. “Alice has not got beyond `readings for very young ladies,'” said her mother; “but you may read it, Archy; Grace and I will endure it.” Lisle exchanged smiles with Alice, and proceeded to read the details of the royal, sacerdotal, and heroic characters assumed by the beaus and belles of our cities congregated at the watering-place of highest fashion. The initials only of the real names were given, and as Lisle read them, Grace, who was familiar with the names of most of the notorieties of the fashionable world, filled up the blanks. “Decidedly the most dazzling star in this brilliant galaxy”—we quote the paragraph, whose style might be termed adjective—“was the fair young lady who personated the superb Queen Elizabeth. The ugly old Queen would have bartered all the unmatchable jewels of her regalia for the youth, grace, and beauty of her counterfeit. The choice of this character, much criticized by certain coteries, was (we humbly surmise) determined by its relation to the noble Leicester. The beauty, brilliancy, gorgeousness, sublimity, and set of the earl's costume, were never exceeded in any country. The diamonds were said to be of the first water, and the point lace, and ermine were beyond dispute real—” “Oh, pray stop, Archy,” cried Mrs. Clifford; “what fools our people are.” “There is ever so much more, Alice—all the romance— but your mother won't hear it. Oh permit me, Mrs. Clifford—just this.” He read on: “`As in our happy land there are no musty laws, or malicious lieges to impede royal connubial happiness, rumor reports that the hymeneal altar will soon be lighted to unite the fortunate Mr. C—y to the beautiful Miss C—n.' Who should they be, Miss Herbert?” honestly asked Lisle. A painful pervading blush overspread Grace's cheek. Lisle saw it, and wished his question unasked. Grace saw that he observed it, and perhaps she divined the rapid process of his mind, for she answered, and without faltering, “Mr. Copley and Miss Carlton.” Alice, when Lisle hesitated, had risen to see for herself, and was looking over his shoulder, her eye riveted to the paper, when the “speechless messages” passed between him and Grace. Not at the trashy report of the ball was she looking; another column of the paper had caught her eye. The color faded from her cheek, and Lisle might have heard the beating of her heart. She rushed out of the open door, and sank down upon the seat under the maple-tree. Neither her mother nor Grace observed any thing unusual in her exit. She was habitually sudden and rapid in her movements. Lisle followed her. He seized her hand; his was tremulous, his voice choking, as he said, “Tell me, dear Alice—for heaven's sake tell me—” “Oh not now,” she cried, interrupting him; “don't ask me now. I will, perhaps, another time.” And snatching away her hand, she sprang from him, and entering the house by another door, went to her own room, locked herself in, and gave way to anxieties she could not repress, and dared not betray. “What a cowardly wretch I am!” exclaimed Lisle, as he walked off to the lake-side. “Shall I ever again have courage to ask if that cursed engagement is suspended, or if any thing has happened to it? No—nothing can. What weakness to let this silly gossip open the door for a moment to thoughts, to hopes, that I had shut out forever.” Some one says that every human being is alone, however intimate may seem the fellowship in which he lives with those around him. Certain it is, that each of the persons but just now gathered around the bay-window, had within their own minds a solitary cell. It was an hour that invites to confidence. When the outer world grows dark, one is more inclined to throw open the windows and doors of the inner. Grace drew a brioche to Mrs. Clifford's feet, sat down, laid her head on Mrs. Clifford's lap, and sighed. Was the sigh drawn forth by the too vivid recollection of the past suggested by the fancy ball? or was there “a little cloud no bigger than my hand” rising in her spirit's clear heaven, at the thought of Alice's “culminating felicity?” “My dear Grace,” began Mrs. Clifford, and paused; but feeling sure of herself, sure that her curiosity was not sharpened by any dread of Grace's interference with her child's future, that it was only prompted by pure concern for this lovely young woman's happiness, she was about to proceed, when Grace looked up, her eyes brimming with tears, a smile quivering on her lips, and said, “Well, what would you say to me? pray say it.” “I will, my dear child, and you shall answer me or not, as you like. I will make no inferences—think no thoughts. I fear you have been pained by that newspaper trash?” Grace did not find it quite so easy to reply as she had imagined it would be. If she answered according to her first impulse, “not in the least,” Mrs. Clifford would naturally rejoin, “what then has disturbed you?” a question she dared not answer to herself. Time was when she would have playfully equivocated. She was less of a world's woman than she had been, much less easily tempted from the narrow way into little convenient detours. As she hesitated, a way of escape opened, and she plunged into it. She raised her head and began, not without faltering, but with a firm purpose to go on. “When first I came to you, Mrs. Clifford,” she said, “Alice begged me to explain to you my relations with Horace Copley; I could not. I did not know you well enough, and I saw plainly that you did not like me.” “My dear Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Clifford, interrupting her, “that was not because—it was because—” “Never mind why it was, or why it was not,” said Grace, smiling, but dreading more to hear the explanation than Mrs. Clifford to make it; “my, why, was very simple. You know we shrink from exposing our follies to those who do not love us. You did not then even like me; but taking to myself the sweet comfort that you do now love me, I will tell you all about the great moral blunder of my life, and then you may judge for yourself how much I can care for that silly gossip.” Here both ladies were startled by sounds from Alice's room. “Is that Alice's voice?” asked Grace. “I thought she was out walking with Mr. Lisle?” “I thought so too,” said her mother, and concerned at the sorrowful tone of Alice's voice, she was going to her, but returned to her seat, saying, “Oh, I understand it. She is soothing Daisy—I can not see into her devotion to that child. She is, to be sure, a piteous little object, but this devotion is so engrossing. There is no personal interest, however strong, that she does not suspend at the call of that child.” “Pity stronger than love, Mrs. Clifford? that was never heard of.” Mrs. Clifford shook her head, smiled, and said, “Go on, Grace; we will not let them interrupt us again.” (We use our privilege to make a parenthetical visit to Alice's apartment. “What ails you, my Alice?” said the fond child, as Alice threw herself on the bed, and hid her streaming eyes on the child's bosom. “Nothing ails me, Daisy,” she replied, “nothing.” “Nothing! what a story, Alice. Only foolish little children cry for nothing, not grown-up ladies; and you know who said so when he shut me in the closet. Don't cry, my own Alice.” “I will not, darling,” said Alice, smiling, or trying to smile through her tears; “we'll neither of us cry, till we must—poor Daisy.”) At the conclusion of Grace's relation to Mrs. Clifford, which was made without any glosses, she said, “There it is, dear Mrs. Clifford—the history of my lost years.” “Lost! don't call them so. You have reaped a precious harvest, and thrown the chaff away.” “No, Mrs. Clifford, not so; my convictions are too strong to yield to the soothing of your affection, wise and good as you are; and so good that you cannot understand the evil nurtured by such a life as mine has been, the subordination of every noble aim to frivolity, self-indulgence, and littlenesses of all sorts. You may allow something for the spell the man wrought upon me, which truly I cannot conjure up again by any effort of imagination, or even of memory. I was the victim of an illness that could only prevail in a vitiated atmosphere. I saw through my step-mother's poor little artifices to blind me, that she was trying to circumvent me. I knew it was the ambition of Anne Carlton's life to marry Horace Copley, and worst of all, he played her off against me, and made me a party to the wretched game. And I went on, from year to year, fancying and trying to find the qualities, the virtues that should justify me to my own self-respect. It was the common childish folly of self-blinding, self-cheating.” “Thank God, you were saved, dear Grace.” “I do thank God for it, Mrs. Clifford. How long I repelled the teachings and aids of His providence. There was the admonition of my sister's life, of her true marriage, and yet I looked down upon her Christian course as a very humble career, no model for me. True, there were few men in our set calculated to instruct my judgment or elevate my taste.” “But you knew Archibald Lisle?” interposed Mrs. Clifford, involuntarily recurring to her paragon. “Yes, he was occasionally thrown in my way”—Grace's voice sensibly faltered—“and I confess light and darkness are not more different than he and Copley. I did not heed the contrast; no, it was not till Mrs. Tallis' disclosure, when my own follies were mirrored in hers, as in a magnifying-glass, that I recoiled. A fountain of life sprang from her sorrow, and in her darkened chamber we both `saw light.'” Mrs. Clifford had been tempted to interrupt Grace, to remonstrate against her self-condemnation, to give words of her own conviction of the nobleness of Grace's nature, which impressed her far more than the weaknesses she so courageously unveiled, but she had too much respect for the offices of conscience to interfere with them, so she stifled the words that her heart sent to her lips, and said, “So, my dear child, you and poor Mrs. Tallis dropped your `load,' and pressed on to the delectable city.” “This is our purpose. She has helpful company—I must go the long way alone.” “Aone, Grace! You surely have not made a vow to that effect?” “No, not a vow, but a resolution springing from conviction. After my age, you know, Mrs. Clifford, the affections lose something of their flexibility, the requisitions are more severe, and the chances of marriage much more rare.” “You are three-and-twenty, I believe?” said Mrs. Clifford, with a dissenting smile. “Yes, just three-and-twenty.” “Well, upon consideration, I believe you are right. The chances are fewer, but, like the Sybil leaves, the richer for those that are lost.” “But you admit there is small probability of such a marriage as now would alone content me, a marriage like that of which our Alice is on the threshold, where to the enchantments of love is added a trust in character so secure that there can be no after falling from that grace.” “My dear child, the world would soon come to an end with this refining. Would you prohibit all inferior unions?” “If I could? No, marriage is a general law, and divine, and therefore with all its abuses far more good than evil comes of it.” “Yes, yes, Grace,” exclaimed Mrs. Clifford, the sudden clouding of her face betraying the pang of grievous memories, “if one must go through life with the ever fresh sense of irreparable loss, there is left the blessed compensation of children, the holy relation of brother and sister, the vital charities of home. And after all,” she continued, her voice resuming its ordinary tone of cheerfulness, “after all, I believe matrimonial disturbances are for the most part among idle people. They rarely occur in the middle classes. To be sure, marriage is rather a coarse partnership there, but it is surprising how evenly they trudge on through life together. Why, Grace, our rustic people generally regard single life as not only helpless and joyless, but almost ridiculous.” “Then, dear Mrs. Clifford, is it not high time that better opinions should prevail? As slaves must be trained for freedom, so women must be educated for usefulness, independence, and contentment in single life. They must look forward to it, not quite as I do, perhaps, as the only alternative to the happiest married life—that is my idiot-syncrasy as you would term it—but as a mode of life in which one may serve God and humanity, and thus educate the soul, the great purpose of this short life. So considered, single life would not long be regarded as either `helpless, joyless, or ridiculous,' and that dreaded stigma, `old maid,' would soon cease to be a stigma, and in the lapse of ages possibly become obsolete.” “Oh, as to that, Grace, I know as many of the real scarecrows, the ideal `old maids' among pretentious, sickly, fussy, gossiping, crabbed wives as can be found among single women from Maine to Georgia. And I have known old maids who have sustained to the end the doctrine of `perseverance of (single) saints,' inclining me to the opinion of one of my married friends, who says, that it is because matches are made in heaven that some of the loveliest women are exempted from the—curse, she called it. That is going a little further than you do, Grace?” “Yes, I only ask that single life should be made a blessing.” “And a choice, Grace?” “Yes, a choice in many positions, the chances being against a satisfactory marriage.” “Oh, my dear child, what is quite satisfactory in life? it's all a compromise.” “I hate compromises, Mrs. Clifford.” “Just what I heard Archy say, yesterday, and just so emphatically, not to say bitterly; and here he comes, and you may finish the discussion with him, while I go and look for Alice.” “She,” thought the joyful mother, “is sure of the happiest married life, and Grace—well—if single, her life will be a beautiful one, but it's rather premature at three-and-twenty to set the seal upon it.” “Finish the discussion with Archibald Lisle?” thought Grace. She did not allude to it, or to any thing that bore the remotest relation to it. It mattered not what trifle “light as air,” she and Lisle now talked of when they were tête-à-tête, there was a certain thrill and mellowness in the tones of their voices that, if our readers have ever felt or observed, they know how much more is expressed than meets the ear. Grace sat looking out at one window, Lisle at the other. The twilight deepened into night. Nothing more startling was said than, “The dew is heavy this evening;” “There is a new moon;” or, “Is that planet Jupiter?” Yet they sat immoveable, dreading an approaching footstep. An opened paradise would not have tempted either to leave the other, and still, Archibald felt much like the poor wretch who knows the peril of lingering near the draught he has forsworn. Grace had the solace of believing that she periled no one's happiness but her own. But Archibald Lisle was not a man to be turned from a purpose he had deliberately and conscientiously formed, nor voluntarily to yield himself to the charm of one woman when he had indicated allegiance to another; and when Alice opened the door, and instinctively drew back, and then, to cover her involuntary movement, said, “How stupidly you are sitting here;” he replied, “Waiting for you, Alice. The evening is lovely; will you take a row on the lake?” “The boat is not there, Archy. Mother lent it this afternoon—she is always lending it.” “I know the large boat is out, but Max's sulky is there. That carries two.” “And we are to go, and leave Grace?” “Miss Herbert just remarked the dew was heavy, and—” “Oh, that won't do, Archy. My life, in a way, is of some value too.” Then changing her play to earnest, “You will go, dear Grace,” she said. “I will bring your shawl.” And with her fleet foot, she was running to Grace's room, when she called out, “Come back, Alice. I shall not go out this evening. And,” she added, in a tone which Archibald thought superfluously frigid—to Alice's ear it betrayed pique—“I beg you not to abridge Mr. Lisle's pleasure. I VOL. II. 10 have letters to write, and shall not see you again. So, good-night to you both.” Alice whispered emphatically, “Oh, Grace!” And as she impressed on her friend's cheek a “good-night” blessing, she thought “how tiresome of them to keep up this childish play of `hide and go seek.'” Not only fate and reason had seemed to Lisle to govern his decision in his first evening's meditation at Mapleton, but he felt impelled to it by providential suggestions. It was plain to him, and so would have seemed to any observer, that Alice's affection might soon be ripened into love. She was certainly more than he deserved, and he persuaded himself that, in addition to all others, “most excellent reasons,” loyalty to his departed friend demanded that he should throw himself at the feet of that friend's sister, and not sulkily turn his back upon so rich a destiny. But, alas! what weak auxiliaries are reason and reflection against the absolutism of a long indulged love. From his first meeting with Grace Herbert, to the present moment, she had been to him like the sun of a polar summer; and at Mapleton, unclouded by the obstructions of her town life, her light had continually shone, giving an enchanting lustre to his world. Still, “she is not what she seems,” he incessantly repeated to himself, “and if she were, she is lost to me. Once pledged to Alice, duty will strengthen me, and I shall break these bonds that I now struggle in vain with.” So for the last three days he had sought an opportunity of asking what he felt quite too sure of getting. Opportunities came, and were permitted to pass. Now, out on the lake he looked up to the polar star, and mentally symbolizing, thought there could not be a truer guide than the dear little girl beside him. She sat, too, pensively looking at the stars, making of them, also, perhaps, types of her heart's mysteries. “Alice,” Lisle said, in a low voice. Alice started, recalled from a world of her own fond dreaming, and as he hesitated, “Well, Archy, what is it?” she asked. “Is that star just setting, Mars?” “Mars! Why, Archy, what are you thinking about?” That was just what he, for the last half hour, had been trying to tell. “No, indeed,” continued Alice, “that is the evening-star, Venus. I have been watching her, and wondering if in all the latitudes of our continent she is now the evening-star. Can you tell me?” “No, I am sure I can not; but why do you wish to know?” “Oh if I could tell you, Archy!” she exclaimed, her manner becoming intensely earnest. “I wish I could,” she added, and her tears flowing; “but I cannot now—I can not.” Archibald was sorely perplexed; occupied with his own anxieties (forgive an egotism rare to him), he fancied she must have some, he knew not what reference to him, and he was relieved when she added, “Do let us go home, Archy. We have both been very stupid, and now we are something worse; but don't speak to me again, Archy—I had rather you would not.” Lisle did not, and he rowed to the shore, feeling (it is a simile somewhat musty) like a shrinking, cowardly wretch, who hears at the dentist's door, “He's not at home.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. “There's mischief brewing.” We return to poor Amy. The humblest have their own world of day and night, sunshine and storm. Amy had gone on quietly with her duties since her encounter with her father at the mill. Conscious that her anxieties implied distrust of her father, she buried them in her own bosom. When Goddard, knowing the rectitude of his child, had endeavored to exact a promise from her to give up Seymour forever, she, with the caution which our Puritan people seldom lose sight of, replied, “I promise to give him up, sir, for as long as father lives—or as long as he feels to wish me to give up Martin.” “That will do,” replied her father, with fearful emphasis. “Providence may open up a way for us,” thought Amy, “and if He don't, we must submit.” Neither sage nor Christian could teach better philosophy than Amy's. Seymour bore his trials as he could—he was no philosopher. He no longer met Amy at the accustomed places. She came not to the “Sabbath evening singing-school,” the village lovers' common meeting-ground; “not even,” as Martin despairingly remarked, “when they were preparing the anthem for the cattle-show.” “When, before this,” he said, “was there ever a donation-party at the Reverend Mr. Smith's, and Amy not there?” He “guessed the minister missed the comforter she knit for him, and the little boys their stockings.” “Well, may be she'll go on the Cochin-China mission, after all. Folks think Mr. Blight has intentions—or may be she'll marry Rufus Bradley; he's lost his third, and the street thinks he's looking out again for permanent help—looking towards Amy!” This seemed too intolerable an hypothesis for Martin; after a sigh or two, he turned short about. “No,” he said, “she won't take up with three women's leavings, I know. It's all Uncle Nat. He always was a despot, and now he's kind o' deranged, and what can Amy do?” What poor Amy could do, she did. She tapped at Mrs. Clifford's door in the early morning, and appeared at her bedside pale, and woe-begone. “What now, Amy?” said her mistress, starting from heavy sleep, “has any thing happened at the mill?” “Oh, ma'am,” she replied, “one of the children brought me a note from mother last evening, saying he had left in the morning more so than usual, and had not come home— it was long past supper-time; I surmised, and went straight to the mill. There he was! I have had the dreadfullest night holding him back; I prayed, and begged, and tried to reason with him; but what's the use when folks have no reason to speak to? But I gained something; I staved off harm till daylight, and when people began to stir, he went home, and I come to you for advice, feeling I ought not to leave with our house full of company.” “Never mind my company, Amy—Alice and I can do your work.” It is one of the felicities, as well as humanities of household life in New England, that ladies can perform domestic service when an exigency occurs; nor need the family wait for breakfast, or eat a bad one, because a cook or waiter falls out of line. “You must go back to your father, Amy,” continued Mrs. Clifford, “and stay by him for the present—your mother has no power over him?” “No, ma'am, none—not half so much as Benny.” “Then go, Amy; you will be both firm and gentle with him. Humor him, and tell him—for though Seymour wished that neither you nor your father should know it, yet in this exigency it may do him good—it certainly will you, poor child—tell him, then, that it was Seymour, not I, that was surety for him.” “Was it Martin!” exclaimed Amy, starting from her dejected posture, leaning on her elbow, her eyes downcast and dropping heavy tears; as she turned, her face shone as if sunshine passed over it. “Was it indeed Martin?” she repeated. “Oh, it seems as if that must melt father.” “I believe it will. So go straightway to him, good child, and do not fear or falter.” Goddard's dwelling was a mile from the village. Amy took the shortest way to it, a “cross-lots” path through a birch and maple wood, where there was a full choir of the few birds whose notes last into August. The air was filled with happy insect life. The still leaves were dripping from a shower that had just passed. The breezy clouds were flitting over the sky, alternating with the brilliant gleams of sunshine that penetrated to the stems of the trees with their dark shadows. Amy, not much given to observe or interpret nature, noticed this pretty play of light and shade. “It's the passing clouds make the sunshine seem so bright,” she thought; “and the silence, darkness, and despair of last night make these pleasant sounds so musical, and I guess it's father's awful state makes Martin's nobleness shine clear down to the bottom of my heart. What a difference! Father cares for nothing but gain—gain—gain; and Martin's altogether above it. Insensibly she caught the cheerful spirit of the morning, and she began building a small castle in the air hovering near the mill-stream, and was just settling it on a firm foundation when, coming in sight of her father's homestead, it toppled down. Goddard was sitting on his own door-step, his eye fixed on the ground, the image of sullen melancholy. Benny, his pet boy, was lying on the grass at his feet, playing with a garter snake. “Oh, Amy,” cried the child, as Amy drew the gate-latch, “come and see this cunning little snake—I can't make father look at it.” Goddard, startled by Amy's approach, rose, and feeling the reptile at his foot, crushed the life out of it, muttering, “I hate them—snakes in the grass.” “Oh, father!” cried the child, “how could you?” “I am sorry,” said the father, patting the boy's head, the muscles around his mouth slightly relenting, “I was not thinking when I did it.” “But you should think, sir, before you do things, and then you would not have to be sorry afterwards.” “Benny is right, father,” said Amy, looking steadfastly into her father's eye. “Amy,” said Goddard. “What was father going to say?” asked Amy. Goddard's voice had softened—it resumed its monotone. “No matter, no matter, we both know what we're thinking of; there's no use wasting breath talking.” “Father does not know what I have to tell him—'twill make him feel different.” “No, Amy, nothing will—you've tried, mother has tried, and,” he added, his voice faltering, “Benny has tried.” “Tried what, father?” asked the petted child, who had slipped into his lap, and put his arm around his neck, clinging to him when every one else recoiled from his dreary aspect. “You can't do it, child,” he said, “you can't all do it— it's a cursed load that's crushing me, and I and it must go down together.” “Oh, father don't know all,” cried Amy. “What is it I don't know?” he asked, turning fiercely upon the gentle girl; “are you keeping company with him again; are you married to him?” “Oh, no, sir; did I not promise, father?” “You did, and you never broke your word yet, child.” Goddard drew his hat over his brow, his lips quivered. It seemed a gracious softening, and Amy ventured, with some circumlocution, to communicate the fact of her lover's generosity. Once only he raised his eyes to her, and a gleam of light shot from them, but he settled back into his habitual gloom. “Why father,” said the boy, clearing his way to the only idea he could gather from Amy's communication, “I think Cousin Martin is very good—don't father think he's good, sir?” “No, no, no—did not I tell you I hated snakes in the grass? A thousand dollars surety is he?—hum! I should have owned the mill but for his underhand work, and I should have made five hundred dollars out of it year by year. He has wronged me, he has!” and setting the child down, he walked off toward his potato-field. There he continued till late in the afternoon, hoeing steadily, except when once he came to the bars, beckoned to his boy, took him in his arms, embraced him vehemently, and without speaking, left him. Towards evening he was seen in a neighboring village-shop buying a considerable quantity of gunpowder. An acquaintance seeing he had no fowling-piece with him, asked what he was going to do with it? “What is that to you?” he gruffly replied, and walked out of the shop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. —“Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the roses there to fade so fast?” A change had come over Alice from the hour she had inspected the newspaper over Lisle's shoulder. This change was obvious to all her family, but by none referred to the right moment, or traced to the true cause. She had been so uniformly sparkling with vivacity since Grace's coming, and she was habitually so frank and bright in her outer life, that in respect to the inner, one might have made the child's inference, who said, on looking up at the starry firmament, “if the wrong side is so beautiful, what must the right side be?” But alas! now both inner and outer were often clouded. It became evidently necessary to her to have forethought and predetermination about the little, hourly, gracious hospitalities of home that had been spontaneous, and therefore charming. The roses were fading from her cheek; she was moody and pensive, and fell into reveries, and would sigh, or smile, or blush when startled from them. She would sometimes try to make an excuse for them; but poor Alice was no masker, and as these sighs, from seventeen to twenty, have an accepted interpretation, it was not strange that Mrs. Clifford's family—including “the strangers within her gates” should come to one conclusion. Max, in boy fashion, rallied her in season, and much out of season, his mother thought, when, in the sweet security of happiness 10* long waited for, she smilingly interposed her shield; and Lisle, and he was no self-exaggerating coxcomb, determined to accept his manifest destiny, and not by further procrastination make himself more unworthy of a love next best to that which, to him, was unattainable. As many an ignorant seaman is wrecked by disregarding the magnet, and relying on his own “observation,” so are men by submitting their instincts to what they deem their sober judgment. Lisle had periled the happiness of more than one, when he tore himself away from silent communion with Grace, and invited Alice to go to the lake with him, with a purpose —whose firmness he magnified—of putting the seal and superscription to his fate. He had been as much puzzled as relieved by Alice's recoil. “It could not be caprice,” thus he reasoned, “it was mere girlishness. Well, my affairs will soon be settled, and these useless agitations over forever—come moderation! come tranquillity!” What a level dull prairie of a future was this to the possible paradise that had floated before his younger vision! The old wholesome custom of an early dinner, an hour's advance of the “meridian” of Queen Elizabeth's time, obtained at Mapleton, and that family rite having been duly performed, and a thundergust having passed away, leaving the air fresh and fragrant, Lisle and Alice were awaiting Grace to take a long ramble to a certain “Prospect hill”— (the Puritan proscription of fancy extends even to names) that overlooks a long sweep of the Hudson, and hills, valleys, and lakes, to where the Kaatskills “Shut in the exploring eye.” There was some delay on Grace's part. Alice did not take the hindrance placidly; she put on her mantilla, threw it off, drew her gloves on and drew them off, and finally snatched a skein of silk from her work-basket to wind by way of sedative. Archibald extended his hands to hold it. Alice's eyes met his—“What are you smiling at, Archy?” she asked in all simplicity. “At you, dear Alice. I never shall understand womankind.” “By `womankind,' you mean Grace or me, or perhaps both. But I comprehend you, Archy, and I will tell you what you are like—like a man who has a book in his hand with a puzzling problem which he might solve by turning the leaf, and he stands playing with his thumb and finger, instead of turning it.” This was not the first time that Lisle had recoiled from Alice's frank, direct way of going to the point. It was repulsive to his sensitiveness and reserve; but “no shrinking now,” he thought, and he replied, with a courageous effort, “I would have turned the leaf last evening, Alice, when we were on the lake, but you would not let me.” “Why, Archy, I don't see what you mean, nor what last evening had to do with your problem. I was very wretched. I am sure you know me well enough to know I do not like concealments. You know I love, like the birds, to spread my wings in broad sunshine, you know I do, but—” she hesitated. “This is rather plain speaking,” thought Lisle. He involuntarily looked searchingly at Alice to see if she could mean what her words implied to him, and a blush so evidently painful flushed her face, that he averted his eye, and both were sensibly relieved by the appearance of Amy, who was passing through the room. “Do, Amy,” said Alice, “see what keeps Miss Herbert.” And as Amy, without a word, or the movement of her pale face, obeyed, Alice exclaimed, “Poor Amy! I can not stand seeing her so pale, and petrified; it is a wretched out-of-joint world; but there comes Grace at last; take care, Archy, you are letting the silk slip. There,” she added, tossing it, a hopeless snarl, into her work-box, “it's like every thing else, every thing in life is snarled.” “Why, what is the matter, my child? What has happened?” asked her mother, as she entered from the garden, following Grace. “Oh, enough, Mrs. Clifford,” replied Lisle. “Alice has just been spelling Amy's face, and run her head afoul of the great question of evil.” “And, like most people, under twenty, Miss Alice probably expects to solve it. Stop where you are, my child; do all you can to avoid evil, and lessen misery, and accept and endure what you can not cure; a philosophy I have just been practicing under my plum-trees. Let those theorize about evil that have nothing else to do; it has been a good puzzle for idle brains ever since Adam's time, and is like to last as long as there are men and women—and curculios. But, my dear friends, it is quite time for you to be off; you will be late at home.” “We have been waiting for Grace, mother. It's hard waiting even for you, Grace; truly, `those serve who wait.'” “Those of your restless temper, Alice. While you have been impatient, Miss Herbert has been helping me to fill a basket with our late raspberries.” While Grace went for her hat, Alice asked “why she was not summoned to the raspberry-picking?” Mrs. Clifford well knew why; she was feeling, too, the weary task of waiting, and she would not interrupt any opportunity that seemed to indicate its end. She did not notice Alice's question, but said, “The raspberries are for old Mrs. Denham—just leave them, in your way, Alice, and take this lovely bouquet which Grace has tied up for me, to the sick girl at Smith's.” “Ah, mother, you find Grace is not quite the superfluous fine lady you took her for one little month ago.” “No, indeed, Alice,” said Mrs. Clifford, who had not only righted a wrong judgment but had enough candor (the rarest of the virtues) to confess it. “I knew that temperament and training were against Grace, and I did not believe that she was strong enough to master them. I have not the prevailing habit of deferring to my juniors, but in regard to Grace, your instincts, Alice, were truer than my judgment.” “Dear, generous Mrs. Clifford,” thought Lisle, “it is plain that you are as ignorant as the rest of the world of Miss Herbert's engagement; if you were not, such praise would be keen irony to one who, instead of `mastering,' has weakly yielded to the worst and weakest of temptations.” Grace came from her room equipped for the walk. “Now, dear mother,” said Alice, “your last directions.” “After you have dropped the bouquet, and the raspberries, you may leave the last Edinburgh at Crofts'. Poor fellow! he is on his crutches yet. Time was, Archy, when it would have gone hard to send off a fresh Edinburgh, but now—” “Oh, mother,” interrupted Alice, “is there any other errand?” “Nothing, but just to step round (“mother's `step round,'” whispered Alice to Archy, “is a half mile's circuit'),' to Goddard's, and see if all is going right there. Poor Amy is so troubled; and stay, don't you want to take the `Heart of Mid Lothian' to Mrs. Goddard; she says `nothing appeases' her like one of `Mister Scott's novels.' And when you are there, tell Goddard, or leave word for him, that he may have the calf.” “Mother! Clover's calf?—your Ayrshire?” “Yes, he fancied it, and it may divert his mind.” “No doubt any thing he can convert into five dollars will divert Goddard's mind. Is there any thing else?” added Alice, springing from the door-step, and looking back smilingly at her mother. “Yes, one thing, Archy; be kind enough to drop in and tell the Clarkes we expect them to tea. Ask them to bring the children—they'll amuse poor Daisy. And, oh, just one thing more; take up the little whip I bought for Benny.” It was thus, by diffusing her thoughtful benefactions noiseless, and nurturing as the dews, that Mrs. Clifford had become the general providence of Mapleton. There were no “poor” there in the technical sense, but wherever humanity is, there is its lot—wounds, into which the healing balsam of sympathy may be dropped, and diseases of mind and body that thoughtful wisdom may alleviate. There had been sorrowful passages in Mrs. Clifford's life; griefs that have few parallels; but no egotistic murmur, or useless wail escaped her. They were indicated only by her quick susceptibility to the sorrows of others; if these did not admit relief she shut her eyes to them, and genially partook the happiness of the happy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. —“And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love, so rich within his soul, And tender me, forsooth, affection?” Our friends were proceeding on their walk through the village street, embowered with sugar-maples and far-stretching elms, and sweet with the thousand flowers that were exhaling heavenward in delicious incense the showers that had poured on them at mid-day when they were met, and all romantic associations were rudely broken by a distinguished person, who, with a full stop facing them, glanced his eye from Alice to her companions, plainly indicating a duty for her to do. Alice comprehended, and introduced him as “Major Hart.” The Major was, in no way, a man to be dodged; he was full six feet two inches in height, and with shoulders as broad as a porter's, and strength of limb in proportion. His face was round as the full moon, and as jolly as that to the reveler's eye; his hair was jet black, abundant, and curling, and his whiskers, and elaborately-tended moustache of the same character; in short, as our reader must perceive, if our delineation does him justice, he bore a pleasing resemblance to the blocks exhibited in barbers' shops, the beau ideals of the gentry of the razor and brush. After expressing his regret that he had been absent during Mr. Lisle's visit to Mapleton, and his fear that it had been very dull for him, he patronizingly added, “If you are not going too far, Miss Alice, I will accompany you.” “Oh, Major Hart, we are going too far—I—I mean, we are going very far—down to Prophet Crofts', and round by Goddard's, through the glen, and up to Prospect hill.” “Bless me! through the glen—why it's like penetrating a chaparral. I don't shrink from the walk; after my Mexican life, you know, it's a mere skirmish; but I have an engagement with a client at seven, and it's now four o'clock.” The Major stood deliberating, with his ponderous watch in his hand, and chain and seals depending thereto that must have drawn heavily on a Californian remittance of gold. Unfortunately the good nature of our people does not allow them to profit by the short process of snubbing, so thoroughly understood in the fatherland; and Alice said, in a tone of subdued impatience, “It is not possible for us to get home by seven, Major Hart; not before eight or nine, perhaps ten.” “Ah well, we professional gentlemen must make sacrifices to the fair sex, Mr. Lisle,” replied the major, not doubting he was bestowing a boon in inflicting his tediousness. “You are of the profession, Mr. Lisle?” Lisle bowed. “Yes, so I thought; I have seen your name in the law-reports in the Daily Times—capital reports they are—and in the Boston Law Reporter, quite a compliment to a tyro in our profession, Mr. Lisle.” Lisle bowed again—not at all as if his head were turned by the “compliment;” and Alice whispered to Grace, “The fly in the ointment; how shall we get rid of him?” Chance came to their aid. The daily coach passed, with a single passenger, a lady with a fearful amount of baggage, huge trunks, portmanteaus, and boxes. The coach was passing rapidly with the impetus it usually receives on approaching a country inn. The lady put out her head, bowed, and waved her hand. “Was that bow to you or to me, Mr. Lisle?” asked the Major. “Indeed,” replied Lisle, hemming, stammering, and biting his lips, “I do not know for which of us the honor was intended.” “Well, what do you say, ladies? Ladies, as we of the profession know, Mr. Lisle, are the best witnesses.” The ladies' veils were down. They had not observed the stranger, nor seen the salutation. “Such a polite and pleasant bow as that,” resumed the Major, “should not pass like a `wild goose's feather, unclaimed of any man,'” and chuckling at what he considered his brilliantly apt quotation, he added, “I conclude, on reflection, that must be a lady I met at the President's levee in Washington, two years ago. I wonder what she can have come to Mapleton for?” The Major's further “reflection” had brought him to some other conclusions, and to a rather satisfactory solution of his wonder; and after walking a few paces further, he said he “was sorry to excuse himself—it was a pity the ladies should not have a beau a piece—but, on second thought, he felt it would be wrong to disappoint his client;” and so he took his leave. “Then you have bores, dear Alice,” said Grace, “even in these purlieus of Paradise?” “Yes, Grace, indigenous bores. But who can this blessed lady be who wrought our deliverance?” Archibald went manfully up to the stake, and replied, “A very particular friend of mine, Alice, and an acquaintance of your's, Miss Herbert—Miss Adeline Clapp.” “Your hobgoblin, Archy, as you called her in a letter to my mother.” “Poor Mr. Lisle,” said Grace; “there's nothing for you but to drown yourself in Lily pond!” “Oh! she would bring me to life again; `water won't drown, fire won't burn;' no elemental power can save me from her omnipresent clutch—there's no way of escape. Don't speak of her again—don't allude to her; the thought of her tears my nerves.” There was a real tragedy on Lisle's countenance, which seemed very comical to his companions, but they forbore, except by the exchange of merry glances, any further allusion to the subject, and he forgot its annoyance. The present was to him one of those rare and downy passages in human life that are perfectly satisfactory. No thought wandered back to the past—no restless dread pointed to the future. They were soon in the lovely woodland paths beyond the village, Alice having left them, here and there, to do her mother's errands, saying, as she did so, “Go on, I will overtake you,” or, “I will join you at the top, or the bottom of the hill,” as the case might be. Poor Archibald—these short passages alone with Grace, the last perhaps he might enjoy unfettered, seemed to him, like some moments between waking and sleeping, to comprise a life-time of thought and feeling. “Now one more detour and I have done,” said Alice; “give me the book and the whip, Archy, and I will meet you at the foot-bridge, below the dam—you remember it?” “Remember it! Did Alice ever tell you, Miss Herbert, how she tumbled off that bridge when she was a little thing —not quite so tall as she is now?” “Yes, she told me, long ago—at school, you know, Alice —and how you fastened your arms round Mr. Lisle's neck, and came near to drowning him; and do you remember what else you told me about it?” added Grace, with a significant smile. “Oh yes, indeed, some foolery about my being in love with Archy, as silly girls will be, ever so young. But now we have come to something more substantial, a grown-up friendship—have not we, Archy?” and she playfully kissed her hand to him, as she ran off towards the Goddards. “How subtle is self-love!” There was something grating to Lisle in Alice's perfect self-possession. He had certainly nothing warmer than friendship to offer her; but he expected something more. Men, the least selfish men, expect more than they give. “It's very thoughtful of your Mar,” said Goddard's wife. “Benny will enjoy the whip; but my plate's upside down. I always told him he was too worldly-minded—toiling and toiling o' days, and reckoning up o' nights. Says I, `Goddard, it's the blessing of the Lord,' says I, `that maketh rich;' but he did not think much of that kind of riches, and went on, and on, till it's come to where it has—I ain't superstitious, but it looks dark. He has not tasted victuals to-day; he has not come in from the potato field. He'll hoe, say half an hour, and then stand stock-still as a scarce-crow, leaning on his hoe. He even sent Benny away from him; poor Benny, he's like a weaning child—fret, fret.” “But, Mrs. Goddard,” said Alice, cheerily, “you must not fret, fret, too. Put away your sewing, and try and divert your mind with this book my mother has sent you— the `Heart of Mid Lothian;' perhaps you have not read it?” “La! Miss Alice, I have read it twice over; but that's nothing. I always say Mister Scott's writings are like light —you can't have too much of them. I am ready enough to put aside my sewing; I feel sewing is aggravating. Thank your Mar—she knows what will lift a body right out of the mire.” Alice understood her people well enough to receive this as a burst of enthusiasm from a Yankee woman, and she left Dame Goddard, blessing Sir Walter in her inmost heart for the charm that charms wisely, surely, and universally. Alice rejoined her friends at the foot-bridge. They expressed no uneasiness at her delay. As they were passing over the bridge, Lisle paused midway to point out the precise spot in the narrow, but deep stream where Alice fell in. The sight of the place recalled forgotten incidents. He related them circumstantially, and turning to appeal to Alice, he saw that she was leaning on the railing, apparently not listening. She started, and turned suddenly. There were tears in her eyes. A shadow came over Archibald's face, and his voice changed from its animated tone to one of tender sympathy. He took her hand affectionately; “dear Alice,” he said, “forgive me. I was not thinking of Arthur —you were.” Alice's tears reminded him of the passionate tenderness with which Arthur, when they met him on their way home, had taken his little drenched and half-drowned sister into his arms. Alice was the truest of human beings. Nothing like evasion, or subterfuge, or false show of any sort was tolerable to her. She could not take the credit to her sisterly feeling which Archibald had given to it, and with a tremulous voice and averted eye, she said, “I was not thinking of Arthur. Please,” she added, hurriedly, “don't ask me what I was thinking of.” Lisle did not ask, he only guessed—to blush before the walk was over, for the unwonted conceit of that guess. “You are a little taller than you were then, Alice,” said Grace, smiling, “but not a whit less a child.” And Grace sighed as she made the same inference that Archibald had; both were at fault. To what volumes of feeling may a smile or a sigh be a key! Alice was startled: “Have I,” she thought, “betrayed any thing to Grace's keen eye?” But as she met that eye, there was no “speculation” in it— Grace was reading the painful secrets of her own heart. They proceeded, winding along the beaten path that followed the mill-stream, and passing through the romantic “glen,” a deep ravine sunken between hills (by courtesy, mountains), where their wild path winded around or surrounded huge rocks covered with mosses, lichens, and fern; and then ascending, through dense woodland, and along the rocky edge of a precipice overhanging harvest-fields, they came out on “Prospect hill,” the smooth summit of the landscape. There they sat down, and forgot the time, as young people will forget it and throw off its trammels, who are bound together by a strong and developing interest. They were tired, and rest was sweet. They looked down on a scene characteristic of New England, and though familiar in our hill-country, it has always a fresh and soothing charm, from its repose and affluence of rural prosperity and contentments. There were white villages, with their ever-attendant academies, and church spires pointing heavenward from hill-top and valley; orchards with their reddening fruit, and pasture-fields with their herds; brooks gleaming, like silvery paths, along rich green meadows; lakes looking out, like sweet, blue eyes, from beneath the brows of overhanging hills, and the Hudson, which in the far distance looked like a ray of light playing around the base of the Kaatskills. There they lingered to see the sun set, and to see the moon rise. The scene was new to Grace, and the finest chords of her being responded to it, like an instrument to the touch of a master. The spirits of both Grace and Archibald were so raised above their ordinary level, that material things were glorified mediums to them; poetry alone seemed a fit response to the outward influence. Grace would recite a favorite passage from a favorite poet; Lisle responded with another—the smallest phrase she uttered had its “prosperity in his ear,” an undefinable charm. Poor little Alice was restless. She wandered off and plucked wild flowers, and returned to deck Grace's hair with them; if she spoke, it was of some fact or circumstance that seemed to Lisle not in harmony with the present scene of enchantment. She withdrew and sat apart. Suddenly it occurred to Lisle that she had felt the embarrassment of being a third party, and he started to his feet with a compunctious pang. “Ah, you do hear the nine o'clock bell, Archy,” called out Alice, in a tone not the least querulous, but whose playfulness might indicate that he had appeared quite beyond sublunary sounds; “it is quite time we were on our way home,” she said; “but, before we go, please, Archy, run down into that hard-hack field and get me a bunch of fringed gentians—they grow like weeds there—I promised dear little Daisy to bring her some.” These were words of small import, but they produced a sudden revolution in Lisle's mind; they awoke him from a delicious dream, and broke like a knell a spell of enchantment. He went to do Alice's bidding, and in that short walk he felt the unmanliness of suspended resolution, and deferred duty; and resolved, at the very first opportunity, to pledge his loyalty, and give into the hands of another the reins he felt too weak to hold. Alas! duty is a bungler at heart's work! The flowers were plucked, and they set out on their return. Varying their route, in order to shorten it, they entered a long strip of woodland, by a footpath, in which Alice, who was familiar with it, led the way. Grace halted at a quagmire, over which Alice had leaped dry-shod. “Oh, Alice, I can't do that feat,” said Grace, with a dismay, half tragic, half comic. “No, do not attempt it,” cried Archibald, with the eager deference a man instinctively pays to graceful impotence in a beautiful woman. “Is there any way of getting round this?” he called to Alice, who was going on, quite unconscious she had achieved any thing difficult to be done. “Round! No, Archy, of course the path lies in the only place where it is easy to pass it; but you come over, Archy. Here, just by, is a pile of cut wood, and we can soon make a bridge for Grace to pass over this great gulf!” Before he was at her side, she had thrown down a bit of wood, saying, playfully, “There be some sports are painful, but their labor Delight in them sets off.” Lisle took up the quotation, and throwing down billet after billet, said, “Some kinds of business Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters Point to rich ends.” “Thanks!—enough,” cried Grace. “Now, you, Ferdinand, come on this side, and take one of my hands, and you, Miranda, the other, and so I shall make this perilous passage, and `love's labor' shall not be lost.” Perhaps Archibald was disconcerted by Grace placing them so distinctly, by her allusion to their quotation from Ferdinand, in the relation of lovers, or it might be the grasp of Grace's hand; he blundered, his foot slipped. Grace instinctively pulled away her hand, the bit of wood on which she stood so turned, that one of her feet was submerged. Archibald, adroitly, and with confused apologies, lifted her to the dry ground, and both he and Alice stooped to wipe the mud from her boot; Alice exclaiming, “French boots! and an absurdly little foot, Grace, for a country scramble,” and Archibald admiring, as men will, without any reference to its capabilities, the small beautiful foot “bien chaussé.” Grace was glad of time to recover from what she fancied was a slight sprain of her ankle, which she was eager to conceal, that it might not hinder their walk. She struggled on, sitting down as often as a fallen tree, or moss-covered stone afforded her a pretext. “This is very pleasant,” said Alice, “but we must go on; it's nearly ten, and my mother will be anxious.” Grace was obliged to confess the cause of her lingering. Archibald at once proposed to go to the village for a conveyance. “The road could not be far from them, and while he was gone, Miss Herbert might manage, with Alice's assistance, to reach it; or, still better, he would bring a man from the village to assist in bearing her to the carriage.” Alice opposed this. “It was at least two miles to the village by the road.” “She knew a much shorter cross-cut—Archy could not find it.” Archy proposed attending her. “Poor Archy,” said Alice, “it is a harder problem than the ferriage of the goose, the corn, and the fox. But come, we will compromise—compromises cut all the gordian knots now-a-days. You shall come with me, Archy, to the end of the wood, and then return to Grace, while I go to the village.” This was agreed on, Grace protesting herself particularly pleased with the novelty of her position. Archibald and Alice traversed the wood in silence, and in a much shorter time than they expected, for they seemed not to have gone far beyond Grace's hearing, when they reached the end of it, where the trees appeared as if they had filed off on each side to encircle a natural vestibule or entrance. They were startled by the beauty of the place, and paused for a moment, in a flood of moonlight, to look at the quivering shadows, and the stems of the white birches glistening in the light. Alice was the first to move. When she reached the fence, where it was so broken that the topmost rail was but a step from the ground, she put her foot on it, and turning, said, “Now is your time, Archy,” with such simplicity, that it was strange he could misunderstand her. But Lisle was befogged, and he did misunderstand her; and retaining the hand he had taken to aid her, he said, “Come back—stop one moment—let it be my time. I will `turn the leaf' now, and you must solve `my problem' for me. Alice, do you?—I mean, can you—that is, will you love me?” “Why, Archy!—why, what do you mean? Why, certainly, you know I do, and can, and always have loved you.” “Alice, you surely understand me. You know what I mean; what I am offering; what I am asking.” “I—I—I am not sure I do,” she replied, half frightened, and half laughing. “You seem to be moon-struck, Archy.” “I never,” he replied, with a deadly serious smile, “was more rational. It shall be the study of my life to make you happy, and better to deserve the boon I ask.” “But, Archy, you are not in earnest?” “Indeed, I am.” “Why, Archy, it seems to me so absurd, so strange—a dream! It never occurred to me that you had a thought of me. Why, no, dear Archy, I am very fond of you, but I don't love you in the least—in that way I mean—I never did, and I never can.” They both stood silent for a moment, surely a moment of sharper suffering to Lisle than was his desert. Alice's arms hung down, and her hands were tightly clasped. Suddenly, with that inspiration of which the finer sense of woman is capable, she touched the truth. Archibald saw the blood flow back in flood-tide to her blanched cheeks; her glance pierced his soul. “My dear Archy,” she said, “you have wronged me and wronged yourself—why, I can not tell, I can not guess. Men tell true love without speaking, never with such faltering, freezing speech as yours—hesitating—weighing your words— urged on by some delusion, and held back by your own upright soul! Oh, I am so sorry, Archy!” Turning away, she sprang like a fawn over the fence, and disappeared from his sight. She hurried on, feeling much like one who should VOL. II. 11 see the sun rise from the west, or any other imaginable contravention of the laws of nature. She hastened forward through bush, through brake, across fields and fences, till she came to the foot-path along the outlet of Lily Pond. By this time clouds had gathered and obscured the moon. Alice had no fears; her mind was preoccupied, and she was familiar with the way. She saw the light glimmering from the village, and the risks from an irresponsible foreign population were yet unknown in Mapleton. She was not therefore in the least startled by dimly descrying the figure of a man a few paces ahead of her. He paused for a moment. She thought he observed her, for after springing over a fence into an orchard that was parallel to her path, and a small distance from it, he crouched down; Alice stopped; he rose again, and proceeded so rapidly that she lost sight of him. His stealthy movement excited her curiosity. Suddenly it flashed upon her that the man must be Goddard going again to the mill to carry out his insane purpose. She forgot herself, forgot Grace, and thinking only of averting the wretchedness impending over poor Amy and her people, she hastened on. Her way now ran along a bank on a level with the mill dam and above the road. She saw the man scramble down the bank, cross the road, and enter the mill. When she reached the end of the bank, she paused, recoiling from encounterig a wretch wrought up to desperate deeds. While she hesitated, a candle was lighted within the mill, and through a window, opposite to her, she clearly saw Goddard walking up and down, and violently gesticulating. “He is certainly about to do some horrible thing,” thought Alice; “burn the mill!—perhaps burn himself in it —poor Amy!” She then saw him take a parcel from his pocket, and pour its contents on the floor. “Merciful God help me!” she exclaimed, and brave in the faith of her instinctive prayer, she slid down the bank, crossed the road, and entered the mill by an outside stairway, that led up to the mill-loft. Goddard stood in the middle of the floor with a candle in his hand, and a pile of gunpowder at his feet. Alice seized the candle and held it at arm's length. Goddard recoiled, awed, and overpowered. It must have been a strange sight, this brawny man with his frenzied eye and coarse, distorted features, recoiling before a slight girl, who, for the moment, was a heavenly presence, a resistless force like that the painter has given to the light figure of the angel Michael in his triumph over the man of sin. But it was but a minute's pause, and Goddard rallied. “Who the devil sent you here?” he said. “God sent me,” she answered; “God sent me to save you, Goddard!” “No, no,” he said, recognizing her, “Amy sent you. Save me!—you can't do it, nor Amy, nor all the powers above!” “Oh, don't talk that way, Goddard—think of your family!” “Think of them! I have thought—I have done nothing but think—what's the use? We should all be beggars together. Hark! there comes a wagon! Clear out—I'll not be stopped again! Don't you see the gunpowder? Clear out, you little fool, or by Him that made us, you'll share and share with me!” “I'll not leave you, Goddard—you dare not murder me. Oh, come away, go home to little Benny.” Goddard's heart-strings still vibrated to that name. His head dropped; “poor little boy!” he murmured. “Oh, you will go home to him? he will be so glad.” “No, no—there you're out!” he cried, his fierceness returning; “no, he left me to-day howling—I could not coax him back—he's dropped off too! I am alone in this cursed, black world—disappointed—ruined; they all watch me— they all hate me—my woman, Amy, Benny—and I hate him more than they all hate me—she may marry him now, there'll be none to hinder. They're coming—away with you!” He snatched at the candle; Alice shut her hand over it, and as she felt the darkness close around them, she shrieked for help. Goddard laughed; his laugh sounded like the bellowing of a brute. “You can't stop me!” he said, and thrusting his hand into his pocket, he pulled out a package of matches, and lighting a single bunch, and throwing it into a pile of rags and old cotton garments that were stowed under the roof, “We'll soon have light enough!” he cried, and while he said it, the fire took, and the flames streamed upward to the roof. No human power could now save the determined man. A flood of terror came over Alice; she sprang to the door and opened it. How she descended the flight of stairs, she knew not; nor in what direction she went. Her instincts alone were left to her, and she obeyed them. She could only afterward recall her increasing terror as the light from the mill increased, and the horrible shock of its explosion, when she fainted and fell by the road-side. Her next perception, and it seemed to her like the strange vicissitude of a dream, was of being slowly driven in an open vehicle by a man who supported her head on his breast, whose arm sustained her, and whose warm large hand gently inclosed her little cold one. It still seemed a dream. She was yet but half conscious, and made no motion till she felt lips on her cheek and heard a low whisper of “my beloved Alice!” Her senses returned at once and perfectly; she lifted up her head, looked in her friend's face, and with a joyous sense of escape, and a far more joyous sense of the dawn of infinite happiness, she clasped her arms around his neck, and dropping her blushing face on his bosom, cried “It is you! thank God!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. “Les cartes ont toujours raison.” In the open-door life of Mapleton it was soon known that Alice Clifford was at the mill on the evening of the explosion. Consequently half the street (as Seymour would have worded it) poured into Mrs. Clifford's the next morning to get an explanation of what (as Seymour said again) “the street thought mysterious.” Some came by right of intimacy, and some who substitute social cravings for social rights. Of the latter class, was Miss Clapp, who was attended by Major Donalphonso Hart. She inquired for Miss Herbert, and on being told that she was with her friend, who was too much indisposed to see company, Miss Clapp asked for Mr. Lisle. He had gone off trout-fishing with young Mr. Clifford. “Well, I guess,” said Miss Adeline turning to her escort, “we'll go in, and see the old lady; 'twill seem friendly.” The Major bowed acquiescence, saying, “That just meets my feelings, Miss Adeline. I don't approve of ceremony.” Neither did Mrs. Clifford, except as a necessary wall to defend her castle from just such intrusions as she was now compelled to endure. She was never in a more unfit humor to receive unwelcome visitors. She had been a good deal shaken by her child's appalling risks. She had sent poor Amy off to her mother, and of course had an accumulation of household affairs to dispose of, and to tell the truth, gracious and humane as she was, she had a general shrinking from new people, and a particular antipathy to the genus Clapp, so that Miss Adeline's reception was rather chill. “I can't wonder, ma'am,” she said immediately upon her introduction, “you appear solemnized; sudden events are solemn, as I observed to the Major when we heard the explosion. We were sitting, the Major and me, talking over Washington, and saying what an interesting place it is, so many intelligent members, and such affable foreign ambassadors, and then we went off to speaking of Mrs. Tallis; at least I was telling the Major—he had never heard of her before—how they had located in a lovely spot not far from Grace's sister Esterly, and were after all—you know, ma'am, probably what I allude to?” “I have heard Mrs. Tallis' name,” replied Mrs. Clifford, shrinking from Miss Clapp's unshrinking style of dilation. “Well, how uncommon, that Grace has not told you about her, but I suppose she has feelings in that direction. Well, I was just remarking that the Tallises after all were living like two doves—as married couples ought to live—(her eye appealing to the Major) when bang went the mill. `Mercy,' says I. `Major, was that a thunder-clap?' `Oh, no,' says he, `no Clapp ever produced so unpleasant a sensation.' A pretty compliment, wasn't it ma'am?—so quick and original.” Mrs. Clifford was relieved from the necessity of replying, by the entrance of her son Max, who, in his frank, cordial manner, shook hands with the Major, and on his presenting him to “Miss Adeline,” said, “Miss Clapp is not the stranger to me, that I am to her. I have frequently heard her spoken of.” The good-natured creature detected no sinister meaning in the mischievous curl of Max's lip. She nodded graciously to him, and when he went on to say, “I suppose we owe the honor of Miss Clapp's visit to Mapleton to her friend, Mr. Lisle,” she actually blushed. This phenomenon was followed by another. The Major was disconcerted, and a-hemed, and “hoped Miss Clapp would not owe all her pleasure in Mapleton to Mr. Lisle?” “Oh, no, Major,” rejoined Max, “you know the military candidate always carries the day in our elections, and who shall dare contend with him, who can wield both `pen and sword.'” And thrumming on the open piano, he hummed, “I'll make thee famous by my pen, And glorious by my sword.” Miss Adeline's white teeth radiated through her smiling lips. “By the way, Major,” resumed Max, “has any one apologized to you for Mr. Lisle's spontaneous appropriation of your carriage, last evening?” The Major said, “It needed no apology; whatever he had was at the service of the ladies; it was all just right.” “Precisely,” Max said. “Never did horses appear more opportunely. Poor Miss Herbert had sprained her ankle coming down Prospect Hill—she has a touch of the heroic, and she dragged along, upheld by Archy, to the road-side, where they were met by your man passing with your sublime ponies. So Lisle took possession, and drove Miss Herbert home. The girls are pretty well done for with the walk, and the upshot at the mill. Mother,” he added, “I am sure you are impatient to go to them?” She was as impatient as a bird caught by a rash school-boy. “Miss Clapp will excuse you. She does not stand on ceremony.” “Would to heaven, she did,” thought Mrs. Clifford; but Miss Clapp was not to be headed. “No, to be sure,” she said. “I make no account of ceremony, and I will excuse your ma with pleasure, after I have spoken a few words in private to her. Gentlemen, you can go out, and walk round. I shall soon make an end, Major.” There was no escape; the enemy had possession of the citadel. The gentlemen retreated, and Mrs. Clifford submitted. To do Miss Clapp justice, she was slightly abashed. Our gracious Mrs. Clifford could be, on occasion, as stately as Minerva. But Miss Adeline felt that it was an opportunity not to be lost, and after a small hesitation, and a few preliminaries, such as may be imagined from Miss Adeline's indigenous style of conversation, she repeated to Mrs. Clifford the “views” and “claims” reported in a former part of her history. Mrs. Clifford manifested her impatience by parenthetical interruptions, ringing the bell to give various domestic directions, calling out to Max to drive the hens from Alice's “flower-beds,” etc., etc. Adeline Clapp was as persistent as an east wind, but there was an end, and she concluded with “now, ma'am what do you advise?” “Nothing, madam. I do not see why you have selected me as your confidential counselor. My only possible advice to you would be to forget this childish idea as soon as possible, and give over the disgusting persecution.” “Well, now ma'am, I can't conceive why you should be so roiled. I thought of speaking to you, because Mr. Lisle is, as it were, a son to you, and I have always heard you spoken of, ma'am, as a worthy old lady, and I, being an orphan, I thought you would take an interest. I ain't touchy, and I don't feel affronted, but I must say you don't use quite the right words when you mention `childish ideas,' and `persecution.' I know gentlemen—attorneys at law, too—who would not hold it `persecution' to have ?200,000 thrown into their hands without conditions—for where I give my heart, ma'am, there I give my fortune.” Miss Clapp felt that she had taken a proud stand-point, and she went on. “I have been constant, and I have had more than one striking temptation to be otherwise.” She cast a glance out the window at the Major's stalwart figure, and added, “I may have still more, but, as my lawyer says, says he, `It is not an open question, Miss Clapp; or rather,' says he, `I had ought to say, Mrs. Lisle; for,' says he, `you are the lawful wife of Archibald Lisle, Esquire.'” The party thus named, was, at this moment, coming from the entry through the open parlor door, and heard distinctly (for Miss Adeline had not “that excellent thing in woman,” a low voice) the last clause of her sentence. “I will leave Mr. Lisle to adjust his own legal affairs,” said Mrs. Clifford, curtly, and she withdrew, leaving Adeline Clapp, plaintiff, literally versus Archibald Lisle, defendant. Miss Adeline, for the first time in her life, shrank from her position. Her all-sufficiency quailed. She rose from the sofa, put down her veil, put it up again, and fidgeted with her gloves, till Mr. Lisle said, with perfect composure, “Miss Adeline, will you be so good as to explain what you have just said? Perhaps I did not hear aright. You are too kind to jest on so serious a subject, and I am sure too just to impute to me an aspiration to the honor of imparting my name to you.” Archibald's tone was serious. Miss Clapp was perplexed, for though she was too obtuse to penetrate the thinnest veil of irony, she could not quite understand the smiles in Archibald's eyes, and certain movements of the muscles of his face that were apparent, though he covered his mouth with his handkerchief. But whatever was the character of his emotion, he was firm, and determined, now that the “hobgoblin” had assumed a tangible form, to clutch it. “Really, Miss Adeline,” he said, “you must explain. I must be absolved from pretensions that, in my wildest fancies, I never conceived. Speak out, Miss Adeline, it is not your 11* style to speak in riddles.” Lisle threw down his hat, folded his arms, and stood with an air of such absolute tranquillity, that Miss Clapp took heart of grace, and believed all was coming out right. “Well, I am sure, Archy, I don't like riddles. I am always in favor of plain speaking—the Clapps all are. We mean to deal honorable, and above-board, and if I have kept dark, and seemed mysterious, it has been owing to peculiar circumstances. You know the fair sex are expected to have their lips buttoned up upon some subjects—to be retiring, as it were—and I have always felt as if it would appear prettier if you were the first to put in the claim.” “Claim,” interrupted Lisle. “For heaven's sake, Miss Adeline, tell me what you mean by `claim,' and `peculiar circumstances?'” Fortunately for Lisle, for his heroic coolness was giving way, the Major tapped at the door, and without waiting for an answer, opened it, and perceiving, as he afterward elegantly expressed it, “that his finger was not wanted in that pie,” he bowed and retreated. “All I ask, Miss Adeline,” said Lisle, resuming his good-natured tone, “is that you should unmistify our relations as briefly as possible, and relieve the Major as well as myself; for I perceive that he fears, as he might professionally express it, that I am taking `the shot out of his gun.'” “Well now, Archibald Lisle,” she replied, “that sounds like old times, familiar and pleasant. Now sit down, friendly. I wish you had a stick to whittle—it would relieve your embarrassment.” Lisle assured her that he was not in the slightest degree “embarrassed,” and the intrepid woman proceeded, after a slight preface of wonder that he had not “understood her hints last winter in New York,” when she confessed she had “all but spoken out,” to detail minutely the grounds on which she placed the legality and inviolability of a marriage-contract with Lisle. She did not falter, or look down, or look aside from beginning to end. Lisle listened without interruption, as he would have listened to the case of a client. She proceeded to state the startling amount of her fortune, and the productive mode of its investment. Still he was silent. She expressed her thorough disapprobation of the “Women's Rights” movement, and her cheerful acquiescence in his unshackled control of “principal and interest.” And then as she paused, he spoke, and not in an exultant tone, for Lisle's chivalry toward woman in the abstract extended to woman in the concrete. “Your generosity is prodigious, Miss Adeline,” he said, “but I assure you, you are completely unfettered, and I have no more right than hope in the case—no lien whatever on your bonds and mortgages, and factory stock. Your `at the very least ?250,000' —she had thus specified the gross amount—are destined to more fortunate hands than mine. The castle in the air, you have so kindly built for me, must dissolve before one small fact. I was not of age, my dear Miss Adeline, on the memorable night of that mock-wedding, and I a little wonder your brother `Dates' should have forgotten that as I was leaving Cambridge, his hospitality anticipated by two days the date of my majority. And even if the stringent administration of the law in Massachusetts held you bound, in spite of my minority, the fact that Judge Eastly had retired from the magistracy prior to the `broomstick' marriage would prevent it being binding—in all events I should doubt the security of my happiness, as it would still depend on the precedents alleged in my behalf by your legal adviser being substantiated by a legal tribunal. So I congratulate you, my dear Miss Clapp, on your escape from these fancied fetters, and trust that love is forging others, for you more fitting!” “Archy! Archy!” called out Max from the lawn. Lisle obeyed the summons, and sprang to the door like a released prisoner. One should be familiar with certain temperaments to understand the exact state of Miss Adeline Clapp's feelings at this juncture. Like the child with his magic lanthorn, there was one sigh for the picture that had passed, and a bright look-out for the next to come. Not one pang of the “woman scorned,” for, as she afterwards expressed herself in a letter to “Dates,” Archy was fair, and above-board, and very polite too! “Every one was liable to mistakes. Lisle was something uncommon, but then there were good fish in the sea yet. Major Donalphonso Hart was taller than Lisle, and of a handsome build, and if he were not a New York lawyer, he stood high at the bar in his own county; and she had often seen his name in the papers during the Mexican war; and after all,” she concluded, “he seems more like one of our sort of folks than Archy did!” Miss Adeline's was homeopathic practice; her philosophy was adapted to her case. “Similia similibus!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. “What think'st thou then of me, and this my state; Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed of happiness or not?” When Grace went to her room after the eventful walk to Prospect Hill, she found a letter from her sister on her table. Eleanor wrote as follows: “My Dear Grace:— “Uncle Walter came home yesterday; for home, my house is to be to him henceforth, unless you steal him from me. The children were in transports at seeing him. `You shall never go away from us again!' cried May, sitting on one of his knees, while Nel stuck, like a burr, to the other. `I never will, May,' he replied, `if your mother can find a place in her little box for me; be it in attic or closet.' `A place for you, Uncle Walter, I guess she can—and if mother can't, I can; you can double up and sleep with me in my trundle-bed!' Nel put in her claim, `You can double up double, Uncle Watty,' she said, `and sleep in my tib.' Uncle Walter laughed; Nel brushed a tear from his cheek, saying, `How funny you are, Uncle Watty! to laugh and cry too!' `I have a room ready for dear Uncle Walter, girls!' I said, whereupon May shouted, `Oh, I know, mother, I know it's for Uncle Walter you have been fixing the dining-room; you might have told me, mother, when I asked you what you got the new paper and paint for; and the new bedstead and book-case, and easy chair, and every thing. It was not fair, mother, not to tell me!' `I only waited, May, till Uncle Walter consented to the arrangement—let him come and see if he can manage in our narrow quarters.' Uncle Walter, the girls at his heels, followed me. I confess, that as I opened the door, I thought the room looked pleasant with its pretty new carpet, fresh chintz curtains and covers, and the little decorations with which I had endeavored to set off the few comforts I had been able to stow in a space fifteen by twelve. After looking round with the sweetest satisfaction, Uncle Walter seized a vase of fresh flowers, and on pretence of smelling them, with childlike guile, hid his tears; he need not. The soft emotions become his robust, manly face. I remember your once telling him that his ever-ready smiles and tears denoted his latent youth, and became him, as blossoms do a rugged old tree. His countenance changed, `But Eleanor,' he said, `this was your dining-room?' `It was, Uncle Walter, and I am getting, in the place of a mere convenience, a living, loving soul.' `I accept it, my child,' he said, `as freely as you give it, and we won't quarrel as to which has the best of the bargain, the giver or the receiver. My spirit will have rest with you, and in this “fifteen by twelve,” space for its freest breath. It has been starved, pinched, and chilled long enough in those big Bond-street rooms, where downy beds did not rest me, nor cushioned chairs give me ease. I hated the place from the moment Grace left the house; and to return to it—pah! it would be the wilderness without the manna!' “He has just gone to his room for the night, after talking much of you, and more of himself than I have heard him in his whole life before; and think of it, dear Grace, he has explained the mystery of the letter we found in the green trunk! Poor Uncle Walter! You are burning to hear it? Well—when he was a senior in Yale College (then only nineteen), he lodged in the house of a widow, who had with her a relative, sent there from the interior in search of health. She was a beautiful young creature, educated far above her condition, as many of the women of New England are, and thus destined to marry ill-mated, or live unmarried. Uncle Walter describes her as of a poetic temperament, susceptible, and truthful, `a Juliet in years, and passionate and sudden love,' he said, `and yet with the shyness of her northern breeding.' He fell desperately in love with her (and he is yet a lover!) They went on blindly happy, till a summons came from her home. While the chaise that was to convey her away was waiting at the door, impelled by his generous temper (inconsiderate as you and I well know it to be), he persuaded her to take the only surety he could give her that he would be true to her, in spite of his youth, of their necessary separation, and of the abyss between the orphan child of an humble Yankee farmer, and the son of a pre-Revolution gentleman of New York—that surety was a marriage before starting. So suiting the imprudent act to the hasty word, while her escort was waiting, they went, on pretext of his buying a book for a farewell gift, to a magistrate and were married. In lieu of wedding-ring, he put on her arm the fellow of the bracelet he gave you—do you re member Mrs. Herbert's curiosity about it? They parted immediately. Uncle Walter wrote to her regularly, but received no replies, till one came saying she was forbidden to write, or to receive his letters. He went directly to New York to confess his marriage to his father, as a preliminary to claiming his wife. He arrived on the very evening of Aunt Sarah's tragedy, and he shrunk from adding a shock and perplexity to his father's calamities. His wife, he knew, was in a comfortable home, and that `no evil,' as he said, `half so bad as the torture of his own feelings could result from a few weeks', or, if need be, months' delay.' How characteristic of dear Uncle Walter, Grace; he always puts off the evil day. His constitutional indolence extends to the decisions of his mind—even impedes the action of his great heart. In less than three months he received a parcel containing the bracelet, with a scrap cut from a country newspaper. He took out his pocket-book, from that a small paper box, and opening it, said, `Here, I have kept them ever since.' He put them into my hand, and turned away. The printed scrap contained only these words: `Died, in this village, on Sabbath morning, Helen Dale, aged sixteen years and six months. “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away—blessed be the name of the Lord!'” The words I have underscored were italicised; it struck me there was some intimation in this, and I asked Uncle Walter `if he knew any thing of her friends?' `Very little,' he replied; `she sometimes spoke of a sister Judith; and I remember once saying to her, “You seem to stand much in awe of that sister of your's?” She answered gently, “She is much older than I—a good sister, and a mother as well.” But Eleanor,' he added, `I thought nothing of her accessories—we were treading on flowers; our present was our world, and it has filled mine ever since with sweet and bitter memories—it has been the one thing real, the rest but shadows.' He continued for a long time to walk up and down the room, his head bent forward, and his hands behind him, as is his way, you know, when he is pensive. I think our poor trifling Aunt Fanny is of the shadows he alluded to, and his dear and only love, the `substance of things hoped for.' “I gave him your last letter to read. He read it, taking off his spectacles repeatedly and wiping them, and returned it to me without any other comment than a heavy sigh. I understood him. He is as easily seen through as a simple child. At the moment of your rupture with H. C., his old hope revived; your news of the lovers at Mapleton extinguished it. I said, `I believe you have seen the little girl Archibald is to marry? How will you like it?' “`Like it? oh, if he likes it, I shall, of course.' After a short silence, he exclaimed (one may easily guess the train of thought that led to the exclamation), `Thank God, she was saved from Copley! That was a greater good than one could look for in this blundering world.' Then he went on ejecting his thoughts as they rose, as if unconscious of my presence. `With her instincts, her high tone, her clear-sightedness, to fancy such a fellow! I don't understand it. A fellow with passion without feeling, mind without culture; living here the contemptible life of an old-world idler; turning his fortune and position to no one good purpose or account. And there was Archy. Good Lord! what a difference. He is an exponent of our institutions. He had no vantage-ground to start from, and he has made himself a man among men; a gentleman—a Christian gentleman. Oh, Grace, Grace, what a miss you made of it!' “`But, dear uncle,' I said (I could not help putting in a word for you, Grace), `Archibald was never Grace's lover.' “`He would have been, Eleanor, but for that fellow—I have seen the infallible signs; but there is no help for it now, and we must learn wisdom from old Di, and not “cry for spilt milk.'” “Poor Uncle Walter! he looked as if it would be a long lesson for him to learn. `How do you like,' I asked him, `the fashion in which Grace casts her future?' “`I heartily approve it—God speed her! We are an un-lucky family in marriages—your exception only proves the rule. No one can have more than one chance in that line; I had mine, Grace her's: we both threw them away. Grace, if she married at all, would of course marry her inferior; and Milton's Adam spoke for all his children, when he said: “`Among unequals, what society Can sort, what harmony or true delight?'” After a dreary pause, while his mind went back to the sad disparity that has marred his life, he brightened, and said, `Thank God, Grace's star has not set—such a light as her's cannot be hid; she has lost the best prize in the lottery. The “next best” is for her to live a true single life; an example much wanted in these times, when the increase of luxury, and the frightful increase of the necessary expense of living, multiplies, at a fearful rate, the number of men and women who are restricted to single life.' “Dear sister, it is a consolation (excuse the word) that your example may send a thrill of courage or of resignation to many hearts. One noble single woman, who devotes her faculties (her ten or her one talent) to the service of God and humanity—it matters not whether it be by maintaining hospitals, reforming prisons, succoring and educating outcast children, or by the noiseless healing visit to the obscure sick, or helpless in mind or body—redeems single life from waste, and from dread and contempt. Let women, who have not a home with a master, and a nursery in it, make themselves welcome in many homes, by making them the brighter and happier for their presence; let them, if so gifted, be artists, poets, sculptors, or painters; let them be leeches, or nurses; let their mission be to the ignorant poor, or the poorer rich; let them fall on any wise and profitable occupation, and the prim and ridiculous maiden-aunt will vanish from our novels, and the Lucretia Mactabs from our comedies, and, what is better, the single gossip will disappear from town and village, and the purring `old maid' from garrets and chimney corners. Why, Grace, dear old Effie is a rebuke to whining wives and careless mothers, with her self-denying, lavish devotion to children, her gentle, kind doings of all sorts to her general family of human kind, and her cheerful economies of her small means of happiness. “If I sigh with Uncle Walter over what I must regard as your great loss, I, with him, too, dwell with satisfaction, with hope and pride, on the mapping out of your future life in your last letter. When I look at your high aims, and survey the great harvest-fields to which you point, ready to the hand of the single laborer, I am almost willing to admit that your's is the highest calling, and to receive St. Paul's opinion, as still of authority, that `the single are happier if they so abide.' And further, that it is merely to guard the social relations and dependencies that marriage is so fenced about with honor, respect, and good report. “You see I am not a pharisaical wife; with Uncle Walter I bid you `God-speed!' and yet, and yet, blessed as I have been and am, the thought of being unwived and unmothered makes me shudder. “And this brings me to my dear husband, from whom I have just received letters. His health is perfectly restored, and he is merely prolonging his stay to complete his examination of the schools of France and Germany. Having once consecrated himself to teaching, he says he will not withdraw from that vocation. He loves young people, and believes he shall work more to his own mind (and as acceptably to his Master) with plastic school-boys than with a congregation. He proposes to give you a high salary as his musical professor. I have answered him that your ambitions are higher—that you will organize a `ragged school,' or something of that sort. Was I right? “Uncle Walter proposes to go himself to fetch you home, and to take May with him; so with the promise of this discreet escort, farewell till Saturday. “Ever yours, E. E.” “P. S. They say a woman always leaves her most important subject for her postscript. I have yet to tell you that Augusta Tallis and her husband came to see me last week. Never in my life have I seen two people so completely changed. The soul has come to Undine, a soul full of peace, and love to God and man: the right love, and the right man. As to Rupert Tallis, he is as different from the fretted, petulant, cynical man he was, as is a ripe day in June from one cloudy, sleety, teasing, stinging, and out-of-season in March. Augusta's `countenance betokened her heart in prosperity.' She is beautiful now, Grace; the sweet serenity of her expression harmonizes with her delicate features, and a rich bloom has taken place of the soupçon of rouge that used to soil her cheek. She asked to go up to my nursery, and there she poured out her heart to me. I reserve details till we meet, but such a capacity of love and happiness as she had discovered in Rupert, in herself. `No other man had ever been so magnanimous in his forgiveness—never by word or look did he recall her past life.' She dilated on the contentments of their present quiet life—`such richness in home; such interest and beauty in its simple accidents and incidents.' Oh, Grace! it was a blessed commentary on her past and present. She has kissed the rod, and it has budded. “After caressing my little girls, who, touching the spring of painful memories, called forth inevitable tears, she looked up brightly through them, and with a smile full of sunshine, asked me for all sorts of patterns of baby-garments, saying, `If it please God to fulfil my hope, I shall look to you, Eleanor, for other models than these—patterns by which to fashion mind and heart!' “E. E.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“My Dear Grace:— “Uncle Walter came home yesterday; for home, my house is to be to him henceforth, unless you steal him from me. The children were in transports at seeing him. `You shall never go away from us again!' cried May, sitting on one of his knees, while Nel stuck, like a burr, to the other. `I never will, May,' he replied, `if your mother can find a place in her little box for me; be it in attic or closet.' `A place for you, Uncle Walter, I guess she can—and if mother can't, I can; you can double up and sleep with me in my trundle-bed!' Nel put in her claim, `You can double up double, Uncle Watty,' she said, `and sleep in my tib.' Uncle Walter laughed; Nel brushed a tear from his cheek, saying, `How funny you are, Uncle Watty! to laugh and cry too!' `I have a room ready for dear Uncle Walter, girls!' I said, whereupon May shouted, `Oh, I know, mother, I know it's for Uncle Walter you have been fixing the dining-room; you might have told me, mother, when I asked you what you got the new paper and paint for; and the new bedstead and book-case, and easy chair, and every thing. It was not fair, mother, not to tell me!' `I only waited, May, till Uncle Walter consented to the arrangement—let him come and see if he can manage in our narrow quarters.' Uncle Walter, the girls at his heels, followed me. I confess, that as I opened the door, I thought the room looked pleasant with its pretty new carpet, fresh chintz curtains and covers, and the little decorations with which I had endeavored to set off the few comforts I had been able to stow in a space fifteen by twelve. After looking round with the sweetest satisfaction, Uncle Walter seized a vase of fresh flowers, and on pretence of smelling them, with childlike guile, hid his tears; he need not. The soft emotions become his robust, manly face. I remember your once telling him that his ever-ready smiles and tears denoted his latent youth, and became him, as blossoms do a rugged old tree. His countenance changed, `But Eleanor,' he said, `this was your dining-room?' `It was, Uncle Walter, and I am getting, in the place of a mere convenience, a living, loving soul.' `I accept it, my child,' he said, `as freely as you give it, and we won't quarrel as to which has the best of the bargain, the giver or the receiver. My spirit will have rest with you, and in this “fifteen by twelve,” space for its freest breath. It has been starved, pinched, and chilled long enough in those big Bond-street rooms, where downy beds did not rest me, nor cushioned chairs give me ease. I hated the place from the moment Grace left the house; and to return to it—pah! it would be the wilderness without the manna!' “He has just gone to his room for the night, after talking much of you, and more of himself than I have heard him in his whole life before; and think of it, dear Grace, he has explained the mystery of the letter we found in the green trunk! Poor Uncle Walter! You are burning to hear it? Well—when he was a senior in Yale College (then only nineteen), he lodged in the house of a widow, who had with her a relative, sent there from the interior in search of health. She was a beautiful young creature, educated far above her condition, as many of the women of New England are, and thus destined to marry ill-mated, or live unmarried. Uncle Walter describes her as of a poetic temperament, susceptible, and truthful, `a Juliet in years, and passionate and sudden love,' he said, `and yet with the shyness of her northern breeding.' He fell desperately in love with her (and he is yet a lover!) They went on blindly happy, till a summons came from her home. While the chaise that was to convey her away was waiting at the door, impelled by his generous temper (inconsiderate as you and I well know it to be), he persuaded her to take the only surety he could give her that he would be true to her, in spite of his youth, of their necessary separation, and of the abyss between the orphan child of an humble Yankee farmer, and the son of a pre-Revolution gentleman of New York—that surety was a marriage before starting. So suiting the imprudent act to the hasty word, while her escort was waiting, they went, on pretext of his buying a book for a farewell gift, to a magistrate and were married. In lieu of wedding-ring, he put on her arm the fellow of the bracelet he gave you—do you re member Mrs. Herbert's curiosity about it? They parted immediately. Uncle Walter wrote to her regularly, but received no replies, till one came saying she was forbidden to write, or to receive his letters. He went directly to New York to confess his marriage to his father, as a preliminary to claiming his wife. He arrived on the very evening of Aunt Sarah's tragedy, and he shrunk from adding a shock and perplexity to his father's calamities. His wife, he knew, was in a comfortable home, and that `no evil,' as he said, `half so bad as the torture of his own feelings could result from a few weeks', or, if need be, months' delay.' How characteristic of dear Uncle Walter, Grace; he always puts off the evil day. His constitutional indolence extends to the decisions of his mind—even impedes the action of his great heart. In less than three months he received a parcel containing the bracelet, with a scrap cut from a country newspaper. He took out his pocket-book, from that a small paper box, and opening it, said, `Here, I have kept them ever since.' He put them into my hand, and turned away. The printed scrap contained only these words: `Died, in this village, on Sabbath morning, Helen Dale, aged sixteen years and six months. “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away—blessed be the name of the Lord!'” The words I have underscored were italicised; it struck me there was some intimation in this, and I asked Uncle Walter `if he knew any thing of her friends?' `Very little,' he replied; `she sometimes spoke of a sister Judith; and I remember once saying to her, “You seem to stand much in awe of that sister of your's?” She answered gently, “She is much older than I—a good sister, and a mother as well.” But Eleanor,' he added, `I thought nothing of her accessories—we were treading on flowers; our present was our world, and it has filled mine ever since with sweet and bitter memories—it has been the one thing real, the rest but shadows.' He continued for a long time to walk up and down the room, his head bent forward, and his hands behind him, as is his way, you know, when he is pensive. I think our poor trifling Aunt Fanny is of the shadows he alluded to, and his dear and only love, the `substance of things hoped for.' “I gave him your last letter to read. He read it, taking off his spectacles repeatedly and wiping them, and returned it to me without any other comment than a heavy sigh. I understood him. He is as easily seen through as a simple child. At the moment of your rupture with H. C., his old hope revived; your news of the lovers at Mapleton extinguished it. I said, `I believe you have seen the little girl Archibald is to marry? How will you like it?' “`Like it? oh, if he likes it, I shall, of course.' After a short silence, he exclaimed (one may easily guess the train of thought that led to the exclamation), `Thank God, she was saved from Copley!

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. “For others say thou dost deserve, and I Believe it better than reportingly.” The moral atmosphere that surrounded our friends at Mapleton during the two days that followed the explosion of the mill, might be fairly typified by what in vulgar parlance is termed a “dry storm;” when the wind stands due east, and does “stand,” not a whiff stirring to relieve the stagnation, and blow away the heavy, dark, dreary mist that settles over and spoils every thing. But toward the close of the second day the “clearing-up” began. Walter Herbert and May arrived, the wind decidedly changed, and “the sun came out.” The fresh guests were cordially welcomed. Mrs. Clifford's house retained that elastic quality, still characterising a few country homes, by virtue of which they expand at the will of the owner. She harbored none of those small selfishnesses permitted to declining age; numbers did not burden her, noise did not annoy her, exigencies and expedients did not perplex her. She could give up her own apartment, turn her only son out of doors, or do any thing a pedantic house-keeper would not do, for a guest that she or Alice loved, or Max desired, or that needed the succor of her hospitality. The first bustle of arrival was over, and May's noisy demonstrations of gladness were subsiding, when Archibald entered, and was met by his honest old friend (his heart betrayed him!) with an air of resignation very different from the feus de joie that usually marked his meetings with his favorite. However, he summoned courage for the sympathy due, as he supposed, to Lisle's happy prospects, and looking from him to Mrs. Clifford, said, “I do not see the young lady whom I too am come to fall in love with.” Mrs. Clifford blushed, as if by proxy for Alice, and replied, “My daughter would have been here to welcome you, but an accident happened the other evening, which threw her off the hinges, and she has not been well since. I have just sent for the doctor,” she added in a lowered voice to Grace; “I don't understand Alice's condition—she is not ill, but she seems fluttered, and flighty, and just now she was quite irritated at Max because he delayed in bringing her a letter from the mail—of course there was no letter of any special interest to expect; and when Max brought one, she did not even break the seal while I was in the room—that dreadful fright has put her all out.” “She has seemed very cheerful since,” replied Grace. “Yes, but,” persisted the anxious mother, “her spirits have alternated with a deep pensiveness. I wish you would coax her to come down—perhaps seeing your uncle will give her a fresh start.” Grace went on her errand. Her uncle's eye followed her. “My child is looking not quite well,” he said, “pale and drooping—and you, Archy, have you too lost ground since you came here? or is it this accident that has knocked you all up?” Lisle made no reply. Mrs. Clifford looked toward him, smiling with a sweet secret satisfaction at her heart, not doubting the cause of his eclipse, and said, “My daughter Alice is our mainspring —nothing goes quite right with any of us when she is away.” “Ah, yes; I understand!” said Uncle Walter, and clapping Lisle on the shoulder, he hummed, “`When I came roun' by Mauchline town, (for Mauchline, sing Mapleton, Archy), “`Not dreading any body, My heart was caught before I thought, And by a Mauchline lady.' Why, Archy, you are falling back into your old trick of blushing like a girl. I thought you had outgrown it.” Archibald murmured something unintelligible, which conveyed but one idea—that he had something to blush for. His eye glanced at Mrs. Clifford. There was a sweet motherly smile on her lips—it was a dagger to poor Lisle. “Would to heaven,” he thought, “I had made an opportunity instead of waiting for one, to tell her of my weakness and presumption, but here I am, wearing false colors before my best friend.” “Alice!” said Grace, as she entered her friend's room, “you do not look as if you needed the doctor!” Alice did not; her cheek was like a fresh-blown rose, and her eyes were moistened with such tears as well up from nature's deepest fountain of happiness. She seemed fluttering with the joy before her, like a bird at the open door of its cage. She held two letters in her hand, one open, and written all over, margins and corners full. “A love-letter?” asked Grace. “Yes; but how could you guess it—and from whom? Guess me that guess, dear Grace.” The gravity of Grace's face was a striking contrast to the playfulness of Alice, as she replied, “Is it from Mr. Lisle?” “Oh!” exclaimed Alice, throwing up her hands, “an Egyptian darkness has settled upon this house! No, no, it is not from Mr. Lisle—it has nothing to do with Archy. If you will let that ring be quiet, that you have taken off and put on twenty times in the last twenty seconds, and listen to me, I will tell you from whom it comes.” No listening could have been more satisfactory than Grace's now became. “This letter you see, Grace, is directed to my mother. You must take it to her for me; and you must give her some explanations before she reads it, which I will now make to you. Poor dear mother, she will feel horribly at first, I know, for she had set her hopes in another direction; but that was not fore-ordained, and cannot come to pass. I have my love-story to tell you, Grace—it's very short, just begun indeed. I shall only give you a few facts, your fancy shall do the filling-up. A year ago, last June, I went with some friends to Rye-beach. The morning after our arrival there, I saw this dear little Daisy of ours on the beach, with her nurse, who told me the child had been brought there with her mother, both for the benefit of sea air. The mother was ill at the hotel. I made friends with the child, and the next morning she brought me an invitation to her mother's room. I found her, a little woman, wasted and very ill, and made almost perfect through suffering. She had married—oh, long ago—and married for love, Grace, a sort of wild Irishman, who took her by storm. He was handsome and eloquent, she said. She had quite a fortune from an aunt, and no parents, no protector, only one brother—a boy then. Her husband turned out a drunkard, and every thing horrid. He squandered her fortune. In the first three years of her marriage, she had two boys born. Seven years ago Daisy was born, the half-alive, suffering child she is now. Well, dear Grace, in this fiery furnace of affliction, there was an angel—Mrs. Maltby's brother Charles—Charles Fletcher.” “The writer of these letters, Alice?” “The same—the same—the same; the best, the most charming—the noblest—” “The `facts,' if you please, my dear child; I am to weave the `filling-up,' you know.” Alice, smiling, reverted to her narrative. “Charles Fletcher was getting on as a lawyer in Boston when his sister's affairs came to the worst. He wrote for the papers, translated for the booksellers, worked day and night, to supply her necessities, and the wretch, her husband, drained her of these precious earnings, by threatening to take her children from her. Her health failed, and her fears lest this poor little helpless Daisy should fall into her father's hands drove her near to insanity. Her brother got possession of the boys, and sent her, with Daisy, to Rye-beach. The day after I first saw her she suddenly became much more ill, and begged me to write to her brother that she felt her death rapidly approaching. She had no help or comfort on earth but Charles, she said. I wrote, and he came. She lived a month; we took care of her together. Such a brother he was, Grace—so cheerful, and yet so sympathizing, with such sweet heavenly thoughts for her, `just the food she needed,' she said. Her weak, wearied spirit seemed to rise on his strong wings of faith and hope. `The moment Charles opens the door,' she said, `and I see his face, and hear his voice, it seems as if sunshine and sweet fresh air came into my room.' Oh, Grace, such a brother as he was!” “And such a lover!” said Grace, imitating Alice's fervent tone. “No, no, Grace. The mill had to explode before we came to that part.” “Ah! I comprehend; but go on with your `facts.'” VOL. II. 12 “Mrs. Maltby took a strange fancy to me, and would not let me out of her sight, except for the refreshment of a drive or walk.” “Charles Fletcher had a simultaneous necessity of the same refreshment?” “Yes, Grace, that is one of my facts. A few days before Mrs. Maltby died, she was thrown into spasms by a letter from her husband threatening to take possession of the children. In this extremity, Charles resolved to take the boys beyond his reach, to California, and establish them in San Francisco. He had previously received great offers from friends there, which he had rejected, preferring Boston, with the slow gains of his profession, to running after sudden fortune. But what was to be done with Daisy? I offered—I could not help it, you know—to take her home with me. Her father did not know of my existence, and would have no clue to her. I wrote to my mother to ask her co-operation; a mere outline—no `filling-up,' Grace. My mother needs none; want is the key to her supplies. We have scrupulously kept our secret. One week after his sister's death, Charles Fletcher sailed for California.” “And you had no explanation before parting?” “Not in words. It would have been neither prudent nor honorable in Mr. Fletcher, his future being uncertain, and a provision for the children his first duty.” “But there was a `filling-up' Alice? looks, tones, as expressive as words, and as binding to your hearts?” “We could not help that, Grace; nor could we help speaking when we met.” “Oh, no; your romantic meeting was a fact that deserved the `filling-up' you gave it. But how quietly we all received the idea that you had been picked up and brought home by a passing traveler!” “Luckily for us, the parlor was dark and empty when we came in, and Mr. Fletcher just laid me on the sofa, and made his escape. To tell the truth, Grace, I was more delighted than surprised to see him. His expected arrival with commercial despatches was mentioned in a Californian letter, which my eye strangely fell upon the other evening, when I was looking over Archy's shoulder at the gossip from Newport—the time that I rushed out, and Archy followed me— do you remember, Grace?” Grace nodded affirmatively. She well remembered. “I was in a horrid fright,” resumed Alice; “I knew Maltby had threatened a deadly revenge, and that he was in New York to await, as I supposed, Mr. Fletcher's arrival; and feeling that Charles was near at hand, I had a most vivid imagination of the worst that could happen. But the fellow took advice, and instead of presenting a revolver, he met Charles at his landing with a writ for illegal detention of the children. Charles gave security for his appearance, and rushed up here. He had but one night to stay. He was delayed on his way, and providentially arrived late. We exchanged some ten words, Grace—just as good as ten volumes. Perhaps you think I was too soon won, but you will not when you know him. Think what a good brother he has been; and good brothers always make good husbands.” Grace was the last person in the world to give a faint sympathy. “It does not matter, dear Alice,” she said, “whether your heart has been taken by storm or siege, so it has fallen into the right hands. The Eastern conjurer, who makes a plant spring from the ground, bud, blossom, and bear fruit while you are looking at it, shadows forth such a love as your's. But what a queer world it is! I am ready to rub my eyes, and ask if I am awake?” “Well!” said Alice, pausing, and looking steadfastly in Grace's eyes, and smiling very archly, “you are not wide awake yet, Grace—but you soon will be; it's dawn now, daylight is coming.” “Give me the letter for your mother,” said Grace, her heart smiling at Alice's prognostic, if she controlled her lips; “I long to have my task over, Alice; I dread her disappointment.” “Oh, so do I; but I did not suspect you knew her delusion. Dear mother! she is a poor dissembler. Who would have taken me for the most discerning person of this superior family? I am the only one that has not been stone-blind. Go, dear Grace; my mother will be perfectly reconciled as soon as she knows Charles—I am sure of that.” Alice spoke from a natural, and, happily, a well-founded faith in her lover. Grace's face was turned from her, or she would have seen the intimation in it that no man on earth could fill up the chasm made by the loss of Archibald. “Besides,” continued Alice, “my mother must have been disappointed at last—Mr. Archy has not profited by his excellent opportunity of falling in love with me, and never would.” Grace stood with the door half open, awaiting Alice's words; she reclosed it. “You are right, dear Alice,” she said, “and your frankness shames me. I will not have any further concealment from you. When Mr. Lisle came back to me in the wood, he told me what passed before you parted from him; he was forced to it, I believe, by a sense of the wrong he had done you, and the greater wrong he had done to his own truth.” “Oh, he told you more than that! You need not confess, Grace—your burning cheek tells his whole story, and I can tell it in two lines: “`My life has been a task of love, One long, long thought of you.'” “You are a diviner, Alice.” “Oh no, Grace, we have been playing at child's play— French blindfold, and my wand alone touched the right person. Why, Grace, I have seen from the first day we were together in New York that he was in love with you; I saw it in the glance of his eye, I heard it, Grace, in the tone of his voice. You see I know the signs, my dear. He was one man when you were present, sensitive to his fingers' ends; and another when you were absent, careless, listless, quite uninspired.” “You are not inspired, Alice,” Grace replied, with rather a sad smile. “There is a mixture of human error with your wonderful clairvoyance. Mr. Lisle frankly confessed to me that, from the moment my uncle told him of my engagement to Copley, he had struggled for the mastery of the passion that he acknowledged had mastered him; and from that moment—he did not say so—but I saw it, plainly, I had sunken fathoms deep in his opinion.” “To rise like a goddess from the waves, Grace, as soon as he knew you were free, and how nobly you had freed yourself.” “He does not know it, Alice.” “Does not know it!—you did not tell him? I shall. I am no longer bound by my old, foolish promise. I will go this minute and tell him, and heap coals of fire on his head. I'll teaze him a little first, though—he deserves it from me. I will copy his moon-struck manner, and quote his own words in his tragic tone: `Do you—can you—will you love me.' Oh, it was shabby of him to offer me an empty casket, but I'll forgive him, and send him off to you.” “No, no, dear Alice, I'll not have him challenged; he must find out the truth before long, and then, if—perhaps—” “No ifs and perhapses, dear Grace. You must have your own way if you must; it will all soon be settled like a book, and then,” she added, her sweet face radiant, “what is to become of your fine-spun plans for your single life? It would have been great; as Max said of Sylvia May, `you would have made a splendid old maid,' but one can't shirk one's destiny, and I knew you were not to make a partie carrée with that glorious trio of Scott's heroines, Rebecca, Minna, and Flora Mac Ivor. No, you and I must sink down into the inglorious herd of married women.” “Now go, you do not look quite so much as you did like the `awful messenger that drew Priam's curtain at the dead of night;' go to my dear mother, and all good angels help you—and me. And oh, Heaven grant that she may never know what a tug poor Archy has had to do the duty she expected of him.” That “it never rains, but it pours,” is an adage destined to be exemplified that evening at Mapleton. Grace returned to her uncle from her long interview with Mrs. Clifford, and told him his hostess begged to be excused till the morning. “Upon my word,” he said, looking into Grace's eyes, where he saw the marks of recent tears, and yet, in her whole expression, the serenity of the securest happiness; “Upon my word, this is an odd place, this Mapleton—breezy, showers, but no clouds. One wonders where the rain comes from.” “You will not be left to wonder long, dear uncle. Secresy has no affinity with Mapleton. A guest is expected to-morrow, and at his arrival, whatever may now seem mysterious will be explained to you.” “I am glad of it. Life is all rather a puzzle to me, and I am not fond of any superfluous mysteries, nor am I fond of being left alone, as you know, my child. May has run off to that weird little Daisy, as you call her, and poor Archy, with all the marks of love upon him, is musing by the lake-side. Ah, here comes that pleasant lad, Max.” “Thank you, sir,” said Max, “and I hope I have come to some pleasant purpose, for I have brought the last Boston paper for you.” “Hallo, Archy,” he called out to Lisle, who was coming in from his lake-side musing, “here's a note for you. I'll ring for candles. I would give five dollars to see the inside of that note, Archy.” Candles were brought, but Lisle seemed not to partake Max's curiosity, for after recognizing the hand-writing, he remained as if indifferent to open the note or not. Mr. Herbert eagerly unfolded the paper, and at the first paragraph that struck his eye, he exclaimed, “Lord bless us!” and reading it through, he finished with dropping the paper, clapping his hands, and crying “excellent, perfectly satisfactory!” and he prolonged every syllable of the last word, so as to emphasize the full contentment of his heart. “Not that we, any of us, care a straw,” he added, resuming the paper, “but it's so fitting. Hear, hear friends. `Newport Items:—The fashionables assembled at this world-renowned watering place, have been startled by the announcement of Mr. H. C*****'s (the millionaire) engagement to the beautiful, rich, and accomplished Miss C****** (“six stars, Grace, after the C”). The contracting parties (with the bride elect's intellectual mother) have left for New York, and are to be married privately in Grace Church.” Walter Herbert looked where he always first looked for sympathy, to Grace, and exclaimed, “Why, my child, you do not even look surprised.” “I am not,” she answered coolly. “I had a letter from my step-mother, this morning, containing the news.” “You had! Why did you not tell me?” “For the best reason in the world, I forgot it.” “That's odd. The letter must be rich. Let me see it, Grace.” She drew it from her pocket. At the first indication of Copley's name, Lisle's eye instinctively turned to Grace's face, and fell to perusing it as one reads a document for life or death, but he read nothing there: not a muscle moved; there was no change from red to pale, or pale to red, till extending the letter toward her uncle, Lisle took it to pass it. Their eyes met. There is a power in the eye to transmit the spirit swifter than the telegraph, more potent than the spoken or the written word. When the cry of “land! land!” assured Columbus of his fulfilled hope, we venture to say there was not a more effulgent joy in his face than in Archibald Lisle's when Grace's eye met his. Walter Herbert read his sister-in-law's letter to himself. We transcribe it for the benefit of our readers. “My Ever Dear Grace:— “I have often remarked to you that the affairs of this life never turn out according to our short-sighted expectations. L'homme propose, et Dieu dispose. Who could have expected that Mrs. Tallis' rash interference with your prospects would have led to Anne's gain. But so it is. (Then followed a deal of twaddle; `she trusted that Anne would not be dazzled with her brilliant future, and that she herself should “continue humble, and occupied with her duties,'” etc., etc.) The letter concluded, “As I have often remarked, every thing is mixed in this world, and truly, my dear Grace, my happiness is alloyed by the thought of your disappointment. “I felt it right for obvious reasons early to apprize you of Anne's engagement, as you might hear it at a time when it would not be pleasant to manifest emotion; now, forewarned, you will be fore-armed. “I feel it also my duty as your only surviving mother, to express the hope that you will learn wisdom from this trial, and put a rein (while you are still young) on your too impulsive temperament. As I often say, a wrong step may (as in the present case) be irretrievable. My kind love to our dear Eleanor. Mr. Copley and Anne would add theirs, but they are at the Yacht-race. It is a true solace to a mother's heart to find them so harmonious in their tastes. “Think with what advantages she will make the tour of Europe. She is wild with joy. But pardon me, dear Grace I would not hurt your feelings. I always say there is nothing so sacred as feelings. “Ever affectionately, and sincerely your attached, “Marianna Herbert.” “P. S.—I hope to see brother Walter in town, and to make satisfactory arrangements about shutting up my house. I regret the inconvenience to him, but of course I do not feel it consistent with my duty to Anne, to let her go without me.” “Bon voyage to them all,” exclaimed Uncle Walter, chuckling, as he threw aside the letter; but after a moment his countenance assumed a graver aspect. He was not a man to look upon a sin, or even a folly with any thing so harsh as scorn, or so comfortable as complacency. “Miserable creatures,” he said, “of ritual religion, ritual moralities, and human policies. We are well quit of them, dear Grace, Ah, friends! many a relation is better in the ending, than in the beginning.” “Much, much better,” said Grace, with an emphasis that startled Archibald from a reverie, in which hope beamed from a mass of bitter feelings, self-reproaches for past blindness, false judgments, fluctuating purposes, and compromises 12* with the affections—the affections of heavenly birth, and destiny, too sacred to be approached by that genius of universal tinkering—compromise.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIV. “Marry! that marry is the very theme I came to talk of—” It was not till after a night of meditation and prayer, and its blessed sequence, sweet sleep, that Mrs. Clifford was able to appear with serenity before her family. It was hard to surrender hopes so long cherished, and so nearly fulfilled; and very difficult to readjust the glass of faith to this new point of view; but she did it, and accepted this trial, as she had others far more grievous, with the sweet and unreserved acquiescence of a submissive child. Charles Fletcher came to Mapleton, and (we borrow Max's expressive slang phrase) “he pitched into all their hearts.” He had not been an inmate of her family twenty-four hours, when Mrs. Clifford confided to Walter Herbert that she could not have believed she should “so soon have come to love him.” No one else, knowing the wealth of her affection, and how conjoined were faith and love in her life, would have doubted it. “It's a good sign,” she said, as if to justify her sudden liking, “that the young man has returned from California unsmitten with the contagious fever that rages there—” “There!” interrupted Uncle Walter; “bless your soul, madam, the infection has spread over the whole country, and through every class, except children at both ends of life— simple babes, and elderly sages, such as you and I, who, in simplicity, have become like little children, and are so near the end that we can see as well as believe, that it will not profit us to gain the whole world and lose our own souls.” “Ah, Mr. Herbert,” replied Mrs. Clifford, “sound health of mind as well as of body, is the best security, at all ages, and in all circumstances, against contagion; and soundness all this young man's conduct indicates. He went to California for an excellent object, and having attained that, he returns eagerly to his profession in Boston—to slow gains, and frugal progressive life.” “You need no studied reasons, Mrs. Clifford, to justify your liking, or dear little Alice's sudden love. He is frank and manly—a man more of deeds than words—and cheerful, a quality we old people love as we love the light; charming manners, too—a rare grace in these northern latitudes; how should he not enter your heart, which in one respect is unlike the kingdom of heaven, for `broad is the way, and many there be that go in thereat.'” “I don't know how you have done it, young man,” he said to Charles Fletcher, an hour afterward, “but your arrival has had a prodigious effect on us all. We were like so many out-of-tune instruments before you came; now we are in harmony, and play the best of music.” “What do you mean, Uncle Walter?” asked May, who stood beside him on the sofa, extremely puzzled—“that you are an instrument to play on, like Grace's piano?” “No, child; I am nothing but an old bagpipe—fit only for weddings and such merry-makings.” “Weddings!” May caught the word with girlish instinct. “Oh I like merry music—I'll have you, dear old Bagpipe, and play on you at Miss Alice's wedding, and Grace's wedding! Won't that be fun?” “Grace's wedding!” echoed Uncle Walter; “Grace will never have a wedding—so she says, May.” Uncle Walter's expressive whistle, sotto voce, finished his sentence. “Oh, I don't believe that, Uncle Walter. Grace,” she called out to Miss Herbert, who was intent on a passage in a book to which Lisle, standing beside her, had called her attention, “Grace, don't you mean to be married, and have a wedding?” (“Ces enfants terribles!”) If Grace heard, she had no need to reply, for, luckily, May's attention was diverted by Max's entrance. He rushed in, his high color heightened, and his eye sparkling. The coming of the joyous lad was usually like letting in a fresh mountain breeze. “What now, Max?” asked his mother. “Oh `there's a good time coming!'” he sang, “come to Mapleton. I expect to see all our `rocks of Gibraltar,' Miss Looly, Miss Sarah, and all, with wedding-rings on yet—it's getting epidemical.” “What do you mean, Max, if you mean any thing?” “I do; there is more than one swallow, or one pair of swallows, come to make our coupling summer in Mapleton —`Single-side' no longer. Martin Seymour stopped me under the old elm, and was giving me the programme of his affairs, when the Major drove up with his splendid greys— and Miss Adeline, of course.” “Let those vulgar people pass on, Max. What of Seymour?” “Mother! the Major and the Clapp-trap are such good game—but they'll keep; and since you will have it so, I'll first tell you about Seymour, and tell you in his excellent Yankee vernacular. He says that `the saw, and one or two other trinkets were saved when the mill blew up, and that he calculates to rebuild soon, and build better than ever; and except that it was awful to have Uncle Nat blowed into eternity, it was a providence, for now nobody disputed that he was deranged, and that was a lasting comfort, both on account of here and hereafter, to Amy and her folks; and it was healing to see how the street pitied him. And Amy had agreed, if they were both spared, to be married next Thanksgiving. She did not feel as if it would be consistent to be married sooner. So, dear mother, there's all of your special protégés, Martin and Amy. Now for the Mexican hero! He beckoned to me as he passed, and pointed to the inn. I followed. He conducted me to Miss Clapp's parlor, and after a little hesitation, and precious little too, he said, with a salute, à la militaire ('pon my honor, mother), to the ever-blooming Adeline, that he had had the happiness to obtain Miss Adeline's affections, and the promise of her hand; whereupon I bowed to the bride-elect, or elector, and complimented her in the novel phrase, `Veni, vidi, vici!' Miss Clapp informed me that her brother, Orondates, is expected this evening, and they proceed to-morrow to New York, there to be married, and to embark for the tour of Europe, Greece—think of Adeline reconnoitering the Parthenon!—Egypt, and the Holy Land! I suppose this tour was the Major's bait. Was it a lover of your's, Alice, or of one of your friends, who, when he was rejected, whined out, `Would the tower of Europe make any difference?' By the way, Archy,” continued Max, without waiting for an answer, “Miss Adeline inquired if I delivered a note she gave me for you some days ago. I did, and told her so. She says it's all-important to the Major, and to her, that it should be answered before her marriage, and she begged me to be sure to remind you.” Archibald started at the sound of his own name. Neither he nor Grace had heard one word of Max's previous rattle, they being bent over the honeysuckle at the door-side, and apparently absorbed in a botanical investigation. “A note!” he said, as if mustering his recollections; “oh! I remember—I beg Miss Adeline's pardon!” and thrusting his hand into the depths of his pocket, he brought up an unsealed note. “Read it aloud, Lisle,” said Uncle Walter; “we all know about your entanglement with that native; let's have the last of her.” The last of her! No, she and our ultra fashionable friends, whose nuptials were solemnized in Grace Church, will be returned upon us by some foreign satirist (Thackeray, if such meat were fit for the gods), as “General Jeremiah E. Bangs and lady,” or Mrs. Horace Copley—as the case may be—a fine lady “from the States,” who shall remark at a Baden ball that some future “Miss Newcome's toilette would do at a Fifth Avenue party,” and these exceptional people will be received, by the European reading public, as illustrating specimens of the social results of democratic institutions. Lisle did read the note aloud. It simply contained a request that he would furnish Miss Clapp with a copy of the certificate of the date of his birth, “to make the Major and me feel secure,” wrote Miss Adeline. “Secure!” repeated Lisle, laughing; “providentially, as Miss Adeline would interpret it, I can do so without delay. In the pocket of my surtout which I had on when I received your telegraphic despatch, Alice, there is a letter from poor old Dr. Bay, in which is enclosed said certificate. I perceived the drift of that, but have never read the letter, nor thought of it since the hour I received it.” As Lisle went into the entry for the letter, Uncle Walter said, with a significant smile—Uncle Walter's lips had hardly been out of a smile for the last few hours—“Our friend Lisle is losing his mind.” “Oh, no, sir,” said Alice, springing up, and whispering in his ear “he has just found it!” As she bent over him, her warm dimpled cheek was close to his lips. He kissed it, and looking at her lover with mock gravity said, “By Jove! I could not help it!” Lisle returned with the letter open in his hand. After glancing his eye at the contents, his countenance changed, and asking Max to put the certificate into Miss Clapp's possession, he hurried off to his apartment. May betrayed the curiosity that others suppressed. “Uncle Walter,” she asked, in a low voice, “did you see how frightened Mr. Lisle looked?” “Frightened? no, May.” “I don't mean frightened, but so different. Think Mr. Lisle had bad news in that letter?” “Pshaw! No, May; it was an old letter from a dead man.” “Mercy, Uncle Walter! I should think he would be frightened. Do go and ask him what is in the letter—do!” “I will, May; I am one of the `obedient parents' who have succeeded to the obedient children of former days.” So, glad of a pretext, he went. Uncle Walter was watching the drifting of every straw in Lisle's path. He tapped at Archibald's door, as if in passing to his own, and called out, “What tidings, Lisle, from the dead to the living?” Archibald opened the door with the open letter still in his hand. His face shone with a new discovered happiness. “Come in, my dear friend,” he said, “and read this letter— it concerns you.” “Concerns me!” exclaimed Mr. Herbert, extremely puzzled, and he hurried out his spectacles, and sat down to the reading by the deepening twilight. “You may skip the first page,” suggested Lisle; “that is merely an outpouring of the good old doctor's affection—he loved me from the beginning.” “And have not I loved you `from the beginning,' you scamp? If there were any truth in instinct you should belong to me, for I have loved you as doting fathers love their `dear and only sons;' but to the doctor's letter.” (We look over Mr. Herbert's shoulder). “Esteemed Young Friend:— (Thus began the doctor's epistle.) “Feeling the pillars of my earthly tabernacle decaying, I am setting my house in order, and among my relative duties is that of transcribing the records I have made of the birth of those whom it has been my happiness to introduce upon this sublunary scene. Accordingly, you will find herein the accompanying certificate under my own hand and seal. And truly it gives me satisfaction to say (I am no flatterer, Mr. Archibald) that my instrumentalities have been seldom so rewarded as in your case; and it is borne in upon my mind to attest my approbation of your life. Its safe commencement, I may claim to be due (always under Providence) to the skill, acquired during my studies with the celebrated surgeon of the ever-lamented Princess Charlotte. “Three cheers for Dr. Bay!” exclaimed Uncle Walter. “My satisfaction has been great in seeing you ripen into a God-fearing and man-loving man—the latter being abundantly proved by your affectionate and dutiful conduct to your late excellent father, your maintenance of his relict, and your unfailing respect and kindness to her, which, she not being a bird of your feather, was not so easy as for water to run down hill; and further by your education of her children, not required by the opinion of society, they being but half blood. And further, was noted by me, your exemplary care in life and death of the interesting orphan Letty, besides numerous benefactions to `Uncle Phil' and others, of which my hands have been the trusted and secret medium. I have taken pride, too, in your uncommon success in your profession, which I foresaw; your legal intellect being clearly indicated to me from the first, by a remarkable cerebral formation; and something better than pride I have felt (and often expressed in private duty) that you have maintained your integrity, and neither tarried long at the wine-cup, or fallen into `the narrow pits' abounding in a city thick-set with temptations and flooded with vice— “Doctor Bay, I shake hands with you!” exclaimed Walter Herbert. “Why, Lisle, he was as loving a fool as I am; but what is this?” “I am now about to impart what I term a professional secret, obtained in my medical walk, and therefore not to be disclosed but for providential reasons. I hear that you are in close friendship with Walter Herbert, Esq., of New York city, and deem that my secret may be a pleasure or a beacon to you. “Your mother had a sister fifteen years younger than herself, the prettiest specimen I ever met. I attended her through a galloping consumption that rapidly developed after a visit to the sea-shore. She died a fortnight after your birth. I had brought her in my arms, and put her in your mother's easy-chair at her bedside. She had seemed quite comfortable that morning; all at once, in a breath as it were, the paleness of death came over her; she fumbled at the wristband of her gown, I unbuttoned it, and a bracelet that was too large for her arm—she had emaciated—fell over her hand— “I see! I see!” cried Uncle Walter; “light your candles, my dear boy, my eyes fail me!” “She took it up, kissed it, and said, `Do, sister, send it to him!' There was a flutter of the heart, and she was gone! Now, Mr. Archibald, your mother was one of the silent kind, over-prudent (if that can be said of a woman); she ever wore a seal upon her lips; but sudden grief—Helen was her idol—mastered her, and her heart gushed out like an opened fountain, and many things, she said (taken unawares) not suitable to repeat; but the amount was that Helen had been privately married to Walter Herbert; that your mother, jealous of the child's honor, had a boiling indignation against Mr. Herbert, and had forbidden all communication with him till such time as he should come and claim his wife. Your mother was a set woman, and Helen of a compliant disposition, a reed in her hands—I speak in no disrespect to your honored parent, for she had the virtues related to setness, justice, rectitude, love, etc.; and besides she had just gone through a period of nervousness, and what was wrong in her usually, was more so, as is often the case with ladies in circumstances. That last look of Helen's, and her last action, impressed me. Her love, clearly, was stronger than death, and it was borne in upon my mind that your mother's judgment had been over strict, and when I looked upon the deceased, so meek and beautiful, so without spot and blemish, like sacrificial doves, I felt for him whom she had loved. And now hearing he is your friend, and thinking he may have long ago repented of all that was wrong in this lamented marriage, you can, at your discretion, inform him, that one, much his elder, pitied more than he blamed him, and that I trust it may cheer his latter days to find his chosen young friend is, as it were, akin to him!” Walter Herbert dropped the letter, and murmuring, “Thank God, thank God,” he fell upon Archibald's neck, and kissed him as tenderly as the father kisses the boy at his knee. As soon as he could command his voice, he said, “The good doctor is right—it is another and a blessed tie to you, Archy; henceforth I hold you as my son. At a future time—not now; now I am too full of both joy and sorrow— I will tell you how my whole life has been pervaded and colored by this early and only love.” And then, as Archibald said, he raised his eyes, and extending his arms in invocation, exclaimed, “My angel in heaven!” and his face was radiant as if the star of his morning beamed from heaven upon him. The twilight had deepened into night, the new moon had dropped behind the hills, the evening-star had followed her, Mars had traversed a broad space in the firmament, Jupiter had risen far enough above the horizon to drop a thread of light athwart the lake, and the lowest star in Orion shone over the eastern hills, when Archibald and Grace, who had been in the light of these skyey processes, but not observant of them, returned from floating on the lake in Max's “sulky.” Finding all the family retired to bed, and oblivious of that periodical duty, they sat down together on the door-step. They had taken no note of the evening hours. These hours had glided from them in mutual histories of their past misjudgments, distrusts, blunders, and failures, and in a blending of their present joy that, like a rushing flood, swept them all away. They were like two beatified spirits on the threshold of another world—behind them darkness, entanglement, and obstruction, before them a land of promise, bright with love and faith, lights now glowing in their firmament, and there to shine forever and forever. A momentary silence, surpassing the offices of words, was broken by a stealthy footstep and a low pettish cry; and turning round, they saw, by the light of the entry lamp, little May stealing in, in her long white night-dress, looking like one of the child-angels in St. Cecilia's choir. “Oh, Grace,” she said, “why don't you come to bed? I have been awake, and waiting for you, ever—ever—ever so long.” Grace kissed her, and smiled, but said nothing. May looked from Grace to Archibald: there too she met a smile of ineffable happiness, and the bright little creature, brightening all over, exclaimed exultant, “Oh, I know— I know you are to be married, Grace, and we shall have your wedding, and Uncle Walter will be my bagpipe.” “You remind me, my dear child,” said Mrs. Clifford, after a long and satisfactory conversation the next day, with Grace, “of a dear friend of mine (that unnamed friend was the great religious and moral writer who is acknowledged throughout Christendom as a beloved master and teacher) who, when he was a young man, addressed a letter to two young women, his intimate friends, adjuring them to consecrate themselves to a single life, in order to demonstrate how happy, beneficent, and honored it might be. He, not long after, married one of these young women, Grace.” “And, dear Mrs. Clifford, he did not `love Cæsar less that he loved Rome more.' He did not disparage one condition, by preferring the other. Am I not true to my theories? While I contended that there might be golden harvests reaped in the fields of single life, that it was not a condition to be dreaded, scorned, or pitied, but infinitely preferable to the bankruptcies in married life, did I not admit there was a happier fate?—and is not that fate mine?” “It is—it is! You are `equal to either fortune,' Grace, `married or single.' May others profit by your theories.” THE END.</field>

I have taken pride, too, in your uncommon success in your profession, which I foresaw; your legal intellect being clearly indicated to me from the first, by a remarkable cerebral formation; and something better than pride I have felt (and often expressed in private duty) that you have maintained your integrity, and neither tarried long at the wine-cup, or fallen into `the narrow pits' abounding in a city thick-set with temptations and flooded with vice— “Doctor Bay, I shake hands with you!” exclaimed Walter Herbert. “Why, Lisle, he was as loving a fool as I am; but what is this?” “I am now about to impart what I term a professional secret, obtained in my medical walk, and therefore not to be disclosed but for providential reasons. I hear that you are in close friendship with Walter Herbert, Esq., of New York city, and deem that my secret may be a pleasure or a beacon to you. “Your mother had a sister fifteen years younger than herself, the prettiest specimen I ever met. I attended her through a galloping consumption that rapidly developed after a visit to the sea-shore. She died a fortnight after your birth. I had brought her in my arms, and put her in your mother's easy-chair at her bedside. She had seemed quite comfortable that morning; all at once, in a breath as it were, the paleness of death came over her; she fumbled at the wristband of her gown, I unbuttoned it, and a bracelet that was too large for her arm—she had emaciated—fell over her hand— “I see! I see!” cried Uncle Walter; “light your candles, my dear boy, my eyes fail me!” “She took it up, kissed it, and said, `Do, sister, send it to him!' There was a flutter of the heart, and she was gone! Now, Mr. Archibald, your mother was one of the silent kind, over-prudent (if that can be said of a woman); she ever wore a seal upon her lips; but sudden grief—Helen was her idol—mastered her, and her heart gushed out like an opened fountain, and many things, she said (taken unawares) not suitable to repeat; but the amount was that Helen had been privately married to Walter Herbert; that your mother, jealous of the child's honor, had a boiling indignation against Mr. Herbert, and had forbidden all communication with him till such time as he should come and claim his wife. Your mother was a set woman, and Helen of a compliant disposition, a reed in her hands—I speak in no disrespect to your honored parent, for she had the virtues related to setness, justice, rectitude, love, etc.; and besides she had just gone through a period of nervousness, and what was wrong in her usually, was more so, as is often the case with ladies in circumstances. That last look of Helen's, and her last action, impressed me. Her love, clearly, was stronger than death, and it was borne in upon my mind that your mother's judgment had been over strict, and when I looked upon the deceased, so meek and beautiful, so without spot and blemish, like sacrificial doves, I felt for him whom she had loved. And now hearing he is your friend, and thinking he may have long ago repented of all that was wrong in this lamented marriage, you can, at your discretion, inform him, that one, much his elder, pitied more than he blamed him, and that I trust it may cheer his latter days to find his chosen young friend is, as it were, akin to him!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Sedgwick's Tales. Miss Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes with a higher aim than merely to amuse Indeed, the rare endowments of her mind depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities with which they are united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of every-day experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace, which is evidently a gift of nature Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted; her delineation of manners decidedly the best that have appeared. — Prose Writers of America Live and Let Live; or, Domestic Service Illustrated.

BY ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE, OF THE ACADEMIE FRANCAISE, AUTHOR OF “DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA.” TRANSLATED BY JOHN BONNER, ESQ. 12mo, Muslin, ?1 00. A calm, philosophical inquiry into the causes of the French Revolution, and the working of the Old Regime. In this work, M. de Tocqueville has daguerreotyped French political society under the old monarchy; shown us where the real power lay, and how it affected individual Frenchmen in the daily avocations of life; what was the real condition of the nobility, of the clergy, of the middle classes, of the “people,” of the peasantry; wherein France differed from all other countries in Europe; why a Revolution was inevitable. The information derived under these various heads, it may safely be said, is now first printed. It has been obtained, as M. de Tocqueville informs us, mainly from the manuscript records of the old intendants' offices and the Council of State. Of the labor devoted to the task, an idea may be formed from the author's statement, that more than one of the thirty odd chapters contained in the volume, alone cost him a year's researches. “I trust,” says M. de Tocqueville in his Preface, “that I have written this work without prejudice; but I can not say I have written without feeling. It would be scarcely proper for a Frenchman to be calm when he speaks of his country, and thinks of the times in which we live. I acknowledge, therefore, that in studying the society of the Old Regime in all its details, I have never lost sight of the society of our own day.” The work abounds with allusions to the Empire and the Emperor. It need hardly be added, that these allusions are not eulogistic of the powers that be. Napoleon has seldom been assailed with more pungent satire or more cogent logic.

THE TENANT OF WILDFELL HALL. By Acton Bell (Anna Bronté.) 12mo, Muslin, 75 cents The wondrous power of Currer Bell's stories consists in their fiery insight into the human heart, their merciless dissection of passion, and their stern analysis of character and motive. The style of these productions possesses incredible force—sometimes almost grim in its bare severity—then relapsing into passages of melting pathos—always direct, natural, and effective in its unpretending strength. They exhibit the identity which always belongs to works of genius by the same author, though without the slightest approach to monotony. The characters portrayed by Currer Bell all have a strongly-marked individuality. Once brought before the imagination, they haunt the memory like a strange dream. The sinewy, muscular strength of her writings guarantees their permanent duration, and thus far they have lost nothing of their intensity of interest since the period of their composition.
