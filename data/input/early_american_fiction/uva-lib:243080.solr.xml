      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II.—1 THIRD YEAR. CHAPTER XXXII. “Our dying friends come o'er us, like a cloud, To damp our brainless ardour, and abate That glare of life which often blinds the wise. Our dying friends are pioneers, to smooth Our rugged paths to death.” The commencement of our third summer was marked by an event very sad to our little self-exiled company in the woods—the death of Mrs. Glenville. Were all here said affection prompts and truth warrants, a volume might be easily written, interesting to most, but specially to that comparatively small yet most excellent class known as religious people: for never had such a brighter ornament or safer pattern. No one, except the inspired person who first gave the exhortation, could more truly have said with her lips to her friends as she did by her life—“Be ye followers of me as I am of Christ.” But none ever was so unwilling to appropriate that or similar expressions: she was too pious, too humble and meek, and childlike ever to think her lovely temper, resigned spirit, and disinterested goodness to be, as they were, a bright and burning light. In early life she was said to be surpassingly beautiful. But danger and temptation from beauty were soon prevented; in the midst of her bloom her enchanting face was for ever marred by the fearful traces of the small-pox. Yet spite of this, and even in advanced life, rare was it to behold a countenance more agreeable than hers; in which was the blended expression of pleasing features, benevolent feeling, pure sentiment, and heavenly temper. The original beauty of the countenance had seemingly been transferred to the heart; whence it beamed afresh from the face, refined, chastened, renovated. Her person was tall and finely proportioned; and so imposing her mien, from a native dignity of soul, that had her original beauty remained, Mrs. Glenville must have always appeared a Grace. She was well educated and extensively read in history, and many other important secular subjects, but her chief reading had always been that best of books—the Bible: indeed, to this, during the last few years of her sorrowful life, her whole attention was given. She, however, read now one other book—a book we name, although with no expectation of its obtaining favour in an unreflecting age— “Ambrose's looking unto Jesus.” And these two books, in the latter months of her life, owing to the nature of her disease, she read on her knees! That disease was an aneurism of the femoral artery, of long continuance, and towards the last exceedingly painful—and which, from an early period of its existence had been pronounced fatal. Yet all this created in her no alarm, produced not the slightest murmur, and abated not her customary cheerfulness and playful vivacity. Nay, she tried even to comfort and encourage our little settlement—being really more joyous in anticipation of a removal to the better land, than we could have been in returning from exile to vast temporal possessions and a beauteous earthly home! Reason was unimpaired till within a very few moments of death; and we all stood around her bed in the rude cabin, while she, placing her hands on the heads of her grandchildren, offered a solemn prayer for their welfare; —and then, with an interrupted voice of the utmost tenderness, she, looking on us for the last, and smiling, said—“I am dying—all—peace!” The king of terrors was there —to her an Angel of beauty—to us dark and frightful!— and he rudely shook that dear frail tabernacle with a severe, perhaps a painful convulsion! But that loved heart, after one throe of agony, was still!—a deep sigh breathed from the quivering lips—and she was not, for God had taken her! A blood ransomed and sanctified spirit was in its true home! Two days after we laid her in a lone and forest grave. And there all were mourners; none walked in that procession of the dead but the people of Glenville—brothers, sisters, children! In that solitary spot we laid her, far away from consecrated ground and the graves of our fathers! But what! though night after night around that spot was heard the melancholy howl of the wild beast!--what! though the great world knows not, cares not to know of that leaf-covered grave! The dust that slumbers there shall live again—and die no more! Better far lie in an unknown grave and rise to the resurrection of the just, than under a sculptured monument amid the lofty mausoleums of kings, if one thence must rise to die the endless death! CHAPTER XXXIII. “Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?” “Where should this music be? i' the air, orthe earth?” Important changes to the Glenville settlement soon followed the death of Mrs. Glenville. It was found necescessary to connect a store with the tannery; and hence, after due deliberation, it was decided that Mr. Carlton should now remove to Woodville and open the store;— the ex-legislator, J. Glenville, to remain and conduct the leather department with old Dick, and also buy up produce for the Orleans market, and all along shore there. He—(not Dick, but Glenville)—was now also a candidate for Prothonotary; although not from elevated and pure patriotism, as in his other campaign; the fact is we had had honour enough and—loss. An eye was now fixed on the salary; we wished to serve the people, provided like other great patriots, we could also serve ourselves; bad men serve only themselves, good ones both themselves and the people. Uncle John and Aunt Kitty were to stay with Glenville in the patriarchal cabin; but Miss Emily Glenville was to go with us to Woodville, where she and Mrs. Carlton would set up an Institute for Young Ladies!—the very first ever established in the New Purchase. In due season, and after innumerable dividings and packings of goods and chattels, off we set; a good two horse wagon and its owner and driver, a robust youth of the timber world, having been hired to take us and “the plunder.” Aunt Kitty insisted on going over to see us safe at our 1* new home and to help fix; and old Dick, poor fellow! looked so wistfully at me, that I agreed to ride the honest creature to Woodville, if he would consent to come back tied to the tail of the wagon; and to that he made no objection whatever. And so he went along too. Nothing important occurred on the journey, only a curious complimentary mistake of the bustling hostess during the night we were compelled to pass on the road. This sagacious lady, seeing a baby in the party, inferred, in Pillbox's style, that somebody was married; and as Aunt Kitty carried the little “crittur,” and made an awful deal of fuss, and Mr. C. used once or twice nursery diminutives, the landlady concluded that if I was “faddywaddy,” Aunt Kitty must be “mammywammy.” Hence, about bed time, she considerately said--“I want to 'commodate near about as well as we can fix it, and so him—(pointing to Mr. Carlton)—and you ma'am—(speaking to Aunt Kitty)—kin have the room up loft thare; and them young folks—(Mrs. Carlon, Emily C. and the driver)—kin have this room down here all alone to 'emselves!” Now, reader, had I a very grave and solemn countenance in my youth, or was Aunt Kitty then just thirty-five years and six months my senior, a very pretty, youthful, looking woman? And what could have deceived our Hoosierina? that when informed of her error, she should have exclaimed:— “Well! now! I never seed the like on it! Why if I didn't sentimentally allow you was the two old folkses, and them two likely young gals, your two oldenmost daters— and that leetle crittur, you look'd like you was a nussin your last and youngenest!” Awh! come now, reader, act fair; for Aunt Kitty was after all a right down good looking body, and as lively as a young lady of plus-twenty. And do not fine, handsome young fellows sometimes marry good looking aged ladies very rich? However, spite of this, next day we came safe to Woodville. But now, alas! was to be the parting with old Dick! True, he let them tie him to the tail of the wagon—but evidently, he was trotted off contrary to his secret wishes, and a good deal faster than he was accustomed to go; for our driver, desirous of reaching the river by night, and having no return load, drove away at a Jehu gait. I, standing at our upper story back window, cried out, as he wheeled into his retrograde position—“Good bye, Dick, good bye! and, would you have believed it? He cocked back his ears!—rolled up his eyes!—and with head and neck almost horizontal, he made not only desperate efforts not to trot, but to slip his halter! In vain! The brute horses in front, were too many for the poor fellow, and away, away they jerked him; till the party, entering the woods, turned suddenly into the road to Glenville, and he was forced round with an ample sweep of his rear quarters; and the last I ever saw of my poor dear old comrade was a most indignant flourish of his venerable tail! For, before my visit to the former home, Dick who would not grind bark alone, and John could not be constantly with him, was sold to a neighbouring teamster; and then, in about a year after, he ended his earthly career as he had begun it—a wheel-horse to a wagoner! Whether from the infirmity of age, or heart-broken at quitting our family, he dropped dead, holding back in his place, on the descent of a precipitous hill!! * * * * * * Poor Dick! poor Dick!—Don't pshaw at me, reader! I'm not crying, any such thing—yes! he's dead now! I shall never see him again! and you will never hear of him. If he has plagued you some in this work, he will not, like some bipedalic and quadrupedal heroes in certain other books, plague you all through! Behold us, then, one step back towards the worldly world. And so now we shall have a little backwoods town life, with an occasional excursion to our country seat at Glenville, like great shop-keepers of eastern cities. Our first step at Woodville was to write and fasten up at the post-office, court-house, jail, doctor's office and other public places, copies of our prospectus for the Woodville young ladies' institute. This was necessary for sixteen reasons; firstly, there was no printing office nearer (then) than one hundred miles; secondly,—Oh! I see you are satisfied—I'm not going on. Wonderful care, however, had been used to make our notice a specimen, both of penmanship and patriotism; and hence more was accomplished in our favour than could nave been done by sixteen line pica and long primer. For instance, heading the foolscap was a superb American eagle, in red ink flourish, and holding in his bill, a ribbon, inscribed—“Young Ladies Institute.” Then came the mistresses' names in large round hand—then the location in letters, inclining backward, like old Dick when wheel-horse—Oh! pardon, he shall not hold back for us again—I was off my guard; and then the word PROPOSE that introduced the page-like matter, in capitals of german text, with heads and tails curled and crankled and interlaced, so as nearly to bewilder the reader about the meaning! And yet, so adroitly was this word contrived, that if one pertinaciously and judiciously kept on through all the windings, he would emerge safe enough at the final flourish of the E; and be not a little triumphant at twisting unhurt and unscared through the labyrinth of “sich a most powerful hard and high larn'd hand write!” Leaving this prospectus to produce its own effects, I set out for Louisville to lay in goods, and also to bring out for our school-purposes, a piano. Now this was the very first that “was ever heern tell of in the Purchus!” and hence no small sensation was created, even by the bare report of our intention. Nay, from that moment, till the instrument was backed up to our door to be removed from the wagon, expectation was on tip-toe, and conjecture never weary. “A pianne! what could it be? Was it a sort a fiddle-like—only bigger, and with a powerful heap of wire strings? What makes them call it a forty pianne?— forty—forty—ah! yes, that's it—it plays forty tunes!” Some at Woodville knew well enough what a piano was, for there, as elsewhere, in the far west, were oddly congregated, a few intelligent persons from all ends of the earth: but these did all in their power to mislead conjecture, enjoying their neighbours' mistakes. After a narrow escape of being backed, wagon and all, into the creek, already mentioned, as having the ford just seven feet deep, and notwithstanding the roughness, or as my friend, lawyer Cutswell used to say, “the asperities” of the road, the instrument reached us, and in tune,—unless our ears were lower than concert pitch. At all events, we played tunes on it, and vastly to the amazement and delight of our native visitors; who, considering the notes of the piano as those of invitation, came by day or night, not only around the window, but into the entry, and even into the parlour itself, and in hosts! Nor did such ever dream of being troublesome, as usually it was a “sorter wantin to hear that powerful pianne tune agin!” But often the more curious “a sort o' wanted the lid tuk up like to see the tune a playin, and them little jumpers (dampers) dance the wires so most mighty darn'd powerful smart!” All this was, indeed, annoying, yet it was amusing. Beside, we might as well have bolted the store, and left the Purchase, as to bolt our door, or quit playing: and beyond the ill-savour of such conduct in a backwood's republic, it would have been cynical not to afford so many simple people a great pleasure at the cost of a little inconvenience and some rusting of wires from the touches of perspiring fingers. An incident or two on this head, and our music may, for the present, be dismissed. One day, a buxom lass dismounted, and after “hanging her crittur” to my rack, walked not, as was usual, into the store first, but direct into our parlour, where she made herself at home, thus:— “Well! ma'am, I'm a sort a kim to see that 'are thing thare—(pointing to the piano)—Jake says its powerful— mought a body hear it go a leetle ma'am?” Of course, Mrs. Carlton let it “go a leetle,” and then it was rapturously encored, rubbed, patted, wondered at, asked about, &amp;c. for one good solid hour, when our familiar made the following speech and retired:— “Well!—pianne tunes is great! I allow that pianne maybe prehaps cost near on to about half a quarter section, (forty acres, valued at fifty dollars.) I wish Jake and me was rich folks, and I'd make him go half as high as yourn, however, I plays the fiddle, and could do it right down smart, only some how or nuther I can't make my fingers tread the strings jist ezactly right!” A very respectable woman, wife of a wealthy farmer seven miles from Woodville, having been one day in town till towards evening, thought she would step over, and for the first time hear the famous piano; and that, although she was to ride home by herself, and by a very long and lonesome road. Our best tunes were accordingly done, and with flute accompaniments; at which our honest-hearted neighbour, raising both hands, and with a peculiar nod of the head and wonderful naivete, exclaimed:— “Compton—(her husband)—Compton said it was better nor the fiddle!—but I'm sentimentally of opinion its as fur afore a fiddle, as a fiddle's afore a jusarp!!” Illustrious shade of Paganini! what say'st thou to that? Once, however, a fine, yet unpolished young man came, but evidently with an impression that some invitation was necessary, as he rapped at the parlour door, and would not enter till invited by Mrs. Carlton. She was playing at the time, and well knowing the cause of the visit, she soon asked if he was fond of music, to which he answered: “Oh! most powerful fond, ma'am; and as I heern tell of the pianne, I made a sort a bold to step in—and maybe prehaps you'd play a tune.” Tune after tune was accordingly played; while the young man, who, abashed at his entrance, remained near the door, now arose and advancing, as if drawn by some enchantment, little by little, he stood at the end of the instrument, absorbed in the music, and his eyes fixed with an intense gaze on the lady's countenance—and at last, when the music ceased at the conclusion of some piece of Beethoven's, he heaved a profound sigh, and thus fervently said:— “If I had a puttee wife and such a fixin, I'd never want nothing no more no how!” Reader! that man had a soul! Sweet sounds and a fair face—(my mother-in-law had been a very beautiful woman, —now touched chords in his heart never before so vibrated; and there came ill-defined but enrapturing visions—so lofty! so aerial! so unlike his cabin, his sisters, and, perhaps, his sweetheart! Wo to the fop who then should even have looked impertinence towards the musician! Ah! sweetheart! for an instant thy image was away! Thy lover had caught a dim glimpse of a region and atmosphere where a more refined lady-love only could live! And so we were now fully under weigh at Woodville, selling, buying, keeping school, and playing the piano— the last important affair being sadly interrupted by the duties of house-keeping. Mrs. C. began more clearly to understand an elegant phrase, addressed to her at our entrance into the wooden country—“the working of one's own ash-hopper.” A girl was indeed caught, (although the creatures were shy as wild turkeys) about once a month; but the success was only small relief to the mistress. It might be a kind of relief from rough scrubbing and washing; from little else, however, as other work must be rectified and often re-cleaned. Did a girl fancy, too, herself undervalued?—was she not asked to the first table with company? —not included in invitations sent us from “big bug” families?—not called Miss Jane or Eliza?—she was off in a moment! Real malice is often mixed with the dudgeons; dough half kneaded is deserted by the young lady—clothes abandoned in the first suds—batter left, and that at the instant you invite your company to sit up, and expect “the young woman that goes out to help her neighbours in a pinch” to be coming in with the first plate of flannel cakes! But if one unfortunately catches a girl who is a mad devotee to some false form of the Christian religion, the employer will be systematically cheated, under the vile plea of higher obligations to attend the thousand and one meetings got up by self-righteous revival makers. We have by such been left on a sick-bed, and when it was by some supposed we were actually dying!—her spiritual advisers held a fanatical meeting that hour, and off she hurried, though paid to nurse! Such a thing would not now be thought worthy record, if we were not too well apprised that even in here, girls, gals, helps, servants, and apprentices, are but poorly instructed by some flaming religionists as to the sacred duties of their offices; and that some of these helps, although paid, fed, clothed, and nursed in sickness by the employers, are, if not expressly taught, yet really encouraged, to slight their work—to be impertinent—and to pay no respect to proper family hours at night, or even to the solemnities of a domestic religion! Hence a New Purchase is not the most pleasant place in the world for boarding-school young ladies—or indeed for any females[1] [1] Women. who have not muscles of oak and patience of an ox. Let then, no fair lady who can remain in an old settlement, venture into a new one from mere poetical reasons; or till she has long and deeply pondered this phrase and its cognates—“to work your own ash-hopper!” And if a nice young gentleman engaged to be married to a pretty delicate lily-flower of loveliness, is meditating “to flit” to a bran new settlement, let him know that out there rough men, with rare exceptions, regard wives as squaws, and as they often expressed their views to Mr. Carlton, “have no idee of sich weak, feminy, wimmin bodies as warnt brung up to sling a dinner-pot—kill a varmint—and make leather brichises!” MORAL. Better to marry in the Range. CHAPTER XXXIV. “—quodcunque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi.” “—I am slow to believe fish stories.” Our Board of Trustees, it will be remembered, had been directed by the Legislature to procure, as the ordinance called it, “Teachers for the commencement of the State College at Woodville.” That business by the Board was committed to Dr. Sylvan and Robert Carlton—the most learned gentlemen of the body, and of—the New Purchase! Our honourable Board will be more specially introduced hereafter; at present we shall bring forward certain rejected candidates, that like rejected prize essays, they may be published, and thus have their revenge. Vol. II.—2 None can tell us how plenty good things are till he looks for them; and hence, to the great surprise of the Committee, there seemed to be a sudden growth and a large crop of persons even in and around Woodville, either already qualified for the “Professorships,” as we named them in our publications, or who could “qualify” by the time of election. As to the “chair” named also in our publications, one very worthy and disinterested schoolmaster offered, as a great collateral inducement for his being elected, “to find his own chair!”—a vast saving to the State, if the same chair I saw in Mr. Whackum's school-room. For his chair there was one with a hickory bottom; and doubtless he would have filled it, and even lapped over its edges, with equal dignity in the recitation room of Big College. The Committee had, at an early day, given an invitation to the Rev. Charles Clarence, A.M. of New Jersey, and his answer had been affirmative; yet for political reasons we had been obliged to invite competitors, or make them, and we found and created “a right smart sprinkle.” Hopes of success were built on many things—for instance, on poverty, a plea being entered that some thing ought to be done for the poor fellow—on one's having taught a common school all his born days, who now deserved to rise a peg—on political, or religious, or fanatical partizan qualifications—and on pure patriotic principles, such as a person's having been “born in a canebrake and rocked in a sugar trough.” On the other hand, a fat, dull-headed, and modest Englishman asked for a place, because he had been born in Liverpool! and had seen the world beyond the woods and waters too! And another fussy, talkative, pragmatical little gentleman, rested his pretensions on his ability to draw and paint maps!—not projecting them in round about scientific processes, but in that speedy and elegant style in which young ladies copy maps at first chop boarding schools! Nay, so transcendant seemed Mr. Merchator's claims, when his show or sample maps were exhibited to us, that some in our Board, and nearly every body out of it, was confident he would do for Professor of Mathematics and even Principal. But of all our unsuccessful candidates, we shall introduce by name only two—Mr. James Jimmey, A.S.S., and Mr. Solomon Rapid, A. to Z. Mr. Jimmey, who aspired to the mathematical chair, was master of a small school of all sexes, near Woodville. At the first, he was kindly, yet honestly told, his knowledge was too limited and inaccurate; yet, notwithstanding this, and some almost rude repulses afterwards, he persisted in his application and his hopes. To give evidence of competency, he once told me he was arranging a new spelling-book, the publication of which would make him known as a literary man, and be an unspeakable advantage to “the rising generation.” And this naturally brought on the following colloquy about the work:— “Ah! indeed! Mr. Jimmey?” “Yes, indeed, Mr. Carlton.” “On what new principle do you go, sir?” “Why, sir, on the principles of nature and common sense. I allow school-books for schools are all too powerful obstruse and hard-like for to be understood without exemplifying illustrations.” “Yes, but Mr. Jimmey, how is a child's spelling-book to be made any plainer?” “Why, sir, by clear explifications of the words in one column, by exemplifying illustrations in the other,” “I do not understand you, Mr. Jimmey, give me a specimen—” “Sir?” “An example —” “To be sure—here's a spes-a-example; you see, for instance, I put in the spelling-column, C-r-e-a-m, cream, and here in the explification column, I put the exemplifying illustration—Unctious part of milk!” We had asked, at our first interview, if our candidate was an algebraist, and his reply was negative; but, “he allowed he could qualify by the time of election, as he was powerful good at figures, and had cyphered clean through every arithmetic he had ever seen, promiscuous questions and all!” Hence, some weeks after, as I was passing his door, on my way to a squirrel hunt, with a party of friends, Mr. Jimmey, hurrying out with a slate in his hand, begged me to stop a moment, and thus addressed me:— “Well, Mr. Carlton, this algebra is a most powerful thing —aint it?” “Indeed it is, Mr. Jimmey—have you been looking into it?” “Looking into it! I have been all through this here fust part, and by election time, I allow I'll be ready for examination.” “Indeed!” “Yes, sir! but it is such a pretty thing! Only to think of cyphering by letters! Why, sir, the sums come out, and bring the answers exactly like figures! Jist stop a minute —look here; a stands for 6, and b stands for 8, and c stands for 4, and d stands for figure 10; now if I say a+b—c=d, it is all the same as if I said, 6 is 6 and 8 makes 14, and 4 substracted, leaves 10!! Why, sir, I done a whole slate full of letters and signs; and afterwards, when I tried by figures, they every one of them came out right and brung the answer! I mean to cypher by letters altogether.” “Mr. Jimmey, my company is nearly out of sight—if you can get along this way through simple and quadratic equations by our meeting, your chance will not be so bad— good morning, sir.” But our man of “letters” quit cyphering the new way, and returned to plain figures long before reaching equations; and so he could not become our professor. Yet anxious to do us all the good in his power, after our college opened, he waited on me, a leading trustee, with a proposal to board our students, and authorised me to publish—“as how Mr. James Jimmey will take strange students (students not belonging to Woodville) to board, at one dollar a week, and find every thing, washing included, and will black their shoos three times a week to boot, and—give them their dog-wood and cherry-bitters every morning into the bargain!!” The most extraordinary candidate, however, was Mr. Solomon Rapid. He was now somewhat advanced into the shaving age, and was ready to assume offices the most opposite in character; although justice compels us to say Mr. Rapid was as fit for one thing as another. Deeming it waste of time to prepare for any station till he was certain of obtaining it, he wisely demanded the place first, and then set to work to become qualified for its duties, being, I suspect the very man, or some relation of his, who is recorded as not knowing whether he could read Greek, as he had never tried. And, beside, Mr. Solomon Rapid contended that all offices, from president down to fence-viewer, were open to every white American citizen; and that every republican had a blood bought right to seek any that struck his fancy; and if the profits were less, or the duties more onerous than had been anticipated, that a man ought to resign and try another. Naturally, therefore, Mr. Rapid, thought he would like to sit in our chair of languages, or have some employment in the State college; and hence he called for that purpose on Dr. Sylvan, who, knowing the candidate's character, maliciously sent him to me. Accordingly, the young gentleman presented himself, and without ceremony, instantly made known his business thus:— “I heerd, sir, you wanted somebody to teach the State school, and I'm come to let you know I'm willing to take the place.” “Yes, sir, we are going to elect a professor of languages who is to be the principal, and a professor —” “Well, I don't care which I take, but I'm willing to be the principal. I can teach sifring, reading, writing, jogger-free, surveying, grammur, spelling, definitions, parsin —” “Are you a linguist?” “Sir!” “You of course understand the dead languages?” “Well, can't say I ever seed much of them, though I have heerd tell of them; but I can soon larn them—they aint more than a few of them I allow?” “Oh! my dear sir, it is not possible—we—can't—” “Well, I never seed what I couldn't larn about as smart as any body —” “Mr. Rapid, I do not mean to question your abilities; but if you are now wholly unacquainted with the dead languages, it is impossible for you or any other talented man to learn them under four or five years.” “Pshoo! foo! I'll bet I larn one in three weeks! Try me, sir,—let's have the furst one furst—how many are there?” “Mr. Rapid, it is utterly impossible; but if you insist, I will loan you a Latin book —” “That's your sorts, let's have it, that's all I want, fair play.” Accordingly, I handed him a copy of Historiæ Sacræ with which he soon went away, saying, he “didn't allow it would take long to git through Latin, if 'twas only sich a thin patch of a book as that.” In a few weeks, to my no small surprise, Mr. Solomon Rapid again presented himself; and drawing forth the book began with a triumphant expression of countenance:- “Well, sir, I have done the Latin.” “Done the Latin!” “Yes, I can read it as fast as English.” “Read it as fast as English!!” “Yes, as fast as English—and I didn't find it hard at all.” “May I try you on a page?” “Try away, try away; that's what I've come for.” “Please read here then, Mr. Rapid;” and in order to give him a fair chance, I pointed to the first lines of the first chapter, viz; “In principio deus creavit caelum et terram intra sex dies; primo die fecit lucem,” &amp;c. “That, sir?” and then he read thus, “in prinspo duse cree-vit kalelum et terrum intra[2] [2] Our yankee linguists will rejoice to know that Mr. Rapid pronounced the a just as flat and calfish as themselves; as they thus have untu-tored nature on their side, just as the Egyptian king had the goats and the babies on his. sex dyes—primmo dye fe-fe-sit looseum,” &amp;c. “That will do, Mr. Rapid —” “Ah! ha! I told you so.” “Yes, yes—but translate.” “Translate?!” (eyebrows elevating.) “Yes, translate, render it.” “Render it!! how's that?” (forehead more wrinkled.) “Why, yes, render it into English—give me the meaning of it.” “Meaning!!” (staring full in my face, his eyes like saucers, and forehead wrinkled with the furrows of eighty)— “Meaning!! I didn't know it had any meaning. I thought it was a DEAD language!!” Well, reader, I am glad you are not laughing at Mr. Rapid; for how should any thing dead speak out so as to be understood? And indeed, does not his definition suit the vexed feelings of some young gentlemen attempting to read Latin without any interlinear translation? and who inwardly, cursing both book and teacher, blast their souls “if they can make any sense out of it.” The ancients[3] [3] Like the Bible, the dead languages are in bad odour in the Independent Republican Common Schools, under Foreign influence. may yet speak in their own languages to a few; but to most who boast the honour of their acquaintance, they are certainly dead in the sense of Solomon Rapid. Our honourable board of trustees at last met; and after a real attempt by some, and a pretended one by others, to elect one and another out of the three dozen candidates, the Reverend Charles Clarence, A.M., was chosen our principal and professor of languages; and that to the chagrin of Mr. Rapid and other disappointed persons, who all from that moment united in determined and active hostility towards the college, Mr. Clarence, Dr. Sylvan, Mr. Carlton, and, in short, towards “every puss proud aristocrat big-bug, and darn'd blasted Yankee in the New Purchase.” CHAPTER XXXV. “Dic mihi, si fueris tu leo, qualis eris?” “Let me play the lion too; I will roar that I will do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the duke say, `Let him roar again, let him roar again.' ” Scarcely had our college excitements subsided, when we were favoured by a visit from two apostolic new lights. These holely men worked by inspiration, and had from heaven patent ways of converting folks by wholesale—by towns, villages, and settlements; although it must be owned, the converts would not stay converted. And yet these men did verily do wonders at Woodville, as much so as if by Mesmerism or Mormonism or Catholicism they had magnetised and stupefied all our moral and spiritual phrenological developements! If the doctrine be true, as some religious editors assert, and we suppose on good authority, that the sect which can in the shortest time convert the most is the favourite with heaven, then our new lights deserved the appellation they gave themselves—Christ ians. Our priests depended on no “high larnin,”—set no apples of gold in frames of silver, but despised “man-hatch'd fillosofees;” and we may add, even harmless grammar, being as they said “poor, unlarn'd, ignorant men,” and also, unshaved, uncomb'd, and fearfully dirt-begrimed—close imitators, as they insisted, of primitive Christianity. All they did was “goin from house to house a eatin and drinkin sich as was set afore them,” bellowing prayers, snivelling and sobbing, and slobbering over man, woman, and child, and “a begginin and beseechinin on them to come to meetin.” And as meetings were held at every hour of every day and every night, we lived on the trot in going to and from them—becoming thus a very peculiar, if not a very good people. At meeting, our venerable teachers prayed as loud and pertinaciously as the priests of Baal, aided, however, by amateurs in the congregations; yet with it all, we never advanced beyond oh!-ing and ah!-ing. Still, definite petitions were often presented, some for “onreginerit world-lins,” some for “hypocrit professors,” and many “for folks what believed in John Calvin's religion and hadn't never been convarted.” But as it was of importance to have certain persons saved, and the divinity of the new lights might not fully understand who was meant, names were metioned in prayer, as “dear brother Smith,” or poor 2* “dear sister Brown,” and sometimes titles were added, as “dear Squire Goodman,” or “dear Major Meanwell.” I never had the pleasure of hearing the bulls of Bashan roar; yet, having heard our new light preachers, I can now form a better conjecture as to that peculiar eloquence; at all events, our two preachers foamed like a modern bull worried by boys and butchers' dogs, and never gave over till exhausted. Often what they said was unknown, as their words seemed to burst asunder as soon as let out— peculiar shells from wonderful mortars! And these two personages as far excelled poor Philip in noise, grimace, and incoherence, as he excelled in those qualities, a delicate divine of the nineteenth century, who reads a sleepy second-rate didactic discourse of a warm afternoon in dog-days, in Pompous Square church; and that when the Rev. Doctor Feminit fears the bronchitis. And yet by this simple machinery, and well worked, in about two weeks our new lights had converted every man, woman, and child in Woodville, except Dr. Sylvan, Mr. Carlton, and some other half dozen hardened sinners that would “stout it out any how!” And now, from every house, alley, grove, orchard, resounded forth curious groans, outcries, yells, and other hell-a-beloo's of private prayer! For all this was called private prayer!—the Scriptures, indeed, directing otherwise; but Barton Stone, and Campbell Stone can do much more with people out there than Peter Stone the apostle; and men naturally love the fanatical Pharisaism of pseudo-inspired teachers, councils and conclaves. An opinion was held by most of our fanatics, that direct, earnest, and persevering prayer would result in the instantaneous conversion of any one in whose favour it was made; and of course to the most opposite creeds! This naturally led to some ridiculous consequences; for it soon was argued that if an unregenerate man could be got by any art or contrivance, or coaxing, to pray right earnestly for himself, and cry out loud and long for mercy, he would be immediately converted; nay, it was held to be efficacious if he could be forced by physical means to pray! Hence among other things of the sort, one of our domestic chaplains, a very large and fat man, now stirred up and enlivened by this visit of the good men, overtook a neighbour in the woods going to meeting, and after having in vain exhorted the person “to fall right down on his knees and cry for mercy,” he suddenly leaped on the incorrigible rascal, and cast him to the earth; and then getting astride the humbled sinner, he pressed him with the weight of 225lbs avoirdupois, till he cried out with sufficient earnestness and intensity to “get religion!” Nor did this convert made by so novel a papistical engine fall away any sooner than most other converts mechanically forced, although by different contrivances—he hung on some weeks. Besides, if little children in western New-York were whipped with a rod into the kingdom of heaven, why should not a stout sinner, too big for that discipline, be pommelled into the same kingdom in the New Purchase, by Bishop Paunch? And would not more persons have been converted to Oberlinism, Finneyism, or Abolitionism, or Anyism, if, after the manner with our new lights, folks had more frequently been characterized by their entire names and employments, when prayed for? Indeed, one distinguished lawyer in Western New-York, always ascribed his non-conversion, after innumerable prayers made for him in public, and even by name, to the unfortunate omission of his middle name! Religious reader! do not mistake us; we are laughing at Satan's delusions! And we lived long enough to find true what we once heard a very learned, talented and pious minister of the Gospel say, that “all such excitements from false religions were sure to be followed by infidelity.” Our evangelical churches were for a time deserted; our family altars abandoned; our domestic intercourse ruined; the Sabbath desecrated; the sacred name profaned, and his attributes sneered at; and avowed and flaming converts to fanaticism were, in two or three years after, reeling drunkards, midnight gamblers, open and unblushing atheists! Nay, assembled in a certain grog-shop—(out there appropriately called “a doggery”)—three years after did some of the man-made converts form a horrible crew that tied up against the wall one of their party in a mock crucifixion! —and setting fire to rum poured on the floor, they called it —“the blazes of hell!!” But a religious incident reminds me of my friend, Insidias Cutswell, Esq. And his history adds to the many instances of self-education and self-elevation. His career, it was said by his political enemies, began with his being a musician to a caravan of travelling animals; but it argues great intrinsic genius, that a man ever made the attempt to rise from such a life, and had skill and tact to use opportunities, by thousands in like circumstances suffered to pass unheeded. Rise, however, Mr. Cutswell did, till in all that country he stood intellectually pre-eminent, and was justly celebrated for learning, enterprise, skill in his legal profession, and, as a political leader. Since then he has stood on elevated pinnacles, both east and west; and had his spiritual man been good as the intellectual, there would he be still standing;—and perhaps higher. Contrary to the old saws, “virtue is its own reward” and “honesty is the best policy” moral excellency does not always meet with earthly rewards; but yet, the retirement of some talented men, is occasionally owing to moral causes rather than political ones. And hence, many lamented that this gentleman had not been as good as he was great. Mr. C. was a good Latin and Greek scholar, and well acquainted with antiquities and other subjects cognate with the classics. He was deeply versed in the books of law, and extensively read in history, political economy, agriculture, architecture, chemistry, natural philosophy, and metaphysics; and he was, moreover, an excellent orator, using in his speeches the best language and with the just pronunciation. But,[4] [4] But, is here an adversative conjunction; commonly employed after high praise of one's friends. my friend had two venial faults; one in common with most politicians out (?) there, and one peculiar to himself —maybe. The first of these, was selfishness, and its consequence moral cowardice. Hence, little reliance could be placed in Mr. Cutswell by his friends—his enemies had in this respect the advantage of his friends. And hence, he had continual resort to log-rolling expedients; to some of doubtful morality; and to some positively sinful, in order to acquire or retain political ascendancy. Still, he was the most sagacious man I ever knew at making political somersets; for he turned so adroitly and so noiselessly, as to cheat the eyes of beholders, and make it doubtful often whether he was on his head or his feet; indeed, he kept such a continual whirl as to seem always in the same place, and yet he was always in a different one! Or to change figures, he never turned with the tide, but watching the symptoms of ebbs and flows he turned a little before the tide; and thus, he always passed for a meritorious, patriotic, people-loving leader of the true and honest party—i. e. the strongest; instead of a tag-rag and bob tailed follower in search of loaves and fishes. Yea! he so managed that the world usually said “Well, Cutswell's friends have deserted him, poor fellow!”—when all the time Mr. Insidias Cutswell, poor fellow, had deserted them! The other foible of his was a grand deportment put on like a cloak when he entered elevated society, but laid aside in his chambers or among the canaille. Doubtless this arose from a mistaken notion of what constitutes good behaviour as he was passing from the grub to the winged state; and, maybe, to conceal that he had not always soared but sometimes creeped. For instance, nothing could transcend the pomp of his manner and dress on some occasions, when from home, unless a New Purchase “Gobbler” in the gallanting season; and then his style of taking snuff when in full costume and under the eye of magnates, was equal to a Lord Chamberlain's—it made you sneeze to witness it! First came an attitude—so grand!—it looked as if it had been studied on a cellar door under the windows of a print shop, from an engraving of Cook, or Kean, or Kemble in royal robes at the acme of his sublime! Oh! the magnificence of that look! And next, the polished box of fragrant sternutatory powder (which he took instead of snuff) would be extracted from the receptacle of an inner vest, a single finger and thumb being delicately insinuated for that duty; and the box thus withdrawn with so bewitching a grace would then be held a moment or two till my lord had completed some elaborate period, or till his deep interest in the absorbing nothings you were uttering should seem suspended by your own pausing. At that instant, his eye glancing in playful alternation from his friend's face to the box, he would perform a scale of rapid taps on the side of the box with the index finger of the dexter hand to wake up the sternutatory inmate; after which, modestly removing or opening the lid, he would, in the manner of Sacas, the Persian cup-bearer, first present the delicious aromatic for your touch, and then with his own finger and thumb a moment suspended in a pouncing position, he would suddenly dart on to the triturated essence and snatch hurriedly thence the tiniest portion possible. Arresting now his hand half way in its upward flight, the pinch downward yet at the tips of the finger and the thumb, he would for the last time look with an interesting smile into his friend's face, and in the midst of that gay sunshine, suddenly turning the pinch under his own olfactory organ, he would inhale the perfume with the most musical sniffle imaginable! Retrograde motions and curves of becoming solemnity, amplitude and grace, would close the box and restore it to the inner vest—and so Mr. Cutswell would have snuffed! Impatient folks may think it takes long to describe a pinch; but, then, it took still longer to perform one. Mr. Cutswell, among other matters, was no mean performer on the violin; and on one occasion, at a private concert at my house, forgetting his usual caution, he entertained me with an anecdote about his fiddle and his Bishop. For be it known, that like other politicians, Mr. C. was a theoretical member of a religious people, who looked on fiddle-playing as on the sin of witchcraft—although I do not know whether he had ever received the rite of confirmation; yet nothing but his high standing saved him from an excommunication, that out there would speedily have been visited on a poor player. Still his Bishop was a faithful shepherd's dog, and hesitated not to growl and bark, if he did to bite; being, also, one who prayed for men sometimes by name, and at them often by description. And so he contrived once to pray at Mr. Cutswell's fiddling or rather against his fiddle; and nothing could ever so belittle that instrument as this preacher's periphrastic abuse of that curious compound of catgut, rosin, and horsehair. “I was present,” said Mr. Cutswell, laying down his fiddle and bow upon our piano,—“some few evenings since, after the discharge of my legal duties at the court house—(attitude commencing for taking snuff,)—present, Mr. Carlton, in the prayer-room of our chapel, a large con-course of members being congregated for the customary weekly devotions.” (snuff box out.) “Among others in the apartment, was our venerable Bishop.” (Box tapped and opened.) “He is a good and worthy man, sir; but sub rosâ not wholly exempt from prejudice. Indeed, as to music generally, but more especially that of the violin,— (finger and thumb pouncing)—he entertains the most erroneous sentiments;—(pinch going upwards)—and I fear that he regards both myself and my instrument with feelings of acerbity.” (Hem!—pinch inhaled.) In the course of his prayer this evening, he contrived to administer to myself in particular;—(lid closing)—but also to you, Mr. Carlton and all other gentlemen that handle the bow,—(box “being” returned)—the following very severe and appropriate admonition, and in the exact words I now quote: “ `Oh! Lord! oh!—I beseech thee to have marsy on all them there poor sinners what plays on that instrumint, whose sounds is like the dying screech of that there animal out of whose intrils its strings is made!' ” Amen!—at a venture! (Pompey or Cæsar.) CHAPTER XXXVI. “Forgive my general and exceptless rashness, Perpctual sober gods! I do proclaim One honest man—mistake me not—but one.” “What find I here? Fair Portia's counterfeit? what demi-god Hath come so near creation?” This chapter is devoted to a man;—Mr. Vulcanus Allheart. And, although he will rap our knuckles for smiling at a few smileable things in him, Mr. Allheart will not be displeased to see that Mr. Carlton, the author, remembers his friend, as Mr. Carlton the storekeeper and tanner, always said he would, when we blew his bellows for him or fired rifles together. During a life some what peculiarly chequered, we have both by land and sea been more or less intimate with excellent persons in the learned professions, and in the commercial, agricultural and mechanical classes; but never out of the circle of kinsfolk, including the agnati and the cognati, have I ever so esteemed, ay. so loved any one as Vulcanus Allheart. And who and what was he? He was by birth a Virginian, by trade a blacksmith, by nature a gentleman, and by grace a Christian; if more need be said, he was a genius. Ay! for his sake to this hour I love the very sight and smell of a blacksmith's shop; and, many a time in passing one, do I pause and steal a glance towards the anvil, vainly striving to make some sooty hammerer there assume the form and look of my lame friend!—for he was lame from a wound in his thigh received in early life. Oh! how more than willing would I stand once more and blow his bellows to help him gain time for an evening's hunt, could I but see anew that honest charcoal face and that noble soul speaking from those eyes, as he rested a moment to talk till his iron arrived at the proper heat and colour! But let none suppose Vuleanus Allheart was a common blacksmith. He was master both of the science and the art, from the nailing of a horse-shoe up to the making of an axe; and to do either right, and specially the latter, is a rare attainment. Not one in a million could make an axe as Allheart made it; and hence in a wooden country, where life, civilization, and Christianity itself, are so dependent on the axe, my blacksmith was truly a jewel of a man. His axes, even where silver was hoarded as a miser's gold, brought, in real cash, one dollar beyond any patent flashy affairs from New England, done up in pine boxes and painted half black, while their edge-part was polished and shiney as a new razor—and like that article, made not to shave but to sell; and all this his axes commanded, spite of the universal nation, all-powerful and tricky as it is. No man in the Union could temper steel as my friend tempered; and workmen from Birmingham and Sheffield, who sometimes wandered to us from the world beyond the ocean, were amazed to find a man in the Purchase that knew and practised their own secrets. Necessity led him to attempt one thing and another out of his line, till, to accommodate neighbours, (and any man was his neighbour) he made sickles, locks and keys, augurs, adzes, chisels, planes, in short, any thing for making which are used iron and steel. His fame consequently extended gradually over the West two hundred miles at least in any direction; for from that distance came people to have well done at Woodville, what otherwise must have been done, or a sort of done, at Pittsburgh. Nay, liberal offers were made to Allheart to induce him to remove to Pittsburgh; but he loved us too much to accept them; and beside, he was daily becoming richer, having made a very remarkable discovery, which, however, he used to impart to others for a consideration—viz. he had found out the curious art of beating iron into gold. My friend was indeed the great “Lyon” of the West.[5] [5] It is hoped all the “Lyon's” friends of Philadelphia will patronize this book. Mr. Allheart's skill was great also in rifle-making, and also naturally enough in rifle-shooting. I have compared Pittsburgh and Eastern and Down-eastern rifles with his, (for the one concealed in my chamber is a present from Allheart,) but none are so true, and none have sights that will permit the drawing of a bead so smooth and round. Does any maker doubt this? Grant me three months to regain my former skill, and I stake my rifle against all you have on hand, that she beats the things, one and all, eighty-five yards off hand—or (as I shall only give back your articles) I'll try you for the fun and glory alone! By the way, do you shoot with both eyes open? If not, let me commend the practice, both from its superiority and because it may save you from killing your own wife, as it did Mr. Allheart once. He excelled, we have intimated, as a marksman. Perhaps in horizontal shooting he could not have a superior; for in his hands the rifle was motionless as if screwed in one of his vices; and thence would deliver ball after ball at fifty, sixty, or seventy yards, into one and the same augur hole. For him missing was even difficult; and all I had ever heard of splitting bullets on the edge of axe or knife, hitting tenpenny nails on the head, and so forth, was accomplished by Allheart. And his sight had become like that of the lynx; for at the crack of the gun he would himself call out where the ball had struck. Nor is all this so wonderful if we recollect that many years in proving rifles he practised daily; indeed target-shooting was a branch of his business—and in it his skill became rare, ay! even bewitching! His place for making these daily trials was at first a large stump some seventy yards distant on the far side of a hollow, against which stump was fixed his target; and along that ravine his wife, a pretty young woman, used to pass and repass to get water from a spring at the lower end. Her almost miraculous escape in that ravine I shall give in Mr. Allheart's own words, although his idiom was slightly inaccurate and provincial. “You say, why can't we shoot across the holler agin that ole walnut stump yander? I ain't pinted a rifle across thare for four year—and never intend to no more.” “Why so, Vulcanus? I'm sure 'tis a capital place for our mark.” “Well, Mr. Carlton, I'll tell you, and then you wont wonder. One day, about six months after we was furst married, I had a powerful big bore[6] [6] A rifle of large calibre—for war and buffalo. to fix for a feller going out West; and so I sit down just here—(at the shop door)— to take it with a rest agin a clap-board standing before that stump, and where I always before tried our guns. I sit down, as I sort a suspicioned the hind sight mought be a leetle too fur to the right, and I wanted to shoot furst with allowance, and then plump at the centre without no allowance—and then to try two shots afterwards off-hand. Well, I got all fixed, and was jeest drawing a fine bead, and had my finger actially forrard of the front triggur—(and she went powerful easy)—and was a holdin my breath—when something darkened the sight, and my left eye ketch'd a glimpse of something atween me and the dimind—and I sort a raised up my head so—and there was Molly's head (Mrs. Allheart's)—with the bucket in her hand a goin for water! She pass'd you know in a instant, almost afore I could throw up the muzzle; but, Mr. Carlton, if I hadn't a had both eyes open or no presence of mind, she'd a been killed to a dead certainty! I unsot the triggurs and went right in; and for more nor two hours my hand trembled so powerful I couldn't hold a hammer or use a file. And that's the reason I never fired across to that ole stump since, and why I never will agin.” But another reason for shooting with both eyes open is, that a curious experiment in optics cannot conveniently be made with one eye closed—an experiment taught me by Mr. Allheart. And hence I would now commend both our book and the experiment to all spectacle-makers and spectacle-wearers—to all ladies and ladies' gentlemen with quizzing glasses—in fact to all persons with two or more eyes, and all speculative and practical opticians. EXPERIMENT. Place over the muzzle of your loaded rifle a piece of paste-board about four inches square, and so as entirely to prevent the right eye while looking steadily on the bead in the hind sight from seeing the diamond mark in the target placed twenty yards from you; then keep the left eye fixed immoveably on the diamond, and stand yourself without motion thus for a few seconds; and then will the thick paper over your muzzle disappear, and you will see or seem to see the diamond mark with your right eye and mixing with the bead—touch then your “forrard” trigger and your ball is in the centre of the target. A dead rest is indispensable for this experiment. N.B.—If this experiment properly done fails, I will give you a copy of this work; provided, if I myself can successfully perform it, you will purchase two copies. When it is said Mr. Allheart made rifles, be it understood as certain rules of grammar, in the widest sense; for his making was not like a watch-maker's a mere putting parts and pieces together, but our artist made first all the separate parts and pieces, and then combined them into a gun. He made, and often with his own hand, the barrel— the stock—the lock—the bullet moulds, complete; the brass, gold, or silver mountings; the gravings, the everything! And each and every part and the whole was so well executed, that one would think all the workmen required to make a pin had been separately employed upon the rifle! He even made the steel gouges for stamping names on his own work, and also for stamping type-founders' matrices; he made, moreover, tools for boring musical instruments. And this last reminds me that Allheart was the most “musical blacksmith” I ever knew—more so probably than our learned blacksmiths. Not only could he play the ordinary and extraordinary anvil tunes with hammers of all sizes, making “sparks” and points, too, of light flash out much warmer and far more brilliant than ever sprang from the goat-strings of the Italian Maestro under the flaggellating horse-hair, but Allheart played the dulcimer, a monotone instrument shaped like an æolian harp, and done with a plectrum on wire strings; and could, beyond all doubt, have easily played a sackbut, psaltery and cymbals! He soon became enamoured of the flute; and on my proposing to give him lessons, he purchased an instrument and attended regularly at my house one or more evenings of every week for two years, till he became as great a proficient as his master, and from that to the present time (as he lately wrote me) he has been the conductor of the Woodville Band. Perhaps my friend's musical enthusiasm may be better understood from the following little incident. His hands and fingers were nearly as hard as cast-iron; but this, while no small advantage in fingering the iron strings of a dulcimer, or in playing on the sonorous anvil, was a serious disadvantage in flute-playing; for the indurated points of his fingers stopped the holes like keys with badly formed metallic plugs, and permitted the air to leak out. On several occasions I had admired secretly the fresh and polished look of his finger-points when he came to take lessons; till once he accidentally, and with the most delightful naivete, unfolded the cause in answer to the following indirect query:— “You are quite late to-night, Allheart?” “Yes—ruther—but some customers from Kaintuck stopped me, and after that I had to stay till I filed down my fingers!” My friend was besides all this a painter. And verily, as to the lettering of signs, the shading, the bronzing, the peppering and salting, and so forth, I defy any first-rate glazier any where to beat Allheart; for he yet does signs for his neighbours, and more from the goodness of his heart and the love of the arts than for gain. To be sure, formerly he would mis-punctuate a little, placing commas for periods and periods where no diacritical mark was needed —although I do believe he sometimes, like a wag of a printer, only followed copy. One thing is certain, he never improperly omitted a capital, though he may have put such in where it might have been omitted; but then, this only rendered the name more conspicuous, and the sign itself altogether more capital. Lettering was not, however, his sole forte; he aspired to pictorial devices, such as vignettes; and at last he ventured boldly upon portraits and even full-length figures. His own portrait was among the very first he took, and that by means of a mirror; but, whether from modesty or want of skill, or want of faithfulness in the glass, the likeness was not very flattering. And yet one thing done by our New Purchase artist ought (I speak with becoming deference) to be imitated by many eminent eastern portrait-painters. “What is that, sir?” Well, I am actuated by the best of motives, gentlemen, as it was a peculiarity in Mr. Allheart's finish, by which, however bad the mere painting, the likeness intended could always be seen at a glance if you knew how to look. “What was it, sir? we are impatient.” Why, he always painted on the frame of the picture the name of the person to whom the likeness or portrait belonged.[7] [7] In this request of ours I am well satisfied hundreds of bashful folks cordially unite; so that portrait-painters, if they have benevolent hearts, will adopt this ingenious expedient. But the chef-d'œuvre of Allheart was a full-length figure of the American Goddess, Liberty, done for the sign of the new hotel—the Woodville House. He was engaged at this picture, during the intervals stolen from his smithery, one whole summer: and many were the wondering visitors, from far and near, that favoured the artist with their company and remarks. For most matters here done in private were with us then done in public,—this of course being conducive to the perfection of the fine arts. And hence it is not surprising that Allheart, profiting by the endless remarks and suggestions of our democratical people, should have embodied all the best sentiment of the purest republicans in nature, and given to the Purchase the very beau ideal of American Liberty. I shall attempt no elaborate critique, but shall say enough to help intelligent readers to a fair conception of this piece The Goddess, like a courageous and independent divinity, stood, Juno fashion, right straight up and down the canvass, and with immoveable and fearless eyes fronted the spectator and looked exactly into his face; thus countenancing persecuted freemen, to the confusion of all tyrannical oppressors! Her face, in size and feature, was a model for wholesome Dutch milkmaids to copy after; but the cheeks, instead of blushing, were, I regret to say, only painted red, like those of an actress too highly rouged. In the right hand was a flag-staff, less indeed than a liberty-pole or Jackson-hickory, but considerably larger every way than a broom-handle; and on its top was hung, exactly in the centre, a cap—thus by its perfect balance and equi-distances of all parts of the rim from the staff, showing that liberty is justice, and is independent and impartial. The cap had, however, an ominous resemblance to one of Jack Ketch's; and no doubt foreign despots, ecclesiastical and secular, will pull said article over Liberty's eyes, if they succeed in apprehending and hanging her. On the left shoulder squatted a magnificent eagle in all the plenitude of stiff golden feathers, and in the act of being-a-going to drink from a good sized bowl held up by the left-hand fingers of the goddess. What was the mixture could not be seen—the bowl was so high—but most probably it was a sleeping-potion, as the bird seemed settled for a night's roost. Nay, this was the sentiment intended—to mark a time of profound peace, like shutting the gates of Janus: and hence the eagle held in his claws no arrowy thunder and lightning, being evidently disposed to let kings alone to take their naps, if they would let him alone to take his. The idea was equal in sublimity to Pindar's eagle snoozing on Jupiter's sceptre at the music of Orpheus; although my friend's bird was uncommonly big and heavy —but then his goddess was hale and hearty. The drapery or dress was a neat white muslin slip then fashionable in Kentucky, which was the Paris whence we derived fashions; and this simple attire was tied gently under the celestial bosom, which was heaved far up towards the chin, as if the heart was swollen with one endless and irrepressible emotion, and threatened some day or other to sunder the tie and burst right out, breast and all, through the frail barrier of the frock! Yet doubtless the slip was high in the back, and, a là Kaintuque, well secured between the shoulders, so that if things gave way in the front, there was still some support from behind—but then it looked dangerous. The frock was, however, undeniably starched and rather too short—(owing maybe to the upward heave of the bosom, as is the case sometimes with dresses from ill-made or too much tournure and bustle,)—for the article stood forth, not from the canvass but from the person, and all smooth and unwrinkled as if just from under the hot smoothing-iron! And, alas! its great brevity—(and the figure up so Vol. II.—3 high too)—revealed the sturdy ankles away up till they began to turn into limbs! The feet, unlike Liberty's martyrs in the Revolution, and to indicate our advance in comfort and security, and perhaps in compliment to a ladies' shoe-maker just established next the Woodville House, were covered with a pair of red morocco slippers; while on the ankles and upwards were drawn nice white stockings—so that there was no denudity of limb, as a lady-reader may have feared, and the fashionable frock was not so bad after all. Some error, perhaps, in foreshortening had happened as to the position of the feet, or rather the red moroccos; for, while the artist designed to represent the right foot as stepping from the other, and the left, as pointing the shoe-toe at the spectator immediately in front, yet the right shoe was fixed horizontally with its heel at a right angle with the other, and that other, the left hung perpendicularly down as if broken at the instep—a marvellous likeness to the two slippers on the shoe-maker's own sign, one there with its sole slap against the board, and the other up and down as if hung upon a peg. And oh! how I do wish I had not been born before the era of composition books!—or only now could take a few lessons with the author of one!—so as write with all the modern improvements, like the talented family of the Tailmaquers in the leading magazines and other picture books for grown up children!—I should so like to describe the putting up of our new tavern post, and the first hanging of the Goddess of Liberty! But that's not for the like of me— I'm no orator as Brutus. How can I paint the open-mouthed wonder of that crowd! How make you see the hunchings!—the winks!—the nods!—the pointings!—or hear the exclamations!—the queries!—the allowings!— the powerfuls!—the uproar? And when lawyer Insidias Cutswell, candidate for Congress, mounted the “hoss block” at the post, and ended his half-hour's speech—oh! I never! EXTRACT. “—Beautiful, indeed, fellow-citizens, vibrates above us in the free air and sunshine of Heaven, that picture! but more beautiful even is our own dear, blood-bought liberty! Long! long may her sign dance and rejoice there—(pointing up)—long, long may her image repose here—(slapping the chest and rather low)—and long, long, long live our enterprising townsman and fellow-citizen, who, untaught, has yet so ably embodied all that is substantial and solid, and upright and unflinching and stable in abstract, glorious, lovely liberty—our townsman, Allheart!” But “Non possumus omnia” must be our moral and conclusion. CHAPTER XXXVII. “His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops From caves of reeds.” Early this autumn, Aunt Kitty having after considerable unfixings got us fixed, returned to Glenville, whither we all at the same time paid a flying visit. At our arrival, we found true the report that John was defeated in his views on the clerkship by a majority against him of eleven; and that our ex-legislator had now leisure to collect the debts due Glenville &amp; Co.—debts increased by two political campaigns into “a puttee powerful smart little heap.” This business would have been altogether easy and pleasant, but for two small obstacles; most of our debtors who were very willing indeed to pay, had no visible pro perty; and the rest were even invisible themselves! For, pleased with the credit system in the Purchase, they had gone to try it elsewhere, and had become suddenly so unmindful of “the powerfullest smartest man and darndest cleverest feller in the county,” as to go away without one tender adieu! The fact is, our dear old friends had absquatulated, and gone away off somewhere to give other candidates a sort of a lift. But important changes almost destructive of Glenville Settlement, were now on the eve of accomplishment. Mr. Hilsbury had, his health being ruined, resigned his bishopric with all its emoluments, and was about returning to the far east; and Uncle Tommy from an irrepressible spirit of wandering, was just starting to go and build a cabin on Lake Michigan.[8] [8] If still there, somebody out there can make a book. And so, we had come in time to bid farewell! How melancholy the houses already, seemed so soon to be tenantless, and then so soon to moulder and fall into ruins;—a deserted cabin quickly changes, like a body left by the vital spark! Ah! how dreary the forest would be without friends! I had no spirits to hunt; although I wandered away and sat down on the bank of the creek opposite the little islet where the deer lay down to die—but without my rifle—it was to weep! Reader! if you have a soul you will not laugh at me;—and if you have none, then laugh away, poor creature, why should you not enjoy yourself your own way?—but dear reader with a soul, I after that went and sat down in the old bark-mill. And there I recalled the morning we stumbled down the opposite cliff into Uncle John's open arms—I saw the very spot where the mother had clasped the daughter to her bosom, and “lifted up her voice and wept”—and the sad spot too where that mother now rested in the lonely grave! I remembered the fresh revival of early dreams and visions realized in the novelty of a wild forest life!—ay! I recalled the oddity of my labours—and even that poor mute, but not wholly irrational companion!—and when I felt in my soul that changes had come and were yet coming, and that I never, no, never, could be in these woods as I had been— I even wept there, too, reader!—not loud indeed, but bitterly! In a few days we took a mournful farewell of the two families going from Glenville; and with no expectation of ever meeting again in this life. True, some of these persons, wanderers like ourselves, we did meet for a brief space in other parts of the United States again; but others we have never seen since the morning of our separation. And at this hour we know not where Uncle Tommy lives —or if dead, where his grave is! In this work, however, there will be no further mention of these two families. During the past summer Uncle John had been appointed a lay delegate from the Welden Diocese to attend an ecclesiastical convention about to meet early this fall at Vincennes; and he now, before our return to Woodville, obtained my promise to accompany him. Accordingly, a few days after our return, he, and with him Bishop Shrub, called on me, and we three set out for the Convention, or as all such gatherings are there called—the Big Meeting. The weather was luxurious, and the ride across the small prairies was to me, who now for the first time saw these natural meadows, indescribably bewitching; indeed, this first glimpse of the prairie world was like beholding an enchanted country! The enchanted land in that most transcendently enchanting book, the Pilgrim's Progress, came so naturally to one's mind, that surely Bunyan must have imagined a world like this meadowy land of wild and fragrant scents wafted by balmy airs from countless myriads of blossoms and flowers! Nothing is like the mellow light, as the sun sinks down far away behind the cloudless line of blended earth and sky—as if there one could, at a step, pass from the plane of this lower world through the hazy concave into the world of the ransomed! The bosoms of these grassy lakes undulate at the slightest breeze, and are sprinkled with picturesque islets of timber, on which the trees are fancifully and regularly disposed, suggesting an arrangement by the taste of an unrecorded people of bygone centuries for pleasure and religion. The whole brought back delusive dreams—we felt the strange and half-celestial thrill of a fairy scene! But pass we to a more earthly one. Eight miles from Vincennes we stopped at a friend's house to shave and preach; for among western folks a bishop is supposed to be made for preaching and we use him accordingly—and not infrequently we use him entirely up. The preaching was in due season easily performed, but the shaving, ah! there's the—scrape! Bishop Shrub was fortunately shaved close enough to last to Vincennes; not so Uncle John and myself. And when the old gentleman examined his saddle-bags, alas! alas! by an unaccountable negligence our razors and concomitants had been left at Woodville! But this forgetfulness was promptly supplied, I may add, and punished also by our host; for he offered his own razor—a curious cutting tool in a wooden handle nearly as large and quite as rough as a corn-cob! The bone handle, or make-believe-turtle one, had, in the course of ages, been worn away by the handling of grandsires and grandsons; and so had the edge itself by the ferocious stubble on the chins of woodsmen! Or perhaps it had been tritered away on a grindstone—the thing so much resembled a farmer's knife done up for hog-killing! Now Uncle John's countenance (?) was tender asa lamb's. Hence his razors were always in prime order; and when he and I shaved with his articles in company, he always insisted on the—first shave. But to-day, the excellent old gentleman most condescendingly gave me the precedence, internally resolving to watch my performance and success, and then to shave or not accordingly. Well, duly appreciating this unusual condescension, and thinking it a pity Uncle John should enter Vincennes with such a crop as his chin now held, we also secretly purposed—viz. to go through the whole affair without one audible or visible sign of torture! For certain was it, that if Mr. Carlton whose face was just as lamb-like as Mr. Seymour's, shaved without wincing, certain was it, Uncle John, long before my complete abrasion, would be so in the suds that, for consistency's sake, he must go through the whole scrape before he would get out it. Hence I strapped the oyster-knife, first on the instep of my boot, making there, however, an ominous scratch or two; then on the cover of a leaven-bit Testament done up in freckled leather; and finally, although very lightly, on the palm of my hand secundum artem: after which I made a feint at a hair, and then laid down the tormentor with so complacent compression of my lips as to say, that notwithstanding looks, the razor after all was “jeest” the very thing! Next, with a small bundle of swine's bristles tied in the middle with a waxed thread, I applied, out of a broken blue tea-cup, as much brown soap lather to my face as would stick; and then with a genuine far-east barber's flourish, touched the vile old briar-hook to my cheek, boldly and—lightly as possible. Reader! I did not swear in those days, but I could not avoid saying mentally—“O-o-oh! go-o-od! gramine!!”— and thinking of Job and the barrel of ale. Some profane wretches would have cursed right out as horribly as Pope Pius or Innocent, the vice-god damning and blackguarding a Calvinistic heretic; and for which malignancy the said Pope deserves to be scraped over his whole divine carcass twice a-day with the above razor, and without the alleviation of the brown soap. Happily for the success of my benevolent statagem I kept in; for at the moment I caught a glimpse of uncle John's face peeping over my shoulder into the tiny bit of looking-glass, and with his spectacles on! But if he did detect the involuntary tear in my eye, and take the alarm, he became instantly calm again by seeing the smile on my lip! Blood he discerned not; the tool was guiltless of all cutting, and brought away no beard save what it pulled out by the roots. Hence uncle John was most essentially bamboozled; and long before my beard was all plucked up, he had laid aside his coat and cravat, and according to custom and to soften his beard, he was lathering away with the hog bristles and brown soap. Had the old gentleman taken a peep now, he must have smelled the rat; for, spite of pain and tears, my laugh was too broad for mere delectability from a good shave—there was mischief and, I fear, some hypocrisy in the scarcely suppressed chuckle. However, being done, or scraped, I put down the eradicator with the air of one willing to shave all day with such a razor; upon which Uncle John advanced and took up the thing, manifesting, indeed, a little suspicion on glancing at its edge, and yet with very commendable confidence too; and then after the usual strappings and flourishings, he seized his nose with the left hand, and with the right laid the scraper sideways on a cheek, and essayed a rapid and oblique sweep towards his ear. Ah! me!—if I live a thousand more years, I shall ever be haunted by the dear old gentleman's look! Such a compound of surprise, and vexation, and pain, and fun, and humour! Such a “Carlton—you—rascal—you!—if I don't —never mind!” expression as met my view while I peeped over his shoulder into the fragment of glass against the wall! And then as he espied me therein grinning, when he turned, and with eyes swimming in tears, uttered in a whisper, and between a cry and a laugh, his favourite expression of benevolence and amazement—“Oh!—cry!— out!” Yes! yes! if one could have cried out, or even laughed out! But there was our host and all his family; and the father kept on at very judicious intervals with praise of that razor, thus:—“Powerful razor that, Mr. Carlton! Grandaddy used to say he'd shaved with it when he was young, Mr. Seymour! and his face was near on about as saft as yourn I allow. However its getting oldish now, and don't cut near as sharpish as it once did—allow it wants grinding: still I wouldn't give it for are another two I ever seen.” Could one dare venture to complain about such a razor? against which no dog had even wagged a tongue or a tail for a hundred years! So we cried in and laughed in then —but when we got out of sight and hearing in the prairie! Nobody, I fear, would have conjectured we were going to the big meeting. Poor dear, old Uncle John! I am laughing even now at thy beloved face in that most furious lather of brown soap! and with that grand swathe cut through towards thy ear by that venerable briar-hook!—ay! and at that concentration of kindness, surprise, and joke-taking embodied in—“Oh! cry out!” “But, la! me! Mr. Carlton, where's the moral of this story?” My dear madam, some stories have no moral; but the design is to warn you never to travel in new settlements if your face is tender without your own shaving apparatus. “For shame!—ladies never shave.” Oh! my!—the sentence is carelessly constructed; but none can say where beards may not grow next. Certainly 3* they are now found, if not on girls' chins, yet on very girlish faces. And agriculture of all kinds is now better understood, and the most unpromising soils produce the most astonishing crops: and besides, we are evidently in the Hairy Age, and tobacco is puffed and spurted from hairy lips like black mud from a quagmire — “Sir! this is offensive!” Very; therefore let us quit it. CHAPTER XXXVIII. “When holy and devout religious men Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence.” “Love and meckness, lord, Become a churchman better than ambition.” On reaching Vincennes our party, as others, were quartered upon the citizens; and such kindness as belongs preeminently to the West and South was bestowed upon us during the week of the convocation. Vincennes has been the scene of many meetings, civil, political, ecclesiastical, and military; to say nothing about Frenchified-Indian-councils and Indianised-French-dances, and other odd things produced by this amalgamation of the red and white savages. But now it was the theatre of two remarkable exhibitions,—the gathering of a Protestant council, and the erection of a Papistical cathedral!—strange meeting of light and darkness. And both professed to be for the propagation of the religion of Jesus Christ. Now, whether the simple shining of truth in the reading and preaching of a vernacular Bible, and in the good lives and examples of puritanic Christians, and without aid from the civil arm, and without a base indulgence of men's evil passions and propensities, shall be more potent than a tradition, dark, bewildering, and uncertain, delivered by doctors and professors of the faggot and the thumb-screw, admits a question; but, judging from the success that has always attended the affectionate embraces of the old woman with the scarlet mantle, and especially when seated amid “the wimples and crisping-pins,” the roasters, and boilers, and toasters of the Inquisition,—from the efficacy of sweet doses and sugared cups and intoxicating bowls of indulgences granted to the saints and holy ones, it is more than likely that the great crowd of such as “love darkness” and “the wages of unrighteousness,” and “prefer the pleasures of sin for a season,” will—(and are not such the ?? ??????) will become militant, and on earth triumphant members of the Holy (?) Catholic (??) Church (???) In vain, while looking at the sacred walls of the cathedral rising brick by brick, did I severely chide my antagonist feelings as heretical pravity; in vain recall the oft-repeated remark, that we were in the nineteenth century, the age of courtesy, and charity, and light, and wisdom, and oh! of ever so many first chop good things beside; in vain remember that human nature had been gradually refining ever since the days of Judas Iscariot, till it was now ten per cent. per annum better and more spiritual and heavenly-minded; yea, poor sinner that I was, in vain I said this is the march of mind, and that I was, poor sneaking doubter, in danger of falling into the rear of my age! Nothing would do—but my historic readings kept intruding in the most impertinent and unbecoming manner; and I was abominably harassed with the fables of the Vaudois—and Huguenots—and Jerome—and Huss—and St. Bartholomew's, and Irish, and other massacres, and all such ridiculous things! Nay, I was plunged most unreasonably into nasty dungeons, and saw racks, and halters, and augurs,—and, silly creature, I imagined an auto da fe! and heard shouts and groans! and smelled incense, faggots and gunpowder! and even Te Deums for the death of ungodly heretics wickedly killed by the state, contrary to the entreaties of the Holy Church! Alas! reprobate that I was, for reading books proscribed by that Church!—and all those books got up by folks worthy of no credit—enemies of the Church and of the Pope,—and who would wickedly tell when they were tortured, and refused to be damned for ever by escaping from prison, gibbets and stakes! And then I said, Oh! you unreasonable man, has not the Holy Catholic Church long since given up her bloody persecuting principles, and resolved never to do so again, if we will only take on her yoke—until she gets the power? Alas! I thought of political mottos used as ornaments[9] [9] Ornaments—since most such papers watch only their Protestant friends who do not need it. to secular newspapers, such as “Power steals from the many to the few;” and of that narrow, bigotted puritanical sentiment, “The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked;” and so I turned to contemplate THE PROTESTANT CONVOCATION. And I could not but feel grateful to the rightful Head of the spiritual Church, that here was a little band hated of Rome and Oxford. For with the men of this conference the true light had travelled thus far westward, and we hoped it might shine out far and wide over the noble plains, and dispel the gloom of the grand forests—since the march of the mind is only an evil without the march of the Bible. This Protestant assembly was a gathering of delegates principally from the land of Hoosiers and Suckers; but with a smart sprinkling of Corn-crackers, and a small chance of Pukes from beyond the father of floods, and even one or two from the Buckeye country. These were not all eminent for learning, and polish, and dress, wearing neither gowns nor cocked-hats; although some there were worthy seats in the most august assemblies any where, and however distinguished for wit, learning, and goodness. Most of them, indeed, carried to excess a somewhat false and dangerous maxim: “better wear out than rust out,”—since it is better to do neither. And worn truly were they, both in apparel and body, as they entered the town on jaded horses, after many days of hard and dangerous travelling away from their cabin-homes, left far behind in dim woods beyond rivers, hills and prairies. And what came they together for? Mainly, I believe, to preach, to pray, to tell about their successes and disappointments and encouragements—their hopes, and fears, and sorrows—to rectify past errors, and form better plans of doing good for the future—to see, and encourage, and strengthen one another. Business, in the semi-politico-ecclesiastical sense, they did little—for of that was but little to do. And there were few causes of heart burning and jealousy. No richly endowed professorships, no a là mode congregations were found in all their vast extent of diocesses— no world's treasures or places to tempt to divide, to sour! Truly it was a House of Bishops, if not of Lords: if by a bishop is meant one that has the care of many congregations, an enormous parish, abundant religious labours, and a salary of one or two hundred dollars above nothing. In the midst of so fraternal and cheerful a band of misters and brothers, I was constantly reminded of an old saying; “Behold! how these Christians love one another!” What could exceed their cordial and reciprocal greetings at each arrival? What their courtesy in debate? What the deep interest in each other's welfare?—the lively emotions excited by their religious narratives and anecdotes? And then their tender farewells! To many the separation was final as to this life—but why should that make us sad? They who find heaven begun on earth, meet beyond the grave, and there find heaven consummated! Brother Shrub and myself were entertained, during the convention week, at the house of a medical gentleman, eminent in his profession, but addicted, it was said, to profanity in ordinary conversation. Without a premonition, no suspicion of so blameworthy a practice could have arisen in our minds; for no real Christian ever showed guests greater courtesy, or seemed so far from profaneness than our gentlemanly host. He did not even annoy us with lady-like mincings, putting forth the buddings of profanity in “la! me!—good gracious!” and the like. But on Sabbath night, our conversation taking a religious turn, the subject of profane swearing was incidentally named, when I could not resist the temptation of drawing a bow at a venture; and so I said: “Doctor, we leave you to-morrow; and be assured we are very grateful to Mrs. D. and yourself; but may I say dear sir, we have been disappointed here?” “Disappointed!” “Yes, sir, but most agreeably —” “In what, Mr. Carlton?” “Will you pardon me, if I say we were misinformed, and may I name it?” “Certainly, sir, say what you wish.” “Well, my dear sir, we were told that Doctor D. was not guarded in his language—but surely you are misrepresented —” “Sir,” interrupted he, “I do honour you for candour; yet, sir, I regret to say, you have not been misinformed. I do, and, perhaps, habitually use profane language; but, sir, can you think I would swear before religious people, and one of them a clergyman?” Tears stood in my eyes (the frank-heartedness of a gentleman always starts them) as I took his hand, and replied: “My dear sir, you amaze us! Can it be that Doctor D., so courteous and so intelligent a man, has greater reverence for us than for the venerable God!” “Gentlemen,” replied the Doctor, and with a tremulous voice, “I never did before see the utter folly of profane swearing. I will abandon it for ever.” Reader, are you profane? Imitate the manly recantation of my estimable friend, Doctor D. “To Swear—is neither brave, polite, nor wise: You would not swear upon the bed of death— Reflect—your Maker now could stop your breath!” During the week, in company with some clergymen, we visited the grave of a young man, who, unavoidably exposed to a fatal illness in discharging his missionary duties, had died at Vincennes in early manhood, and far away from his widow-mother's home. Deep solemnity was in the little company of his classmates as they stood gazing where rested the remains of the youthful hero! Dear young man, his warfare was soon ended—and there he lay among the silent ones in the scented meadow-land of the far west! He heard not the voice of the wind, whether it breathed rich with the fragrance of wild sweets, or roared around in the awful tones of the hurricane, sweeping over the vastness of the measureless plains! Nor heard he the sighs of his comrades—nor saw their sudden tears wiped away with the stealthy motion of a rapid hand! To him that visit was vain; not so to us, for we departed, resolved ourselves to be ready for an early death. And since then several of that little company of mourners in a strange land have themselves, and before the meridian of life, gone down to the sides of the pit! Are you ready, my reader? Time is a price to buy eternity! CHAPTER XXXIX. “Tree! why hast thou doffed thy mantle of green For the gorgeous garb of an Indian queen? With the umbered brown and the crimson stain And the yellow fringe on its 'broidered train? And the autumn gale through its branches sighed Of a long arrear, for the transient pride.” Sigourney. Uncle John and I, being now very near Illinois, where resided a distant relative of ours, determined to pay him a visit. This person was much like uncle Tommy in his leather-stocking propensities, but in no other respects; except that he was, at first, a squatter, and had escaped on some occasions, being scalped by the Indians. Once, too, he escaped an ambuscade as he descended the Ohio river with several other young men in a boat. Incautiously approaching too near the bank, our relative was saved from death by being in the act of bending to his oar at the flash of the Indian rifles; for their balls, barely passing over his back, struck the breast of a comrade, who fell dead at his side. But, before the enemy could reload, the boat was rowed beyond their reach. And so our friend lived, and ever since had kept on growing till he now had become a venerable and patriarchal Sucker, counting some sixty-five concentric circles in his earthly vegetation. Our way led through successive and beautiful little prairies, separated by rich bottom lands of heavy timber and other interposing woody districts—the trees being all magnificently glorious in the autumnal colours of their dense foliage. No artificial dyes rival the scarlet, the crimson, the orange, the brown, of the sylvan dresses—giant robes and scarfs, hung with indescribable grandeur and grace, over the rough arms and rude trunks of the forest! And voices enough of bird, and beast, and insect, and reptile, rose at our approach from the bosom of the wavy grass, to break the solitude of the treeless plains; but, on entering a district of wood, the uproar of tones, voices, shrieks, hisses, barkings, and a hundred other nameless cries, was deafening! It was bewildering! How like the enchanted hills and groves of the Arabian Tales! Indeed, had a penalty awaited our looking around, we should have become stone, or stump, or paroquet, or squirrel, a thousand times over and over, much to our surprise and mortification! The bewildering tumult assailing him, on entering the solemn dark of primitive oriental forests, must have suggested to the Magician of the Thousand and One Nights, some of the charms and witcheries and incantations that entranced our first years of boyhood and dreams! To the elfish notes of four-footed and creeping goblins and winged and gay sprites, were added the rustle of fresh fallen leaves, the crackling of brush-wood, the rattling of branch and bush, the strange creaking of great trees, rubbing in amity their arms and boughs, and the wailing and moaning of fitful winds; and this formed our sinless Babel. Under the most favourable arrangement of lungs, and larynx and ears, conversation is a labour in such groves and meadows; but, ah! my dear friend, if one's comrade is deaf! or still worse if he is a modest man of the muttery and whispery genus! and hearing uncommonly sharp himself, takes for granted you hear ditto! True, if you like to do talking, and the other hearing, that is the very thing; but alas! our escort in this episodial trip, who was a Mr. Mealymouth, was even more desirous of talking than hearing! And what made it more awful, it was not possible to answer him in the “Amen-at-a-venture” mode; for most of Mr. Mealymouth's queries, which were numerous as a pedlar's from the land of guesses, admitted not the mere answer yes or no, but demanded explanatory replies like those of Professor Didactic. He asked to find out what you knew, and not to be answered. Uncle John quickly contrived to shuffle out of this scrape, and with a most unchristian design to take revenge for the razor affair; but then he ought not to have paid back with so terrible an interest. Nay, he lagged just in our rear, every now and then switching my creature, till the huzzy— (a lady horse)—feared to quit the side of the escort's horse —(a horse-horse)—and so kept on even a head with him, pace for pace, trot for trot, shuffle for shuffle; her eyes strained backward, her ears pointed and tremulous, and her heels in the panlo-ante-future tense of being-nearly-about-a-going-to-kick;—while I, completely snared and in-for-it, could be seen, all eye and ear, with my neck away out forward to catch the sense of Mr. Mealymouth muttering and whispering some half-articulate question direct or indirect, thus: “Well—Carlt—powerful—don't—allow?” “Si-i-i-r?” at the top of my voice to provoke him to a higher pitch. “Most powerful good meet—reckon—dont—?” “Oh! yes, rather lean, however,—it wasn't stall fed— think it was?”—(I thought he alluded to the beefsteak at breakfast.) “Meetin—meetin—convoc—hard heerin—allow?” “The leaves rattle so—oh! yes, noble set of good men.” “Mr. Carlton—allow—Mr. Seymour—ain't he?” “Yes!—no!” And turning round I bellowed out;— “Hullow! Uncle John, ride up, Mr. Mealymouth wants you!” “Road too narrow—'fraid of things getting rubbed in my saddle-bags,”—replied Uncle J. Here I politely made a movement to fall in the rear and give up my privilege; but my skittish jade, catching sight of Uncle John's upraised switch, snorted, and cocking back her ears trotted me up again to the place of punishment— while from Uncle John's face, it was plain enough he was indulging in a malicious inward laugh. Nay, although I hate to tell it, he actually put up his finger against his cheek and made signs of shaving!—a pretty way for a pious man of returning good for evil! I shall not detail all my misapprehensions nor contrivances to avoid answering at hazard, as for instance, suddenly crying out, when expected to reply to a query— “See! see! that deer!”—or—“Hurraw! for the turkeys there!”—or—“Smell cowcumbers—guess a rattlesnake's near?” Nor shall I relate how, at last, I did get behind Uncle John; and how Mr. M. fell back and rode with him; I ever and anon admonishing Mr. Seymour to take care of his saddle-bags;—nor how Uncle John was attacked with a very uncommon and alarming stiffness, rendering it necessary for him to dismount and walk a whole mile; and how he over took us at the ford of the Wabash, Mr. M. fortunately volunteering to lead his horse; but I hasten to say that about evening we reached the house of a friend who had invited us to call on him, and that here, to crown the pleasures of the day, we found our host Mr. Softspeech was even more inarticulate in speech than Mr. Mealymouth himself. Uncle John now proposed to bury the hatchet, and form a league of offence and defence; hence, after due deliberation while out washing and wiping, it was concluded that we both sit together, and always in front of the fire; thus keeping our innocent tormentors each at opposite sides of the chimney place. For first, this would do them a service by compelling them to talk out, it seeming impossible, if they designed speaking to one another at all, to do it long in a mutter; and secondly, if we were assailed by either enemy right or left, we should have four ears to defend and aid us, instead of two, and so we could together compound a pretty fair answer:—this judicious arrangement made us nearly equal to a Siamese twins. And yet, one important matter was found to have been overlooked—the effect on our risibility. For when the two cousins of Simongosoftly began a gentle stir of murmuring lips, and both found, in despite of keen ears, that articulate language must be used; and when evident vexation from their reciprocal mutters and mistakes arose, and they looked at one another in a style like saying, “Blast you, why don't you speak louder”—Oh! dear reader, would you have believed it. Uncle John all at once laughed right out!—and then you know I couldn't help it—could I? But then, the old gentleman turned it so adroitly, thus: “Mr. Carlton,”—said he—“whenever I think of that trick you served me about the razor I can't help laughing.” And of course that affair was narrated; and we had the satisfaction of finding our two friends could laugh like Christians, if they could not talk like them. And truly man is pretty much of a laughing animal—and certainly none deserves to be more laughed at; although for this vile sin of muttering, and grumbling, and whispering out words with a fixed jaw, and eyes half-shut up like a dreamy cat in the sunshine, words, that should be articulated in the sweet vocality of human speech, the whole abominable tribe of Mealymouths deserves not only to be laughed and hooted at, but actually well scourged. Well, we paid our visit to our Sucker relative; and then, after the two worthy old gentlemen had exhausted their reminiscences, and edified one another with adventures in hunting, and fishing, and camping out, and voyaging, and so on, we bade farewells; and Uncle John and myself, but without an escort, took the homeward trail. The accidents in the path belong to the next chapter. CHAPTER XL. “Being skilled in these parts, which, to a stranger Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and inhospitable.” On the return, our first night was passed with the host of the antediluvian razor. But going into the woods we needed now no shaving; although we shortly became entangled in another scrape, to be estimated in comparison and contrast, according to the tenderness of one's face, and his leggins and trousers. Let me not forget that, before reaching Razorville, we had passed through a primitive world, an antique French settlement; and in it could be discerned no trace of modern arts and inventions; but agriculture, architecture and other matters were so ancient that we seemed to have come among aboriginal Egyptians or Greeks. The carts or wagons were like the wain of Ceres, and moved on spokeless wheels of solid wood, without naves, and, if circumsference applied to wheels must be a circle, without circumference. The horse—if such may be called a dwarf, shaggy pony, so dirty and earthy as to seem raised in a crop, like turnips or potatoes—this villanous and cunning horse was tied to the Cerealian vehicle by thongs of elm bark, fastened to a collar of corn blades around his neck; and he had a head-gear of elm bark ropes for halter or bridle—but sometimes he had no head-gear whatever. He was driven usually by flagellation from a stick-whip, in size between a switch and a pole, yet often with a corn-stalk fourteen feet long without its tassel, and, not infrequently, by a clod or rock[10] [10] All minute pieces of granite, &amp;c., are called rocks out there— but even little things there are big. thrown against his head or side. At the first hint from the persuasives, shaggy coat would merely shake his head and look up, and then, with an impudent flourish of a tail compounded of burs and horse-hair, he would pull away—not, indeed, at his load—but at the corn-blades and ears dangling in plenty about his unmuzzled mouth. On a repetition of the hint, especially if accompanied by a Canadianised-French execration—(and its potency may be thus judged)—pony would whisk with his cart some half-dozen decided jerks, attended by the rattling of his corn-collar, the straining of bark traces, and the screeching of dry wheel and axis; minus also a mess of corn bounced from the wain at every jerk. And thus matters proceeded, with iterations of thumps, pelts, curses, and outcries on one side, and jerks ahead on the other, till the horse and wagon was clear of the corn-field—and then look out! Pony had now no more to expect in the way of mouthfuls till he reached the stack-yard, and so, go ahead was his motto—and, with him, no idle sentiment! True, the machine wabbled and bounced—that was owing to the inartificiality of the workmanship, and the asperities of the ground; the load jumped over the sides or rattled from the tail—that was because the sides were too low, and there was no tail-board; perhaps, even the collar broke, and little shaggy was released—the collar should have been leather: his duty was plain—to get to the stack-yard as speedily as possible, with or without a cart, or with it full or empty. How my nameless quadrupedal old friend would have relished and adorned this areadian life! What a theatre for his abilities and accomplishments! It may be something to live in clover; but what is life in a clover-patch of a dozen rods, to life in a prairie corn-field of a thousand acres? But this is digression, of which, indeed, other examples occurred on our way home. A friend of ours, a citizen of Woodville, returning now from Vincennes, and who travelled in a small one-horse-wagon, had told us of a short cut across the prairie; and had stated also that, while the path was an almost imperceptible trace, being used only by a few horsemen, still we should easily follow the marks of his wheels—and thus a whole hour could be gained. Passing us, therefore, on the evening we had reached Razorville, he went by the short cut to “ole man Stafford's,” a distance of seven miles, intending there to stay all night and await our arrival to a very early breakfast next morning,—the remainder of the journey to be made in company. Well, an hour before day-break on Tuesday morning we put out, and in half an hour came to the “blind path,” into which we struck bold enough, considering we had to dismount to find it, and that from the dimness of the early morn, no wagon ruts could yet be discerned. But as the light increased, we could see here and there in the grass traces of a light wagon; and that emboldened us to trot on very fast, in the comfortable assurance of rapidly approaching a snug breakfast of chicken fixins, eggs, ham-doins, and corn slap-jacks. By degrees the prairie turned into timber land; but that had been expected, although the woods were rather more like thickets and swamps than ought to be encountered on entering the Stafford country. Still, every two or three rods was some mark of our friend's wagon; and as short cuts often pass through out-of-the-way districts, and we travelled now not by stars, or sun, or compass, but by wheel-ruts, we deemed it best to stick to our guide and Uncle John's old saw—“'tis a long lane that has no turn.” At last we came to the edge of a dense and dark thicket; and here, at right angles with the ruts, (for long since the six-inch horse-path had run out, or sunk, or evaporated, or something,) ran a deep and wide gulley blocked with fallen trees and brushwood; over which of course the wagon had got somehow, and, as was natural, without leaving any visible trace. This deficiency was, however, not important, because, you know, we should find the wagon tracks on the far side of the ravine; and so over we went working, where the impediments seemed fewest, in a zig-zag method, for about two hundred yards, when all at once we rose, large as life, up the opposite bank, and instantly began talking:— “See any ruts?” “No,—do you?” “No,—let's ride to the left.” “Through that papaw and spice!—no, no, try the right.” “The right!—look at the grape and green briar—better keep straight ahead.” “Straight ahead, indeed!—that's worse than the other courses.” “Why, how in the name of common sense did Mr. Thorn ever get his wagon through here!—come, you go right and I'll go left, and let's see if we can't find the wheel-ruts.” And then we separated; but after hard “scrouging” each way some hundred yards, and halloing questions, answers, doubts, guesses, &amp;c., &amp;c., in a very unmealy-mouthed manner, till we became hoarse, and withal finding no ruts, nor even hoof-marks, we came together and held a council. The result of the deliberation was: 1. That we were probably—(Uncle J. being a woodsman would allow only a probability)—were probably lost: 2. That maybe we might have followed a wrong wagon, and maybe we might not: 3. That maybe we had better go back, and maybe we had not: 4. That as it was likely we had been spirited into the Great Thicket of the White River, it would be best to work ahead, and strike the river itself now, up or down which (I forget which Uncle J. said) was a settlement maybe. This last proposition having a decided majority of two voices, we began to work our passage into the river, Mr. Seymour as general in the van, Mr. C. as rear-guard. Now how shall our swamp be described? What language can here be an echo to the sense? Any attempt of the sort would be so complicated an implexicity in the interwovenness of the circularity, that should give the sight, and sound, and fragrance of the maziness in that most amazing of mazes, where all sorts of crookednesses made contortion worse in its interlacings, that—that—one would go first this way, and then some other way, and then back again once more towards the end, side, middle and beginning of the sentence, and yet fail to discover the—the— echo,—and be no more able to get through with so labyrinthical unperiodical a period, in any other way than we were to get out of the thicket, and that was by bursting out—so! However, you've picked black-berries?—gone after chicken-grapes or something, in your early days? You've set snares in pretty thick thickets, where you went on all-fours through prickle-bushes to save your face? Well— aggregate the trifling impediments of your worst entanglements; then colour matters a little, and you approximate a just conception of our thicket. In this, all sorts of trees, bushes, briars, thorns, and creepers, the very instant their seeds were dropped or roots set by nature,—and some without staying for either root or seed,—started right up and off all at once a growing with all their might, each and Vol. II.—4 every struggling, like all creation for the ascendancy, and thus preventing one another and all others from getting too large; yea, in haste and eagerness, like candidates climbing a hickory-pole, all wrapping, and interlacing, and interweaving trunks, boughs, branches, arms, roots and shoots, till no eye could tell whether, for instance, the creeper produced the thorn, or the thorn the creeper, or the vine the scrub-oak, or the oak the grapes—and till the shaking, or pulling, or touching, of a single branch, vine, root, or briar shook a thousand!—ay! like the casting of a pebble into a lake, till it disturbed in some degree the whole immensity of the thicket! And so all, in sheer rage, malice, and vexation, sent forth all manners, kinds and sorts of prickers and scratchers, and thorns, and scarifiers; and began to bear all manners and kinds and sorts of flowers, and poisonous berries, and grapes! In places, a black walnut, or hackberry, or sycamore, having, like a Pelagian, an intrinsic virtue had got the start of nature by a few hours at the beginning of the swamp; and had ever since kept a head so elevated as now to be overlooking miles around of the mazy world below, and presenting a trunk and boughs so wrapped in vines and parasites as to form a thicket within a thicket, an imperium in imperio; while coiled and wreathed there into fantastic twistings, immense serpentine grape vines seemed like boas and anacondas, ready to enfold and crush their victims! Nay, in every labyrinth were concealed worlds of insects, reptiles, and winged creatures; and some, judging from their hisses, and growls, and mutterings, as they darted from one concealment to another at the strange invasion of their dens and lairs, were doubtless formidable in aspect, and not innoxious in bites and stings. Through this apparently impervious wilderness of the woven world twist, however, we did—onward, as Uncle John said. I thought it was a vain struggle, like striving to free one's self from the meshes of a giant's net! Yet I kept close in the rear of his horse; for Mr. Seymour insisted on being pilot, and politeness yields to elders even in wriggling through a swamp. But what need be told our contrivances to work through? Never in words can be painted the drawing up of our legs!—the shrinking of our bodies!—the condensation of our arms!—the bowings down of our heads, with compressed lips and shut eyes! But still we talked thus: “Oh! hullow! stop, won't you?” “What's the matter?” “My hat's gone.” “There it is, dangling on that branch—look up—higher! —higher yet!” “Oh! yes—I see:—lucky the hat wasn't tied under a fellow's chin, hey?—how the thing jerked!” “Ouch!—what a scratch!—just get out your knife and cut this green-briar.” “I've cut it—go on:—look out, you'll lose your right leggin.” “Whi-i-i-rr!—what's that?” “A pheasant!” “H-i-i-ss!—what's that?” “A snake!” “Haw! haw! haw!—if your trousers aint torn the prettiest!” “Don't taste them!—they aint grapes!—they are poison berries!” “Look—quick!—what an enormous lizard!” And then such knocks on the head! Did I ever think heads, before the aid of phrenology, could bear such whacks! Soft heads, surely, must have been mashed, and hard ones, cracked; and, therefore, Uncle John and I had medium sculls, and the precise developments to go through thickets. I had always disbelieved the vulgar saying about “knocked into a cocked hat,”—deeming it, indeed, possible to be knocked out of one; but my infidelity left me in that swamp, when I saw the very odd figures we made after our squeezings, abrasions, and denudings. The shape of a cocked hat was not at all like them! and yet, in about three hours from the starting at the gulley, we somehow or other stood on the summit of a bold bluff, and beheld the river coolly and beautifully flowing beneath our feet away below! Here we halted, first to repair apparel, wipe off perspiration, and pick out briars and thorns from the hands and other half-denuded parts; and, secondly, to determine the next movement, when—hark! the sound of an axe!—yes! and hark!—of human voices! Between us and the sounds, evidently not more than two hundred yards up the river, interposed a dense and thorny rampart; but with coats fresh buttoned to our throats, hats half-way over the face, and leggins rebound above the knee and at the ankle, we, in the saddles, and retired within ourselves, like snails, the outer man being thus contracted into the smallest possible dimension, and with heads so inclined as to render following the nose alike impossible and useless, we charged with the vengeance of living battering rams against and into the matted wall of sharp and sour vegetables; and onward, onward, went we thus, till all at once, the impediment ceasing, we burst and tumbled through into an open circular clearing of about fifty yards diameter! In one part was a rude shantee or temporary lodge of poles and bark, a la Indian, having in front, as cover to a door-way, a suspended blanket, perhaps to keep out mosquitoes; for I could neither see nor imagine any other use. On one side the area, were large heaps of hoop-poles, on another, of barrel-staves; while in several places stood gazing at us three squatter-like personages, and evidently not gratified at our unceremonious visit. The nature of their employment was manifest—the preparation of some western “notions and ideas” for the Orleans market. And down the bluff was a grand fleet of flat boats, ready to float whenever the water chose to come up to them, and convey to market a whole forest, in the shape of hoop-poles, staves, and other raw material, not only now being prepared, but which had been being prepared and was yet to be being pre-prepared in all the fashionable modern tenses! “Well, what of that?” Nothing; it was very correct, except in one small particular, although not a grammatical one; this snug little swamp and thicket, some thirty miles by two in extent, and full of choice timber, happened to belong to our Great Father's elder brother, the venerable dear good old Uncle Sam! And these reprobate nephews, our cousins, were simply busy in taking more than their share of the common heritage—in short, they were poaching and stealing! Now, kind reader, for the last three hours, we had passed through a considerable scrape; nay, as we had shrunk up, it may be called a narrow scrape, but on comprehending the present affair, it seemed not improbable that we had only come out of the scrape literal, into the scrape metaphorical. “How so?” Why you see, a large penalty was incurred for cutting down and stealing public timber; and the informer got a handsome share of the fine as reward; so that our industrious kinsmen taking us, at first, for spies and informers, not only looked, but talked quite growly; and we both felt a little nervous at sight of the rifles and scalping knives in the shantee! Here is a first-rate temptation to make a thrilling story; but I must not forget the dignity of history —(although Uncle John and I both thrilled at the time without any story)—and so I proceed to say, that we soon satisfied our free traders who we were; and that they condescended not only to laugh, but to sneer at us, and then pointed to a nice little wagon that one of them had driven yesterday from near Razorville, with their supplies for the current week! And that was the identical rut-making machine, that, so contrary to every body's wishes had coaxed us into the thicket! We were then taught how to return on its trace, by a kind of opening through the maze; and received ample directions where and how to cross the ravine. We accordingly hastened away; but we never felt perfectly easy, or ventured to laugh honestly, till full two hundred yards beyond the longest rifle shot, which might very accidentally take our direction, and, may be, hit us. The path over the ravine was, indeed, less tangled, where the wagon had passed; yet it was a quarter of a mile above our crossing place, and concealment had evidently been studied in the way the stave-maker's vehicle had put off, even at an acute angle, at the point where we had lost its trail; and in the windings we had to thread among the high grass before we again reached that point. After having thus lost a wagon in a prairie, I felt inclined to believe in the difficulty of finding a needle in a hay-stack. But we came, finally, to a deserted cabin; and there, after a keen look, discovered a little path laid down for us in the late verbal chart. Here, confident from experience, that this rabbit track of a road, some two inches wide was yet one of fifty similar ones leading to the grand trace, path, or way, we struck off at a rapid gait; and in an hour came to the open wagon road, which we knew conducted to Mr. Stafford's Public. Revived we now cantered on, and not long after reached our breakfast-house, just as the sun was going down—having in the day's navigation with all our tackings made precisely seven miles, by the short cut, in the homeward direction. Since Monday night, we had eaten nothing, and were naturally ready now for three meals in one; and yet were we destined to wait a little longer, and condense into one four repasts—like ancient Persians when hunting. For, either not liking our appearance, or vexed at our not having come earlier to breakfast, we were here most pertinaciously refused any entertainment whatever, and even peremptorily ordered away; and were, indeed, compelled to put off for the nearest house, some eight miles farther at the ferry! Half a mile from Stafford's, we met a young fellow, evidently in an ill humour at something, who did, verily, condescend to direct us how to steer through a sea of grass, rolling its waves over the prairie's bosom in the haze of the approaching night; but whether the rascal sent us wrong purposely, or we had so practiced getting lost as to render the thing easy, after seeming to come duly to expected points, in about six miles we could find no more points, and so began again travelling at a venture; and at ten o'clock at night, it being then profoundly dark, we resigned our reason to the horses' instinct to take us where they listed. We knew the creatures would follow some path and carry us, some time or other, to a human habitation, if that of a poacher or squatter; and any thing seemed then preferable to the wilds of the prairie! In about two hours my horse, now in the lead, suddenly halted, when dismounting, I tried first with my feet, and then my hands, and quickly had by these new senses a feeling sense of our situation, viz. that we stood at the diverging point of two paths running from one another at nearly a right angle! “Well, what do you say—which shall we take?” “Hem!—what do you say? Don't it seem damp towards the right?” “I think it does—and maybe the river is that way, Don't it seem like rising ground towards the left, to you?” “It does—let's try the left—we've had enough of thickets for one day—hark! hark!!” “Bow-wow-wow! bow-wow!” on the left. “Sure enough! a dog towards the left! push a-head that way.” The canine outcry was reduplicated and prolonged; and we were soon rewarded for our sagacity in going to the left by coming whack up against a worm-fence! But groping our way through this impediment, a light was soon discerned gleaming through some crevice; and the noise of the dog then subsided into an angry growl—which growl was again exchanged into a bark, as we let out our hearty and door penetrating “Hullow!” This backwood's sonnet had soon the desired effect on the clap-board shutter; for it now creaked slowly open, and allowed to issue from the cabin the following reply in a strong soprano, yet vibratory from apprehension— “Well—who be you? what's a wantin?” “Strangers, ma'am, from the Big Meeting at Vincennes; we've been lost all day in the Swamp below Stafford's— and we're lost now. Will you be so kind as to let us stay the rest of the night here?” “Well, it's most powerful onconvenent—couldn't you a sort a keep on to Fairplay—'taint more nor two miles no how, and you'd git mighty good 'comedashins thar?” “Oh! ma'am, we'd never find the way in the dark. Besides, our horses are nearly given out; and we ourselves haven't touched food for nearly two days—” “Well! now! if that aint amost too powerful hard like! —I'm a poor lone woman body—but I can't let you go on —so come in. But, strangers, you'll find things right down poor here, and have to sleep on the floor, as 'cos I've no more nor two beds and them's all tuk up by me and the childurn. Howsever, thar's a corn heap over thar to feed your critturs; but we're now teetotally out of meal;—and Bill's to start in the morning for a grist—and I'm powerful sorry we've nothin to eat—” “Oh! thank you, ma'am—never mind us—thank you— never mind! If we get corn for our poor brutes, and shelter for ourselves that will do—thank you, ma'am—never mind!” Having fed our jaded animals we entered the cabin, and depositing our saddles and furniture in one corner, we sat down on two rude stools, like some modern ottomans in the city; being so low as to force one's knees and chins into near proximity. They had, indeed, no covering or cushion, unless such be considered the lone woman's indescribable, lying on the one, and Bill's tow-linen breeches on the other—articles we considerately, however, removed for fear of soiling. The next thing we did was to poke up the slumbering fire; by the light of which we first cast rueful looks on one another, and then some sideway glances around the apartment. In one spot, stood a barrel with an empty bag of dim whiteness, hanging partly in and partly out, while across its top was laid a kneading bowl, and in that a small washing machine;—the barrel being manifestly the repository of meal, and the bag the very affair Bill was to ride, in the morning, to mill. Near us was a shelf holding a few utensils for mush and milk, several tin cups, a wooden bowl in need of scouring, and some calabashes; a large calabash we had noticed outside the door, having a small grape vine for a handle, and intended to represent a bucket for water and other wet and dry uses. In a strap of deer-skin nailed under the shelf were stuck certain knives, some ornamented with buck-horn handles, one or two with corn-cob handles, and one handleless; and interspersed judiciously in the same strap were pincushions, scissors, comb, and a few other et ceteras of a hoosiery toilette. But the curiosities were “the two beds and all tuk up by the mother and the childurn.” What the bedsteads were made out of was not ascertained. Ricketty they were, screeching, squirming, and wriggling at every slight motion of the sleeping household; but tough and seasoned too 4* must they have been to bear up under their respective loads, especially considering the way some that night kicked under the covers, and, occasionally over them! In one bed were the lone (?) woman and two children; and in this I am confident having counted three heads, and one with a cap on. In the other were three or four bodies —Uncle John insisted on, four—but I only counted three heads at the bolster; yet Uncle John in his very last letter holds to it, that he saw another head sticking out near the foot, and two or three legs in such direction as could come only from a head in that latitude. Strong presumptive evidence, granted;—yet only presumptive, for a real backwood's boy can twist himself all round; beside the fleas[11] [11] Fleas out there are very savage—but while they make the folks very active in bed, they cannot wake them; for nothing scarcely breaks a woodsman's sleep. that night made the bed loads twist their utmost, and legs and arms became so surprisingly commingled, that no ordinary spectator could tell to what bodies they severally pertained. And never were beds so “all tuk up,” nor so wonderfully slept all over, till by daylight the whole of their sleep must have been fully extracted; and hence, it was plain enough there was no room for Uncle John or me in either bed; and that if we wanted any sleep we must get it out of the puncheons. We spread, therefore, our horse-blankets each on a puncheon, our separating line being an interstice of three inches; and, transforming saddlebags into pillows, we essayed to sleep away our weariness and hunger. But the “sweet restorer's” balmy influences were all confined that night, to the two regular beds; and that among other causes owing to a motherly she-swine with a litter of ever so many pigs, and some other bristled gentry in the basement, whence ascended an overpowering dry hickory nut fragrance, and endless variations of grunt, squeak, and shuffle—and in all likelihood the oceans of fleas disturbing us! If not thence, I leave it to such critics to ascertain, who delight in saying and finding smart things. Upon the whole it was not, then, so odd that about an hour before dawn, we made ready to set out in search of Fairplay. And of course our preparations awaked the lone woman; when the “cap,” already named, being elevated above the sleeping line of the other heads, and also several capless pates of dirty matted hair—(gender indeterminate)—being also raised and thrust forth in the other bed, we thus held our farewell colloquy: “Well, my good friend, we thank you kindly for your hospitality, and we are about starting now;—what shall we pay you?” “Laws! bless you, stranger! how you talk!—why do y' allow I'd axe people what's lost anything?—and for sich 'comedashins?” Oh! ma'am—but we put you to trouble—” “Trouble!—I don't mind trouble now no how—I've had too big a share on it to mind it any more amost—” “Why, ma'am, you've been very kind—and we really can't go away till we pay you something—” `Stranger!—I sees you wants to do what's right—but you needn't take out that puss—I'll have to be a most powerful heap poorer nor I'm now, afore I'll take anything for sich a poor shelter to feller critturs what's lost—and them a comin from meetin too! Ain't that oldermost stranger a kinder sort a preacher?” “No, my friend, I'm only a member—” “Well—I couldn't axe meetin folks nothin for the best. I'm right glad you didn't take the right hand trail below our fence, you'd a got into the swamp agin. Now jist mind when you come to a big sugar what blow'd down by the harricane, and take the left, and that will git you clear of the bio—and then keep rite strate on forrerd and you'll soon git to Fairplay.” Farewells were then cordially exchanged, and we left the poor lone woman with emotions of pity, gratitude, and admiration; and we thought too of “the cup of cold water” —“the two mites”—of “one half the world knows not how the other lives”—and “man wants but little here below”—and of all similar sacred and secular sayings, till we came to the prostrate sugar-tree. There we made a judicious digression to avoid miring and suffocating in the morass, and then shortly after dismounted safe and sound, but frightfully hungry, at Fairplay. And here we rest awhile to devour two breakfasts and repair if possible the loss of dinner and supper; and in the meanwhile we shall speak of the village. Fairplay was a smart place, consisting of two entirely new log houses, built last summer, in spite and opposition to Briarton concealed in the bushes on the other side of the river: and also a public or tavern—in futuro, however, as it was only now a-building. As yet it was not roofed entirely, nor were the second story floors laid, nor had it any chimneys. Indeed, its walls were incomplete, the daubing being—ah! what is the fashionable grammar here, for the case absolute? I do not wish to be behind the age too far, and am desirous of having the Fairplay hotel grammatically daubed. “Daubing being done?” No, it was not completed. “Daubing doing?”—that would make mud an active agent; whereas, in the operation, it is the most passive subject in the world, and is dreadfully trampled, pounded, beat, splashed, scattered and smeared. “Daubing a-doing?” no: the work had ceased for the present, and the clay was actually dry where the work had been “being” done. Stop! I have it—the daubing “being” being done! and so all eating and sleeping were in one large airy room below, with a flooring of unnailed boards, and half a dozen windows full of sashes but destitute of glass; and having also two doors closed with sheets instead of shutters. Cooking was performed to day out of doors; hence, while waiting for breakfast we inhaled the savory essence of fried chickens, fried bacon, roasted potatoes, herb-tea, store-coffee, and above all, of slap-jacks compounded from cornmeal, eggs and milk, and fried in a pan—thus in a measure getting two breakfasts out of one. True, with the fragrance entered the smoke; yet what great pleasure is without its concomitant pain! Beside—but take care! take care! here comes the breakfast, and we are ordered:— “Well, strangers! come, sit up and help yourselves. I allow you're a sorter hungry after sich a most powerful starvation.” Breakfast among the Stars “Landlord! our horses, if you please.” “They're at the door—they look a right smart chance wusted—but maybe they'll take you home—wish you a pleasant journey and no more scrapes.” The landlord's wishes were not disappointed, for in due time we were snug at home. CHAPTER XLI. “This man's brow, like to a title leaf, Foretells the nature of a tragic volume.” Not long after Mr. Seymour's return to Glenville, the patriarchal cabin with its acres of clearings, deadenings and girdlings, and with all its untouched and unfenced woods, was sold to a stranger; and then our friends all removed to Bishop Hilsbury's late residence, near the tannery. The name, indeed, was retained, but the glory of Glenville Settlement was fading. Still, visits were interchanged, although we of Woodville received more than we paid; and my emotions became most delightful, whenever returning on Saturday evenings from a short squirrel hunt, I discerned at a distance Uncle John's horse tied to our rack. Often, too, would some of us, the day he was expected, sit the last hour at an upper window, and watch the leafy barrier, where our dear friend was expected momentarily to break through into the mellow light of the departing sun—ay! that dear old man was so loved, we felt like hugging and kissing the very horse that brought him! Christmas was now approaching; and all Glenville that remained was expected to spend the holiday at Woodville. For this visit, our whole house had been prepared—bed-rooms were arranged to render sleeping warm and refreshing—fat poultry was killed—mince-pies concocted, cider bought; in short, all the goodies, vegetable, animal, and saccharine, usually congregated at this joyous season, were stored and ready. In the parlour, a compound of sitting-room, dining room, and bed-chamber, a magnificent fire of clean white sugar-tree with a green beech back-log was warming and enlivening; while the lid of the piano was raised, with copies of favourite pieces ready, and an eight-keyed flute, and a four-stringed violin on its top—all ready for a grand burst of innocent fun and frolic at the coming of the loved ones! Oh! we should be so happy! Night at length drew near; and so after an entire afternoon passed in expectation and affirmations, thus—“Well, they will be here in a few minutes, now!”—and after repeated visits to our observatory in the attic, we had concluded that, beyond all doubt, within a half-hour the cavalcade would arrive. But, that half-hour elapsed, and no friends came! and then another! and still another! and even then no friends! It was then so very much later than our old folks had been wont to come, that we all sat now in the gloom of disappointment around the parlour, uneasy, and with forebodings of evil—when the clatter of a horse moving rapidly over the frozen earth called us in haste to the door; upon opening which, John Glenville was seen dismounting, who immediately entered and with a countenance of deep distress— “Why, dear John! what is the matter?” “Melancholy enough! poor Uncle has fallen and broken his thigh! I've come over for Sylvan, and must go back with him instantly. I left word for him to be ready in fifteen minutes.” Ah! dear reader! if one's happiness is wholly from the earth, what shall we do when that happiness is so marred? Our joy became instant mourning—our pleasant apartment, cheerless—our dainty food, tasteless—our music, the voice of lamentation! Dear old kind-hearted man! after all the sore disappointments of a long life, is this sad affliction added to your sorrows, and pains, and many bodily injuries! Again, in old age, must you lie in that dark forest in the anguish of broken limbs!—again separated from many that so love you! What a Christmas eve for you! how different from those passed in our days of prosperity! For myself, when recalling the incidents of our late journey—our harmless pleasantries—our solemn and serious conversations—his hoary head on the floor of the lone woman's cabin—his patience, hilarity, and noble heart— and thought of him refused a night's lodging, who had sheltered and fed so many strangers, and of him turned, weary, hungry and sick into a western wilderness at night!—and now that grey head on a pillow of anguish! that pleasant face changed by pain! that often broken body again crushed and mangled—But, let us change the subject. Our friends had purposed leaving home early on the morning of the 24th, but an unforeseen business having called away John Glenville, the expedition was postponed a few hours. Yet when he came not at the hour, it was then concluded that the old folks should set out by themselves, with the belief that Mr. Glenville could easily over-take them on the road. To prepare the horses, Mr. Seymour descended a small hill to the stable, whilst Aunt Kitty remained in the cabin to arrange a few small matters previous to the starting. But as her brother was absent a full quarter of an hour beyond what seemed necessary, she stepped to the cabin-door, and with the slightest possible impatience—when, to her amazement, she heard a faint voice calling on her for help, and the groans of one as in great bodily pain! She flew in alarm down the hill—and at the stable-door lay Uncle John, his leg broken off at the head of the thigh bone, himself in an agony of pain, and in danger of perishing even from cold, without a speedy removal! His horse had proved restive on being led from the stable, and in a consequent struggle Mr. S. slipping on some ice had fallen and received the hurt. Aunt Kitty quickly decided on her plan. She brought from the cabin the buffalo robe bestowed by the Osage warchief, and spreading it near her wounded brother, she managed, weak and unaided, to get him, a large and heavy man, fairly into the middle of the robe. Staying, then, her tears, and raising her heart to God for fortitude and strength, she began to drag her mournful load towards the cabin. But she soon found herself too weak for the task, and in despair looked around—when, on her way home, and, by an unusual path near our cabin, passed now that very woman commemorated elsewhere in this work for a novel appearance in cow hunting! Catching a glimpse of this woman Aunt Kitty cried out for assistance; and the kind-hearted neighbour was almost instantly at her side, and adding a strength superior to that of a dozen pretty ladies, she soon, with Aunt Kitty's aid, had our wounded relative hauled to the cabin-door. Here, with great difficulty and labour on their part and pain on his, the sufferer was partly lifted and partly dragged up and over the steps and sill, and finally laid on a low bed prepared for his reception. Mrs. Littleton now examined her brother's wound, and with the help of her humble friend, she forced the leg into something like a natural position, and then splintered and bandaged it, to the best of her ability. In a few minutes after this, John Glenville entered the cabin, who, on learning the mournful accident, instantly remounted and hurried to Woodville. Dr. Sylvan was unfortunately not at home, and we obtained only one of his students; when Glenville, having refreshed himself a few moments with us, was, attended by the pupil, quickly replunged into the cold and darkness of a now tempestuous night and howling wilderness! They reached the cabin a short time before day-break: but the embryo surgeon, without adding or taking from, deemed it best to let all the bandages remain as Aunt Kitty had bound them! And so poor Uncle John, after lying on his bed for seventy wearisome days and nights, rose again to life and health—yet not to his former shape and activity; for the leg had shrunk in the knitting of the bone, and his right side was two inches shorter than before the accident. And yet, reader, so youthful and buoyant the spirit of this noble old gentleman, that he and I hunted often together after his recovery—he walking with a crutch in one hand and a heavy rifle in the other! But so gloomy had become the cabin life to the old folks, where death might easily occur from the absence of ordinary help, and where, perhaps, Uncle John's deformity might have been lessened by prompt medical aid, that our tannery was sold, and our relatives removed to Woodville. Mr. Glenville, however, chose a new site for a store several miles from the old settlement, which then, as to us, ceased to be—save that sacred spot reserved in the sale, and where rest, far from us, scattered as we are, and ever in this life shall be, the ashes of the mother! Once, and but once, subsequent to this desertion, did I pass along a new road laid through that settlement, and between the two cabins. Around, for many acres, the forest was no more, but corn and grain were ripening in its place. A new brick house stood in our garden; and the cabin was changed into a stable. And yet, while all the changes were for the better, and a most joyous evening was smiling on the coming harvest—I sat on my horse and had one of my girlish fits of tears! Yes!—I cried like Homer's heroes—and that in spite of the critic who, running over the book to make an article, will say, “the author, tender-hearted soul, cries again towards the close of year the third, Chap. xli. p. 77, Vol. II.” Yes!—I cried! And since that summer's evening, I have never seen my first forest home; for I purposely ever after avoided the hateful new road through it, and that too by the Indian grave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FOURTH YEAR. CHAPTER XLII. “Sit mihi fas audita loqui.” “It is the witness still of excellency To put a stranger face on his own perfection.” Our fourth year introduces an epoch, the Augustan age of the New Purchase—the opening of the State College! And now comes on the stage, as one principal actor, my friend, the Reverend Charles Clarence, A.M., Principal and Professor of Ancient Languages. This gentleman had accepted our appointment, not for the paltry stipend paid as his salary, but wholly because he longed to be in the romantic West, and among its earliest literary pioneers; and hence, early this spring, he was with us, and not merely ready, but even enthusiastically impatient to commence his labours. His wife was with him—the woman of his seven years' love! They had tasted, however, the wormwood of affliction's cup, and even now wore the badges of recent bereavements. Mr. Clarence, leaving his wife and two little children, went to the South again on business; and after an absence of four months, on returning to his boardinghouse in Philadelphia, he was surprised at hearing and seeing no signs of his babes. His wife, instead of answering in words his eager questions, suddenly threw her arms about his neck, and bursting into an agony of tears, exclaimed,—“Both are dead!—come into our room—I'll tell you all!” Here was a sad waking from day-dreaming! and Clarence was with us, having altered views of life, and seeing that we have something to do in it, besides to amuse or be amused. Happy chastisement our friend afterwards deemed it, when encountering sore disappointments and many, in his professional career: ay! he was destined to endure the utter crushing of all his high hopes and purposes. For, if ever man was influenced by disinterested motives, and fired with enthusiasm for advancing solid learning,—if ever one desirous of seeing Western institutions rival if not excel others,—if ever a person came willing to live and die with us, and to sacrifice eastern tastes and prejudices, and become, in every proper way, a Western Man, my friend Clarence was he. His labours and actions proved this. Look for instance at his daily teaching—his five and six hours usually spent in the recitation room; at his preaching, always twice on the Sabbath, and commonly several times during the week; at his visits to the sick and the dying, and his attendance on funerals! And these things extended beyond his own denomination—when requested, and that was often; for rarely, even in his own sicknesses and melancholy hours, did he refuse what seemed his duty to others. When too feeble to leave his house, he heard the recitations in his bed; and when unable to stand, he sat in his congregation and preached, his person emaciated and his face death-like. Nor did he confine his teaching to the routine himself had followed, but he introduced other branches, and also a course of Greek, unknown then in western colleges, and not common in eastern ones; and this, although it added to the severity of his private studies, and for many months kept his lamp[12] [12] A tin lamp, supplied with melted lard, and suspended at the end of a wooden crane, whose perpendicular shaft moved in sockets fastened to the wall. burning even till two o'clock! His only inquiry was, how can I best promote the interests of the institution? In short, therefore, all his learning, his talents, his experience, his accomplishments, were freely and heartily employed and given, in season and out of season;—and a knowledge of all the music he possessed, vocal and instrumental, was imparted, gratuitously, to the students—and also grammar, moral philosophy, and the like, gratuitously, and at extra hours, to certain teachers of ordinary schools, and some of these his former opponents! Much more could we say, if the modesty of my friend permitted; but he affirms positively that he will not edit the book if I do not stop here. And yet this man was no match for veteran cunning; we must not, however, antici pate—and so we shall begin regularly at the beginning, and go on till we end with the end; refreshing, during the story, our spirits with the occasional pleasant matters belonging to our rather tangled road. Be it remembered, as was intimated in the early part of volume first, that Uncle Sam is an undoubted friend of public education, and that, although so sadly deficient in his own; and hence, in the liberal distribution of other folk's land, he bestowed on us several entire townships for a college or university. It was, therefore, democratically believed, and loudly insisted on, that as the State had freely received, it should freely give; and that “larnin, even the most powerfullest highest larnin,” should at once be bestowed on every body! and without a farthing's expense! Indeed, some gravely said and argued that teachers and professors in the “people's college ought to sarve for the honour!” or at least be content with “a dollar a day, which was more nor double what a feller got for mauling rails!” The popular wrath therefore was at once excited almost to fury when necessity compelled us to fix our tuition fee at ten dollars a year; and the greatest indignation was felt and expressed towards Clarence “as the feller what tuk hire for teaching and preaching, and was gettin to be a big-bug on the poor people's edicashin money.” Be it recollected too, that both big and little colleges were erected by persons who, with reverence be it spoken, in all matters pertaining to “high larnin,” had not sufficient discrimination to know the second letter of an alphabet from a buffalo's foot. Nothing, we incline to believe, can ever make State schools and colleges very good ones; but nothing can make them so bad, we repeat, as for Uncle Sam to leave every point open to debate, especially among ignorant, prejudiced, and selfish folks in a New Purchase. For while trustees may be ninnies, nincompoops, or even ninnyhammers as to proper plans and buildings, yet are such when masons, bricklayers and carpenters, keen-sighted enough to secure the building contracts for themselves and their friends, and curiously exorbitant in their demands on the sub-treasurers for their silly work. The mean-looking and ridiculous arrangements at Woodville cost as much, perhaps more, than suitable things would have cost; so that when a college is to be commenced, it ought to be done, not only by honest but by wise, learned, classical men; but as such are not abundant in very new settlements, let such men at Washington—(and such are at Uncle Sam's bureau)—let them prescribe when, and how, and where, our new western institutions are to be; and if rebellious democrats refuse the gift so encumbered, let it thus be given to more modest and quiet democrats. Proceed we, however, to open the college. And my narration may be depended on, as Clarence has reviewed the whole and says it is substantially correct,—indeed, in some respect I was a quorum-pars. The institution was opened the first day of May, at 9½ o'clock, A.M., anno Domini 1800 and so forth. And, some floors being unlaid, and the sashes all being without glass, the opening was as complete as possible—nearly like that of an Irish hedge school! When the Principal—(so named in our minutes and papers, but by the vulgar called master, and by the middle sort, teacher,)—appeared, a clever sprinkle of boy[13] [13] A very lively animal anywhere—but a very peculiar one out there. was in waiting; most of which firmly believed that, by some magic art, our hero could, and being paid by government, should, and without putting any body to the expense of books and implements, touch and transmute all, and in less than no time, into great scholars. “Boys and young gentle men,” said Mr. C. compounding the styles of a pedagogue and professor, “I am happy to see you; and we are now about to commence our State College, or, as some call it, the Seminary. I hope all feel what an honour attends being the first students in an institution so well endowed; and which, therefore, by proper exertions on our parts, may eventually rise to the level of eastern colleges, and become a blessing to our State and country. You have all, I suppose procured the necessary books, of which notice was given at meeting, and in several other ways, for the last four weeks.” “I've got 'em—” “Me too—” “I've brung most on 'em—” “Master—Uncle Billy's to fetch mine out in his wagin about Monday next—” “Father says he couldn't mind the names and wants them on a paper—” “Books!—I never heern tell of any books—wont these here ones do, Master?—this here's the Western Spellin one—and this one's the Western Kalkelatur?” “Mr. Clarinse—I fotch'd my copy-book and a bottle of red-ink to sit down siferin in—and daddy wants me to larn book-keepin and surveyin.” “Order boys—order!”—(hem!)—“let all take seats in front. There is a misunderstanding with some, both as to the books and the whole design and plan of the school, I perceive. This is a Classical and Mathematical School; and that fact is stated and fully explained in the trustees, public advertisements; and no person can be admitted un-less one intending to enter upon and pursue the prescribed course; and that includes even at the start Latin, Greek, and Algebra. Now, first, let us see who are to study the dead languages—” “I do—I do—me too—me too,” &amp;c., &amp;c. “Do you, then, sit there. Well—now let me have your names for the roll—A. Berry—S. Smith—C. D. &amp;c., &amp;c. —ten names—I will attend to you ten directly, so soon as I have dismissed the others. I regret, my young friends, that you are disappointed--but I am only doing my duty; indeed, if I wished I have no power to admit you, unless to the course of studies—nay, even the trustees have power to do only what they have done. I hope, therefore, you will now go home, and explain the matter to your friends—” By several— “Daddy says he doesen't see no sort a use in the high larn'd things—and he wants me to larn Inglish only, and bookkeepin, and surveyin, so as to tend store and run a line.” “I allow, Mister, we've near on about as good a right to be larn'd what we wants, as them tother fellers on that bench;—it's a free school for all.” “I am sorry, boys, for this misunderstanding; but we cannot argue the subject here. And yet every one must see one matter plainly; for instance, any man has a right to be governor, or judge, or congressman; yet none of you can be elected before the legal age, and before having some other qualifications. It is so here, you all have a right to what we have to bestow; but you must be qualified to enter; and must be content to receive the gift of the State in the way the law provides and orders. You will please go home now.” The disappointed youngsters accordingly withdrew; and with no greater rudeness than was to be expected from undisciplined chaps, full of false notions of rights, and possessed by a wild spirit of independence. Hence, Mr. C. heard some very flattering sentiments growled at him by the retiring young democrats; but which, when they had fairly reached the entry, were bawled and shouted out frankly and fearlessly. And naturally after this he was honoured with some high sounding epithets by certain hypocritical demagogues in rabblerousing speeches—sneaking gentlemen, who aimed to get office and power by endless slanders on the college, and most pitiful and malicious slang about “liberty and equality, and rights, and tyranny, and big-bugs, and poor people, and popular education,” et id omue genus! Ay! certain small-petato-patriots publicly on the stump avowed “it was a right smart chance better to have no collidge no how, if all folks hadn't equal right to larn what they most liked best.” And two second-rate pettifoggers electioneered on this principle; “that it was most consistent with the republicanism taught by the immortal Jefferson, and with the genius of our institutions, to use the college funds to establish common schools for rich and poor alike, and make the blessings of education like air, sunshine, and water!” Clarence, therefore, was now hated and villified, as the supposed instrument of pride and aristocracy, in drawing a line between rich and poor;[14] [14] Of the ten boys who entered the college, seven or eight were poor —many that would not enter were rich. and for a while his person, his family, his very house was abominated. On one occasion he was in Woodville when a half drunken brute thus halloed against him—“thare goes that darn'd high larn'd bug what gits nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents of the people's eddekashin money for larnin ristekrats sons high flown words—gimme that 'are stone and I'll do for him.” Whether this was fun or earnest, Clarence did not care to ascertain; for hearing the sneers and derision of the bystanders, and fearing it might become earnest, he took shelter in my store. At another time walking with Professor Harwood in the outskirts of the village, they heard a cry in their rear— “knock 'em down”—when suddenly turning, there stood a stout chap flourishing a bludgeon over their heads, evidently, Vol. II.—5 indeed, in a sort of fun, which was, however, an index of the popular ill-will and spite. When persons rode by his dwelling, remarks like the following would be shouted forth:— “Well—thar's whar the grammur man lives that larns 'em Latin and grand-like things—allow we'll oust him yet —he dosen't own little college any how; he's poor as Job's turkey, if it want for that powerful sallury the trustees give him.” Clarence's salary was four hundred dollars per annum! “Well,” bawled out one fellow—“dog my hide if that ain't the furst time I ever seed that big man's door open!— hem!—powerful fine carpet!—(a beautiful rag carpet made by Mrs. C.)—allow, people's eddekashin money bought that!” Even Mr. C.'s gratuitous preaching could not secure him from ill-natured remarks. “Well,” said an occasional hearer to another once—“how do y'like that sort a preachin?” “Foo!” was the reply. “I don't want no more sich! I like a man that kin jist read, and then I know it comes from the sperit! he tuk out his goold watch twice to show it, and was so d—mnation proud he wouldn't kneel down to pray!” But the reader may wish to know how Mr. Clarence got along with “the Few.” Well, as the warm weather approached, the “boys and young gentlemen” came to recitation without coats; and, as the thermometer arose, they came without shoes — “What! in the State college? Could your Mr. Clarence not have things ordered with more decency?” Softly, Mr. Dignity—in a world where our presiding judge, a man of worth and great abilities, presided in court without his coat and cravat, and with his feet modestly reposed on the upper rostrum, thus showing his boot-soles to by-standers and lawyers; where lawyers were stripped and in shirt-sleeves; and where even Governor Sunbeam, in a stump speech, gave blast to his nose pinched between a thumb and finger, and wiped said pinchers afterwards on the hinder regions of his inexpressibles; do you, sir, think our Mr. C., or all eastern dignitaries combined, could have compelled young bushwhackers to wear coats and shoes in recitation rooms? He indeed ventured once as follows:— “Young gentlemen”—(hem!)—“why do you attend recitations without coats and shoes?” “'Tis cooler, sir!”—with surprise. “Ay! so it is—perhaps it would be still cooler if you came without your pantaloons.” Haw! haw!—by the whole ten. “And did they, Mr. Carlton, come without their indispensables?” Oh! dear me! no; on the contrary, the young gentlemen were so tickled at our professor's pleasant hint direct, that next day they not only come in their breeches, but also with shoes and coats on! But still, many proper regulations of our friend were distasteful to scholars and parents equally —for instance, the requirement of a written excuse for certain absences. One parent, an upper class Thompsonian doctor, did, indeed, once send a note—but that was an insolent[15] [15] How should a steam-doctor know better? out there. and peremptory order to Clarence to believe in future his son, without a written excuse! And another person, a captain in the late war, not only refused to write a note, but he sent a verbal message by his son to the master, viz.—“Charley Clarence, you needn't think of introducing your d—n Yankee tricks out here!” “Yes! yes!—raise your hands, and elevate your eyebrows, good folks. Mr. C. did all that sort of thing too, at first; but he lived long enough with us to get used to mat ters! The only evil was, that, like the Irish Greek's famous horse that unluckily died, just when he had learned to live without eating,[16] [16] That curious art has been revived lately in Great Britain, and is practiced extensively and with great success among the poor. our professor, when he had outlived his prejudices, and abandoned his Yankee ways, fell a victim to veteran cunning and artifice; and was forced, like Aristides, to obey the Ostracism! CHAPTER XLIII. “This is some fellow Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness.” “What would you have, you curs?” The nature of our favourite doctrine—the sovereignty of the people—is but imperfectly understood from theory; and, truly, what importance to the vast majority to be called kings, unless opportunities are afforded to exercise the royal prerogatives? True, in the constitutions of the twenty-six States, are paper models of republican governments, the purest in nature; such as the monarchical-republic, the oligarchic, the aristocratic, the federal, the democratic, ay, the cheatitive or repudiative, the despotic, the mobocratic, the anarchic, cum multis al is: but what of all this, if the citizen kings cannot be indulged in a little visible, tangible, audible, law-making, law-judging and law-executing? Now, in the New Purchase, the people universal, the people general, the people special, of every county, town and village, of every sect, religious and irreligious, of every party, political, impolitical, and non-political, were indulged in bona fide acts of real rity-dity sovereignty. And each and every part, party, and parcel, lorded it over the whole, and over one another; and the whole over the parts and over itself—ay, and every one that did it against the wall, ruled the State and the nation, and his neighbour, and then turned round and ruled himself, not in the fear of heaven, but in the fear of the people! The fact is, we did nothing else than rule one another; and none ever even obeyed for fear of disobeying; and hence our public servants (and we kept them sweating) being distracted by opposite instructions from different constituents—(for candidates with us only carried up votes, wishes, &amp;c.)—from Thomas and Richard and Henry and Squire Rag and Major Tagg and Mister Bobtail, and being imperiously ordered to rob Peter to pay Paul, our public servants, poor knaves and honest rascals, would not obey, simply out of reverence and for fear of offeuding and hurting our feelings! Here follows a specimen of the people ruling the college and the college ruling the people. We, the people of the Trustees, for the good of the people general, did resolve this autumn to elect a Professor of Mathematics and advertised accordingly. This of itself enraged the people who set no value on learning, and deemed one small salary a waste of the poor people's education money; but when rumour declared we intended to elect a man nominally a Rat,[17] [17] Nickname for a religious sect in the Purchase. (Mr. Clarence being also a Rat,) the wrath was roused of the people, religious, and irreligious, of all other sects. This, indeed, was confined to Woodville; for from the very first, we, the people of Woodville and thereabouts, did kindly adopt the State College as ours; and we, therefore, claimed the sole right of superintending the Legislature, the Board of Visitors, the Board of Trustees, the Faculty, proper and improper, the Students, foreign and domestic, the Funds, the Buildings —the everything; and for some time we ordered and regulated, and turned in and out most despotically. Well, the people having united the peoples in a fixed purpose, viz.—to keep out a Rat, but not having united them in any purpose of putting in anybody else, the people, now sovereign and of many kings, held a meeting up town in the court-house yard; while we, the trustee-people and sovereigns of another sort, were holding our meeting to elect a professor in the prayer-hall of Big College; and then the People's-people, formed under the command of Brigadier Major General Jacobus, Esq., Clerk of Court, Chief Librarian of Woodville Library, and Deputy Post Master under his late Majesty, General Andrew Jackson, marched down in a formidable battalion to give us our orders. This grand dignitary of so many tails we have just named, was most fit head to the fit body he conducted. He was no inconsiderable a people himself, being very fat and very saucy; nay, as in warm weather he always appeared without coat, vest, cravat, and usually with slouched hat, shoes down at heel on stockingless feet, and one “gallus” hard strained to keep up his greasy and raggy breeches; and as in this costume he strutted everywhere full of swagger and brag, he was then the best living and embodied personification of a mistaken, conceited, meddlesome, pragmatical people anywhere to be found. He flourished in that grand era, rotation in office; but by him it was interpreted a rotation out of one public office into another—yea! even now he actually sustained at once seven salaried offices little and big—yea! moreover to these seven tails he added and very commonly exhibited another —the tail of his shirt! Now, one may conceive how our great father of one or more terms looks; one can even imagine how Uncle Sam looks; but who forms approximating conceptions of that proteus sovereign—the People! Believe me, his rowdy majesty, General Jacobus, is as near a likeness, in many essential respects, as can be obtained—but this is digression. Our honourable Trustees were, as usual, sitting with open doors, and hence were, as heretofore, accommodated with numerous lobby members; and these kept muttering discontent at our doings, and often volunteered remarks in a play-house whisper for our correction and guidance. Dr. Sylvan, however, who anticipated a storm, had contrived to put the vote for Mr. Harwood's election, a little prior to the first faint noise of the coming cataract of turbid waters, and had succeeded in securing this gentleman's unanimous choice—when a considerable hurrahing outside announced the People's people—and in a moment after, in swaggered his greasy royalty, General Jacobus, followed by as much of the ultimate sovereignty as could squeeze into the room. And then King Slouch commenced as follows:— “Mr. President and gentlemen of the Board!—hem!— I have the honour to be the orgun of the people—hem! —and by their orders I've come in here, to forbid the election of Mr. Harwood of Kaintuckey, as our Professur of Mathematucs—hem!—in the people's collidge—he-e-m!! You'r all servunts of the people and hainit the right no how to give away their edicashion money without thar consent —I say—hem!—as all is not admitted to these here halls of science—he-e-m!! And the people in the inbred, incohesive use of thar indefeesibul native rights, order me thar orgun to say they don't want two teachers of the same religion no how—and I say it—and I say, Mr. President, they say its better to have them of different creeds, and I say that too—for they say they'll watch one another and not turn the students to thar religion and—hem! Yes, the people in their plentitude have met, and they say they don't want no church and state—and I say it; for thar's a powerful heap of danger to let one sect have all the power— and I call on this board to let their historic recollections be —be—recollected—and wasn't thar John Calvin, the moment he got the power, didn't he burn poor Mikul Servetis at the stake—and—and—so ain't it plain if two men here git all the power thar's a beginning of church and state, as that immortal Jefferson says? And who knows if you and me and the people here mayn't be tortered and burn'd yet in a conflagaration of fagguts and fire? Who then with this probability—” Here Dr. Sylvan, our worthy President, interrupted the speaker, the doctor being now only recovered from his surprise; for, veteran as he was in politics, and often as he had known the people essay small overt acts of sovereignty, this affair was so novel and so grandly impudent, that it took him the first half of the harangue to collect himself, and the other to concoct the following judicious compound of decision, sarcasm and blarney:— “It is with regret, General Jacobus and my respected fellow citizens, I interrupt the eloquent utterance of sentiments so patriotic and so well adapted to excite our disgust and horror at a union of Church and State; but in the present case, I do really believe the danger is not to be apprehended. In the first place, we all know the liberal sentiments of Professor Clarence towards all religious bodies; and in the second place, the gentleman just elected by us before the entrance of your honourable body and organ, is not known to be a member of any communion; and lastly, we Trustees are of six different denominations ourselves, and therefore, as we put in we can also put out, the instant danger is found to threaten the State from our present course. And, fellow-citizens, we shall, I am confident, be quite Argus-eyed over our faculty—but at all events we have gone too far to retrace our steps; for Mr. Harwood is legally appointed, and for what we deemed good reasons. And surely no American citizen in this glorious land of equal rights and blood-bought liberties, where the meanest felon has a trial by jury, will contend that an honourable and unoffending man of another state— the noble old Kentucky—should be turned out of office— and no accusation against his competency and moral character? Backwoodsmen don't ask that!—and they don't think of it. Had this honourable representation come fifteen minutes sooner, something might have been done or prevented;—for we are indeed servants of the people—but Mr. Harwood ought now to have time to show himself, and cannot be degraded without an impeachment. And who is ready to impeach a Kentuckian because John Calvin or John Anybody else burnt Servetus a hundred years ago?— and that, when it is not even known whether Mr. Harwood himself might not have been roasted in the days of persecution for some heresy mathematical or religious! Fellow citizens, our meeting is adjourned.” Our venerable Congress at Washington sometimes gets into a row, and even breaks up in a riot. And why should it not be so, when many conscript fathers have practised bullyism from early life, and have only gone to the great conservative assembly to do, on a large scale, dirty things often done before on a small one? Or why, on the other hand, if the reverend young fathers there set us, the people, the example, should any person affect to wonder that we sometimes imitate our law givers? Whether we, the New Purchase people, set or followed the example, need not be determined; but we certainly adjourned to-day in a grand kick-up; which, if described, must be in the pell-mell style of history. At the word “adjourned,” ending Doctor Sylvan's speech, came a violent and simultaneous rush; some pushing towards the door, to get out—some from without into the door, to get in—and some towards the clerk's seat, to seize and destroy the record: but that wary officer, at the 5* same word just named, had quietly slipped the sacred record into his breeches' pocket, the minutes being only recorded with a lead pencil on a quarter sheet of cap paper. Then commenced a hell-a-below, loud enough at first, but which, like a Latin Inceptive, still went on and tended to perfection; being an explosion commingled of growl, curse, hurrah, hiss, stamp, and clap; and then and there and all through the “mass meeting,” were Brigadier Major General Jacobus, and our people and the people's people and other people, all huddled and crowded and mixed, and all and every one and each were and was explaining, demanding, denying, do-telling, and wanting to know, somewhat thus: “Hurrah for Harwood!—damn him and Clarinse too— ain't the money our'n, that's what I want to know?—I say Doctor, remember next 'lection!—that's the pint—you lie, by the lord Harry!—let me out, blast your eyes!—it ain't— it tis—let us in, won't you?—do tell—General Jacobus ought to have his nose pulled—he didn't burn him—don't tell me—pull it if you dare—he burnt hisself—go to the devil—no patchin' to him—powerful quick on the trigger— Calvin—get up petition to legislature—rats—didn't I say we ought to get down sooner?—faggots—Harwood ain't— gunpowder—darn'd clever fellow—Servetus—hurrah for hic haec hoc!—let's out—give 'em more money—let's in— is the board to be forced?—get out o' my way—fair trial— don't blast—answer that—I know better—'tain't—'tis—hold your jaw—whoo!—shoo!—hiss — hinyow—bowwow— rumble—grumble—Sylvan—Clarinse—Jacobus—Harwood Servetus”—&amp;c. &amp;c., and away rolled majesty, till the noise in the distance was like the grum mutter of retiring thunder! How awfully grand and solemn a little people in the swell of arrogated supremacy! But we saw King Mob to greater advantage next year; which sight shall be duly set before our readers. Meanwhile we shall take a pleasant rural excursion in the following chapter, by way of recreating after our toils in behalf of learning. CHAPTER XLIV. “We still have slept together, Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together.” “—are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court?” Reader! “Well, what now?” Will you go with us? Come, surely Tippecanoe will arouse you; and although we have miles of dark, tangled, and, in places, almost untrodden forests to pass; although we shall ford and swim creeks, swollen from recent rains, and where a blundering horse would plunge the rider into rapid and whirling waters; and although some inconveniences and customs will be found inconsistent with steamboats and rail road journeys, yet who will not risk all to stand on the battle field of the brave, amid the sadness of its solitary and far distant prairie! “Very eloquent!—but, Mr. Carlton, only think of the mud.” Yes, dear reader, but the girls are to go along. “Girls!” Yes, and very pretty and intelligent ones too—real lady Hoosiers. “Are you in earnest? Who are they?” The young ladies of Miss Emily Glenville's Woodville Female Institute. “Oh!—ay!—I had forgot your school—what then?” Why, it is our vacation, and myself with one or two other gentlemen are going to escort the girls home. Seven of the pupils belong to wealthy and respectable families in the north, and one or two live very near to Tippecanoe. “Heigho!—out of compliment to the ladies we go; but how long will you be yet?” Oh, we shall get through after a while. “No lane,” you know, &amp;c. Of course then you consent. Well, our party consisted of eleven persons—the seven girls, the father and brother of one girl, and myself and young Mr. Frank, of Woodville, who, like myself, wished to see the world. To carry us were precisely ten horses and a half, the fractional creature being a dwarf pony, an article or noun, which young B—k, the brother rode, like a velocipede, and which, by pressing the toes of boots against hard and hilly places in the path, could be aided by pushing. And thus, also, the rider could a sorter stand and go, like wheels in motion, at once; and all that would greatly relieve the tedium of monotonous riding. The special use of the pouy was manifested in fording mud-holes, quicksands, quagmires, marshes, high waters, and the like. In vain did the rider pull up his limbs;[18] [18] Lower limbs here, in contradistinction to upper ones. in vain shrink away up towards the centre of his saddle—up followed the cream-coloured mud in beech swamps, the black mud and water in bayous, the black mud itself in walnut and sugar lands, or the muddy water in turbid creeks and rivers, and the rider became deeply interested in the circulating medium. But what a contrast to a stage coach, to say nothing of a car; ten horses and upwards to carry eleven people! And how I do wish you could have seen us set out! Dear, oh dear! the scampering, and tearing, and winnowing, and kicking up, and cocking of ears, as the quadrupeds were “being” rid up to the rack! and then the clapping on of horse-blankets and saddles, male and female, croopers and circingles and bridles, double and single! What a drawing of girths! What a fixing and unfixing and refixing of saddle-bags! What a hanging of “fixins” themselves, done up in red handkerchiefs on the horns of the gentler sex saddles! And then the girls—like the barbarians in Cæsar's Commentaries in one battle, they seemed to be every where at once—up stairs, down stairs, on the stairs, in the closet under the stairs! They were in the house, out of the house, in the yard, at the door, by the horses! And oh how they did ask questions and get answers. “Where's my shawl?” “Is this it?” “Did nobody see my basket?” “I didn't.” “Who's got my album?” “Mr. Frank.” “Will some body fasten my fixens?” “He ain't here.” “Won't nobody carry this?” and so on through all the bodies. The animals were now all harnessed, and stood comparatively quiet, except an occasional impatient stamp, or an active and venomous switch of a tail: the bustle, too, had subsided, and all had come to that silent state when no more questions can be asked, but all are waiting for some one to begin the—farewell. And then came that sad word, amid gushing tears—mid sobs and kisses—for with some “the schooling” was finished, and “who could tell whether ever more should meet” those sprightly, happy, sweet companions! But soon followed the uproar of mounting; and with that seemed to pass all sorrow; and yet so painful had been the last few moments, that an excuse was needed for saying and doing something lively. Of course we all said a great many smart things, or what passed for such, in the way of compliment, raillery and repartee; and we guessed and reckoned and allowed and foretold the most contrary matters about the weather, and the roads, and the waters, and even about our fates through the whole of our coming lives. In the meanwhile horse after horse was paraded towards the block, each receiving extra jerks, and some handsome slaps and kicks on the off flank, to make him wheel into position, when next moment away he scampered with a side-way rider, in trot, shuffle, pace, or canter, according to his fancy, till all the lady riders were on the saddles, and then Mr. B—k, sen., and myself riding in advance, he shouted, “Come on, girls—we're off.” And off it was—amidst the giggling of girls, and the laughter of neighbours, nodding good-byes with their heads, or shaking them out of handkerchiefs, from doors and windows; and also the boisterous farewells of some two dozen folks that had helped us fix. Off it was, some at a hard trot, some at a round gallop, and others at a soft pace or shuffle, the animals snorting, squeeling, and winnowing —sometimes six abreast, sometimes two, sometimes all huddled like a militia cavalry training; and then all in Indian file, one by one, with yards of space between us! Oh! the squeezing of lower limbs against horse rumps!— the kicking and splattering of mud!—the streaming forth of ill-secured kerchiefs and capes! Oh! the screeching! shouting! laughing! shaking! What flapping of saddle-skirts! What walloping of saddle-bags! Away with stages!—steamers!—cars! Give me a horse and the life, activity and health of Hoosiers and Hoosierinas let loose all at once in the whirligig storm and fury of that morning's starting! We soon degenerated into a slow trot, and finally into a fast walk, with episodial riding to scare a flock of wild turkies, or add wings to the flight of a deer; till we all became at last so shaken down and settled in our saddles as to seem each a compound of man (homo) and horse. Yet for hours we kept up talk of all kinds. Yea! we halloed — we quizzed — we laughed! Ay! we talked seriously too—for no one rides through our grand woods any more than he sails forth on the grand waters, and feels not solemn! And we even talked religiously—more so than most readers would care to hear! Lively, indeed, we were—but God even then was in our thoughts; and some of that happy company were then, and are yet, ornaments of the Christian world—some are in heaven! Yes, then as now, we often passed, as is the case with the joyous, the frank-hearted, the middle class,[19] [19] To that we belong, and hope we always shall:—“Give me neither poverty nor riches.” and, in an instant, from laughter to tears. No halt was made for dinner: it was handed round on horseback. A piece, or half a piece of ham, boxed neatly between two boards of corn broad, and held delicately— as possible—between the finger and thumb of an attendant, was thus presented for acceptance. Yet not always was it easy to take the proffered dainties; since often the horse, out of sheer affectation, or because of a sly kick or switch from an unseen quarter, would, at the instant of captation, jump aside, or leap forward, and verify the proverb —“many a slip between the cup and the lip.” Towards evening it was heard that Slippery River was falling, but could not yet be forded; and hence it was determined to stay all night in a cabin several miles this side, in expectation of our being able to ford in the morning. We were, of course, received by our friends with open hearts, and entertained in the most approved backwoods' style,—the only awkwardness being that beds could be furnished but for four of our party. As some, therefore, must sleep on the floor, it was unanimously voted that all should share alike in the hardship and frolic of a puncheon's night's rest; and hence, in due season, all hands were piped to convert our supper-room into a grand bed-chamber. And first, the floor was swept; secondly, our blankets were spread on it; thirdly, over these horse-cloths was put a good rag carpet; and, lastly, in a line were ranged saddle-bags and valises, interspersed with other bolsters and pillows stuffed with feathers and rags; and then, the fire being secured, we all began to undress— “Oh! goodness! Mr. Carlton!—girls! and all?” Girls and all, my dear. “I vow then, I will never marry and go to a New Purchase! But did the ladies really divest—hem!—before— the—the—” To be sure. “What! take off all the usual—” Oh! that I cannot say. Western gentlemen never peep. Besides the gentlemen took off only coats and boots; and intelligent ladies everywhere always know how to act according to necessity. Our order of “reclinature,” as Doctor Hexagon would here doubtless say, was as follows: Mr. B—k, sen., reclined first, having on his outside next the door, his son, and on the inside, his daughter; then the other girls, one after another, till all were finished; then his modesty, Mr. C., who, having a wife at home, was called, by courtesy to suit the occasion, an old man; and then, outside him, and next the other door, young Mr. Frank— “I never!”[20] [20] What! never read the story of Boaz and Ruth? —and then after a little nearly inaudible whispering, bursting at short intervals into very audible giggles, the hush of the dark wilderness came upon us—and—an—a— “What?” Hey!—oh!—ah!—I beg pardon—I think we must have been asleep! After breakfast our friend Mr. B—k, sen., offered an earnest prayer, in which thanks were returned for past mercies and favours, and supplication made for protection during the prospective perils of the day; and in an hour after we were within sight, and hearing too, of the sullen and angry flood. The waters had, indeed, fallen in a good degree, and they were still decreasing, yet no person, a stranger to the West, could have looked on that foaming and eddying river leaping impetuous over the rocky bed, and have heard the echoes of its many thunders calling from cliff to cliff, and from one dark cavern to another in the forest arched over the water,—no inexperienced traveller. all sign of hoof and wheel leading to the ford obliterated, could have supposed that our party, and mostly very young girls, were seriously preparing to cross that stream on our horses! But either that must be, or our path be retraced; and sobered, therefore, although not intimidated, we made ready for the perilous task. The older and more resolute girls were seated on the sure-footed horses, and all their dresses were properly arranged, and all loose cloaks and clothes carefully tied up, that, in case of accident, nothing might entangle the hands or feet. Several little girls were to be seated behind the gentlemen, while a loose horse or two was left to follow. We gentlemen riders were also to ride between two young ladies, to aid in keeping their horses right, to seize a rein on emergencies, and to encourage the ladies, in case they showed any symptoms of alarm. Things ready, we all rode boldly to the water's edge; where a halt was called, till Mr. B—k and Mr. C. should go foremost and try the ford. And now, dear reader, it may be easy to ford Slippery River in this book, and maybe Mr. C. has contrived to seem courageous like—but that morning, at first sight of that ugly water, he did secretly wish it had been bridged, and feel—that is—wished all safe over; and possibly had he been favoured with a few moments' more reflection, he might have been rather scared—yet just then, souse went Mr. B. up to his saddle-skirts, seeming a man on a saddle with a tail streaming out horizontally, and then came his voice thus:— “Come on, Carlton!—come on!” “Ay! ay! sir—I'm in—souse—splash! Oho! the water's in my boots!” “Hold up your legs!—why don't you?” “Forgot it, Mr. B.—don't care now—can't get any wetter.” N. B. None, save born and bred woodsmen, can keep the limbs properly packed and dry on the horse neck, in deep fords: naturalized woodmen never do it either gracefully or successfully. I have myself vainly tried a hundred times: but at the first desperate plunge and lurch of the quadruped, I have always had to unpack the articles and let them drop into the water—otherwise I should have dropped myself. Mr. B. and myself rode around and into the deepest places, satisfying ourselves and the rest, that with due caution and fortitude the ford was practicable—or nearly so: and then I returned for the girls, while Mr. B. rode down and stationed himself in the middle river about twenty-five yards below the ford proper, to intercept, if possible, any article or person falling from or thrown by a blundering horse. Having myself been in the deepest water, although not the most rapid, and knowing that much depended on my firmness and care, my sense of personal danger was lost in anxiety for my precious charge; and I re-entered the perilous flood with the girls with something like a determination, if necessary, to save their lives rather than my own. Several of these, from the first, utterly refused all assistance; and they now sat like queens chivalric age— seeming, occasionally, tiny boats trimmed with odd sails and tossing mid the foam, as their horses rose and sunk over the roughness of the rocky bottom! The other girls, shutting their eyes to avoid looking at the seeming dangers, and also to prevent swimming of the head, held the horn of the saddle with a tenacious grasp, and surrendered the horses to the guidance of the escorts. On reaching the middle of the river, here some eighty yards wide, the depth had, indeed, decreased to about two feet; but then the rocks being more, and larger and rougher, the current was raging among them—a miniature of the Niagara Rapids. Here was I seized with a momentary perplexity. By way of punishing the incipient cowardice, however, I checked my own horse and that of the trembling girl next me, and thus remaining, forced my eyes to survey the whole really terrific scene, and to contemplate a cataract of waters thundering in an unbroken sheet over a ledge of rocks thirty feet high, and a short distance above the ford. And having thus compelled myself in the very midst of the boiling sea, to endure its surges, we proceeded cautiously and leisurely, till with no other harm than a good wetting, especially to my boots and upwards, and a little palpitation of the heart, all came safe to land. And then the chattering! and how we magnified ourselves! The charges and denials too!—“Mary what makes you so pale?”—“Pshaw!—I'm not—I was not scared a bit!”—“Nor me neither—” “Ha! ha! ha!—you had your eyes shut all the time!”—“Oh! Mr. Carlton had I?” “Well”—said he—“we must not tell tales out of school: beside I was half afraid I should get scared myself.” “You! Mr. Carlton”—said Mr. B.—“well it may be so; but without flattery, you brought the girls over about as well as I could have done it myself—why, you were as cool as a woodsman.” “Well after that praise, Mr. Blank”—(for that is the name)—“I mean to set up for a real genuine Hoosier.” Reader! I did not deserve such praise: but as to being “cool,” there was no mistake—only think of the cold water in my boots and elsewhere! Inquiry was now made about the pony: and that was answered by a general “Haw! haw! haw! hoo! hoo! hoo! he! he! he!” and so through the six cases—and mingled with the exclamations “look! look!”—“down thare! down thare!” We of course looked; and about thirty yards below the landing, was pony, or rather pony's head, his body and tail being invisible; but whether hippopotamus like he walked on the bottom, or was actually swimming, was uncertain. But there he was; and, by the progression of his ears, he was manifestly making headway pretty fast towards our side; although ever and anon, by the sudden dousing of his ears, he had either plunged into water deeper than his expectation, or been momentarily upset by the current. By this time our two young gentlemen had got opposite to pony and were waiting to assist at his toilette on his emerging;—for his saddle and bridle, &amp;c., had been all brought over on a vacated steed. The three soon rejoining us, we all, in health and with grateful hearts and good spirits, were again dashing on, wild and independent Tartars, through our own loved forests. But before we could reach our quarters this night, Nut Creek was to be passed, too deep to be forded, and having neither bridge nor scow! it was to be done—by canoe! and travelling by the canoe line has very little amusement, although abundance of danger and trouble and excitement. The canoe, in the present case, was a log ten feet long and eighteen inches wide and hacked, burned, and scraped, to the depth of a foot: and it was tolerably well rounded to a point at each end, being however, destitute of keel or or rudder. It was indeed, wholly unlike any fairy skiff found in poetry or Scott's Novels, or in the engravings of annuals bound in cloth and gold and reposing on centre tables. Nor was it either classical or Indian. It differed from a bark-canoe as a wooden shoe from a black morocco slipper! Either nature, or a native, had begun a hog-trough to hold swill and be snouted: but its capacities proving better than expectation—a little extra labour had chopped the thing into a log-boat! Well—into this metamorphosed log was now to be packed a most precious load. To one end went first, Mr. Blank, senr. with a paddle; then were handed along, one by one, the trembling girls, who sitting instantly on the bottom of the trough and closing their eyes, held to its sides with hands clenched as for life; and then followed Mr. C. filling up the few inches of remaining space, and for the first time in his days holding a canoe paddle! and then at the cry “let go!” our two junior gentlemen on the bank relaxed their hands and our laden craft was at the mercy of the flood! Many a boat had I rowed on the Delaware and the Schuylkill,—often a skiff on the Ohio,—ay! and poled and set over many a scow: but what avail that civilized practice, in propelling for the first time in one's life a hollow log, and with a small paddle like a large mush stick?—and across a raging torrent in a gloomy wilderness? Was it so wonderful my end went round?—and more than once! Could I help it? Was it even a wonder I looked solema? —grew dizzy?—and at last quit paddling altogether? But it was a wonder I did not upset that vile swine thing, and plunge all into the water—perhaps into death! and yet we all reached, by the skill of Mr. Blank, our port in safety. The horses in the meanwhile had been stripped, and three or four trustworthy ones released from their bridles to swim over by themselves; and so we made ready to ferry over the remaining animals and all the baggage, not, indeed at one, but several trips. The trust-worthy and more sensible creatures were led by the mane, or the nose, or driven with switches, and pelted with clods to the edge of the creek; where they were partly coaxed, and partly pushed into the flood, whence rising from the plunge, they swam snorting to the far side, and landing, continued cropping about till wanted. The less accommodating creatures were one at a time managed thus: Mr. Blank, senr. took a station at that end of the canoe, which when dragged round by the horse would become the stern, to guide and steer; and Mr. C. twice, and Mr. Frank and young Blank each once, was seated in the prow that was to be, and held the rope or bridle attached at the other end to the horse's head: then, all ready, the creature pulled by the person in the canoe and pelted, beat, slapped and pushed by the two on land took the “shoote;”—in this case a plunge direct over head and ears into water a little over nine feet deep! If this did not drag under or upset the log, that was owing to the—(hem!) dexterity and presence of mind and so forth, of the steersman—and the man at the bridle end! But when the animal arose and began to snort and swim ahead!—oh! sirs, then was realized and enjoyed all ever fabled about Neptune and his dolphins! or Davy Crockett and his alligators! What if you have a qualm at first!—that is soon lost in the excitement of this demi-god sailing! It is even grand! to cross a perilous flood on a log harnessed to a river horse! and with the rapidity of a comet, and the whirl and splash of a steamer! No wonder our Western people do often feel contempt for the tender nurslings of the east! And is it not likely that the fables about sea-cars, and water-gods, originated when men lived in the woods, dieted on acorns, and recreated themselves with this horse and log navigation? The hint may be worth something to the editors of Tooke's Pantheon. In an hour and a half we reached our second night's lodging place; and next day, at noon, the girls being committed to the junior gentlemen to escort to Sugartown, the residence of Mr. Blank, he and the author took the episodial journey, described in the following chapter. CHAPTER XLV. “Shaking his trident, urges on his steeds, Who with two feet beat from their brawny breasts The foaming billow; but their hinder parts Swim, and go smooth against the curling surge.” We parted from our young folks, at an obscure trace, leading Mr. B. and Mr. C. away to the left towards Big Possum Creek; along which, somewhere in the woods, Mr. Blank expected to meet an ecclesiastical body, of which he was a member. The spot was found late that night; but as yet no delegates had appeared, and when next day at three o'clock, P.M. a single clergyman appeared, jaded and muddy, and reported the waters as too high for members in certain directions to come at all, the whole affair was postponed till the subsidence of the flood; or, it was adjourned till dry weather! Mr. Blank being an officer of the general government, and having important matters demanding his immediate attention, now took me aside, and began as follows:— “Mr. Carlton, do you want to try a little more backwood's life?” “Why?” “Because, if possible, I should like to reach my house to-night.” “To-night!!—why 'tis half-past three! and your house is at least thirty-five miles—” “Yes, by the trace, up Big Possum—but in a straight line through the woods 'tis not over twenty-five miles.” “But there is no road?” “I don't want any; the sun is bright, and by sun-down, we shall strike a new road laid out last fall; and that I can follow in the night.” “I have never, Mr. B. swum a horse; and I confess I'm a leetle timid; and we cannot expect even canoes where there are no settlements—” “Oh! never fear, I'll go ahead; beside, Big Possum is all that is very seriously in the way; and I think it will hardly swim us now—come, what do you say—will you go?” “Well—let's see; twenty-five miles—no road, no settlement, won't quite swim, maybe—new road in the dark— pretty fair for a tyro, Mr. Blank; but I can't learn sooner; I'll go, sir—let us be off at once then.” Our friends expressed some surprise, and used some dehortation; but the bold, energetic, and cautious character of Mr. B. was well known, and hence no great fears were either expressed or felt for our safety. Accordingly, after a hasty kind of dinner-supper, we were mounted, and started away in the fashion of boys' foot races, prefaced by the formula—“are you saddled?—are you bridled??—whip!—start!—and Go-o!!” Big Possum was soon reached; and as there was no ford established by law or custom, it was to be forded at a venture. My friend sought, indeed, not for a place less deep apparently, but for one less impeded by bushes and briars, and then in he plunged, “accoutred as he was, and bade me follow.” And so, indeed, I did boldly, and promptly; for my courage was really so modest as to need the stimulus of a blind and reckless conduct. Hence, all I knew was a “powerful heap” of water in my boots again, and an uneasy wet sensation in the saddle-seat[21] [21] I hope the Magazines won't be hard on the grammar here—it is so great a help to our delicacy—a double intender like. —with a curious sinking of the horses “hinder parts,” as if he kicked at something and could not hit it—and then a hard scramble of his fore legs in the treacherous mud of a bank; and then this outery of Mr. Blank, as he turned an instant in his saddle to watch my emersion:— “Well done! Carlton! well done! You'll be a woodsman yet! Come, keep up—the worst is over.” Reader! I do think praise is the most magical thing in nature! In this case it nearly dried my inexpressibles! And on I followed, consoling myself for the other water in the boots, by singing—“possum up a gum tree!” “Hulloo! Mr. B. how are you steering? by the moss?” “No—by the shadows.” “Shadows! how's that?” “Our course is almost North East—the sun is nearly West—so cutting the shadows of the trees at the present angle, we'll strike the road, this rate, about sun-set.” I had travelled by the moss, a good general guide, the north and north-west sides of trees, having more and darker moss than the others; I had gone by a compass in a watch key-by blazes—by the under side of leaves recently upturned, a true Indian trace, as visible to the practiced eye as the warm scent to a hound's nose—and by the sun, moon, or stars; I had, in dark days, gone with comrades, who by keeping some fifty yards apart in a line, could correct aberrations; but never had I thought of our present simple and infallible guide! Man maybe, as some think, very low in the intellectual scale, and yet he has one mark of divine resemblance—he always is in search of simple agents and means, and when found, he uses them in producing the greatest effects. Witness here man's contrivances for navigating through the air and the waters, and for crossing deserts and solitudes! Laugh if you will, but I do confess that as we bounded along Vol. II.—6 that beautiful sunny afternoon and evening, I felt how like gods we availed ourselves of reason, in that wilderness without squatters, without blazes, without dry leaves, having no compass, and indifferent to moss; ay, and I smiled at the grim trees, while we cut athwart their black shadows at the proper angle, and heard from den and ravine and cliff the startled echoes crying out in amazement, in answering clatter and clang of hoofs and clamour of human voices! For many miles the land was low and level, and mostly covered with water in successive pools, seeming, at a short distance, like parts of one immense lake of the woods! These pools were rarely more than a few inches deep, unless in cavities where trees had been torn up by their roots, and such holes were easily avoided by riding around the prostrate tops. My friend had not expected quite so much water; for he now called out at intervals— “Come on! Carlton! we mustn't be caught here in the dark—the sun's getting low—can you keep up?” “Ay—ay!—go on!—go on!” And then, after every such exhortation and reply, as if all past trotting had been walking, away, away we splashed, not kicking up a dust, but a mimic shower of aqueous particles, and many a smart sprinkle of mud, that rattled like hail on the leaves above, and the backs and shoulders below! Never did I believe how a horse can go!—at least through mud and water! True, I did often think of “the merciful man, merciful to his beast”—but I thought in answer, that hay and oats were as scarce in the swamp as hog and hominy; and hence, that for all our sakes we had better bestir matters a little extra for an hour or two, that all might get to “entertainment for man and horse.” Hence, finally, we gave up all talking, singing, humming, and whistling, and all conjecturing and wishing; and set in to plain, unostentatious hard riding, kicking and whipping, our respective “critturs” so heartily as to leave no doubt somewhere under their hides, of our earnestness and haste; and, therefore, about half an hour after sunset, we gained or struck the expected road, where, although not yet free from the waters, we had no more apprehension of losing the course. This road was, in truth, a new new road; and not like some new new roads, new theatres and so forth that have had a patent for immortality and been fresh with youth for half a century[22] [22] However, new books now-a-days are exempt from the remark— being no more than literary fungi. Our fathers liked state new things —the sons prefer new things that have a smell and die. And, happily, our road had never been cut up by a wagon, being only an opening twelve yards wide, full of stumps, and for a few miles a-head, full of water. Without a fixed purpose, therefore, we could not wander from the partially illuminated and comparatively unimpeded way; and hence twilight as it was, on we splattered and splashed in all the glory and plenitude of mudhail, and dirt-coloured rain. At last we re-entered the dry world—a high and rolling country. As it was, however, then profoundly dark, our concluding five miles were done in a walk, slow, solemn, and funereal; till at half past ten o'clock that night we dismounted or disembarked, wet, weary, and hungry, at Mr. B.'s door: and there we were more than welcomed by his family, and all our boys and girls snug and safe from the late perils of woods and waters. CHAPTER XLVI. “Slowly and sadly we laid him down From the field of his fame, fresh and gory; We carved not a line, we raised not a stone, But we left him alone with his glory.” At the end of a week's visit we left Sugartown for Tippecanoe: but with a very diminished party. It consisted of one young lady only, the two young gentlemen, myself, and other four, horses. The lady, Miss Charille, lived twenty-five miles to the north, and within ten miles of Tippecanoe. The young fellows accompanied out of gallantry, and to visit with me the field. Being in a hurry, I shall not say how, in fording and swimming Sweet Creek, my head became dizzy, till my horse seemed to rush side ways up the stream—and how, spite of all practice and contrary resolutions, I felt sick and let down my limbs into the water, while Mr. B., who came to see us safe over, kept crying out, “Stick to your horse— don't look at the water—look at the bank!” Nor shall I tell how, in crossing a prairie, we saw, oh! I don't know how many deer!—nor how we started up prairie fowls, hens and roosters, and wished we had guns!—yes, and saw prairie wolves too, a cantering from us over the plain! And I shall not narrate how, in crossing one wet prairie, we were decoyed by some pretty, rich, green grass, into a morass!—and how Miss Charille's horse stuck fast, and struggling, pitched her into the mire!—and how she was more scared than hurt, and worse muddied than either! I should like to tell about the tall grass in places, but I hasten to say, that early in the evening we arrived at Mr. Charille's; that we were cordially received; that we got supper in due season, and then went to bed in western style, all in one room: the beds here nearly touching in places, but ingeniously separated by extemporary curtains of frocks and petticoats, and on a side of my bed, by two pairs of modest and respectable corduroy breeches. Fastidious folks, that smell at essences and flourish perfumed cambric, I know would have laid awake, curling their noses at the articles, but sensible ones in such cases go quietly to sleep; while men of genius are even captivated with the romance. `Romance!—what, a curtain of corduroy thinging-bobs?' Yes, corduroy breeches modestly hung as wall between ladies and gentlemen, reposing amid the solemn vastness of a prairie! If that is not romance, pray what is? To sleep alone in a plastered chamber, with a lock on the door, blinds to the windows, wash-stand, toilette, and so on, is very comfortable—very civilized—but surely not very romantic. And if strangeness is a constituent of romance, could any fix and fixtures be contrived stranger than ours? However, like a sensible body, I went soon and quietly to sleep, and was quickly in spirit lost in the land of shadows and dreams: and having a fine capacity for dreaming, I had many visions, till at last came one of my pet dreams —a winged dream! Then, lifted on pinions fastened some where about me, I went sailing in the air over the wide expanse of the meadow world; then, careering in a black tempest and hurricane, far above the bowing and crashing trees of the forest—and then suddenly descending near a mighty swollen river, I was deprived in some mysterious way of the wings! Here I lay stretched on a bed, while the form of that venerable quadruped, my dear nameless old friend, a little larger than life, backed up and became harnessed to the foot of the couch, and the dwarf pony began with his hinder parts to push against the head-board, and I was just a-launching into the waters, when down dropped both the steeds, and commenced to snort with so tremendous a tempest of noise as to wake me! I rubbed my eyes and smiled—but is it possible?—hark!—am I still dreaming? What is that beyond the corduroys in the adjoining bed? Dear, oh dear! can that be Dr. Charille snoring? During the week spent at Mr. Blank's his lady had once said to me,— “Mr. Carlton, you will not sleep any at Dr. Charille's.” “Not sleep any—why?” “His snoring will keep you awake.” “Never fear—I can sleep in a thunder storm.” “So I thought. But when lately he visited here, he insisting on sleeping alone in the passage, which we not permitting, when his snoring began, sure enough, as he himself pleasantly predicted, nobody else could sleep.” This conversation now recurred, when that amazing snoring formed and then destroyed my dream! What a relief, if young Mr. Frank and I, who slept together, could have laughed! One might have ventured, indeed, with impunity, during any paroxysm of snoring, if one could have quit when it subsided; for the most honest cachination must have been unheard in the uproar of the Doctor's nasal trumpetings. How shall we so write as to give any correct idea of the performance? Pitiful, indeed, it began, like a puppy's whine; but directly its tone passed into an abrupt, snappish, mischievous, and wicked snort; and then into a frightful tornado of windy sleep; after which, in a few minutes, it subsided, and suddenly ceased, as if the doctor had made a successful snap and swallowed it! If this description be not satisfactory, I hope the reader will send for Robert Dale Owen, who, knowing how to represent morals and circumstances by diagrams, may succeed in the same way at setting forth snoring; but such is beyond our power. The doctor evidently worked by the job, from his earnestness and haste: and certainly he did do, in any five minutes of a paroxysm, vastly more and better than all of us combined could have done the whole night. Happily any sound, regularly repeated, becomes a lullaby; and hence he that had snored me awake, snored me asleep again; but never can I forget that amazing, startling, and exhilatory nasal solo! That nose could have done snoring parts in a somnambula, and would have roused up the drowsy hearers better than the clash of brass instruments! After an ealy breakfast, the two youngsters and myself set off on horse-back for Tippecanoe; intending, as the field was only ten miles, to return, if possible, in the evening to Dr. Charille's. The day was favorable, and our path led usually through prairies, where awe is felt at the grandeur of the wild plains stretching away, sometimes with undulations, but oftener with unbroken smoothness, to meet the dim horizon. Yet one is frequently surprised and delighted there, with views of picturesque meadows, fringed with thickets intervening, and separating the primitive pasturages as in the golden age! The green and flowery meads seemed made for flocks and herds: and imagination easily created, under the shade of trees, shepherds and shepherdesses, with crooks and sylvan reeds! It heard the sound of pipes!— the very tones of thrilling and strange voices! Then we seemed to approach a country of modern farms, where the gopher hills resembled hay-cocks awaiting the wagon! and countless wild plums laden with rich and fragrant fruit recalled the Eastern orchards! Alas! our inconsistency! then I, who a while since looked with rapture to the sun-set and longed for the West, now looked to the sun-rise and sighed for the East—the far East! And why not? There was the home of my orphan boyhood! there had I revelled, and without care, in the generous toils of the harvest!—the binding of sheaves!—the raking of hay!—the hay-mow!—the stack-yard! There had I snared rabbits—trapped muskrats—found hens' nests—laid up walnuts and shell-barks! Ay! there had I fished with pinhooks, and caught in a little, dark, modest brook, more roach and gudgeon than the fellow with his store hook with a barbed point! And then the sliding down hills of ice on our own home-made sleds!—and upsetting!—and rolling to the bottom! Yes! yes! after all, those were the halcyon days! And so for a time how keen that morning the pangs of a desolate heart as I realized the immense solitudes around me! We had been directed to cross the river at a new town, which, on reaching, was found to contain one log-house half finished, and one tent belonging to a Canadian Frenchman, and some Indians. And yet, before we left the New Purchase, this Sproutsburgh had become a village to be seen from a distance, and not many years after contained fourteen retail stores!—a specimen of our wholesale growth in the West. But to me an object of great interest was a tall young Indian, dressed in a composite mode, partly barbarian, partly civilized. His pantaloons were of blue cloth, and he wore a roundabout of the same; while his small feet were tastefully clad with sumptuously wrought moccasins, and his head encircled with a woollen or ram-beaver hat, banded with a broad tin belt, and garnished with a cockade! He was seemingly about eighteen years old; and by way of favour he consented to ferry us over the water. And now, reader, here hast thou a fair token that this work is true as—most history; and not more extravagant than our puerile school histories for beginners:[23] [23] The present age is that of beginnings. Hence school-books are usually all for beginners; and it requires a wheel-barrow for a scholar now instead of a satchel. Things are also ended and finished but not continued and done. I resist the temptation of having ourselves skiffed over in a bark canoe! For, alas! we crossed in an ugly scow, and it moved by a pole! Yet was it nothing, as I held my horse, to look on that half reclaimed son of the forest, while he urged our rude flat-boat across the tumultuating waters of a river with an Indian name—Wabash! and we on our way to an Indian battle field—Tippecanoe! On the far bank we galloped into one of many narrow traces along the river, and running through mazy thickets of undergrowth; and shortly, spite of our many directions and cautions, quite as bepuzzling as the paths themselves, we were lost; having followed some deer or turkey trail till it miraculously disappeared, the animal being there used to jump off, or the bird to fly up! Then, and on like occasions, we put in towards the river, and when in sight or hearing of its waters, sometimes without, and sometimes with a “blind path,” we kept up stream the best we could. A blind path has that name because it tries the eyes and often requires spectacles to find it; or because one is in constant jeopardy of having the eyes blinded or struck out by unceremonious limbs, bushes, branches, and sprays. Recent high water had formed many extemporary lagoons, beyous and quagmires, which forced us often away from the river bank, that we might get round these sullen and melancholy lakes; although, after all our extra riding, we commonly appeared to have gone farther and fared worse; and hence, at last, we crossed wherever the impediment first offered. Once a muddy ravine presented itself; and as the difficulty seemed less than usual, we began our crossing with little or no circumspection,—and yet it was, truly, a most dangerous morass! Happily, we entered a few yards below the worst spot, and had creatures used to floundering through beds of treacherous and almost bottomless mire. 6* I had small space to notice my comrades, for my noble and spirited animal, finding in an instant the want of a solid spot, by instinct exerted her entire strength in a succession of leaps so sudden and violent as soon to displace the rider from the saddle; and when she gained terra firma, that rider was on her neck instead of back. A leap more would have freed her neck of the incumbrance, and our author would have either sunk or have done his own floundering. He stuck to the neck, not by skill, but for want of sufficient time to fall off! Having now opportunity to look round, we saw one young gentleman wiping the mud from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth—proof that all his senses had been open; and the other we saw stand, indeed, but very much like a man that had dismounted hastily and not altogether purposely,—he was on all fours! The three horses were sorely panting and trembling; while the bosom of the quagmire was regaining its placidity after the late unusual agitation, and in a few moments had become calm and deceitful as policy itself when for the people it has sacrificed its friends! And yet, where we had crossed, the mire after all was not so rery deep—it did not, we were told, average more than five feet! But, two rods above and one below, the quaggery required a pole to touch its bottom some fifteen feet long! And this we ascertained by trial, and also from the squatter, at whose cabin we halted a moment, just one mile below—the Field. Our windings, however, brought us to a sight mournful and solemn—a coffin in which rested an Indian babe! This rude coffin was supported in the crotch of a large tree, and secured from being displaced by the wind, being only a rough trough dug out with a tomahawk, and in which was deposited the little one, and having another similar trough bound down over the body with strips of papaw. Sad seemed the dreamless sleep of the poor innocent so separate from the graves of its fathers and the children of its people! Mournful the voice of leaves whispering over the dead in that sacred tree! The rattling of naked branches there in the hoarse winds of winter!—how desolate! And yet if one after death could lie amid thick and spicy ever-green branches near the dear friends left—instead of being locked in the damp vault! or trodden like clay in the deep, deep grave! But would that be rebellion against the sentence “dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return?”—then let our bodies be laid in the silence and the dark till the morning and the life! See! what woodland is that yonder? That advanced like the apex of a triangle; and yet as we now approach nearer and nearer, is rising up and has become an elevated plain? That is Tippecanoe! Yes! this is Tippecanoe, as it stood some twelve years after the battle!—Tippecanoe in its primitive and sacred wilderness! unscathed by the axe, unshorn by the scythe, unmarked by roads, unfenced! We are standing and walking among the slain warriors! Can it be that I am he, who but yesterday was roused from sleep to aid in “setting up the declaration of war against Great Britain,” to appear as an extra sheet? and who, each subsequent week, thrilled as I “composed” in the “iron stick” accounts of battles by land and fights at sea?—in the days of Maxwell rollers and Ramage presses!—and hardy pressmen in paper aprons and cloth trousers!—long before the invasion of petticoats and check aprons! Oh! ye men and boys of ink and long primer! how our spirits were stirred to phrensy and swelled with burnings and longings after fame!—while, like trumpeters calling to battle, we scattered forth our papers that woke up the souls of men! Then I heard of Harrison and Tippecanoe; and dreamed even by day of a majestic soldier seated on his charger, and his drawn sword flashing its lightnings, and his voice swelling over the din of battle like the blast of the clarion!—and of painted warriors, like demons, rushing with the knife and tomahawk upon the white tents away, away off somewhere in the unknown wilds,—of “shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke, and death-shots falling thick and fast as lightning from the mountain cloud!”—And do I stand, and without a dream look on—Tippecanoe? Even so!—for see, here mouldering are trunks of trees that formed the hasty rampart!—here the scars and seams in the trees torn by balls!—ay! here in this narrow circle are skeletons of, let me count again, yes, of fourteen war-horses! But where the riders? Here, under this beech —see, the record in the bark!—we stand on the earth over the dead—“rider and horse—friend—foe—in one red burial blent!” What is this?—the iron band of a musket! See! I have found a rusty bayonet! Was it ever wet with blood? Perhaps it belonged to the brave soul about whom the squatter gave us the following anecdote: “A party of United States regulars were stationed there, and with strict orders for none to leave ranks. An Indian crawled behind this large log—its pretty rotten now you see—and here loading and firing he killed four or five of us; while we daresn't quit ranks and kill him. But one of our chaps said to the nearest officer—`Leftenint! for Heaven's sake—gimme leaf to kill that red devil ahind the log—I'll be in ranks agin in a minute!' `My brave fellow'—said the officer, `I darn't give you leave—I musn't see you go.' And with that he walked off akeepin his back towards us; and, when he turned and got back, our soldier was in ranks; but, gentlemen, his bagnit was bloody, and a deep groan from behind this here old log, told the officer that the bagnit had silenced the rifle and avenged the fall of our messmates and comrades.” If the reader imagine a strip of woodland, triangular in form, its point or apex jutting a kind of promontory into the prairie whose long grass undulates like the waving of an inland sea; if on one side of this woody isle, he imagines a streamlet about fifteen feet below and stealing along through the grass; and on the other side, here, a mile, and there, two miles across the prairie, other woodlands hiding in their darkness the Wabash; and if he imagines that river, at intervals gleaming in the meadow, like illuminated parts merely of the grass-lake, he may picture for himself something like Tippecanoe in the simplicity of “uncurled”[24] [24] Hemans. nature, and before it was marred and desecrated by man's transformations! The first intimation of the coming battle, as our squatter who was in it, said, was from the waving grass. A sentinel hid that night in the darkness of the wood, was gazing in a kind of dreamy watchfulness over the prairie, admiring, as many times before, the beauteous waving of its hazy bosom. But never had it seemed so strangely agitated; —a narrow and strong current was setting rapidly towards his post; and yet no violent wind to give the stream that direction! He became first, curious— soon, suspicious. Still nothing like danger appeared—no voice,—no sound of footsteps,—no whisper! Yet rapidly and steadily onward sets the current—its first ripples are breaking at his feet! He awakes all his senses;—but discovers nothing —he strains his eyes over the top of the bending grass— and then, happy thought! he kneels on the earth and looks intently below that grass! Then, indeed, he saw, not a wind moved current—but Indian warriors in a stooping posture and stealing noiseless towards his post—a fatal and treacherous under current in that waving grass! The sentinel springing to his feet cried out, “Who comes there?” “Pottawatamie!”—the answer, as an Indian leaped with a yell from the grass, and almost in contact with the soldier—and then, fell back with a death scream as the ball of the sentinel's piece entered the warrior's heart, and gave thus the signal for combat! Our men may have slumbered; for it was a time of treaty and truce—but it was in armour they lay, and with ready weapons in their bands; and it was to this precaution of their general, we owed the speedy defeat of the Indians; although not before they had killed about seventy of our little army. No one can properly describe the horrors of that night attack—at least, I shall not attempt it. It required the coolness and deliberation, and at the same time, the almost reckless daring and chivalric behaviour of the commander and his noble officers and associates, to foil such a foe, and at such a time; even with the loss of so many brave men of their small number. That the foe was defeated and driven off is proof enough to Western men—(if not to Eastern politicians who do battles on paper plains)—that all was anticipated and done by Harrison that was necessary. It would not become a work like this, which inexperienced folks may not think is quite as true as other histories, to meddle with the history of an honest President; but the writer knows, and on the best authority, that General Harrison did that night all that a wise, brave, and benevolent soldier ought to do or could do; and among other things, that his person was exposed in the fiercest and bloodiest fights where balls repeatedly passed through his clothes and his cap. There was, however, one in the battle so generous, so chivalric, so kind, and yet so eccentric, that his life would make a volume of truth more exciting than fiction—the celebrated Joseph Hamilton Davies, familiarly and kindly called in the West, Joe Daris. A lawyer by profession, he was eminent in all pertaining to his science and art; but pre-eminent in the adjustment of land claims. An anecdote about him on this point appeared in the newspapers some years since; it deserves a more imperishable record in a work destined to be read and preserved in so many families—maybe! A person, served with an ejectment, and fearing from the length of his adversary's purse, that he must be unjustly deprived of his lands, came from a great distance to solicit the aid of Davies. He succeeded in his application, and was dismissed with an assurance that, in due season, the lawyer would appear for his client and prevent his being dispossessed. The arena of contest was, as has been intimated, distant; and hence Davies was in person a stranger to the members of that court, or so imperfectly known that an uncanonical dress would be an effectual concealment. His client's case being duly called, matters by the opposite party were set in such a light that a verdict from the jury, and a decision from the bench, in favour of the plaintiff seemed inevitable; yet, for form's sake, the defendant must be heard. The poor client had relied so entirely on Davies, and had felt so certain of being secured in his possessions, as to have neglected to obtain any other legal aid—and still, at this critical moment when he was to be summoned for his defence—Davies had not arrived! Nay!—while earnestly straining his eyes, the client was even rudely jostled by a rough chap in hunting shirt and leather breeches, who carrying a heavy rifle in his hand and with a racoon-skin cap slouched over his face, kept squeezing very impudentdently even among the laughing and good natured lawyers inside the bar; where, to everybody's diversion, he appropriated to himself a seat with the most simple and awkward naivete possible; but what diversion was all this to our client looking round in despair for his lawyer! And then when the judge asked who appeared for the defendant, what amazement must have mingled with the client's despair when at the call up rose that rude hunter and replied: “I do, please your honour!” “You!”—replied his honor—“who are you, sir?” “Joseph Hamilton Davies, please your honor!” And now, after that heavy rifle was slowly placed in a snug corner of the bar, and that skin cap was removed from the head, plain enough was it that the noble face, no longer concealed, was his; the talented, the philanthropic, the eccentric Joe Davis. Never before had so much law been cased in a hunting shirt and buckskins; and never before nor since, was, or has been, a difficult cause in such a guise pleaded so triumphantly: for the entire superstructure of the opposite argument was completely subverted and a verdict and decision, in proper time, rendered for the defendant, when to all appearance it had been virtually made, if not formally declared, for his antagonist. Alas! noble heart! and here is thy very grave! Yes, “J. H. D.” is here in the bark—my finger is in the rude graving!—and now at the root of the tree I am seated making my notes! The last the squatter ever saw of Joe Davies alive, was when his grey horse was plunging in the furious charge down this hill—when the sentinel, already named, had fired and called “to arms!” And the next day our guide helped to lay Davies in this grave; and saw his name transferred to the living monument here sheltering and fanning his sepulchre! We lingered at Tippecanoe till the latest possible moment!—there was, in the wildness of the battle-field—in my intimate acquaintance with some of its actors—in the living trees, scarred and hacked with bullet and hatchet, and marked with names of the dead—in the wind so sad and melancholy—something so like embodied trances, that I wandered the field all over, here standing on a grave, there resting on a decaying bulwark; now counting the scars of trees, now the skeleton heads of horses; finding in one spot a remnant of some iron weapon, in another, the bones of a slain soldier dragged, perhaps, by wild beasts from his shallow grave!—till my young comrades insisted on our return if we expected to reach our friend's house before the darkness of night. Having, accordingly, deposited in my valisse a few relics and mementos, we rode down the hill into the prairie, at the spot poor Davies was seen descending and leading a charge; and over the very ground where the grassy current had betrayed the dangerous under-tide of painted foes. Hence we crossed over to the town whence the Indians issued for the attack, and where the wily prophet himself remained in safety, concocting charms against the white man's weapons! After this, we turned down the Wabash, keeping our eyes ever directed towards the mournful island of wood, till at last we doubled its cape, and lost sight of Tippecanoe for ever! That field, however, and its hero of North Bend are immortal. BATTLE OF TIPPECANOE. Within the shelter of the primal wood, An isle amid the prairie's flow'ry sea, Upon his midnight watch, our sentry stood, Guarding the slumbers of the brave and free; And o'er the swellings of a seeming tide, Dim sparkling in the moonlight's silv'ry haze, The soldier oft, distrustful, far and wide, Sent searching looks, or fixed his steadfast gaze. Long had he watch'd; and still each grassy wave Brought nought save perfumes to the tented isle; Nor sign of foe the fragrant breezes gave; Till thoughts of cabin-home his sense beguile, Far from the wilds: for yet, though fix'd intent, As if his eyes discerned a coming host, Those moisten'd eyes are on his lov'd ones bent— He sleeps not; but the dreams upon his post. Soldier! what current like a hast'ning stream, Outstrips the flowing of you lagging waves? Shake off the fetters of thy fatal dream! Quick! save thy comrades from their bloody graves! He starts!—he marks the prairie's bosom shake! He sees that current to the woodland near! He kneels—upleaps and cries—“Comrades, awake! To arms! to arms!—the treach'rous foe is here!” “Like mountain torrent, furious gushing, The warrior tribe is on us rushing,— With weapons in their red hands gleaming, And charmed banners from them streaming! To arms! to arms! ye slumb'ring brave! To arms!—your lives and honor save!” Arm'd, from the earth, our host is springing; Their sabres forth from sheaths are ringing; Their chargers mounted, fierce are prancing; Their serried bay'nets swift advancing:— “Quick, to your posts!” the general's cry, Answer'd, “We're there, to do or die!” Hand to hand, within that solemn wood, For life, fought warriors true and good! The hatchet through the brain went crushing! The bay'net brought the heart blood gushing! On arrows' feather'd wings death went, Or swift, at the rifle flash, was sent, Till victor shouts the air was rending, And groans the wounded forth were sending! “Charge! soldiers, charge!” brave Davies shouted; They charg'd; the yelling foe was routed;— Yet long before that foe was flying, That hero, on the plain, was dying! That prairie lake rolls peaceful waves no more; Its bosom rages 'neath a tempest pow'r— See! driven midst it, from the woodland shore, Fierce bands rush vanquish'd from a deadly show'r! And gleaming steel, and lead and iron hail Pour vengeful out of war's dark sky, 'Mid shriek, and fright, and groan, and dying wail, And triumph's voice, “Charge home! they fly!” Solemn the pomp where mourning heroes tread With arms revers'd, and measur'd step, and slow! Sadly, yet proud, is borne their comrade dead, Their warlike ensigns bound with badge of woe! Sublime, though plaintive, pours the clarion's tone! The heart, while bow'd, is stirred by muffled drum! But stand within that far-off wild wood lone, Where Prairie scented winds, with dirges, come, Where the rough bark, rude grav'd with hunter's knife, Points to the spot where Davies rests below, And relics scatter'd, tell of bloodiest strife— Heart gushing tears from dimming eyes must flow! And round thy mournful bier, our warrior sage; Who rushing reckless to each fiercest fight, Didst fall a victim to no foeman's rage Amid the camage of that fearful night, A nation, yet, in tears, has smitten stood Grieving o'er thee with loud and bitter cry! Rest thee, our hero of that island wood! Worthy in thine own ransom'd West to lie! When floating down Ohio's grand old wave, Our eyes shall turn to where his forests stand, Stretching dark branches o'er our chieftain's grave— Father and saviour of the Western's land! CHAPTER XLVII. “For now I stand as one upon a rock Environed with a wilderness of sea.” Late at night we arrived safe at Dr. Charille's. The next day we set out for Woodville, choosing on the return other paths, to avoid former difficulties and dangers; by which prudence, however, we only reversed matters; for instance, instead of water before a swamp, we got the swamp before the water. And, also, we thus often set out before day-light in the dark, instead of travelling in the dark after day-light—travelling occasionally to reach a settlement in the dark at both ends of the day. Besides our new route threw us away up Nut Creek, where, contrary to all expectation, it was found necessary either to swim below a mill-dam, or be canoed across above the dam. The latter was our choice; and as it afforded a pleasant variety in the horse and log navigation, we shall give the adventure and then skip all the way to Woodville. The whole plain[25] [25] Aequor is classic and poetic authority. of water to be crossed was about one hundred and twenty yards wide. But it consisted of three divisions, the Creek Proper, twenty yards wide and now eighteen feet deep; and two lagoons, each full, on opposite sides of the creek, and averaging each fifty yards in width, although in most places, the banks being low, the lagoons could not be distinguished from the creek, but the three divisions seemed one water, lake, or sea. Our transit spot was a place, where, from the edge of the hither lagoon could be discerned by a careful observer, a modest little grassy mound in the water, a kind of frog-island, which the miller said was the nearest bank of the creek; and that from this mound another on the opposite bank could be discovered, or nearly so. And nothing, he said, would be easier for us than first to ford over the lagoon to the nearest mound, where he would meet us in a canoe: that here we could strip our horses, and thence by turns every thing could be transported to the farther mound, whence, all matters re-arranged, we could ford the distant lagoon, and so come finally to the dry land on the opposite hill beyond the bottom. This certainly was plausible, if not captivating; especially should not the horses become entangled in the brush and vines, forming tolerable fish-nets under water, and should the lagoons be only four feet deep. They certainly looked, to judge from the surface water up the trunks of trees, somewhere about six feet deep; but then both the miller-man and his son were “right down sartin, it wan't more nor four feet no place, nor it moughn't be that deep, except in them 'are blasted holes!” Receiving ample direction for circumnavigating the holes aforesaid, we took aim for the first isle-of-bank, and were soon so well in for it, that the difficulty and peril of going backward and forward were equal; and therefore, we worked onward, tacking incessantly every way to avoid logs, trees, and vines, and in awe all the while of “them 'are holes,” till we began to rise once more in the world, and stood sublime in the very middle of Frog-land! Believe me, reader! it was not void of uneasiness, we thus sundered from the world, looked back on the woods just left, and standing partly in and partly out of the water! while, at our feet, and separated by a strip of grass, swept along in the pride and fury of risen waters, the creek itself, curling amply over a few inches of the still visible dam, and shaking and tearing away with its yet rising tide our little territory! And that canoe! a tiny log shell, to transport us to the other lagoon, where four feet water, logs, trees, vines and holes must be encountered again! How like the realms of Pluto! and we, how like terrified ghosts awaiting a passage across the Styx in the rickety bark of Charon! All ready, I attempted, bridle in hand, to step into the canoe, but by some awkwardness, I stumbled into the far end, and thus so violently jerked the rein, that my creature soused in, and descended almost the length of the bridle; but by the time she gave her first snortings, on regaining the air, our log was over, and the creature (i. e. equa) was pawing up the isle-of-bank number 2. Here we remained till Mr. Frank and his horse arrived, and a third trip had brought our saddles and baggage; and then, duly prepared, we forded lagoon the second, and in proper season gained our wished for hill, and — “What stuff!” “What stuff?” gentle reader, what better could you do with a mud and water subject?” “Yes—but what's the use of such things?” La! that's so like what Aunt Kitty said, when I got to Woodville, all dirty and tired—my new boots thick with exterior mud—my best coat altogether spoiled—my fur hat crushed into fancy shapes, and the seat of my corduroy inexpressibles abraded to the finest degree of tenuosity at all consistent with comfort and decorum! CHAPTER XLVIII. “And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them.” Vide on Ancient Record. “—Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himself:—if he be free, Why then, my taxing, like a wild goose flies, Unclaimed of any man.” On the last day of the return to Woodville, we met at intervals during the final half-dozen miles, not less than one dozen wagons, large and small, and partially loaded, some with beds and bedding, and some with culinary utensils; the interstices being filled with a wedging of human bodies—men, women, and children, some laughing and talking, others solemn and demure. They seemed at first view settlers, who, having sold to advantage old farms, were flitting to where wood and game were more abundant, and neighbours not crowded offensively under other's noses, as near as one or two miles. But soon appeared people riding once, twice, and even thrice on a horse; and some kind-hearted horses, like the nameless one, were carrying on their backs whole families; and then it was plain enough what was meant—a big meeting was to come off somewhere. And shortly all doubt was at an end, when familiar soprano and alto voices from under wagon covers, and out of scoop-shovelled bonnets came forth thus—“How'd do! Mr. Carlton?—come, won't you go to camp meetin?” And then sounded, from extra devotional parties and individuals, snatches of favourite religious songs, fixed to trumpet melodies, such as “Glory! glory, glory!”—“He's a coming, coming, coming!”—“Come, let us march on, march on, march on!” and the like; and the saintly voices were ever and anon oddly commingled with some very unsanctimonious laughing, not intended for irreverence, but not properly suppressed at some ill-timed joke in another quarter, related perhaps, yet more probably practiced. For nothing excels the fun and frolic, where two or three dozen half-tamed young gentlemen and ladies, mounted on spirited and mischievous horses set out together to attend a Mormon, a Shaking-quaker, or a Millery or a Camp-meeting. At the very edge of Woodville, too, there met us a comfortable looking middle-aged woman, who was riding a horse, and was without any bonnet; her other apparel being in some disorder, and her hair illy done up and barely restrained by a horn comb. She thus addressed me:— “I say, Mister, you haint seen nara bonnit?” “Bonnet!—no, ma'am; have you lost your bonnet?” “Yes—I've jist had a powerful exercise over thare in the Court-house; and when I kim to, I couldn't see my bonnit no whare about —” “Has there been meeting in the Court-house lately?” “Oh! Lord bless you, most powerful time—and it's there I've jist got religion—” “And lost your bonnet?” “Yes, sir,—but some said as it maybe mought a-gone on to camp with somebody's plunder: you didn't see or hear tell on it, did you?” “No, I did not; but had you really no power over your bonnet, ma'am?” “Well! now!—who ever heern of a body in a exercise a thinkin on a bonnit! Come, mister, you'd better turn round and go to camp and git religion yourself, I allow— thar's whar all the town a'most and all the settlemints round is agoin—but I'll have to whip up and look after my bonnit—good bye, mister!” And so all Woodville and its vicinities were in the ferment of departure for a camp-meeting! Now as this was to be a big meeting of the biggest size, and all the crack preachers within a circle of three hundred miles were to be present, and also a celebrated African exhorter from Kentucky; and as much was said about “these heaven-directed, and heaven-blessed, and heaven-approved campings;” and as I, by a constant refusal to attend heretofore, had become a suspected character, it being often said,— “yes,—Carlton's a honest sort of man, but why don't he go out to camp and git religion?”—I determined now to go. Why whole families should once or twice a year break up for two weeks; desert domestic altars; shut up regular churches; and take away children from school; why cook lots of food at extra trouble and with ill-bestowed expense; why rush to the woods and live in tents, with peril to health and very often ultimately with loss of life to feeble persons; why folks should do these and other things under a belief that the Christian God is a God of the woods and not of the towns, of the tents and not of the churches, of the same people in a large and disorderly crowd and not in one hundred separate and orderly congregations—why? why? I had in my simplicity repeatedly asked, and received for answer: “Oh! come and see! Only come to camp and git your cold heart warmed—come git religion—let it out with a shout—and you'll not axe them infidel sort of questions no more.” This was conclusive. And like the vicar of Wakefield, I resolved not always to be wise, but for once to float with a tide neither to be stemmed nor directed. A friend, learned in these spiritual affairs, advised me not to go till Saturday night, or so as to be on the ground by daylight on Sunday. This I did, and was handsomely rewarded by seeing and hearing some very extraordinary conversions—as far as they went; and also some wonderful scenes and outcries. Vol. II.—7 The camp was an old and favourite ground, eight miles from Woodville. It had been the theatre of many a spirit-stirring drama; and there, too, many a harvest of glory had been reaped in battling with “the devil and his legions.” Yet wonderful! his satanic majesty never became shy of a spot where he was said always to have the worst of the fight! and now it was commonly said and believed that a prodigious great contest was to come off; and “hell-defying” challenges had been given in some Woodville pulpits for Satan to come out and do his prettiest. Nay, by certain prophets that seemed to have the gift of discerning spirits, it was “allowed the ole boy was now out at camp[26] [26] Candour obliges me to say these “allowings” and predictions were true—the devil did seem to be out there in pretty great force. I cannot say so positively about his defeats. in great force—that some powerful fights would be seen, but that the ole fellow would agin and agin git the worst of it.” The camp proper was a parallelogramic clearing, and was most of the day shaded by the superb forest trees, which admitted, here and there, a little mellow sunshine to gleam through the dense foliage upon their own dark forms quivering in a kind of living shadow over the earth. At night, the camp was illuminated by lines of fires kindled and duly sustained on the tops of many altars and columns of stone and log-masonry—a truly noble and grand idea, peculiar to the West. Indeed, to the imaginative, there is very much to bewitch in the poetry and romance of a Western camp-meeting:—the wildness, the gloom, the grandeur of our forests—the gleaming sunlight by day, as if good spirits were smiling on the sons of light in their victories over the children of darkness—the clear blue sky like a dome over the tents—that dome, at night, radiant with golden stars, like glories of heaven streaming through the apertures of the concave! And the moon!—how like a spirit world, a residence of ransomed ones! The very tents, too!—formed like booths at the feast of tabernacles, and seeming to be full of joyous hearts—a community having all things common, dead to the world, just ready to enter heaven! And when the trumpet sounded for singing!—the enthusiastic performance of child-like tunes, poured from the hearts of two thousand raptured devotees, till the bosom of the wilderness trembles and rejoices while it rolls over its wooded hills and through its dark valleys the echo of the pæan with the peal of deep thunder and the roar of rushing whirlwinds! Under the direction of wise and talented men, a camp-meeting may possibly be a means of a little permanent good; but, with the best management, it is a doubtful means of much moral and spiritual good—nay, it cannot long be used in a cautious and sober way. In religion, as in all other affairs, where the main dependence is on expedients to reach the moral man through the fancy and imagination, what begins in poetry must soon end in prose. Nay, if a religious meeting be protracted beyond one or two days, novelties must be introduced; and such are invariably exciting and entertaining, but never spiritual and instructive; if not introduced, the meeting becomes, in the opinion of the majority, stale. Heat, and flame, and smoke, constitute, with most, “a good meeting.” Nay, again, and yea also, the final result of man-contrived means and measures is at war with true courtesy, uncensorious feelings, the cheerful discharge of daily secular duties, and the culture of the intellect. The whole is selfish in tendency and promotive of presumptuous confidence, and a contemptible self-righteousness. Adequate reasons enough may be assigned for the popularity of camp-meetings, and none of them essentially religious or even praise-worthy; although many essentially worthy and religious persons both advocate and attend such places; for instance, the love of variety and novelty—the desire of excitements—romantic feelings—tedium of common every-day life--love of good fellowship--and even a willingness to obtain a cheap religious character--and, also, a secret hope that we please God and merit heaven for so extraordinary and long-continued devotion. Add, our innate love of pageantry, inclining us not only to behold scenes but to make and be a part of scenes; for even in this sense—“All the world's a stage, and all the men and and women merely players.” A camp-meeting might, indeed, be reformed; and so might the theatre—but the one event is no more probable than the other: and as a reformed theatre would be little visited, so we apprehend would be a reformed camp-meeting. The respective abuses of both are essential to their existence. But this is digressing. The tents were in a measure permanent fixtures, the uprights and cross pieces remaining from season to season; but now all were garnished with fresh and green branches and coverings. These tents formed the sides of the parallelogram, intervals being left in suitable places for alleys and scaffolds; while in the woods were other more soldierly-looking tents of linen or canvass, and pitched in true war style; although not a few tents were mere squares of sheets, coverlets and table-cloths. Also for tents were up propped some twenty or thirty carts and wagons, and furnished with a chair or two, and some sort of sleeping apparatus. In the rear of the regular tents, and, indeed, of many others, were places and fixtures for kinding a fire and boiling water for coffee, tea, chocolate, &amp;c. &amp;c.—a few culinary operations being yet needed beyond the mountains of food brought from home ready for demolition. Indeed, a camp-meeting out there is the most mammoth pic-nic possible; and it is one's own fault, saint or sinner, if he gets not enough to eat, and that the best the land affords. It would be impossible even for churlish persons to be stingy in the open air; the ample sky above and the boundless woods around; the wings of gay birds flashing in sunshine, and the squirrels racing up gigantic trunks and barking and squeaking amid the grand branches; and what then must be the effect of all on the proverbially open-hearted native born Westerns? Ay! the native Corn-Cracker, Hoosier, Buckeye, and all men and women “born in a cane-brake and rocked in a sugar trough,”—all born to follow a trail and cock and old fashioned lock-rifle,—all such are openhearted, fearless, generous, chivalric, even in spite of much filth and scum and base leaven from foreign places. And hence, although no decided friend to camp-meetings, spiritually and morally and theologically considered, we do say that at a Western camp-meeting as at a barbecue, the very heart and soul of hospitality and kindness is wide open and poured freely forth. We can, maybe, equal it in here; but we never try.[27] [27] If folks like the “New Purchase,” we shall write “The Old Purchase”—in which work things in here will receive justice. Proceed we now to things spiritual. And first, we give notice that attention will be paid only to grand matters and that very many episodial things are omitted, such as incidental exhortations and prayers from authorized, as well as unauthorized folks, male and female, whose spirits often suddenly stirred, and not to be controlled like those of old-fashioned prophets, forced our friends to speak out, like quaker ladies and gentlemen in reformed meetings, and even when they have nothing to say; and also will be omitted all irregular outcries, groans, shouts, and bodily exercises, subordinate, indeed, to grand chorusses and contests, but otherwise beginning without adequate cause and ending in nothing. The camp was furnished with several stands for preaching, exhorting, jumping and jerking; but still one place was the pulpit above all others. This was a large scaffold secured between two noble sugar trees, and railed in to prevent from falling over in a swoon, or springing over in an ecstacy; its cover the dense foliage of the trees whose trunks formed the graceful and massive columns. Here was said to be also the altar—but I could not see its horns or any sacrifice; and the pen, which I did see—a place full of clean straw, where were put into fold stray sheep willing to return. It was at this pulpit, with its altar and pen, the regular preaching was done; around here the congregation assembled; hence orders were issued; here, happened the hardest fights and were gained the greatest victories, being the spot where it was understood Satan fought in person; and here could be seen gestures the most frantic, and heard noises the most unimaginable, and often the most appalling. It was the place, in short, where most crowded either with praise worthy intentions of getting some religion, or with unholy purposes of being amused; we of course designing neither one nor the other, but only to see philosophically and make up an opinion. At every grand outcry a simultaneous rush would, however, take place from all parts of the camp, proper and improper, towards the pulpit, altar, and pen; till the crowding, by increasing the suffocation and the fainting, would increase the tumult and the uproar; but this in the estimation of many devotees only rendered the meeting more lively and interesting. By considering what was done at this central station one may approximate the amount of spiritual labour done in a day, and then a week in the whole camp: 1. About day-break on Sabbath a horn blasted us up for public prayer and exhortation—the exercises continuing nearly two hours. 2. Before breakfast, another blast for family and private prayer; and then every tent became, in camp language, “a bethel of struggling Jacobs and prevailing Israels;” every tree “an altar;” and every grove “a secret closet;” till the air all became religious words and phrases, and vocal with “Amens.” 3. After a proper interval came a horn for the forenoon service; then was delivered the sermon, and that followed by an appendix of some half dozen exhortations let off right and left, and even behind the pulpit, that all might have a portion in due season. 4. We had private and secret prayer again before dinner;—some clambering into thick trees to be hid, but forgetting in their simplicity, that they were heard and betrayed. But religious devotion[28] [28] A man may make a fool of himself in worship in a Christian land, and be deemed a saint; when he does so in Pagan worship, we call him a sinner. Six of one and so forth. excuses all errors and mistakes. 5. The afternoon sermon with its bob-tail string of exhortations. 6. Private and family prayer about tea time. 7. But lastly, we had what was termed “a precious season” in the third regular service at the principia of the camp. This season began not long after tea and was kept up long after I left the ground; which was about midnight. And now sermon after sermon and exhortation after exhortation followed like shallow, foaming, roaring waters; till the speakers were exhausted and the assembly became an uneasy and billowy mass, now hushing to a sobbing quiescence, and now rousing by the groans of sinners and the triumphant cries of folks that had “jist got religion;” and then, again subsiding to a buzzy state occasioned by the whimpering and whining voices of persons giving spiritual advice and comfort! How like a volcanic crater after the evomition of its lava in a fit of burning cholic, and striving to re-settle its angry and tumultuating stomach! It is time, however, to speak of the three grand services and their concomitants, and to introduce several master spirits of the camp. Our first character, is the Reverend Elder Sprightly. This gentleman was of good natural parts; and in a better school of intellectual discipline and more fortunate circumstances, he must have become a worthy minister of some more tasteful, literary, and evangelical sect. As it was, he had only become, what he never got beyond—“a very smart man;” and his aim had become one—to enlarge his own people. And in this work, so great was his success, that, to use his own modest boastfulness in his sermon today,—“although folks said when he came to the Purchase that a single corn-crib would hold his people, yet, bless the Lord, they had kept spreading and spreading till all the corn-cribs in Egypt wern't big enough to hold them!” He was very happy at repartee, as Robert Dale Owen well knows; and not “slow” (inexpert) in the arts of “taking off”—and—“giving them their own.” This trait we shall illustrate by an instance. Mr. Sprightly was, by accident, once present where a Campbellite Baptist, that had recently taken out a right for administering six doses of lobelia, red pepper and steam, to men's bodies, and a plunge into cold water for the good of their souls, was holding forth against all Doctors, secular and sacred, and very fiercely against Sprightly's brotherhood. Doctor Lobelia's text was found somewhere in Pope Campbell's New Testament; as it suited the following discourse introduced with the usual inspired preface:— Doctor Lobelia's Sermon. “Well, I never rub'd my back agin a collige, nor git no sheepskin, and allow the Apostuls didn't nithur. Did anybody ever hear of Peter and Poll a-goin to them new-fangled places and gitten skins to preach by? No, sirs, I allow not; no sirs, we don't pretend to loguk—this here new testament's sheepskin enough for me. And don't Prisbeteruns and tother baby sprinklurs have reskorse to loguk and skins to show how them what's emerz'd didn't go down into the water and come up agin? And as to Sprightly's preachurs, don't they dress like big-bugs, and go ridin about the Purchis on hunder-dollur hossis, a-spunginin on poor priest-riden folks and and a-eaten fried chicken fixins so powerful fast that chickens has got skerse in these diggins; and them what ain't fried makes tracks and hides when they sees them a-comin? “But, dear bruthrun, we don't want store cloth and yaller buttins, and fat hosses and chickin fixins, and the like doins—no, sirs! we only wants your souls—we only wants beleevur's baptism—we wants prim—prim—yes, Apostul's Christianity, the christianity of Christ and them times, when Christians was Christians, and tuk up thare cross and went down into the water, and was buried in the gineine sort of baptism by emerzhin. That's all we wants; and I hope all's convinced that's the true way—and so let all come right out from among them and git beleevur's baptism; and so now if any brothur wants to say a word I'm done, and I'll make way for him to preach.” Anticipating this common invitation, our friend Sprightly, indignant at this unprovoked attack of Doctor Lobelia, had, in order to disguise himself, exchanged his clerical garb for a friend's blue coatee bedizzened with metal buttons; and also had erected a very tasteful and sharp coxcomb on his head, out of hair usually reposing sleek and quiet in the most saint-like decorum; and then, at the bid from the pulpit-stump, out stepped Mr. Sprightly from the opposite spice-wood grove, and advanced with a step so smirky and dandyish as to create universal amazement and whispered demands—“Why! who's that?!” And some of his very people, who were present, as they told me, did 7* not know their preacher till his clear, sharp voice, came upon the hearing, when they showed, by the sudden lifting of hands and eyebrows, how near they were to exclaiming—“Well! I never!!” Stepping on to the consecrated stump, our friend, without either preliminary hymn or prayer, commenced thus:— “My friends, I only intend to say a few words in answer to the pious brother that's just sat down, and shall not detain but a few minutes. The pious brother took a good deal of time to tell what we soon found out ourselves— that he never went to college, and don't understand logic. He boasts too of having no sheep skin to preach by; but I allow any sensible buck-sheep would have died powerful sorry, if he'd ever thought his hide would come to be handled by some preachers. The skin of the knowingest old buck couldn't do some folks any good—some things salt won't save. “I rather allow Johnny Calvin's boys and `'tother baby sprinklers,' ain't likely to have they idees physicked out of them by steam logic, and doses of No. 6. They can't be steamed up so high as to want cooling by a cold water plunge. But I want to say a word about Sprightly's preachers, because I have some slight acquaintance with that there gentleman, and don't choose to have them all run down for nothing. “The pious brother brings several grave charge s; first they ride good horses. Now don't every man, woman, and child in the Purchase know that Sprightly and his preachers have hardly any home, and that they live on horseback? The money most folks spend in land, these men spend for a good horse; and don't they need a good horse to stand mud and swim floods? And is it any sin for a horse to be kept fat that does so much work? The book says `a merciful man is merciful to his beast,' and that we mustn't `muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.' Step round that fence corner, and take a peep, dear friends, at a horse hung on the stake; what's he like? A wooden frame with a dry hide stretch'd over it. What's he live on? Ay! that's the pint? Well, what's them buzzards after?— look at them sailing up there. Now who owns that live carrion?—the pious brother that's preached to us just now. And I want to know if it wouldn't be better for him to give that dumb brute something to cover his bones, before he talks against `hunder dollur hossis' and the like? “The next charge is, wearing good clothes. Friends, don't all folks when they come to meeting put on their best clothes? and wouldn't it be wrong if preachers came in old torn coats and dirty shirts? It wouldn't do no how. Well, Sprightly and his preachers preach near about every day; and oughtn't they always to look decent! Take then a peep of the pious brother that makes this charge; his coat is out at elbow, and has only three or four buttons left, and his arm, where he wipes his nose and mouth, is shiney as a looking glass—his trousers are crawling up to show he's got no stockings on; and his face has got a crop of beard two weeks old and couldn't be cleaned by `baby sprinklin;' yes, look at them there matters, and say if Sprightly's preachers ain't more like the apostles in decency than the pious brother is. “A word now about chicken-fixins and doins. And I say it would be a charity to give the pious brother sich a feed now and then, for he looks half-starved, and savage as a meat-axe; and I advise that old hen out thare clucking up her brood not to come this way just now, if she don't want all to disappear. But I say that Sprightly's preachers are so much beliked in the Purchase, that folks are always glad to see them, and make a pint of giving them the best out of love; and that's more than can be said for some folks here. “The pious brother says, he only wants our souls—then what makes him peddle about Thomsonian physic? Why don't he and Campbell make steam and No. 6 as free as preaching? I read of a quack doctor once, who used to give his advice free gratis for nothing to any one what would buy a box of his pills—but as I see the pious brother is crawling round the fence to his anatomical horse and physical saddle bags, I have nothing more to say, and so, dear friends, I bid you all good-bye.” Such was Rev. Elder Sprightly, who preached to us on Sabbath morning at the Camp. Hence, it is not remarkable that in common with many worthy persons, he should think his talents properly employed in using up “Johnny Calvin and his boys;” especially as no subject is better for popularity at a camp-meeting. He gave us, accordingly, first, that affecting story of Calvin and Servetus, in which the latter figured to-day like a Christian Confessor and martyr, and the former as a diabolical persecuter; many moving incidents being introduced not found in history, and many ingenious inferences and suppositions tending to blacken the Reformer's character. Judging from the frequency of the deep groans, loud amens, and noisy hallelujahs of the congregation during the narrative, had Calvin suddenly thrust in among us his hatchet face and goat's beard, he would have been hissed and pelted, nay possibly, been lynched and soused in the Branch; while the excellent Servetus would have been toted on our shoulders, and feasted in the tents, on fried ham, cold chicken fixins and horse sorrel pies! Here is a specimen of Mr. S'.s mode of exciting triumphant exclamation, amens, groans, &amp;c., against Calvin and his followers:— —“Dear sisters, don't you love the tender little darling babes that hang on your parental bosoms? (amen!)—Yes! I know you do—(amen! amen!)—Yes I know, I know it—(Amen, amen! hallelujah!) Now don't it make your parental hearts throb with anguish to think those dear infantile darlings might some day be out burning brush and fall into the flames and be burned to death! (deep groans.)—Yes, it does, it does! But oh! sisters, oh! mothers! how can you think your babes mightn't get religion and die and be burned for ever and ever? (the Lord forbid—amen—groans.) But, oho! only think—only think oh! would you ever a had them darling infantile sucklings born, if you had a known they were to be burned in a brush heap! (No, no!—groans—shrieks) What! what! what! if you had foreknown they must have gone to hell!—(hoho! hoho!—amen!) And does any body think He[29] [29] We substitute words in place of the divine names—irreverently used often in sermons and prayers. is such a tyrant as to make spotless, innocent babies just to damn them? (No! in a voice of thunder.)—No! sisters! no! no! mothers! No! no! no! sinners no!!—he ain't such a tyrant! let John Calvin burn, torture and roast, but He never foreordained babies, as Calvin says, to damnation! (damnation — echoed by hundreds.)—Hallelujah! 'tis a free salvation! Glory! a free salvation!—(Here Mr S. battered the rail of the pulpit with his fists, and kicked the bottom with his feet—many screamed—some cried amen! —others groaned and hissed—and more than a dozen females of two opposite colours arose and clapped their hands as if engaged in starching, &amp;c. &amp;c.) No-h-o! 'tis a free, a free, a free salvation!—away with Calvin! 'tis for all all! ALL. Yes! shout it out! clap on! rejoice! rejoice! oho-oho! sinners, sinners, sinners, oh-ho-oho!” &amp;c. &amp;c. Here was maintained for some minutes the most edifying uproar of shouting, bellowing, crying, clapping and stamping, mingled with hysterical laughing, termed out there “holy laughing,” and even dancing! and barking! called also “holy!”—till, at the partial subsidence of the bedlam, the orator resumed his eloquence. It is singular Mr. S. overlooked an objection to the divine Providence arising from his own illustration. That children do sometimes perish by being burnt and drowned, is undeniable; yet is not their existence prevented—and that in the very case where the sisters were induced to say they would have prevented their existence! But, in justice to Mr. S., we must say that he seemed to have anticipated the objection, and to have furnished the reply; for, said he, in one part of his discourse, “God did not wish to foreknow some things!” But our friend's mode of avoiding a predestined death— if such an absurdity be supposed—deserves all praise for the facility and simplicity of the contrivance. “Let us,” said he, “for argnment's sake, grant that I, the Rev. Elder Sprightly, am foreordained to be drowned, in the River, at Smith's Ferry, next Thursday morning, at twenty-two minutes after ten o'clock; and suppose I know it; and suppose I am a free, moral, voluntary, accountable agent, as Calvinists say—do you think I'm going to be drowned? No!—I would stay at home all day; and you'll never ketch the Rev. Elder Sprightly at Smith's Ferry—nor near the river neither!” Reader, is it any wonder Calvinism is on the decline? Logic it can stand; but human nature thus excited in opposition, it cannot stand. Hence, throughout our vast assembly to-day, this unpopular ism, in spite of Calvin and the Epistle to the Romans, was put down; if not by acclamation, yet by exclamation,—by shouting,—by roaring,—by groaning and hissing,—by clapping and stamping,—by laughing, and crying, and whining; and thus the end of the sermon was gained and the preacher glorified! The introductory discourse in the afternoon was by the Rev. Remarkable Novus. This was a gentleman I had often the pleasure of entertaining at my house in Woodville; and he was a Christian in sentiment and feeling: for though properly and decidedly a warm friend to his own sect, he was charitably disposed towards myself and others that differed from him ecclesiastically. His talents were moderate; but his voice was transcendentally excellent. It was rich, deep, mellow, liquid and sonorous, and capable of any inflections. It could preserve its melody in an un-ruffled flow, at a pitch far beyond the highest point reached by the best cultivated voices. His fancy, naturally capricious, was indulged without restraint; yet not being a learned or well-read man, he mistook words for ideas, and hence employed without stint all the terms in his vocabulary for the commonest thoughts. He believed, too, like most of his brotherhood, that excitement and agitation were necessary to conversion and of the essence of religion; and this, with a proneness to delight in the music and witchery of his own wonderful voice, made Mr. Novus an eccentric preacher, and induced him often to excel at camp-meetings, the very extravagances of his clerical brethren, whom more than once he has ridiculed and condemned at my fireside. The camp-meeting was, in fact, too great a temptation for my friend's temperament, and the very theatre for the full display of his magnificent voice; and naturally, this afternoon, off he set at a tangent, interrupting the current of his sermon by extemporaneous bursts of warning, entreaty, and exhortation. Here is something like his discourse—yet done by me in a subdued tone—as, I repeat, are most extravaganzas of the ecclesiastical and spiritual sort not only here, but in all other parts of the work. “My text, dear hearers,” said he, “on this auspicious, and solemn, and heaven-ordered occasion, is that exhortation of the inspired apostle, `Walk worthy of your vocation.' “And what, my dear brethren, what do you imagine and conjecture our holy penman meant by `walking?' Think ye he meant a physical walking, and a moving, and a going backward and forward thus?—(represented by Mr. N.'s proceeding, or rather marching, a là militaire, several times from end to end of the staging.)—No! sirs!—it was not a literal walking and locomotion, a moving and agitating of the natural legs and limbs. No! sirs!—no!—but it was a moral, a spiritual, a religious, ay! yes! a philosophical and metaphorically figurative walking, our holy apostle meant! “Philosophic, did I say? Yes: philosophic did I say. For religion is the most philosophical thing in the universe —ay! throughout the whole expansive infinitude of the divine empire. Tell me, deluded infidels and mistaken unbelievers! tell me, ain't philosophy what's according to the consistency of nature's regular laws? and what's more consentaneous and homogeneous to man's sublimated moral nature than religion? Yes! tell me! Yes! yes! I am for a philosophical religion, and a philosophical religion is for me—ay! we are mutually made and formed for this beautiful reciprocality! “And yet some say we make too much noise—even some of our respected Woodville merchants—(meaning the author.)—But what's worth making a noise about in the dark mundane of our terrestrial sphere, if religion ain't? People always, and everywhere in all places, make most noise about what they opine to be most precious. See! you banner streaming with golden stars and glorious stripes over congregated troops on the fourth of July, that ever-memorable—that never-to-be-forgotten day, which celebrates the grand annual aniversary of our nation's liberty and independence! when our forefathers and ancestors burst asunder and tore forever off the iron chains of political thraldom! and arose in plenitude, ay! in the magnnificence of their grandeur, and crushed their oppressors!— yes! and hurled down dark despotism from the lofty pinnacle of its summit altitude, where she was seated on her liberty-crushing throne, and hurled her out of her iron chariot as her wheels thundered over the prostrate slaves of power! — (Amen! — hallelujah!) — Yes!—hark!—we make a noise about that! But what's civil liberty to religious liberty, and emancipated disenthraldom from the dark despotism of yonder terrific prince of darkness! whose broad, black, piniony wings spread wide o'er the aërial concave, like a dense cloud upon a murky sky?—(A-a-men!)—And ain't it, ye men of yards and measures, philosophical to make a noise about this?—(Amen!—yes!) —Yes! yes! and I ain't ashamed to rejoice and shout aloud. Ay! as long as the prophet was ordered to stamp with his foot, I will stamp with my foot;—(here he stamped till the platform trembled for its safety,)—and to smite with his hand, I will smite with my hand—(slapping alternate hands on alternate thighs.)—Yes! and I will shout too!—and cry aloud and spare not—glory! for—ever!— (and here his voice rang out like the sweet, clear tones of a bugle.) “And, therefore, my dear sisters and brethren, let us walk worthy of our vocation; not with the natural legs of the physical corporation, but in the apostolical way, with the metaphysical and figurative legs of the mind,—(here Mr. N. caught some one smiling.)—Take care, sinner, take care! curl not the scornful nose—I'm willing to be a fool for religion's sake—but turn not up the scornful nose —do its ministers no harm! Sinner! mark me!—in yon deep and tangled grove, where tall aspiring trees wave green and lofty heads in the free air of balmy skies—there, sinner, an hour ago, when the sonorous horn called on our embattled hosts to go to private prayer! an hour ago, in yonder grove I knelt and prayed for you!—(hooh!)—yes! I prayed some poor soul might be given for my hire!—and he promised me one!—(Glory! glory!—ah! give him one!)—Laughing sinner!—take care!—I'll have you!— (Grant it—amen!—ooohoo!) Look out, I'm going to fire! —(assuming the attitude of rifle-shooting)—bang!—may He send that through your heart!—may it pierce clean home through joints and marrow!—and let all the people say Amen!—(and here amen was said, and not in the tame style of the American Archbishop of Canterbury's cathedral, be assured; but whether the spiritual bullet hit the chap aimed at, I never learned; if it did, his groans were inaudible in the alarming thunder of that Amen.) “Ay! ay! that's way! that's the way! don't be ashamed of your vocation—that's the way to walk and let your light shine! Now some wise folks despise light and call for miracles: but when we can't have one kind of light, let us be philosophical and take another. For my part, when I'm bogging about these dark woods, far away in the silent sombre shadows, I rejoice in sunshine; and would prefer it of choice rather than all other celestial and translucent luminaries: but when the gentle fanning zephyrs of the shadowy night breathe soft among the trembling leaves and sprays of the darkening forests, then I rejoice in moonshine: and when the moonshine dims and pales away with the waning silvery queen of heaven in her azure zone, I look up to the blue concave of the circular vault and rejoice in star light. No! no! NO! any light!—give us any light rather than none!—(Ah, do, good Lord!) Yes! yes! we are the light of the world, and so let us let our light shine, whether sunshine, or moonshine, or star light!— (oohoo!)—and then the poor benighted sinner, bogging about this terraqueous, but dark and mundane sphere, will have a light like a pole star of the distant north, to point and guide him to the sun-lit climes of yonder world of bright and blazing bliss!”—(A-a-a-amen!) Such is part of the sermon. His concluding prayer ended thus:—(Divine names omitted.) “Oh! come down! come, come down! down! now!— to-night!—do wonders then! come down in might! come down in power! let salvation roll! Come down! come! and let the earthquaking mighty noise of thy thundering chariot wheels be heard and felt and seen and experienced in the warring elements of our spiritualized hearts!” During the prayer, many petitions and expressions were so rapturously and decidedly encored, that our friend kindly repeated them; and sometimes, like public singers, with handsome variations: and many petitions by amateur zealots were put forth, without any notice of the current prayer offered by Mr. N, yet evidently having in view some elegancy of his sermon. And not a few petitions, I regret to say, seemed to misapprehend the drift and scope of the preacher. One of this sort was the earnest ejaculations of an old and worthy brother, who in a hollow, sepulchral, and rather growly voice, bellowed out in a very beautiful part of the grand prayer—“Oohhoo! take away moonshine!” But our finest performance was to be at night: and at the first toot of the tin horn, we assembled in expectation of a “good time.” For 1. All day preparation had been making for the night; and the actors seemed evidently in restraint as in mere rehearsal: 2. the night suits better displays and scenes of any kind: but 3. the African was to preach; and rumour had said, “he was a most powerful big preacher that could stir up folks mighty quick, and use up the ole feller in less than no time.” After prefatory prayers and hymns, and pithy exhortations by several brothers of the Circassian breed, our dusky divine, the Rev. Mizraim Ham, commenced his sermon, founded on the duel between David and Goliath. This discourse we shall condense into a few pages; although the comedy or mellow-drama—(for it greatly mellowed and relaxed the muscles)—required for its entire action a full hour. There was, indeed, a prologue; but the rest was mainly dialogue, in which Mr. Ham wonderfully personated all the different speakers, varying his tone, manner, attitude, &amp;c, as varying characters and circumstances demanded. We fear much of the spirit has evaporated in this condensation; but that evil is unavoidable. REV. MIZRAIM HAM'S DISCOURSE. “Bruthurn and sisturn, tention, if you pleases, while I want you for to understand this here battul most purtiklur 'zact, or may be you moughtn't comprend 'um. Furst place, I'm gwyin to undevur to sarcumscribe fust the 'cashin of this here battul: second place, the 'comdashins of the armies: third place, the folkses as was gwyin for to fite and didn't want to, and some did: and last and fourth place, I'm gwyin for to show purtiklur 'zact them as fit juul, and git victry and git kill'd. “Tention, if you please, while I fustly sarcumscribe the 'casion of this here battul. Bruthurn and sisturn, you see them thar hethun Fillystines, what warnt circumcised, they wants to ketch King Sol and his 'ar folks for to make um slave: and so they cums down to pick a quorl, and begins a totin off all their cawn, and wouldn't 'low um to make no hoes to ho um, nor no homnee. And that 'ar, you see, stick in King Solsis gizurd; and he ups and says, says he, `I'm not gwying to be used up that 'ar away by them uncircumcis'd hethun Fillystines, and let um tote off our folkses cawn to chuck to thar hogs, and take away our hoes so we can't hoe um—and so, Jonathun, we'll drum up and list soljurs and try um a battul.' And then King Sol and his 'ar folks they goes up, and the hethun and theirn comes down and makes war. And this is the 'cashin why they fit. “Tention 'gin, if you pleases, I'm gwyin in the next place secondly, to show the 'comdashins of this here battul, which was so fashin like. The Fillystines they had thar army up thar on a mounting, and King Sol he had hissin over thar, like across a branch, amoss like that a one thar— (pointing)—and it was chuck full of sling rock all along on the bottom. And so they was both on um camp'd out; this a one on this 'ar side, and tother a one on tother, and the lilly branch tween um—and them's the comdashins. “Tention once more agin, as 'caze next place thirdly I'm a gwyin to give purtiklur 'zact 'count of sum folkses what fit and sum didn't want to. And, lubly sinnahs, maybe you minds um, as how King Sol and his soljurs was pepper hot for fite when he fust liss um; but now, lubly sinnahs, when they gits up to the Fillystines, they cool off mighty quick, I tell you! 'Caze why? I tell you; why, 'caze a grate, big, ugly ole jiunt, with grate big eyes, so fashin— (Mr. Ham made giant's eyes here)—he kums a rampin out afrunt o' them 'ar rigiments, like the ole devul a gwyin about like a half-starv'd lion a seeking to devour poor lubly sinnahs! And he cum a jumpin and a tearin out so fashin— (actions to suit)—to git sum of King Solsis soljurs to fite um juul: and King Sol, lubly bruthurn and sisturn, he gits sker'd mighty quick, and he says to Jonathun and tother big officers, says he—`I ain't a gwyin for to fite that grate big fellah.' And arter that they ups and says—`We ain't a gwyin for to fite um nuthur, 'caze he's all kiver'd with sheetirun, and his head's up so high we muss stand a hoss back to reach um!'—the jiunt he was so big!! “And then King Sol he quite down in the jaw, and he turn and ax if somebody wouldn't hunt up a soljur as would fite juul with um; and he'd give um his dawtah, the prinsuss, for wife, and make um king's son-in-law. And then one ole koretur, they call him Abnah, he comes up and say to Sol so: `Please your majuste, sir, I kin git a young fellah to fite um,' says he. And Abnah tells how Davy had jist rid up in his carruge and left um with the man what tend the hossis— and how he heern Davy a quorl'n with his bruthurs and a wantun to fite the jiunt. Then King Sol, he feel mighty glad, I tell you, sinnahs, and he make um bring um up, and King Sol he begins a talkin so, and Davy he answers so:— “`What's your name, lilly fellah?' “`I was krissen'd Davy.' “`Whose your farder?' “`They call um Jesse.' “`What you follur for livin?' “`I tend my farder's sheep.' “`What you kum arter? Ain't you affeerd of that 'ar grate ugly ole jiunt up thar, lilly Davy?' “`I kum to see arter my udder brudurs, and bring um in our carruge some cheese and muttun, and some clene shirt and trowsur, and have tother ones wash'd. And when I kum I hear ole Goliawh a hollerin out for somebody to cum and fite juul with um: and all the soljurs round thar they begins for to make traks mighty quick, I tell you, please your majuste, sir, for thar tents; but, says I, what you run for? I'm not a gwyin for to run away—if King Sol wants some body for to fite the jiunt, I'll fit um for um.' “`I mighty feerd, lilly Davy, you too leetul for um—' “`No! King Sol, I kin lick um. One day I gits asleep ahind a rock, and out kums a lion and a bawr, and begins a totin off a lilly lam; and when I heern um roarin and and pawin 'bout, I rubs my eyes and sees um gwyin to the mountings—and I arter and ketch'd up and kill um both without no gun nor sword—and I bring back poor lilly lam. I kin lick ole Goliawh, I tell you, please your majuste, sir.' “Then King Sol he wery glad, and pat um on the head, and calls um `lilly Davy,' and wants to put on um his own armur made of brass and sheetirun, and to take his sword, but Davy didn't like um, but said he'd trust to his sling. And then out he goes to fite the ole jiunt; and this 'ar brings me to the fourth and last diwishin of our surmun. “Tention once more agin' for lass time, as I'm gwyin to give most purtikurlust 'zactest 'count of the juul atween lilly Davy and ole Goliawh the jiunt, to show, lubly sinnah! how the Lord's peepul without no carnul gun nor sword, can fite ole Bellzybub and knock um over with the sling rock of prayer, as lilly Davy knock over Goliawh with hissin out of the Branch. “And to 'lusterut the juul and make um spikus, I'll show 'zactly how they talk'd, and jawd, and fit it all out: and so ole Goliawh when he see Davy a kumun, he hollurs out so, and lilly Davy he say back so:— “What you kum for, lilly Jew?—” “What I kum for! you'll find out mighty quick, I tell you—I kum for fite juul—” “Huhh! huhh! haw!—'tink I'm gwyin to fite puttee lilly baby? I want king Sol or Abnah, or a big soljur man—” “Hole your jaw—I'll make you laugh tother side, ole grizzle-gruzzle, 'rectly,—I'm man enough for biggust jiunt Fillystine.” “Go way, poor lilly boy! go home, lilly baby, to your mudder, and git sugar plum—I no want kill puttee lilly boy—” “Kum on!—dont be afeerd!—dont go for to run away! —I'll ketch you and lick you—” “You d—n leetul raskul—I'll kuss you by all our gods —I'll cut out your sassy tung[30] [30] Mr. Ham preferred Webster's Dictionary—which spells according to nature. —I'll break your blackguard jaw,—I'll rip you up and give um to the dogs and crows—” “Dont kuss so, ole Golly! I 'sposed you wanted to fite juul—so kum on with your old irun-pot hat on—you'll git belly full mighty quick—” “You nasty leetul raskul, I'll kum and kill you dead as chopped sassudge.” Here the preacher represented the advance of the parties; and gave a florid and wonderfully effective description of the closing act partly by words and partly by pantomime; exhibiting innumerable marches and counter-marches to get to windward, and all the postures, and gestures, and defiances, till at last he personated David putting his hand into a bag for a stone:—and then making his cotton handkerchief into a sling, he whirled it with fury half a dozen times around his head, and then let fly with much skill at Goliath; and at the same instant halloing with the phrenzy of a madman—“Hurraw! for lilly Davy!” At that cry he, with his left hand, struck himself a violent slap on the forehead, to represent the blow of the sling stone litting the giant; and then in person of Goliath he droped quasi dead upon the platform amid the deafening plaudits of the congregation; all of whom, some spiritually, some sympathetically, and some carnally, took up the preacher's triumph shout— “Hurraw! for lilly Davy.” How the Rev. Mizraim Ham made his exit from the boards I could not see—perhaps he rolled or crawled off. But he did not suffer decapitation, like “ole Golly:” since, in ten minutes, his woolly pate suddenly popped up among the other sacred heads that were visible over the front railing of the rostrum, as all kept moving to and fro in the wild tossings of religious phrenzy. Scarcely had Mr. Ham fallen at his post, when a venerable old warrior, with matchless intrepidity, stepped into the vacated spot; and without a sign of fear carried on the contest against the Arch Fiend, whose great ally had been so recently overthrown—i. e. Goliath, (not Mr. Ham.) Yet excited, as evidently was this veteran, he still could not forego his usual introduction stating how old he was; where he was born; where he obtained religion; how long he had been a preacher; how many miles he had travelled in a year; and when he buried his wife:—all of which edifying truths were received with the usual applauses of a devout and enlightened assembly. But this introduction over; (which did not occupy more than fifteen or twenty minutes,) he began his attack in fine style, waxing louder and louder as he proceeded, till he exceeded all the old gentlemen to “holler” I ever heard, and indeed old ladies either. EXTRACT FROM HIS DISCOURSE. “— — — Yes, sinners! you'll all have to fall and be knock'd down some time or nuther, like the great giant we've heern tell on, when the Lord's sarvints come and fight agin you! Oho! sinner! sinner—oh!—I hope you may be knock'd down to night—now!—this moment— and afore you die and go to judgment! Yes! oho! yes! oh!—I say judgment—for it's appinted once to die and then the judgment—oho! oh! And what a time ther'll be then! You'll see, all these here trees—and them 'are stars, and yonder silver moon a fire!—and all the alliments a meltin and runnin down with fervent heat-ah!”—(I have elsewhere stated that the unlearned preachers out there (?) are by the vulgar—[not the poor]— but the vulgar, supposed to be more favoured in preaching than man-made preachers; and that the sign of an unlearned preacher's inspiration being in full blast is his inhalations, which puts an ah! to the end of sentences, members, words, and even exclamations, till his breath is all gone, and no more can be sucked in)— “Oho! hoah! fervent heat-ah!—and the triumpit a soundinah!—and the dead arisin-ah!—and all on us a flyin-ah!—to be judged-ah!—Oohoah! sinner—sinner—sinner-ah! And what do I see away tharah!—down the Massissipp-ah!— thar's a man jist done a killin-ah!—another-ah!—and up he Vol. II.—8 goes with his bloody dagger-ah! And what's that I see to the East-ah! where proud folks live clothed in purple ah! and fine linen-ah!—I see 'em round a table a drinkin a decoction of Indian herb-ah!—and up they go with cups in thar hands-ah! and see—ohoah!—see! in yonder doggery some a dancin-ah! and a fiddlin-ah!—and up they go-ah! with cards ah! and fiddle-ah!” &amp;c. &amp;c. Here the tempest around drowned the voice of the old hero: although, from the frantic violence of his gestures, the frightful distortion of his features, and the Pythonic foam of his mouth, he was plainly blazing away at the enemy. The uproar, however, so far subsided as to allow my hearing his closing exhortation, which was this: “—Yes I say—fall down—fall down all of you, on your knees!—shout!—cry aloud!—spare not!—stamp with the fool!—smite with the hand!—down! down!— that's it!—down brethren!—down preachers!—down sisters!—pray away!—take it by storm!—fire away! fire away! not one at a time! not two together-ah!—a single shot the devil will dodge-ah!—give it to him all at once— fire a whole pla'oon!—at him!!” And then such platoon firing as followed! If Satan stood that, he can stand much more than the worthy folks thought he could. And, indeed, the effect was wonderful! —more than forty thoughtless sinners that came for fun, and twice as many backsliders were instantly knocked over!—and there all lay, some with violent jerkings and writhings of body, and some uttering the most piercing and dismaying shrieks and groans! The fact is, I was nearly knocked down myself— “You?—Mr. Carlton!!” Yes,—indeed—but not by the hail of spiritual shot falling so thick around me: it was by a sudden rush towards my station, where I stood mounted on a stump. And this rush was occasioned by a wish to see a stout fellow lying on the straw in the pen, a little to my left, groaning and praying, and yet kicking and pummelling away as if scuffling with a sturdy antagonist. Near him were several men and women at prayer, and one or more whispering into his ear; while on a small stump above, stood a person superintending the contest, and so as to ensure victory to the right party. Now the prostrate man, who like a spirited tom-cat seemed to fight best on his back, was no other than our celebrated New Purchase bully—Rowdy Bill! And this being reported through the congregation, the rush had taken place by which I was so nearly overturned. I contrived, however, to regain my stand shared indeed, now, with several others, we hugging one another and standing on tip-toes and our necks elongated as possible; and thus we managed to have a pretty fair view of matters. About this time the Superintendent in a very loud voice cried out,—“Let him alone, brothers! let him alone sisters! —keep on praying!—its a hard fight—the devil's got a tight grip yet! He don't want to lose poor Bill—but he'll let go soon—Bill's gittin the better on him fast!—Pray away!” Rowdy Bill, be it known, was famous as a gouger, and so expert was he in his antioptical vocation, that in a few moments he usually bored out an antagonist's eyes, or made him cry peccavi. Indeed, could he, on the present occasion, have laid hold of his unseen foe's head, (spiritually we mean,) he would (figuratively of course) soon have caused him to ease off or let go entirely his metaphorical grip. So, however, thought one friend in the assembly— Bill's wife. For Bill was a man after her own heart; and she often said that “with fair play she sentimentally allowed her Bill could lick are a man in the 'varsal world, and his weight in wild cats to boot.” Hence, the kind hearted creature, hearing that Bill was actually fighting with the devil, had pressed in from the outskirts to see fair play; but now hearing Bill was in reality down, and apparently undermost, and above all, the words of the superintendent, declaring that the fiend had a tight grip of the poor fellow, her excitement would no longer be controlled; and, collecting her vocal energies, she screamed out her common exhortation to Bill, and which, when heeded, had heretofore secured him immediate victories—“Gouge him, Billy!—gouge him, Billy!—gouge him!” This spirited exclamation was instantly shouted by Bill's cronies and partisans—mischievously, maybe, for we have no right to judge of men's motives, in meetings:—but a few, (friends doubtless of the old fellow,) cried out in a very irreverent tone—“Bite him! devil—bite him! Upon which, the faithful wife, in a tone of voice that beggars description, reiterated her—“Gouge him,” &amp;c.—in which she was again joined by her husband's allies, and that to the alarm of his invisible foe; for Bill now rose to his knees, and on uttering some mystic jargon symptomatic of conversation, he was said to have “got religion;”—and then all his new friends and spiritual guides united in fresh prayers and shouts of thanksgiving. It was now very late at night; and joining a few other citizens of Woodville, we were soon in our saddles and buried in the darkness of the forest. For a long time, however, the uproar of the spiritual elements at the camp continued at intervals to swell and diminish on the hearing; and, often came a yell that rose far above the united din of other screams and outcries. Nay, at the distance of nearly two miles, could be distinguished a remarkable and sonorous oh!—like the faintly heard explosion of a mighty elocutional class practising under a master. And yet my comrades, who had heard this peculiar cry more than once, all declared that this wonderful oh-ing was performed by the separate voice of our townsman, Eolus Letherlung, Esq.! At length the din died sullenly away, like the indistinct mutter of a retiring hurricane! But for that night and the next day, the scenes and cries of the camp were vivid before my eyes and ringing in my ears; and more than once, in night dreams, appeared Rowdy Bill dressed in his wife's cap and short-gown, and standing on the breast of Goliath; while near stood a dwarf negro with two heads, flourishing in his hand a corn-hoe, and crying from both his mouths— “Gouge him! Billy, gouge him!” Next day, (as I was told by an eye-witness and in triumph.) the new converts, amounting to more than two hundred!! were all paraded and marched around the campgrounds, under the appellation of “virgins following the Lamb!”—after which, they were enrolled and acknowledged as “trophies snatched from Satan!” It being impossible, therefore, to gainsay facis, I was constrained, spite of my latent hostility to certain Big Meetings, to acknowledge to my friend, who insisted on my immediate and honest answer, to acknowledge that:— A camp-meeting was, all things considered, the very best contrivance and means for making the largest number of converts in the shortest possible time; and also for enlarging most speedily the bounds of a Church Visible and Militant. CHAPTER XLIX. “Amor vincit omnia” “Love laughs at locksmiths!” Our present chapter treats of love and matrimony. Doubtless it has occurred to the reader, that John Glenville is yet a bachelor and ought to be looking out for a wife. Now, although John was never overhead and ears in love, he yet was always falling into it—knee deep at least; but as yet, he had never found anybody for help-meet, though several were disposed to be help-mates. My friend had, indeed, often gone “a gallin” among our log-cabin beauties; and sometimes received answers so serious to his sportive questions as to make his backing out very difficult and ungraceful. For instance, he once accompanied Peggy home from a night meeting; and on reaching the cabin she paused a moment by the wood pile, when John playfully said: “Well, Peggy, I've a notion to go in and court awhile, what do you say to it?” “Well—maybe you mought and maybe you moughtn't—” “Why? has anybody cut me out?” “Hey?!” “Perhaps somebody else is gallin down here?” “Prehaps thar is, and prehaps thar isn't.” “Awh! come Peggy do tell me.” Here Peggy looked down in some perplexity, as balancing uncertainties, and after kicking up a large heap of chips with the toe of her shoe, she seemed to have arrived at the conclusion—“a bird in the hand,” &amp;c.—and, therefore modestly answered:— “Well! John—I'm a kinder sorter courted like, and a kinder sorter not like,—but I'm more a kinder sorter not, nor a kinder sorter—and I allow you'd better step in and see daddy; tain't late—although mammy's in bed.” Of course, John got out as awkwardly as we end his adventure. But once Glenville was caught more effectually and much more to his surprise; and yet, he backed out with some ingenuity. The lady, however, had ultimately her revenge. He was on a visit of business in an adjoining state, when he was invited by the celebrated Mr. Brown to spend a few days at his house. Here he became naturally interested in Miss Brown, the daughter—a young lady of some beauty, of much good nature, of good talents, and mistress of many useful acquirements beside several ornamental branches. In an unguarded moment, John sportively popped the question, or rather popped at the question, by wondering how Miss B. would like to live in a cabin with such a Hoosier as himself; to which Paddy's hint, Miss B. too seriously intimated that Mr. G. had better consult her father on such points. Now, generous reader, Glenville was by no means ready to forsake father and mother at that time; and the cabin alluded to, was so open and unchincked, that poverty could easily enough have crept in all around, and love gone flying out through an hundred crevices in addition to the doors and window. In plain English, the fellow was too poor to ask any woman to share his poverty; unless she belonged to the Range, was used “to chinkin and daubin, and to makin huntin shirts and lether brichis:” hence after musing on the affair the whole night, he seized an opportunity the next morning of renewing with Miss B. the colloquy of the previous afternoon. In this he painted in true colours, the cheerlessness of his rude cabin and his half hunter's life, and the privations and sufferings to which such a man's wife would necessarily be subjected; and then, with some ingenuity, (certainly with some boldness,) he wished to know if such a man ought to ask any kind parent, in affluent circumstances, to send away an amiable and beloved daughter. To his relief, Miss B., with a slight betrayal of surprise, —(John said “mortification,”)—agreed with him; but after this his situation was so awkward, that he left Mr. Brown's mansion that very day. Here, therefore, is another proof that some things can be done as well as others; and while this affair is not quite so odd as that of Deerslayer and Judith, yet it shows the difference between truth and fiction. Well, the present winter, Glenville being often on visits to Woodville, and circumstances existing to alter cases, we frequently rallied the bachelor on his courtships; and more than once, in full assembly, voted that he must and should forthwith go and find a wife. To all this, he opposed the stale replies, that he was too old now—could find nobody to suit him—and that such as would suit would not have him,—till at last he consented, if I could find the proper person, and persuade her to have him, he would marry. Accordingly, one night after such a discussion, Glenville and myself sat alone by the fire, when the following talk went on in continuation of the subject:— “But, Glenville, are you really serious?” “Yes, Carlton, I am really serious.” “Still, you would not marry if you did not love?” “Well—I'm not quite so sure there. At all events, I shall easily love any girl you will choose—especially if you choose Miss Brown.” “Come, John, be candid—did you ever truly love her?” “More, perhaps, than I ever loved any one before, or ever shall again.” “And why did you back out so foolishly?” “For the very reasons I have a thousand times told you. I was too poor—my home too utterly dreary to take such a girl to—and if I had ever dreamed my jesting manner would have been mistaken, I should have been far enough from trifling with her —” “Suppose she had seemed willing next morning?” “I would have consulted her father, unquestionably— but for the daughter's sake, I should have regretted his consent.” “Well, Glenville, what do you say to Miss Smythe?— I think she feels tender towards you.” “She would do:—and with a little practice I should love her as well as most men love their wives. But Carlton, the Squire has been cutting round there the last six months, and —” “No odds—suppose you try?” “Willingly, if I thought there was any chance; but, in the first place, maybe she's engaged—next, maybe she might not want me—and so I do not like to lose my time and run risk, and —” “Tut! tut!—you need not waste any time; for I'll write a love-letter for you; and as to the other objection, I'll bet a coon skin you're too modest, and the girl, if disengaged, will have you.” “Carlton!—will you write such a letter? If you will, I'll deliver it.” “Done!—and I'll write you as many more as you like.” “Suppose, then, you do another for Miss Brown? and so I shall have two snaps.” “Agreed—when shall I do them?” “Any time between this and next Saturday. I shall be 8* in Woodville then, you know—so 'tis settled,—come, I'm tired, let's go to bed.” The two letters were duly concocted, the first one to be delivered to Miss Smythe,[31] [31] We do not expect the reader to laugh here, unless he is so disposed —I only laughed at the time because I could not help it. the other, in case of the first failing, was to be sent to Miss Brown; but if Miss S. was disengaged and smiled propitious, John was, to all intents and purposes, a married man; and Miss Brown was to have no opportunity of revenge. The letter for Miss Smythe was as follows:— “Miss E. A. Smythe, “A knowledge of your character, derived from mutual friends, from the opinion of all your acquaintances, and also from a somewhat intimate personal acquaintance, induces me to believe that such a lady would fill the vacancy in my domestic establishment most perfectly and delightfully:— although I am not vain enough to suppose Miss Smythe will necessarily feel herself flattered by such a preference on the part of the writer. As, however, Miss S. on better acquaintance, might become interested in him—more so at least than he fears she is at present—he very respectfully, yet most carnestly, craves permission to pay his addresses in person. “Very truly, your humble servant, “But great admirer, “John Glenville.” The letter to Miss Brown, or rather for her, as it was addressed to the father, was this:— “My dear sir, “In a playful conversation on a subject so common when unmarried persons meet, your daughter, Miss Brown, in a jesting manner, remarked, that she always referred gentlemen to her father—as his choice would always be hers. What was jest with her, with me would have become very solemn earnest, had I had then to offer any thing beyond my hand and my heart, to induce such a girl to leave such a home. Happily, circumstances are now favourably altered; and willingly now would I ask that father for his daughter could I flatter myself the daughter could be induced to gladden and adorn a hearth, which, however warm in one sense, must be yet cold and cheerless without the love of a bosom friend. And such a friend would Miss Brown prove:—and, dear sir, if you think such a match suitable for your lovely daughter, I sincerely entreat the communication of your favourable opinion to her in my behalf—hoping that the daughter's choice then may be as the father's. “I have, sir, the honour to be “Your obedient servant, “J. Glenville.” On Saturday Glenville came; when after reading, criticising, correcting, and laughing, he took copies of the letters; it being arranged, that he put one in each coat pocket, and on waiting next day on Miss Smythe from church, he should, at a proper time, hand her the proper letter. And all this he accordingly did, and with no greater blunder than putting his hand into the Brown pocket, and pulling out the wrong letter—which, if he had also delivered it to Miss Smythe, would have made our book still more interesting —but he fortunately corrected his error in time, and prevented a very handsome laugh at our expense. To save Miss S. the awkwardness of a special messenger, and to avoid prying eyes at the post-office, Glenville, on bowing adieu at the lady's door, stated that he would call in person next morning for an answer. At that time, therefore, after lots of speculating as to the style and manner of the answer, Glenville, with Miss Brown's letter in his pocket, and anxious not to be too early for the lady's convenience, nor too late for the ardent affection he intended to have, marched off very bravely, looking back once or twice and shaking his fist as he caught sight of our cachinating faces. Well, in due season he returned—but what pen or pencil can give the odd expression of that face! “Well, Glenville, what luck?”—(Can I ever forget the peculiar intonation, emphasis, inflection of that answer?) “Engaged!” “Is it possible!—but if she had not been, what then?” “Bah!—do you think I asked her?” “Why not?—I should like to know what she thinks of you.” “Why not!!—in case she did not fancy me, was I going to suffer a double refusal, when one is decisive?” “Haw! ha! he![32] [32] She was distantly related to the Smiths in the city, and the r kins-folks the Smythes. but what have you done with Miss Brown's letter?” “Dropp'd it in the office as I came along; and there's a chance for Miss Brown to have her revenge. Bet a dollar she says no!” The case of my friend was like that of the school boy, who described his disappointment in a composition, which we shall here introduce to fill up the time till the return mail. “COMPOSITION ON HUNTING.” “The other morning I went out a hunting with father's duck-gun what he brung out from Kentucky; but as I had no luck, I allowed I might as well put off for home; and so I turn about and goes towards home. As I come to the edge of our clearin, what should I see away off on the top of a dead walnut, but a black crow! And so I makes up my mind to try and hit him. The critter was more nor three hundred yards from me; but I insinuates myself along as near as two hundred yards to the feller; when he begins a showing signs of flittin: and so I trees where I was in a minute. Well, I determines to try him there, although 'twas near as good as desperut to try a black crow that distance with a shot-gun; although father's duck-gun's the most powerful shot-gun in the Purchis. Howsomdever, I wanted the load out; and I thought I might as well fire that a way as any other—and so up I draws the piece very careful, and begins a takin aim, thinking all the while I shouldn't hit him: still I tuk the most exactest aim, as if I should; when just then he hops about two foot nearer my way, as if to get a look round my tree, where he smelt powder—and then, thinking all the time, as I said, I shouldn't hit him, as the distance was so most powerful fur, I blazed away!—and sure enough, as I'm alive—I didn't hit him!” Now Glenville, from the distance of his second shot, insisted he should never hit: yet how near he came may be conjectured from the following replies to his epistle:— “John Glenville, Esq,— “Dear Sir— * * * * * * and the inclosed from my daughter, to whom was handed your late communication, contains, I presume, the most satisfactory answer, * * * * and * * * “Yours, very respectfully, &amp;c. “Redman Green Brown.” Now, this sentence in the envelope containing a sealed letter from Miss Brown, brought “the crow about two feet nearer;” and John's eyes began to sparkle, although he continued humbly affirming that the sealed epistle contained —“No!” “Sir:— “I honour you for honesty, as I am satisfied you assign true reasons for not taking one to share your home; although the reasons themselves can never seem satisfactory where one was willing to share another's heart. For, like most girls in their days of romance, that one cared to find only a heart when she married. As my own home is sufficiently comfortable, there can be no inducement to wish another, however comfortable, in the New Purchase; and where its owner seems to think `altered circumstances' are important in winning a woman's love. But to show that kindness is estimated that would spare my delicacy, by leading my dear father to think all our conversation had been sportive, I do hereby most cordially—(here John looked! oh! I tell you what!)—invite you to our Christmas festivities, when the writer changes her name from Mary Brown to Mary Burleigh.” “There, Carlton! I told you so—I said it would be— no! And yet secretly did I wish,—ay! I do wish it now —that the answer could be—yes! I am glad the girl has her revenge; but still I have known too many hard-ships not to feel happy in the reflection, that one I did love a little, and could now love a great deal, has never been called to share them.” And so after all, reader, our chapter ends without a wedding! proving how hard it is to get an old bachelor married. Another year we may, perhaps, be more successful.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">FIFTH YEAR. CHAPTER L. “The three R's—Readin, Ritin, Rithmetic.” London Alderman's Toast. “I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus— The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool, With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news.” A GREAT quarrel between the Rev. C. Clarence and the Commonwealth of Woodville, was in reference to the kind of education fit for Hoosiers, Woolverines, and other true democrats. Our man of learning contended for a liberal and thorough discipline of the mind; while we insisted on a practical education. He argued that no course of education paid for by the government, ought to have exclusive regard to any class, or to any one art, trade, or profession: but that where the State furnished the means, the best intellectual education should be given both to the poor and the rich. Nay, he even affirmed that men ought not to be trained as mere Americans, and much less as mere western or eastern citizens; but as men of the world, as gentlemen, as Christians. About this time Mind, having been accommodated with a pair of legs, and the said legs being fitted with seven league boots, had marched our way, and was now marking time very furiously in the Purchase. Indeed, we began to be born in circumstances favourable to sucking in thought, or something else, from maternal breasts: and by aid of patent books and machinery, we now obtained as much knowledge by the time we could carry a rifle, or tree a raccoon, as our grandmothers had acquired in a long life! And all this was real American, United States' learning!— useful, practical stuff!—such as would enable a fellow to get his own bread and butter; or in New Purchase terms, his hog and hominy! In the far east, it is true, circumstances demanded many knowledges — chemistry, botany, anatomy, conchology, bugology, insectology, phrenology, animal magnetism,— any one of which science, or no science, could, in the improved era, be mastered by hearing three lectures and reading one pamphlet, and all of them in a few weeks; at least, all that was practical and useful to gain money with: for so nut-shelly had all books and subjects become, that all could be even cracked and devoured in infant schools! Yea! and any teacher could administer a rich and nutricious literary pap, that made children bloat right up—and till they perspired knowledges through their very pores! And yea! again, till every body has been taught every thing—and curiosity itself is satiated!—and the Mind having had a long and wearisome march, and a toilsome beating of time, has drawn off its boots and is laid down in a deep and death-like repose! But in the Purchase, utility required little beyond the learned alderman's R. R R.; except a little “Jografree,” and “Surveyin” enough to run lines around a quarter section: which were “naterally allowed to be a sorter useful like.” Nor was our inference to be blamed, if education be, as it has been made for the last twenty-five years, and is to be made for the next fifty, a thing of utility, latitudes and meridians; for we New Purchase folks lived, not as folks at Boston, or New-York; and did not, hence, need the same kind of education. Nor cared we for other people's notions, being content with our own. If the Great-North-American United-States Theories and Systems are founded in true philosophy, then the Rev. Charles Clarence, A.M. should have come down from his stilts, and become popular and useful, and have educated us as we wished, and not as we ought to be. And many were the friends he would have bought; ay, and he could have made some money too, had he spoken in favour of Patent Picture Books that represented truth and falsehood too, enigmatically; and had he abused classical learning! Had he delivered Taylorian twattle! or sent two boxes of dried bugs! or a chest of flints! with a pair of globes, a double wooden cone, and other toys to common schools! And had he not advocated heathen establishments, where poor darling children read about Jupiter, and Venus, and other he and she divinities, instead of those noble, man-confiding, common schools, which in some places so abhor all gods, as to acknowledge none either by public prayer, or the reading of a Divine Revelation! Fortunate times! when a politician may acquire reputation for all learning, and patriotism, and wisdom, and philanthropy, by making a fourth-rate plagiarized speech before some third-rate Lyceum in favour of Practical American Education! Or by sending five and a half dollars worth of pebbles and toy-machinery to the People's School to impart the knowledges! Alas! Clarence, little believed I once in your predictions! We thought you an ill-boding crow! And yet Classical Learning with all its generous, manly, and intellectual cognates is in most places dead—in all dying! In his last letter Clarence himself thus writes:— — “I am now in an incorporated classical and mathematical academy at the capital of a boastful little State—a school where once numerous pupils were disciplined in my favourite system, and in due time became men. But “Othello's occupation's gone!” I have only three pupils professedly studying even Latin! and that only to understand law-terms! The rest are literally in the R. R. R. and Jogerfree! Indeed, in a population of some twelve thousand bodies, we can count but twelve souls as classical scholars in any of the schools, public or private! So much for utilitarianism. It pulls down; it never has, it never can build up! It will hardly go to heaven if not paid for it! Carlton! are we out of the woods? Has that impudent far-famed Theory of Practical Education, made us, as was promised, richer and happier and better? Does it not seem, that Providence has permitted our losses and distresses to show, among other matters, that where education is debased into a system to sharpen men's wits and appetites, and furnish instruments merely with which to make money and spend it, that education is a curse? After all, are there not very many illiterate fellows worth immense estates, who can barely “read, rite, and sifer?” and who are vastly richer than the best utilitarian school system ever made any body? And as to mere knowledge and knowledges, separate from mental discipline, are they not productive of more evil than good, more sorrow than pleasure? To educate men for making most money in the shortest time, tends directly to content them with the shortest, the cheapest, the most paltry education; and it is natural all mere utilitarian schemes should degenerate into the most pitiful and meagre systems. After all, an education in mental discipline, in the good old way, is the best for practical uses; and if a disciplined man fail in making money or gaining worldly honours, he never can fail, if virtuous, in possessing his intellectual superiority and its concomitant joys; but my paper is out. Farewell.”[33] [33] Since writing the above Clarence informs me the trustees have dismissed him and shut the academy, as the people do not wish a classical school at all! Yes, Clarence, you were right and we wrong. Well do I remember your lectures and conversations, in which you insisted it was wrong to appeal so exclusively to the selfish and political feelings and views, and thus coax men to have schools. How you argued that whole communities, if disappointed in immediate and profitable results, came soon to ask “cuibono?” not only as to the classics, but even as to the sacred R. R. R. themselves. For what was else to be expected, when virtue itself was valued as it was found useful; and honesty practiced and tolerated, because the best policy? Yes! yes! thy mantle is fallen upon me! the puerile picture-book, the question and answer, the no-studying, the cheap as dirt, and nearly as worthless systems, shall all themselves come in due time to be neglected! Ay! for a while, a time and a half a time, in some degrees and minutes and seconds shall rage utility and selfishness; and this lower world's honours and glories shall be sought and not found for everybody and everybody's son in the lecture system, and the common school system, and the lyceum system; and then before the reformation shall the friend-to-man and humbug-system, as well as the nobility-making and the aristocratical teaching first receive nothing from pupils, and then pay a premium for scholars! Amen. Our prefessor, however, did persuade a few to lay the proper foundation of mental discipline in the proper union of classical and abstract mathematical studies. And so well did he cause to appear the few thus persuaded, in contrast to equals restricted elsewhere to the beggarly elements of a good(?) English education; and so manifest had it become, that the R. R. R. and other common and even uncommon English branches could all be acquired, while pupils were laying the proper foundation, that not only were some of the Woodville common wealth induced to try “the high and big-bug larnin,” but pupils for the same purpose began to come from abroad. And these were styled Foreign and Strange Students. And then, dear reader, as moneys came in, you have no idea how converts increased to the doctrine of College-utility! for none could deny the utility! It was tangible, visible, audible! With our own eyes we saw Cash! handled it with our fingers! heard it jingle with our ears! And all at once “high larning” became as popular as common schools. It was equal to a productive system, or grammar! It raised the wind! It brought the rhino! Only show that a school, an academy, a college, or, a church, will advance the value of town lots—bring in more consumers—create a demand for beef, cloth, pepper and salt, powder and shot; then, from the vulgar plebeian dealing in shoe leather, up to the American nobleman dealing in shops, and who retails butter and eggs, we shall hear one spontaneous voice in favour! But wo, Pedagogue, if all are not speedily benefited by your school! Wo! if town lots rise not! if boots are not worn with dandy heels! if every body that has one spare room and two garrets, obtain not boarders! if cloth sells not ever so many hundred per cent, above cost! if, in short, you enrich not all your dear fellow-townsmen!—then shall you hear the growlings of swine-like selfishness, and be asked “what's the use of learning?” Then shall you be complimented with many honorary titles, as “pitiful schemer!”—“book worm!”—“idle rascal!” Or, all will be summed in “darn'd Yankee!”—the most comprehensive A.M. that can be bestowed in the Purchase, saving two lower case “d. d.” a few years after this innocently given, because he was “out of sorts,” by our college printer to the worthy and reverend Constant Bloduplex, d. d. The star of Clarence was, however, on the ascendant; and he that had introduced “the d—n Yankee trick” of exacting written excuses, was suddenly discovered to be “a powerful and mighty clever feller!” And his “high larn'd idees” had more good in them than one could have conjectured! But when two gentlemen from a slave State appeared in Woodville, at the opening of this summer's session, and not merely with three boys as new scholars, but with the avowed intentions of buying town lots and living with us till the education of their sons should be completed; and when these gentlemen were seen in broadcloth coats with yellow buttons, and canton crape pantaloons, walking round and examining sites for dwellings— then was the college extolled to the very heavens! And Clarence! what did he not become? If not a demi-god, at least within a fourth of it—a veritable semi-demi-one, a genuine terrestrial quarter-deus! Poor fellow! he was a little inflated by the popular breath; and mistaking the vox populi for the vox dei, he said the college was safe! and that Providence had some remarkably excellent things in view for the great valley of the Mississippi in general, and for our portion of it in particular! Ah! enthusiast! how you made us thrill with your paintings of our future! How you thanked Heaven for casting your lot among us! and dreamed of sumptuous edifices for colleges! and libraries! and apparatus! and crowded recitation rooms! You lost sight of your own principles, and thought pyramids could be built on air! Happily, my friend's day-dreaming was soon dispelled, or he would have been ruined. As it was, he increased his own library many fold. He bought Minoras, and Majoras, and Homers, and Ciceros, and lexicons, and concordances, and antiquities, and anthologies, and architectures—and would have ordered the whole stock of the Carvils—as if beastly selfishness in a community was the basis for a large library, more than for a liberal, manly, gentlemanly, and Christian education! In these pleasing circumstances, our Principal relaxed not the reins of wholesome discipline. And at this very juncture, our Faculty had promulged a decree against something; but on finding both public and private admonition unavailing, they advertised that the next transgression would be visited by a brief suspension. On the very next day two pupils were seen by both masters, and in the very act of disobedience; and of course Crabstick and Thorntree were suspended for—twenty-four hours! Many things create surprise in our mysterious world, which are followed, some by contempt, others by indignation and rage. A tom-cat exquisite leaps lightly on a toilette before a glass, and for the first sees a rival waving a taper tail, arching a velvet back, and purring with the most provoking complacency—all where he had reigned alone! His eye dilates with amazement! yet in a moment he intrudes his nose behind the mirror and the antagonist cat is vanished! And Tom ever after treats such semblances with the coolest indifference. Not so Haw-Buck, who came into town to see the battle of Bunker Hill. His surprise was followed with indignation at the reckless chaps that handled fire-arms so carelessly. “Why darn 'em,” as he took off his ram-beaver and saw a hole in its cylinder, “why darn 'em! if they hain't a firin bullits!” The surprise of Woodville, in its consequences, was analogous, not to that of pussy, but of Haw-Buck. The pupils generally heard the sentence with a look that said— “we allow the masters don't know what they are doing!” —while Crabstick and Thorntree left the room in manifest indignation! And then, in a few hours, the fama clamosa was conveyed to every man, woman and child in all Woodville; and in a few more, to every one in our whole settlement! At first, our community was dumb! Yard-sticks were arrested in admeasurements! Needles stood with thread in the eye! Wax-ends stuck in awl-holes! Planes, hammers, axes, saws, and other industrious implements ceased operating! And our folks hurried forth to unite wonders! Every store became crowded; and every bar-room and doggery! Knots of wise persons gathered at every corner; and all places were full of winks, shrugs, elevated eyebrows, puckered mouths, and quivering noses! It was soon rumoured that Thorntree, a foreign student, had hired a horse from Liebug, and in an uncontrollable fit of dudgeons gone home to his father, Major Thorntree. And then, if our regulators had, like the ass in one of his phases, been dumb, they now imitated him in another; for no unanimous braying of a herd of donkeys could equal the hideous outcries of my townsmen! My store was always a head quarters, for I was a leading trustee; beside we were liberal in the nut and apple line; and also gave, often, third-rate raisins to women and children, and fragments of lead, or a second rate flint to a chap. But above all “Carltin was the feller to play the flute and the fiddle, and his ole woman, the body what could rattle the pianny!” For some days, our store was now jammed with representatives extra from all the arts, trades and professions; yes, and ages and sexes; and I was worn down with talking and hearing, but without selling a dollar's worth. I took some revenge, indeed, by giving away no goodies, and hinting to some of the most violent and abusive a settlement of accounts. SPECIMENS OF TALK. “I say, Mr. Carltin, ain't you goin to put the fellers out?” “Put out! why?” “Why!—why it's plain enuf they've gone on like 'ristecrats—and won't it take away a poor man's livin?” “Just the other way, if all was understood —” “Didn't Thorntree get boots of me?” “Yes—and cakes and candy at our shop?” “And what's more to the pint, Carltin, won't the Major go agin us next legislatur?” “Well—arter all, what did the studints do? only break a d—d Yankee reg'lashin for five minits or so?” “Yes—and the master down our settlemint says he never heern tell of sich a rule; and he's sentimentally of opinion it's a robbin a boy of his money by keepin him out a school for nothun no how —” “I tell you what, I heern Bob say he expects Squire Brompton is goin agin 'em—Clarinse and all —” “That's my sentiments, 'cos Major Thorntree —” “No—that's not the why; but Bob thinks the Squire won't sell his lots to them what's to be new comers —” “Have the gentlemen given up the bargain?” “Well, I don't know as they has; but Bob says he expects the Squire will think so —” “What's Sylvan say, Carltin?” “I have not heard him say any thing.” “You ain't! well, Jake says ole man Hazel told his son's wife, that the doctor tell him the Fakilty had been too quick —” “I do not believe it; for the Faculty acted with the utmost deliberation, and —” “Yes—you always stick to thar side; but darn my leggins, if I ain't powerful glad they did something to turn them out.” “Why?” “Bekase they're sectarians and rats; and its high time the rest on us had a chance. `Rotashin in offus,' as old Hickery Face says—`rotashin for ever!”' “Pick my flint! if I didn't always say they'd do some high-hand something some day, as soon as Clarinse made Polly's step-son bring excusis on paper in hand-rite!” “Joe Patchin, is Crabstick and Thorntree goin to come back—did you a sort a hear?” “Crabstick is, maybe—but not tother.” “Why?” “'Cos he said to Liebug when he hired his hoss, says he, `I hope I may be rowed up Salt River if ever I cum back agin to school any more, if the trustees don't turn out Clarinse and Harwood!”' “And so, Mr. Carltin your Board's a goin to meet!” “Yes, the Major is here with his son, and they insist on a meeting to see who is to blame —” “Bust my rifle! we'll dog out the rats now!” “Yes, Ned, but if the Faculty have done right —” “Carltin!—you're a honest sort a feller—but bust my rifle! if I ever run up a 'count agin in your 'are store, if you vote for the fakilty-fellers.” “Ned!—I'm sorry you would bribe me to do wrong; but, Ned, a man's bribe is not very powerful, as long as his old account is not paid —” “You needn't a be a hintin round that a way, Carltin.— I'll pay you now, if you'll take all trade—and bust my rifle! if I'll ever buy a pound a lead in this 'ere store agin, no how!” Such are selections from our many long, boisterous, and angry dialogues. But pass we to the next chapter, which narrates the meeting of our Board. Vol. II.—9. CHAPTER LI. Vox Populi! “Look, as I blow this feather from my face, And, as the air blows it to me again, Obeying with my wind when I do blow, And yielding to another when it blows, Commanded always by the greater gust; Such is the likeness of your common men!” Major Thorntree having come a wearisome journey, from a love of justice and to promote the welfare of Woodville,—(and so he always insisted)—our Board could but consent to a meeting; especially when the Major expressed his fears that certain statesmen[34] [34] The Major was himself a member of the Legislature; and hence had fair opportunites of knowing. might unhappily influence the next Legislature to remove the College, unless the Faculty were better watched and governed. Beside, from the report of his son, who was a very honest boy and never said anything to a person's prejudice, and from what had been stated to himself since his arrival, by some worthy citizens of Woodville, the Major really believed,—(so he said)—that there had been gross mismanagement in general by the Faculty, and much shameless partiality, and at the expense of his son particularly. He thought, too, his son's punishment was for a very trivial offence, and had been rash, and perhaps, malicious; at all events, it was excesive and arbitrary, aristocratic and unconstitutional; hence, such things must be crushed and resisted now, or there would be a speedy union of church and state. We, therefore, met. And, first, were canvassed and rejected many propositions suggested to us by different ones of our numerous lobby-members. Among these proposals were some remarkable for boldness, simplicity and ingenuity; such as “turn 'em rite out!”—“send 'em packin!” —“pay 'em and have done with 'em!—“don't pay 'em no how!”—“sue for damejis!” But it was finally determined by our honourable visitor, the Major, that we should summon the Faculty and hear their defence! Nay—he was even willing to have a trial; as he said witnesses were in attendance from the citizens, and he thought it proper also to call on all the students for their opinion and testimony! This was adopted, Mr. Carlton crying out in the negative; and so, likewise, would have done Dr. Sylvan; but unfortunately just at the time of our meeting, the Doctor was forced to go and mix medicines and then to visit a patient in a remote part of the county! About the same time, Charles Clarence was employed in castle building; or what was the same sort of architecture in the Purchase—in College building; being seated on “a cloud capt tower” of sublime and solemn view! But awaked by the braying discord of Woodville, he started from his dream! and spite of all past experience he was momentarily amazed! He had caught a new glimpse of a many headed-monster! and its enormous tail! He became sick at heart; and the warm blood of generous self-devotion in his heart congealed! He seemed in a vacuum— as if all the air was blowing from around him! Yet, soon he recalled important truths, such as—“cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils!”—“put not your trust in princes!” And when the first bitterness of the soul was past, he remembered his Divine Master; who did good to the wicked and thankless! yea, to enemies! And he thought the very folly and ignorance and malice and idleness of a community, were the very things Christ's servants must strive to enlighten, remove, correct, instruct! Ashamed then of his momentary alarm, he recalled the noble saying of an ancient statesman and warrior, who builded a wall in troublesome times; and he resolved to imitate, and like him said,—“What! shall such a man as I flee!” Meanwhile, rumour had been tramping about with her crescit eundô; and, long before the Faculty received our Scytala, they had heard her cry—“The Board has told Major Thorntree, the Faculty shall be tried and turned right out, and shall be sued for damages done the school and the State, and—Woodville, by their unconstitutional, high-hand, big-buggish, aristocratic yankee notions!!” The accused had nearly a mile to walk to the place of execution; and along the path were strewed the sovereign people to see “the fellers go along to git it!” Yet instead of beholding “two fellers” sneaking along, like office-holders trembling about their bread and butter, they saw two gentlemen proceeding with a slow and somewhat studied gait, with heads erect, countenances serene, and not rarely illuminated with smiles of mingled pity and contempt, benevolence and indignation! Sneers, therefore, ready to curl on noses, and looks of vulgar triumph, with which ?? ?????? intended to greet their victims, were changed into remarks and looks of vexed admiration; for barbarians of all kinds pay involuntary honour to calm and fearless conduct in those destined to the torture. Indeed, the crowd to-day, was at a loss to say, whether the Faculty were going up town to be tried; or as lords and judges to give and interpret the laws. On entering the court our gentlemen bowed, and then took stations where such could be found; for all the stools, backless chairs, and even bedsides of Dr. Sylvan's room, where we had convened, were filled; and like all ultra fashionables at a jam, some of us stood, till politeness, ne cessity, or whim in those seated and reclined, gave others a temporary seat. A dead calm ensued; we, of course, not knowing how to proceed with our prisoners, as we were in the predicament of the Pro-consul, who felt the awkwardness of sending a state prisoner to Cæsar and without any good accusation. But Mr. Clarence himself kindly relieved our embarrassment by breaking the ice thus:— “Gentlemen[35] [35] Paul himself said, “Most noble Felix;” and so “gentleman” is often a title of office. —We are here, though not as delinquents. We come, however, not merely willing, but even desirous that our whole official conduct may be subjected to the most rigorous and minute investigation. We are confident, if popular clamour be disregarded, and improper interference be disallowed, we are confident we can make the College; and, if it must be a reason for the aid or silence of some, we can make the town. We are ready then, to give ample and minute explanations to the Board; or answer any question of any of its members about our plans, rules, maxims—in short-our whole discipline; and are sure that the more —” Here the Major and without rising broke in—“this is all very fair, Mr Clarence, but the Board—(the Major was no member)—think you have been hasty and partial; and I myself, think, as my son has been unjustly used, you ought to give some satisfaction —” “I question, your right, Major Thorntree,” rejoined Clarence, to speak thus in the Board; but we waive our objection; and if it will satisfy you or the Board, we submit to what you may be pleased to call and consider a trial.” “Well, sir, will you allow the students to appear as witnesses?” “Willingly even—that! And yet I know not that such a request ought to surprise us more than all the proceedings. Yes, call in all the students—let them say what is true— we invite the truth.” Some one here asked if the boys should take an oath!! “No, sir! no, sir! no!”—said Clarence—“by no means —every consideration is against it! No! let them speak on honour what they know or even believe to be truth! And beside, we pledge our honour that we will never remember to their prejudice whatever disparaging things may be said by them as witnesses.” A whisper of approbation began to buzz around our lobbies; which sussurration reaching the People without, was answered by a gentle “hurrah! for the Fakilty!” At this the Major was a leetle disconcerted. But as he had a little modesty that was natural. He, then, remarked:— “You seem in good spirits, gentlemen,”—(Clarence and Harwood,)—“yet if I am allowed to bring in all the testimony, your confidence may be weaker. But how shall the boys give their testimony, sir?” “I will tell you, sir,” replied Clarence: “place a chair there:—now call in every boy, without exception, and in any order deemed satisfactory—do not omit even the two suspended boys. Then, let the boy in the chair for the time, first tell an uninterrupted story; then let the Major, or any member of the Board, ask any questions, leading or otherwise, that he may wish; and then let Professor Harwood and myself have the same privilege, and —” “That's fair! if it ain't, bust my rifle!”—was heard from without, manifesting a change in favour of the right. And that, as was always the case, had a corresponding effect on matters within. Hence I ventured now on no injudicious interference. The Major, too, was evidently awed by this voice of his masters: and, perhaps, certain of our young folks were thus aided in speaking the truth, or at least not suppressing it. Whether Clarence designed to be so politic is not for me to say;—but we lived in a log-rolling country—and even the best of men will manage in emergencies. Indeed, our Board and its Major, only wanted the vox populi: and Clarence only contrived to make their god speak—ass though it often be. The students, introduced one by one into the chair, (with a few exceptions,) gave a united testimony in favour of the Faculty: and even young Crabstick said nothing against them, save that, they ought not to have suspended him—and yet, as it was over, he said, he intended to return to school! The other sprout, Thorntree, refused to appear. The Major, thus far disappointed, now proposed to call in the citizens as witness, as “wrong had been done by the Faculty! but that boys stood naturally in awe of their teachers!! and, therefore, they did not like to tell all they knew!!!” Clarence then remarked:—“Had not our amazement all been used up, gentlemen, we should certainly be aghast at this!—but, be it so—let our fellow-citizens all come in; and without an oath! We know ten thousand idle rumours are afloat:—but, if every honest man will honourably and fearlessly, like a backwoodsman, state exactly, and neither more nor less than what he himself personally has seen, heard, and knows about Mr. Harwood and myself, in all our dealings and intercourse with them as citizens, as men, as teachers, as Christians—I say, call them in—call them in—we are ready —” (Outside.) “Pick my flint—if I know any thing agin the fakiltymen arter all —” “Nor me nuther—bust my rifle if I do!” “Well—all I know, I heern Patchin's ole-womun a-say-in' she heerd say they was powerful ristocratty —” “I'm sentimentally of opinyin, Ned, thare ain't no use a-goin' in, if a feller doesn't know nothun of himself.” “Bust my rifle, if we're quite sich fools!” “Agreed—them's my sentiments!” “Me too!” This thunder on the proper side from the politicians' god, was operating to the immediate and honourable discharge of our prisoners; and, perhaps, with an apology for the trouble caused them; when the Major announced one citizen as ready to state on his own knowledge, things adverse to the Faculty. “Who is it, sir?” demanded Clarence. “Mendax Liebug.” “Mr. Liebug! and does Major Thorntree ask this honourable Board to believe without an oath, a person not admissible in yonder court-house as a witness even with an oath? No Atheist shall ever testify semi-judicially either for or against me: and I trust, gentlemen, this will not be permitted—but, if otherwise, be the consequences what they may, the instant Mr. Liebug enters that door as a witness, I take my departure out of this.” Several members of the Board expressed approbation of Clarence's sentiments: and the people, led by the Hoosier that swore by his rifle, all allowed “it would be most powerful onfair to ask folks to believe any body without swearin', who couldn't take a legal affidavy.” And Mr. Mendax Liebug was not admitted. As a last attempt to demolish the Faculty, the Major said he would rest the whole on one question and answer, if Mr. Clarence was willing. “I am willing, sir,”—said Clarence,—“proceed.” The people crowded to hear, won by our Principal's candour and readiness—two things all potent with genuine woodsmen:—and then the Major, with a triumphant flourish, went on:— “Mr. Clarence, you are a preacher; and the Bible directs us to do to others as we would be done by:—well, sir, recall your boyish days, and put yourself in my son's place; and, how would you have acted, in view of what you deemed small laws, and how would you have regarded a Faculty, that had acted as you have just acted towards my son?” “Why, sir,” said Clarence, in reply, “I should have acted just as thoughtlessly as your son has acted, and as most young men every where occasionally act:—I should, then, probably have broken the laws and abused a Faculty; and, of course, merited and received what your son merited and received—discipline. Thus I thought and should have done when `a child;' but having become a man, I have put away childish things, and have dealt with your son now, as men ought to have dealt with me then.” “Hah! haw!—perttee powerful smart feller! if that ain't a fair answer, bust my rifle! Come, boys, let's be off—I allow Clarinse and t'other fakilty-man kin manudge collige better nor us. Who's goin' squirrillin'--no use wastin' time here no longer no how!” And so away went the people; and away went the Trustees; and away went the Faculty. But the Major and they first shook hands, in sign of forgiveness and amity: yet young Thorntree was not sent back to school, and the Major was ever more suspected as an enemy, than loved as a friend. The next day, honest Rifle-bust walked into my store, and began as follows:— “Well—bust my rifle, Carltin, if I wa'rn't most teetotally and sentimentally wrong 'bout that fakilty thing. Here, I've brung a dozen squirl for your ole-woman—and I want the worth on 'em in lead. I'll not settle our whole 'count now—but next week I'll get that hoss-beast for you, and in sang time I'll likkefy all —” “Oh! no odds, Ned! I didn't fear an honest man:— 9* only use your own eyes and ears, and you'll do people justice—here's your lead. Now just step in and see Mrs. Carlton, and she'll play you a tune.” Accordingly, in went Ned; and directly up struck the piano—not with any of your new-fangled fandangos, but with those primitive movements—“Polly put the Kettle on”—and—“Go to the D— and shake yourself,” and so forth: and soon could be plainly heard Ned kicking to pieces my rag carpet, in what he called a dance; and then Mrs. Carlton's merry laugh, as Ned gave a vernacular version of “the rumpus 'tween Clarinse and the Major and t'other fakilty-man,” and ended with his “sentimentul opinyin that the Majur was most teetotally discumflisticutted, and near about as good as chaw'd up.” Our Board, after this disturbance, met and enacted a code of laws for the guidance of the Faculty, and ordained, among other matters, that for a first offence, should be private admonition: for the second, public admonition; and for the third, suspension! This beautiful gradation had been mentioned in some venerable old woman's Prize Essay on Education; and was supposed to embody the quintescence of all experience in the art of government. It was not, indeed, stated whether the same offence was to be committed three times; or three different offences; or if the same must be done by three different pupils in succession, or by one three times, to secure the benefits of suspension. Nor was any thing said about the age, the understanding, the knowledge, the temptations, the aggravations of an offender and offence. And no notice was taken of looks, words, gestures, &amp;c. &amp;c.—any or all of which often accompany one offence, and make it equal to three—ay, to three times three! Hence our skilful application of patent gum and gammon for the teaching of teachers, wrought as the Faculty predicted—two offences of the same kind were repeatedly committed by the boys collectively and individually, and private and public admonitions were as plenty as beach-nuts; while the ingenuous youth instead of doing an old sin once more, did a new one twice! Indeed, nothing was more sport than to get admonition No. 2; for the “fellows” had come to see plain enough that the Faculty were not really masters unless the pupils should be silly enough to give them that advantage. In this state of affairs, a relative of Liebug's entered the school and purposely committed offence No. 1. Now No. 1 had been twice committed by other boys, and had been duly rebuked—and so No. 1 was decided by the Faculty in this case, owing to the great effrontery of young Brass, to be really No. 3. And, therefore, Mr. Brass, jun. was promptly suspended for one week. Immediately Mr. Brass, sen. determined to have a meeting of our Board. But we, now convinced that the old woman's or the impertinent Mr. Boston's patent-twaddlerules, could not be made to measure into all the sinuosities and around all the angles of behaviour in merry and cunning lads; and that after all, well qualified teachers were as competent to judge of things as pert writers or Taylorian lecturers, or persons that have conducted infant-schools, or short-hand schools, or steam schools of ever so many horse power—we now refused to be called. Whereupon Mr. Brass, sen. in order to spite the rats, went and established a Sunday-school in his own house, and taught there gratuitously male and female Owenism! And not satisfied with this revenge, he once, in my store, tried to overcome professor Harwood in an argument on the truth of the Christian religion; but in this attempt he was utterly discomfited, and to the amusement of the auditors seated on my counters. Wherefore, Mr. Brass, sen., advanced to where Mr. Harwood reclined, and calling up the late suspension of young Brass, he said he had now “a powerful d— mind to thrash him for it.” This was quite a favourite mode of arguing in the Purchase and required much bodily strength and agility. How learned men of slender bodies, pale faces, small hands and green spectacles would have felt, in prospect of rencontre with such a bear, is doubtful; but our professor, although dressed in store cloth and rather dandy-looking, betrayed no emotion, and never altered his half-recumbent attitude. Yet plain was it, from the flash of his grey eyes, and the hard compression of his lips, he was ready to ward off his antagonist—perhaps, even to spring on the threatening brute. This Bruin Brass perceived; and when Mr. H. cooly replied “very well, sir; try it—but maybe you'll find your mistake in that argument, as quick as you did in the other,”—he affected to laugh the whole off as a joke! And happy! if he valued sound bones; for my friend Harwood was a fine square built muscular young Kentuckian, from early life used to every feat of strength and agility, and able now to lift a barrel of flour in his unaided arms, and carry it before him and without trip or pause full fifty honest yards! Even the Spiritual Church may put defensive and carnal weapons into her children's hands to keep at a distance the sanctimonious assassins and murderous snivellers of a canting and unholy apostacy; and so cases do arise, where scholars may and ought to repel club logic with knockdown argument. Yea and nay, an atheistic bear when about to use violence must be, if possible, resisted with physics, even as the veritable shaggy-coat himself; metaphysics, here, may come afterwards. My friend Harwood had conducted the debate as a Christian and a gentleman; and the double rebuke given the atheist, while it had no tendency to change his heart, quelled his beastly spirit and controlled its ferocity; and ever after our Faculty were free from all fear of Mr. Brass, sen., and all trouble from Mr. Brass, jun. CHAPTER LII. “You'd scarce expect one of my age, To speak in public, on the stage; And should I chance to fall below Demosthenes, or Cicero, Don't view me with a critic's eye, But pass my imperfections by.” A general truce and cessation of arms had taken place, and our Faculty began to drill the quiescent pupils for a grand exhibition to come off this fall. This was to be, as is everywhere usual, of speeches, debates and compositions. Amendments may be necessary; but all experience and reason itself favour generous emulation and honest rivalry in schools; and nothing better prepares for the stormy conflicts of life than the literary sham fights of college societies. It is preposterous to train children for a world of romance, or for a state possible, IF all were good. Beside, manly competition is intrinsically right; and is promotive of many virtues—and all ought early to be inured to arduous and noble contests for masteries. The opposite doctrine is hateful for its puling effeminacy; and at war with our nature (as God made it,) and with the Scriptures. Thus thought our Faculty; and so they acted—although evils incident to their course, as to all other excellences in this life, were not wanting. In due time then, came the week of examinations and exhibition; and all was turned into bustle and merriment in fitting our Court-house for the great occasion! How joyous such times to boys—ay to men who retain the fresh and healthy feelings of boyhood! But to our half-reclaimed young savages—oh! it was a time of exu berant joy in all its phases of fun, frolic, raillery, joke, and expectation! And soon all Woodville caught the infection; and all were desirous of sharing the work and speculating on its progress. As for Carlton, he could not “tend store;” and so leaving his boys to sell what they could, and devour the remnant of the raisins and candy, away went our dignified author, and soon contrived to be elected by the boys Grand Master of Ceremonies in general, and Stage Fixings in particular! Then what a hauling of boards, and planks! What a streaming over to the Court-house of rag-carpets, and calico window curtains! Oh! the clatter of candlesticks!—the pitching of these and other articles on pounds of tallow candles done up in brown paper and tow strings! Gemini! the thundering of plank a-throwing down from two boys' shoulders, or a-upsetting from a cart! Cancer! the whacking! the pounding and nailing! the sawing and hammering and jerking! the talking! laughing! screeching! tearing! stamping! quizzing! It was a glorious chaos! Soon, however, from confusion, came order; and in less than two whole days, all was ready! a short time considering; for though we were thirty persons, only half worked, the rest being occupied in making the fun and hindering. The work was, first, the stage. This was erected between the doors of entrance into the court-room and opposite the forum or judges' seat—that honourable place being transformed into an orchestra, our music being to be three fiddles and one triangle. The stage-floor was spread with rag-carpets, and the boxing of the stairs ascending each from a door to the second story[36] [36] Vid. Vol. I. was adorned with calico curtains tastefully festooned—the special performance of some young ladies just returned from being finished in a boarding school of the far East! Front of the stage, in a row were candles in appropriate stands; the tallest candles at the ends, and the shortest in the centre, thus presenting a graceful curve of light! And all the stands were decorated with fancy papers curled and cut and frissled most fantastically;—the work of Miss Emily Glenville's boarding-school misses! Under the calico festooning stood Windsor chairs for the Faculty and the two rival societies! And near Professor Harwood's seat, was a cow-bell of a very soft and mournful voice, whose use was to ring out signals for the fiddles and the triangle—not a classic signal truly, yet one to which our musicians were accustomed, and not wholly at variance with the harmonies produced. Indeed, even to our own cultivated ears never came sounds so delicious as those of a cow-bell, which once ravished me with its sudden tinkle when lost in the woods! Hence as associations like utilities render things pleasant, our cow-bell signal was not unacceptable to our woodsmen. It was, also, a peculiar link connecting rough and softened life; and it forcibly reminded us of the milk of human kindness! Our seats. These were of doubled planks, resting on joist, logs, benches, or other planks placed edgeways. Of these, not one cracked, split, or tumbled over during the exhibition: hence, considering their loads and the stamping they endured in the applauses,—and every thing was applauded,—we have proof that our work was well done, if not expeditiously. On the evening preceding the exhibition, the Rev. Principal Clarence entered my store to obtain a pair of pumps, wishing to tread the stage in elastic style; and nothing so conduces to this ease and grace as a handsome stocking and a becoming shoe. Yet, in vain, was every drawer, trunk, or box containing either shoe or shoe-leather rummaged and re-rummaged, no pump turned up: and the gentleman was about to withdraw and make up his mind to walk the boards in a shapeless two-soled pair of calf-skin boots. But just then I had mechanically opened a drawer of female shoes; when some very large and coarse moroccos appeared, with straps to be joined by a steel buckle, and Clarence exclaimed:— “Stop! Carlton, the very thing!” “Where?” “Why, those machines of the softer sex.” “Ha! ha! he!—what! wear a woman's shoe?” “Certainly—if I can find any small enough—” “Buckle and all?” “Oh! no: my wife will razee the straps, and then the affairs will look masculine enough; and we can tie them with ribbon, pump-fashion.” “That will answer, I do believe: sit down and try.” A pair was selected, yet perversely bent on spreading sideways, when pressed with the foot; but that tendency, it was hoped, would be corrected by the new mode of tieing: and hence the man of learning departed with his bargain. That night the shoes were cropped; and the Principal, by way of rehearsal, was walking in them in his parlour, when in came several senior pupils to make some inquiry about the exhibition. In a moment the transmuted articles caught their eyes, and so captivated their fancy that they must ask whence were procured shoes so light and tasteful? On learning, and being taught how the sex could be so readily changed, off set they for my store: and the consequence was, that soon all the students came for morocco non-descripts, and we sold during the next day about thirty pairs! Hence I became a more decided friend of the college than ever. Yes, academies are useful! I cleared by this one speculation just thirty dollars! True, I lost about five dollars by not charging the usual New Purchase per centage: but then we must sacrifice something for the advancement of learning, and virtue is not always profitable! The grand evening came at last: and long ere candle light, our young gentlemen—(gentlemen, surely, when about to speak in ladies' shoes)—could be seen running into and out of and around the court-house, busy as bees, and with sundry bundles and packages. For, rain being threatened, it had been concluded to dress and put on the fine shoes up stairs, one society occupying the jury room, the other the council chamber. Finally, the signal for assembling was given by the school bell, half a mile distant, and by a tin horn in the centre of Woodville, being the sacred trumpet lately blown to convoke us to the exhibitions at the camp-meeting: and then in rushed all Woodville to fill the vacant seats. But strange! the vacant seats had been filled an hour before; enough girls and young ladies having been smuggled in by the gallant students and a few Woodville bucks. And among the number there sat the ladies of the Professors' families —and all the girls of Miss Glenville's establishment—and that important personage herself—and Mrs. Carlton—and even Aunt Kitty Littleton herself, done up in a bran new crimped cap and pink ribbon! As to Mr. Carlton, in consideration of his superintendance and his musical penchant, he was honoured with a windsor chair in the orchestra, and adjacent to the fiddles and triangles! Indeed, Dan Scrape had invited Mr. C. to play: although the honour had been declined, first, because J. Glenville, who had borrowed our flute and fiddle, had come over to the exhibition and forgotten to bring back the instruments!—(sub rosa, he left them behind purposely)— secondly, Mr. C. could not play any instruments but his own; and thirdly, Mr. C. was afraid, as he had never practiced with Dan, that he could not “keep up,” and so on. When we and the fiddles and triangles entered a little late and through a back window, behold! a dozen of the “rabble” were crowded into our sacred enclosure!—(Notice here, in public places all that cannot get into seats are rabble.) However, after I had squeezed into my windsor chair, along side the leading fiddle, Dan whispered for my consolation, and with a smile and a wink—“Never-a mind, Mister Carltin, we'll fix it afore long.” As if by magic, at a private signal, forth blazed the candles in front of the stage; and some two dozen others stuck to the walls by double pronged forks: and then to us was displayed the whole audience, and to them the stage and its fixins. In some points this audience was similar to others; but it contained more gems in unpolished and dull caskets than some eastern congregations. Hoosiers, Woolverines, Buckeyes, and the like, were present, and of the most unbrushed, unpomatumed, unadulterated sorts—purer than are there now: for, like the red aborigines, the white and brown sorts are fast disappearing! Poor fellows! that very night they witnessed the entrance of what would become their ruin! Unused to the glory of polished candlesticks, and cut and frizzled papers, all eyes momentarily gazed upon the stage in silent wonder! In the next instant, and with one consent, burst such a hurrah, as cracked the ears of the groundlings—yea! shook the glass in the windows! It did seem the very walls would be split! Nor was it a mere hurrah; for many an Indian fighter was present that night; and these sent out such yells and war cries as made one instinctively clap his hand to his head to ascertain if the scalp was safe! Following the uproar came the modest buzz of individual wonderments and critiques, such as:—“Look at that yallur one, Joe!”—“Most powerful shiney them are!”—“Ain't them are red things rity-dity poseys?—“Law! no Dick, them's paper fixins!”—“Well, I never?”—“I say, Jake, ain't them danglins up there like Carltin's ole woman's curtins!”—“Pick my flint!”—“Darn my leggins—its powerful big-buggy!”—“How'd them lite so quick?”—“Dipt in tarpentine—don't you smell it?” But in the midst appeared descending, the rival societies, each by separate stairs: each headed by a Professor; and entering simultaneously each at oppposite parts of the stage! And when all were seated, the Faculty in the centre, and the students right and left, the smallest next and the largest at the extremities; all in new suits of store cloth, and with appropriate badges gracefully inserted through button holes, and waving triumphantly from their arms also; all in starched collars and black neck ribbons; and all in female slippers, and so altered as to pass for males—the yells of greeting were absolutely terrific! Professor Harwood was now seen shaking the cow bell: but though its mellow tinkle was inaudible, the fiddles and triangles, seeing the pendulum motion, knew what was needed: and hence they essayed to strike up Hail Columbia! Still nothing of a tune could be heard; although from the bewildering activity of bows and elbows, it was manifest something nice was doing; till by dint of sight in some, and bawlings out of “Silence!” by others, the audience in the pit became quiescent. In the interm, we of the orchestra began to have more room: for most of the rabble near the fiddlers, especially near Dan, the Primo, had got hints to make room, in the form of hits, some in the stomach, some in the face and eyes, and some under the lugs—all of course naturally required by the laws of motion and melody! Indeed, it was plain enough that there was more danger in standing so near good fiddlers than folks had ever imagined! And, therefore, our uninvited soon compressed into one corner; and from a sincere wish not to incommode the music! And thus, by the kindness of Dan, whose wink and smile were now understood and his mode of “fixin it,” I enjoyed my windsor chair in ampler space; at least while tunes were executed. For this kindness, and because our executioners were so essential to the exhibition, we shall hand them down in history—they shall be immortalized! Dan Scrape, the fiddle primo, was by far the prince of the New Purchase catgut and horsehair men. Like Paganini, he could play on one string, if not an entire tune, yet parts of nearly two dozen tunes—his whole stock! And like that maestro, he played without notes, and with endless variations and embellishments! Ay! and he played no worse on one shift or position than another! Still, Dan differed from the Italian in some things; for instance, he held his fiddle against his breast, (perhaps out of affection,) and his bow in the middle, and like a cart-whip; things enabling him, however, the more effectually to flog his instrument when rebellious; and the afflicted creature would scream right out in agony! Indeed his Scremonah bore marks of premature old age—its finger-board being indented with little pits, and its stomach, (vulgarly, in the East, the belly,) was frightfully incrusted with rosin and other gummy things, till it looked as dark and care-worn as Methusaleh! Dan was, truly, no niggard of “rosum,” for he “greased,” as he termed it, between his tunes every time! and then at his first few vigorous jerks, fell a shower of dust on the agitated bosom of his instrument, calling out in vain for mercy under the cruel punishment! Dan's main difference from Paganini was in using his left hand to bow. And yet this better enabled him to make room; for persons going to the left for safety, met the accidental hits where lest expected,—like Ehud, who not noticing the left hand of Shamgar, got what English bullies call his gruel, from the wrong quarter! Let us not, however, do Dan injustice. He certainly did, out of benevolence, administer some wilful and hard blows, and yet keep an unconscious phiz; but when Dan was fairly possessed with the spirit of fiddling, he never even dreamed he had an elbow! Then his arm was all elbow! The way it jumped up and down! and darted back and forth!—the velocity was too dizzy to look at! But then, if a spectator valued his eyes, let him stand clear of the bow's end!—not the point, that was always safe enough on the strings—but the heel or slide end, which never visiting the fiddle, was ever flourishing about almost invisible, with reckless indifference and the force of a bullet! In truth, Dan always fiddled like a race-horse; and if he got one bar's start, I defy any body to have ever over-taken him! But some favourite tunes he played like a tornado; such as “the Irish Washerwoman,”—and above all, that satanic rondo, “the D. among the T's. And I know this is not exaggeration; for once on my asking Hunting Shirt Andy, who was a good judge, what he thought of Dan's playing, he unhesitating declared that “Dan Scrape played the fiddle like the very devil!” The second fiddle was a pupil of Dan's. And the master had evidently taken great pains with his—finger-board, it being crossed with white paint to guide the pupil's fingers, who still usually hit wide of the mark in his haste to overtake his teacher! He is called second fiddle, not because he did alto or tenor, but because he was usually behind the first fiddle in time; nay, he was sometimes so utterly lost, that Dan would tell him to stop, and “start in when the tune kim round agin!” Some may think these defects made discords; but then this was compensated by the two fiddles never being tuned alike, accuracy of stop being thus rendered less important; and above all, because the exquisite triangle completely obliterated, filled up, and jingled into one all mistakes, vacancies, and discords! I shall only further remark, that the professor of the triangle was actually self-taught! and yet he could outjingle any thing of the sort I ever heard, even if aided by the cymbals and musical bells! “But what of the third fiddle?” Let Dan answer, who, after the execution of Hail Columbia, thus whispered me:—“Tim Scratch know'd better nor to come! he's not sick no how—it's all possum! He's no fiddler! I kin out fiddle him if he lives for ever and a day longer—and plays on Sundays!” And so it was: and neither Mr. Carlton nor any other man who values reputation ought to play with Dan Scrape. The Reverend Principal Clarence now arose, and in pumps and silk stockings advanced and made something like the following address:— “Ladies and gentlemen”—(a kind of don't-gentleman-me-look of certain hearers, made him add)—“and my respected fellow-citizens, we rejoice to meet so large an assembly and so full of good spirits, come to attend our first exhibition. It is natural you should be here: it is your own school, and these are your own sons and relatives, who are now to show before you their improvement to-night. We are here, fellow-citizens, to witness what Western boys can do; and let me say, that while far from perfection, our boys, if not embarrassed, will not disgrace our wooden country. We say embarrassed; for any confusion or noise accidentally made by our respected fellow citizens present, in time of a speech or other exercise, will hinder our unpractised speakers from doing themselves justice. We depend, of course, on the honour of our hearers, not giving any order on the subject, or making even a request, as is often necessary in the East; because here, in the free West, where all do as they please, Backwoodsmen naturally behave according to the maxims of good sense.”— (“Bust my rifle! if that ain't the truth,” interrupted Ned,— “we'll show 'em how to behave, Mr. Fakilty!”)—“Just as I said, stranger,”—resumed Clarence—“and, therefore, we shall say no more, but will instantly proceed with the exercises.” This was ferociously clapped and stamped; and then the exercises proceeded, the cow bell being duly rung, first for the music to begin and then for it to cease. In the latter case the bell owed its efficiency to Mr. Carlton, as Dan was always more ready to begin than to finish a tune. And hence, and as the orchestra was louder than the bell, we went by sight; but Dan never could see the wag of the bell, till Mr. C. gave him a hunch on the off-side; and then his Scremonah hushed up, like a cholicy child that had screeched itself to sleep! Had Mr. Carlton been on the bow-side, he must have poked Dan with a stick, or met something tragical; but like the fox in æsop, he had learned from the hits of others. It is unnecessary to detail the events of that memorable night. All the students were applauded; and not a few with the admixture of Indian yells, so like the savage-savage, that the animals could, like the ass-lion, be detected only by the skin! Certain speeches, too, political in their nature, and admirably delivered, caused the audience to lose sight of the exhibition, and hurrah for Jackson or Clay as on the election ground. And these speakers, with one exception, became politicians, and are even yet, most of them, figuring before the world. The people generally behaved as Ned Stanley, (our friend Rifle-Bust) promised, and as Western folks always do behave, if one shows a disposition to conciliate and will employ a little innocent flattery; not that they are deceived by such, but that they take it as a sign of your desiring to please and put them on honour. Let, however, a self-complacent gentleman, full of city importance and strut essay, in a dictatorial way, to manage a free and wild assembly in the world of woods and prairies —and if he is not shut up in a manner that shall clean wipe the conceit out of him, then is my opinion a mistake. He may order a hackman, or a porter, or a quill-driver, or a sawyer—but if he dare order freemen of the forests and the meadows, they will ride him on a rail; and, in spite of his stocks, brick houses, fine equipage, whiskers and curled hair! The speeches, excepting a few humourous ones, were all original; and equal to the best in our schools and colleges concocted from the living and the dead. Generally the young men of a New Purchase are superior to the young gentlemen of old settlements, in both scholarship and elocution; and for the following reasons: 1. The young men come to learning as a novelty. It is opposite to the monotony of woods, cabins, pork, corn, and axes. Hence nothing exceeds their interest and curiosity; and it is long, under a judicious teacher, before the novelty ceases; and afterwards the habit of hard studying supplies the place. 2. The young men regard learning as the lever to elevate them—or by which the New World may cope more fairly with the Old. Hence, day and night, they work vi et armis at the machine; until they even get higher than the young gentlemen who work lazily and feebly. 3. The young men have more energy than the young gentlemen; and this directed by enthusiastic masters in learning produces great results. 4. New Purchases have few temptations to idleness and dissipation. Indeed, as war among the Spartans, so Colleges there are to the young men recreations, and more delightful than anything else. 5. Ten dollars a year—the tuition fee—was too hard for our young men to obtain, lightly to be squandered. And ten dollars with us would buy ten acres nearly; hence they who value land as a great earthly good, spend not a small farm once a year for the privilege of being idle. Young gentlemen often waste two such a year on sugar candy! 6. Young men are inquisitive like yankees; and hence, they ask endless questions not contained in Parley-books. And by this method of torturing professors, more is often extracted than by torturing nature. 7. Young men out there are in more immediate contact with professors; hence, if the professors be themselves men, the advantages of the old Roman way of education may be combined with the modern ways. We have seven more reasons, which, however, we shall not inflict in the First edition; but to fortify the seven and to conclude the exhibition, we shall present minute accounts of two young men, who were among our stars. And as these stars still shine, the one fixed, the other wandering, in the political firmament, we may only designate them as the George and the Henry. George possessed not uncommon talents; unless perseverance be a talent, and that he did possess in so great a degree as to make it a substitute for genius. He is our fixed star. Many knew of his untiring patience and plodding diligence, and were impressed with a belief he would, after all, make something; but none expected him to shine forth to night a star of the first magnitude. Not only was he great compared with himself, but with all others; and his composition on the life, character, and writings of Cicero was admirably written and most happily spoken. I was myself amazed, fired, captivated, and even instructed; and, after the exercises ended, I sought him, for he was one of my favourites, and said: “Why George! you did nobly! surely that composition cost you no small labour?” “Thank you, Mr. Carlton. As to the piece—(I have no desire to pass for a genius)—it did cost me thought and labour—I carefully studied and re-wrote it thirty-six times.” Vol. II.—10 Well! that was one young Man. The other, Henry, although never among my favourites, will even more forcibly sustain our reasons. In a pecuniary sense, he was a poor boy even for the Purchase; and lived, in homely phrase, from hand to mouth. Indeed the loss of a day's job, made his mouth that day debtor for its food; and hand, on the next occasion, did double duty. He was, however, rich in expedient, and hesitated at no job, odd or even; although, it is to be regretted, he did not sometimes refuse employments not strictly honourable. And yet even that may be palliated. But no apology can ever atone for his occasional ingratitude and even positive injury to benefactors, when a few dollars were the price gained by his desertion of duty and honour. No sooner, however, had the Seminary been organized, than Henry determined to obtain a good education. He had credit enough to procure some decent clothes and necessary books; but as five dollars, cash, and in advance, were to be paid to our Treasurer, Henry was forced to look for a few lucrative jobs; and hence, he one morning presented himself at my store and commenced: “Well, Mr. Carlton, I've got books and clothes; but I've no silver to pay the session-bill—kin you give a feller no job what will bring silver?” “Really, Henry, I don't know that I can;—but stay! we've lost our cow—will you take half a dollar a day in cash to look her up?” “Ay! will I;—when did she put out?—what kind of a crittur is she?—which way, think she went? &amp;c., &amp;c.” Satisfied as far as possible in his inquiries, away went the lad to the woods. At the end of two days he came back, cowless, indeed, but after a painful search through thickets, along creeks, and over hills; and during which, he had camped out alone in the night. Our hero had thus one dollar of the tuition fee. About this time we had ceased from digging a well, after finding no water at twenty-five feet; although we had employed a great hazel-wizzard; and his rod had repeatedly turned down over the spot, and that so hard as to twist off a little of the bark. Even the diviner was quite at a loss to account for the failure; insisting yet the water must be lower, as “his rod never twisted so powerful arnest if they want water somewhere!” Now Henry was of the same opinion; and, therefore, bringing Mr. Hum, the wizzard (or witch, there so called) to me, the two prevailed on me to go only four feet lower —Henry undertaking the job at fifty cents per foot! I had supposed the boy would have a comrade to work his windlass; but no, down went Henry alone with the necessary implements; and after digging, and breaking, and prying, and shovelling, up the ladder he came, let down his empty bucket, descended, filled the bucket, reascended, wound up his load, and so on, till he had cleared out “his diggins!” And away he went again to work with hammer and sledge, bar, spade, shovel, and bucket; till, within a week, our well was four feet deeper and Henry two dollars richer! But although water was “somewhere,” it had not risen in our part of the world;—the bottom of the pit was still as dry and comfortable as an oven! Our hero in similar ways procured the other two cash dollars; and by the aid of some student's mastering in private several elementary studies, he was, at the opening of the next session, matriculated as something more than a Freshman. And now, while attending his regular studies, he still by jobbing maintained his mouth and laid by a few dollars for books and future tuition fees. He contrived even to be appointed sub-deputy librarian of the Woodville Library, adding thus to his information and funds; and, as if all this were not enough, he one day waited on Mr. Clarence to ask if the school-laws would permit him to study law and remain a student! “Study law!—Henry?”—said Clarence. “Yes, sir; lawyer Cravings will find me books; and thinks in a year or two I can plead before magistrates. If it is not against the laws —” “Why, certainly we have no law against that; such a case was never imagined as probable or possible. Do, however, not neglect your regular college studies, and then, it is nobody's business what else you may study or learn.” Our young man, sure enough, went to work at the law, Hooser-fashion indeed, and still attended well to his regular studies; and in two weeks before the exhibition, he did actually defend and win a cause before Squire Snab, and against and from the redoubtable lawyer Cravings himself —and, with the contingent fee, he paid our treasurer the tuition price of the next term! Very good, young gentlemen! laugh at all this if you please. But had you heard Henry, ranking now about Sophomore, deliver at the exhibition, his Speech on Man, you would have offered, as is usual in here, a price for it, in view of your Senior Speech! Come! I will bet you two dozen racoon skins against a pair of kid gloves, or even a pot of cold cream, that if you wrote your own speech, when you were graduated, it was not as good as his! CHAPTER LIII. “Such a noise arose, As the shrounds make at sea in a stiff tempest; As loud, and to as many tunes; hats, cloaks, (Doublets, I think,) flew up;—and had their faces Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy I never saw before.” Some may wish to know how our Faculty spent vacations in the woods. As to Clarence, in term time, he preached twice on Sabbath, and sometimes oftener; beside, lectures in the week, and the like,—but, in vacations, he commonly did more. This very vacation, he once walked five miles in the rain; preached an hour and a half in the open air; and then walked back the same distance to Glenville's new cabin, on the river. Our preacher was, what is called a laborious minister: and yet his ecclesiastical stipend, and that in trade, averaged only fifty dollars per annum! yea! he has even been without a morsel of food in his house, or a stick of wood for a fire—and, in a cold winter day, lay thus sick and deserted! Clarence, however, would laugh a little: but, then, for this, Carlton was usually to blame. Hence, we do hope “the brethren,” when reading this work, will be careful to condemn the right person—and that, not too severely; as the author, a somewhat ubiquitous man, has had the pleasure of hearing Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, as well as the inferior ministers, preachers, and exhorters, do secular laughing, beside “making merry” with friends, according to the Scriptures. Thus our Faculty, in vacations, did often, what classical people do elsewhere—nothing! Sometimes, they did next to nothing—smoking! and very often they did—cutting-up! And this last consists in craking nuts and jokes— racing one another, and slamming doors—in upsetting chairs, and even kicking up carpets! Great wisdom, however, and art and tact, and gentlemanly feeling, are requisite for the cut-up; and specially in knowing where and when to cease: and, of all men, to do the thing right, Harwood, Clarence, Glenville, and Carlton were just “the dandy!” If the affair is not done up to the point— it is teasing; if beyond—it is horse play; but if in medio tutissimi—it is the most tickling and exhilatory!—better to provoke laughter than all the jest-books in existence. The cut-ups were usually in wet weather. In dry times, our literati strolled into the forests; where mineralogy, botany, and natural history, suggested by dark masses of rough rocks, or curious stones and shells, never before handled by moderns; or by enormous wild flowers, with cups large enough to hold two thimbles-full of dew; or by a startled snake, ringing his warning under prostrate trunks on or near which the learned stood; or, by crackling brush and whirling leaves, where shone a streak of bounding wolf or glancing deer—became recreations detaining our friends till dinner was deferred until tea, and tea until supper, when all were devoured as one! Perhaps the mind never so marched towards the west, as once when Clarence and Harwood, and several visiting literati, were seen by the Author, all in a line, knee-deep and wading towards the occidental sun, through the fresh-fallen leaves; and thus discussing,—at one time, the Greek Tragedians,—at another, the Calculus and the Analytical Geometry! It was the only time the Author ever witnessed the Grand Abstraction embodied and embattled! And he feels elated as the White Man who talked—(in Judge Hall's Works)— to the very Indian whose great-paternal grandfather had actually heard of the man whose father had seen the skeleton of a Gopher! Often, too, would I seduce the Faculty into a hunt, by quoting the Greek of Xenophon, where Cyrus the Elder inflames his comrades, by descriptions of wild boars that rushed on the hunter's spear like warriors in battle, and of deer that leaped — oh! how high! But this vacation, I proposed a party, to visit and explore a cave just discovered by a hunter in pursuit of a fox, that darted down a sink-hole and disappeared, in an opening among some rocks. In any village is it difficult, but especially in a New-Purchase one, to keep such intention secret. Soon, then, was it bruited through Woodville, that Carlton was making up a party for the cave; when further invitation was useless, our main art now being to keep out some, whose “room was better than their company.” And this must be done without seeming to interfere with people's liberty of going where they liked. The prevention was partly accomplished by fixing on no definite day; and deferring, till some became weary of waiting and left town, or so engaged that going would then be impossible. Some, also, were specially asked; but not before it had been ascertained that small chance existed of their obtaining horses. This was the case with the Doolittles; who, as we rode by the morning of the expedition, answered somebody's[37] [37] This was young Capers Smileal; who was aware, I fear, how the matter was. He would do well in here among his relations the Smootheys and Glibs. expressions of regret that we should be deprived of the pleasure of their company, with—“Well! thank you all the same for the invite—next time we'll look up nags and critters a smart chance quicker!” Unexpectedly, one fine morning, the rising sun shedding horizontals of light and shade over our village, were revealed one dozen horses at Carlton's rack, and about an equal number in other places, accoutred and accoutring— (passively);—and, therefore, shortly after “sun up” where we could see him, a report was spread that Carlton's party was going to the cave to-day. But rumour was not long requisite to advertise; since every man, woman, boy, girl, and child of the party became, about 8 o'clock, A. M., a notifier, while our cavalcade dashed through the village, talking, cantering, whipping, joking, spurring, laughing! while some screamed, “come on, thare, behind!” and some, “not so blame fast, thar', in front!” and others in piteous accents, “La! if I ain't dropt my ridicul'!”— “Awh! stop! won't you?”—“This darn'd ole guth's a-bustin'!” Oh! it was a glorious hubbub! Alas! how dignity forgot decorum that delicious morning! Even our literati, the teachers of proprieties and all that, even they lost sight of Lord Chesterfield! Why, reader! they laughed outright like the vulgar! They rode with one foot only in a stirrup, and let the other dangle! They jumped down to pick up Polly Logrul's “bag as had her hankichif in!” And more—they pelted the girls at a distance with acorns, beech-nuts, and horse-chesnuts! switched Hoosier-dandies' horses, to make them kick-up! rear! run! and what not! And if the grave folks behaved so—what did the others? Ah! dear Precise! does happiness consist in skin-tight garments? in a hat or bonnet stuck to the pate in a style? in tying one's limbs to the dull earth by straps under boots? in moving with a graceful and pointed toe, and fingers curved and adjusted, and neck arched in magazine fashion? and in riding horses with trained gait—in smirking, and simpering, and lisping, by rule? If so: go not to a New Purchase! Above all, go not with the natives to explore a cave! Depend on it—you will break your straps! your corset-string, male or female! and derange your curls! Solemnly—it will spoil your looks!—those, at least, your milliner, and tailor, and perfumer gave you! But if no regard for your makers' reputations deter you—I tell you it will break your—necks! One may ride a trained horse, handsomely caparisoned, on macadamised ways, and sit perpendicular and graceful, while the beast does his theatrical starts and plunges at certain secret pulls, touches, and words: but put the same rider on the mischievous, unbroken, wild “crittur” of the woods, moving in a compound of all gaits, and starting, plunging, kicking, and biting extemporaneously; and on a saddle that does not fit, and with a girth that will break; and this in a gully road, a snaggy ravine, an impeded trace, or a tangled and pathless woods;—and then if the rider forget not dignity, and grace, and rules, adieu to his seat! and maybe adieu to whatever brains nature, or, more likely, Phrenology may have given him! Situations occur in both the moral and the natural worlds, where a man becomes a law unto himself—and such are often in the west. But this is digression. Our party was to consist of one dozen adults;—(children are never counted out there, but go, not as shadows—they are mere accretions)—yet spite of the effort to be exclusive, our select company swelled to nearly thirty! And this before we set out! and then so great was the excitement produced, that some who had abandoned the intention of going, suddenly resumed it; so, that just after our entering the woods, a clatter of hoofs and uproar of voices and leaves were close in the rear! and there was a handsome addition to the cave party of some dozen more! Among others, was a hunting crony of mine, Domore: and behind on his horse he carried two of the Doolittles! Other horses had duplex riders too; and when such all got into Indian file, nothing could be seen except legs on the ground kicking 10* dry leaves, and legs in the air kicking horse sides— that being answered instantly by a very venomous switching of horse tails, and an occasional and extra performance of horse heels. Perhaps the increased company was also owing to this: several affianced lovers were of the party; and rumour, with more of romance than reality, had said, that more than two couples were to be married in the cave under ground! Oh! what a temptation—a Hoosier wedding in a new-found cave! But the sternness of truth forbids; yet the Talemaquers must not steal this idea: when I write fiction I shall make a story out of it myself. Seven miles from Woodville we reached the cabin of the hunter, who had discovered the cave. Here we got ample directions; not, indeed, from the male hunter—he was absent—but from Mrs. Hunter. These are here condensed for the guidance of the reader, in case he may want to visit the cave for curiosity or consumption. DIRECTIONS OF MRS. HUNTER. “Well, stranjurs, I warn't never at that are cave; but I often heern him tell on it; and I allows I kin a sort a pint out the course ne'er on about as well as Bill himself kin. Now, look here—you must put off ahind the cabin down the branch till you amost about come to ole Fire-Skin's trace—(an Indian once trading there)—and thare a kind a take off a sort a so like—(pointing S. S. West)—and that'll bring you to Hickory Ridge; whare you must keep down like, but a sort a leetle barin up, till you strike B'ar Waller—(a creek)—and thare keep rite even on strate ahead till you gits to Rock-Ford—and some wher strate ayond is near about whare Bill fust seed the wolf or fox, I disremember which on 'em 'twas—but no odds no how—only foller on thare, a turning though left; and a leetle ayond is the sink holes:—and 'twas one on 'em the varmint tuk into—I dont't know the hole, but it is a powerful big one, and about as round as a sugar kittle.” In the party were folks that had killed turkeys on Hickory; fought bruins on Bear Wallow; hunted deer around Rock Ford; yet had we not fortunately encountered Bill himself, near Fire-Skin's trace, and received directions a little different, we should, indeed have found the sink holes —but not the cave. That was in a sink by itself, half a mile from the others, in size less than the least, and without any shape whatever—a place none save a fox or a hunter could ever have found! But that place, by Bill's directions, was reached. And now the nature of the next operation being better understood, our exploring party became small if not select. Some ten feet down, after scratching through briars and bushes, we espied a rat hole, or to make the most of it, an opening thirty inches long by eighteen wide; excepting where sharp points of rock projected and made the aperture an inch or two less. And this hole was the veritable door of the cavern! This was manifest from the worn trace of some kind of beasts; but mainly from Domore's report, who crawled in backward, and in five minutes crawled out head foremost, saying—“He backed in a rite smart chance, yet arter a while he finded he could a kinder sorter stand up—and then he kim out to sartify the kumpine.” Immediately commenced a metaphorical backing out: most of the ladies declared at once they never would crawl into such a place! Some also refused out of cowardice; and some were bound to refuse by tight corslets and other bandages. Yet some half dozen, and among them Mrs. Clarence and Mrs. Carlton, (who usually kept together,) defying natural and conventional objections, said they would follow the preacher, as he could exorcise foul spirits;[38] [38] That dirty work is better done now by his Holiness. and as to other inhabitants, they would leave them to Domore and the other brave hunters with us. Some gentlemen that wished to go in, had to remain with the recusant ladies: and some hardy bucks, with rifles, preferred hunting an hour or two “to crawlin on all fours under the airth like darn'd brute critturs!” But this was “Possum”—these latter feared to be cut out, and intended to stay above ground and improve the time in sparking. One affianced pair were so determined on the descent, and so resisted all dehortations, that some of the hide-bound were tempted to go along with us, under a suspicion that the lovers, if they went into the cave two, would return one: curiosity being nearly as strong as corsets!—but not quite. To all, however, it was strange poor Polly Logrul obstinately refused to go down; although her sweatheart was making ready to do so, and her rival, Peggy Ketchim, was to be of the crawling party! And when all knew Polly was neither nice nor timid; and would not hesitate to seize a wolf natural by the ears! But, reader, I was in the secret: —Polly was too large for the aperture! Hog[39] [39] Used here technically—not vulgarly. and hominy had enlarged her physics till poor Polly, who had hitherto triumphed in her size, now wished herself a more etherial sprite: for I accidentally saw her, when she supposed all at a distance, standing near the cave door, and convincing herself by a total blocking of the aperture by a part only of her form, that Peggy Ketchim would have Jesse—ah! in what unseen part of the underworld, that day, all to herself! At length all was ready. Then we formed in Indian file, faces outward and backs towards the entrance, and began slowly to retrograde from the sun-light. Domore led the rear; then came the braves; then backed in Professor Harwood, then Mr. Carlton, his wife following before him, and then Principal Clarence, with wife ditto: and then— “What then? How did the young ladies and gentlemen come down?” I could not see beyond Mr. Clarence. It was arranged, however, that the ladies should come in a line in front of Mrs. Clarence, and the young gentlemen bring up the van —like going up and down stairs in monuments and steeples to the east. Doubtless all backed in judiciously, as we heard no complaints: although there was incessant laughter, screeching, squealing, and the like; and an occasional exclamation, as—“You, Joe!”—“Awh! now Sam, let me be!”—“Go away—I don't want none o' your help!”— “Take that now!”—which last was followed by a hard slap on somebody's face, and instantly answered by— “Darn it Peg! if you ain't a bustur!” The entrance was the grand difficulty; for on squeezing down a few yards, the rocks went down like irregular steps, and our heads began gradually to rise, till by our torches were seen the rocks above ascending in a similar way: and in about fifty feet from the aperture we could stand erect and look round on a vast cavern, widening in every direction. Here the rear awaited the centre, and then both, the van; and then all the torches being lighted, we could see more distinctly this terra incognita. Deep fissures were apparent in the rocks below, into which one might have fallen in the dark; but we met no accident, and continued now our advance to the Grand Saloon, or as Bill had called it, “the biggerest cave whare he couldn't see the top like.” On reaching the entry of this room, we clambered down some rough projecting rocks; and thence passing along two abreast for fifteen yards, we all stood safe in the Saloon itself. Here nothing was remarkable but the size. It was an apartment about eighty feet long and from fifteen to forty wide, the height varying from twenty to sixty feet—although in some places we could not discern any roof. Near one end, however, was a rock not unlike a pulpit,[40] [40] The author is aware of indistinctness here—but that is owing to the amazing variety in pulpits themselves. about four feet high and ascended by natural steps and encircled by a stony balustrade. The immediate consecration was proposed to our lovers. The gentleman, a store-keeper of Woodville, readily assented; but the mistress, a pretty and interesting young lady, positively declared “she was determined never to marry any where, but to die an old maid”—sure sign of course, that “the day was fixed;” for girls make no such silly and desperate speeches till either mature years arrive or the marriage is secretly arranged. When rallied on this point, she took the other tack and said, “if she did marry, it should be above the earth; for she didn't believe a marriage under it was legal; and for her part, when she could find a fellow worth having, she intended to adhere to him till death!” “Well!”—said Peggy Ketchim,—`I'd jist as leef marry the man I lov'd down here as not”—looking tender at Jesse, Miss Logrul's beau. Jesse, however, would not take, being yet vexed at the slap severely done to his face on the crawl-way; but he very ungallantly replied: “Well, darn it, if I wouldn't like the joke too, if Miss Logrul had ony kim down—” “Poll Logrul!”—(dixit Peggy)—“what's the use a her tryin to go through life with a feller, whom she couldn't squeeze into a cave.” Here were plainly symptoms of a squall, which it was expedient to overwhelm with a storm; hence I proposed to try the effect of a unanimous and vigorous “hurraw!” —and to ascertain if the party outside could hear our shouting. This was agreed; and then at the signal we let it out!—and oh! the uproar! inconceivable before, indescribable now! And the effect so different from noises in the world!—in a few moments hundreds of bats, hitherto pertinaciously adhesive to the rocks, took wing, and flying, with no discretion, they dashed in panic against our very faces and open mouths, and speedily extinguished more than half our torches. Many ladies would have fainted, and most would have screamed; but ours, knowing that noise had brought the evil, remained quiet; and hence the bats soon withdrew to their clinging, and our torches were relighted; and— “Hark!—what's that!?” “What?” “Listen!” We did, and heard an indistinct and peculiar noise— now like whining—now like growling—and then it seemed a pit-pat sound like padded feet! and it then died away, and we were left to our speculations. “Huh! haw!—its them blasted fellers outside a trying to sker the gals down here.” “Who knows if it ain't Bill's fox?” “'Spose it was Bill's wolf—hey?” At this ingenious suggestion, the ladies all in unaffected alarm, proposed an immediate retreat. Yet Domore and Jesse and half a dozen other chaps, said “they did want most powerful bad jist to see into the next room a little down like, afore goin back;” and hence the ladies kindly agreed to wait in the saloon, with a guard for their return. The explorers, then, set off; and for a time were heard their footsteps and merry voices, till all were hushed in the distance; and we in silence remained striving to catch yet some faint sound—when forth on a sudden came the burst of terrific screams and outcries from the exploring party! and that soon followed by the noise of feet coming back quicker by far than they had gone away! And then into the saloon jumped and tumbled the whole party, a few laughing and jeering, but most bawling out—“a Ba'r! a Ba'r!!” Our ladies, of course, added at first a scream; and there was some involuntary adhering to husbands' and lovers' arms; a little earnest entreaty to get out instantly; and then a rushing towards the egress of the cave, and then a rushing back, as darkness in that direction became visible, and bats' wings flapped again into faces; yet in no long time order was restored, and we listened to the following account from Domore. “Well! I tell you what naburs! if I warn't about as most powerful near a treadin on a darn black varmint of a ba'r, as most folks ever was I allow. You see, as we a kind a kim to that tother long hole, says I to Jess, Jess says I, you jist take this here light of mine here, and I'll go fust a head and feel along till we git's to that 'are room Bill tells on, whare he seed a crik a runnin across tother end, says I. Well, so Jess he takes the light and we kim to whare you a kinder sorter go down a leetle, and I was je-e-st agoin so—(action)—to put down one leg this a way so, a holdin on so—(clinging to the pulpit)—above like, and I sees the rock b'low a most powerful black and dark, and I thinks as maybe it mought be a deep hole;—and with that says I to Jess, Jess says I, tote along that light a yourn—and then I holds it down this a way—(using his torch)—whare I was goin to step, and darn my leggins if the hole didn't seem a movinin and a movinin, till all of a quick up sprouted a ba'r's head! and his eyes a sort a starin so—(imitating)—rite slam smack on mine! Well Jess he seed him too, and the way he let out his squawk was a screecher I tell you! And then all them tother fellers what was ahind, darn em if they didn't squeel as if they was skulp'd!—and put out and make tracks for this here preachers' room! But you see, I've fit ba'r afore and I know'd this one warnt agoin to fite—and I seed him a put-tin off afore I kim away—and if I'd had one of them chaps rifles above ground, why you see if we wouldn't a cooked ba'r meat down here to day thar's no snakes.” “But Domore, suppose the bear had made battle?” “Well—Mr. Carltin, 'spose he had—do you see this?” —drawing from his jacket a very savage looking scalping knife. “Yes! yes!—Domore—and I would not have asked you, if I had known you had your knife.” “Well, you see, Mr. Carltin, I don't mean no 'fence— but that a sorter shows you don't know all about the woods yit—albeit you're a powerful feller with the rifle; a hunter doesen't go into timber without his knife, and never no how into sich like caves and holes as this here one.” Fears had now abated; and the ladies professed great confidence in my friend Domore's skill and bravery; still, it was voted to retire immediately into the world, and our line of retreat was as follows. 1. Nearly all the males, headed by Jesse, who, wishing to show his spunk and retrieve the disgrace of his “screecher,” led the van, now in front. 2. All the females. 3. The Faculty and Mr. Carlton. 4. And lastly, Domore as rear guard. Without memorable accident our van in due time gained the cave-door and crawled out head foremost; then, aided by the upper party collected around at the unexpected egress, they helped out the female incumbents; and then, amid united congratulations and derisions, we, the last division were ushered slowly once more into ordinary life. “But where's Domore our rear guard?” “Oh! I hear him, or something else, pushing out—he makes powerful little head way tho'—maybe he's draggin a ba'r—he's mighty fussy with something and very onactive.” By this time our whole party had come around the aperture and were with great interest eyeing the spot to greet our hero—when—could it be!—the hole was suddenly blocked up!— “Goodness! Mr. Carlton,—was it the bear?” “Oh! no—no—no! dear reader, it was the full disk of Domore's tow-linen posterior inexpressibles! For with proper regard of self-defence, and yet with this peculiar breach of etiquette, he was coming out of the aperture wrong end foremost! Aye-yah! you may hold up your fans, and so forth: but fans themselves would have joined in the universal, uncontrollable, ungenteel, and almost unendable laughter, that for the first and the last and the only time since its creation, startled and shook the grim old trees that day! Laughter like that occurs only once in a life time! And this is said deliberately, and to enable the judicious critics to remark— “The author on page so and so is again guilty of something like laughing at his own stories.” “Well,”—said Domore, when, at long last, he made his apology,—“well, I know'd it warnt the best manners to back out like; and it warnt powerful easy ither; but you see it a sort a couldn't be helped; for, says I to meself, down thare, 'spose, says I, the darn'd b'ar, or some sich ugly varmint, was to kim agin a feller, what would be the use of kickin at 'im? And so I jist sticked my torch in a hole, and drawed out my knife, and kim out as you see, and ready to give it to any varmint what mought kim ahind me.” This was voted satisfactory; and Domore was cheered as the lion of the New Purchase; showing, too, that the race of the Putnams is not extinct. Our pic-nicery was now ready; and we began to regale ourselves with keen appetites, when a few drops of water made us think some one was playing a prank; but alas! no—it was rain! downright rain. And now if I had the pen of a ready writer, I might tell how quick the eatables were deserted—knives, cups, plates, cloths, all stuffed and crammed into saddle-bags—shawls pitched on, and off, too—bonnets tied under chins—horses saddled—mounted —and we away, away, over Rock Ford—up and down Hickory Ridge—on Fire-Skin's trace—and once more snug and spongy behind Bill's cabin. Bill and his wife pressed us to stay all night,—a hunter's heart being always bigger than his cabin,—but we all refused except Domore: and he stayed, not to avoid the rain, but to talk over the cave affair and the bear scrape. We took a fresh start, and scampered on fast as ever to escape now the coming darkness: and in process of time reached Woodville, a sad reverse of the gay and dry party of the morning! Yet how we looked none could tell, for it was then a coal black night; but judging by our own plight, when standing by the kitchen fire, our whole party must have been a remarkably shivering and absorporific compound of mud and water! Upper class and aristocratic gowns, frocks, hats and broad cloth and silk in general, had encountered melancholy accidents; but none so serious as were met by two bran new second rate Leghorns, ambitiously sported for the first time to-day by two of our tip-top young ladies. These big-buggeries were not only soaked and stained with water and dirt of divers colors, but even torn by briars and branches: and this utter ruin and loss retarded our civilization a full year! it being all that time before the articles were replaced, and none others presuming to lead our fashions in this respect except the two pretty, but rather vain Misses Ladybook. CHAPTER LIV. “But ye that suffer; who have felt The destiny of earth, That death, with shadowy hand hath dealt Rebuke amid your mirth; To you this tribute of a word, When other sounds have fled, Will come like lov'd tones, faintly heard— The memory of the dead.” —Mellen. Our family was usually very harmonious: yet the surface of our quiescence was occasionally ruffled. For instance, Mr. Carlton believed that Miss Elizabeth Carlton, now nearly four years old, if she did spell, ought to do it by sounds of the letters: Aunt Kitty insisted it ought to be in the march of mind way—by pictures of things. And Aunt Kitty carried the day, affirming that the baby could learn to spell in six days!—Mr. Carlton not caring whether she spelled or not, provided she had plenty of air and sunshine, and played all the time with a kitten or a doll. But when he obstinately persisted that the little one could not ever learn to spell by pictures, and must do it by the sounds of separate letters, away flounced Aunt Kitty after a caricature book; and then flouncing back she said with a voice of triumph: “There, Mr. Carlton, spell her any where.” “Well, dearee, what does c-o-w spell?”—covering at the same time the figure with the hand. “Cow,” said the baby in an instant. “There! Mr. Carlton—now sir!”—dixit Aunt Kitty. “How do you know, dearee, that it spells cow?”—said Mr. C. “I sees the—legs!”—replied baby. Aunt Kitty put out; while echo maliciously repeated— “There! Mr. Carlton—now sir!” —Dear one! that was true learning Aunt Kitty gave you daily from the Word of God. She did, indeed, by her living voice, teach in figures about heaven! even as the blessed word itself. And it was to that heaven, dearest! you went not many months after; when death so strangely quenched the light of those sweetly soft blue eyes! Parents! have you children in heaven? The author hopes he has five. And shall we not strive to rejoin the loved ones, where day-dreams are no more; and all is glorious, satisfying, unending reality? CHAPTER LV. “There was a sound of revelry by night, And Belgium's capital had gathered then Her beauty and her chivalry; and bright The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men:— A thousand hearts beat happily; and when Music arose with its voluptuous swell, Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again, And all went merry as a marriage bell— But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell?” We shall conclude this year with a wedding. “Who is to be married?” John Glenville. “That old bachelor?” The same. “To whom?” Pardon me, I may not tell. The courtship, however, had been speedy. On his side an affair of the heart—not I fear, on hers. He certainly married not for money; she —but she is in her forest grave now—and let her memory, like her body, rot. Happy if another at the wedding had died—that one can never die so peaceful now! The serpents of our woods were fatal—yet they gave warning— thou wast and art a more deadly snake—and warned not! Traitor! the world will not understand this; and may deem it fiction—thou wilt understand and sooner or later— tremble! God save thee, however, the horrors of a death bed! The society of Woodville was not yet refined as it might have been; although steps for the sublimating process had been taken by our gentry, and with some success. Such attempts, however, by many, were regarded with jealousy, and by not a few with feelings of rancorous hostility. Sometimes, too, every attempt had failed, and that owing to the “galls:” for these insisted on mixing with our parties, and also on taking seats at table; or if not present, it was owning to management, and not a tame surrender of the helpers' rights. Not unfrequently had an embryo lady, or one emerging from the grub and hoosiery form, been compelled by the discontent of her help, who had detected the artifice of her mistress, to soothe the young lady by saying before the company: “Betty, child, I do wish you would sit down and a sort a pour out, while I run out and bake the rest of the cakes.” Once a very select party of prospective gentry had assembled at Mrs. Roughsmoothe's, and had become talkative and lively; when the gall-help, wishing to increase the fun, suddenly descended from the loft, into our company, and paraded over the room in her lady's husband's brother's old buckskin breeches! To aid the polishing of society, after long discussions among the ladies, not those only connected with the bride elect, but others intimate with our several families, it was determined to have a sample wedding. To this, indeed, the gentlemen all had objections; but the weaker sex, as is always in such affairs the case, proved the stronger: and so away to work went all hands for the grand display. And, now, the truth of political economy became manifest, that extravagance benefits mechanics, storekeepers, and the like; for we sold broadcloth, and trimmings, and silks, and satins—in short, all things for wedding-suits, dresses and decorations; and every mantua-maker, milliner, tailor, and shoemaker was in immediate requisition. Superfine flour, too, was needed—the best teas and coffees— the best loaf sugar—the best, in a word, of all persons and things from the beginning to the end of Woodville. Nay, many articles were required from the Ohio River. Hence, so many messages were sent, and so many packages brought, by waggoners and travellers, to and from, that long before the eventful day, half the State was advertised of the coming ceremony. Indeed, not a few at that time came into Woodville from adjoining counties: which accounts for the curious external celebration that accompanied the internal one. Nor were only selling and buying promoted by the affair— it increased borrowing and lending. Many, who “allowed” they would be asked, had agreed to lend one another suitable apparel, from caps and curls upwards, to shoes and stockings downwards: and our bride's folks, not having domestic means enough, had borrowed far and wide every article in the shape of china, proper and mock, and silver, German and real. Consequently, the whole settlement was more or less interested in our wedding: and it was clear as sunshine, we should have as fine a gathering of hoosiers, in all stages of refinement, both inside and outside the house, as the heart of man could desire. The wedding week had now arrived; and notes, prepared in the best style, were sent round by Wooley Ben, the negro barber, hired as waiter and to discharge a dozen other offices and duties. Additional waiters would have been employed; but this was the only respectable black “nigger” in town: and as to hiring a native, white, red, or brown, you might as easily have hired the Governor. Indeed, nobody had, either little enough brains, or sufficient temerity, to make the experiment:—a hundred to one, we should have either been jawed or, more likely, got our own jaws slapped. Well, the grand evening came at last; and about sun-down the wedding guests arrived, and were formally ushered into the parlour; which, for the first, saw ladies enter without bonnets, and with heads—some profusely, but many tastefully—decorated with flowers and curls, artificial and real. And never had that room been so full of seats, varying from sofa to stool, or of so many yards of silk, thread-lace, and bobinette! It had the honour of sustaining the first fashionable jam ever known in the Purchase! Across the entry, was a dining room; which was now devoted to the supper-table, and its fixins. The supper differed, however, in no important point from an eastern affair—except, it was twice as abundant. But our furniture was very different. Things went, indeed, by usual names; yet the plate and the plates were very unlike modern articles: and they were different from themselves! All were antique vases, goblets, spoons, and so forth, the relics of broken and by-gone sets; and gathered, not merely from all parts of the Union, but from France, England, Nova-Scotia, Scotland, and Wales. China and silver representatives were on that table, of all the grand old-fashioned dignity once pertaining to the ancestry of the Woodville grandees; and whose pretensions to gentility thus shone forth in a dumb show! Not a bit of plate, pretended or genuine, but what had been borrowed, and several pieces had even been sent voluntarily; so that Ned, one of the company without, very properly said, in his vernacular: “Well! bust my rifle, if I allowed thare was sich a powerful heap of silver and chanery in these here diggins! I tell you what, Domore! wouldn't them wot-you-callums buy up ne'er about all Uncle Sam's land in these parts?” It has been said, the incipient attempts to sublimate and crystalize society, were viewed by many with enmity: and hence the male clarifiers had opposed any grand doings now, as the whole might irritate, excite great prejudice, and even retard the desired improvements. That such fears were not groundless, will appear in the sequel: but an episode is here necessary. In many places of the Far West, in those days, was prevalent a custom derived from the Canadians, called Chevrarai; or, as pronounced by us in the Purchase, and spelled by Mr. Nonpareil Primer, our College printer— Shíver-ree. And that looks and sounds as much like the thing as its echo. Hence we shall follow nature, or Mr. Primer, (who was very natural in spelling,) and call the thing Shíver-ree. The Shíver-reeing was done by a collection of all physical bodies capable of emitting sounds from a sugar kettle to a horse-shoe; and from the hoarsest bass of the toughest hoosier, to the most acute treble of the tenderest hoosierine—and all, at a signal, let off at once under the windows, and in the very doors, of the marriage house. Commonly fun only was designed; and the serenaders good humouredly retired after a dram of some alcoholic liquor. Still, a little frolicsome mischief was sometimes added. For instance, the Shíver-ree-ers would insist on seeing the bridegroom; and the moment he appeared, he would be transported to their shoulders, and paraded round a few hundred yards, and in the very centre of the music; after which, he would be restored to his anxious bride, and Vol. II.—11 the revellers, giving three cheers, would retire. The bridegroom would, indeed, sometimes be kept too long; as was the case with the young store-keeper, who had been of our cave party: for, the Shíver-ree folks, having, by a very cunning stratagem, caught this bridegroom, contrived to carry him away, and keep him locked up in the jury-room of the Court-house till near day-break, when he was liberated! And, all this, without his being able to identify one of his persecutors! But the Shíver-ree was used, also, to annoy any unpopular person or family. And, then, not even double or quadruple drams could purchase peace. The moment always chosen to begin the concert, was when the parties stood before the parson. Then the power of his voice, the patience of the groom, and the nerves of the bride, were all fairly tested. The solemnization was as publicly, and loudly announced as by the roar of artillery at royal celebrations. The art within was to elude the vigilance of the party without: in which attempt, however, to the best of my recollection, the party within was always preeminently unsuccessful—it being not possible that any movement could escape a dozen practised eyes and ears watching for signs, and usually aided by treachery within the house. Well, to-night, with all experience against us, and although notified, by ominous sounds of rehearsal, that the musicians were ready, we tried the usual ways of eluding —such as dropping the curtains, appointing sentinels for doors and crevices, and specially by keeping up no small noise ourselves, laughing, talking, and screaming, up to the instant when Mr. Clarence suddenly rose and met the bridal party, entering from an adjoining apartment. Without delay, he began with the notice, that, by virtue of a license in his hand, he appeared to unite in marriage the parties named therein, viz.—John Glenville, of Guzzleton, and Evelina B—, of B—: and, as the profoundest stillness yet prevailed without, we began to exchange smiles of triumph, that, for once, Argus had been beguiled. Even the preacher proceeded, with unwonted confidence, and said, pro formulâ—“if any one present knows reason why the parties ought not to be united in the bands of wedlock, let such an one now speak —.” If any body inside answered, the voice was unheard in the horrid din from without, that interrupted and replied to the Reverend Gentleman's inquisitorial formula. What the din resembled, the reader, if poetic and fond of music, may imagine, when we run over the instruments of that extra-transcendental quavering, quivering, shivering and roaring uproar!—viz. two corn baskets full of cow-bells tied to saplings;—a score and a half of frying pans beat with mush sticks;—two and thirty Dutch oven and skillet lids clashed as cymbals;—fifty-three horse shoes, played as triangles;—ten large wash-tubs and seven small barrels drummed with fists and corn-cobs;—one hundred and ninety-five quills, prepared and blown as clarionets;— forty-three tin-whistles and baby-trumpets, blown till they all cracked;—two small and one large military drums with six fifes, blown on D in alt., or thereabouts;—add imitations of scalp and war cries;—and inhuman yells, screams, shrieks and hisses, of the most eminent vocalists! The human performers were estimated from two hundred and fifty to three hundred and fifty! there being about two hundred extra volunteers from other counties:—the whole mammoth-rabble-rouse being got up to do special dishonour to “d—d 'ristocraticul and powerful grand big-bug doins!” There were also super-human vocalists!--of these directly. Temperance had advocates ready to shoot, but not be shot for her, in our party; hence when the ceremony was supposed to be ended, by the parson's being seen kissing the wife, out started the two groomsmen and several volunteers with buckets, pitchers, and cups, to molify the drinking part of the serenaders. But when the customary doses were administered, not only did the musicians not retire with the complimentary cheers, but remained and calling for “big-bug wine—fit for gentlemen!” and letting off at each repetition of the demand peals of shíver-ree; till finding after all no wine forthcoming, they manifested symptoms of more serious riot and abuse. This awakened an angry spirit in the bridal party, and threats from without were answered by menace from within, while inquiries were made of our host what arms could be furnished for the defence of the castle. At this instant a window sash behind the Miss Ladybooks was cautiously raised from without, and before I could step thither to hold down the sash, in leaped a musician—a four footed swine, some six months of age, and weighing some fifty pounds! Master Grunter had evidently entered unwillingly: and although in his descent he availed himself of one lady's shoulder, and another's lap, he trod elastically as an essenced exquisite, and scarcely deranged a collar or soiled a frock! The feat was cheered by piggy's associates; and the more, as our ladies in avoiding the unclean gentleman, had sprung upon chairs, sofas, and even tables, where their alarmed countenances were visible above the curtains to the bipedalic hogs without. Young Squeal, however, behaved himself just like a pig in a parlour—he sneaked with a tight-twisted tail and a vulgar grunt under the grand bridal sofa: and thence, I forget how, he was unceremoniously turned out among his former friends, where he felt himself more at home. Virginia and Kentucky blood was now approaching the boiling point; and a rush was made by some of us towards the door—but there Dr. Sylvan had, with great wisdom, already taken post to prevent if possible, either ingress or egress. Still the door could not be kept wholly closed; and we thus caught glimpses of performers mounted on the backs of performers—the super-human ones being large four-footed hogs, which were held on human backs, by their front legs, advanced hugging fashion, each side a human neck! As the rational creatures capered up and down with their riders, those irrational ones, in terror and fierce indignation, were sending forth those long, woful, keen, nerve-shaking appeals for release, that we in simplicity had till now imagined masterly imitations of some squeaking even better than piggy himself! Nothing like the true hog after all! Meanwhile, two thus doing piggy-back in reverse order, had gradually advanced to the door; when the horse-pig essayed to force a wider aperture, intending to incline forward and thus allow the mounted animal to leap into the entry, and thence into the dining room to upset and demolish the table with its goodies and silver. But no sooner had the hog-ridden serenader thrust his hand into the aperture than Dr. S. aided by Harwood, forced the door against the member, and so held the gentleman that he cried out not wholly unlike Mr. Snout but a moment before on his back, yet now let fall! It is wonderful how hard a fellow can pull when his hand is thus caught! Why, spite of all the force against him, he did jerk his hand out—and left nothing behind except the skin of a thumb with a nail attached!—a scalp for the victors! At the instant word came to the author, that his darling little girl had gone into fits from fright! And when I beheld the blood gushing from her nose, and her face pale and death-like—* * *—yes, I rushed out bare-headed and weaponless, followed by a few bold friends with lights, Dr. S. having left the door to attend to the babe! Our design was to catch some in the act of riot, and make them answer at a legal tribunal. Aware of this, the rabble fled as our lights advanced: but soon rallying in a dark corner, they began to salute us with groans, hisses and stones--and then rose the cry, “Knock 'em down!—drag the big-bug yankees through the creek!” And so our situation was momentarily becoming more and more critical, when a well-known voice thus arose in our behalf:— “Bust my rifle!—if I'm goin to stand by and see that ither, I say, or my name's not Ned Stanley—no! no! I tell'd you to put off a hour ago, when me and Domore kim up, arter they give us the fust dram. Them folks ain't to my idee, no how, but they've got rites as well as the best on us—and I ain't agoin for to see 'em trampled on no furthur no how. I say Bob Carltin's a powerful clever feller, arter all, albeit he's thick with big-bugs—and, bust my rifle, if any man knocks him down to-night, or drags him in the water, till he tries hisself fust on Ned Stanley!” “Them's my idees, Ned,”—responded the well known voice of Domore,—“and it tain't us Woodill fellers no how, what's carried it so fur—its them darn'd blasted chaps from the Licks and Nobs. And I'm not goin ither to go agin a man what was with us in Bill's cave—and if that leetle gal a hissin is gone in a fit, I'm most powerful teetotal sorry I had any thing to do with the fun any how. Come, come, darn my leggins, let's make ourselves skerse —come, fellers, let's be off!” Mobs, like other flocks and herds, follow their leaders by instinct. After all Virgil's poetical great man's power to smoothe down popular swells, this night showed he could have done nothing that way in the Purchase[41] [41] Unless he had a cart whip like a priest—and drove tame jackasses —ours were wild ones. For though the grave and reverend Clarence was with us, no subsidence in the boiling sea was visible, till Ned and Domore rose in their majesty; and while two or more schoolmasters were abroad in the land that night, the quelling of riot and preventing of violence and bloodshed, was by radical leaders destitute of learning and gravity, but full of courage, manly feeling and muscular power! Man may be known from books, but men and boys are different matters; and the phases of the genus Homo in the Purchase were then different from the phases elsewhere. Even a genuine Hoosier mob is totally unlike a scum mob in an Atlantic city: generosity may be found in the former, none in the latter. The first loves rather the fun, the latter, the plunder and blood, of a riot. Fear of the military scatters the city mob, an appeal to manliness disperses the Hoosier one. Our retreat was left, of course, unimpeded; nor was the annoyance renewed. Yet the spirit of frolic was up; and aided by the spirit of the still. Hence, away rolled the tumult to the forest; where the prowling panther and other denizens of the lairs, were appalled by a tempest of sounds, such as never before had disturbed the solemnities of the grand old shades. And the orgies of the drunken-god were celebrated as in primitive times, when Orpheus was hired to lead home the raving wives and daughters of his townsmen. Next day, Dr. Sylvan and others dreading future results of the Shíver-ree made inquisition for leading rioters. None, of course, could be identified, save the man without the thumb-skin; and he, taking the alarm, became “so skerse” as never again to be seen in Woodville. For a while, therefore, the Shíver-ree was disused; but by degrees it was again introduced, and when we left the Purchase it was there as popular and noisy as ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIXTH YEAR. CHAPTER LVI. “Mar. Alas my lord I have but killed a Fly! Tit. But how, if that fly had a father and mother? How would he hang his slender gilded wings, And buzz lamenting doings in the air? Poor harmless fly! That with his pretty buzzing melody, Came here to make us merry—And thou hast killed him!” By a recent charter of our college, it was appointed that the Faculty should oversee the Students; the Trustees, oversee the Faculty; the Board of Visitors, the Trustees; and the Legislature the Visitors;—the people in general engaging to oversee the Legislature, and the people of Woodville, the entire whole! The cause of education was, then, well overseen! And yet our circle was as vicious as that of the Church Militant and Insultant; which keeps its antagonist foundations in perpetual somerset—top and bottom being always at bottom and top—and yet so circumferential as to be alike destitute of top or bottom, or bottom or top—and bound by its infallibility to roll on for ever in its absurdities! And now was to be found the rara avis—the white crow —a good President. Distant and learned gentlemen had answered our first inquiries, by an earnest recommendation of Mr. Clarence; but so widely did that personage differ in opinion, that he suppressed a letter written to himself urging him by all means to be a candidate. He plead his youth; and his wish to remain in a subordinate post to perfect himself in his favourite studies,—languages, history, and mathematics. He insisted, also that good professors were as important as a good president; and with a little allowable vanity, he added, if he should make so good a president, as his friends' partiality led them to suppose, it would be quite a loss to deprive the college of so good a professor! He, therefore, did,—(unwisely as Mr. Carlton thinks)—decline a nomination, and earnestly entreat the Board to look out for “an older man!” Professor Harwood then suggested the Reverend Constant Bloduplex, D. D., of Wheelabout; and a committee was appointed to open a correspondence with that gentleman. But as his reply was not received till after my return from collecting certain debts, &amp;c., we shall for the present, take our reader on an excursion. Fortunately, for the last forty-eight hours were collecting reverend gentlemen at Woodville to form a travelling party towards the south to a famous council, of which Clarence was also a member; and I was furnished with the most agreeable associates. Regalists may sneer at dissenting and republican clergy; but I repeat, what can never be repeated too often, that such clergy, when evangelical and intelligent, aside from a spice of sectarianism— (and a man without a spice is no man, but a sneaking time-server)—are the most benevolent, instructive, entertaining, cheerful, and liberal of men. They condense and concentrate most qualities, too, essential to good fellowship. Ay! they are usually men of the greatest courage. And when and where duty calls, whether into jeopardy of property, or character, or ease, or limb, or life itself, no men more fearlessly or resolutely encounter it. A good man fears God—and that absorbs or counteracts all other fears. Exceptions occur; yet of intelligent and learned folks the true clergy can and do, most easily and naturally, accommodate themselves to opposite lives; and, not to acquire fame or money or power, or do penance—but to do good. Influence is, indeed, thus acquired, yet not more 11* than is right and desirable. Far from my beloved land be that hour, when her own republican ministers shall have no literary, moral and spiritual influence! God shield her from the Egyptian darkness threatening from yonder ominous cloud rising above the distant horizon—shaped not like a man's hand, and pregnant with refreshing rains, but like a man's toe portending contempt, spurning, overthrow and subjugation. But I smell faggots!—and I court not martyrdom—and none can tell what Hugheous attempts may next be made nor when! Sneer on! antipuritan! if you fear not for us, it is high time, as Cato told Cæsar in the Roman Senate, we should fear for ourselves! Bow your own base neck—we will never bow ours! Our party was increased at every ferry and cross path till it numbered twenty-two; enough to hold meeting on horseback. The time was mid Spring; and the old woods were glorying in the sylvan splendours of new dresses and decorations. The sun was, indeed, ardent, and rejoicing like one to run a race; but then the dense foliage spread a screen over the pathway, while the balmy breath of zephyrs, rich with perfume of wild flower and blossom, fanned our faces and sported with the forest leaf and spray. Beauteous birds and tribes of unseen animals and insects from every branch, and every bushy lair or cavern, were pouring forth choral symphonies of praise. Was it wonderful, then, that Christians going to a spiritual congress, should be unable to restrain hymns of praise? Out upon rationalism, or any pseudo-ism that makes men dumb like—like—“beasts?” No; “insects?” No;— these in the woods God planted and nurtured for ages are vocal. “Like what then?” Like a German or a French Atheist. Hymns then, as we rode, were sung; and, with heart and voice, in the solemn and joyous words of king David. God was felt to be there! His grand temple was around us! How like sons and daughters going home rejoicing! How like the Church in the wilderness! We have before said, what in religion begins in poetry often ends in prose; —and so would be the result now, if fanaticism should get up a system of protracted and locomotive meetings on horse-back! The poetry belongs only to the accidental occurrence. Arrived in due time at the place of the council, I was induced to remain a day and witness its proceedings. The weather being favourable, and no cabin being large enough to accommodate the hundreds of spectators, many of whom had come more than a hundred miles, it was arranged to hold the sessions in the woods. Among the accommodations was a large wagon body placed on suitable timbers, to serve for a pulpit; and here, during the religious exercises, were seated all the clerical members—making with their aggregate weight a half a ton of theologians, if not of divinity. Here, also, during the secular business, was seated the President, —and supported by his scribes on the right and left. But I was soon hurried from this Nice council, by the stress of worldly business; and that accomplished, it was necessary for me to return alone to Woodville, and by a route then very rarely taken by any person, and never before nor since by myself. On my first day, I was fortunately overtaken by a large company, unlike my religious friends, and yet by no means unacceptable comrades in the vast wilderness I had just entered. It was a Surveyor and his assistants, going to run some line, or lay out some road. In genuine Western style they welcomed me not only to ride with them, but to participate their dough-biscuits and jerked venison. We beguiled the way, of course, with anecdote and story of adventures and mishaps till tired of telling and hearing; and then, recreation came on wings, in the shape of horse-flies! The tame or civilized horse-fly of the Atlantic States, is well enough as to size; and, when half starved, can bite reasonably well;—but the ill-bred, barbarian horse-fly, or rather flies, for the sorts are countless,—can't they bite! Like all hoosiery and woolverine things, they are regardless of dignities; and hence suck blood from the rider as well as the horse! They even make no distinction between merchants[42] [42] Perhaps they regard such as shop-keepers. and men! or between the “brethren” and “the misters!!” Very probably they would suck blood from the President of the United States!—the greatest of all earthly potentates—(in breeches, of course!) Ay! from Uncle Sam, and Brother Jonathan:—although their blood so much excels that of the Russian Bear, or John Bull! Nothing like the Great-Grand-North-American-Re-publican Horse-Fly!† † Except the Great-Grand Humbugs, and other buzzing fooleries, of our country. —ten of them can kill a dandy! Now, a man can endure a single fly: but a cloud pitching at once on him and his horse, requires some patience and no small activity and diligence. The best antidote is a duck's bill. This, however, is inconvenient to administer, as it requires a cessation of motion and a recumbent posture. Indeed, to be fully benefitted, one must lie down, as we saw a cow to-day at a squatter's cabin, and permit, as she did, six active ducks and one drake, to traverse the whole body, and gobble up and down the flies at the instant of alighting, and make repeated successful snaps at them on the wing! The best defensive armour would doubtless be to have one's whole skin tanned—(leatherwise):—and next, are boots and leggins, as far as they go: but summer coat and inexpressibles are as good as—nothing. Some advantage is found by inserting tops of broken bushes into every crevice of the horse-trappings; into the hat-band and button holes; and at the tops of boots and leggins: yet, with all these, will be lots of work both for the man's hands and the horse's tail. I do wish Mrs. Trollope had been with us to-day. If she had seen nothing to amuse and interest her, I am certain we should—although we had enough as it was. To a student of nature, how interesting our appearance—all bestuck with bushes—a grove on horse-back! whence issued human hands slapping hard, as a Catholic self-inflicting penance! Then the madness of a bushman missing a fly! and his triumph and malicious joy in mashing one! The horses, now stopping with one side to stamp and bite! now springing away, to rub off the torment in the bushes! and then their tails!—it did seem they would, sooner or later, switch and swing loose, and fall off! The grand exhibition, however, was by a poor brute of a horse, with a short tail and a tipsy rider. As to the tail, that had been partly amputated by some barbarian—(there being a fashion in horse-tails as in whiskers)—and, added to that inhumanity, was the inconsiderate behaviour of a silly colt, into whose mouth the tail-stump had fallen—the hair being all eaten away by the said colt, till the denuded thing stuck out six inches only, like a wooden article of the same name, glued to a toy-horse, to show which end is not the head. Think!—to be with such a make-believe tail, in a flock of horse-flies! And the drunken rider had arranged no grove of bush-tops!! Had the flies infested the human beast! but these sagacious flocks knew what was for their health, and, therefore, stuck to the horse; thus causing the animal to endure a thousand fold for the sin of his master. In vain, then, did he wag that stump of a naked tail! in vain halt to stamp, bite, and kick! in vain vibrate his hide and the tip of the ears, till he seemed all over like a church full of moving fans!— there stuck the flies! At every halt, the rider kicked and basted; but never moved the horse away till convinced halting, and biting, and kicking could not dislodge his foes, and then he moved to be sure—but not ahead. He did it sideways, till he reached some tree or bush, along which he rubbed, crushing and sweeping off the flies; and often, very much to our inward delight, barking the skin from his vile master's legs! At last, the flies, understanding the brevity of the tail, and the defenceless state of the nag, attacked his quarters, head and rear, covering, but not protecting, his entire flanks! What could he do? He reiterated his stamp— bite—vibration; he sidled against trees, rubbing and kicking; and then, under the combined attacks of whip, heels and flies, seizing the bit between his teeth, he, on a sudden, darted away as if borne on wings himself! Pencil of Hogarth! paint that sight! Set forth the trembling spicebushes divided, broken, crushed, by a tornado borne on horse-heels! Draw that nag emerging, ever and anon, from thickets of thorn and briar!—a human leg, despoiled of leggin, rising horizontal, this side now, now that, and instinctively, like the scales of justice, keeping the equilibrium of a body recumbent, with head nodding and jerking, amid the dishevelled and raggy mane of a horse-neck!— hands therein clenched! Depict the flocks of surviving flies hanging over in the air, and waiting for the race to end! And, oh! last, yet not least, though so very little, do that tail! It had played its part before; now it was worked with more than one-horse power! It spun round as on a patent gudgeon! It multiplied itself—now, a dozen tails—now, no tail at all!—nothing appearing, save a white circumference, a streak made by the bone where the article had been amputated! Its motion was no longer to switch away flies; it was instinctive, and to steer by: yet whether it failed as a helm, or steered as was designed, on our galloping up, there was the fly-bitten pony, wallowing pig-like in a delicious stream of spring water; and the rider wading out about ankle deep, and dripping! And so ends about the tail. The tender-hearted will rejoice to know, however, that upon this poetical justice administered by the horse, the master, now a cold-water man and sobered, kept a whole wilderness of bushes about both; and, that he abstained, that day at least, from his whiskey bottle—partly, I believe though, because it was broken in the fall. Shortly after this, I left the Surveyor's company, and, pursuing a solitary trace, reached, late in the evening, my lodging place; where I learned I had yet forty miles to travel to reach Woodville. “Stranjer,”—said my host—“it's a most powerful woody country, and without no road, nor even blind trace worth naming—it being, a sort a kiver'd with ole leaves; and thar's no cabin nearer nor King's—and that's more nor 15 miles. Howse'er, I'll set you over the river afore sun-up— and if you don't miss the trace, then you kin git to King's for breakfust.” Almost devoured by flies, and then frightfully flea-bitten in bed, my dreams were naturally fantastic; and I had visions of howling wildernesses, tangled thickets, prowling panthers, and great swollen fiery serpents. Woodsmen, also, I knew had been lost in that unsettled region; and even last summer two persons had wandered about three days. Yet, I longed to be on my journey, and to know the worst; and, with a hope my case would be different. Beside, I had a secret ambition to appear well as a woodsman in Domore's and Ned's eyes; and I was aware Sylvan would even think better of me, if I crossed such a wilderness alone. It was something of a task with such men. Accordingly, by early dawn, I was ferried over, the river, and sat in my saddle, while my host, standing in his scow and ready to pole back, thus issued his final directions: “Ride strate up-bank whare you be—then keep spang a-head, across the bottim, without no turn at all, and, in a short quarter, you'll strike the d'sarted cabin. It's burnt now—but the logs are some on 'em a-layin' in a heap— that's whare the poor squatter was murdered and skulp'd in the war time, by the Injins. Well—arter you git thare, ride round to the west ind of the ole clerein, and you'll find the trace, sich as it is, if it ain't kivered—and, if you get once fair on it—I sort a think you'll go safe enough to King's.” That said, good byes were shouted; while the scow swung from the shore, and my noble creature ascended the bank; and we began to go a-head for the burnt cabin. Some declination was, indeed, necessary to get round unleapable logs, impassable thickets, and the like; yet, prior to such deviations, having placed myself in a line with several objects before and behind, I easily regained my course, and, in a short time, came to the cabin ruins. Here we paused an instant, to contemplate the scene—so like what I had pictured in reading border tales! But, haste and anxiety allowed only short delay, and I rode quickly round to the west of the clearing; where, after a narrow search along the edge of the forest I discerned the only semblance of a trace; and, into this, dashing with trembling confidence, I was soon hid in the shades of a true wilderness. However romantic such a wild may be in print, my thoughts in the wilderness itself, were all concentrated on one object—the path. And long what seemed the path, dim always and sometimes obliterated, as it led far away into the gloom of impervious shades, now turning almost back to skirt an impassable thicket, now tumbling almost perpendicularly into a deep ravine, and now scaling its opposite side, then mounting a ridge, then circling a pond o dark and dangerous looking water, and then vanishing for a few moments as of necessity it passed through patches of weeds and briars—long time this trace occupied all my meditations and excited my intensest watchings and kept me asking in a mental and often an audible voice—“I do wonder, if this is the way?” To which, as nobody else replied, I would answer myself—“Well, I guess it must be —if this is not, I'm sure I don't see any other!” And then, as though poor Kate shared my anxiety, would I say “Come! Kate!—cheer up, you shall soon have your breakfast—let's hurry on to King's!” When gaily tossing her fine head, and shaking her flowing mane, she would with her hoofs redouble the echoes; and away, away, with thrilling hearts, we ever bounded onward and onward and farther and farther into the solemn grandeur of those primitive wilds! In some two hours the trace, owing to the nature of the ground, became better defined and less interrupted; hence, waxing confident we indulged in a colloquy, self-congratulatory and maybe self-laudatory, thus: “Well, we're safe after all, Kate, I do believe!—wonder what Ned will say?—hey?” To this Kate switched an answer with her magnificent tail, and evinced increased eagerness to be going ahead; and so with a real “hurraw' my noble Kate?—hurraw!” on my part, and an additional snort on hers, we were streaking on at the rate now of seven miles to the hour! And then, in about four hours from the burnt cabin, we caught sight of King's cabin, crowning a mound on the far side of a small stream. Advancing to bespeak refreshments, I was met at the door by a portly lady, who proved to be that King's wife; and though no queen, was large enough for two queen patterns of the Victoria-Albert size. “Is this Mr. King's, ma'am?” “Well, I allow so; but my ole man's from home—he's went to a rasin two miles off—” “You keep public, don't you, Ma'am?” “Well, I allow so; but King's tuk the bakun with him to the rasin—” “Ay?—can't I get something for my nag?” “Well, I allow so; jist go round to yan crib, and git what cawn you like.” This done, and Kate left to enjoy as much corn as was wholesome, I entered the cabin and our conversation was renewed. “Well, but Mrs. King, ain't you got nothing at all a hungry fellow can eat?” “Stranjur—I'm powerful sorry—but we're teetotally out —he tuk every bit of food with him—” “What's that—up there?” “Law, bless you, stranjur! that's a piece of most powerful rusty flitch—tain't fit for a dog to eat—” “Oh! ma'am, let's have it—why I can eat your dog himself—I'm so hungry.” “He! ha!—well you ain't proud like the Fakilty big-bugs across thar at Wood'ill, that's sarten. How I do wish King hadn't a tuk the food! But you ain't in arnest about the yaller flitch are you?” “To be sure!—clap on your skillet, Mrs. King!” “Well—I do sentimentally wish it was better like. Let's see, here's a handful of meal in the bag arter all—and I'd a got it afore, only I allowed you was proud like. But I see you're none of that 'are sort—'spose I do the meal?” “Thank you, ma'am! I know you would give me the best if Mr. King hadn't gone to the raising.” The skillet was soon hot; and then received as many slices as could lie in comfort on the bottom. The colour of the dainty had been originally amber, the fat being then semi-transparent, as it was mast fed, i. e. fed on acorns and beech nuts. Time, however, fatal to beauty, had incrusted the flitch with an oxide of wonderful thickness and peculiar dirt colour, and turned its lovely amber transparency into a decided and opaque yellow. Something of the kind I had often seen in cot-days; when, on being importunate for buckwheat cakes in the kitchen, Betty often threatened my face with “the griddle-greaser!” Mrs. King had shaken her bag into a large wooden bowl; and the deposit was, one pint of second chop meal, minus half a gill something else, and a few horse hairs; for, bags in attending mill are used as saddles, and pommelled between inexpressibles and perspiring horsebacks. Water then was poured into the compound; and the lady after handling the mixture without gloves, produced a handful of good chicken-feed. Then the hissing flitch being hastily turned into a pewter plate with a damaged circumference, the feed was splashed in, like mortar into chinking, to be converted into corn bread. This transmigration over, the bread was associated with the flitch on the cloudy pewter, Mrs. King remarking that, “her man had tuk the crokry to the rasin;” and then, after wiping each thumb on her woollen petticoat, she invited me with the formula, “Well —come! set up.” I was soon seated on my rickety stool at the board, or rather boards, (as the table was of two such and a piece,) and began to flourish my blade,—the knife belonging to that irascible class that had flown off the handle,—and, also, I began to look for its partner, the fork. But that had flown off with the handle, for, said she—“He tuk all thar knives and forks but this poor bit of a thing, and that was left 'cos it had no handle!”—“but, Stranjur,” continued she, “jeest lend me that a minit, and I'll git you a fork.” Out, then, darted Mrs. King; and soon returned manufacturing as she came a fork, and saying thus: “Thar, stranjur, this 'ere I split off a rail, and cut down a sort a so to a pint, 'ill do for a fork better nor your fingers—albeit, I'm powerful sorry for our poor fixins.” “Thank you, ma'am! all the same—you've a kind heart; and that's meat and drink in this world of ours, sometimes.” Yet these and other speeches were continually interrupted by the rapid ingress of lumps of flitch and balls of bread. I regret to record, however, that while I used my fork to pin down the fat till its reduction to mouthfuls, I was compelled to eat, like a democrat, with my knife! I made, indeed, some amends to a violated good-breeding, by sopping my gravy with bread in my left hand,—like a gentleman eating fish and other things, with a leaky silver fork. Singular! how the extremes of refinement and hoosierism do meet! Dialogue Continued. “Well, I'm powerful rite down glad you kin eat sich like food! what mought your name be—if it's no offence!” “Carlton, ma'am, I live in Woodville—” “Well—that's what I suspish'nd. Ned Stanley was out here last winter a huntin, and I heerd him tell on you— as how you was a powerful clever feller—albeit a leetle of a big-bug. But I'll take your part arter this—and King shill too.” “Oh! Mrs. King if we were all better acquainted with one another, we'd all think better of our friends and neighbours. But I must be off—what's the damage?” “Bless me! Mr. Carltin, I don't take nuthin for sich a meal! Put up that puss, if you want to be friends—I'm powerful sorry King's away—call here next time, sir, and I allow, you'll git somethin good enough for a white man.” “Thank you! Mrs. King, thank you. Well—please give me directions—I'm not much of a woodsman.” “Well, you're comin on. Howsever you've kim the wust ind of the trace, and wont find no diffikilty till about fifteen miles on at the next settlement, Ike Chuff's—where you mought foller a cow path—and so you'd better stop thar and axe.” In due time, and after a hard ride of thirty miles from the burnt cabin, we came in sight of Ike Chuffs clearing. As the trace ran plain and broad round the fence and across a small ravine, I was unwilling to waste time with needless inquiries, and, therefore, followed the line of path with undiminished confidence. The trace, indeed, narrowed—it once or twice vanished —all that was no novelty; but at last we seemed to reach the vanishing point, for now, after the last vanish, the path never re-appeared! In place of the one, however, were seen four! and those running in as many different directions and evidently, like Gay's road—to no places at all! And so, for the neglect of inquiring, Kate and I had been judiciously following a cow-path! “Why not steer by the sun?” That is easy enough, my friend, in a country where there is a sun. I had, indeed, seen little of that “Great Shine” all day; and for the last two hours nothing, a rain having then commenced which lasted till our reaching Woodville. “What did you do then?” Trusted to Kate to find the way back to Chuff's;—as we had hardly gone two miles astray—and that she did in fifteen minutes. “What then?” You shall hear for yourself—“Hilloo! the house!” “Well—hilloo! what's wantin!” “The trace to Woodville—I missed it just now.” “Sorter allowed so, when I seed you take the cow-path to the licks— “Well, my friend, why didn't you hollow to me?” “'Cos I allowed you mought a ax'd if you ain't a wood a man—and if you be, you know'd the way to the licks as well as me.” “Thank you, sir; will you show me now?” “Take the path tother ind of the fence.” Neighbour Chuff's settlement differs, you see, in suavity from King's. Still, the Hoosier's direction was right; and with nothing more romantic than our feed in the morning, we arrived pretty much used up to a late dinner in the evening at Woodville—having done more than forty wilderness miles in about twelve hours! For the whole, however, I was rewarded, when Dr. Sylvan that night called at our house and said with an approving smile: “Pretty well done! pretty well done! After this I think we may dubb you a backwoodsman.” CHAPTER LVII. “Ha! ha! ha! D'ye think I did not know you, Hal?” Dr. Sylvan's visit was to announce the favourable reply of Dr. Bloduplex to the letter of the committee. But the people were in a new tumult; and a petition to the next Assembly was circulating for signatures, praying that the Trustees be ordered to expel either Clarence or Harwood, or both; and that while Bloduplex should be elected as President, the professors should be taken each out of different sects. For, reader, the two existing members of the Faculty were both Rats; and Dr. Bloduplex was of the same denomination! This, however, was then[43] [43] Learning and talents now are not necessary in teachers; for there are many first-rate teachers without. Owing to the iproved era. the natural result of circumstances—that sect being twenty-five years since pre-eminent in learning, talent and enterprise. And this I am bound as a true historian to declare, although Dr. Bloduplex and myself do not belong to the same sect! —an impartiality to be remembered to my credit hereafter. I perceive we have thoughtlessly given a clue to the sect meant. For when it is found by the reader what sect twenty-five years ago, was pre-eminent in the respects named, my secret so nicely kept is out—he has discovered the Rats! But if such sect cannot be found, then among the fictitious things of this book will, I fear, be placed our worthy President, the Rev. Constant Bloduplex. In this emergency, it occurred, that another petition in aid apparently of the other, and yet subversive, by reducing its principles to an absurdity, should be sent to the Legislature, as the proper way for “Hoosier to fight Hoosier.” Something must be done, because our magnates at the Capitol would certainly essay something disastrous to the college. Hence, the suggestion meeting Dr. Sylvan's approbation, the framing of said petition was committed to Mr. Carlton; when in a few days the following able paper —(hem)—was submitted, corrected, approved, and adopted by our friends: “To the Honorable the Representatives of — in General Assembly convened at Timberopolis, this petition of the People of Woodville and the New Purchase generally, is respectfully submitted:— “First, that the existing Faculty of our College be requested to resign before the election of a President, that all denominations may have a fair and equal chance for places: “Secondly, that, there being nine religious sects in our state, and three of philosophers, viz:—the Deistical, the Atheistical, and the Fanny-wright-dale-owen-istical,—three members of Faculty be annually elected out of each and every of these twelve sects and bodies—each set of three to serve one month, till the year ends, and then to recommence with other sets of three, and so on till the end of time. “Among many unanswerable reasons for this petition, we urge only four:— “1. It is the true Anti-federal Democratical and Pure Republican course, founded on rotation; for it is useless to assert that all have a right to become Professors, unless it can be shown possible and practicable: “2. It will promote learning: for, when manifest that every body, in turn, can be Professor, every body will go to studying to get enough to last him at least a month: “3. It is said, confidently, by some sectarian leaders, that if they were in, their sects would each send one hundred students to College! Hence, all sects doing the same—as all will when one does—our College flourishes at once with twelve hundred students!! “4. The amazing cheapness of the plan. It will cost nothing, except travelling expenses! Your petitioners have been repeatedly informed, that no Democratical Republican and patriotic Citizen will charge a dollar for his one month's professional services!—but that all will serve for the honour! and hence our Transmontane Commonwealth shall show to the Whole Admiring World, the noble sight of the Greatest, Most Wonderful, Most Powerful Free School System in the Universe!!!! “This petition, and reasons, are respectfully submitted, and your petitioners—all, at least, that acknowledge a Supreme Being—will ever pray,” &amp;c. This petition was copied by James Sylvan, the Doctor's nephew; who, being a talented young man, the paper was generally attributed to him. When circulated, it soon had the proper number of signatures—a few signing with a full understanding of its nature, and not a few believing it auxiliary to the other, and already signed by them! These latter thought, if one petition would do good, two would do more. Sorry am I to say, both Ned and Domore signed both papers! Yet, afterwards, Ned insisted, with the most awful “busts of his rifle!” that he had signed the first only to please his neighbours! and then ours, to counteract the other's evil tendency!! Ned had a little of the Falstaff in him—and Shakspeare drew from life. Well, the petition was forwarded about Christmas: and a waggish member, who affected to be a very Adams in defence of the right of petition, contrived to present our paper before the appearance of its enemy. And the effect, they say, was such on the risibles of our “grave and reverend seigniors,” that Insidias Cutswell, Esq., who had charge of the other paper, did himself join heartily in the laugh,— (he always laughed if the majority indulged)—and never took the true people's-people's petition from his pocket! In justice must it be said, that, while that petition had been drawn up by himself ad hoosierandum, he was secretly glad to have it defeated. Still, he condoled with the signers, by lamenting and condemning “the unhappy state of indecorum at the time too prevalent in the House, which rendered it unadvisable to submit grave and important matters to their consideration!” Vol. II.—12 CHAPTER LVIII. “In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few! From rank to rank your vollied thunder flew!” Campbell. “— — — — never did I hear Such gallant chiding, for, besides the groves, The skies, the fountains, every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry!” This autumn was remarkable for wild pigeons. The mast had failed elsewhere; while with us, the oak, the beech, and all other nut trees, had never borne more abundant crops. The woods, therefore, teemed with hogs, squirrels, and all other nut-crackers, that, like the primitive men of poetry, preferred this acorn-life. How many swine were slaughtered this fall, I never learned: but, within six weeks, our upper and lower regiments of hunters, and simply by shooting occasionally around their clearings, on counting, at the muster, their squirrel scalps, found the sum more than 30,000!! As to pigeons, the first large flocks attracted no unusual notice: and, yet, were they mere scouting parties from the grand army! For, within a week, that army began to arrive, as though flocks had never before been seen! and all the birds under the whole heavens, had been congregated into one company! Had the leaves of our trees all been changed into birds, the number could have been no greater! With a friend, I stood in an open space in the woods, two miles east of Woodville, from 10 o'clock A. M. to 3 o'clock, P. M.—five hours—during which, with scarcely thirty seconds intermission, a stream of pigeons, about two hundred yards wide, and averaging two layers, flowed above us, and with the rapidity of thought! It was an endless hurricane on wings, rushing innoxious, yet with such an uproar as seemed to be prostrating the forests: and the deep reverberating thunder, in the distant wilds, seemed to announce the fall of their ponderous and ancient trees! Never had I felt the awe and solemnity of sound thus; even in beholding the wind-tempest pass over the same wilds, bowing the submissive woods, and bearing onward their wide tops, as if mown off with an angel's scythe! It will readily be thought, our hunters and sportsmen were in all places firing away at the living torrent: and yet, with but small loss to the pigeons. Rifles are useless in firing at very distant and flying troops; and we had not more than a dozen Leather-stockings in the Purchase, able to single out and kill a bird at a time. “Why not use shot-guns?” What a question! “Well —but why?” Why, first and foremost, that toy could not be found in twenty houses in the whole Purchase. Secondly, our men could hardly be coaxed to use the thing, both out of contempt, and, what may seem strange, out of a little fear; for, as Ned said, “the spiteful critter kick'd so powerful.” Beside, it is unfavourable to rifle-shooting to acquire the dodge taught by a shot-gun. But, lastly, the pigeons usually flew twenty yards above our trees—and that rendered the Mantons, or any best shot-guns, as efficacious nearly as—a quill and a slice of potato. However, all the shot-guns and horse-pistols were sought and fixed, so feverish became the excitement, and since there were half-cut backwoodsmen enough, and some degenerate natives to use them. But here was the next difficulty; powder was plenty,—yet, who had shot? In our store was not a pound; and it was the same almost in the others. Still, a few pounds were ferretted from lurking places, and readily sold at thirty-seven and half cents for a scant pound:—whence was proved, that a pound of lead in shot-shape, is not even as heavy as a pound of feathers!—the air-pump to the contrary notwithstanding. With immense persuasion, Ned and Domore consented to shoot horse-pistols: but they both utterly refused to fire off “store-shot.” And, like some others, they hammered bullets into bars; which were then cut into cubes and triangles, this being “a sort a-shootin bullets, and no inkuridjment to store-keepers to bring out their blasted baby shot!” In justice to my own manhood, it must be told, I stooped not to the shot concern till after several days' failure in hitting with my rifle, a single bird, at 140 yards, and moving as near like “the greased lightning” as possible: nor then, before the following accident showed there may be danger in firing a rifle as well as a shot-gun. Satisfied that the rifle must be fired now by the doctrine of chances, and not of “the sights;” and that the chance with one bullet was a “slim chance,” it seemed better to multiply chances, and load with two balls instead of one. And yet the spaces between the flying birds were as plentiful as birds; and, into these spaces the two balls chanced to go when they parted company, or, if they stuck together, it was, after all, but one chance. Therefore, we at last ventured on patching the balls separately; and then, indeed, the effect was considerably different; not, however, upon the pigeons, but at my end of the gun: for, at the flash, I was suddenly driven partly around, and with a tingling in the fingers supporting the barrel, while about me, for several yards, lay the silver mounting and ornaments of my rifle! “What was the matter?” The piece had burst; and the stock was shattered up to the spot sustained by my left hand! and, yet, had I received no material injury! On the same day, and from the same cause,—(air intercepted between the patched balls)—another rifle burst; and, although the owner remained with its butt only in his hand, he too was unharmed midst the scattered fragments of wood and iron. Ned's remark about the accidents, was paradoxical, for he “Bust his rifle, if he allowed a rifle would a-busted no how!” After this, I descended to the shot-gun. But, while I took my station in the opening already named, and, furnished with two and a half theoretic pounds of different sized shot, fired away till all was expended, I was rewarded with only two pigeons—these being from a small cloud that, by some accident, flew a few yards below the tree-tops, and both killed at one fire. One evening, shortly after sunset, Ned Stanley brought a report into the village, that the pigeons were forming an encampment for the night somewhere to the south-east. And, not long after, this was confirmed by Domore, who had surprised an out-post, nestling in the woods within a mile and a half of Woodville. Had a scout brought intelligence of a hostile Indian band, our town could not have been more effectually roused and speedily armed. And now, verily, shot-guns and shot rose a thousand per cent.—like caterpillars' eggs in the mulberry fever: and every where some body met any body and every body, legs and all, full tilt in search of the article! Turkeys, sang, coon-skins, ven's'n-hams, and even cash (hoarded to buy land!)—were offered for guns, pistols, and shot!—and, all round, could be seen and heard men and boys hammering, rolling, and cutting shot! Indeed, many intended to fire this extemporaneous shot out of— rifles! And when hunters, or even semi-hunters, can so demean these—the temptation and excitement must be prodigious! Some could not procure even rifles; and these persons, by the aid of Vulcanus Allheart and his boys, had old pistol and gun barrels hastily mounted on rude stocks, to be fired in partnership, one holding the matchlock, and the other “touching her off” with an ignited stick or cigar. “What was all this stir about?” Why, for a night attack on the Grand Roosting Encampment! For, since the Purchase became a purchase, never, in the memory of our oldest and most respectable squatters, had such an occurrence happened, as for the pigeons to roost so near Woodville! Now, some had read in Ornithology, and others had been told by people from Kentucky—oh! such wonders about roosts and encampments! how pigeons covered all the branches; and then perched on one another, till the trees became living pyramids of feathers! And how, then, all tumbled down and killed themselves, till the ground was covered with dead pigeons, oh! as much as two feet!—like quails round the Israelitish camp! Yes! and the pigeons slept so sound, and were so averse to flying in the dark, that you could walk up and gather birds from trees like wild-plums in a prairie! Ay! and the farmers used to camp near a roost, with droves of hogs; which, (after the farmers had barrelled up enough birds for winter,) were driven in every morning to be fattened on dead pigeons! “Did you believe all that, Mr. Carlton?” Well—I was but mortal—beside, every body said it would be such a most mighty powerful smart chance to get such a heap of pigeons! I did not, indeed, go as far as some; for I never expected to find them two feet high, already dead, and, maybe, picked and ready for the skillet. Beside, I wanted to go, and “who knows,” says I to myself, “if there mightn't be some truth in the account after all.” Hence, after five minutes cogitation, I hurried down after Clarence and Harwood—but, mark it, reader, I was met by those learned gentlemen, hastening up to Carlton's store, to consult on the same subject! For these persons, living in the edge of the forest, knew well enough that the pigeons were camping, from the thunderings, like the deep and solemn mutter of an earthquake, (although the nearest point of the camp proved nearly three miles distant,) and hence, quite as excited and credulous as we small fry, they were posting up town to join a party: “Which way? Which way? neighbours!” “Coming up to your store,—are you going down to College?” “I was—did you hear what Domore and Ned say?” “No—but, hark! don't you hear them?” “What!—is that the pigeons?” “To be sure!—Carlton, won't you go?” “That's what I was coming down for —” “That's your sort—agreed. Going to take a gun?” “No—guess not: all Woodville is out with guns—pistols—rifles—match-locks—and big keys, with touch-holes filed in—let's only take things to carry back birds in.” “Agreed—they say you can pick a barrel under a tree— what shall we take?” “Bags?” “Yes—and a long string to tie them by the legs, and carry back on a pole!” “Ready now, Carlton?” “Yes—yes—yes! let's keep on.” “Well, stop at my house,” said Clarence, “and there we'll fix a bag and some twine, and so lose no time.” All was done quick as a squirrel's jump. Then guided by the sound, we put out, regardless of a course, and unable to discern objects dubious in the dim light of a waning moon, and partly obscured by clouds. We were in Indian file,—now trotting, now running, and occasionally walking, —here stumbling over logs—there scrambling up and down gullies—then diving into sink-holes—then ripping through briar swamps! The conversation was monosyllabic and suggestive, performed with no little blowing and palpitation, and broken abruptly by exclamation, thus:— “Hark!” “Ye-e-s!” “Like—ooh!—thun-der!—hey!” “Ve-ry! Got—bag?” “Ooh!—yes! You—ooh!—got—string?” “Oho! ouch!—no! he's got it—ooh!” “What now? oho! ouch!—bad briars here!” &amp;c. &amp;c. In about two miles, even this laconic dialect was difficult to use, being lost in the roar of pigeon-thunder—mingling with which was heard, however, the artillery, the outcries and shouts of our gallant village troops! “Yes! hark!—they're pelting away! Come! come on! Get that bag ready—pull out those strings—hurraw!” And yet it was curious—we had come to no outposts! —had caught no drowsy sentinel pigeons on their roosts! What on earth made the thunder so late at night? How could pigeons, packed on one another, and with heads comfortably stuck under wings, keep up such an awful noise? Was it snoring? Ay! maybe it was the noise of pigeons tumbling down, and trees breaking — Hark! a storm rushes this way! How sudden the moon is hid! Is that a cloud? Yes, reader, it was a storm—but of pigeons rushing on countless wings! It was a cloud—but of careering and feathered squadrons! The moon was hid—and by a world of startled birds! In vain our search that night for pigeon bearing trees! In vain our bag and three strings! We might have filled a bolster with feathers; but no bird living or dead burdened either our sack or lines! The myriad hosts for miles and miles were on their wings! and guns were flashing away in hopeless vengeance and idle wrath! Neither shot nor ball could reach that world of wild fowl safe mid the free air of Heaven! Pitiful our bag and string!—pitiful our very selves! and all Woodville gazing from the dark depths of the woods upward on that boundless canopy of sounding, black, and rushing pinions! To remain was worse than useless—it was hazardous; at every flash of gunpowder, showers of shot foreign and domestic fell like hail on the leaves around us—and we fancied rifles cracked as if speeding balls, and that we heard the peculiar whistling of their death dealing music! And we turned to go home. But the way thither had now become a question. That we were about three miles distant was probable; yet after turnings and windings in the dark, our puzzle was no wonder. Besides the moon, as if unable to penetrate the cloud of wings, had never re-appeared; and clouds of another kind had succeeded, whence heavy and frequent rain-drops now pattered on us! At last we decided our course by instinct; in which we satisfactorily learned that human instinct is inferior to brute: for after a trot of ten minutes, sudden torchlights crossed our way at right angles, and a voice from one carrier thus hailed— “Hilloo! whar're you a travellin?” “To Woodville—whose that?” “To Woodville!—bust my rifle if you ain't a goin a powerful strate course on it—” “Why Ned, is that you?” “That's the very feller; why Mr. Carltin if you keep that course, you'll reach the licks about sun-up!—why this here's the way—foller our trail.” “Ha! ha! Ned, I thought I was a better woodsman— keep a-head, we'll follow.” “Well, you're puttee smart in the day-light, Mr. Carltin— but it's raythur more hardish to strike the course of a dark night.” 12* “Where's Domore, Ned?” “Foller'd arter the d— pigins —” “Don't swear, Ned, the preacher's here. Did you get any?” “Git any! Nobody didn't git none. Bust my rifle if this ain't a judjmint on the settlemint for firing shot guns and shot out a rifles!” “I think myself, Ned, shot guns had something to do in scaring the birds so. But how far yet to Woodville?” “Well, I can't jist about say sartinly—it taint more nor four miles no how—'spose we a sorter stop talking—it hinders runnin; and here goes for a fresh start.” And start fresh did Ned and his party, and at a rate extremely prejudicial to easy conversation, and giving us genteel folks work enough to keep in sight of the torches. In little more than an hour, however, we stood in the edge of the clearings; when our course being pointed out by Ned, the parties separated, and I went with Harwood and Clarence to take supper at the house of the latter,—a supper ready to greet our arrival with a bag and string of pigeons! I acknowledge it—this is a very tame and spiritless end of our pigeon tale—a very bad dove-tailing! Yet is it as natural as our flat and unprofitable feelings, when we sat down about twelve o'clock that night at Clarence's to an overdone, burnt up, tasteless supper—our poetry and romance all flown away with the pigeons, and washed out by the rain! However, we may add, that many followed the pigeons all night; and once or twice small flocks were found settled on trees where about one hundred in all were killed—but the grand body was never overtaken. It continued, perhaps, on the wing till a favourite roosting place some hundred miles south was reached, that being their direction. Domore got back at eight o'clock next morning, having done twenty-five miles and obtained twenty-two pigeons, with his hand, however, much injured by the recoil or bursting of his horse pistol. Hence shot guns were in worse odour than ever and no light curses heaped on “all sich spiteful bird skerers and them what made and shot em!” Domore, indeed, soon recovered: when his first rifle-shot afterward was so melancholy in its consequence, as to make him abstain from his favourite weapon and hunting for many months. With that account we conclude this chapter. He went out several hours before day-break and lay in wait at a salt-lick for a deer. Here he waited patiently till the dawn; and then opposite his station his keen eyes discovered in the bushes the cautious approach of an animal, and soon he caught a glimpse of its body. To flash his eye through the sights and to touch the trigger was instinctive—and then came the cry not of a wounded deer or bear, but of human agony! Domore flew to the spot; and what was his horror there to see bleeding on the ground and apparently dying, poor Jesse Hardy, his intimate friend, and the honest fellow who had been with us in the cave! He, too, had come to watch the lick; and had Domore been later than Hardy, their fates, perhaps, had been reversed! Generally great precaution is employed by our hunters to prevent such mishaps, yet sometimes with all, they do occur. Happily in the present case the wound, though severe, was not mortal, and Hardy in a few minutes so recovered as to speak; when Domore, after doing what seemed proper, left his friend for fifteen minutes, and then was again on the spot with the assistance of a neighbouring family. The wounded man was carefully removed to the cabin; and Domore mounting a horse darted away full speed for Dr. Sylvan. The Doctor came; and being a skilful surgeon, as he had in that capacity served in the war a regiment of mounted riflemen, he used the best means of cure; and in two months, by the divine favour, poor Jess was able to return to his domestic duties. During this confinement Domore did all he could for his friend, and also for the widow-mother, supplying as far as possible the place of a son; and although after Jess recovered, Domore hunted again with his rifle, he never again, while we were in the Purchase, went out to watch a lick. CHAPTER LIX. “Like other tyrants death delights to smite, What, smitten, most proclaims the pride of power And arbitrary nod. His joy supreme To bid the wretch survive the fortunate; The feeble wrap the athletic in his shroud And weeping fathers build their children's tomb.” Scarcely had the gloom from the late melancholy occurrence been dispelled before our settlements were trembling at reports of a coming, resistless, unpitying, destructive foe—the Asiatic Cholera! Innumerable were our schemes to turn aside, evade, or counteract, this fell disease; and all fear of other sickness and death was absorbed in fear of this! As if God had only one minister of vengeance, or of chastisement! As if He was to be dreaded in the thunder and tempest, and forgotten in the calmness and sunshine! Indeed, that only dreaded death then came not;—God sent another messenger of terror and of mercy—The Scarlet Fever! This disease appeared first and without apparent cause in the family of Dr. Sylvan. Thence, in a few weeks, it spread carrying death and mourning into most of our habitations. It followed no known law, sometimes yielding and then refusing to yield to the same treatment and in the same as well as different families: and often in other places resisting the established, or different, or even opposite treatment, and sweeping all into the grave! The cholera then had no alarms! The King of Terrors was among us in forms as frightful and destructive! Then was it, dear one! after days and nights of ceaseless and anxious watchings, and after fitful alternations of hope and fear, we saw those eyes, so soft and yet so brilliant, suddenly and strangely quenched—as though life had retreated thither to a last refuge and death, having long before triumphed o'er thy dear, dear form, did there, as a last act, put out that most precious light! What didst thou mean by those mysterious words in the dying strife?—“Father! father! how tired I am!” Was it so hard to die?— * * Didst thou hear, in answer, the wailings of bitterest anguish?—or feel on thy cold cheek the last kisses—while tears wet that face, changing and passing for ever? * * * Sleep, dear babe! in thy bed under the forest leaves, amid those lone graves—we shall meet, and, never to part—no! never! Clarence had buried two children in the far East: he was now called to lay another in the far West. That Sabbath morning can never be forgot! Among others, who suffered most, was our fellow-citizen Mr. Harlen. His four chidren were all deaf-mutes. Two of these had died in succession, at an interval of eight days: and, when the second lay in its little coffin, in front of the pulpit in the Methodist Chapel, the third, a fine boy, nine years old, distressed at some supposed error, stole from his weeping parents in the church, and, advancing to the coffin of his dead brother, placed the bier as to him seemed suitable and decorous! Poor darling one! on the next Sabbath, he lay in his own coffin on that same bier, and before that same pulpit! And another coffin, and another bier, were there—and the chief mourner was Clarence! The heart-broken parents of the mutes—(ay! mute, indeed, now!) —had entreated him to pray for themselves, if possible, that day in public! He did so. And over the coffins of their dead children, he spoke to others and himself too, words of consolation; and offered prayer to Him that can and did bind up the broken in heart, and raise up them that were bowed down! Mournful train! The vision is before me ever—as it emerges from the house of God! It slowly ascends the hill!—the two coffins!—the two stricken households!— the False One between friends at that double burial! The train is entering the Forest Sanctuary! They are separating, some to lay the deaf one with his kin—some to see the stranger lay his babe near my buried one! — — Reader! I now write many things in playfulness —none in malice—yet, years of my life passed, when sadness only was in my heart; and words and thoughts of pleasantness were impossible! Ay! the gloom of hell, if not its despair, possessed my soul! But, I have found religion not inconsistent with great and habitual cheerfulness. Nay, thoughts of death, judgment, and eternity, may be ever present and ever dominant in a mind taught by many sorrows to make light of the things of time and sense! How do these solemn words and things sort with thy cheerfulness? For, remember, by the agreement or disagreement, your character is: and that thine most certainly, as mine, are—Death—Judgment—Eternity!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SEVENTH YEAR. CHAPTER LX. “While he from one side to the other turning, Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck, Bespake them thus:—I thank you, countrymen: And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.” “Smooth runs the water, where the brook is deep, And in his simple show he harbours treason.” Cheer up! reader, only one and a half year more in the Purchase! In this time, we lived, also, very fast, and were so occupied with great matters as to overlook little things; therefore, we shall not be tedious. Beside, I am tired riding about; and hence, you will be dragged no more through the wooden world, except to the Guzzleton Barbecue. We now introduce a very uncommon personage, a most powerful prodigious great man, the first of the sort beheld in the New Purchase—the very Reverend Constant Bloduplex, D. D.—in all the unfathomable depths of those mystic letters! And this character, supposed to be invented for the purpose, will be an important study to the literati, whether branded on the head or the tail, D. D. or d. d.— P. or p.: and who aspire to dictate ex cathedra. All such strong-headed men can here receive important hints and directions, and have examples how best to discharge their official duties. We can now show “a thing or two:” and some never seen or heard of in the East! Yea! some which the wise Solomon himself never did or imagined in all his experiments, drunk or sober! “Indeed! go on then, sir.” Well, the Reverend Gentleman had lately written, to state his acceptance of the Presidency; although it would compel him to resign much more eligible stations, and make very unpleasant interruptions in his domestic comforts: and also, that he would be ready to set out for his new home in the early spring. In due season, followed a letter, naming the time his journey would be commenced, and when and where he might be met on the river. Then should you have been at Woodville, to see our folks hop about! All, at least, favourable to the conduct of the Board. However, some, opposed to rats, agreed to suspend hostilities; being persuaded by Dr. Sylvan, Mr. Clarence, and specially Mr. Harwood, that our President was a man of uncommon worth, talents, patriotism, and enterprise. Yet, a few honest, but perhaps mistaken, persons, from a sincere love of their own sectarianism, remained our opponents, if not our enemies. At present, we were the decided majority, and therefore the people's people: and so we determined to do things in style. Out of reverence, then,[44] [44] Adverb of time. Vide Murray—or some of his pilferers. to the man, and regard for his station, we resolved to meet him with an escort; to honour him with a procession, an illumination, and a feast! And all this was by and with the consent and advice, and under the superintendence, and at the expense mainly, of Clarence and Harwood, aided by Sylvan and Carlton. Hence, nemine contradicente, it was ordered: 1. That Mr. Carlton, Sen'r, and James Sylvan, Jun'r, be the escort from the river: 2. That the students prepare an illumination of the Colleges: 3. That Mrs. Clarence, and a dozen other feminine citizens, fix the President's house, and prepare his first supper: and 4. That Mr. Clarence be as ubiquitous as possible, and see that every thing was as straight as—a shingle. At the proper day, the escort started. On passing through villages and loggages, we so fired up the citizens, that in many places, it was promised to meet our Great Man with inferior processions, like an ovation—the Grand Triumphal being to be at Woodville. In one town, with a Jewish name, we met no encouragement—not from want of good-will in the inhabitants, but simply because there were no inhabitants there. Like Goldsmith's village, it was deserted—the inhabitants having all been shaken out by the ague: although we could not say, as some one of Ireland, “in it snakes are there none.” Finally, after an uncommon abrasion of inexpressible-seats, and green baize leggins—(for, like Gilpin, we rode, if not for a wager, yet for a President)—we dismounted and tied our horses at the Ohio. (N. B. The MS. here was so blotted, the Editor could not read it.) — — and — — but the steamer was now seen descending on the swollen bosom of the waters, belching fire and smoke as if in labour, and longing to be delivered of the great weight of character and influence she was painfully bearing to our inland wilds—apt likeness, too, of Man of Puffs! Oh! the exciting moment! Now! we shall see a Man!—we shall have the honour of riding before him—of showing him to the natives, as Boswell showed Johnson to the Scotchmen! and — — — (Here my friend Mr. C. seems to have been so nervous that his MS. defies my powers to decipher—several pages, therefore, are necessarily omitted.—Editor.) “— — when, then, do we set off, Mr. Carlton?” “To-morrow morning, Doctor. We will now cross the river, and join your family on the New Purchase side.” “Is this our skiff?” “Yes, sir. Well, since we are afloat, Doctor, how do you think you will like our wooden country?” “Don't name it, sir. I already repent my precipitancy: if all could be recalled, I should be better pleased.” “You surprise me, Dr. Bloduplex!” “Yes, sir, I have been hasty: I would gladly be in my former place.” “But, our College — ” “Mr. Carlton, plague me not about the college—I shall have plenty of that when I get to Woodville.” Conversation, where one is ardent and the other cold, becomes sissee or zizzy:—a dialogue between cold water and hot iron. Our escort had too much at stake in the success of the institution, not to feel now something like a damper on his spirits; and he, therefore, remained in a ruminating way the rest of the passage—nay, during the evening—yea, when he got into bed. In vain chastised he his own zeal, as too zealous—in vain apologised for the President's want of firmness and lack of interest in Woodville matters—it did still occur that the good Doctor should have counted the cost, and been absorbed in the “great enterprise for which he had willingly and joyfully sacrificed himself?” Had he not “left riches, and honours, and glories” of the Wheelabout country deliberately and “conscientiously”—and ought he not to have had a little patience with an escort that “had paid the postage” of a horse, and nearly ruined a pair of green leggins and a pair of blue unmentionables? And then sneaked in remembrances of conversations with certain “Brethren,” intimately acquainted with the President's remarkable life and history—conversations once attributed to envy, and jealousy, and odium theologicum—and yet so cognate to the late behaviour—that battle the suspicion as he would, it did seem, as they said, “we should soon find out and be bitterly disappointed with Dr. Bloduplex—that he was no safe confidant—and if we slighted warning, we should in the end find a person that could blow hot and cold with the same breath.” However, we resolved to make the inland journey pleasant, and honourably to do the escortorial duties, and boldly throw away all suspicions and uncharitable inferences—yet to be guarded. When, therefore, next day the President showed a phase different from the one in the boat, the author, after listening now to an enthusiastic sermon on Colleges, Woodville, the Far West in general, the Mississippi valley in particular, and the nobleness of doing good for goodness' sake—away packing sent he his base and injurious suspicions, and began, in the amiable weakness of his nature, to look up to the Doctor with even greater admiration, and no small admixture of filial reverence! And then in his turn—being of course all the time on his guard!— Mr. C. opened his budget, and told about Woodville, and the peoples, and the Trustees, and Harwood, and Clarence, and Allheart, and Domore, and Ned, and all! “That was indiscreet, Mr. Carlton.” Granted: but we felt then like a son with a father—were anxious to make amends for our mental injury—and beside, this leaky state of our mind seemed so to interest the good Doctor—and he condescended to ask so many leading questions—and laughed and cried so easy and naturally at various narrations. Indeed, he innocently started fresh leaks in a vessel that never held well at the best—but like Robert Hall's, the noble Baptist, used to pour out at the slightest excitements: or, to change the figure, the Doctor finding water increasing in the hold, managed the pumps so adroitly and incessantly as to empty the whole chest—or some such place in the body corporate, where secrets are contained. “Still, sir, you were too much of a gossip.” Ah! but consider, dear reader, we had nothing else to talk about. Moreover, I only gave story for story: and whenever I told any thing about Woodville, he matched it with something about Wheelabout. And in these he contrived to anticipate and answer all inquiries that perchance might be some day instituted concerning History, in that region—till I looked on him as a hero, statesman and saint, basely maligned, persecuted and driven—(for driven it seemed he had been)—away by cruel foes and unjust popularity. “What did he tell you?” Excuse me:—I can tell—but that would betray what was told in confidence! And I am not so great a man as Dr. Bloduplex, and must not look so high for an example, although twelve months after this ride the Doctor—did remember all my gossip, things said playfully and idly, and some seriously, and did narrate and comment on them, and draw inferences from them, and that before discontented students, collected at his house—before Dr. Sylvan alone— before the Board of Trustees convened as a court of trial! Ay! and so full to overflowing was his remarkable memory, that he recollected “what Mr. Carlton should have told him!”—but which Mr. Carlton never did tell him! However, let us get back to Woodville. On the way, before arriving at a village, James Sylvan, Jun., would hasten forward to announce our approach; when, by previous arrangement, we were met half a mile south of each clearing, and honoured with the ovation: immediately after which we usually had another in the shape of eggs and bacon. At Melchisede cville our courier—a little waggishly—simply announced the President! In the course of the evening our hotel was duly visited by some democrats in shirt sleeves, and some without a shirt—to see that old character—President Hickory-Face! They saw, however, a hero with a much smoother phiz, of softer words, but in all probability of a tougher conscience. By the end of the third day, we could hear the cow-bells jingling homeward towards Woodville. The cows, a little in advance, were hurried forward by our courier, in a long line, with unwonted speed, unusual clamour, great mud-splashings and tail lashings; from all which it was conjectured by the look-outs in the edge of the Woodville clearing, that something was coming! Indeed, as nothing else could have produced such commotion and uproar, Professor Harwood mounted into the crotch of the great old Beech at the Spring, and peering thence into the forest, he soon exclaimed: “Fall in! fall in!—Sylvan's behind the cows! I see his handkerchief waving on his whip! Fall in! the President is coming?” Hence when we came within a few rods of the clearing, there sure enough they all stood in double file— “What! the cows!” Pshaw! no—but Harwood, and the students, and the citizens—all in their Sunday clothes! And then taking off their hats—all, I mean, that had any—they gave us, as we passed between the opened lines, three or four most terrific cheers! How the President felt I know not—but I, fondly hoping our college and town were both made—I was fairly lifted above my horse! and stood in the stirrups! I rejoiced as for my own honour,—thinking, too, I foresaw the rapid and lasting growth of learning, and science, and civilization, and religion. That Clarence rejoiced also, I well know— it was for this he had voluntarily stood aside and made room for an “elder, I did not say, a better soldier!” That Harwood rejoiced likewise, I well know—nay, without Harwood's suggestions and after efforts, Bloduplex had yet been in the peacefulness of his earlier wars—the triumph of his first victories over the incautious and open hearted! And yet that Harwood was soon hurled from his own office —his living taken away—his reputation!—but stay, we must not write faster than we lived, although very fast did we now live, if a large experience of evil constitute fast living! We omit the supper, and pass to the illumination. Pause we, however, to state that, in addition to Little College and Big College, we boasted now a third edifice, which may properly here be styled Biggest College. Some time since our Board had ordered the erection of a new building, and appointed a Committee to carry the order into effect; who, being carpenters and masons, lost no time, but taking the contract themselves, went immediately to work. Hence, one morning was very unexpectedly seen a surveyor running a line across the Campus, driving down stakes, &amp;c.—and also several labourers digging a foundation! Professor Harwood accidentally passing, asked in surprise what was meant: and he was answered, “it's for the New College!” “College!!—why we have no plan yet.” “Plan!—why it is to be like the Court-House—and aint that big enough?” The next moment Harwood was at my store; and out of breath began: “I say, Carlton!—do you know what's going on our way?” “No: what?” “Why they're digging away at the foundation of the new College— “No! you're quizzing — ” “Quizzing!—yes, quiz it will be on a large scale: they are actually going to put up a building the express size and pattern of that odious Court House!” `Impossible!—let's go down and stop it.” And, sure enough, there was a foundation marked off for a building exactly square, about 50 feet to the side! Happily we had some influence, and some trustees had some shame: and hence, while the work could not be stopped, the contracts having been secretly disposed of and shared among our own trustees and their friends, an order was procured for an enlargement of the affair, making the house 30 feet longer; and instead of two, three stories high! And this is the true history, although Dr. Bloduplex prided himself with having suggested in his letters “the just proportions:” the proportions, just or unjust, were wholly accidental, and owing to the cupidity of the contractors, and not to the love of classical or unclassical architecture. Well, on the memorable night of the President's arrival, Little and Big Colleges were very tastefully illuminated in the eastern way; but on Biggest College, then incomplete, had been raised above the roof a pole perpendicular to the apex. The upper end of said pole, passed through the centre of radiating pieces bounded by a circumference, and continued to rise yet a few feet. Near its top crossed a bar at right angles; and at each end of the bar a candle represented a Professor—a very large candle on the extremity of the pole itself personated the President. The Students stood in other candles around the circle below, and just described; so that the Greater and Lesser Lights of the Purchase glimmered forth to night, in all the glory and effulgence of cotton wick and beef-tallow. It was a proud night! and not undelightful our emotions and anticipations, as we stood in the edge of the wilderness, late the lurking place of the Indian, and yet concealing the bear, the wolf, the panther, and gazed on those symbolical tapers! It did seem that Mind in its march had halted and erected her standard! But even while we gazed, those tapers became oddly extinguished! First, one after another, died away the lights of the circle!—then the lights at the extreme ends of the bar, first Clarence, then Harwood!— while the light topping the pole was left, feebly burning, indeed, and spluttering, yet triumphant and alone! “Was that ominous of what follows?” So Aunt Kitty insists. Beside, she fortified her superstition by a dream! She dreamed that very night! that Mr. Clarence was seated in his great rocking chair, on the top of Biggest College, and that a wind, insidious, noiseless, and yet resistless, came like a double-blowing tornado, and hurled him to the earth! Events soon happened strangely corroborative of the old lady's ideas and misgivings—and we can only account for those things, as Southey for the unaccountables, in Wesley's life—“there are more things in heaven,” &amp;c. Some said the Top Candle burnt and smoked the longest, because it contained the largest amount of gross animal matter, and was most wick-ed; but still that, you know, does not account satisfactorily for Aunt Kitty's dream, does it? CHAPTER LXI. “Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes, For villainy is not without such rheum: And he, long traded in it, makes it seem Like rivers of remorse, and innocency.” President Bloduplex was, as is usual, the son of his father and mother, being born in very early life, at an uncertain moment of a certain day or night, near Wheelabout. His talents were good; his acquirements respectable especially in Classics, Antiquities, History, and Literature in general;—still they were not uncommon. In Mathematics and Sciences, we cannot state his attainments; and simply because we never discovered them—yet he must have got beyond arithmetic, since Clarence, in return for aid in Greek, did gratefully assist the Doctor in Algebra. Harwood, indeed, thought the President's attainments in such matters inconsiderable; but then Harwood was Professor of Mathematics and may have expected too much. At all events the President set no great value on these matters, making himself merry at Clarence's expense, on accidentally discovering that this gentleman was studying Mathematics under the guidance of his friend Harwood, while Harwood read Latin and Greek with Clarence. As a companion, no man could be more agreeable than our President. It was this led our young Professors to unbosom in his presence—and even when, in an unguarded moment, the President remarked—“friendship is a word I have blotted from my vocabulary!”—they thought he suspected other men only and not themselves. But before long it was found he had confidence in nobody; and that he looked on all men as enemies, to be managed, resisted, counteracted, circumvented. This was his proton pseudos, to imagine all sorts of wickedness and chicanery in all others; and then to combat all with such weapons as he fancied they were using or would use against him! Hence said Harwood once,—“depend on it, when Bloduplex tells us of the meanness, and duplicity, and falsehood, and machinations of Doctor Red and others in Wheelabout, towards himself, he has used the same towards them.” But Harwood was a young man, and may have been mistaken. Doctor B. was an excellent preacher, and a still better lecturer, whether is regarded the matter or the manner: Vol. II.—13 and some of his pulpit exhibitions were surpassingly fine. His theological opinions, like the Oxford Tracts, were for the “Times:” his only decided opinion in theology being that “there were worse men in hell than Judas Iscariot.” Like King David, our President, but in a different sense, had been “a man of war from his youth;” and in some adroit way—(he attributed it partly to his elocution)—he had usually worsted his enemies and even his friends, too, in ecclesiastical combats before the clerical courts! Indeed, so thoroughly had he devoured things as to have “used himself up!” One demolished brother in the middle east attributed the victory over himself to the “Doctor's peculiar memory, which had no tenacity in things that made against himself, but retained all and more too of such as were in his own favor.” But that was the fault of his Phrenological organization; and he only acted in obedience to the laws of his nature. My own opinion is, President B. owed most of his victories—and some of his defeats—to his Wonderful Religious Experience! which in the stereotyped crying places always when first heard inclined weak believers to his side! I well know the peril of meddling with this Experience; since the Doctor soberly arraigned both Clarence and Harwood for sniggering when they heard its third or fourth repetition—although the Judges would not condemn the accused, inasmuch as a moiety of said Judges did snigger and sneer a little themselves when the Experience was enacted for them! Ay! the Player did sometimes so overdo this part as not only to look excessively silly, but to see in other men's faces that he had been making a special fool of himself! “A donkey,”—says æsop—“boasting descent from a generous race horse, failed, however, in a certain race; when, humbled and ear-fallen, he had a shadowy recollection of his father—an A S S.” A dim remembrance of that donkey's true progenitor, very respectfully named in more than one solemn court and conclave, and as an accompaniment to the Religious Experience, may enable our worthy Divine, if he still live, to see one reason why, (if, he failed not often to destroy his foes,) he has so completely destroyed himself. “Yes—but, by your own account, he did overthrow both Clarence and Harwood.” Reader—a double-cone seems to be rolling up hill, on its inclined planes: and yet is it all the time really going down hill! According to his threat, he did “trample both Trustees and Faculty under his feet;”—but it has proved to himself only a rolling up-hill downwards! Some will think we are manufacturing a character: and, maybe, crities will say it is a very poor one after all, and that any second rate genius could have invented a much better. Well, honesty is the best policy; and, although it may affect the sale of the book one way or the other, we must say that Bloduplex is really a fictitious character! CHAPTER LXII. “Contention, like a horse Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose, And bears down all before him.” Such being our Fictitious Bloduplex, can any critic say, a priori, what will be suitable action? Perhaps, the popular inductive method had better been followed, and the ascent to the character taken place from the actions a posteriori: and that would have sorted with our President's favourite English use of that backsided logical phrase. Let none, here, exclaim, Mystery! We live in a mysterious age. Is it not the era of Animal Magnetism?—of Phreno, or Phrensy-magnetism?—of Transubstantiation? —Repudiation?—Wax Candles?—Holy Vestments? Is there not a laying, all through the pomps and vanities of the world, clear up to heaven, a Spiritual Rail Way, by which a vile sinner, touched and started by the proper persons, or their deputies and proxies, shall be in glory in a jiffey?—and that whether puritanically converted and sanctified or not! But— Dislike was, in due time, expressed by the President for his Cabinet, conjectured to spring from—1. His jealousy of equals, and suspicious and untrustful temper: 2. His determination for a very low grade of studies—especially in Mathematics, and even in Classics,—he being resolved to level down and not up: 3. His love of ease, and wish to get along with a relaxed, or rather no discipline: 4. His using discipline as an instrument of avenging himself on students disliked by him: 5. His domineering and tyrannical temper: 6. His prying disposition, by which he was led to have spies in the professors' classes, and to watch when they came and went to and from duties, &amp;c.: 7. His desire to make room for former pupils and relatives: 8. His erroneous theology. Hence, without consulting his peers, nay, contrary to the known wishes and earnest remonstrances, he tried to discipline students at will, and to suspend and dismiss; he permitted some to be graduated, and who now hold imperfect diplomas, signed with his sole name: and he commanded what the Professors should and should not do, and what teach, and how, answering their arguments with insult and derision, and threatening to stamp them and the trustees also under his feet! He pretended to think, and dared to assert, that the discipline of a College was of right a President's special duty,—and teaching, the Professors'. And, therefore, he rudely, on several occasions, contradicted his Faculty in public, and aimed to consider and treat them as boys! Nay, once, after permitting a young gentleman openly and grossly to insult a member of the Faculty, he stated in public, that unless that member and that pupil could make it up! the student or Professor must leave the College!! He was the master of the school,—his Professors mere ushers! He arbitrarily prescribed—first, their duties, and then, dared enter their recitation rooms to ascertain in person if they were competent and faithful teachers: where, after asking questions of the students, showing always his impertinence and insolence, and not rarely his ignorance of the subjects, he said to those pupils, and in the very presence of their Professors, that if not fully satisfied with the teachers' explanations and instructions, they would come to his study, he would supply the deficiencies!!! “Mr. Carlton! — were your Professors men? Why, Professor Spunk, of our place, would have kicked him out!” Softly: Clarence was a Clergyman, and Harwood good natured. For a while, too, amazement kept them speechless: and after that they were inclined to take, as a perpetual apology for the President's rudeness, what he once offered as such to the students themselves, for a hasty act of discipline, viz.:—“that his nerves had been disordered by a cup of strong tea the night before, taken incautiously with a guest, and that in such cases he was sometimes forgetful and hasty!” Clarence, indeed, always insisted that the poor Doctor was, at times, partially deranged; and that, even after receiving the following anonymous letter: — — — (Note:—The Editor is unwilling to print the letter, and so he always told Mr. C.) This letter, Clarence, on opening his pocket Virgil, left as usual on the mantel of his recitation room, found in the book: and, not suspecting its character, he thought he would run it over before commencing the lesson. The hand-writing being apparently the President's, Clarence, conceiving that his master had chosen this way to lecture for some over-sight, looked for no signature. And, therefore, he read till the ending, when the absence of all signature so perturbed him, that he got through with the recitation mechanically and by instinct! Great was his distress:—could it be that Bloduplex was so cowardly and vile to write such a letter! ordering him to resign, and threatening if he would not! Yet, his was the hand-writing!—the style!—the very expressions!— the every thing!—but the signature, and that was wanting! When this letter was thus found, it was a time of restored peace and renovated confidence—for, Clarence, being then a man of implicit faith and trustfulness of spirit—(having faith in man! according to the modern doctrine of Lyceums)—had, child-like, looked over the past, and hoped afresh for the future; * * * Down went he, after recitation, as usual, to the Doctor's study—but, accidentally, the door was locked! Then called he Harwood from his room, and, without uttering a word, put the letter into his hand. That gentleman read, and trembled as he read,—and, when Clarence asked— “Who do you think wrote it?” he answered— “I am afraid to say! but it seems like the Doctor,—the style—the hand-writing—the expressions—are so like his!” Hastening home, Clarence handed the letter to his wife, and without word or comment. She read; but, soon bursting into tears, she voluntarily exclaimed— “Oh! Charles!—the Doctor must have written this!” Harwood had now joined them: when the anonymous letter was compared with several letters written by Bloduplex to Clarence, and the most remarkable similarity, as to the hand—the style—the words—the expressions—was apparent: nay, in some things, was an identity. And all this, even Dr. Sylvan afterwards acknowledged; although with characteristic caution, he expressed no opinion as to the authorship. “Do not resign —” “I must, Harwood: external enemies and mistaken men, I could and can resist, and face;—but this domestic traitor —” “Perhaps, after all, it is not he.” “Perhaps so; yet, I cannot endure the suspicion. And, suppose he learns or guesses our suspicion—mutual confidence can never be again after that. No. I am now awake: and let me say, dear Harwood, that that man has some plan for you when he is rid of me.” “Oh! you are too much alarmed—he cannot be meditating that;—we shall be too strong for him —” “Depend on it, I am right. What we have heard of his character is true: and he that has, by indirect means, gained victories over ecclesiastical courts, will, by the same, gain them over us. I must and will resign.” “At least, see the Doctor first.” “I will—but I know the result:—it will end in my resignation, and in your final overthrow.” Clarence accordingly, taking the letter, waited on the President, who, meeting him at the door of his dwelling, did himself thus begin:— “You received an anonymous letter, Mr. Clarence, I hear?”—(Who told him?) “Yes, sir; and I have come to you for advice.” “Let us walk up the lane. Have you the letter with you?” “Here it is.” The letter was taken by the President, but not read all carefully and indignantly over, as by the others! And yet, at a glance, he learned all its items, and that so well, as to talk and comment on them! But still, after what he designed should pass for a searching scrutiny, in a moment he exclaimed,—“I know the hand writing—it is Smith's!” “How you relieve me, Doctor Bloduplex,” said Clarence; “Harwood was right to prevent me from sending in my resignation.—I shall continue —” “Mr. Clarence,” replied the President, “Smith, I know, is your bitter enemy; and I am told you have many more, and especially among the young gentlemen that came with me: now, this letter shows a state of great unpopularity, and I do candidly advise, all things considered, that you had better resign!!” “Doctor, pardon me, my first belief is returned—I know the author of this letter, and it is not Smith.” “Who then, sir?” “Come with me, Dr. Bloduplex, and I will satisfy you in my study.” “I cannot now, sir, but will call in the course of the day.” After a while the President called, when Clarence, conducting him into the study, said: “Dr. Bloduplex, from my inmost soul I do hope you may remove my suspicion;—but I much fear that you yourself are the author of this letter!” “I!—the author! how could you ever entertain so unjust a suspicion?” “God grant, sir, it be unjust—but I will now give you the grounds of my suspicion.” “Name them, sir,—I am curious and patient.” Here Clarence went over all that the reader has been told, but to a much wider extent, and with many arguments and inferences not now narrated; and then spread out the Doctor's own letters, to be compared with the anonymous one. Upon which the Doctor said: “Well, Mr. Clarence, there is no resemblance between them, or but very little.” “But is there not some? Has not the writer tried to imitate your hand—your style—your very grammatical peculiarities?” “It does, maybe, seem a little so —” “It does, indeed, Doctor Bloduplex; and now look here!—the seal is stamped with the key of your desk!” Here the President coloured; of course in virtuous indignation and surprise at such roguery, and in some little confusion exclaimed:— “The wicked dogs! they have stolen the key of my desk!” Clarence was here affected to tears; that one the other day almost loved and trusted as a father could be by him no longer so regarded. Ay, hoping against hope that the man could not be so fallen from high honour, and looking towards him with streaming eyes, he said: “Only assure me, Doctor, on your word of honour and as a Christian that you did not do this base action, and even now will I burn this letter in this very fire—(it was a cold day)—before your face.” “Mr. Clarence,” said he “I solemnly declare I did not write the letter; but stay, do not burn it—let me have it and I will try and find the writer.” The worthy President then carried away the letter and retained it three days in his surtout pocket; after which he returned the paper—but alas! the friction of the pocket, or something else, had so worn away the seal that the impression of the desk-key was no longer visible! Of course, then, the letter was not written by the Reverend Constant Bloduplex, d. d.—for he had the best right to know; and he said, solemnly, that it was not. Yet 13* Clarence, “all things considered,” did that very week send his resignation to Dr. Sylvan; offering, however, to remain till the meeting of the Board. At that the Board offered him nearly double salary to remain some months longer till a suitable successor could be found; to which proposal Clarence acceded. When that gentleman leaves the stage, our history, dear reader, is concluded. Meanwhile pass we to the next chapter and refresh ourselves with the Guzzleton Barbecue. CHAPTER LXIII. “I'll give thrice so much land To any well-deserving friend: But in the way of bargain, mark ye me, I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.” “Now, my co-mates, and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp?” Before his marriage, John Glenville had located on the river; where, being part owner of a tract of land, it was determined to make the village of Guzzleton. And of all places in the world this was a—place. It abounded in wood and water, and was convenient to the river, or—could be so; the county road went within half a mile, and if desired would, no doubt, come right through the town; and there might be rail-roads and canals across it, in every direction. Nay, all the advantages of Paperville itself would in due time concentrate in Guzzleton! Yea, it would eclipse Woodville! Ay, and if some folks did not look sharp, the Legislature would remove to Guzzleton the State College, or at least create there a branch College! Hence, in the tremendous excitement, lots at the first sale, were bid off at fine prices, to be paid afterwards; and then the settlers began to pour in and build! But after Glenville's own dwelling and store-house, Tom Beecher's tannery, and two cabins, one for a cobbler and the other for a tailor, had been erected, the rage for improvement ceased; and as yet the place was only Little Guzzleton! The Patroons, however, thought if a Fourth of July could be got up and the place become a centre for stump-speeching, electioneering, horse-jockeying and other democratical excellences, a fresh start would be given to its growth, and the town become Great Guzzleton. Hence this summer, on the Fourth, was to be there a grand Barbecue, with the reading of the Declaration of Independence, and great speeches from Robert Carlton of Woodville, and other fellow-citizens! On the third of July, Harwood and myself went over to indulge in a prefatory “cut up” with Glenville, and to witness the arrangements for the Barbecue. And as such an affair may be novel to some, we shall confine ourselves to that; taking for granted most have once or twice heard the Declaration and also the patriotic orations of the season. The spot for the Barbecue was an enchanting plateau below the cliff on which Guzzleton stood, and yet sufficiently above the river, to be considered table land. It was about one hundred yards long by fifty yards wide, and covered with fine and luxuriant grass, usually cropped by cows and horses, but now smoothly and evenly mown with scythes. The hackberry, the buckeye, the sycamore, and other trees, less abundant than elsewhere, were, yet, plentiful enough for ornament and shade; and this had led to the selection. Near the centre of this sylvan saloon was the table. This was eminent for strength more than elegance; but still for the place, the occasion, and the company, was the very table. Cabinet work would have sorted poorly with the wildness. The table was one hundred and fifty feet long; and consisted of two-inch planks in double layers, resting every ten feet on horizontal pieces of saplings; which in turn were supported by strong forked saplings planted several feet in the earth. Neither nail of iron, nor peg of wood, confined the planks—they reposed by their own gravity. Yet an unphilosophical arrangement of fixins, or an undue resting of plebeian arms and elbows did, now and then, disturb the gravity of the table in places; and that disturbing the gravy upset also the gravity of the company—specially the ungreased portion. Seats differed from the table in being lower and not so wide. They ran pretty near parallel with its sides; and were low enough, that our mouths be as near the food as possible—so that if the legs were judiciously disposed under the table, and the head properly inclined above, the contents of one's plate could be shovelled into the masticating aperture with amazing dexterity and grace. On each side of the table, ten feet distant and at intervals of five feet, were planted in the earth small trees with all their green and branching tops; and these tops, forced together and tied with bark-twines over the table, formed a romantic arcade seemingly of living trees evoked by the wand of enchantment to adorn and shade! Far as possible from the arcade, was the place of the Barbecue Proper. And that was a truly gigantic affair! It was no contemptible smoke-jack, steam-spit, rotary-stove contraption to cook a morsel of meat and a half a peck of potatoes with an apron of chips! or two hands full of saw-dust! or a quart of charcoal! It contemplated no fricasee for two or three guests beside the family! No! no! it was to do whole pigs! whole sheep! whole calves! whole turkeys! whole chickens! and for a whole settlement—and all other settlements invited as guests! A trench was cut in the ground some twenty feet long, four wide and three deep! And that trench was full of logs lying on brushwood, all to be set on fire that night, that a mine of living coals be ready for the morning's cookery! On the Fourth, about day-light, fresh logs and brush were added; and thus in due time this whole kitchen was a glowing and burning mass! Strips of nice white hickory were, at cooking time, laid at intervals across the fiery trench; their ends resting on stones or green logs along the edges of the range, and thus constituting a clean, simple, and most gigantic wooden gridiron. And then the beasts and birds, properly cleaned, skewered, peppered, salted and so on, were all and at once, spread out whole over the mammoth hickory iron; each creature being divided longitudinally on its bosom side! And each was kept spread out by hickory pieces or stretchers, and seasonably turned by two men, on opposite sides, with long hickory forks and pokers! Never such a cooking! It seemed as all the edible creatures of the Purchase had taken an odd fit to come and be barbecued for the mere fun of it! Nor was this wholesale barbecuing deemed sufficient! During the evening of the third, and early on the fourth, backwoodswomen were hourly arriving with boiled hams, loaves of wheat, pones, pies, tarts, sorrel-pies, Irish potato-pies—and things unknown to fashionable gourmands and confectioners;—also, meal in bags, and baskets, till provisions were piled in kitchen, and arbours, and carts like —oh! like—everything! Our Fourth was ushered by the roar of Hoosier artillery— log-guns done by boring solid trunks with a two-inch augur. These filled with powder, and stopped with a wooden plug, were fired by means of an ernormous squib, or slow match; and made a very reasonable noise considering they could rarely be fired more than once, being wonderfully addicted to bursting! The day itself was bright and cloudless; and during the greatest heat we were so sheltered under the grand old trees, and our enchanted arcade, as not to be oppressed; while the river flowed below, its waters now smooth and deep, now leaping and rustling over shoals, and now whirling in eddies around the trunks of fallen trees! its pure white sands looking like granulated snows—till the very sight was refreshing! At last, three beech cannon, our signal guns, were fired and burst; when the procession was formed on the cliff and in the very centre of Guzzleton—in posse; and this— (the procession, not the posse)—consisted, not only of menbodies, but of womenbodies also; since true woodsmen wish their ladies to share in all that is pleasant and patriotic. Then headed by a drum and fife, aided by the triangle already celebrated, and with as many flags flying as were pocket-handkerchiefs to spread out and wave on poles, we took up the line of march; we, the leading citizens, who were to read and speak; and then the common and uncommon citizens; and then certain independent ladies: and then young ladies with escorts; and then the boys; and then finally the rabble. After showing ourselves in the woods and bushes along the future streets of Great Guzzleton, and passing the store, and the tannery, and the two cabins, we descended the cliff and marched to the speaker's scaffold to the tune of Yankee Doodle—or something tolerably like it; although to-day the drum beat the other instruments hollow! The literary feast ended, we again formed the procession, and marched to the head of the arcade, while the music very judiciously played “Love and Sausages.” There halted, our lines were separated, and duly marshaled each proceeded along its own side of the table; when at a signal we halted again, and now opposite one another, to perform “the set up.” And this delicate manœuvre was very handsomely executed by all that wore trousers; but the wearers of frocks and petticoats showed want of drill, making an undue exhibit of white thread stockings and yarn garters. In some places, however, active and skittish maids stepped first on to the seat, and then with an adroit movement of one hand, as in going to milk a cow, held affairs in a very becoming tuck till the blushing damsels were safe between the table and the seat. We may not recount our jokes, and raillery, and tilting of tables, and sinking of seats, and spilling of gravy, and upsetting of water; only all such were on the same large scale that best sorted with the inartistical and undisciplined world around! Tit for tat, and even butter for fat, was largely done that day—and in a way to demolish nice bodies. But never was more good humour! never heartier fellowship! No drunkenness, however, and no profanity! No breaking of wine glasses—no singing of nasty songs—no smoking of cigars—no genteel and polished doings at all. We were then too far West for refinements! “No reflections—Mr. Carlton. But what did all that cost and what did you pay for a ticket?” Cost!—pay for a ticket! why don't you know? And yet how should anybody brought up where they sell a penneth of salad! and pay a fippenny-bit to walk in a garden and buy tickets to hear sermons, and eat temperance dinners!—and everything costs something, whether to eat, or drink, or smell, or touch, or look at!—everything, every thing except preaching and teaching! Cost! why nothing in the sense you mean. All was a contribution—a gift —everybody did it—and everybody ate and drank that was invited, and everybody that was not invited! “But it was a great labour!” To be sure it was. But what to a woodsman is labour with the rifle and the axe? A single shot killed each victim for the hickoryism; and a few flourishes of the axe felled trees and saplings for fuel, seats, tables, and arcades. “What's the use of a Barbecue any how?” Well, its uses to Guzzleton may be mentioned in some other work. But we answer now by asking:—Has not a man, who ranges in a wide forest untrammelled by artificial forms, an invincible love of freedom?—Will not he who feasts like Homer's heroes despise the meannesses of a huckster's life?—Can he be content to live on alms of broken meat and filthy crumbs?—Is there much hope of subduing men whose pastimes are to the effeminate, labours! And, dear reader, out there the noble Declaration of Independence itself, when properly read and commented on, as to-day by John Glenville, has an effect on backwoodsmen, such as is rarely felt now in here! Oh! could you have seen Domore, and Ned Stanley, and old man Ashmore, and Tom Robinson, rise at one or two places and clench their rifles convulsively—and with tearful eyes and quivering lips stand intently gazing on the face of that reader!— oh! could you have heard the enthusiastic cries, at the close, that came warm bursting from the very hearts of our congregation, men, women and children—then would you have deemed perilous the attempt to put, by force, a yoke on such necks! Vain the belief that our native woodsmen can be tamed! Numbers may, perchance, have destroyed their forest bulwarks—but in the doing, woodsmen and their foes would all have fallen down slain together! I only add that notwithstanding the continuous feasting of many hundreds for four or five hours, large quantities— nay, heaps of provisions, were left; and that these in the spirit of native western hospitality, were divided among the poorer of the guests, who carried away with them food enough for a week. The day passed without any important accident or lasting anger. It was, indeed, very like the colour and thrill of visions in my dreaming age! I have pic-nicked in pretty places, and with amiable and excellent people—I have heard sweet music and merry laughter in the graceful and dwarfish groves of the east—but the thrill came not there! My poor, foolish fancy wanders then far away off to that wild plateau of the Silver River, and sighs for the sylvan life of that rude Barbecue! CHAPTER LXIV. “Eloquar an sileam?” “Out with it, sir!” “Spectatum admissi risum teneatis?” “You won't laugh then?” Clarence's prediction to Harwood was soon verified. One member of the Faculty being ingeniously managed according to the sensitiveness of his temper, the other was to be dealt with on the first fair opportunity. Our worthy President aimed now to be the Government; in humble imitation of dear old President Hicoryface—but not by the same means. Hence he now treated Harwood as a child, and began to represent him as lacking manly judgment; and secretly, like Ulysses, by asking insidious, ensnaring, and doubt engendering questions. At last a noble and ingenuous young man refused to acquiesce in an unnecessary and arbitrary change of arrangement for an exhibition, having previously received a solemn pledge from the President that the change should not be made; and that change being, notwithstanding, now made and,—without the consent of the Faculty. On this, the Government and without any conference with his cabinet, pronounced in public and immediate sentence of dismission on young Heartly. But in this the Faculty neither could nor would concur; since the President had first violated a solemn promise, and then out of revenge wished to inflict summarily a very disproportionate punishment. Hence, Harwood not only refused to acquiesce in a hasty decision, but he in private even earnestly remonstrated with the Doctor; after which Harwood saw Heartly and advised him not to leave Woodville till regularly and legally ordered so to do by the Faculty. Well, this was just what the worthy President desired; and he forthwith, both publicly and privately, denounced usher Harwood as having rebelled against the Government! Nay! as guilty of resistance and ingratitude to his father! And, therefore, Harwood himself must and should leave the College! He declared, and in no measured terms, that it was High Treason in Mr. H. to visit a dismissed student; and then—the President himself, that very day, did visit the same dismissed student, and implore him to remain, saying he never would have suspended him had he not been secretly advised so to do by Harwood himself! This placed our learned men in what is called hot water; and gave us a beautiful illustration of the scriptural sentiment, “how beautiful a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!” “Harwood as yet believed no plan was laid for his over-throw. He thought the Doctor was sorry for his haste, as he both in public and private, professed to be, himself attributing his own rashness and forgetfulness to the disordered state of his nerves; and, as young Heartly had by the Doctor's own decree, been reinstated. Still rumors were afloat that mischief was brewing. Harwood, however, uttered no threat and laid no plans either of attack or defence, but was, as usual, wholly and laboriously busy with the duties of his office. He rarely, in truth, taught less than five hours a day, and oftener more than six! On the contrary, the President true to his favourite rule, that his main duty was “to watch and administer the discipline,” rarely taught more than One Hour a day; and that, sometimes, on horseback! Hence he had abundant leisure to exercise, as he termed it, “parental care and government over all!” The extent and mode of this care and government may be understood by what was afterwards called in the Purchase “the Celebrated Saturday.” On that day Harwood, just before the bell for morning exercises in College, when all the Students and all the Faculty statedly assembled for certain duties, knocked at the door of Little College, and thus, in evident perturbation, addressed Mr. Clarence:— “Clarence! something is brewing, I do believe”— “Why?” “The Doctor has sent for eight or ten Students for a body guard!” “A body guard!—against what?” “I can't imagine: the Manton's were asked—and Bloduplex told them he was in fear of some violence, and asked their aid in protecting him. One brother went; the other declined, and has just now given me the information. What can the man be about?” “Your ruin! But why does so large and able bodied a man ask for a guard, and in addition to his sword-cane? or why does he not apply to the civil authority? Hark! there's the bell —” “Yes! and see!—there, sure enough, is Bloduplex coming not only with his sword-cane, but with at least twelve of the Students around him! What is he driving at?” “Let us go—we shall soon find out?” All now entered the Hall and took their places. The Faculty as usual ascended the Rostrum; where the Government took his customary central seat, between Clarence on his right and Harwood on his left. And then, immediately after Prayer! solemnly and tearfully done by the venerable Pedagogue, that curious personage commenced as follows: “My dear—(mellow voice)—children:—For I must call you children,—I shall not pursue the ordinary course of our duties to day. Instead of that I design to go into a full explanation of the nature and propriety of my government. But as some things, by certain persons, have been said against that government, I beg leave to read to you first, my dear children, a few out of very many papers and testimonials in my possession, to shew you what good judges in other places have thought about me as a President, and what they do yet think.”—(Here the President read his certificates, consisting of official dismissions from sundry ecclesiastical and literary bodies, and several highly laudatory letters and notes from former pupils; and among them a very eulogistic one from the Hon. Stulty Pistolpop, who probably admired the Clergyman's sword-cane-propensities: the effect of all which documents being very happy on the Judges—the Students now seated below as a court of appeals—and making them, for a time, think their Father the Government was really as great and good a man as he was cracked up to be,)—“And so you see my dear children—(voice very tender)—may I not consider myself after all this competent to the government of this college? “But I wish now to say that my system is wholly parental. It is not regulated by printed or written rules and laws, or by the precedents of other colleges, where some people have imbibed arbitrary notions: no, the parental system is that of a father in governing his family—it depends on circumstances—it differs with cases. Some Faculties govern only by rules—rebuking, suspending, expelling, according to the letter. They will take no pains to discriminate; they fix the iron bed and stretch out and lop off till every one is made to fit. Is that right, my DEAR children?—(Several of the Court of Appeals cried out `No! it is not.')—No, indeed, it is not: and persons that thus govern are not fit to govern—are they?”—(No!—from the tribunal below.)—“Deeply do I regret to say that the worthy gentlemen of the Faculty seated on my right and left do not agree with me in these views; for instance, Professor Clarence would have urged me to discipline Mr. Smith according to rule —” Here Mr. C. interrupted— “Doctor Bloduplex I cannot submit to this public insult and injustice —” “Sit down, sir—don't interrupt me, sir!” “I will not sit down till I explain—” “Mr. Clarence you may speak when I am done.” “Well, sir, go on; but do not endeavour to prejudice the minds of these young men against me.” The reverend President went on; and, although he alluded repeatedly to Mr. C. and named many private and confidential matters to his prejudice, that gentleman concluded to let the personage have rope enough to hang himself metaphorically or, otherwise. “Well now, my dear children,—(voice thrilling)—let me imagine a case of parental government, and propose it for your consideration and vote. Suppose a young man, rash and without judgment, was to pursue a rebellious course against a President and Father of a college; and that after every means of private rebuke—yes!—(voice sobby)—after earnest and affectionate entreaty;—(voice breaking)—yes! and suppose after—(sob)—his Father— (sob,sob,)—had even shed tears over him;”—(Here irrepressible sobs and tears for a few moments choked the Government; and many of the judges wept out audibly)— `Suppose the poor rebel's Father should drop on his knees before the ungrateful boy, as I now kneel before you!”— (The Government now dropped on both knees on the floor of the rostrum, in open view of all the students)—“and should weep before him!”—(Here a gush of many tears burst from the wretched man—and weeping was audible, all over the court below)—“And should, with his hands imploringly clasped thus—(action to word)—entreat and beseech that poor rebellious child!—And suppose that child, while his Father was thus on his knees!—thus imploring!—thus weeping!—oh! suppose that child should spit in his Father's face!—ought not that wicked child to be instantly cut off from college and expelled from it forever?” “Yes! yes! he ought, he ought!”—was answered by many, if not all the Students: upon which the Government, still kneeling and with hands in an imploring attitude, cried out with great tenderness and gratitude, thus: “Thank you, my dear children—thank you!”—Then rising from his knees, the miserable Government sank back exhausted with his exercises—(and they were pretty severe)—into his central seat, and hiding his face—(properly enough)—in his hands, he remained thus some moments, sobbing and recovering; perhaps considering the next act. Hence, taking advantage of this pause between the acts, we will enlighten the reader as to some matters. Be it known then, that the rebellious and wicked young dog represented by our Grand Actor, was intended to be Professor Harwood! But none of the tender scene had ever occurred in private; although the Actor wished the audience to think so. On the contrary, when our Professors respectfully yet earnestly had remonstrated against the haste and illegality of Mr. Heartly's dismission by the sole act of the President, Doctor Bloduplex had fallen into an outrageous fit of anger: nay, raising his clenched fist, he had stamped with fury on the floor of his study, and exclaimed—“I care nothing for the Faculty or the Board of Trustees—I will stamp them under my feet!” Some may think the acting described thus far must have injured the actor himself. But, gentle reader, it was done to the very life! Clarence said, he should have been deceived himself, had he not discerned the hoofs and the tail. Had the performer confined himself to his rehearsed parts, and not ventured on a certain extemporaneous playing to be named presently, Harwood and Clarence would have encountered that day a tempest in the outcries of the Students, which must have immediately driven them from their offices—perchance with bloody noses, black eyes and cracked pates! Let a band of generous young men, a little inclined to the mobocratical tendencies of the New Purchase, fully believe all that a venerable and not ill looking clergyman tells them; let them once think that such a man did kneel to his junior, and dehort with tears, and at that moment was basely struck and spit upon by that youth, and there is no act of violence to which such an excited and indignant company may not be led or coaxed. For a while our Professors sat as in a dream! So curiously wonderful was that act in the drama of their lives! Clarence says, he was busy awhile, with a contrast between the oddity on his knees before them, and gentlemen and men like Witherspoon, and Ludlow, and Day, and Nott, and Smith, and Carnahan, and Green! Harwood, the hard hearted rascal! he sat with such a lip and nose of Kentucky scorn!—but soon, as was his habit, when having nothing to do, he began strapping a round-ended blade of an old pocket knife on his boot—said boot tastefully reposing on the knee of the other leg! Reader—that very knife cut the thread of our Actor's intended speech? Happily it was fit for that kind of cutting, but for no other: even if heated it would barely have cut butter! That blade was springless! pointless! edgeless! I have handled it an hundred times. Oh! Bloduplex! had it been a dirk! a Spanish blade! a Mississippi tooth-pick! —what grandeur in that attitude! that look of horror! that piercing thrill of thy outcry! when starting from thy sobs and tears, on catching sight of that funny old knife through thy parted fingers, thou didst thus exclaim and appeal to the Students: “Young gentlemen!—take notice—there is a knife open at my left side!—and I know not for what purpose!” “Doctor Bloduplex!”—cried Clarence—“no harm is threatened—I know that knife—it is entirely worthless— and that is Harwood's habit—I have seen him do it in church!” Here something sticking in the Government's throat, he ejected from his mouth a gob right at Clarence's feet, and then went on: “I have reason, my children, to fear Mr. Harwood; and to protect myself, I asked some of you to guard me to day! It was natural, then, I should dread a knife so near me; but I did not mean to insinuate he had it out for a bad purpose (!)—I only meant to teach him how impolite[45] [45] Spitting at a Professor's feet is what?—In this case Satan correcting Sin. it is to be thus playing with his knife. (!!)” Affairs were now a little disordered: although to the Professors it was plain this thrust at the knife had hurt the Government more than the worst thrust from it could ever have done. Clarence then rose to make his defence before the Court of Appeals. “Young gentlemen,” dixit ille, “we have witnessed a scene both amazing and surprising; hence I shall be easily credited in saying I have no preparation for it —” The President interrupted—“If Mr. Clarence means to insinuate that I had made any preparation, he shall not speak —” “Sir”—rejoined the other—I will speak; and I will repeat that I have no preparation. Further, let the Students notice that surprised and amazed I am, but not in a passion: nay that I am calm and, therefore, competent to make a statement of all facts which, directly and indirectly, the President of the Faculty has seen fit to bring and lay before this school. But why he wishes to involve me is wonderful, as I have already resigned my office, and am only to remain, by contract, for a few months.” Accordingly, and spite of re-repeated and brutal interruptions from the Government, Clarence made his statements and ceased, and then arose Harwood, and commenced as follows: “Gentlemen, Professor Clarence has said he is not angry; but it would be wrong in me not to be angry and indignant too. Doctor Constant Bloduplex, with all the authority of his clerical and official station, has openly and publicly accused me of a design to assassinate him! and seeks thus, as far as he can, to destroy my moral character —” “I did not accuse you, sir!”—said the President. “Not in so many words, Doctor, but you did insinuate, and you intended by your whole manner and your words to insinuate as much.” “I did not.” “You did, sir;—you did! And now, as you have put several things to the vote of the Students to-day, I insist on putting this matter to vote; and if the Students acquit you of evil intention I will yield the point.” “Agreed,” instantly replied the Doctor. Alas! did he not see the tears of the Students had dried away? Or dared he not refuse? Harwood, then, very distinctly stated the question, thus: Vol. II.—14 “All the Students who believe that Doctor Bloduplex did not insinuate that I had out my knife to stab him, affirm that belief by saying—yes.” Not a voice responded! “All the Students who believe that Doctor Bloduplex did insinuate that I had out my knife to stab him, affirm that belief by saying—yes.” “Yes—yes—yes!”—from twenty voices; and from one louder than the rest—“Yes! I'll be d— if he didn't!” “There, sir!”—said now Harwood to the delinquent Government—“You well know you meant your remark for an insinuation; and sir, it was a base insinuation!” To this the President vouchsafed no reply. And he stopped all further preceedings by running down from the Rostrum and retreating to the far side of the Hall, where he declared himself now afraid of Harwood, and said he wished to be surrounded by the Students! And then, after abusing the Professors, he cried out “let all the Students who are in my favour follow me to my house;” when he hurried forth, followed by a few. Had now our two Professors gone home! But “evil communications corrupt good manners;” and so imitating the Parental System, they, forsooth, must have a little talk with the Students!—many of whom remained. They did not say much, indeed; yet Harwood was imprudent enough to say there “Bloduplex is a Liar!” Nay! the same impertinent language both Professors used afterwards, the same day, to the citizens of the village! And for this frightful and outrageous insolence Harwood was shortly after excommunicated from the Communion of the Church! True, Harwood had a dreadful provocation;—but what right had he to twist and squirm about when a Holy and Reverend Man stamped upon him? Why did he not, like an humble worm, crawl back wounded into his hole? True, Harwood offered to bring Clarence, and twenty Students, to prove the truth of the libel; but “no,” said Bishop Bloduplex, who himself presided, and advocated, and judged on the trial, in the inferior court—“no; the greater the truth the greater the libel: and let him thus be taught not to slander and abuse a clergyman!” Ay, and true it was, that Professor Clarence was summoned before our Grand Jury, and on solemn oath declared, that to the best of his knowledge and belief there was not the slightest ground for believing that Mr. Harwood intended on that Saturday to assassinate Doctor Constant Bloduplex! But what right had a mere layman to a character? What right to defend himself, by saying indignantly that the accusation of Doctor B. was malicious and false?—What— “Well, but Mr. Carlton, did not the higher ecclesiastical court take up the case against Bloduplex on Fama Clamosa?—did not the officers and members of his own parish lay the matter before a bench of Bishops?” No! dear reader, no: but consider, he was the only Doctor of Divinity in the whole Purchase! He was too enormous a Big-Bug—and the sting of such is sometimes fatal! “Mr. Carlton, what did the President with the Students that went with him?” Well, several of his body-guard told the author, and gave Mr. Clarence written certificates to the same purport, that “early on Saturday morning the President had sent for and told them expressly he was afraid of Harwood, and wished them to protect him from violence;—that they then believed him, and, indeed, until the knife scene was presented;—that afterwards they went back with the Doctor, but only to hear what else he would say;—that at his house the President treated them with cakes and wine;— that he then read Clarence's confidential letters, and spent a full hour in ridiculing and burlesquing his character, and pronounced him in all respects incompetent to the office of Professor of Languages,” &amp;c. Any more questions, reader? “No, indeed, we have heard enough.” So I had begun to think. Here, then, let us end our celebrated Saturday—a day memorable enough, also, to be the Last of our Seventh Year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUDING SIX MONTHS. CHAPTER LXV. “That such a slave as this should wear a sword!” — Ha! I see the light of a Clearing! a little further, and we are through this Romance of the Forest! Beautiful the fresh green of our opening spring! Glorious the wild flowers and blossoms, exhaling their odours to the air! Grand as ever the dark, solemn, boundless forest! Full of awe, yon swollen water! bearing through the desert wood, on its raging bosom, an hundred branching trees, and, here and there, the shattered fragments of a rude cabin! Hark!—ah! it is the piteous cooing of our wood doves! And hark!—there!—yes, scamper away, you little grey gaffer, and peep from the dense foliage of that lofty sugar-top! I knew it was you squealing your cunning song. Fear not! shady-tail—my rifle is at home—I have no heart to shoot you now! There! cracks the brush!—I see you—leap not away! bounding, timid deer! Stay and graze the early buds and tender twigs of yon thicket— I am no more your foe! Yes! there is a clearing ahead! A short moment more and I leave you, oh! deep and dark ravine, where I have been so often buried in solitude!—and you, oh! beetling cliff, with dizzy brow, frowning over the secret waters so many hundred feet below! And am I so soon to leave you all—and, for ever? Ah! if I revisit the Purchase, you, enchanting trees, will be prostrate!—you, merry squirrel, and timid deer, will have fled!—you, solemn ravine, will be desecrated with wide and beaten roads! Alas! the secret waters will lie open then to the public gaze!—the tall cliff be stripped of its grove!—and the solitary cabin there of Ned Stanley, be supplanted by the odious, pretending, and smirking house of brick and mortar!—alas!— “Mr. Carlton!—Mr. Carlton!!—Mr. Carlton!!!” Sir!—Sir!! “We shall never get out of the woods at this rate.” Thank you, dear reader! I forgot myself—I was away in the spirit amid the apparitions of innocent joys long dead. Let us return, then, to history. Before resuming literary topics, we must say a word of what happened some weeks ago to the firm of Glenville and Carlton: and which dissolved our partnership, and sent Glenville to the Farther West, and Carlton — alas! whither? My partner, in early days, had “put his name to paper;” a security, as he supposed, but making himself liable as a partner. Notes were given to pay for produce: and this was loaded and floated to Orleans, and there sold at a fair profit. But, by a singular negligence, the gentleman entrusted with the boats, and pork, corn, lard, tallow, and hoop-poles, never came back with the money! And hence the merchants failing, the holders of their notes got nothing for their paper! For many long years, this paper lay quiet and slumbering—till a lawyer suddenly appeared in the woods—and the repose of the notes was broken. And so was that of Glenville! The holders were now taught for “a consideration,” how to come upon the security— especially as he, after a long and doubtful struggle, had got above the waves, and was swimming in comparative comfort. The security was, therefore, advised very unexpectedly of his insecurity: and, in the next moment, stripped of all his hard earned possessions, he was soused naked into that very figurative and deeply poetical sea—a Sea of Troubles! Now, folks intimately connected with others, rarely take that metaphorical plunge, without ducking their associates: hence, down went Mr. Carlton into the deep waters, from which emerging for a sniff of air, he saw most of his external good things swept away by the torrent! Mr. Carlton's work, therefore, for the six months under consideration, was that most vexatious and profitless kind of twisting called winding-up. Suppose me, then, hard at work, turning the windlass or some other figured crank of the Wind-up-business, while we go on to wind-up also the story of the College: and then Clarence, and the rest of us, like other phantasms of our drama, disappear—perhaps, for ever! After the Saturday, our Literati continued their labours, —the Government minding the discipline,—the Professors, the teaching. Except some official intercourse, all other was at an end: for the Professors were for keeping out of harm's way, and not only avoided all sayings and doings in company of the President, but even looking at or to wards him out of the tail of an eye. Generally, the students remained neutral: but the young gentlemen belonging to the governmental party, did very good service as partisans. Among other things, they, one dark night, girdled all Clarence's flourishing and ornamental trees set out by him years before, around little College; —they cut off his beautiful woodbines, twining up frames around his doors and windows—and at other times, they destroyed his garden fence, and admitted or turned a herd of swine into the too exuberant fruits and vegetables—not to name other civilized feats unknown before to Hoosier young men. Harwood did not share these compliments—not because less respected—but more feared. Kind and gentle as a great mastiff, still he was not all patience: and, once aroused, he would not have scrupled to shake well in his staunch jaws, the sneaking whelps and genteel curs, so annoying to his clerical neighbour. Well, indeed, might Bloduplex have been in awe of that Kentucky spirit, had it ever dreamed of doing him harm! True, Bloduplex always, now, went armed—his sword sheathed in a cane!— maliciously pretending that Harwood intended to whip him!—poor defence! had the Professor once seriously undertaken to give him, what he so richly deserved—a hiding! And yet, accidentally, these belligerents once met, and Harwood was upset. First, however, be it remembered, our side-walk, for a mile, was paved with wood, not chemically, but mechanically: a line of hewed logs ran from the Colleges to the centre of Woodville. This pave was used in miry times—until anybody received two severe falls, after which he stuck to the mud-way of the vulgar road. Now, it was the custom, when two peaceful Christians were about to meet, for the more active to hasten to the end of his log, and, stepping aside to an adjacent block or stone, there remain till the superior, or lady, had passed. Well, one Sabbath morning, Harwood was going full tilt up town, to visit a sick relative, and, being on the log-way, he discerned advancing from the opposite direction, Doctor Bloduplex. Accordingly, he hurried on to reach, by the laws of our etiquette, the step-out place—but, alas! as he stepped aside, the Doctor accidentally quickening his pace, suddenly presented his shoulder, and, with all his weight of person and character, tumbled the Professor off his feet, and had the honour of making his new hat fly ten feet away into the mud! That is Harwood's tale. Here, however, is the Governmental version triumphantly given to our Board of Trustees, I being present:— “I had been, Mr. Chairman,” said he to Doctor Sylvan, our President,—“I had been up town, to visit a sick parishioner, on Sabbath morning, and was on my return, in order to prepare for the sacred duties of the pulpit, when I saw coming to meet me, in a threatening attitude, Mr. Harwood. At a glance, I saw he was determined not to yield me the log: and I then resolved so to chastise his want of respect for my age, character, and station, as for ever to make him remember the lesson. I have been accused of fearing that young man; but, Mr. Chairman, independent of this cane, in which I carry a sword,”—(and, at the word, this Christian Doctor did, in presence of our whole Board, draw that sword, and, with a real Falstaff gravity and swell)—“independent, I say, of this sword,”—(driven back with inimitable grandeur,)—“I well knew, in case of a rencontre, I should easily knock him off the log! because, the day before, I had been weighed in Mr. Retail's patent scales, and my weight was exactly One Hundred and Ninety Pounds! and, of course, when we came together, he found himself and his hat where he informs you!!” “Is that true, Mr. Carlton!?” Yes, reader, it is: and I'll take my “affidavy on it.” “What meeting of your Board, was this?” A called meeting, called by the Government, with a view to have his rebellious Professors instantly expelled. It was held about the middle of our final six months: but it would make too long a book to do more than run over a few outlines. After the exchange of papers, notes, and other diplomatics, the Board, the Government, and Faculty, convened; when Bloduplex began—continued—ay, and held on even ahead, for two long summer days, “from rise of morn to set of sun;” and then ended, because fully blown out! But after that, for other speech or reply there was no time, and, happily, no necessity. As usual, the President read his certificates—gave his religious experience, and miraculous conversion from infidelity—told of his sainted mother looking down on him— and sobbed, and finally roared right out, like a bull-calf foreibly held back from the cow! From this recovering, he told us how Harwood and Clarence had even ridiculed that experience! and expressed suspicion about those tears, when he had indiscreetly given them the same history in private! He then went over his own whole life and character—did the same for Harwood, and ditto for Clarence: in all which he showed the pre-eminence of his mnemonic-system, by detailing to us every word, joke, pleasantry, tea-drinking, walk in the woods, rash-saying, silly-word, indignant-exclamation, &amp;c. &amp;c.—and even very many improper things that “should have been” said and done by our Professors,—but which never had been! He tried his hand at irony and sarcasm, comparing himself to Dr. Johnson, and Clarence to Boswell! He ridiculed Clarence for being a “charity scholar:” because, at Princeton, he had paid nothing for his Theological education! He then acted the bottle story—which, however, cannot be fully represented without a diagram: but he used one hand for a bottle, and the fore-finger of the other as corkscrew; and then, holding the bottle-and-corked-fist under an Honourable Trustee's nose, he suddenly, with corkscrew-finger jerked out the cork, and let out the whole essence, in that remarkable sentence, “Billy! you're a mighty little man!” And “this,” added the facetious Government—“this is what I did for the students at my house on the Saturday named, and to illustrate Professor Clarence's character; as I did not choose to employ a sledge-hammer to kill a fly!” It was now the Government, and with great complacency, spoke and acted the celebrated a posteriori mentioned in this work, and so often afterwards repeated by him. But, at length, this Great Engine ceased its emissions of steam; and we aroused to hear Clarence's reply, and yet with looks of peevishness, as dreading another long, abusive, windy tempest of words. Oh! the delicious refreshing of his more than laconic reply—thus:— “Mr. Chairman, and Gentlemen of the Board,—I have very much I could say—but I shall make no reply!” This answer will be better appreciated from the following dialogue between Dr. Sylvan and Mr. Clarence, directly after our adjournment:— Dr. S. “Never, sir, did you do a happier thing: you effected more for yourself than by a thousand speeches.” Mr. C. “You saw me, Dr. Sylvan, for six hours the first day, taking notes, that I might reply to the innumerable slanders and falsehoods with which I was assailed: but, then occurred this thought, amid that torrent of ribaldry, viz:—`If these Trustees are gentlemen, they need not my reply;—if they are not gentlemen, I need not make a reply.' And then, sir, you saw me crumble up my notes, and put them into my pocket: and I shall hand them over to Robert Carlton.” Our called meeting, however, utterly declined expelling the Professors; and that, notwithstanding the President repeatedly said in his oration, that he would resign if Mr. Harwood was permitted to remain! We recommended, indeed, if, possible, an amicable private adjustment, and referred the whole matter to the new Board of Trustees, that were to meet in the Fall: a very cowardly behaviour, since we all privately felt and acknowledged that President Bloduplex certainly deserved to be dismissed, whatever the Professors may have merited. To Clarence, that resolution was nothing: he had resigned; and, for weeks past, had been preparing, as all the town knew, to leave the Purchase! The attack on him now, was to have the existing contract annulled; which would deprive him, it was supposed, of the residue of his salary; cripple his resources; blacken his character; and render his probable story of events less impressive! But Bloduplex overlooked Mr. Clarence's old crony, Robert Carlton, Esq.: and he saw not then and there “a chiel takin notes!” Beside, for ever to prevent any evil surmises in regard to Professor Clarence, our Board, (and at the instance of Mr. Carlton,) not only unanimously voted the full and entire acquittal of Clarence, but each and every one of them did personally and individually over and above the official signatures, add his own name to my friend's honourable and laudatory dismissal! Ay, and this man, after all that ingenuity and malice (and of practised cunning,) could invent, and colour, and say of him, in a speech of two summer days!—and after making no defence, nor an appeal to passion or prejudice, was acquitted!—and, not only acquitted, but thanked and praised!—and by his very Judges!! “What do you think of that, Master Ford?” Harwood now stood alone: and Polyphemus having “a sorter” devoured one victim, took additional steps to eat the other. Several of our Board had, indeed, agreed with me in thinking and saying that “Doctor Bloduplex had behaved badly and even shamefully;” yet I warned Harwood that the New Board in the Fall, who “knew not Joseph and his brethren,” would go, not according to justice and truth, but according to their ideas of interest and policy: because, too, some Trustees had told me that “they feared to dismiss Bloduplex, lest his influence might injure Woodville!—that after such a quarrel, it would be difficult to obtain immediately another President—and that the College must not be destitute of such, Mr. Clarence, the maker of the Institution, being gone too!” It was now, Bloduplex, Lord Bishop of the parish church, summoned Harwood before his little ecclesiastical star-chamber, and had him excommunicated, for calling his Reverence a Liar: intending said excommunication to act like an interdict on a kingdom, and prejudice his antagonist's cause before the New Board of Trustees to meet in the Fall! At this ecclesiastical Inquisition, Bloduplex himself sat as chief Inquisitor!—he made the charges!— he excluded the defensive testimony and all pleas of mitigation—all entreaties to carry the whole at once to a higher court—he directed the officials—pronounced the sentence —inflicted the torture! As Nero to the primitive Christians, so did Bloduplex to Harwood—he dressed him in a wild beast's skin, and then hissed dogs on him! Ay, he was cruelly hunted like a brute! And after in vain spending his hard earned dollars in seeking redress, he in an excusable moment of bitter indignation left at last that, upon the whole, Best of Religious Denominations! But let that Harwood, if he yet live, know there is One Bold enough to raise a voice against the vile Injustice of the Past—one that knows—and says Harwood was always badly, and sometimes basely and wickedly used! And let him know, too, that under better auspices, and but for some mere accidents, the Immense Majority of the Denomination he has left would have done him justice on his Cruel and Unrelenting Foe! Reader! here falls the curtain! And we stand before it, not to announce a new Drama—but our Farewell:—We bid you adieu in the next and—last chapter. CHAPTER LXVI. “Nay then farewell! I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness: And from that full meridian of my glory I haste now to my setting: I shall fall Like a bright exhalation in the evening, And no man see me more.” About the middle of October, a small Christian chapel was, one night, filled to overflowing; and deeply impressive was the sadness and solemn hush of the congregation! They were listening to the farewell address of Charles Clarence! while the voice of the wind moaning in the dying woods around, came upon our hearing in fitful gusts like passionate gushings of lamentation for the fading away of their glories! Our injured and persecuted friend concluded thus:— EXTRACT. “— — But I must cease, and that with no expectation that I shall ever more preach to you; or you ever again listen to me. This is sufficiently solemn and mournful; yet other things exist here to deepen now my sorrows. For some years this has been my home—nay, why conceal it? I had once cherished the hope it was to be my home for years to come! It was in my heart to live and die with you! I came to be a Western Man—but God forbade it. I have shared your prosperity and adversity; and in your hopes and fears, your joys and griefs. We have interchanged visits of mutual good-will; we have worshipped in the same temples; we have solaced each other in afflictions! We have met at the same house of feasting,—alas! oftener at the same house of mourning! Yes!—my children lie together, in their little graves, amidst the graves of your children—that moaning wind is stirring now the leaves over them!—dust of mine is mingling with yours! * * * Can these and other ties be so unexpectedly sundered without pain?—without emotion? But the hour is come—we part! Come, fellow citizens and Christian friends, let us mutually forgive one another. If I have aught against the misled I have forgiven it; if any have aught against me, I pray such forgive me! Kindly do I thank many for past kindness, and more especially for the healing of their balm-like sympathy: and now let us say, not in indifference, much less in anger, but in manly, hearty good-will—Farewell!” In the morning his house was tenantless;—Clarence had gone very early away with his family—and Woodville with its pleasures and pains was to him as all other dreams of this life—past! Soon after, the fragments of my shattered fortunes being collected, we too were ready to bid adieu to our home:— home! did I say? Yes; had we not graves there? Alas! we had them elsewhere too!— It was a rainy morning; but, notwithstanding, our little wagon and horses were at the door. All had been arranged and prepared for this morning, and all farewells, as we thought, had been spoken; and why should rain delay those that had endured so many storms? Emily Glenville was to go and share our fortunes—but Aunt Kitty—poor Aunt Kitty was to stay; for we were wandering forth we knew not whither, and she in her old age must remain till we found a resting-place. Home we expected to find no more —(nor have we ever)—and we had then the desolate hearts of pilgrims—as now and often since! Farewell!—dearest Aunt Kitty!—ah! break not our hearts by that convulsive sobbing!—Farewell! * * * * —and then we were all in our wagon—but just as we moved, a well-known, a rough, yet softened voice in a tone of melancholy reproach sounded at our side: “Bust my rifle! Mr. Carltin, you ain't a puttin off without biddin me and Domore good bye!?” “My honest old friends! no, never!—but I could not find you yesterday when we went round bidding all the citizens good bye—” “Well, we was out arter deer, for, says I to Domore, Domore, says I, lets git a leg or two for Mrs. Carltin afore they goes—and we've fetch'd 'em along in this here bag— if you kin find room for 'em in this here waggin.” “Thank you, my kind friends, with all our very hearts! —I do wish we could make you some return—we should be so glad to be remembered when we are away—” “Bust my rifle—if I ever forgit you—and Domore wont nither—” “No, indeed, Mr. Carltin—and if you chance to come our way like, Domore's cabin will be open as in old times—” “Yes!—Mr. Carltin—and me and Domore and you'll have some more shots with the rifle—good bye, Mr. Carltin —God bless you—good bye!” “Good bye, my friends!—I have no home now—but cabin or brick house, wherever you find us—I say to you and all other frank-hearted honest woodsmen, as the old General said to you—`you will never find the string pulled in!”' Here I started my horses; and then the last we ever heard of Woodville was something very like:—“Poor Carltin!—God bless him—poor feller!—he's most powerful sorry—and don't like to go back to the big-bugs!” And then through the uproar of the increasing storm came the voice of the two hunters united in a loud, cordial, solemn, last Farewell! Many years after this, on the pinnacle of the Great Cove Mountain of the Alleghanies, and leaning against a tree, stood a solitary traveller, who, after contemplating for some minutes the setting sun, thus broke forth into a soliloquy: “Yes! O Sun! thou art unchanged!—melting away to rest amid the same gorgeous clouds, piled on those distant mountains! I remember thee rising in the brilliancy of that Spring morning! Here Clarence stood and looked towards the Elysium of that Far West—and she was in his thoughts! There is the rock where Brown, and Wilmar, and Smith rested a moment! — Sad remembrances! —bitter emotions! O! Sun! as glorious thou as ever! those sumptuous curtains of woven cloud around thy pavilion as matchless!—I am changed—alas! how changed! “Far West!—that name has power to heave the bosom with sighs—but it can call up no more forever the illusions of the dreamy days! I know what is in thee, land of the setting Sun! “A world of shadows is coming over yon vallies— darker ones are on my soul! That Spring Morning! The comrades of that day—where? The scenes!—the sufferings!—the disappointments!—in that far away forest land! Graves of my dead!—why need I care to weep, where there are none to mock. * * * * * * “World of Spirits!—around and near me! No dreams —no shadows there! Sun, farewell!—thy last rays are falling across those graves in that leaf-covered resting place! But they shall see thee fall, to rise and set no more! Home!—I have none now:—but there is a home! “Awake! from this dreamy life!

      <field name="fulltext">BOOKS IN THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS OF Human Knowledge, PUBLISHED BY D. APPLETON &amp; CO., NEW-YORK, AND GEORGE S. APPLETON, PHILADELPHIA. HISTORY OF THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND. By Gilbert Burnet, D.D., late Bishop of Salisbury. With a Collection of Records, and a copious Index, revised and corrected, with additional Notes and a Preface, by the Rev. E. Nares, D.D. Illustrated with a Frontispiece and twenty-three Portraits on steel. Forming four elegant 8vo. vols. of near 600 pages each. $8 00. To the student either of civil or religious history no epoch can be of more importance than that of the Reformation in England. It signalized the overthrow, in one of its strongest holds, of the Roman power, and gave an impulse to the human mind, the full results of which are even now but partly realized. Almost all freedom of inquiry—all foleration in matters of religion, had its birth-hour then; and without a familiar acquaintance with all its principal events, but little progress can be made in understanding the nature and ultimate tendencies of the revolution then effected. The History of Bishop Burnet is one of the most celebrated and by far the most frequently quoted of any that has been written of this great event. Upon the original publication of the first volume, it was received in Great Britain with the loudest and most extravagant encomiums. The author received the thanks of both Houses of Parliament, and was requested by them to continue the work. In continuing it he had the assistance of the most learned and eminent divines of his time; and he confesses his indebtedness for important aid to Lloyd, Tillotson and Stillingfleet, three of the greatest of England's Bishops. “I know,” says he, in his Preface to the second volume, “that nothing can more effectually recommend this work, than to say that it passed with their hearty approbation, after they had examined it with that care which their great zeal for the cause concerned in it, and their goodness to the author and freedom with him, obliged them to use.” The present edition of this great work has been edited with laborious care by Dr. Nares, who professes to have corrected important errors into which the author fell, and to have made such improvements in the order of the work as will render it far more useful to the reader or historical student. Preliminary explanations, full and sufficient to the clear understanding of the author, are given, and marginal references are made throughout the book, so as greatly to facilitate and render accurate its consultation. The whole is published in four large octavo volumes of six hundred pages in each—printed upon heavy paper in large and clear type. It contains portraits of twenty-four of the most celebrated characters of the Reformation, and is issued in a very neat style. It will of course find a place in every theologian's library—and will, by no means, we trust, be confined to that comparatively limited sphere. BURNET ON THE XXXIX. ARTICLES. An Exposition of the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. By Gilbert Burnet, D.D., late Bishop of Salisbury. With an Appendix, containing the Augsburg Confession—Creed of Pope Pius IV., &amp;c. Revised and corrected, with copious Notes and additional References, by the Rev. James R. Page, A. M., of Queen's College, Cambridge., In one handsome 8vo. volume. $2 00. “No Churchman, no Theologian, can stand in need of information as to the character or value of Bishop Burnet's Exposition, which long since took its fitting place as one of the acknowledged and admired standards of the Church. It is only needful that we speak of the labours of the editor of the present edition, and these appear to blend a fitting modesty with eminent industry and judgment. Thus, while Mr. Page has carefully verified, and in many instances corrected and enlarged the references to the Fathers, Councils and other authorities, and greatly multiplied the Scripture citations —for the Bishop seems in many cases to have forgotten that his readers would not all be as familiar with the Sacred Text as himself, and might not as readily find a passage even when they knew it existed—he (Mr. P.) has scrupulously left the text untouched, and added whatever illustrative matter he has been able to gather in the form of Notes and an Appendix. The documents collected in the latter are of great and abiding value.” PEARSON ON THE CREED. An Exposition of the Creed. By John Pearson, D.D., late Bishop of Chester. With an Appendix, containing the Principal Greek and Latin Creeds. Revised and corrected by the Rev. W. S. Dobson, M.A., Peterhouse, Cambridge. In one handsome 8vo. volume. $2 00. The following may be stated as the adventages of this edition over all others. First—Great care has been taken to correct the numerous errors in the references to the texts of Scripture which had crept in by reason of the repeated editions through which this admirable work has passed; and many references, as will be seen on turning to the Index of Texts, have been added. Secondly—The Quotations in the Notes have been almost universally identified and the references to them adjoined. Lastly—The Principal Symbola or Creeds, of which the particular Articles have been cited by the author, have been annexed; and wherever the original writers have given the Symbola in a scattered and disjointed manner, the detached parts have been brought into a successive and connected point of view. These have been added in chronological order in the form of an Appendix—Vide Editor. Magee on Atonement and Sacrifice. Discourses and Dissertations on the Scriptural Doctrines of Atonement and Sacrifice, and on the Principal Arguments advanced, and the Mode of Reasoning employed by the Opponents of those Doctrines, as held by the Established Church. By the late most Rev. Wm. M'Gee, D.D., Archbishop of Dublin. Two vols. royal 8vo. beautifully printed. $5 00. “This is one of the ablest critical and polemical works of modern times. Archbishop Magee is truly a maleus hereticolum. He is an excellent scholar, an acute reasoner, and is possessed of a most extensive acquaintance with the wide field of argument to which his volumes are devoted—the profound Biblical information on a variety of topics which the Archbishop brings forward, must endear his name to all lovers of Christianity.” —Orme. PALMER'S TREATISE ON THE CHURCH. A Treatise on the Church of Christ. Designed chiefly for the use of Students in Theology. By the Rev. William Palmer, M.A., of Worcester College, Oxford. Edited, with Notes, by the Right Rev. W. R. Whittingham, D.D., Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Maryland. Two vols. 8vo. handsomely printed on fine paper. $5 00. “The treatise of Mr. Palmer is the best exposition and vindication of Church Principles that we have ever read; excelling contemporaneous treatises in depth of learning and solidity of fudgment, as much as it excels older treatises on the like subjects, in adaptation to the wants and habits of the age. Of its influence in England, where it has passed through two editions, we have not the means to form an opinion; but we believe that in this country it has already, even before its reprint, done more to restore the sound tone of Catholic principles and feeling than any other one work of the age. The author's learning and powers of combination and arrangement. great as they obviously are, are less remarkable than the sterling good sense, the vigorous and solid judgment, which is everywhere manifest in the tres-tase, and confers on it its distinctive excellence. The style of the author is distinguished for dignity and masculine energy, while his tone is everywhere natural; on proper occasions, reverential; and always, so far as we remember, sufficiently conciliatory. “To our clergy and intelligent laity, who desire to see the Church justly discriminated from Romanists on the one hand, and dissenting denominations on the other, we earnestly command Palmer's Treatise on the Church.” —N. Y. Churchman PAROCHIAL SERMONS, BY JOIN HENRY NEWMAN, B.D., Fellow of the Oriel Collego and Vicar of St. Mary the Virgin's, Oxford. The six volumes of the London edition complete in two elegant 8vo. volumes of upwards of 600 pages each. $5 00. Mr. Newman's Sermons have probably attained a higher character than any others ever published in this country. The following recommendatory letter (is one of the many) received by the publishers during their progress through the press. From she Bishop of North Carolina. Raleigh, Nov. 98, 1842. Your letter aunouncing your intention to republish the Parochial Sermons of the Rev. John Henry Newman, B.D., Oxford, has given me sincere pleasure. In complying with your request for my opinion of them, I do not hesitate to say,—after a constant use of them in my closet, and an observation of their effect upon some of my friends, for the last six years,—that they are among the very best practical sermons in the English language; that while they are free from those extravagances of opinion usually ascribed to the author of the 90th Tract, they assert in the strongest manner the true doctrines of the Reformation in England, and enforce with peculiar solemnity and effect that holiness of life, with the means thereto, so characteristic of the Fathers of that trying age. With high respect and esteem, your friend and servant, L. S. IVES. HARE'S PAROCHIAL SERMONS. Sermons to a Country Congregation. By Augustus William Hare, A.M., late Fellow of New College, and Rector of Alton Barnes. One volume, royal 8vo. $2 25. “Any one who can be pleased with delicacy of thought expressed in the most simple language—any one who can feel the charm of finding practical duties elucidated and enforced by apt and varied illustrations—will be delighted with this volume, which presents us with the workings of a pious and highly gifted mind.” —Quar. Review. THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST; Or, Hints respecting the Principles, Constitution, and Ordinances of the Catholic Church. By Frederick Denison Maurice. M.A. Chaplain of Guy's Hospital, Professor of English Literature and History, King's College, London. In one elegant octavo volume of 600 pages, uniform in style with Newman's Sermons, Palmer on the Church, &amp;c. $2 50. “Mr. Maurice's work is eminently fitted to engage the attention and meet the wants of all interested in the several movements that are now taking place in the religions community; is takes up the pretensions generally of the several Protestant denominations and of the Romanists, so as to commend itself in the growing interest in the controversy between the latter and their opponents. The political portion of the work contains much that is attractive to a thoughtful man, of any or of no religions persuasion, in reference to the existing and possible future state of our country.” A MANUAL FOR COMMUNICANTS; Or the Order for Administering the Holy Communion; conveniently arranged with Meditations and Prayers from Old English Divines, being the Eucharistica of Samuel Wilberforce, M.A., Archdeacon of Surry, (adapted to the American service.) Convenient size for the pocket 37½ conts—gil edges 50 cents. “These meditations, prayers, and expositions, are given in the very words of the illustrious divines, martyrs, confessors, and doctors of the Church; and they form altogether such a body of instructive matter as is nowhere else to be found in the same compass. Though collected from various authors, the whole is pervaded by a unity of spirit and purpose, and we most earnestly commend the work as better fitted than any other which we know, to subserve the ends of sound edification and fervent and substanial devotion-The American reprint has been edited by a deacon of great promise in the Church, and is appropriately dedicated to the Bishop of this diocese.” —Churchman. OGILBY ON LAY - BAPTISM: An Outline on the Argument against the Validity of Lay-Baptism. By the Rev. John D., Ogilby, A.M., Professor of Ecclesiastical History. One volume 12mo., 75 cents. “We have been favoured with a copy of the above work, and lose no time in announcing its publication. From a cursory inspection of it, we take it to be a thorough, fearless, and very able discussion of the subject which it proposes. aming less to excite inquiry, than to satisfy, by learned and ingenious argument, inquiries already excited.” —Churchman. THE PRIMITIVE DOCTRINE OF ELECTION: Or, an Historical Inquiry into the Ideality and Causation of Scriptural Election, as received and maintained in the Primitive Church of Christ. By George Stanley Faber, B.D., author of “Difficulties of Romanism,” “Difficulties of Infidelity,” &amp;c. Complete in one volume octavo. $1 75. “Mr. Faber verifies his opinion by demonstration. We cannot pay a higher respect to his work than by recommeading it to all.” —Church of England Quarterly Review. CHURCHMAN'S LIBRARY.

On the Relation between the Holy Scriptures and some parts of Geological Science. By John Pye Smith, D.D., author of the “Scripture Testimony of the Messiah,” &amp;c. &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1 25. “The volume consists of eight lectures, to which are appended seventy pages of supplementary notes. The first lecture is introductory; the second is scientifically descriptive of the principal topics of geological science; the third includes a research into the creation of our globe; the fourth and fifth lectures comprise an examination of the deluge; the sixth discusses the apparent dissonance between the decisions of geologists, and the hitherto received interpretation of Scripture, with an additional exposition of the diluvial theory; the seventh is devoted to illustration of the method to interpret the Scriptures, so that they may harmonize with the discoveries of geology; the eighth is the peroration of the whole disquisition. WORKS BY THE REV. DR. SPRAGUE. TRUE AND FALSE RELIGION. Lectures illustrating the Contrast between True Christianity and various other systems. By William B. Sprague, D.D. 1 vol. 12mo. $1 00.

Fourth edition, revised and enlarged. 1 vol. 12mo. 75 cents. LECTURES TO YOUNG PEOPLE. By W. B. Sprague, D.D. With an Introductory Address. By Samuel Miller, D.D. Fourth edition. 1 vol. 12mo. 87½ cents. The writings of Dr. Sprague are too well known, and too highly estimated by the Christian community generally, to require any other encomium than is furnished by their own merits; for this reason it is thought unnecessary to subjoin the favourable testimonies borne to their utility and excellence by the whole circle of the periodical press of this country, and the fact, that they have each passed through several editions in England, sufficiently attests the estimation in which they are held abroad. SPIRITUAL CHRISTIANITY. Lectures on Spiritual Christianity. By Isaac Taylor, author of “Spiritual Despotism,” &amp;c. &amp;c. 1 vol 12mo. 75 cents. “This work is the production of one of the most gifted and accomplished minds of the present age. If some of his former productions may have been thought characterized by too much metaphysical abstraction, and in some instances, by speculations of doubtful importance the present volume is, we think, in no degree liable to this objection. It is indeed distinguished for deep thought and accurate discrimination: and whoever would read it to advantage, must task his faculties in a much higher degree, than in reading ordinary books: and yet it contains nothing which an ordinary degree of intelligence and application may not readily comprehend. The view which it gives of Christianity, both as a system of truth and a system of duty, is in the highest degree instructive; and its tendencies are not less to quicken the intellectual faculties, than to direct and elevate the moral sensibilities. We have no doubt that it will be read with great interest by those who read to find materials for thought, and that it is destined to exert a most important influence, especially on the more intellectual classes in the advancement of the interests of truth and piety.” —Albany Evening Journal.

The Maternal Series of the above popular Library is now ready, entitled, THE HANNAHS; or Maternal Influence of Sons. By Robert Philip. 1 vol. 18mo. 50 cts. “The author of this work is known to the public as one of the most prolific writers of the day, and scarcely any writer in the department which he occupies, has acquired so extensive and well-merited a popularity. The present volume, as its title denotes, is devoted to an illustration of the influence of mothers on their sons; and the subject is treated with the same originality and beauty which characterize the author's other works. It will be found to be a most delightful and useful companion in the nursery, and its influence can hardly fail to be felt; first, in quickening the sense of responsibility on the part of mothers; and next, in forming the character of the rising generation to a higher standard of intelligence and virtue.” Evangelist. GEMS FROM TRAVELLERS. Illustrative of various passages in the Holy Scripture, with nearly one hundred Engravings. Among the authorities quoted will be found the following distinguished names: Harmer, Laborde, Lane, Madden, Clarke, Pococke, Chandler, Malcom, Hartley, Russel, Jowitt, Carne, Shaw, Morier, Neibuhr, Bruce, Calmet, H. Blunt, Belzoni, Lord Lindsay, &amp;c. &amp;c. 1 vol. 12mo. $1 00. “The Holy Scriptures contain many passages full of importance and beauty, but not generally understood, because they contain allusion to manners and customs, familiar indeed to those to whom they were originally addressed, but imperfectly known to us. In order to obviate this difficulty, this volume is now presented to the public, consisting of extracts from the narratives of travellers who have recorded the customs of the oriental nations, from whom we learn that some usages were retained among them to this day, such as existed at the times when the Scriptures were written, and that these names are in many instances little changed since the patriarchal times. The complier of this volume trusts that it may be the means, under God's providence, of leading unlearned readers to a more general acquintance with Eastern customs, and assist them to a clearer perception of the propriety and beauty of the illustrations so often drawn from them in the Bible. Works by the Rev. John Angell James. THE TRUE CHRISTIAN. By the Rev. John Angell James. With an Introduction by the Rev. Wm. Adams. 1 vol. 18mo $0 50. “We opine that the publishers of this volume made an accurate calculation when they labelled these ` `Addresses'—stereotyped; for they are among the choice effusions which already have so highly benefited Christian society from the noble heart and richly-endowed mind of Mr. James. They are ministerial counsels to the members of his congregation, and are offered as monthly epistles for a year, being twelve in number, and are thus entitled: `Increased Holiness of the Church; Spirituality of Mind: Heavenly Mindedness; Assurance of Hope; Practical Religion seen in every thing: A Profitable Sabbath; Christian Obligations; Life of Faith; Influence of elder Christians; Spirit of Prayer; Private Prayer, and Self-Examination.' ” —Christian Intelligencer. THE YOUNG MAN FROM HOME. In a series of Letters, especially directed for the Moral Advancement of Youth. By the Rev. John Angell James. Tenth edition. 1 vol. 18mo. 37½ cts. “This work, from the able and prolific pen of Mr. James, is not inferior, we think, to any of its predecessors. It contemplates a young man at the most critical period of life, and meets him at every point as a guide in the paths of virtue, as a guard from the contagious influence of vice.” —Albany Advertiser. THE CHRISTIAN PROFESSOR, Addressed in a series of Counsels and Cautions to the Members of Christian Churches. By the Rev. John Angell James. 1 vol. 18mo. 62½ cents. “The author remarks in this excellent volume: `When I look into the New Testament and read what a Christian should be, and then look into the Church of God, and see what Christians are, I am painfully affected by observing the dissimilarity, and in my jealousy for the honour of the Christian profession, have made this effrot, perhaps a feeble one, and certainly an anxious one, to remove its blemishes, to restore its impaired beauty, and thus raise its reputation.' ” THE ANXIOUS ENQUIRER AFTER SALVATION Directed and Encouraged. By the Rev. John Angell James. 1 vol. 18mo. 37½ cents. Twenty thousand copies of this excellent little volume have already been sold, which fully attests the high estimation the work has attained with the religious community. HAPPINESS, ITS NATURE AND SOURCES. By the Rev. J. A. James. 1 vol. 32mo. 25 cents. “This is written in the excellent author's best vein. He has, with a searching fidelity, exposed the various unsatisfying expedients by which the natural heart seeks to attain the great end and aim of all—happiness, and with powerful and touching exhortations directed it to the never-failing source of all good.”—Evangelist. THE WIDOW DIRECTED To the Widow's God. By the Rev. John A. James. 1 vol. 18mo. 37½ cents. “The book is worthy to be read by others besides the class for which it is especially designed; and we doubt not that it destined to come as a friendly visitor to many a house of mourning, and as a healing balm to many a wounded heart.” —N. Y. Observer. CRUDEN'S CONCORDANCE. Containing all the Words to be found in the large Work relating to the New Testament. 1 vol. 18mo. 50 cents. THE POLYMICRIAN NEW TESTAMENT.

Two elegantly printed volumes, 400 pages each, 16mo., with beautiful frontispieces. $1 75. This is the only complete American edition. Morality never found in genius a more devoted advocate than Cowper, nor has moral wisdom, in its plain and severe precepts, been ever more successfully combined with the delicate spirit of poetry, than in his works. He was endowed with all the powers which a poet could want who was to be the moralist of the world—the reprover, but not the satirist, of men—the teacher of simple truths, which were to be rendered gracious without endangering their simplicity.

Beautifully illustrated. 1 vol. 16mo. $1 25. The Latin and Italian Poems are included in this edition.

He describes that which is most easily and generally understood with more vivacity and effect than any other writer. His style is clear, flowing and transparent; his sentiments, of which his style is an easy and natural me dium, are common to him with his readers.” —Hazlitt.

All the leading journals have spoken in the most unqualified praise of this work. The following is from the Boston Traveller: “As a chaste, condensed, faithful, and accurate memoir of the Great Captain, it is worthy of much attention. The author has mainly drawn the necessary facts of his history from the letters, speeches, manifestoes, bulletins, and other state papers of Napoleon, and has given a considerable number of these in his text. “The work is superior to the long verbose productions of Scott and Bourrienne—not in style alone, but in truth—being written to please neither Charles X. nor the English aristocracy—but for the cause of freedom. It has advantages over every other memoir extant.” THE BOOK OF THE NAVY; Comprising a General History of the American Marine, and particular Accounts of all the most Celebrated Naval Battles, from the Declaration of Independence to the present time, compiled from the best authorities.
