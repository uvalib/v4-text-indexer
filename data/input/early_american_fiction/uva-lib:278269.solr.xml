      <field name="fulltext">DEDICATION. DEAR ——, The wide water is between us, dear; but, if this volume should ever fall in your way, and stranger things have happened, already, during our mysterious acquaintance, you will know the author, the moment that you touch the paper, by the flutter at your heart. Would that I might be near enough to you, for a moment of admonition! I would bid you beware of opening any new work in the presence of another; otherwise, when you least expect it, your agitation might betray a secret, that is unknown to every other living creature. Have you forgotten what I told you? Have you forgotten my promise? How have I kept it? “Nothing is impossible to them that love, and love innocently.” Their spirits will hold communion together—sleeping or waking;—and who shall participate therein? Nobody—no living creature—not even the angels in heaven;—none but Him, that pitich his children. Farewell, dear ——, — —.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">B ADVERTISEMENT. There are some people, and two in particular, who, I have good reason to believe, are in America at this moment, whose feelings I would spare, although they may have little hope or expectation of such forbearance;—but sorrow and humiliation are sacred things—particularly such sorrow and humiliation as theirs: like spots of green earth, whereon the Deity hath spent his wrath—they cannot be approached, by the stoutest heart, or sternest forehead, without some emotion of terrour and solemnity. To them, this advertisement is addressed, as a warning; and I pray the publisher to indulge me so far, as to place it where it will immediately attract the eye. I would cause no spasm of the heart—no convulsion of the lips—even to my enemy. The name of Randolph may alarm them. If it should, they had better throw down the book: but, if it should not, let them look at the initials at the bottom of this. “They are used for the last time.” If they have still the courage to proceed, the consequences be upon their own head. If they have the wisdom to be silent, all may be well, notwithstanding; for they will soon find that I have no feeling of hostility or resentment toward them. I am merely doing my duty. All the letters that are genuine, I have come honestly by; and the rest are compiled from data, in my own possession, whose authenticity, they, I am sure, will be the last to dispute.— I am conscious of no violation of “trust or delicacy;” and had they consulted me, in any manner, except that of direct personal communication, before they threatened me; or, before they applied for the injunction, I could have satisfied them, that the first mode of proceeding was childish, and the last unwise, to say the least of it. There would have been more discretion in silence; and if they do not betray it, there is no other human being, not even the Chancellor himself, able to trace the history of their unhappy friend, in these volumes; or even to divine the cause of their application to him. The story is too remarkable, and the events too recent, to be distinctly told; and the little that is revealed, in its truth and nakedness, will be intelligible to only two human creatures; and is barely enough for the justification of an unfortunate and injured man, with them that are accessible to no other means of justification. Chance may, one day or other, when he is in his grave, bring the right persons acquainted with all that is material. They will weep then; and he will know it..... In the mean time, the publick may be amused, and agitated, perhaps, for a little season, without any suspicion of the truth. “W. V. R. “Bridgewater.” P. S.—“He forgave them—and blessed them—with his last breath.” As for Randolph, he has nothing to complain of. I have drawn him better than he is. If he be disposed to quarrel—he knows where I am to be found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RANDOLPH, A NOVEL. By the author of Logan—and Seventy-six. IN TWO VOLUMES. VOL. I. LETTER I. Baltimore, 24th Nov. 18—. No, dear; you are mistaken in Molton. He is not the abject creature that you believe. I have no proof to offer you, it is true;—nothing but my bare word; and that too, founded upon an interview of ten minutes. But, nevertheless, I do entreat you to believe me; or, if that be too much, Sarah, let me beg that you suspend your opinion awhile, and not express it, to any human creature, until you are assured that you are not wronging a noble nature. I wish that you could have seen him, cousin, when I handed your note to him. You would have given up all your prejudices, I am sure, on the spot; nay—you would have wept. As he read it, I saw a slight convulsion pass over his broad forehead;—it contracted a little too, and then, there was a quiet hectick; and his patient light blue eyes flashed fire;—and, if I must tell the truth, there was an angry fierceness in his look, for a single moment, that, in spite of myself, made me tremble; but, when this was followed, as it was, almost immediately, by a mortal paleness, and a slow, calm movement of the arm and hand, as he reached out the billet to me, it was really appalling. It almost took my strength away. Such a delicate creature,—so effeminate, and sickly!—it is unaccountable to me, how his presence should so affect me. I took the billet—I read it.—Shall I confess the truth, Sarah? I was shocked. All that you had told me, might be true;—he might be that consummate villain; as plausible, and as cowardly, as you had persuaded me to believe him;—but never did I so falter and wane before any mortal man, as before that feeble and emaciated being; with whom I had sought a quarrel; against whom, forgetting my own manhood, I had volunteered so many maledictions. Sarah—hear me!—By heaven, we have wronged him! I care not what proof you have to offer me;—nay, though it be that of your own senses—or mine —I would sooner doubt them both, than believe that Edward Molton is a scoundrel. No—the great God of heaven would not permit a scoundrel, so to profane and counterfeit the heroick bearing of innocence. Are you not amazed?—I am. I read over what I have written. I think over all that has passed since we parted; and I look in upon myself, with a strange feeling of doubt and perplexity. How is my opinion changed!—how have I confirmed all your predictions, when you bade me beware of listening to him, or looking upon him. You foretold this;—yet I laughed at you.—You said that, if I permitted myself to hearken to him, I was lost. I have hearkened to him.—He has used no argument;—no expostulation; no entreaty; no defence; yet, I declare to you, my dear Sarah, that I am ready, at this moment, as you said I should be, to bleed and die for Edward Molton— for whom?—Righteous heaven! for the destroyer of Juliet—the murderer of William.—Yes, yes!—give me more proof—more!—I am not satisfied;—or, I shall turn apostate to my cousin's memory; yea, battle for the man that slew him; and bleed for him, that spoiled and blasted the sweetest creature, by the God who made me—that ever inhabited this earth. O! Sarah, what is this surpassing, and mysterious power? Is not Edward Molton fashioned like ourselves? —feebler, it may be, in physical, and in intellectual resource? and yet, if they, that know him, are to be believed, so damnable a villain, that his very breath is poison, insinuating itself, like a subtile vapour into the sound and pure of heart; and there operating, like death, till all is blackness and ashes. But can this be? Would our Maker permit it? Are we to have no defence; not even from wisdom, doubt, or experience, against the wily and insidious? I am not old, it is true; but I have seen much of the world; and I never yet saw a confirmed villain, in whose lineaments, the Deity himself, had not written his B 2 history and character. And yet, here is a face, youthful, frank, open and dignified, where there is not a line, nor a shadow, but what looks like the boundary or communication between kingdoms, upon a map,—rather than the secret and dark tracking of banditti; and yet, you would have me believe that he is a magician in power, and a devil in heart; confirmed and established, in the most appalling and deliberate criminality. I cannot believe this, Sarah. I choose rather to believe that we are deceived, in some likelier way. But, if I should write forever, I could not communicate a thousandth part of what I feel toward that man,—that injured man. I say this, boldly;—I am ready to meet your ridicule, perhaps your scorn;—but, I will not stir another step in the affair—no, not even to call him out, which I would rather do, a hundred times, than suffer the compunction that I now feel, for having thought of such a thing. Sarah;— can you believe me!—I was afraid, yes, actually afraid to tell him my errand;—and, to this moment, he does not know that I had aught else with him, than to deliver your note. Farewell!—I am prepared for all that you can say. Yet I shall meet you, without trembling. I am prepared even to be classed with the fools and coxcombs, that are also subject to him;—nay, prepared to have my motives, and possibly my personal courage impeached. But no—I am wrong;—forgive me, Sarah. You will not be so unkind;—you will only say what you believe—that I am infatuated. Farewell, JOHN OMAR. Miss Sarah Ramsay, New-York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER II. REPLY. New-York, 29th November. Is it possible!—I pity you. Your letter, dear John, arrived almost as soon as we. I received it, in the parlour, and, though I trembled, I am sure, from head to foot, yet I had the presence of mind to open and read it, by the side of my father and mother. This was the only course left to me; for your imprudence, in directing it as you did, made them watch every movement of my countenance; and what could I have done, if my father, my kind, dear father, had asked me for it? O, let me entreat you cousin, to be less precipitate. It will be fatal to you, one day or other, I am sure. You are so direct, sudden, and rash, that I am always quaking for you.— I am interrupted — — — — ah! — — — I am called — — — — — I have returned and left them all talking about you; but, I have only a moment to spare, lest my absence may be taken notice of. There are only two things, or perhaps three, that I have time to say now; and they are these. You are infatuated. Edward is a villain: but I want you to tell me, exactly, how he looked and acted, (for he is a masterly actor, and can deceive any human being, youthful and artless as he appears, with the counterfeit of any passion, feeling, character or emotion.) Let me hear this, by the return mail; and I will then inform you of some other circumstances that have come to my knowledge, since I left Baltimore. But there is one favour, that I have to request of you;—be a little more temperate in your style. You know my opinion of such things. I hate fine writing in a letter, just as I hate fine talking in conversation. Adieu, S. P. S. I forgot to say, that, notwithstanding my prediction, I am really amazed, astonished and confounded at your extravagance. Nay,—although I foretold it, I did not believe it myself, cousin—that you, you should have been such a — upon my word, if out of the abundance of the heart, the pen had written,—you would have found rather an ungracious word, where that blank is. But tell me how he managed you. Defend yourself, I entreat you; John—hearken to me—defend yourself, or I shall despise you. Nay;—at this moment—Sarah, the “proud, unfeeling Sarah,” is weeping for you—weeping with shame and vexation. These blisters on the paper, —these blots and blurs—John! I do not often weep;— but, if you do not give me better reasons, than any that I can imagine, in your unexampled apostacy, I shall be tempted to swear, never again to shed a tear, whatever may become of you;—nay, to requite you with scorn and derision, for the distress that I feel at this moment. After all that I had said to you, too! Why, pride would have withheld you, if you were like any other human being. But, good bye!—let me hear, immediately; I shall not sleep, till you are restored to my respect. S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO MARY HOWARD. Washington, ———. I shall obey you, imperious girl. You know your power, and you abuse it. It is as I foretold you, when I detected the first yearning of your heart. But beware!— no woman shall hold me in thraldom longer than I can revere her. “Love!”—O Mary! you know not what love is. Do I?—look at me;—look in that glass—there is the face of the haughty Edward. That death-like aspect— these sunken temples—that is thy work. I do not know myself. The fire of my eyes, it may be, is not yet utterly quenched; but God knows that it soon will be. And, even now, there is something in their lustre, unlike the colour or brightness of health; and were I to see it in the eyes of another, in thine, Mary, I should weep;—but, as it is, there is a melancholy gladness about my heart, that comforts it, like the touch of a beloved hand, gently put upon a wounded part. My character is gone. What of that? It was sacrificed to thee. My health is blasted—death is within me —my vitals are decaying;—I can feel them weakening and detaching themselves, while I write, like the filaments of life from a dead heart;—but what of that?— Thou art the happier for it. Even now, I was on the point of slaying another man to thee! O woman! woman! what art thou made of? So beautiful, yet so deadly! I hear the echo of his departing step, now. The noise of the door, that he hath shut after him, is sounding in my ears now, like something miraculous; as if a dead man had arisen, from before my feet, and walked leisurely away from me. What saved him, Mary? I know not, unless it be his resemblance to—to—by heaven, I will write it, though it kill thee!— to Juliet!...... there!....... He knows not that I suspected his errand; no!—for, if he had, he should never have left my presence, alive!— What! bearded, baited, cursed and threatened, by children, even in the solitude of my own chamber! No.— George, George!—it was well for thy brother, and for thine too. William, poor William, that I was not obliged to trample on another of your headlong, impetuous blood. But let me proceed more gently. Here is the precious note that he brought. O, would that the writer were a man! Read it—read it, Mary, and tell me that you wonder at me. You ought—you will—I have surpassed myself. The boy came to murder me, and he went away my vassal. What a retinue I shall have!—the gallant, the athletick, the noble in heart, the wise, all subject to me—me! a weak and miserable creature, on whom the weakest might set his foot—if he dared. Read it!—and wonder, as I do, that my heart was not shivered into ten thousand pieces, when I read it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(NOTE ENCLOSED.) Baltimore, —, Monday morning. Sir— If you dare to set your foot within my father's house, you shall be treated as you deserve, by the servants. I will not see you. My opinions are well founded, and not to be shaken. I shall be on my return to New-York, when you receive this: and there is then, only one thing that you can do, to alter or change my hatred and contempt for you;—and that is, to repent and die. You have slandered a woman, whose only fault was her tenderness for you. You have not the courage, and the greatness to acknowledge it: and, I believe, are too abject, even to take the field in defence of your own miserable villany. Farewell, sir. I do not pray that you may be hanged, or drawn and quartered; no—but I do pray that you may live, till your heart ache at the recollection of your crime, as mine does at this moment, while I say that I pray God, in his mercy, to forgive me for having pronounced or written your name. Once more, farewell.— Do not flatter yourself that I have avoided you from fear. No.—I do not fear you; but I loathe and abhor you, as something unnatural and base. You are welcome to show this letter, if you dare;—the name I shall write, at full length, giving you all the advantage of your meanness; and you may show it, as I have no doubt that you will, to prove that you are on good terms with one of many, that detest and execrate you. I have told the bearer to avoid you—that you were to be avoided and shunned. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, what think you, Mary? Is not that about enough for mortal patience? What would you do? Advise me— counsel me. Shall I follow her to New-York, to France, to the ends of the earth—till I accomplish my purpose? What say you?—speak but the word, and so sure as my name is Edward Molton—so sure as I am beloved of thee, thou terrible woman, so sure will I bring that naughty girl to my feet—as I have thee. Nay, start not, Mary. Is it not true? Thou thinkest that I am in thy power. True—I am;—to a certain degree, I am;—but thou art abundantly more in mine. What! do I boast? I do, and defy thee—even thee, thou mysterious and passionate creature, with all thy loveliness and wrath, to rebel. And why? Because thou fearest to die; and I do not. Thou wouldst not survive my abandonment of thee;— thou wouldst go to thy grave, guilty, broken hearted, and shivering. But I—I should die like a hero—a martyr, in my own blaze, laughing at the devils that beckoned to me, and covering up my poor shattered heart, in its mortal spasms, from all, but most of all, from thee: for thou, woman, were I dying for thee, shouldst never know it;—and I would haunt thee, yea, I would, forever and ever, for thy desertion of me—even if thou wert unfaithful to my memory. What! have I not purchased thee?—purchased thee, in blood? And shall I permit another to approach thee?—never! And better 'twere for him, to penetrate the cavern where sleeps the young panther, under the watch of its famished mother, than go near where thou art sleeping! Mary!—I would make the world a solitude, had I the power, were one of its inhabitants but to think of thee, irreverently. I intended to tell thee how I received the boy, that came to fight me; but I must defer it, till I meet thee. I overcame him—I put the billet into his hand;—and, after a few words, I was calm, very calm—I bade him go in peace. He thought that I knew not his errand;—and well for him was it, that he did think so. Death! that I must conceal and darken the working of my soul before such children! I cannot tell thee, Mary, how I did it; but, I did it. In one word,—I conquered him. Thine, forever, Farewell!— EDWARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Annapolis, (Md.) Dec. —. I shall try to be “temperate” in my reply. Whether I shall succeed or not, will depend upon the route that my thoughts take. At present, I feel calm, and affectionately disposed; but you have wounded me, somewhat cruelly Sarah, and somewhat carelessly;—and my nature may take fire;—yet—no, my dear Sarah—I will not believe it; it was not unkindly meant, and I cannot retalite upon you. Your sentiments, respecting an epistolary style, are precisely my own. Nothing is so tiresome to me, as the conversation of one that talks “like a book;” and what is good letter writing, but written conversation?—free, natural, and unstudied, touching us rather, with its readiness, and simplicity, like the playfulness of a well bred woman, or the pleasantry of one, that—ah! I am transgressing again, so—no more of that. Of Molton. When he handed me your letter, I read it; and, I am not ashamed to say, that I read it, as for the first time. How different did it appear to me, while you read it, with your lips quivering, and your eyes darting fire about them, when I thought that he deserved your keenest, deadliest invective. But when I read it in his presence; that calm, beautiful self-possession, that gentle and deep serenity of his, which seemed disquieted but for a single moment, as he read, I am sure, with a convulsion at his heart; that unmanned me; I could have wept almost, for having so dishonoured him. Abuse me, Sarah; I can endure it;—but the truth I must tell. When I had done, I reached the letter back to him, without daring to lift my eyes to his face. I was overpowered with shame and sorrow, for the part that I had acted; and yet I was unspeakably happy that I had not, after my nature, abruptly insulted him, at once; and that continues to be a great consolation to me. But what converted me, you ask. Let me tell you.— The repose and steadiness of his look;—the quiet, habitual dignity of his motion;—the musick of his voice, so manly and composed, so unlike what I looked for, from one so emaciated and girlish. Little and effeminate men are so apt to be petulant and waspish, you know. He was leaning upon his hand. A silence, I should think, of four or five minutes, followed; after which, he slowly raised his head. His pale blue eyes had become intensely dark; and his light, silky hair, was disordered, strangely, by his hands, just as if he had been tearing it— while I was looking down upon the floor. “It is hard to bear,” said he, looking me full in the face,—“and I have only one reply to make to it. Do you believe that I deserve it?” The question was so abrupt, that it disturbed me; and I knew not what I said; but, to my last hour, Sarah, I shall not forget what he said—no, nor what he did. He arose, and came to me;—deliberately folded his arms: and never changed his attitude, or voice, or look, till I was ready to fall at his feet. “Sir,” said he,—“I understand your embarrassment.— I knew the cause. Your cousin Sarah, a high minded, but very imprudent girl;—nay sir, you will hear me out, I hope—has endeavoured to persuade herself, that I am an accomplished villain; nay, to persuade you. You are young and passionate, precipitate perhaps; and you adopted her opinions. But you had never seen me. She had never seen me. You have set with me but a few moments, and are convinced that you have done me wrong. Is this wise? Is it not as great an infirmity, to retract an opinion hastily, as to adopt, or advance it, hastily? If you are generous, I have you in my power; for, where the generous have done wrong, their atonement is disproportionate, enthusiastick, injudicious. I am unwilling to take advantage of this. But I wish you to judge for yourself. I do not ask you to go among my friends;—(his countenance darkened—it was even melancholy) for I have no friends; but I bid you go among my enemies.— Listen to them,—hear their stories, examine them; and if they be not more cunningly devised, than slander and falsehood usually are, you will find enough there, without hearing the other side, to set your heart at rest.— Their stories neutralize each other. Am I so artful, as they pretend? Then how can they, poor simpletons!— so plainly foretel my designs?” Am I so cautious? So difficult to elude, or detect?— so wise too, as they pretend? Then how happens it, that so many of my secret and portentous conspiracies, the most subtly conceived;—the most darkly perpetrated;—are a subject of familiar gossipping to the whole city? What am I able to blind the good and wise; to set the laws of my country at defiance? laugh to scorn the ministers of justice;—baffle them all—all! except the feeble, and timid, and shortsighted? Am I so weak, think you?—so very weak, and foolish, as to lay bare the mysterious and hidden operations of my heart, before women and children? ...... sir... I leave you to judge of me, for yourself.”...... “You have been cautioned against me. C I see it in your eyes. You think better of me than you intended to;—nay,—for it has been a common expedient with that extraordinary woman, your cousin, the bitterest enemy that I have on earth, I believe, and perhaps the most to be dreaded... You have been told... yes, I see that you have... your emotion betrays you,... your conscience is in your face—you have wronged me, Sir! What then? Do I reproach you for it? No. I forgive you....... Nay, as I was about to say, you have been cautioned against me, as a being of consummate address—(I started, and looked him full in the face;—but he betrayed no emotion. Was it chance? or how was it that he used your very words?) One whom, it would he fatal to your faculties... to your liberty, to approach!..... Did you believe her? Did she believe it herself? No sir, she did not. Perhaps it was the rhetorick of the sex... pray, do not be offended with me—I know your cousin Sarah, better than you do— (What did he mean by that, Sarah? Has he ever seen you? It could not be an idle boast; such men do not boast;.. nay, it was rather a threat, delicately uttered to be sure; but, nevertheless, a threat, which I should have resented on the spot, but for what followed.) She is a generous, heroick girl; but she has wronged me, and shall one day confess it. (This was said, in a tone of such solemnity, that my blood thrilled... it was really awful... it sounded like prophecy.) “No Sir. She did not believe it. But she knew this, that a man must be magnanimous indeed, who would dare to be the friend of another, whom he had heard called a villain;—nay, of one, whom he himself, it may be, had called a villain,—after he had been told too, that such was the power and authority of that villain, that no man could withstand, or resist him!.... Is it not so? She affected to believe that you were convinced—when you were not—when you only suspected it—of my evil nature— and she predicted, nevertheless, that you would become my friend, the moment that I opened my mouth... O, it was indeed a masterly contrivance!... for, no matter what proof I offered, there is not one man in a thousand, nay, in ten thousand, who after such a prediction would dare to believe me an injured fellow creature;— and still less, is there one that would dare to avow it. I have done—Farewell, Sir.” This was, as nearly as I can relate it, dear Sarah, the substance of our conversation. But his manner, that it was, which oppressed me. I felt humble and heart smitten while he spoke,.... I forgot the little difference in our ages; and I listened to him, I declare to you, like one who hears patiently, some much older, and wiser, and better man, upbraiding and admonishing him, with the voice of compassionate authority... What did I, when he had done?.... Ask me Sarah, ask me, if thou durst... I gave him my hand;—and I would have fallen upon his neck.... and I would have wept, but for the shame that I felt to weep before such a noble creature. I awoke, as from a trance, when he had finished; and all the echo of his deep solemn voice had died away. I saw his great heart heave, as I took his hand; and there was a motion of his fingers, after they passed hurriedly through his beautiful hair, and over his hollow clear temples, just as if he dashed away a tear with them. There—I have made my defence. Despise me, if thou canst.— Scorn me, trample on me; but remember, there will be a day of retribution for thee. Sarah! I can see thee weeping... Gracious God—surely I do see something... ............... I left off abruptly Sarah, for my candle was very low; and, perhaps, the painful agitation, in which I have been kept for a whole week, together with the unpleasant, strange solitude, about this old house, was the cause of a singular deception—hark!—........ Again!.. it is very strange... I could have sworn that some one was breathing near me; and, as I turned, there was a soft sound, that, to my ear, seemed like naked feet... passing secretly away from my elbow... I wish that I was out of this uncomfortable old mansion,—these fancies are very childish, to be sure; and yet, they agitate me, as if I were some fooolish girl, shut up in one of the old haunted ruins of ... but this will never do... On looking back, I find that I was about saying that I could almost see thee weeping; yes, weeping Sarah, in contrition and bitterness, for what thou hast said of Molton. Good night!.. It is dark as Egypt already; and these last words are scribbled by chance; and all connected together, for I dare not lift my pen from the paper, lest I should put it down in the wrong place. Farewell,— Good Night. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MARY TO EDWARD MOLTON. Washington, Dec. —. My own dear Edward, I have just left the President's house. I have come away early—disturbed by another resemblance—but no, I will not regard it. There are faces that haunt me, turn where I will; and sometimes, I should almost fancy myself surrounded by the painted, embroidered puppets of St. James —. But stay, let me divert my thoughts. I have come away, wearied to death, and heart sick of their wretched folly and parade. O, Edward, when I used to listen to thee, till I thought my heart would burst; and hear thee talk of this great people, so full of republican simplicity, so stern and spartan-like, “a commonwealth of kings,” till thy strange face shook all over, with the passion beneath it, like the reflection of something terrible in troubled water; my spirit arose, to intercede for them, among the kings, and princes, and nobility of Europe. I scorned and mocked at the follies of the old world; and my chest heaved to participate in the wise and awful solemnities of this. Why did I trust to thee, Edward? Thou art altogether an American. Why did I follow thee, hither? Shall I tell thee what I expected to see? I will—men and women—Lacedemonians, at least—characterised by sublime plainness and strength—full of republican grandeur,—august in republican sobriety and steadiness;— deriding, calmly, but with a derision that kings would not encounter, all the trapping, and appendage, and parade, and nonsense of royalty. But what have I found! Edward, I am used to speak plainly; and I shall not depart from my settled habitude, even thought it may hurt thee;—for thou knowest my veneration for such men as George Washington, and others, like him, the growth of America, when God, himself, fought her battles, and bred her children;—and thou wilt endure my plainness, while I lament her degeneracy. What have I found —! —. I will tell thee—a plebeian nobility—a struggle for precedence between the families of to-day—and the families of yesterday;—paltry titles, given and taken by all ranks, without authority or right;—our worst follies and worst vices awkwardly imitated and carricatured;—talent and virtue in the dust; greatness under the chariot wheels of wealth;—a republican court affecting to disdain the patricians of Europe— their titles and diamonds; their regal foolery; the hierarchy of our churches—and the ermine of our judges and chancellors;—yet loaded with dirty finery; crowded and blazing with paste jewelry; and Squires and Honours; and Excellencies! and Bishops! O, is it not paltry! Nay, Edward, so ridiculous is this bustle and parade of imitation, at times, that I should be tempted to laugh at it, outright, were it not too serious a thing for laughter, when considered in its true light,—the symptom of a mortal degeneracy, in a brave and great people. Washington, you must know, and you must know it in this way too, (for your stay here was quite too short, for you to make any observation for yourself) is a sort of metropolis; the city of “magnificent distances,” as the Abbé somebody called it, where people enquire after each other's health by a telegraph; make love by the pennypost—and recognise a difference of fifteen minutes in the time at their chambers and places of business—where, as in Paris, or London, all the poison and death of the whole system are concocted at leisure; and whence, they are distributed to all the healthy extremities, until they learn C 2 to languish and palpitate for the unnatural aliment. But I am getting too serious; and were I disposed to be a little merry, at one of the most melancholy hours of my life, which is exactly this, I should continue the illustration, and inform my Edward, that I have lately seen some of the natural consequences of excess;—met a few sufficiently alarming contractions—disorders—and spasms, within the last week—ah! the door opens — — * * * * * a letter from thee, Edward!—O, how welcome to my exhausted and sick heart. I have read it. Boaster!—would that I had thee, here!—I knew not what I should do—fatigued and wearried to death as I am,—with thy rebellious and confident spirit—(that is a badly constructed sentence Edward;— it is easily misunderstood, if thou'rt in an evil disposition, but I have not the heart to mend it.) If—oh if thou wert here, how could I rebuke thee;—indeed, I know not—perhaps, turn to thee, dear, and fall asleep in thy bosom. O, come to me!—It is so wearing, this impertinent routine of folly and dissipation, that I had rather hear thy voice in its sternest mood, when I kneel before thee, trembling in every joint, than endure this chill and lonely, desolate feeling, which follows the riotous excitement of such a place as —: No, I cannot write any more—my heart is too full —good night, Edward—good night—dear, dear Edward—good night! Forever and forever—thine! MARY —.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Morning.— I have just read thy letter again, Edward. It is hardly light enough yet, to see the characters that I trace with my pencil; and it is exceedingly cold; yet, here I am, sitting up in my bed; my port folio before me; and the cold day-light shining on the paper, with a feeble and sickly lustre—poh!—I will be in better spirits. I will answer thee, as I would that thou shouldst me, had I written thee such a letter as thine. So—away with all despondency and complaint. For awhile, I will be proud of heart, and forget that I am in a land of strangers,—hapless and alone—guilty—O God!—and, perhaps, even now, now while I am writing, a widow indeed, abandoned, not by her husband, not by her legitimate lord—no, but by the spoiler of her fame—the rifler of her wretched heart—a lover!—O, Edward! kill me, if thou wilt, I can endure that, dear, from thy hand; but do not abandon me—do not tell me again that thou canst—O, no—think what thou wilt, meditate what thou wilt—but O, in mercy, do not tell me, unless thou wouldst see me dying of a broken heart, upon the threshold of thy dwelling, do not tell me that thou ever couldst abandon me, whatever may happen. No—I will not—I do not believe it. Thou durst not—O, Edward forgive me!—I am distracted— I know not what I say—Yet, thou durst; for thou durst do any thing. Do not be angry with me, dear—forgive me, and do with me what thou wilt;—yet do not tell me so plainly that thou art dying—O, no—nor of what thou couldst do—no, no don't do that;—do any thing but that. That will kill me. Nothing else can. My parents, my poor parents—they know that I am not made like other women;—nay, why remind thee of that. Unnatural as I was to them, thou implacable man, what have I been to thee, but the most dutiful, the most affectionate, devout and trembling woman? And couldst thou abandon me? O, Edward, what have I done to thee, that thou shouldst dare—what! dare again—indeed, I forgot myself, but this language is so natural to me; and then, it would be so proper, if addressed to any other human creature—than to Edward. What wonder then, if I sometimes forget that thou art an exception to the family of man. Edward! come to me—I cannot answer thy letter. I meant to; I took my pencil up for the purpose; (for the ink is frozen) but I have been unable to see, plainly, what thou hast written;—my eyes are dim, and blood shot—I hope not with an evil spirit—my own writing looks unlike the tracing of lead—it is fiery, red, and luminous. No matter;—come to me, Edward, and I will forgive thee all — Curse me, if thou wilt, but come to me. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH RAMSAY TO JOHN OMAR. New-York, — —. What, John, “no argument,” none!—“no entreaty; no expostulation!”—I quote your own words. In my last, I promised to communicate something of moment, which I learnt, accidentally, on my route; but, before I do that, I must look over your letters together. How is it that I find so many contradictions in them? You, surely, do not mean to deceive me; and, I believe, are incapable of a deliberate misrepresentation; yet, on recurring to two or three, (I go no further back) I find many things that, to me, are irreconcileable. You often appear to forget what you have already written, or said upon the subject, that is most interesting to us; you abound in repetitions; beautiful, but extravagant language; and, I know not what else, that, unwilling as I am to suspect you, have put me upon examination; the result of which is, that, after making all due allowance for your rashness, warmth and impetuosity, I find many things, yes, many John, which are mysterious and dark to me. But let me mention some of them,—in order as they occur, in your own letters. I shall leave you to explain them;—perhaps I am too serious, cousin;—but, really, it appears no light matter to me, for one so naturally frank and ingenuous as you really are, by nature, to be caught doubling on his track..... In your first letter, (the first of the three, now before me) you speak of Jane, in a manner, that, as I then told you, was alarming to me. I cautioned you emphatically against her, in my reply. I knew her well, and I never loved her. She is an artful, cold hearted, showy, unprincipled girl; and I should have been more pleased, had you been more struck, and astonished, at her talent and deportment, at the first sight. Why?—for the reasons that I have already assigned. Sudden and violent impressions are not lasting, cousin; but they that insinuate themselves, more delicately and tenderly, they are to be dreaded. Jane knows your disposition well—she knows that you cannot love a brilliant or obtrusive girl;— and, I am sure, that she will withhold every manifestation of her dazzling and unrivalled power, merely for the purpose of appearing amiable. I told you this at first. I foretold her whole plan; and was—naturally enough, laughed at, for my pains. Yet, she has done all that I foretold; and you not only have kept it a secret from me, but led me into a belief that you were neither interested nor amused with her, while you were actually in her power, to a great degree. I wrote to you, and prayed for a direct and explicit answer. You wrote a letter, to be sure, in reply; but it was no answer. You evaded all my questions. Once more, however, I am resolved to try you; and I shall probe deeply, because I know your infirmities; and, because I believe, that, if you have the courage and manhood to persevere, as you have promised me, you will become a distinguished man. John—your reputation is dear to me. You know that I am not in the habit of saying what I do not mean; or, of using words bigger than my thought; and, I hope, therefore, that you will take what I am about to say, in the very spirit, with which it is written. I would lay down my life, cousin John, cheerfully, to promote your true happiness. Will you be kind enough to remember that;—and, if you please, preserve this letter, to try my sincerity hereafter, in any vicissitude. I shall never repeat it;—but I hope that it will not be forgotten. Let me return to the subject. You are vain. You acknowledge it; and, at times I think, are ashamed of it. But your vanity lies deeper than you imagine; and, what is worse, on a side that you do not suspect. You are most accessible on that point,—which, I dare say, you have never thought of. If a woman would win you, and had the art to manage you steadily, she would never praise your talents; for, of them, you have certainly a very just opinion now. I do not say this, en badinage, John, to fall for once, into your weakness, of saying in another language, what may be so much better said in our own, but because it is true. After many mortifications,—many disappointments, and much heart burning, you have arrived at a pretty fair, rational estimate of your own talent. A woman, therefore, who attempts to win you, if she act wisely and artfully, will affect to discover some qualities in you, that the world have never seen. All that is obvious to others, she will overlook. She will never attempt to dazzle or astonish you. But she will do this;—she will aim either to subdue you by her timidity, and gentleness of spirit;—or by an affectionate bashfulness, constantly breaking out, through all her attempts at concealment and restraint. She will get you, gradually, to become accustomed to her society. She will adopt your opinions, not, by avowing them loudly, and perpetually, with her lips; but by acting in conformity to them. Her deportment will be retiring and melancholy; timid and abstracted; and there will be, with an occasional pensiveness, and resignation, a dart of fire thrown out, now and then, to show you that she does not want for spirit. She will appear to have no relish for the world; her very eyes will betray a sort of willingness to be out of it, at the same time that she will appear too pious to wish for death; and too submissive, to rebel against, or even to repine at, the dispensation, under which she is fading: nay, if she be truly what I think Jane is, she will manifest a continual, but apparently reluctant deference to your opinion, taste, thought and judgment; but this will be a delicate and insinuating deference, invisible to all but yourself. It will appear to you, the unwilling obedience of a gentle spirit, afraid of your influence, alarmed at your ascendency, and on her guard against your power. She will even dress in your favourite colour;—and wear her beautiful hair, after the manner that she alone has heard you commend in some other, or in some picture, or piece of statuary; but—she will not do this, immediately after she has heard your opinion;— or, if that opinion were uttered before a third person, she may not do it at all, because she knows well, that the self love of a man like you, is never so fastidiously sensible, as when it finds, what it is apt to call, a simple and innocent heart, offering secret tribute to him, unconsciously; no, she will not do this immediately, lest other women might baffle her, or other men put you upon your guard; but she will do it soon enough afterward, to attract the attention of a vain man;—and, in that way too, which he cannot help seeing. Such flattery to a sensitive man, if well timed, is really irresistable. All women know this; but few have the tact to profit by it. I have seen more than one sensible girl completely thrown out, by overdoing the part: and many a beautiful one, who did it, continually, without knowing it. Would they learn the art in perfection? Let them watch the manner of a woman, that really is in love. To her lover, every thing that she says or does; every intonation of voice, and every movement of her body or face, tell the tale; but, while they tell the tale to him—it is to him alone—to the world, it is all an impenetrable mystery. In proportion as he is flattered, the world are blinded: and, in proportion as they are blinded, if his be a delicate mind, he is flattered. Now, tell me the truth, John. Is not this, exactly what Jane does? Is not she full of such unpremeditated witchery?—have you not already become so accustomed to her society, that you are uneasy, if you do not see her on some regular, certain evening? Do you not find too, that, one way or another, you are more and more with her, every week of your life, accidentally, as you think;—but, are not the intervals of absence less frequent and less long? Have you not learnt to hear your names coupled, without any feeling of surprise, by the gossipping people of the town? Answer me, boldly cousin;—and then, for my last question on this subject, let me ask you this,—for this is the balancing point—the verdict—“the issue” as your young friend, the lawyer, would say, upon which all your future happiness may depend. Have you not learnt to look with compassion upon all the bodily infirmities of that girl?—to forget many circumstances in her situation, and in that of her family, which, to a reasonable man, nay, to yourself, a few months since, would have been not only rational, but insurmountable objections to a marriage?—a marriage!—you are amazed. Yes—I dare say that you are. But hear me. Habits are dangerous things; the most destructive are formed slowly and quietly. Men do not fall in love, where they expect it—men of sense, I mean. Why?—Because they go, fortified in adamant, to encounter women, who are thought especially beautiful or perilous. Yes;—and we are never in such danger of being overcome by any habit, as when we believe that, it is at our own choice, to tear ourselves away from it, whenever we please. Sampson and Gulliver were both sleeping, when they were bound;—and cobwebs have held stronger men, who were weak only as you are, cousin, in their security;—they fall from too much self confidence. Compassion has destroyed many. It may make you,—what you little believe now; and what you would have mocked at, six months ago, the husband of a haughty, sick girl, of an ambitious spirit, and most unamiable temper. Tell me, John—I entreat you—have you not already learnt to regard yourself as, in some measure, necessary to the happiness of Jane? O—I am afraid that you have. If so, you are lost,—forever lost; for, if she can once persuade you that her happiness is at your mercy, your noble, unthinking heart, will be offered up in sacrifice. Cousin—I tremble for you. Yet I must seal this long, long letter, here; and delay my other admonitions, until I hear, explicitly, in reply to these.... Adieu. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bless me—on folding it, I find that the sheet is entirely covered. What shall I do? It would be a pity to send a blank envelope; so, I will even delay the whole, till to morrow, and then try to finish my sermon.— * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Well cousin, I have read over what I wrote last evening; and, I find that there is nothing material omitted, except the text; and that, you will be kind enough to bear in mind, is your vanity; not the vanity of exciting love, and being beloved. Persuade you that you have made a woman love you, and she may do what she will with you. And now, if you please, for the mystery and darkness complained of. Why have you never told me to what extent your intimacy with Jane had gone? Why, when you must have seen the blessed Juliet, the dear suffering Juliet, so often, have you always spoken of her, as if by report? Were you afraid to tell the truth? Confess it, John; you may as well. After all that I have heard you say of “puppy love,” and childish marriages, without any view to futurity, sickness, a family, or widowhood, you were ashamed to tell me, that you were drifting to the same precipice. But there is something, yet more serious, to be laid at your door. After your interview with that Molton;— that wretch, whose very name is so hateful to me, that my hand is convulsed, and my frame shivers, as I write it, you told me that he used “no argument, no expostulation, no entreaty” to convince you that he was an injured man. I reply—I demand the particulars—you answer me. And lo!—this creature of the imagination, instead of rebuking, in the sublime quiet of a great heart, as you had represented, all suspicion and doubt, and dishonour; had really argued the question of his guilt and innocence, before you, in a masterly style—deliberately—and... John—dear John—I have no more to say—no, nothing —except this. Jane has conquered you, by appealing, adroitly, to your generosity—and he—he (for I will never write his name again, if I can help it)—has conquered you, in the same way. You ask me what he means, by saying that he knows me. He is a liar. That is a phrase, cousin, that you never heard me use before;—but he deserves it. He does not know me. You ask too, if he has ever seen me. I answer no—I believe not. I have seen him; but, it was at a distance, and in a crowd. He was pointed out to me by Juliet herself. He threatens me too; does he?—well, I do not tremble. Nay,—if he can make me feel that I have wronged him, I will go down on my knees before him— and your prophecies shall be fulfilled. Monstrous!—if aught could add to the unutterable atrocity of that man —after his deliberate abuse of the high talent that heaven hath given him;—after his cold blooded, profligate abandonment, of the highest and holiest affections of the human heart—it is this immoveable bearing. But heaven will not be insulted, forever. I shall live to see him— perhaps it is now my time to prophesy—, scathed and riven with the judgment of Him, who shall not be derided with impunity. Once more, Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">D EDWARD MOLTON TO MARY HOWARD. Washington, — —. I am astonished!—at a publick house!—what could possess you?—I—I—why did you not write, and tell me?— Forgive me, my dear girl;—but, indeed, you have no idea how cruelly I have suffered by your silence—your illness too!—ah, I knew by the manner, in which your letter concluded, that I could not, to your rescue, too speedily. In fifteen minutes, I was in the saddle. I am here— here, where you slept but two nights ago;—yet, where are you? Whither went you in such haste?—I came to you, love—ready, with my lips, to draw out the poison from every wound of your poor heart—O, Mary, where art thou!—Raving perhaps;—forsaken—helpless—even as thou saidst in thy letter;—and I, what can I do for thee? pale, weary—my very blood, the little that there is left of it, all running, with a sensation of mortal coldness to my temples. Where art thou Mary? The iron is rusting in my heart; and no hand but thine, dear, can pluck it out— O, no—I did not mean it. I did not—believe me. I do love thee, Mary—love thee beyond all—all—in heaven and earth.—Ah!—a paper! * * * * * Bless thee love—heaven forever bless thee! But how couldst thou foresee this? Didst thou know, love, that I should inhabit thy chamber so soon?—so soon throw myself upon that pillow?—O, I see the motive that agitated thee.

This line is sufficient.— “To the mansion,” says thy billet—why, then, I must have passed thee on the road * * * * I must return — I — I shall send this by William, charging thee not to enter that house.

Be very careful—as my sister, thou wilt have to be especially guarded, while we are there, which shall be no longer than while William can light a fire in our rooms at —. E. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH RAMSAY. Really, Sarah, I do not know what to say to your extraordinary letter. Sometimes I feel hurt and mortified; and then a little angry; but, at last, I have come to a resolution, to answer it, plainly, and to the point. You once complained of my long letters; and, when, in one of mine, that afterward fell into your hands, I said, with some little bitterness, perhaps, that there were persons, who could endure long letters from me; you reproached me for it;—silently, to be sure, but so as to make me feel that I had behaved like a child. Now, I do not complain of long letters, unless where a long conversation, from the same person, on the same subject, would be tiresome; and I am really thankful for yours, the longest and cruellest that you ever wrote. Yes—I am extravagant. I am vain,—and I do not always proportion my word to my thought; for all which, I am sorry, and—and—but no matter— I will not promise, as I used to, in such cases, never to offend again, in the same way,—because that were impossible to perform. I will only say, my dear, excellent cousin, that I will undertake a thorough and serious reformation in the matter. I shall not succeed at once;— I know that I sha'nt—and shall occasionally provoke your animadversion, for a long time, I dare say; but, in the end, I hope to prevail. Habits, that are long in forming, are long in correcting;—awkward enough—is'nt it. Sarah? But you will understand me, and that is all that I desire, at present. You are wrong, and ungenerous too, for the first time, in your opinion of Jane. She is not the artful girl that you suppose;—there is much more of innocence, kindness, and simplicity in her disposition, than you would imagine. But—I do not like her. I never could love her—and I have told her so!—not, to be sure, in so many words; but she happened to play off some of her management, a little too adroitly, in the very way that you mentioned; and so, I thought it was time to speak plainly; as plainly as I could, without wounding her, or distressing myself. She understood me, and I left off going to the house for about a month; and then renewed my visits; but, scarcely had I got upon my old familiar footing,— than I caught her at the same manœuvreing again. I abandoned the house entirely, for a time; and, finally, managed to give her a better bargain—in our acquaintance of the hills. They will soon be married. So that, so far as Jane is concerned, your advice, which is excellent, and made me laugh more than once, till the tears came into my eyes, while I was comparing it, with what had actually taken place, is altogether gratuitous. And here, you know that I might stop;— but to give you a proof of my unreserved sincerity toward her, who would lay down her life for me.—I cannot help telling you, that I have been as constant a visiter, as you have heard, at Mrs. Palmer's fire place; but my visits were not to Jane. To whom, then? To nobody. But why did I go? I'll tell you, frankly, Sarah;—to be near a sweet girl, who is dying in a consumption. O, no, not to talk, or laugh with Jane—no, but to look at—shall I name her—the innocent, the affectionate, the dying Juliet. How blind are the world! Nay,—even the acute Sarah, and the heart broken creature, whom I have gone to sit by, and listen to, that I might come away afterward, and weep, even they are as blind as the world. I have been accused of loving all but her;—all!—and yet, about her alone, hath my spirit lingered, like one held by enchantment, fearing to breathe or speak, night after night, without daring to look her in the face, or even to approach her—the sweet sufferer. O Sarah—I have set by her while her delicate frame shivered, and her very hands were unsteady, upon the table, where they rested, when some distant allusion was made to her destroyer, till all the blood in my body was boiling up against him—yes, he must be a villain— such a sight were better than all the argument in the world—and yet—no, no—I will see him first—hear his story—sound him to the heart. “Have I paid her attention?” No. “Do I love her?”—I know not,—but I compassionate her;—and, I would die, to make her happier. Toward all other women, my faculties approach loftily, and undismayed. But when I attempt to approach her, O, there is a feeling of religion;—a something that I cannot express—that rebukes me—and I stand before her meek, uncomplaining gentleness, with a mixture of sorrow, and trembling, and self reproach, that I am of the same species, with a creature, who could meditate aught of mischief to one like her. O—I well nigh forgot to tell you, that Molton has a beautiful half-sister, a most queen-like creature, who has been some weeks at Washington, the wonder and idolatry of the place. He has just returned with her; and, it is said, intends going over to Europe. I hope not. I am very earnest to see Maria Howard as she is called. She has been seriously ill, I am told; and he is the most affectionate brother in the world—constantly with her, since last Tuesday evening, when they arrived. Thank heaven! I have sold the house;—and I am now at liberty to pursue my studies, just as I desire. J. O.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO SARAH RAMSAY. —'s Place, Jan. —. What is all this correspondence, between you and brother John, about, coz? It looks very suspicious, let me tell you, when such an au—aug—august,—yes, that's the word—when such an “august creature” as you are, is found interchanging whole quires of paper, with such a madman as brother John. The world will talk, Sally; and I warn you in season—: so good bye—. Now dont tell me again, that I never wrote a long letter in my life. It is true,—this is the first, and probably the last; for, really I'd rather talk myself into a consumption, D 2 as John has already, than scribble myself cold, as I have now, to one that will curl her hair with the tenderest things that I can say, and so—. No—I can't eke out another line. It must go, as it is;—but, if you ever reply, pray be good enough to say, how the devil you manage to write so many pages, when it worries me into a fever, to write a few sentences. Adios, FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O, I open this to tell you the best thing in this world. You know that John has sold his house. I dare say that he has told you of it. But to whom, think you?—that's the question!—to whom? To the agent of Edward Molton! —your chief favorite!—you know. Lord, how I laughed at him. It was admirably managed: and Molton is in actual possession, at this moment. Sarah—I can't— I can't laugh;—it makes me serious when I think of the villain—: its a good trick, though; but, damn him—I say it, emphatically, damn him. F.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO FRANK. My Dear Cousin, I thank you for your foolish letter, and hasten to set you, hair-brained as you are, upon the scent of our prey, a wild beast cousin, that may be tracked in blood. Judge of my earnestness, when I consent to overlook your swearing, and address you, seriously. But so it is. I have just received a letter from Washington, which I must commit to your care. Do not deceive me, Frank. I think that I know you. That unthinking levity of yours, is affectation. You are boisterous, and rude, that you may not be suspected of sentiment. Is it not so?— Have you not been too keenly alive to—but no. It is enough for me, that you have a steady hand, and a stout heart. Will you do me a favour? I want to put your life at hazard. But that is not all. That you will permit, I am sure, whatever may be the cause. But I demand what is more difficult for you to perform;—yet, the cause is worthy of it—a continual effort. Can you be a man?—stern, inflexible and serious, for a while;— a few weeks only. You can—you will. I shall understand that you are ready to be, what I am sure you are capable of being, with all your constitutional rashness, and affected frivolity, a prudent, but implacable minister of justice, if you do not refuse, by return mail. By the enclosed, you will perceive that I have good reason to suspect that the girl, whom you will recollect only, as Helen, and speak of, in the same way, when you write to me, lest any of our letters should miscarry, is really in this country, after all:—nay—that she is, in what capacity I know not, whether wife, or mistress, a follower of Edward Molton!—You are thunderstruck. But, I have no time to explain. You will perceive also, who and what she is, by the enclosed; which, after reading it, I beg you to return to me. Perhaps the tremendous riddle is about to be unfolded. O, how sincerely, how fervently, do I pray to our Heavenly Father, that it may be! Frank—my dear, dear Frank, think what I am trusting to you;—the honour of a whole family. Ah, be not indiscreet, or precipitate. I have chosen you, in preference to John, because I think it safer;—for, to deal plainly with you, nobody would ever suspect me of employing you, in an affair of so much delicacy and mystery. The moment that you have read this, and re-enclosed the contents to me again, you will take immediate steps, to ascertain the truth of the conjecture. I have little doubt now:—but we must be certain, entirely certain, before we act. SARAH RAMSAY. (The following Letter was enclosed.) TO MISS SARAH RAMSAY. My dear young lady,—A circumstance has occurred this morning, which seems to justify, in no slight degree, your strange suspicion—respecting a certain person.— You know how she was admired and sought after; and truly, I never saw a more fascinating creature. She left here, very abruptly, about a fortnight since; and the next day, a gentleman arrived at the house, and was shown directly to her chamber, at his own request, by a black girl who happened to be in the hall, when he entered. But just as he was on the point of opening the door of Miss Howard's room, he seemed to recollect himself; for he turned, and asked the stupid little creature, in a threatening manner, where the lady of the house was.— The child was terrified, and ran, screaming, down the stairs. The gentleman, whom nobody knows here, although it is said, that he was seen here about three weeks before, behaved like a distracted man. He must have thought it a publick house; for, when the family were alarmed, Mr. Arrinaut the elder son of Madame Arrinaut, at whose house, the lady chaperone of Miss Howard, had stayed, was sent for;—all were silent as death till he came—nobody dared to enter. He ran up stairs, and found the stranger folding a note, just written; and another lying by him on the table, which, from the appearance of the writing, Mr. Arrinaut does not doubt to have been Miss Howard's. “What business have you here, Sir”—said Mr. Arrinaut. The stranger, he says, looked at him, for a moment, as if amazed at his rudeness;—and then quietly went up to him—and asked him where Mary was. “Mary!—what Mary?—Do you mean Miss Howard, Sir?” said Mr. Arrinaut. “I do”—answered the stranger;—and then, as if suddenly recollecting himself, while the tears stood in his eyes,—he added—“Gracious God, sir—I am sadly afraid I—I pray you, where am I?—how came I here?—what have I done?” “Please to give me your name, first, sir,” said Mr. Arrinaut, “and descend with me to the parlour.” “Edward Molton,” was the reply. “What!—the brother of Miss Howard?” “The same.—The brother—aye—the half brother of Miss Howard.” Mutual apologies and explanations immediately took place. The brother, it appeared, had been led into a strange mistake. From the similarity of names, he had been induced to believe that she was in a publick house; and, therefore, had came on for the purpose of taking her away, even from the excellent woman who accompanied her. He mounted his horse immediately, after being informed of her return to Baltimore, and departed at full speed. The story, with many aggravations, soon got abroad; and, at last, came back to our house, with the addition, that this enchanting woman was not named Howard—and —was not his half sister!—I sent my brother, who is cruelly sensible, on matters of this sort, since the imposition practised upon us last year, by Miss * * * * to trace the story to its author. Would you believe it!—He found a gentleman in the suite of —, who had seen this Mary Howard at court!—He was not acquainted with her, or her family; but was sure that her name was not Howard, when she was presented. At the —'s last ball, he met her again; and sat next to her at the supper table. She would not know him.— There was some mystery about it; for her eyes betrayed a consciousness of having met his before. She retired early; coloured, as she passed him; then turned, haughtily, toward him in particular, and bade him good night. This was the last time that she was in company. He is a sensible man; a profound observer of human nature; and has told me, plainly, that he thinks there is somewhat suspicious in her deportment—“I do not believe that she knew me,” he said—“but I am sure that my countenance troubled her.” I am much changed since she saw me. I never saw her but once; and, while she has not entirely forgotten my face, yet, it is probable, that she cannot remember where she has seen me. Thus I account for her perplexity;—no, her name is not Howard—nor is she married. Perhaps she has eloped;—and now, it does appear to me, that I have heard something of that sort— she was very much celebrated; and came out, at the last Drawing Room that I attended. Yes—yes—it is so— her name, I have lost; but I have an indistinct recollection, that there is somewhat wrong in her history.” I related this to our charming friend, who was, of course, much shocked; but she forbore all reproaches till she had arrived at a greater degree of certainty. All the town was in uproar about the affair. She was cruelly censured, and misrepresented; yes, she!—who, but a few days ago was idolized and caressed by the whole city, for having such a “melancholy, and magnificent” creature, as they called Miss Howard, then, under her guardianship. In justification of herself, she showed me the letters which Miss Howard brought; and you know too, that she came in the company of the celebrated Mr. —, the member from —. How was it possible to doubt her credentials? And why should we doubt them? Was she not beautiful, accomplished; and, at the worst, of high rank abroad? And why should we be fastidious? We are unreasonable, dear, are we not, to complain of their cast off gentry? Heaven and earth!—Mrs. B— was at my elbow. Another discovery! A handkerchief has been found with—what, of all the letters of the alphabet, think you, marked upon it? With no others, my dear Miss Ramsay, than H. W. O. Yes; it is a fact, I assure you. I have seen them myself. They were marked originally in blue silk, and have been picked out; but, so recently, that they can be plainly traced by a faint blue stain. You may judge of our consternation. We sent immediately for the paper in which the advertisement appeared; and, at last, succeeded in getting it —but not from the office. The papers have all been taken off the files, and there was not a copy to be had in the city; but, at length, we recollected an acquaintance, who was in the habit of cutting out the pieces that struck her, for any reason whatever, in the papers of the day. We sent to her, and luckily obtained it. Yes! the very letters! Good heaven! how deceived have we been! All flashes upon us now, so clearly, that we wonder at our own blindness. The same lofty carriage—the same impassioned tenderness of tone—the very colour of the hair and eyes—and yet, that we should never have suspected her! How strange! But then, who would have thought of looking here for your Helen; that most interesting and unfortunate creature; that subject of so much inquiry and wonder, throughout all America? Really, my dear, there are things of daily occurrence, in common life, more extravagant and improbable than we ever find in romances and novels; just, I dare say, as there are skies and trees, which no painter would dare to copy. Nay, to add to our wonder, we are just told, (for nothing else is heard of in Washington, now,) that Miss Howard herself, when that advertisement appeared, read it aloud, at Mrs. L----'s breakfast table. It is distinctly recollected; because she read it, in a manner very unsual to her, en badinage.— What a wonderful woman she is? Tell me, if you know, where she is—and who? We are dying to know her history; and I, for one, shall persist in believing well of her, in spite of appearances, until I know that she is unworthy. And above all, I pray you, my dear Miss Ramsay, not to forget that we are equally curious to know who, and what her brother is. Is he named Molton? Where does he live? Tell us all that you know; for he has excited a strange interest here. Mr. Arrinaut says, that he is the most extraordinary man, that he ever met with;— that, at first, he thought him a lunatick; but that, when he entered the parlour, and made his apology, with such an air of gentlemanly self possession, pained and distressed as he was, with his awkward mistake;—and, particularly when he mounted at the door (and, by the way, he says that he never saw a man sit a horse so “royally”)— he, Mr. Arrinaut, was “awestruck”—and affected, inconceivably affected, by the melancholy lustre of his eyes. Ma chere amie toujours à toi! P. Washington City, ——, 182—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO SARAH. Your confidence, cousin, has made a man of me. I have read the enclosed, in consternation and dismay. If the sister of Molton be really Helen —, it is highly probable that Molton, himself, is the wretch, of whom we have been so long in search. How providential it is— Can he possibly elude us now? Can you imagine any escape? Struck by your confidence in me, and ashamed, heartily ashamed, of that affectation, with which you charge me, I have attempted to become, at one step, what you would have me be. But perhaps you would like a reason for what I have been. It is this—other men are silent in their humiliation and distress; or else they complain. I never complain. Thus much of religion have I--that, to whatever happens, I am resigned. “Whatever is—is right.” I cannot be silent, when, by constitution and habit, I am believed to be volatile and noisy; no—whatever I might be at a fitting opportunity—I cannot, now, be silent and thoughtful; because I cannot, and will not, subject myself to the misrepresentation of the world. I loved—Sarah—as you know, with all my heart and soul. My object was the happiness of the woman that I loved. To promote that, I would have sacrificed myself—and almost my hope of heaven. She discarded me;—I use no disguise—no concealment to you, Sarah; because I would have you know my heart truly, and as it is. She discarded me—cut me adrift. Very well—I did not complain!... I do not... You knew her... You knew that she loved me, or, at least, that I had reason to believe so. Perhaps I was mistaken— what!—mistaken;—no—by heaven, I was not. She did love me!—she would have died for me. She--But no—no matter now. Very well. She discarded me. I felt sorry for it; chiefly, I do believe, for her sake; not, that I did not feel---aye, feel to the core of my heart, as if hot lead had been poured down my throat; but, it was her choice. I never complain. I only pray that it may prove to have been wise... I do sometimes pray, Sarah; and when I do, it is for her. May she be happy—All-righteous God-- fill her pure heart with comfort and consolation!---Make her happy. May she---never---never--yes, I can say even that, with sincerity and fervour, may she never repent of having abandoned me! May she find a truer, nobler heart: some one that has, at least, all my good qualities, and none of my bad ones---May she—But no! That is foolish. I merely desired to make you understand why I would not be silent or thoughtful---why I affected a gaiety, while my very heart was on fire;--why, when all is now so mortally cold, here---here, Sarah, that no green thing shall ever sprout here again:—it is, that I may not be thought broken in heart, or bowed in spirit. No!---let me die, if it be thy will, O my God---piecemeal. But let not that woman hear aught, or suspect aught of the cuase, to embitter her last moments.—No more!---The theme unmans me. I know not when I have written so much, or spoken so much, on this subject; but you have dared to look through my panoply---into my heart;---and beholding that, have shuddered,---and been just---nevertheless. I shall not forget it. I have a stubborn spirit; one that cannot sue for indulgence, but is thankful for justice; and, while it lives and breathes, will have it— and will not brook injustice. I have been unable to pursue your inquiry, as I wished. The weather has been exceedingly unfavourable, and all that I can hear is, that Molton and his half sister are occupying the old mansion at—on the Hill;--that they have still the same English servant, (but his livery is changed;)---and have given out that they shall neither give nor receive visits during the winter. Something is said about the death of a relation, as an excuse for this; and the sister has appeared once in black. It has been supposed, by some, that this solitary, and secluded life, has been adopted for purposes of economy. But I have good reason to know better;---my means of information may be depended upon:--they are confidential and not to be betrayed, but they are sufficient to justify me in saying, that economy is the least of their motives, for this abrupt abandonment of society. I have heard some whispering to-day, relative to her deportment at head quarters. The story has gained prodigiously, and assails me now at every corner, in a multitude of romantick and wonderful shapes. You shall be kept informed of all. John is bewitched, I believe. He has forgiven Molton the trick; for, indeed it deserves no better name, in getting the house; and has actually been closeted with him for some hours, and refuses to communicate with me. E Upon my word!---three whole pages!---the longest letter that ever I wrote in my life. Yours, my dear cousin, FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SAME TO SAME. The plot thickens upon us. John has just left me, and I must write you by this post. We have had the strangest conversation in the world. He is in love with Juliet!--- yes, truly, respectfully and tenderly. I am bound to believe him; he has come to me like a man, and told me so, I verily believe, the first moment that he knew it himself. I suspected Jane, for a while; but then, I thought that he had too much chivalry, in his disposition, for her. Are we alike, cousin? People say that we are; but it appears to me that we are not. And who shall judge? Strangers will see likenesses, a family likeness, between persons at first sight, who, to them that know both intimately, are totally unlike. May it not be so in the mind and character? I think that John has more real extravagance than I, and less that is artificial---more appearance and less reality, on many subjects; and I would have added, but for that last sentence, which, on looking at it again, has utterly discomfited me!---that I had more modesty! Mr. Arrinaut has been here, to call Molton to account. I wish you could hear John describe the meeting. It almost brought tears into my eyes. He was Molton's friend!---yes---can any thing under God's heaven, amaze you, now, Sarah?--After some conversation, in which Mr. Arrinaut lost all command of himself, while Molton maintained the most invincible composure, the former struck the latter. John immediately interfered---but what did Molton? He smiled. “Leave the room, my friend,” said he, to my brother; “leave me alone, with this madman:---I shall find a way to tame him.” My brother went out---but stood at the door. A singular altercation took place:---on one side a great deal of loud violence;--- on the other, the deep inward tranquillity of a hero--can he be a coward, Sarah?---but hear me through. All this appeared but to incense Mr. Arrinaut the more. He had given a blow---it had been endured---not a muscle stirred in defence; his lip only writhed and quivered, and his haughty blue eyes lighted up with a preter natural brightness---as if he had said---boy, you are no match for me, even in physical strength. Nay, Mr. Arrinaut had called him a coward, and a scoundrel. My brother heard it---his blood boiled, and he looked to see the glitter of some weapon. But no—there was only the glitter of the eye;---yet that was deadly. Molton smiled---and it was then, that my brother shut the door. The most provoking, insolent language was continued on the part of Mr. A. and endured by Molton, until my brother lost pall atience;---at this moment, just as he was on the point, (you know his impetuosity; and a legion of devils, at such a moment, would not frighten him)---of bursting open the door, cursing Molton to his head for a poltron, and perhaps throwing Mr. A. out of the window---he heard the names of Maria Howard, and Helen---somebody —(the last name he did not hear,) pronounced; and, the next moment, a loud shriek, and the sound of one dashed against the door where he stood.... He retreated, stunned, as it opened in his face, and saw a man stagger against the wall---his cravat stained and torn, and the blood gushing out of his mouth. Molton followed;---his hands all red—quivering like a young lion over his prey; and was only prevented from completing his work of death, by the interference of my brother. But how could he do this? you will ask.—So I asked John, but he could not answer me. Brother, said he—I would sooner encounter—anybody—anything—than Edward Molton, at such a moment. There was nothing human in his countenance. I had thought him feeble and sickly; but his arms were now bare—how, I know not— he was in his dressing gown when I left him; and his muscles looked as if they would burst through the skin. You know the size of Mr. A. yet he was dashed to the earth, by Molton, like an infant—senseless—blinded— and red with his own blood, as if a thunderbolt had struck him. It was half an hour, before he recovered— and, when he did, the first object that his dim eyes encountered, was the face of Molton, who stood over him, with his brow gathered, and arms folded, so full of mortal determination, that my brother expected him to fasten upon his victim's throat, at the first respiration. Verily, thought my brother, that man hath a devil. The poor fellow shut his eyes again, with a faint groan—shivered, and turned away his face. At this moment, Miss Howard entered the room;—but, so worn and wasted, that her own brother did not seem to know her..... She threw herself upon his bosom, and sobbed aloud. The sound of her voice appeared to affect him. His eyes lost their intentness of expression— his brow grew smoother;—he heaved a deep—deep sigh; his eye-lids quivered—his lips trembled, and he kissed her, murmuring in her ear, some low sounds of endearment, in a broken voice. “What did he, my brother?—what has he done to thee?” said she. “Helen—ha!—Mary;—forgive me, dear,” said Molton, as if recollecting himself instantly—“what done to me?—he profaned thy brother with a blow;—I bore it—he cursed him—I bore that—he called him coward--I bore that—but then, poor young man—he named thee, love, irreverently, and—and—there he lies.” His voice trembled, as he said this:—and John said that his countenance softened to a melancholy, beautiful gentleness, kinder than humanity—far kinder—and he added, “Mary, his punishment is with thee now. What shall be done to him?” “Forgive him,” she answered, putting her hand through his rich hair, and pulling his forehead to her lips—“forgive him, and let him go in peace.” “Forgive him!—never!—but he may go in peace.” “O, but thou wilt forgive him, dear”—said she;— “who could have resisted her?” said John. “No!” was the reply—“No! not if it were my own father; he has dishonoured thee, Hel—Mary.” She lifted herself up—raised her head from his bosom; looked him full in the face. “Brother—there is a promise—is it forgotten? I hoped never to claim it. I demand it now.” “Beware”—said he, solemnly. “No, Brother. Now is thy time of trial. Hast thou a great heart? Prove it. Go to the sick man—give him thy hand—say that thou forgivest him.” “I thought his spirit would rend his chest,” said John. He stopped. “Sister, you know not what you demand of me,” he said—drew one long breath, that you might have heard in the next room—and obeyed;—obeyed too, so magnificently! O, it was godlike!——he gave Mr. A. his hand—Nay, his eyes were wet; for his heart once touched, would have way. “I endured much from you, Sir,” he said, in a low voice; “and I could have endured anything—anything but that. Sleep quietly; you shall be taken care of, as my own brother; and, when you are well enough, I will convince you, that you deserved nothing less than death —death, here and hereafter, for your blasphemy—but you are too ill to converse.” Thus ended the affair. It occurred yesterday morning; and to-day Mr. A. set off for his farm in Virginia; and John says, that, when they parted, he and Molton, they embraced; and Mr. A. said—“Sir, you have forgiven me, but I shall never forgive myself. I did deserve death: and any man that ever says to me, of that woman, what I said to you, shall receive death at my own hands, or I will receive it at his.” There, cousin, I have related the whole, as nearly as I could, in John's own words; and, allowing all that I think right, for his extravagance, I cannot but add, that there has been something sublime in the carriage of Molton, on this occasion. What think you?.... Was it not, as John calls it, regal?.... He cut me to the heart in describing it. He cannot be a coward!—no! we are wrong. FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">E 2 ANSWER. No, I am not at all staggered, Frank. My opinion is unchanged. The only difference that I know is, that, at present, I believe Molton a more dangerous man than ever, because less feeble and effeminate. I have received both of your letters at once; and have read them with an eagerness that has left my heart palpitating so, that I can scarcely see what I am about. But let me answer them in the best way that I can. You have a noble heart, Frank; but, like your brother, you are disingenuous; not, to be sure, in the same way, but after a fashion of your own, that is almost as bad. However, as you have complimented my sagacity so handsomely, by this last reformation of yours, and become so suddenly, what I said you were, at heart, a man, I have some encouragement to proceed. And I shall proceed, cousin, unamiable as it is in a woman, to talk so authoritatively; and unwilling, as all men are, to see their dictatorship usurped—their prerogative encroached upon. Once for all, I would have you understand, that I respect you, now—and that I would rather commit a fault, by admonishing you too seriously, than that you should err for the want of that admonition. You speak of religion. I am glad of it; but I do not like the manner in which you speak of it. There is somewhat of your habitual levity in that part of your letter. Religion, my dear cousin, is not a thing to be lightly talked about; nor is that proud submission, which disdains to repine, under any calamitous dispensation of Providence; any bereavement; or any humiliation, at all worthy of the name that you have given it. It may be stoicism—it may be pagan greatness; but it is not resignation. Resignation is meek and lowly;—submissive and silent. No, Frank—if you have any respect for me, I pray you to think more seriously, when you mention aught of religious experience to me. I do not interdict the subject; by no means—I would rather invite your attention to it; for I know of no man, who would be a nobler ornament to any society of sincere believers, than you would be, were you vitally affected. You know that I care little for forms or ceremonies; but I look to hear men, and gentlemen, certainly, whether they be professing christians or not, speak of religion with less flippancy, than you sometimes do. And now, while I think of it, I beg the favour of you, to get a letter of your brother, which I wrote to him some weeks since, in which, in the distraction of my thought, (and wickedness of my heart—I may as well own it at once)—I am sure that I recommended the spilling of blood. Heaven forgive me! I have bitterly repented since, and I pray you so to inform your brother; telling him, at the same time, of my shame and contrition— and counselling him to forbear, if he cannot quite forgive the wretch. Nay—I have too much of natural infirmity about me yet, dear cousin, to trust myself with his name. In spite of my sorrow for what is past,—the thought of him sets every vein in my body tingling. Yet—what an escape I have had! Can I ever be sufficiently gratetful for it—a duel might have followed from my rashness. Yes, you are like your brother; worse in some points —better in others. And now, while it occurs to me, there is one point, in which I would recommend a little discipline. You are too passionately fond of poetry;— he of musick. By the way, that puts me in mind of our quarrel last summer. Have you forgotten what I told you of Byron's plagiarism. Do you remember what I showed you in Wordsworth, and Mrs. Radcliff, that he had stolen?—and when you quoted something of his, in prose, respecting “the mirror,” which is shivered—by something or other—in every piece of which, Memory, while looking down upon it, beholds the beloved image multiplied. I told you then, you know, that I had seen it somewhere, I was sure, notwithstanding his lordship's self complacency, where it is introduced—or the childish praise that I have seen lavished upon it. Well, some days since I met with it again; and copied it for you.— It is in the twenty-third letter of the New Heloise—and reads “Qu'on brise ce fidele miroir de Julie, sa pure image ne cessara de briller jusques la dernier frag ment,” &amp;c. Are you surprised at my avowing, that I have read this work of the “Divine Rousseau,” as he has been called?—“The apostle of affliction?” I hope that you are not. I read it deliberately, knowing its character.— And the result is not, what he so pleasantly predicted in his preface. I do not believe that I am yet, “une fille perdue!” Pardon my French. You know that I am not very ostentatious of such things. But, on this occasion I use it, as merely introductory to my opinion, which is deliberately and temperately formed,—that Jean Jacques Rousseau, is a fool. That is coarse language, Frank; but I do not shrink from discussion. The man's vanity has turned his head. There is one letter alone, in which his little knowledge of human nature, is made so shockingly evident, that we should never forgive it, in an ordinary writer. After Julia has resisted what, even to me, appears to have been much trial, and, perhaps, temptation—when all is passed—she deliberately invites her lover to her room. O, it is base and contemptible. No woman could have done it. A wanton would not. Nay, Julia herself, Rousseau's Julia, never would have done it. It was impossible. She resists when tempted;—but untempted—yields. Thus much for Rousseau. He is not merely a distempered madman. He is a fool. His angels are gross and sensual; he—But let us leave him— and go, as fast as possible, to what more deeply affects ourselves. This will be a long letter, cousin; I foresee that; but, be patient—what you get extra now, will leave you the less to receive hereafter. You are under a melancholy misapprehension respecting the woman of your love. You left her no choice, but that of forgiving you, when you appeared careless of her opinion; and did not seek to soothe or conciliate her--- and, consequently, of forgiving you at the expense of your esteem and respect:--or, of bidding you farewell. I am not at liberty to say more upon the subject. But of one thing I can venture to assure you. She loved you. And such women do not easily forget their love. Whether she ever felt aught of that passion before, you, perhaps, know better than I do; but I believe that she never did. If so, she will never forget you. I have heard a good deal of your conduct of late; you are wrong---I know your pride---it is unworthy of you; and, surely, you were never fitted to make so gentle and patient a creature as she is, happy, if you can so soon wear the semblance and bearing of a stern man. I know it all, Frank—you have met and passed her, even her, whom you so love yet, with a most unkind indifference. I know your reasons; some little civilities have been omitted by others; but are they a reason why you should wound her, so unfeelingly, even if she be with them. Frank, you have a noble heart; every body respects and admires you, for your bearing under this humiliation; and your magnanimity in confessing the fact, that she has abandoned and rejected you, looks well in the eyes of the world. But search your own heart---what was your true motive? Was there no selfishness, no affectation of doing what was difficult—no disdain of the world's opinion in it? Yes, Frank, I do believe you. I have no doubt that her happiness has been your chief aim; that you pray for it, now, devoutly. Let it continue to be so. Be a brother to her; watch over, pray for, guard her, while you have life in you. That you can do, and the time may come, when she will want such a brother. Nay, it will come. In the mean time, when you meet her, if you ever do, be gentle and kind in your deportment; let her not suppose that your tenderness and respect have turned to hostility, indifference, or contempt. No---I know you well, Frank; and I know that, when that face of yours looks sternest, there is a yielding and tender spirit at the heart, who would weep, were it gently bidden to, by the one it loved. Your duties are not, cannot be discharged, toward that woman, while it is possible for you to be of any use to her, in any way. Woman is naturally helpless and dependant; but she is especially so. Remember how she has loved you---your meetings---the bridge---the stump---the hill top ---the rock---all of which I remember, from hearing only faint allusions to them. Judge you, then, how her heart must thrill yet, when they are thought of. The secluded life of Molton, of which you speak, is strictly in character. The catastrophe is approaching; he knows it. We shall find him prepared. He will receive us at last, like the coiled serpent. Wo to the foot that would first crush him. Be it my fate;---I shall not shrink from it. The proof accumulates---the scene darkens---and we shall burst upon him, when he least expects it, with—Nay, I must not babble at this rate. I am now satisfied of one thing---and that is, of the identity of Mary Howord with Helen;—of course, then, she is not his half sister. But what is she? His mistress? For the honour of human nature, I hope not. O---if I might tell you all---but I cannot. Her family---her history---her name, and sorrows—they would bring tears into your eyes, but to hear the simplest relation of them. Can it be, that he was her betrayer? O righteous Heaven! when shall his course be arrested? When—no, no---in thine own good time---oh, our Father, wilt thou withhold thy pestilence, and turn back the destroyer! The whole of the interview, which you have so vividly described, is of a nature rather to astonish than to convince. It is possible that Molton may not be a dastard; but still it is equally possible that he is. The most pusillanimous animal will guard its young; and may not the coward, his mate? At any rate, it is, if not a sublime moderation ---sublime acting; and that, you know, I should look for, from him. Nay, such things are unnatural. They may be in nature, to be sure, but that does not make them natural. Farewell— SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO SARAH RAMSAY. My excellent Cousin, How thankful I am, for your sincerity and plainness, I will not attempt to say, just now; but, the best proof that I can possibly give you, of my sincerity, will be by my conduct. But let me answer your letter in detail; and the first thing that strikes me, is, (a rare fault in you,) a remark that is quite unintelligible. What do you mean by this--- “Such things are unnatural. They may be in nature, to be sure, but that does not make them natural.” I hope that you are not getting fond of paradox; but really, that looks not a little like it. Pray, is not that natural, of course, which nature produces? Don't forget to answer me. I hope, my good cousin, that, hereafter, I shall approach holy things more reverently; I would say, less “flippantly,” did it not look like resentment, to retort, even in a quotation, a word so emphatically used; and, I beg of you, hereafter, to continue the same friendly manner with me, when I approach them lightly; and rebuke me, as you have now. I shall be grateful for it; and, in time, may be nearer what you desire; at present, I do not attempt much; for another of your maxims is ringing in my ears; a maxim, the truth of which is confirmed by every day's experience; that is—that they, who attempt most, particularly in the way of reformation, often effect least. They think the work too easy...aim at too much...are easily discouraged, and become worse than ever. I have found it so. I saw John about the letter, which you so lament having written. He won't part with it; but, catching somewhat of my levity, (for, to all the world but you, Sarah, I am still the same frivolous, noisy blockhead, without heart or bitterness,)—he has endorsed your recantation upon the back. Nay, more—he has repeated the lesson to Molton; who with his own hand, wrote as much upon the back of your insulting note to him...adding a cold compliment, at the same time, to your consistency. Cousin, were you right in sending that note? was it prudent? was it like a Christian? You see that I have caught your own manner. And are you not a little too inveterate against him, wicked and vile as he undoubtedly is?— Nay, is not your asperity, your prejudice so great, that they blind you to some fine virtue in his character? You know that you are violent, and decided in your temper; and perhaps—perhaps, cousin, you have been precipitate in your opinions respecting him—some others, I mean, than those which relate to his personal courage. I only mention the thing. You will meditate for yourself; and determine, I am sure, when you do determine, generously. We will not dispute any more about poetry. I have been extravagant, I admit; but you perceive that I do not suffer any of that drunken exhilaration of the heart, which unfits a man for sober and substantial enjoyment. Poetry is to me, no longer, a madness; it is only a rich and beautiful halo, with which, when I please, I can invest what I will; and straightway, for my own entertainment, hear musick, and smell incense, and see moonlighted drapery, and feel the touch of soft lips, awhile, all about me;—having all my senses illuminated, hallowed, and purified, with vision, and lustre, and odour—without sensuality too. That is a bold decision. But I cannot help agreeing with you. The gentle and sweet Julia, with all her frailty, would never have been so desperate... but I am amazed to hear you speak upon such a subject. How dare you?...but no, there is no daring in it. The impurity must be in the mind. There can be no affinity, to be feared, between the pure in heart, and the pestilent vapour that issues from the alembick of Rousseau. It would, it must pass over the untainted and unsullied, like foul breath over christal. Still, my dear Sarah, I do not believe that it would be wise, in the present fashion of the world, for you to acknowledge that you had read La Nouvelle Heloise. Not that I would have you deny it; but it would be more prudent, I think, not to own it unnecessarily. By some, you are already thought a prude. They would rejoice to know that you had read and criticised that work, of all others. And men, my dear, who might not have wisdom enough to understand you; or magnanimity, or charity enough to allow your true motive, might easily insinuate some unkind thing; and unkind insinuations, however gently breathed at first, against a woman, soon become malicious and deadly. Few of us are so insignificant, as not to be capable of making any woman uneasy, for a time; and most of us rejoice in an opportunity. Sarah! I have read again, and again, what you have said of—of—no! I cannot write her name. It is too painful. I sometimes find myself, unconsciously, weaving the initials only together; and I awake, as from a trance, when the spell is completed, with a most distressing tightness at the heart, and my veins, about the forehead, throbbing with a painful heat and hurry—so!—never mind the name. I am wrong. I confess my fault. I will be kind to her, though they have been most unkind to me; for the memory of the past is here yet—the urn is shattered— true;—but the “scent of the roses will hang round it still.” Where, in the name of heaven, did you learn to touch, as you have, upon every successive spot, that had life in it, about this heart of mine? O, Sarah!—“that bridge—the rock—the wood—the hill!”—you know not what you have said! You have profaned; yes, you—you!—the holiest and greenest spot of all the wilderness, that she and I have ever met together in. There, went we together; sat together; leaning against the same tree, together; tasting, together, of the same spring; united in heart and spirit; or, as your favourite says—(It is wicked to quote poetry at such a moment—I confess; but, did you never laugh out, to keep yourself from crying?) “Congiunti eran gl' alberghi; “Ma più congiunti i cori: “Conforme era l' etate; “Ma'l pensier più conforme.” But I must quit the theme; it is too oppressive for me— another word, and my heart would run over. When you can, I pray you, let me know all that is proper and fair for you to communicate, respecting Helen. I begin to feel a strange interest about her. Am I right? Is there not a peculiar appetite for excitement, in the deserted heart? It appears to me, that I covet something, I know not what; but something, that I cannot do without, to occupy me inwardly, with that sweet delirium which—bless me, I am getting back to the old story again. Yet, one word I must put in, even upon the prohibited theme—it is this: I may burn incense to others—but it must be at other shrines, in other temples. She who trod mine, in her nakedness and beauty, hath departed—and no other shall ever stand where she stood. I owe that to her—that!—and it shall be paid. F Mais, après tout—ma cousine—ìl valait mieux, que dit le “fou” Rousseau—ìl valait mieux ne jamais goûter la félicité, que la gorûter, et la perdre! Adieu—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANSWER. Est-ce possible!—French and Italian in the same letter! at such a moment too, and from such a man!—Frank, I know not who is most to blame for it, you or I. I began, I believe; and you, I hope, have ended it; for, I confess, that you have made me heartily ashamed of it. How naturally we fall into such ridiculous pedantry. Now, that French sentence of yours, for example—why was it introduced? It certainly is not what you think, unless, indeed, you have amazingly changed since last June; for, on the third of that month, you say, “I am happier, even now, with the conviction of having been beloved by that woman, than I should be, in the possession of any other.” That sentiment came from your heart. But this, it came only from your pen. The lines from Tasso, are not worth repeating. I see no particular merit in them. They are often quoted; and I am quite sure by Rousseau himself; and, if I recollect right, he accompanies them with a most liberal translation, indeed. No, no, cousin; let us be superior to this kind of childish pedantry. If we cannot talk in English, let us, at least, quote aptly; and on befitting occasions. I have seen writers, and you can recall some at this moment, over whose pages we have laughed—spitefully enough, too, at times—who, evidently, kept a common place book, for scraps of stuff, in French, and Italian, and Spanish; and, when they wanted a quotation, turned to that, culled one, no matter what, so it was in a foreign language, and then fitted the incident or sentiment to the quotation. Nothing is easier. The difficulty lies, when one is talking or writing, naturally, to remember an apt illustration, to fit the subject—not in fitting the subject to the illustration. An ill-timed story is not worse than an ill-timed quotation, lugged in, by the head and shoulders, as it often is. Another thing: you are quite too fine, here and there, in your last. There is too much tinsel; too little heart, at times. Be more careful, for the future—or, rather, be less careful. Don't write for effect; don't study to captivate; and you will be much more likely to succeed. I hate antithesis—point—epigram—and dirty ostrich feathers—and they are the only four things, I believe, that I do hate. Oh—of the “unnatural things, produced by Nature. Set your heart at rest, cousin, I am right—and will convince you, in the morning; at present, I cannot. It is— or it wants only five minutes of twelve o'clock—of a Saturday night, too, and I cannot, will not encroach upon the Sabbath; (as we Christians call the first day.) Good night— Good morrow!— My proposition was, or, at least, may be resolved into this: that in nature, some things are found, that are not natural. Is this denied? Are monsters natural?—are the lame, and halt, and blind, natural? No!—they are exceptions to what is natural. Deformity and redundancy, are only so, by comparison with the general operation of nature. There is a general nature, and a particular nature. To be natural, we must resemble the former; not the latter; as a painter, or sculptor, studies the species, not the individual. Have I said enough? Yes, Frank, it is possible that I have not sought to cherish a truly christian spirit, toward Edward Molton; it is possible that I have judged him too harshly; but, nevertheless, I have every reason to believe, that he is a hypocrite, a dastard, and a villain. When I see good cause to change my opinion, depend upon it, that I shall rejoice to avow the change, as publickly as I have the opinion. 'Till then, I hope not to mention his name again. I have some things to repent of, bitterly and seriously, in which he was concerned; and, while I think no better of him, I think much worse of myself. And, as an especial favour, I beg of you not to mention any thing again, that, by any accident, you may chance to hear him say of me. I despise, I detest him, so heartily, that I cannot express to you, how humbled I feel, when I learn that he speaks of me. I am going into the country, for a week, where I hope to get permission.... But no, I will not excite your curiosity. Tell John to write me; and, if you please, you can direct your letters, for the next week, to — Post Office, care of —. Farewell—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANSWER—FRANK TO SARAH. Dear Sarah--- Allow me, while my very forehead reddens with shame, to confess the truth. That French sentence, I took from my common place book.... just in the way that you said; nay, that you may not think altogether better of me, than I deserve, that very quotation from Tasso, was taken from Rousseau, as you conjectured!—I happened to get it for the purpose of comparing Byron with the original; when these lines struck me, and I transcribed them; determined to introduce them, the very first decent opportunity, either in conversation, or writing. I am very busy, this morning, and should not have written you, even these few lines, were I not anxious to shew my contrition, as speedily as possible, for my folly. I am still occupied with my observations. John is strangely myterious of late. Something, I should imagine, had been cleared up, in that adventure of Juliet's; for he speaks openly, now, of his intention to win her, if he can. And I say, let him, if he can. I do not believe that she will be easily brought to love another.— But what do I say?—is she not exposed to incessant importunity; a secret and ever active influence?....and may she not yield at last? Cousin, I cannot reason upon the subject. But these, the following, are conclusions that I came to, when I was able to reason. If she marry another, she must either love him, or not love him. If she do not love him, she is base, or weak; and I shall never make myself unhappy about her. And, if she do love him, he will be either worthy of her, or not worthy of her. If worthy of her, then she will be happy, and that will make me happy. And if he be not—then she will prove herself to be not the woman that I took her for. Behold my conclusion! Oh, I must not forget to tell you, that John has just returned from Washington. He saw Mr. Arrinaut; and Molton has not a more devoted friend on earth. He said to my brother, as they parted, with tears in his eyes, “you have wronged Molton—we have all wronged him. He is an innocent man, so far as I am concerned; further than that, I have nothing to say. He has convinced me—and I take upon myself to say, that Miss Howard.... or Miss —, her real name, I am not permitted to tell, is a woman, fitted for the society of queens. My sister has been with her; and, I doubt not, is the wiser and better for it. My mother knows the whole—she has wept over the letters that Mr. Molton sent to her, for her own satisfaction—absolutely putting his life into her hands—and she now speaks of Miss Howard, as of a daughter.” Ever yours, cousin— FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO FRANK. We have, at last, determined to go through New England; and I am to be left, next summer, they tell me, somewhere in the District of Maine; what will become of me—heaven only knows. But I shall be among a host of relations, who, I am told, are the worthiest people in the world. Let this account for my levity, cousin, and apologise for the little that I have to say. Enclosed is the letter which led to the discovery of Helen. She was F 2 thought to be in America, but where, it was impossible to conjecture, as all traces of a lady, whom they supposed to be her, were lost in Richmond, Virginia. It was then that my father was written to; and his extensive correspondence was immediately brought in aid of the wretched parents. But all to no purpose, as a last expedient, the advertisement, which you saw, was written. That led to the very point, by a most lucky circumstance. You know, that all dead letters, as they are called, after some previous ceremonies, are sent to the general Post Office, and opened. One of the clerks, struck by the singular beauty of the writing in one, that he opened, read it; and, when he came to the bottom, found the initials H. W. O. He happened to recollect the advertisement, for he had pasted it up in the office; and, on comparing the whole, he felt himself justified in directing the letter, not to H. W. O. at the place where it was written, (the usual practice, when they apprehend it to be of importance,) but to my father.—He received it, and, sending immediately for the young man, (a most interesting fellow, too, as our fashionables say,) was confirmed, beyond all doubt, in the belief that Helen was the writer. The next thing was to ascertain where she was. The letter, as you perceive, was written in this city, but we were not satisfied with our inquiries here; and whether we should have ever fallen upon the right track, is very problematical, had I not seen the direction, one day, by chance, as my father was reading it again, and commending the style. Judge of my astonishment. I had heard of Molton's half sister; and I knew of a circumstance that seemed rather mysterious, if she were truly his half sister. So I wrote to Washington. The result you know. You may keep her letter till we meet. I am unwilling to trust it by mail, and I hope to see you soon. Mr. Marion (the youngster of whom I spoke,) appears greatly concerned in the affair; and a venerable old man has called, repeatedly, on my father, since I left the city. I am told, who is determined upon taking some serious measures. There is one thing certain: they say, that, if Molton be her betrayer, he is, actually, at this moment, holding his life at the mercy of the law. I should begin to pity him, sick and wasted as he is, were he anybody but Edward Molton, if I heard that he was arraigned for his life. It is even said—(but this in confidence, Frank, you understand me, and will have an interest in keeping it to yourself)—it is said that there was something inexplicable in the death of William.—Do you start!—And that —I tremble. Frank—and that an inquiry will yet be instituted. If so, let Molton beware! There is an inconceivable mysteriousness about all that concerns that man. Something has happened of late, to make me question my own knowledge of his affair with Juliet. His chaacter darkens, and she—she is mad, I verily believe; for, I have good reason to think, that she—let it not hurt you, my dear Frank, to hear it—that she loves him yet. Yes, I am aware of the contradiction; but hitherto I have been mistaken. SARAH. (The following was enclosed.) New-York, —. Well, Edward, to continue, where I left off; and this I hope will be the last of my journalizing. I like no place yet, so much as Richmond, after all. The people here, are pleasant; there is enough of parade, and uproar, to remind me of London;—much opulence, but it is all mercantile opulence; and the manners of the people are those of the newly made gentry. Here is none of that lofty, imposing, natural gentility, which I have seen at Richmond. The people of Virginia, to say the truth, are much more like our nobility, than any of their countrymen. Perhaps, we may attribute something of this to their slave population. They carry that air of dominion, like the still more southern planters, (which befits them, in a republican land, only when surrounded by their slaves,) into all the concerns of life. This I like, where I have seen it;—for there it was proper enough. How I should like the same lordly air, in New England, a nation of men, I do not pretend to say. But one thing you must have observed. It struck me at once. From Boston to Charleston, there is so much mannerism, that I think I could tell a Philadelphian, a Baltimorean, a New-Yorker, a Bostonian, a Virginian, or a Charleston man—by the very cut of his coat—or his walk,—and, certainly, by his pronunciation. A stranger would hardly believe this, yet the natives aver it; and the little experience that I have had, leaves me no reason to doubt it. Moreover, there is such an invincible nationality, if I may so express myself, in the people of each city, that their very opinions are peculiar and characteristick;— nay, their dwellings, their spirit of enterprize, commercial speculation, and literature are so. An amusing jealousy exists among them, too. They have a court language, of their own, in every state; and all that live out of the capital, are provincials, of course. Nay, the people seem to partake of the age and rank of their respective places of residence. A Philadelphian carries his nose above all the world,—except the New-Yorker.— One boasts of his literature; another of his great canal. A Bostonian talks about letting money at 5 per cent. interest;—India dock;—the “dome”—the Exchange;— Bunker's Hill;—Faneuil Hall, &amp;c. and fancies that all rivalry is presumptuous. The New-Yorker carries you over the CITY HALL;—talks of De Witt Clinton, and a superannuated old gentleman, to whom the Emperor of all the Russias has lately sent a ring;—lounges up broad-way, and swears that “that are is the capital of all North America.” But go to Philadelphia, and you are “done up” at once, with criticism, and taste, and science;—they make the handsomest gigs in the world—the best boots —and are the most regular bred people in the union;— have, what they call, the Water Works—(where a wooden image holds a wooden swan—through whose beak, a little squirt of water runs up, now and then, to the height of ten or a dozen feet,)—and a Masonick Hall, where there is a wooden Washington;—a picture gallery, among which is a picture by Mr. West,—the vilest thing that he has ever done, in my opinion,—where, after you have paid for admission, you are made to pay 12½ cents more, for a criticism, evidently written by somebody that never saw the picture. Next, you go to Baltimore, and there you find, among a people of adventurers, slave dealers, privateersmen, broken merchants, pirates, mail robbers, and rioters, the same ridiculous pretension, in another shape. In Baltimore, they do not value themselves for their literature, or age, or wealth; but for having shot General Ross, at North Point;—for having built two monuments—and several of the best privateers that ever infested the seas;—and for having grown up faster than any people, ever did; not even excepting those of St. Petersburg, when they exhausted the resources of the whole Russian Empire. Thus a Baltimorean comes from the “first city in the union;” he proves it by referring to the year 1752, when there were only three or four miserable hovels, where the city now stands,—and all their commerce was carried on by one or two fishing smacks. A Philadelphian proves, that he is from the “first city in the union,” by referring to the last census, where, it appears, that there were more cattle, within the liberties, than within those of any other city of the United States. A New-Yorker, to prove the right of his city to the first rank, refers to the next census. And a Bostonian, appeals to history, and shows that Boston is first, because oldest. And when you get to Charleston, you find the people there, affecting the same airs, on just about as rational grounds; one of which, if I am not mistaken, is the defence of Sullivan's Island,—forty or fifty years ago. But in Richmond, I have found nothing of this. The distinction that they seek, is one, that is perfectly evident, they have found,—from that air of self complacency—and negligent superciliousness, which characterise them. They affect to disdain all competition with the plebeians of the north;—commerce is beneath them; literature—O, it is all froth and flummery—except what is imported: though, perhaps, an occasional look into a Philadelphia publication, is taken, by way of seeing what the pleasant barbarians of the north are about. Shall I go on? I will, for one more page, and then, farewell forever, to this ungenerous return, for so much politeness and attention, as I, a stranger, have received from the people of all these cities. Yet—would you believe it. I am only repeating, what they say of each other! and what is believed too, by each, of all but themselves! I spoke of their character. I will give you an example or two. In Philadelphia there is all the cold, plodding, cautious deportment, of suspicious age, toward a stranger, even when well recommended. You deliver your letters—and are asked to call again—are told that the gentleman will be very glad to see you—at his counting room. He will be happy to see you, any where, but at his dinner table, or fireside. He is afraid of his daughters—or his spoons. Yet, after a time, strangers are delighted with the Philadelphians. They are sincere, cordial, and direct; well informed, polite, and sufficiently indulgent. But I never knew a stranger, of a few days, not superlatively introduced there, who did not curse them all, for a sordid, unfeeling, mercenary people. In New-York, there is a royal opulence, in their style of living; great warmth, approaching to imprudence, and very little discrimination, in their treatment of strangers. In Boston, it is much the same, provided one comes from England. There, he is feasted and feasted, and puffed, till he may literally eat his way, at the publick expense, from Dan to Beersheba. But in Baltimore,— they have all, or rather had, for they are beginning now to be cautious, having been cruelly bit by a few of our stray nobility—(by the way, remind me of this, when we meet, and I will relate some amusing anecdotes, in illustration of our impudence, and their credulity)—a most improvident warm-heartedness toward every thing in the shape of a stranger. Like people in their youth, full of youthful properties, unsuspicious, careless and noisy, the whole city is ringing, from one end to the other, if a stranger, of any notoriety—an elephant, or a nobleman—an American general, or a pair of mustachios—a brute, or a mountebank, appears—it is all the same to them—the dwellings are emptied, like the baby houses of children, and the streets are impassable till the raree-show has departed. You speak of their publick buildings. Some of them are beautiful, it must be confessed; but to hear the Americans talk about them, you would be led to believe that the seven wonders of the world, at least, were within the circumference of every city of the union. What is truly their own, is overlooked;—the thunder of their cataracts;—their rivers and mountains—unrivalled and unapproachable—are all forgotten, so laughably too, at times, that a friend of mine solemnly assures me, that, he lately had occasion to speak of the trembling, and continual noise, that appears to issue from the earth, and fill the whole sky, within two or three miles of Niagara, to a man who had grown old in its thunder and spray, who, he soon found, had never given himself any trouble about the cause of either; for he expressed some indignation, like one that resents an attempt to impose upon his credulity—when my friend informed him, that the rest of the world was silent and still,—that other lands neither shook nor sounded—and that other skies were as silent as these would be, if he should stop his ears. I have only a moment more—in which, if you are not already wearied to death, you may follow me, dear Edward, while I speak of the publick buildings. I will begin with Boston, because I begun there. There are some pretty churches; (including one that they mean to build, which is, already, the most beautiful building on paper, in the world)—and some about as grotesque and fantastick, clumsy things, as you can well imagine. [1] [1] Lately destroyed by fire. The Exchange is a noble building—hemmed in, and blocked up, by an encampment of printing offices, tailors' shops, and shoemakers. Then, there is a State House, a great clumsy, awkwardly contrived affair, perched on the top of a beautiful round hill, like a fat man on a feather bed; much too big for the hill; with the head and shoulders far too big for the body. The Mall is beautiful—and the stupendous undertaking which they are soon to begin, for connecting, with a solid block of masonry, a part of—Northampton, I believe, with west Boston, is, it is in vain to deny it—a—a—. They have a Court House, too, with a front of Chelmsford granite; and its wings askew, which I particularly admired, from the position, where I stood. The State Prison, at Charleston, is however, of a better character. There is no pretension to beauty; but it is a strong, dark, useful pile of building. Several dwelling houses are noble— one or two, (building near the State House) princely; and, taken together, I suspect that they are better built, and more comfortably arranged, than any others in this country. There are, also, four or five bridges, by which you enter the town; not one of which is even tolerable, as a matter of architecture. I must not forget the Mall, neither, as they call it, in a spirit of paltry imitation, together with their Park place, and Suffolk place, and Bowdoin square, and this court, and that court—all of which, I am already American enough, after breathing the air, for a few weeks, to despise very cordially. But the Mall, as a walk, not as a Mall, is unrivalled. At a distance, the town looks like an amphitheatre, with a great brick pile, whose disproportion is not to be discovered, then—crowning it, like a square of palaces. But the streets—O, it is in vain to think of describing them. No stranger should venture abroad, without a chart and pocket compass. A gentleman, whom I knew, assured me, with a face that I shall never forget, (a bystander would have thought that he was talking treason;) that, after twenty attempts, in as many different directions, to escape from an enclosure with a high brick wall, he was brought up, twenty times in succession, by the very place that he started from. It was a grave-yard. Every lane and alley, street and passage, seemed to terminate there, and only there. Start which way he would, east, west, north or south, the end of his walk was always the same high brick wall, with “the place of graves,” within it. Thus much for Boston.—But, when you get to New-York—(By the way, I have overlooked New Haven, and its churches and colleges; and Cambridge—all of which are exceedingly wonderful and imposing—to the inhabitants and professors,)—you find yourself arrested, in a noble street, by a truly magnificent building—the City Hall. It has two fronts; one of fine marble, and one of brown free stone!—You may judge of the effect, when you stand at the ends. There is a house in Boston, constructed in the same spirit of pleasantry. Approach it as you will, the front being of granite, you perceive the ends to be brick. That is a truly American spirit; showy and boastful, without propriety, fitness, or taste. But you can not approach even the City Hall, without perceiving somewhat more of the same spirit, in front;—for the enclosure there, is askew; so that you cannot enter it, and march directly up to the great steps. No; you must oblique and manœuvre, or you will never get there. I know of nothing else worth description. There are some paltry publick buildings, many handsome private houses, and a respectable penitentiary; (a matter of which the Americans seem especially jealous—and, toward which, they are often abundantly magnificent, perhaps with a presentiment like that of Swift, when he founded a madhouse, and made all things comfortable about it.) Well—we are now at Philadelphia. Of course, the Pennsylvania Bank is to be praised again; (for the United States' Bank is not yet thought of:)—no! for once I must disappoint you. I don't like it. It is too cold, formal, and quaker-like. We don't want Greek temples for banking houses. No—I do not like it. It wants that which gives a charm to every thing, and without which, the purest and most beautiful creations of genius, are base and inefficient;—it wants suitableness. The waterworks, of which you have heard so much, are paltry: the markets fine—particularly the butchers' division; but the market-houses, throughout the country, except in Boston, are contemptible. The Schuylkill bridge is a pretty affair enough; but you will be surprised, after all that you have heard of it, when you know of what it is built. Is it iron?—No! Stone?—No! What then? Deal boards and logs. There are some respectable private buildings, country seats, wire bridges, wire fences, and publick institutions; but nothing that I think worth troubling you about. We will now go to Baltimore, if you please. There you will find the handsomest, because the most appropriate, publick edifices in America. With the exception of the capitol at Washington, a magnificent pile of stone and marble—painted!—and a sweet, pretty church at Richmond, the description of which has gone the rounds of Europe, like a problem in geometry, defying all conjecture G as to its purpose; and the city hall in New-York; and—and—and—there is none so truly beautiful. — First, there is the Cathedral, a heavy pile of granite, somewhat after the fashion of St. Peter's; and the grandest building, of its dimensions, that I ever stood within: then, there is the Unitarian church, a piece of exquisite deception—manufactured of lime-stone, wooden-bronze, and pine-marble;—that is, without punning, or attempting to pun—plastered and stuccoed, till the eye is completely deceived into a notion that it is stone. Then, there is a pillar, which is (or will be,) a round, substantial affair of marble, called the Washington Monument. Edward, I must be serious here. I cannot write or speak the name of George Washington, without a contraction, and dilation of the heart, if I do it irreverently.— The pillar is grand—plain—substantial; and I like it better than I should, a work of ten thousand times more architectural merit. It is only wonderful to me, that a series of blundering, should have produced so simple and august a thought. But, I suppose that the building committee could not agree upon the ornamental part—like all who quarrel about matters of taste—and so, awarded such as they could agree upon; which was, naturally, the simplest proposition. But was it wise? Would it not have been better, had the money which this pillar has cost, been applied to some equally permanent, equally ornamental, and more useful purpose—such, for instance, as a hospital for the men of the revolution? Will not others look for the same reward?—and will not monuments, in time, become as common in America, as titles are, even now?—to say nothing of the ridiculous conceit of perpetuating the memory of George Washington by a work, that must crumble in a few centuries.... Why is it, Edward, that I never think of that man, without sitting more erect in my chair? When I was at home, I dreaded to approach him. I feared that I should find him, as I had others, who were called great. They were pyramids at a distance;—but, when I approached— I found them built of pebbles.—I came.—I stood upon his grave. I plucked off a branch from the dark cedars, that had sprung from it. Were they instinct with his spirit?—They had been nourished with his blood—and substance.—The thought makes me tremble. Some fancy possessed me. I went home, and bent one of the beautiful little branches into the form of a weeping willow—pasted it on paper, and painted the grave underneath it, with all the shadow and desolation of truth. God of heaven!—Edward—not a flower sprung there! What would I have given, for one blessed little violet, that had blossomed, perhaps, out of the moisture of the giant's heart!—Might it not be? He was gentle; and if warmth and richness of soil were enough, his tomb had been a heap of blossom and verdure—trodden and crushed incense and odour—. Farewell—my heart is too full for trifling, now—. Good night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(CONTINUED.) Morning.— As this letter is the last, probably, that I shall write in the form that you have directed, it would be a pity to seal it, without the improvement, as they call the application, or moral of a sermon, here, accompanying it, like a subtilely distilled essence, with which you can reanimate the earth that goes with it, whenever you please. The application, then, is,—is—really, I forget it entirely; let me go back, for a moment—. O—I have omitted, I see, to speak of several things worthy of a traveller's notice in Baltimore. There is the Exchange, the best contrived building, and, to my taste, more entirely beautiful, of the kind, than any that I have ever seen, except that at Berlin, (the new one, I mean.) Yet, here is the same base, showy spirit, of which I have before complained. It is plastered all over; and this plaster is cunningly managed, by the application of gray paint, to look like stone; nay, even the real stone about it, is painted. Upon my word, I should prefer the sober honesty of Dutch brick;—this is rouging, with a vengeance. The publick authorities, and publick edifices, paint and patch, and cheat; and how can they have the face to scold the women for such things? Another fault is, that, as you stand beneath the dome, you are immediately struck with a painful sense of instability in the pillars. They are massy—Dorick—and of beautiful Italian marble, imported with their capitals; but they rest upon the brick pavement. A slight expense would remedy this. Let a few bricks be taken up, and a frame of marble, of the same colour as the columns, be set in, even with the pavement, and the sensation would never return—at least to me; for, between ourselves, I shall, probably, never see it again. Another fault, I discovered. I am sure that it is one; the arch on the front side, as you stand in the centre of the building, facing the great entrance, goes beyond a semi-circle—and, unluckily, begins to contract, before it unites with the pillars; and then, it changes its direction. The sight was painful to me—and mine is not an experienced eye. There is a Medical College there, too, furnished, I am told, with the best philosophical apparatus, in the country. It may be so; but they are well supplied at Cambridge, and in Philadelphia. However, there is one thing, at which you will smile. At the Hospital, the students are set to studying—not morbid anatomy—O, no—that night shock and distress them—but dead people in wax work—.[2] [2] No longer so—finest collection, of morbid anatomy in the country, now.—Ed. There, Edward, I cannot go on—my travelling spirit —my familiar has departed. Have I not caught the true manner? Are not my decisions, just as off-hand and peremptory—my tone, as pert and arrogant, as would befit a publisher of travels. One of my countrymen, they say, here; and, really, I am ready to believe it, for no one has done justice to this noble, generous, boastful people, was once making a book, at the rate of one hundred miles a day. He came to a tavern. “Give me some bacon and eggs,” said he. “We have none.” “What—no bacon and eggs?” he repeated, whipped out his journal, and entered “No pork this side of the Alleganies; bacon and eggs, not to be had, for love or money.” Farewell; once more, farewell---of one thing, only, I can complain, in sincerity; and that is, of their too little republican plainness, among this people. They have too much deference for us; in fashion---opinion---literature and the arts. This should not be. In literature, they are our equals; (I speak of the present generation.) In arts, particularly that of painting, they are, abundantly, our superiours. And, in what others, have we a right to dispute? What do we know of musick, or architecture, or sculpture? Nothing---certainly, nothing of the latter, and not more than they do, of the former. Adieu, forever adieu, to journalising. W. H. O.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Midnight— How long it is, dear Sarah, since I have written to you! But you will forgive me, knowing, as you do, my propensity for doing such matters, by fits, and starts; beside, Frank has become your correspondent; and, I dare say, that you—no, I won't say what I was going to. It would have been affectation. I take it for granted, that my letters are acceptable to you; and that, when they are not, you will tell me so. Frank is another man, of late. He is strangely affected----with what, I know not; but he has grown very pale; and I find him constantly in company with a couple of strangers, an old man, and a young one, whose countenance has something very pleasant, though very fiery, in it; the manner of the old man is noble and erect; but he seems to be feeble, and, I should think, very sore at the heart. How is it, cousin? I ask you, because I have reason to believe, that you know them both. Did you not introduce them to Frank? Nay, I do not blame you. My numberless indiscretions have offended you; or is it because I am younger, a very little, by the way, though, than Frank---that you dared not trust to me?--- But, no matter. There is my hand. I forgive you. Your reasons are good, I am sure. Take your own good time to explain them; and believe, meanwhile, that your secret, though you dared not trust me with it, is safe. I know not if these men are watched; but I have some reason to suspect it; and, if you are any way concerned in the matter, you can apprise Frank of it. I cannot. We have quarrelled, lately, and I shall not be the first to advance. They never go out, I find, except after night; G 2 and then, with abundant caution, like conspirators.---- Nay, cousin, seriously, if you were not concerned in the affair; or, if I had met them alone, and seen their movement, such as I saw last night, when somebody followed me to my very door---stopped, when I stopped---retreated, and went on, just as I did, like the echo of my own footsteps---evidently, as I have reason to believe, while mistaking me for the younger of these two---I should inform the police, immediately, and have them both taken into custody. Juliet—(cousin, I feel a sense of suffocation now—but —it must come.) Juliet will not listen to me. I know not whom she loves;—but, be it whom it will,—it is a love that will carry her to her grave. It is unchangeable— immortal. Nay—more than this,—there is somewhat inexplicable in the deportment of Molton toward her. Am I his confidant? I believe that I am. At one time, I thought that I could read his heart. He appears to have no disguise. I am obliged to believe him; for there is no trick, no subterfuge, no artifice about him. If I ask him a question, he either answers it, at once; or says plainly, that he cannot, or will not. I find, too, that he has not been so intimate with her, as I supposed. Tell me, Sarah,—tell me, my dear cousin? Do you believe that it is Molton, whom she loves? Tell me plainly. I can bear it—I am sure I can. It may kill me in time; because, with him for a rival, I have no hope;—but it will not do it immediately. If she do not,—how is it, that his name—his very name, so agitates her? I have seen her colour to the eyes,—and then become so deathly pale, that I had not the strength to touch her—she was like a corpse—at the sound of his voice, as he passed, one day in the street. If I thought so—by heaven, I would blast him forever. What!—O, no—no—no! He is all that is noble. He is in my power, Sarah;—and I cannot use it ungently. But no—no!—I am the veriest blockhead in the world. Is not her emotion natural enough, when she hears the voice of her destroyer;—William, alas, thou wast dearly loved, too dearly perhaps, for thine own peace,—but who would not have died, as thou didst, to be so lamented!— You know that Maria or Mary Howard is not his sister. But do you know, who she is? It is in vain to conceal it any longer. Perhaps you know it all; for Frank did, I believe, as soon as it happened. I have determined to sound Molton's heart,—I have had a terrible suspicion sometimes,—but he is inaccessible to me. He only smiles, looks me in the face, and shakes his head—as much as to say; “Forbear—my heart has no door for the suspicious.” I speak of Juliet. He betrays no emotion. I even mention Helen;—the colour of his troubled blue eye deepens, but his voice changes not. Gracious heaven; what a woman she is;—so beautiful, so mournfully and touchingly beautiful!—O, I feel sometimes, when she sings, as if I could lay down my head in her lap, and weep there forever, at the sound of her voice; and then, her dark, lustrous eyes—at times they are fastened upon the face of Molton, as he sits by her, and reads—(O, would that you could hear him read—there is no musick like it—so impassioned—so solemn—so thrilling)—with an expression, that is—no, it is not love—it is not tenderness —it is something more terrible. At such moments, I knew not what to think of her. I am the only visiter. Nobody else is admitted; and I go there, I know not why, —perhaps, as I went to the dramas of Germany—to be agitated, and alarmed. Shall I ever be able to read his heart, as he does mine? I fear not!—yet he is but little older, a very little older than I am. Where has he learnt his art?—it is that of a long apprenticeship to — death, I was near saying—but, certainly, to calamity and trial; if not to somewhat yet more dreadful. Nothing seems to appal him. I have seen a pistol held to his breast— and the agitated finger of a man, choking with passion, was upon the trigger. Was he so well prepared for death? He smiled;—he never put out his hand,—he would'nt deign to put it aside from his heart;—and yet, upon my forehead, and I was only a spectator, the sweat stood in large drops. The same severe quiet spirit, he carries forever. He was riding through Connecticut, Helen says, not long since—when several good people came out against him, with staves, thinking to take him,—dead or alive, for riding on a Sunday. He smiled and suffered them to gather round, until they were ready to unharness his carriage; when he leisurely drew his pistol—looked to the priming;—“gentlemen,” said he, “you profess to be citizens; but my notion is that you are highwaymen, and I shall not consent to be stopped under such a pretence.” The good people instantly abandoned the horses, and took to their heels; but, willing to quicken their pace, Molton made deliberate aim at one of them, and shot away a part of his camblet cloak, in mere wantonness. The other day, too—but why recapitulate such things. He is a man of iron. He has none of the attributes of humanity. He is dying, I believe—but he forbids me to allude to it, or to observe it before Helen; for she appears to feel every change in him, like the touch of death upon her own heart. I have seen her faint away;—and lie, like a dead creature, for hours, when he happened to grow suddenly pale, and put his hand to his side. There is a ridiculous rumour about, which some experience of my own, makes me regard more seriously, than I would. It is said that the house is haunted!—and I am sure that I heard noises there (in the room too, where Molton sleeps, and where I used to sleep) last night,—that—I knew not why, affected me in an unaccountable manner. I felt as if somebody were near me * * * * ah—a groan * * * What! * * * * * * * * * It is Molton himself. * * * I went to the door, and spoke to him—but either his voice had changed, or I was more disturbed than I am willing to believe; for, when he replied, my terrour amounted almost to phrensy. The voice was not his. It was sepulchral. What could possess me?—I smote at the door—It yielded; and I fell at my full length.—The only thing, that I recollect, distinctly, is, that Molton stood, as if death struck—pale—ghostly pale, and shivering, with his arms outstretched, as I entered!--and that he exclaimed--or at least, the words rang in my affrighted ears, all night long-“William! William!” The light fell from his hand, and we lay together in darkness, till they came to relieve us.—How long we were so, I know not. But, it appears to me that we are all mad!—When I recovered, for I was stunned, I saw Molton sitting at his table—a naked sword lay upon it—and a pair of pistols.—Helen was sitting beside him, in her night dress, and clinging to him, O, with such distracted eyes, and bloodless lips, that my veins ran cold in looking at her. Molton never spoke nor moved. I waited like a culprit, willing to hear his voice:—and not daring to trust my own. But his brow was calm and immoveable, as the coldest marble. I was fain to begin—I faltered— I mentioned the sound, the groan—he awoke, all at once then. as from a trance. “I heard the same,” said he; “was that all! We are children, indeed. Good night, John”—I obeyed, like a child. I went, and left them together—I went to my bed; but I could not sleep.— All night long, I heard, as in the issuing air, whispers, and sobbing, as of some unhappy creature.—Do not laugh at me, Sarah—call these things childish or not, they are very terrible. Realities are not more so? Who does not suffer in his dreaming, more than he could, were he awake. Yet that is imaginary. But, O! how these pangs of the imagination, the spirit, how infinitely, they transcend, the gross corporal suffering of the body! Do you believe in spirits? Tell me, plainly. Doctor Johnson did—wiser men, and better men, still do. The belief is universal too, among islanders, holding no communication with the rest of the world? Whence is this, says Dr. Johnson, too; “they, who deny it by their words, confess it by their fears.”`How many serious, sensible persons are living now, who do believe—really believe, that they have seen a spirit. Allow all that you can for a weak imagination—deceit—falsehood, and our love of the marvellous, there are still some things, at the mention of which, the blood thrills. Do we not all believe more than we are willing to confess? If not—whence the painful interest, with which we sit and listen to the preternatural. Nay, whence the spirit that sets us exploring into mystery and horrour. If we were sure that there was nothing supernatural in either, we should disdain to enter their dominion. All people, ancient and modern, have believed in them. I need not mention the witch of Endor; the spirit that passed before him, the hair of whose body rose, and whose flesh crept thereat; nor the belief of the Jews, at the time of our Saviour, that evil spirits inhabited the bodies of men, and went forth at his bidding;—but I must remind you of the belief of his own disciples, who saw him after his resurection. They took him for his own spirit. It is no argument Sarah, that, being unsubstantial creatures, spirits, if they came to us, would be unseen, unheard, and unfelt.—That may all be, and yet a spirit might be as distinctly before us, as are the images of madness, or dreaming. Nay---do we not often feel, what is not---a ring upon the finger, after it is gone; pain even (as anatomists inform us) in a limb that we have lost?-- Do we not hear our name called in the woods; whispers in the wind?--And our sight and touch, how often are they deceived by optical delusion, and sleight of hand?--- we learn to distrust our senses, after repeated deception. Where then is there any difficulty in supposing, that a spirit may be manifest to us, by some correspondent deception? Sarah I feel strangely solemn, as I write this ---I feel as if I were appointed to plead it as a matter of truth and soberness; nay, is it not--in our sleep for instance? And why may not the death of a dear friend, afar off, be thus communicated, at the instant, to the surviver, if he be asleep? and if asleep, why not awake? There is no greater difficulty in it. He may be operated upon, when his eyes are shut, or made to believe that they are open. My opinion is—I cannot say that it is a belief yet— that such things are. The reason, I dare not tell; but something has happened to alarm me---and greatly, too. Adieu— JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO FRANK. My dear Cousin, Summon all your manhood, I have a secret to communicate; a matter of life and death, to you. I have made a discovery. Prepare yourself, my dear, dear Frank;— imagine the most distressing humiliation and disappointment to a proud nature, a nature like yours,—and be a man. Are you prepared? Listen! Juliet never loved you. The proofs are in my own possession. I have written to her, for her justification. In my opinion of her integrity, and beauty of heart, I have committed myself, all my judgment, and all my experience. I have been cruelly mistaken. I have helped to delude you, my gallant and good cousin; you, whom I so love—but, no, no; I will not weep. I loved Juliet, Frank; —I loved her. You know that. I loved her, with all my heart and soul—but—the thought chokes me—if she have trifled with you, I have done with her forever— forever and ever. I may always love her—but I shall never esteem her again. I have written to her—warmly, earnestly; but, I believe, not angrily;—beseeching her, on my knees, Frank, and in tears—(it is no figure of speech)—literally, on my knees, and in tears, to exculpate herself. I await her answer. I can forgive her, if she have abused my love—mocked at my judgment— bruised and broken—my—No, no!—I will not even write thus of her, till she be proved guilty, by her own sweet lips. O, Juliet! how I have loved thee! Come to me, dear—come to me!—let us weep in each other's arms. Restore thyself to my love and admiration, and I declare, that I will lie down and die, contented and alone.—O, Frank, tomorrow I shall know the truth—I expected her answer to-day:—yes!—and when the post arrived, and brought me no letter, I felt relieved by the disappointment; and have written to you, because I cannot, at once, communicate the tremendous certainty that I expect.— She never loved you;—of that, there is now, no longer, any doubt;—of that, I am certain. I only wait now, to learn that she has not dishonoured herself. If she have wilfully deceived thee, I shall never forgive her. I feel it, here—my resentments do not easily change, much as I have prayed that they might; and, if she have wilfully deceived thee, Frank, thou most generous man, I do fear that there will not be time enough left to me—for relenting. Even now, my cousin, now, while I am writing to thee, I feel as if the hand of death were upon me. Farewell...... O, Juliet! I wait her answer. In the meantime, be thou a man. Awake, Frank, awake!—it will be the better for thee.— Write to me immediately; I care not what: but write to me. Whatever it be, it will be welcome to me; for it is probable, very probable, that I shall be on my way to the north —I hope—never to return!—O, Juliet!— SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REPLY OF FRANK. Wednesday Night, —. I thank you, my noble cousin, I thank you. It is too true. “She never loved me.” I have just left her. My hand is unsteady. Enclosed, is her reply to you. She was very sick—but I have seen her. Yes! I have been at her side. What passed, I cannot tell thee—perhaps she has communicated it, in her letter. If not, it is a secret, and shall die with me. Do I feel any self-abasement?— No! Do I repine? No, no! God hath given me strength to face heavier trials than this. God hath dealt with me, mightily, before—and no mortal knew it. Nay, at this moment, I am more composed than—Her tears—her tenderness—her emotion at the bridge—the fountain—the hill—the rock—the stream!—O, who would not have been deceived, as I was.—We had visited them together. I knew not that they were already dear, so dear, so very dear to her:—and when I saw her there, again— traced her mysterious rambling to the same spot—surprised her, at last, in confusion and tears—O! how little thought I, that her trembling—her speechless supplication—her shame—were—not for me!—oh! not for me!—I cannot go on!—I know not what I write!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday Night, —. Yes, cousin—Juliet never loved me! But lest she may have forborne to tell thee so, and to justify herself, hear me bear witness in her behalf. She never wilfully deceived me. She is the noblest and best of all God's creatures. To the last drop of my heart's blood---to the last breath that I draw---I am devoted to her. Weak and timid as she appears, she is full of sublimity and heroism. I hope that she will tell thee all---O, I hope that she will; but no---I need not hope it. She will not.--- They happiness is not so mortally engaged, as mine. But take her assurance—believe her—trust thy soul to her. I know not how thou hast been deceived—but mine has been a delusion of my own. She was innocent, and her heart bled, when she saw it.—But, farewell. I cannot go on. A vessel is about to sail for France, next week. I have been down to secure a passage;---I am not yet successful: but if I should be, I shall depart. Let us correspond. I cannot live here any longer. Another country....another field....occupation, intense, incessant occupation only....can save me from—what?— from delirium....madness....suicide.—Tremble, Sarah, tremble. My hand has been already raised! What saved me? The Almighty struck it down! My brother stood suddenly before me. Whence he came, I knew not. It was like an apparition—we had quarrelled—and have been strangers for a month. He bore a billet from— yes, I will write her name once more—from Juliet! I copy it. The original I will never part with---it shall be soaked in my heart's blood first. A moment later, and this hand had been stiff! A moment later---oh! my brother!— my poor, generous brother!---how have I wronged thee.—Farewell. He has enclosed a letter also. I know not what it is. I care not. I only know, that I love you----all----all!----with unspeakable affection. Be kind to her, Sally---O, be kind to her! She was never so worthy of your love or veneration.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Copy of the Note.) My excellent Friend, As you are about to leave us for a long time; and, as it is highly probable that we shall never meet again, in this life, I have taken the liberty to address a few words H more to you, on the melancholy subject of our last conversation. I never wrote to a man, before; and, I trust, that you, who are now master of my motive, will not misjudge the action. I am in your power. I feel it, but I do not tremble; for, I am sure, that you are generous and noble. What was communicated to you, yesterday, I need not repeat, is of a nature never to be told, to any human being. This was my injunction, when we parted; it was the condition, under which, I committed myself to you. Allow me, now, to add a qualification. You are at liberty to tell all that I told you, to whomsoever you may think proper, when I am no more. Your silence will not be long. I do not say this to distress you. I do not say it with any feeling of levity, or unbelief:--- ah, no, my friend! but in the firm persuasion, that our good Father hath already bidden me to the chambers of death. It would be weak, if not wicked, to pretend that there is no terrour in this feeling. No, my friend, were it permitted to me to choose, I have yet so much the infirmity of woman about me, that I should cling to life; but still, as I am growing weaker and weaker, I feel that all the delicate fibres of my affection are gently and slowly loosening and detaching themselves, from the things of the earth; nay, from all that I have most loved here, and that they are continually losing somewhat of their vitality and attractiveness,---till I am brought to believe, now, that the time will come---(and the thought is painful)---when the tendrils, that a young heart puts forth too early, and too freely, embracing and intertwining with all that had warmth and affection in it, will become so deadened and seared, that they will be insonsible of the moment, the awful moment, when their hold is utterly gone and relinquished, forever and ever. Heaven prosper thee, my friend! Watch thy faculties. Remember thine accountability to thy Father, in heaven; and acknowledge it, by thy life. Farewell. While I live, my friend, my dear friend, I shall remember thy generosity and greatness, with the feeling of a sister. JULIET R. GRACIE. Mr. Francis Omar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(JOHN TO SARAH—ENCLOSED.) O, Sarah, what a brother I have. How little I have known him. The gay, unthinking young man—he is a hero. And Juliet too, what shall I say of her? Is it not strange that I never suspected the depth and devotion of Frank's attachment to her? He would never confess it and his general hilarity, his free bearing, before all women, deceived me. I thought, and we all thought, that he was invulnerable. Yes—that man loved her;—that man was worthy of her. What solemnity, what feeling! Indeed cousin, the tears, the steadiness of such men, men that are always cheerful and careless—oh, they have weight, and substance in them, like the smile of a man that smiles but seldom. I have seen men shed tears— tears like sweat—tears like molten lead—but never did I see such tears, as escaped from the eye-balls of my poor brother, when I handed her note to him. “Are you prepared,”—said I—as soon as I could speak;—for, when I entered the room, he was standing with his collar open—a—no, no—I cannot tell thee—pay no regard to what I have said, but listen— “Are you prepared, brother?” said I. He shuddered. I reached him the billet, saying emphatically, “Be prepared for the worst.” “I am,” said he, in a voice that went to my heart. I thought that I should never be able to speak again. At this moment, he shut his eyes, two or three times, quickly; a dark spasm passed over his face—, and a few drops, a very few, fell upon his naked arm. He started—shook them off as if the skies had rained blood upon him;—sat down;—read the note;—and, without uttering a single word, wrote a brief reply, which he read to me. I wondered at his composure. Once, only once, he faltered, like one suffocating, as he read it to me; but he instantly overcame it, and went on, in a stern, deep voice, like one reading his own death warrant—aloud—to his mortal enemy.—O what a heart he has!—so proud, so mighty. Why, really, it was our notion, because he was never melancholy, never absent, abstracted, or thoughtful, and always full of pleasantry, and frolick, that he had no feeling. No feeling! Heaven!—how we may be mistaken! Never have I seen a mortal man so convulsed and shattered by humiliation;—but it is over now, all over. He is a man again;—yet, how altered! His very countenance immoveable;—his deportment like one, who has nothing of humanity left to him;—no hope on earth—and no wish for heaven; doomed to live, and die, for them that he cannot love. Within four hours, has this change been wrought;—four hours, and his countenance is like something, upon which a stern sculptor has been at work, for that time. It is sublime,—and unchangeable, I am sure. He will go to France, and, I think it probable, to the peninsula; but for which party he will pluck the sword, I cannot imagine. He appears to have some scruples of conscience in the matter. Farewell— I hear him breathing frightfully loud, in his sleep—I must awaken him. * * * * *</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday Morning —. Ah, my poor brother!—another escape, another, almost miraculous. I have just left him—I have been with him all night long—I heard him breathing aloud, and left my letter unfinished, last night, to run into his chamber. I found him senseless—black in the face. It was with the greatest difficulty that we brought him to; but he has commanded my silence; forbidden me to mention it, even to the physician. But how could I obey him! I sent for our excellent Doctor. O, Sarah—this is the second of these fits. within the last twenty-four hours—the third will be fatal—my brother! my poor brother!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, 3 o'clock, P. M. He is better,—the vessel has gone; we shall have him for a few weeks longer, therefore, if his life be spared. In the mean time, he is resolved. Nobody,—not even his brother, I find, is to see the working of his heart. He is composed to-day; and there is a great serenity in his face, unlike anything that I ever have seen, in a living countenance, except in Molton's, once or twice;—such as I should look for, in one who had been familiar with death—for a long, long time, in his very presence chamber. It rebukes all familiarity, all sympathy. I dare not touch upon the theme. I fear that it would jar him to dissolution; but how mistaken I am. How inscrutable is the operation of such a mind, when the whirlwind hath passed over it, and it is literally upturned, with all its riches, and mystery, to the light. He speaks of her—firmly—unaffectedly;—but with a slight compression of the lip—and a deep and impressive solemnity; and he no longer weeps, but he prays for her.— I heard him last night, when he thought that I was asleep; and I thought that my heart would break. He had scarcely strength enough to arise from his bed; but he did arise, nevertheless, and poured out his devotion, with a fervour and inwardness, such as I never heard, from any human being before. He refuses all attendance; and we that watch him, have to do it by stealth;—he spurns all consolation too, as something idle and unnecessary. Good bye—enclosed is a letter, I think, in Juliet's hand writing. Brother, I believe, has a page or two, also ready for you; and, if he have strength, he will enclose them both in his. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO FRANK. There---no man on earth is so well entitled to the enclosed, as you. I know not whom she has so loved, but I have a fearful, harrowing conjecture. I am satisfied of her principle and purity, and am happy. We depart tomorrow for the north, and shall go first to Niagara. I shall endeavour to write to her, the dear sufferer, on the route, and shall direct, to your care. One word more. We were both deluded by the same appearances. That she had loved some person, I was sure; and, having no suspicion of any other than Frank, except in one case, and for a little time, although I knew all, I supposed, who H 2 have ever been suffered to approach her, I gradually yielded to the belief that it was he. What convinced me was, that she permitted your intimacy, after. I thought that she knew your sentiments. This was altogether so contrary to her general deportment, that I had no longer any doubt on the matter. But read her letter. There is her justification. Who can resist it; we have been mistaken, cruelly, I admit; but whom or what can we blame for it? Your delicacy, her unsuspicious, kind nature, or my rash judgment? Had you brought her sooner, directly to the point, we should all have been spared this shock; had she been less kind, more suspicious, or more vain, she would have taught you with her own lips, that you had nothing to hope, without subjecting you to the distress, that you experienced, when you were rejected; and, had she thought it possible that you would suppose yourself to be beloved by her, she would have poured out the last drop of blood from her innocent heart before she would have permitted yours to ache, under the delusion. But, heaven be thanked, our eyes are open at last, and we have now, only to tremble for—no, no, I cannot tell thee that, I am too hasty in my temper: and must watch it; beside, they tell me. (my enemies to be sure, but they are the right persons to go to, for the truth, sometimes) that I am arrogant, dictatorial. I believe them. I am sorry for it. I will be humbler. I have been I fear under a delusion.—I have been persuading myself that I was altogether a New England girl, sensible, firm and high, like my mother. But I am wrong, I was too young when we left New England, and the southern air has changed my original constitution. I do not resemble my mother. O cousin, it makes me very sad to think of her, and I really yearn to see the places, and breathe in the wind that she was familiar with at my age. Perhaps I may, after a time, deserve the name that you have sometimes given to me, of the downright yankee girl. Farewell, once more, dear Frank, farewell; and remember the words of Juliet, “think of thine accountability.--- Show thy sense of it, in thy life.” SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(JULIET TO SARAH, ENCLOSED.) Ah! Sarah!—you have cut me to the heart. I look back, my dear, unkind as you are, upon all your past affection, and endeavour to forget that you have doubted me; but what shall I say to you? how can I defend myself? I have only my simple word to offer, and it may be, that my word will be no longer enough to satisfy you. I must stop---I cannot go on.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evening.— I am much better, now, dear Sarah; and my heart, bleeding and exhausted as it is, hath forgiven you. At first, I was unable to answer you, at all—or, even to meditate upon the subject. Your anger was too suddenly announced, for my poor nerves—it fell upon them, like a clap of thunder. I have, always, been accustomed to indulgence and tenderness, as you know, my dear, rash friend; and, even where affliction hath, sometimes, laid her hand upon me, it hath always been with gentleness. Death came, too—but, there was little terrour in his aspect;—his countenance was mournful, and his tone, like that of a departed friendship, in our dreaming, was very pleasant, even while it made me weep. Judge, then, how little I was prepared for such a letter as yours. Sarah, I do not reproach you; I love you too much for that; but you may believe me, when I declare, that, I have never suffered so rude a pang, since my birth, as that letter caused me. But, it has given me courage; I am not long for this earth, my sweet friend;—another season of flowers, will find me, I am sure, beneath that beautiful tree, which I chose, long, long since, for my place of rest;—another year, and all my infirmities will be forgotten.—Why should I be angry, then? why should I forbear to do the little good, that is left to me? and how shall I best do it?— After much reflection, I have made up my mind to communicate a few thoughts, to my dear Sarah; thoughts that, if I had lived and been happy, from my natural timidity and unwillingness to give pain, even when my judgment approves of it, she would never have heard uttered with my lips. But it is better that she should hear them from mine, than from the harsher ones of the world. Sarah, you judge too precipitately. You deceive yourself; and mislead others. You are kind of heart, high of spirit, and truly pious; but your piety goes for nothing, beloved Sarah, where it interferes, directly, with either your head or heart.... Your temper, too, is violent, and unforgiving; not implacable, perhaps, but unforgiving. Remember these words. When I am gone, Sarah, they will be found true. I know that they look unkind; but, they are not so. I have often observed these faults in my friend. I could recall many illustrations; and cite many authorities, among them that best know you—but I prefer dealing more plainly. I prefer telling you, in the plainest possible words, my dear friend, of your besetting sins. And, having done that much, I will now proceed, as well as—a trembling hand—and eyes nearly blind with weeping, will permit, to answer your charges. Yes, Sarah, I have wept; for it is a constitutional weakness, of mine, to weep at unkindness, even when assured, by my own heart, that I do not merit it. But let me enter on my defence, as patiently and delicately as I can. You have been deceived, you say. I can believe it. I know your disposition too well, Sarah, to suppose that you would have wilfully contributed to the distress of Mr. Omar. But the question still recurs. By whom were you deceived? by what? Not by me.—I am sure that you will deliberately acquit me of that. Not, I hope, by any circumstances, that a little more charity, (it is a cruel thing, perhaps, to say this, Sarah, but it is exactly what I feel, at this moment,) and a little more caution in you, might not have explained, by some other hypothesis, at least as amiable, as that which was adopted by you. Did I ever manifest aught, in word or deed, Sarah, before you, resembling love for Frank Omar? —What, then, were the facts? But, let me begin with your earlier symptoms of precipitation in such matters. There was poor William. What made you imagine, for a time, that he was the legitimate and chosen lord of my affection? That you did, there can be no doubt, though you may have forgotten it now. What were the facts? The chief one, I am sure, was, my distress, my agony and delirium, at the time of his death. You thought, and so did others, many others, perhaps, after that mysterious event, that my heart was buried with him. Did you not? And, then, another suspicion arose. Why did you always couple the expression of your sympathy with me, with that of hatred and detestation of his destroyer. Nay, has not he, that same Molton, has he not been publickly called the destroyer of William and me? But how of me? The charge is terrible, let it bear what countenance it may. It implies, that I am either base, or dying; dishonoured by the love of him, that you believe to be a monster of perfidy and wickedness;---or, broken hearted, as the surviver of him, whom that cruel man sent, so unpreparedly, to his grave. On that point, you were mistaken---John was mistaken; Frank was mistaken. I never loved William, other than as I loved many, resembling him, in generosity and goodness. The next thought, the next Sarah, was for a moment, yet more frightful. You have not forgotten it;—you never can forget it. Do you remember my distress, my humiliation? And why were you troubled? Merely because I had known the man, before he went to Europe.— Merely, because you had heard of his standing by me, when I was at the instrument, and “reading my heart, with his arms folded.”—Was it prudent, dear, to infer so much, from the few incidents that came under your observation. Suppose that we did “walk together?” You knew that my health demanded some such exercise;—and who was better qualified to beguile the way, than one, whose extraordinary mind, and settled, unapproachable severity of deportment, left one nothing to apprehend from his conversation?—But why need I dwell on him. You have acknowledged your errour there, and I hasten to forget it. But all these things did not teach you the circumspection, that I have observed in your character on other occasions. You still believed that I had loved. Sarah!— I will not deny it—it is a thought too solemn for disavowal—too sweet for concealment. You were right—I have loved;—but further than that, I cannot go—not even to you. The object of that love—no, it was not love!—it was religion, life, idolatry;—judge then of its power and truth; it has brought me to the grave.—But the beloved one, you will never know. Perhaps—if the bashfulness of my very heart will permit it, perhaps I shall communicate it to Mr. Omar;—he is to be here, this evening; and I am endeavouring to prepare myself for the interview. How often—O! how often! have I hushed the thought, as it arose, and I felt my cheeks burn the while, that I was dear to that excellent, that noble young man. But it would come; it would, now and then, obtrude itself upon me when I was all alone; and I would determine to make myself understood. But how could I? His affection was so delicate, so profound; there was, I know not what, of reverence and awe, that I did not deserve to excite, and that I wondered to see in him, about all that he said or did, when I was near. My friends observed it; I was rallied about him; and, at last, I determined to treat him less cordially. It was a vain determination—he came—I refused to walk with him, as usual. He was hurt, cruelly hurt, at first, as I perceived; but the next moment his eyes lighted up—and I trembled for the inference that he would draw.—I went out again with him, rather than be left alone in his company, as I should undoubtedly have been, for it was, as you know, the well meant, but indelicate practice of my good aunt, in what she thought her impenetrable management on such an occasion; and rather than permit him to believe that I abstained from walking, for that reason, or that I felt less freedom than usual with him. We visited some spots that were dear to me; he was so silent that I forgot, utterly forgot, sometimes, that he was with me; and when the sound of his friendly, sweet voice, awoke me from my passionate reveries, it was only to make me ask my own heart why I had permitted myself to imagine so vain a thing, as that he loved me, on no better evidence, than such solicitude and watchfulness, as this. We returned, my spirits were much depressed--and, for the first time, I observed that his hand shook, and his lashes glittered, when we arrived at the gate.—He refused to go in. It was unusual with him? but still I thought little more of it until several days had passed, and the looks and manner of the family convinced me that they thought we had had some quarrel. I could not well abandon my walk. The season was tempting. The snow had just gone, and the tender green earth was just beginning to emit its own peculiar rich smell of invitation. I went alone I came to the top of the hill;—it was consecrate tome—there was one spot—one!—and, as I leaned against a slender tree there, and thought over the days of my untroubled innocence, the tears fell, all alone as I was, like rain upon the dry leaves below. Once, I remember, that I was startled, and I concealed myself, for I thought that some step was approaching. After this I descended. There was the very rock;—and, near it, rippled the cold clear stream, where—no, no—I cannot tell thee that. I took off my bonnet, I scooped up some water in my palm, and tasted it, as I would tears;—my eyes were turned toward a distant opening, where I could just distinguish a tree, beneath whose beautiful branches I had once set and listened, till my heart ran over;—there was the rock too—the turf seat—the pure water—the—No, no!—my limbs were too weak to support me, and I was blind with my tears. I heard a rustling near me—a faint whisper— something touched me—my blood thrilled—at such a moment!...in such a place!...O, I dared not look up!—I expected to encounter the only human being, whose presence there, would not have been profanation. But I did look up—it was not—no, it was not he—his portentous forehead—his uplifted eyes were afar off. No—it was Frank. I was glad to meet him;—ashamed and humbled as I was, at being caught in such a situation; I was so glad to feel him near me, for it was getting quite dim in the wood, and there was a long solitary road to be travelled homeward—that I believe—I—I was more than usually cordial, at least, I judged so, from the change that I perceived in him. His dark eyes glittered again; and there were instantaneous changes in his noble face, from red to pale, and pale to red, like the reflection of a passing sunset over a piece of statuary. Indeed he looked so handsome, and so happy, that I had not the heart to treat him coldly; and, if I had, what should I have been, but a capricious girl—a child—whose humours were not to be understood, even by herself? Suppose that he had asked me, why I had altered in my deportment?—or, as he once did?—if he had offended me?— what could I have said? Soon after this, I thought yet more seriously of the matter, and determined to bring him to an explanation. Yet that was not easily done. An honest woman, I thought, would spare him the humiliation of an avowal. True—but a modest one, would never suspect a passion, till it was declared. Nay, is it not a wise maxim to believe all the pretensions of a man, hollow or false—or at best, think of friendship only, until they are proved to be more serious? You can now judge of my perplexity. What was I to do? If I led him to an avowal, it must be by encouragement. But that would have been base, if I did not, as I certainly did not, mean to return his love. At last, our dear William was slain;—all the rest you are acquainted with;—my illness, distraction,—the subsequent kindness and attention of Mr. Omar, until he declared himself. Then, and then only, was it permitted to me, to deal frankly. I did so. I told him that we must part. This, I did, that I might not, unnecessarily wound him. Yet it would have been better, I now find, had I said, “as a friend, I shall always hold you dear;—but as a husband—I cannot think of you. I do not love you; I cannot love you—I never have loved you.” Yes, Sarah!—I ought to have said just those words; but what woman could have said them, to such a man? Ah, it is no light matter for the proud in heart, the good and the free spirited, to go with their offering to the feet of any woman, and have it un-accepted. I do not say rejected:—still less—do I say, trodden on, smiled at, and scorned—; as he would have thought that his was, had I so treated him. Need I say more, Sarah? Need I appeal to your knowledge of my whole life? Do I hurt you, dear, by refusing to communicate the whole?—ah!—the hour has come;—I hear his tread—his voice—he is ascending the stairs.—Farewell, for a few hours—Farewell!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Eleven o'clock, —. He is gone. It is nearly an hour since he left me. But it is only now that I have strength enough to draw myself to the table. He is an exalted young man, Sarah. I wish that I could love him. It would make me happy to reward such sublime devotion;—and, were it not, that I judge of another, as of myself; (and I should be unutterably miserable, were one, that I loved, to marry me, with aught but such love as I felt for him)—were it not for that, I should have been almost tempted to place my hands within his, while he sat by me,—fallen upon his noble bosom, and wept away the little life that I have left, upon the heart of a man that truly loved me. I was strongly tempted—moved—not with compassion alone, but with pride and admiration. But I forbore. Yet I did as much. What think you, it was? I communicated that to him, Sarah, which is unknown, and shall he, while I have life in me, to every other mortal, beneath the skies. I told him all—all!—my shame and horrour;—my humiliation, self abandonment; and— yes, I told him all. Was not that a proof of my reverence? It was. What I have not dared to whisper, even in my devotions; for God, I thought, must be jealous of the delirious and passionate love that I bore to one so little like Him—even that have I told Frank Omar, without concealment, reservation, or disguise. I am in his power: I glory in it. And now, Sarah, my beloved Sarah, farewell. Our future letters, at least on my side, I am sure, will be much shorter, than those that we have interchanged hitherto; and why should they not be? My breath is shorter; my slumbers lighter; and my poor thin hands; alas, Sarah, I am very weak and unwilling to go, after all—for a tear fell upon them, as I held them up, and saw how transparent they were—I am unaccountably affected at times; the veins in my forehead frighten me. They are much more like the delicate, faint wandering of blue stains in a flower leaf, as — ah —I had well nigh told his name —than ever—and I listen too, sometimes, to my own voice, till I tremble all over. It is strangely clear.— I Mournful, it may be; but, when it comes back to me, as it will sometimes, like a sweet bell tolling in the wind, O—I could go and make my own quiet grave, with my own hands, just where we parted last—we!—yes—and the violet should spring up where my first tears fell, when —no, no! no matter what—no matter who. It is all over. And then, too, there is an unnatural brightness in my eyes—they ache dismally—and there is a strange, uneasy throbbing at the ends of my fingers; and, altogether, what with the tender and incessant watchfulness, the very affectionate and delicate attention that I perceive increasing every hour,—with the carefulness to exclude every unpleasant sight and sound, from my dark chamber—their serious faces—the solemn whispering that I catch (for my hearing has become wonderfully acute of late) as my good doctor is continually arrested in the entry, by some one or other of the servants, or visiters;—I really have enough, I think, to authorize my saying, that, if you would see me alive, my dear, excellent Sarah, you will visit me immediately. If you should not be able, for I know well how you are situated, let us continue to correspond. While I have the strength to pray, I shall pray for you. Do the same for me, dear, will you? Stay, it is possible, dear Sarah; and, perhaps, I ought to say, probable, that I may never be able to write to thee again. If so—let this, my parting advice, be remembered. I adjure thee, solemnly, as a dying woman, Sarah, to wear, hereafter, a more humble and unpretending deportment; for thy sake, dear, I beseech this;—for thou art altogether more amiable, tender, and affectionate, than the world believes thee;—but, chiefly, do I pray it, for HIS sake, who hath endowed thee with such astonishing faculties, and will demand a sure and steadfast, and benignant application of them.—Piety, dear Sarah, true piety, is meek and lowly; yet sound and substantial. Farewell!—Nay—lest this may be my last letter, I will enclose a lock of my hair. You once thought it beautiful. There was another, one other, whose opinion was even dearer to me than thine;—he thought it beautiful, too:—ah!—dear Sarah—let it not shock thee. The touch is harsh now,—and I have tried, in vain, to restore the silkiness and lustre—the truth must be told—my hair is dead. Would he not be shocked at the sight? He would—I am sure that he would; for even I, fortified and prepared as I am, for the reception of my bridegroom—Death—even I, am utterly overcome by a little lifeless hair, which I have been twining here, for some minutes, about my finger, to see if artifice would give to it aught of that natural, undulating flexure, which was once its beauty and vitality—but no, no—it is dead; a part of me is already dead—and I—I can feel the remorseless influence coming nearer and nearer, every breath that I draw, to the fountain of my being, till all that hath greenness about it, is withering; and all that hath moisture, is drying up. A little longer—a very little longer, and thy poor troubled Juliet will be at rest. Be thou the guardian of her fame, than—thou, love!—and she will requite thee for it. O, if it be permitted—how tenderly watchful will she then be of thee—and of one other—whom heaven, forever, and ever, bless and protect.—Farewell, Sarah, Farewell!— Thine, forever and ever, JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN OMAR TO SARAH RAMSAY. By heaven, it is true. It is just as I feared. He, against whom we have plotted—he whom we had be set, like a wild beast, in the toils—he hath escaped. Escaped! Nay, that were a trifle; but we are now in his power. Frank has gone to the south. I am glad of it—glad; for some blood would be spilt, else. It is just as I feared. Do you not tremble, Sarah? Or, do you not anticipate the truth? Have you no chill?—no spasm at the heart? Molton is the man. Edward Molton—he, whom I could curse! I—I—I know not what I say. But he is the man that Juliet loves! How are you, now, Sarah? Hardly had we despatched the messenger to prevent your arrival, than I discovered the true cause of Juliet's resuscitation. Molton had seen her. It was only for a moment;—but, gracious heaven! her whole body was instinct with a new spirit. She never appeared so touchingly, so delicately beautiful. Her parted lips—her innocent, clear eyes— her sweet face, blushing through her tears—her agitation—oh! I could have fallen on my face, before her.— Yet, how did he behave?—Listen. It was described to me, by Frederica; but whether she suspected the truth, or not, it were impossible to say. She is too generous, however, to betray it, even if she did. And you, my dear cousin, you will guard it, as your own honour.— What an unaccountable creature he is—how immoveable—not a tear—not one—yet his chest heaved—and the blood settled in his eyes—and he staggered, when he touched her hand—yet, not a word—not a look—not a gesture—betrayed him. Once, while she was speaking to him, with that serious gentleness of her's, he held his breath so long, said Frederica, that I thought he would never breathe again. He stood before her, as she sat looking out of the window, like an apparition—uncovered—his eyes cast down, and his hair strangely disordered. She lifted her eyes—a faint cry escaped her—and she would have fallen, but for his encircling arms. Was she sensible of the touch? Her colour came and went, rapidly;—and, while his head was turned away, and the big sweat stood upon his lips, his very lips, Frederica says, that she saw Juliet open her eyes, with an expression so tender and happy, that—She stopped there. She was unwilling to betray her own opinion. They conversed for a few moments; and he appointed another hour to see her, when I am to be there, saying, as he departed, says Frederica, that “there was no hope for either.” What did he mean? I know not, but I am determined to be present, and understand the reason of his calling. Has he come to be forgiven for the—murder, shall I call it?—no!—it may not be the murder—of William? Or is it —my hand shakes with the thought—is it to disquiet a saint, in her last moments, with the remembrance of something, I know not what, but something, I am sure, of tremendous emphasis, in her recollection of the past? Adieu, till the interview is over!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evening.— I have just left Juliet. She is inconceivably better; but this often happens in the consumption. Hectick and delirium—delusion and brightness—are our ministering spirits, then. And we, perhaps, are never nearer our utter extinction, than when our eyes flame brightest, and our garlands emit the most of perfume. What an inexplicable creature is he!—and she too!—she is, alike, incapable of being understood. Where is her dread, now, of Molton? Why is he admitted? Does not her aunt remember him?—detest him? Or, is it only a last indulgence to the dying girl? Really, I wish that you were here; and I have half a mind to countermand the courier, notwithstanding your necessities, and the order of Juliet.—But stay—I am summoned. He is coming up the avenue; and I would be there to see the meeting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Twelve o'clock.— He has gone—gone!—and poor Juliet—alas!—I am in greater perplexity and consternation, than ever?— What has he done? What said to her? I heard all— saw all!—But there was some other meaning in it, than what I saw!—Else, why was she so affected?—by his first appearance, I mean; for she was calm, beautifully calm, after they had been alone. But that was the result...... Perhaps you can explain it. It is all a mystery to me. (A servant has just entered to say, that Juliet is in a sweet sleep. Thank God! thank God!) Listen, then, to what I saw. I can see them yet—hear their voices----her's, clear, and soft, and timid----his, deep and inward, as if his spirit were speaking, and not his lips. He entered. He was, evidently, prepared and sustained by some preternatural effort. He came---and his presence was unlike that of humanity. Was he death-struck? I know not---but his face was pallid---pallid!--- it was cadaverous!---quiet and established. I 2 He went directly up to poor Juliet, whose hand hung over the pillow, against which she was leaning; and, it was evident that she had not the power to lift it, for the effort was made:---it moved, but fell down again, like something lifeless, while she coloured, faintly. He took her hands, both of them, in his, with an air---ah! he must have been dear to her once, and must have known it--- “Assure yourself, Miss Gracie, my sweet friend,” said he, in a firm voice, “that”— She slowly lifted her meek eyes. He could not well bear it; for his manner was more hurried and tender, as he added---“Forgive me. I would have said Juliet, had I not feared to distress you.” Then, glancing his eye at Jane and myself, he added, “I feared, too, that it might be misunderstood.” She motioned, faintly, to him, to sit down; for, I had observed that her eyes, surcharged with moisture and glossiness, were perpetually stealing upward, as if in meditation, timid and wavering religious meditation, upon his face, while he stood over her. He did not observe it; or, at least, he did not betray his observation. He obeyed---he sat down---he still held her hand---he looked at it---his lips moved, as if he were talking to himself---a slight, tremulous motion, I thought, passed over his whole frame---it might have been mine own agitation, however, or that of the light; for my hand was resting on the table, and it shook. His face was solemn, tremendously solemn and desolate;---and once, when he drew a long breath, her hair stirred with it, and the strange spirituality of her form, awoke. I could have told her thought;—his, I am sure that I could. She was always transparent;—but he,---his countenance was marble and death---forever and ever---except at this moment. He put her hand to his side---her eyes were away---but I could perceive the same bashful consciousness under her thick lashes. It was done with an expression of pain, and soreness; and, from the look of his unchangeable eye, as it wandered over her temples, her hands, her attenuated form, at the same moment, I could have sworn, almost, that he was deliberately comparing his own situation with her's. What was the result? He replaced her hands---they were meekly crossed upon her lap;---and a smile, yes, a smile, the second that I ever saw, of the heart, in Molton's face, played all over it;---and the effect of that smile, so sweet, so melancholy, was such---you will hardly believe it---that my own eyes ached. I put up my hand to them---they were running over---I looked at Jane---the tears were there, too;---at Frederica---she was sobbing! “No---no!” said Juliet, “I cannot bear this!—Frederica, dear, reach me that book, and the little packet, there. Take them, Mr.—take them, Edward. But do not open them, yet. There will be a time”—(The smile returned, and he put his lips to her hand. Why did she permit it? Who ever dared as much before?--- Yet she, sweet saint, as if utterly forgetful of our presence, appeared to receive it as no profanation; but, rather, as her lawful and accustomed homage.) “When I am no more, Edward”---(I looked at him, as she said this;---there was no change, nor shadow of change, in his face; but his eyes were nearly shut---and his hands were locked, in the attitude of one listening to strange musick, issuing from his own heart.)---“then, you are at liberty to open it,” she added. “And not till then, Juliet.” “No!” “But, what if death should be nearer to me---than”— “What!” cried Juliet, in a tone of horrour—alarmed, it was evident, more by the look with which the words were spoken, than by the words themselves—“What mean you, Edward?”— “I mean—I know not what;—but it might happen, dear Juliet—it might happen, that one could foresee his own death.” Juliet raised her eyes in terrour---he was leaning toward her;---and I could see the blood rushing, hither and thither, about his temples, just as if forced there, by some fearful operation of the heart; as if it were pressed to suffocation, and discharging all its life, at once. She put her hand upon his forehead---“Edward Molton,” said she, in a tone so sweet, so solemn---oh! I never heard aught that resembled it, before---“Beware!—beware!— there is One who can read thy heart, and will requite thee for the thought that was there. Look up, Edward! I forgive thee! It may be, as thou sayest, my friend, that—that—Nay, I need not repeat it; but if it should be---which God, in his mercy, avert---then---then, Edward, the seal may be broken.” Molton arose. He took the papers---the book;---but his face was very stern, then---and there was one moment, a single moment, when I thought that he was about to dash the book upon the floor---his eyes lightened---but it was all over, instantly;---and he stood high and dark before her, as at first, and full of tremendous repose. “I must leave you,” he said, in a firm voice; “and, from the situation in which I now see you, it is probable that we shall never meet again---on this earth, Juliet;-----but —but—we shall meet, somewhere, sooner than they expect. Bear up, Juliet---the hour is approaching. Go blithely to thy chamber. I shall to mine. It has no terrour for me. The time will come---it will---when the horrible mystery shall be exposed to thee;---when— No! I must not trouble thee, woman!—Juliet!----my friend!---I must not trouble thee, at such an hour! Thou art prepared, I believe. Be so.---It befits thee well.---- Expect nothing---hope for nothing. Death is near thee, and they that would deceive thee, are crueller than death.” (I would have interfered here, but Juliet forbade it;---and Molton darkened all over, like a sorcerer, whose untimely spell is interrupted and broken, at the moment of its consummation.) “No, Juliet!—there is no help for thee. All that remains for thee, now, is to die—nobly and bravely. Linger a little while, and I shall set thee an example—ah! do not mistake me. I shall not do what thou dreadest. Look up!—look up, thou broken hearted woman!—and believe me—me;—hear me say, that the time shall come, when all that troubled thee, will have passed away; when all the darkness and mystery, which I would not, even to thy solicitation, put away, at our last interview, shall be no more;—and yet—believe me—Edward Molton will never repeat that, which thy poor heart now thrills at the recollection of.—Mourner!—Juliet!—farewell!” Juliet gasped for breath—extended her hand to him, with a smile of unutterable thankfulness. “Then,” said she, “I forgive thee. Thou art still the man, that I took thee for. Farewell—farewell, Edward! Repent, and be forgiven!” He dropped upon his knees—he pressed his lips to her hand—not, oh no! not with the look or attitude of love— no!—but with something holier, higher, purer—it was that of adoration—that, with which a martyr bows upon the Bible, for the last time. He was at the door. Her eyes were shut—her delicate lips just open—and he paused; for, like us, it was probable that he thought her patient spirit had flown!— He paused—she raised her hand lightly, with a motion that he understood—he!—for, in an instant, he was another man;—the tears rushed to his eyes—and he shivered from head to foot—as if his soul were rending itself away from her frail tenement. Leave us!—leave us, alone!” said he, hurriedly;—“it is only for a moment.” We glanced at Juliet—she signified her assent—and we departed. I was the last out; and, as I shut the door, I heard him say, “Are the letters all here?”—and she answered, inarticulately, “Yes!—it was for that, that I sent for you—it was dangerous.” He knelt by her, and, I thought, but I did not turn fully round to look, that his arms embraced her, and that her head was upon his shoulder. The conversation was low, and interrupted, I thought, by deep emotion, silence, and sobbing; and Jane says that she heard your name pronounced, more than once, in a tone of great earnestness, like displeasure:—nay, though I did not listen, I confess that I thought the same, once, and I distinctly heard Juliet say, that “She (but whether she were then speaking of you, or not, I cannot tell,) had a noble heart, and a tender one—capable of the most devout affection, and the most sublime sacrifice. Soon after this, Molton opened the door, and came out, and passed us, without appearing to see us—the same imperturbable solemnity in his face—the same regal carriage and movement of body. When we re-entered, we were both struck with an essential alteration in the countenance of Juliet. There was something in it—something that I never saw before, there;---something that I should have called pride, resentment, or indignation, in any other face; but I feared to think it so in her's. There was the appearance, too, and Jane called my attention to it, secretly; and when I looked, I observed that Juliet's eyes followed me—and, I thought, that she coloured and trembled—there was an appearance, too, in the ashes, as if paper, and a considerable quantity too, had just been burnt there:—nay, there were the leaves of a book, or my fancy deceived me, plainly to be seen, for some minutes after we entered. But, from this moment, Juliet's whole manner was changed. She was more serious---less pensive: more heroick and calm;—and I was with her for a whole hour. What am I to think of this? Can we doubt any longer who is the lord of her heart? It must be Molton---it is. And yet, we have been deceived before. Does she not know who his half sister is?---what her character is?--- and that he is, really and truly, the murderer of William?---that William whom she so loved? Let it have been done fairly, still it was murder in this terrible Molton; for William was a child, a mere child to him. He could not have injured a hair of Molton's head. Then why did he slay him? Ah! Sarah! it may be, that I have thought too well of Molton. What!---am I so base?--- this deadly infusion of envy and jealousy!---O, forgive me, heaven!---has this been able, so soon and so entirely, to corrupt my heart? What! shall I doubt Molton now, merely because I think Juliet loves him, when I have withstood all else?---prejudice, slander, and the influence of thy mortal hatred, Sarah? O! man, man! how base and earthly are thy judgments! No, Sarah---I will not desert this man. But give me to see his guilt---make it plain---and I will pursue him to the end of the earth.---- Yet, what is this, but seeking to gratify my own envy again? Ah! Sarah! I was not always so inveterate.---- There is some distemper in my heart---some disorder---I know not what;---but it has changed my nature. All is greenness and bitterness, where once—hell and fury! —should it not be green and bitter?---has not he plucked out, by the roots, the blessed image, that death could not have defaced there---dissolution and rottenness could not have corrupted! O, shame! shame!---these transports, how unworthy they are of me! No.---I will be his friend yet, in spite of my hatred and fear of him. I will go this day, this hour, and visit him as usual;---and wo to the hand that assails him, without the majesty of the law--- the law!---ha!—that reminds me of the two strangers —the—it may be—. But, tell me, Sarah, tell me. Can it be possible that Juliet loved Molton? Did he love her? if so, how could he have loved another?--- No!---he could not. He never loved her, then. But did she love him? Sarah, I dare not answer that question. I feel my bones quiver in their sockets. Can she have loved him?---and does she, after all? She knows that Helen is with him---I am sure of it. Can her spirit endure such contamination?---can it?---No! the touch of impurity would be death to it! Good night!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Morning.— I have kept this unsealed to the last moment. Juliet is perceptibly better. It is pride;---I am not afraid to say so, to-day;---It is pride---I am sure of it. She sits more erect;---there is less of that tenderness, that thrilling tenderness, in her tone---less languor and melancholy in her eyes;---there is even a dash of serious haughtiness. Heaven be praised! Do not inform Frank of this---do not, I beseech you. Adieu, JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH RAMSAY TO JOHN OMAR. I know not what to believe. She is too exalted, too pure of heart, I am sure, to permit any affection, there, for the dissolute, however specious they may be. But Molton—the remorseless villain; O, beware of him.---What tremendous apathy, is this? What unspeakable infatuation? Will you permit the serpent to enfold you all,—I know not how to express myself. I am troubled, almost to suffocation and blindness, at the thought of him. Would, that I had less sensibility; yet, why should I wish it? Would we pray for torpor, numbness, to escape the pains that accompany sensation? Are not even these pangs, these palpitations, these tears, these tears of scalding humiliation and self-abasement, which Juliet, the meekest creature upon this earth, has wrung from me, by her reproaches,—no, not by her reproaches. but by the kindest admonition, in the world; are they not better than insensibility? They are. We have our sense of suffering, and joy; of agony, and rapture; most exquisitely proportioned to each other. He, who has the least sensibility to pain, has the least to pleasure. Let us not lament, therefore, that our senses are not sealed up, our touch deadened, our ears stopped, our eyes shut, to the beauty and the harmony that surround us; because it may sometimes happen that, that harmony is too loud and frightful, or that beauty, too terrible. No; if insensibility were better than this nature, which is so delicately interwoven with all the crimson labyrinth of our blood, the ten thousand delicate fibres of our being, tangled, as they seem, wandering as they appear, without order, through all their offices and appointments; thrilling, to agony, when the finger of the Almighty hath touched one of them, in rebuke—sending his electricity through the whole web:—no, if insensibility were better than this state of exquisite being, death were the consummation of happiness. But what have I done?---fallen into the same errour, which I have so often reprimanded in you....fine writing....but no matter....it came, spontaneously from the heart; unstudied, unpremeditated---and, I trust, will so appear. But, let me return, for a moment, to Molton. My suspicions are all awake again. I have just arrived at the whole truth of an affair, which I once hinted at, in one of my earlier letters. I am now mistress of the whole, and I give you leave to take what steps you please, for your own satisfaction, in the case. If the stories be, as I have no reason to doubt that they are, irue, they, alone, will be sufficient to establish the deliberate and settled wickedness of Molton's character.—They are as follows. Let him reconcile them, if he can, to aught that is less than devilish. The disclosure is confidential from me. A strange accident brought me acquainted with the whole. I believe it; and, the only anxiety I have, now, is, to discover my anonymous correspondent, and ascertain in what country Molton was born. I used to think him an American; but I have many reasons to doubt that, of late. But, whoever it be, that gives me the information, that I now have, there can be no doubt of his sincerity and truth, for I hold his address, under seal, with permission to open it, whenever Molton can be fairly confronted with his accusers. When a mere boy, he was surprised, at noon day, attempting to enter a lady's bed chamber. She was much older than Molton, and knew so little of him, that she was willing to believe, whatever he would say, in palliation of his audacity. He told some story, I know not what, to a friend of her's, and she affected to believe him; but, it was only affectation. Her blood will run cold, to this hour, at the mention of his name. The next, is an affair, yet more atrocious. He was deeply indebted to a family, every member of which, had loved him, almost to veneration; and trusted to him, when he was friendless and alone. He felt grateful; and they, who knew him well, do say, that he would have died, at one time, to prove it. A beautiful little girl, a mere child, innocent and unsuspicious,---(Cousin, I know not what may be thought of this plain dealing with a man, on such a subject; but you know that I have been accustomed, from my earliest infancy, under the direction of my departed mother, to think, and speak too, at proper seasons, of many matters that seem to be prohibited to the women of the world. Yes, to them, that are to be wives and mothers, it is forbidden even to think of the sacredness and obligation of such offices!---I have been taught better. I have been made to understand, that the duties of marriage, and the education of children, are things of awful import and solemnity; involving all K that is religious and responsibe, happiness and virtue, life and immortality. But the fashion of the time is different; women are mothers, now, ere they have thought of infants, in any other way, than that of babies and dolls. Children are bearing children, educating children; and boys are fathers, nurturing spiritualities, ere they have learnt the commonest principles of self government. Cousin, forgive me---the subject is one, that will always carry me away with it; and I have touched on it now, that you may not be astonished at my using the freedom that I do, with a man, in communicating certain affairs, that relate to the arch imposter, Molton. I was proceeding to mention his unspeakble wickedness toward that child. She was the pride and darling of the family, to whom he was so deeply indebted;—and the chief sustenance of a widowed mother. Molton used all his power to corrupt that child, even in her blossom; —persevered for years, and finally went so far as to enter her room at night. The poor little creature was terrified almost out of her senses—shrieked; and, in her terrour, had so little suspicion of the truth, that when she encountered Molton, as she opened the door, she threw herself into his arms, for preservation. Heaven!—what was his heart made of, that it did'nt stop forever on the spot! Judge you, cousin, of that man's address. He was scarcely suspected, even by the child. Nothing of his whole life was known to resemble it; and even they, who felt some suspicion of the truth, had not the courage to whisper it to their dearest friend, still less to him. And such was his hardihood, that he spoke of the whole adventure, as of a dream;—and with such an air of innocence, that he was never asked to explain, why his door was left open, that night;—for he slept in a room near the child; and a servant, in passing by it, had observed her light flash in upon the opposite wall of his chamber; stopped, and found Molton's door ajar. The third case of this nature, now in my possession, (but I am assured that there are many more)—is the following. He met with a school girl of high enthusiasm, and promise. He was kind and friendly to her, speaking freely to her, of her inadvertencies, more like a brother, than aughte else;—and this, it would appear, is a common artifice of his; for, to such perfection has he carried it, that, while he censures and chides, there is a deep flattery in his manner, which he insinuates, like a poison, into the heart that listens to him. All speak of this—and all wonder how it happens, that they, who are rebuked by Molton, often feel proud of it, and colour with a pleasurable agitation. But I am in no such doubt. They are off their guard. He appears to them so frank and sincere, so incapable of flattery, that they rejoice to believe all that he says. And in all that he proffers in the way of admonition, there is forever somewhat which is racy and spicy, somewhat of that which all love, after having once tasted it, as the very aliment of their being. Another cause may be, that he never compliments one directly, and as if premeditatedly; but, always, as if by surprise;—as if he were taken, off his guard---and had spoken the whole truth, from his very heart, by accident, without intending it. Again—he never pays the compliment of his censure, to a fool; and, generally, it is apparent, that, in them, whom he most censures, he is most interested. And finally, all grant to him, a remarkable discrimination. He treats no two human creatures alike. By his very tone, look, and language, they, that know him well, can perceive the exact degree of estimation, in which he holds all that he has any knowledge of. I have wandered again, cousin; but, I hope, not widely from the subject. We will now return, if you please. After exciting some interest, it is said, in the heart of this unexperienced child, he went abroad, and did not see her again, until she was engaged to be married, to an excellent and altogether proper young man. He then visited her, again;—used all his art; attempted to poison her affection, excite her distrust, not of her lover, for that were a vulgar stratagem, but of herself. You smile; but so it was, and the poor girl was seriously indisposed, in consequence of the agitation, that he kept her in, by painting the disorder and agony that would follow her who married, without a certainty that she loved. But he failed. The destroyer was touched with the spear of Ithurial, and he stood suddenly, before that innocent creature, in all the terrour and hatefulness of his true proportions. I have finished for the present. It matters little what Molton may say about all this;---his word will not weigh with me. There is a deliberate baseness,—an essential, constitutional wickedness in his character, that would neutralize the fairest appearances, the most plausible tale in his favour, were he not, what I am assured that he has been, the greatest liar in the world. It is said, to be sure, that he is now as remarkable for his scrupulous regard to truth;—but I do not believe it. A habit of lying is not so easily, nor so soon overcome. It is one of the most inveterate that can be formed; and will always be seen in the shape of exaggeration, concealment, distortion, subterfuge, or duplicity, long and long after it has abandoned a more alarming countenance. The heart remains the same; and the mind is doubly dangerous. Tell our beloved Juliet, that I have cried over her dear letter, and the lock of hair, till my eyes are sore, and till there is a pulse all over my body. Your last intelligence was as welcome as unlooked for. It is possible---possible, dear John, that;—but no, I will not indulge a hope so desperate. I would have written to her, but we are to go away to-day---immediately, I find, instead of to-morrow. I shall write from the first room that I can sit down in, with any comfort. Farewell. Keep me informed of Frank---and BEWARE OF MOLTON. Let that ring in your ears, night and day. The two men---take care how you interfere. They are ministers, who are not to be thwarted. Beware!--- the blow is only suspended awhile;---but it will fall—it will!---Be discreet and silent. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JANE CARTER TO MATILDA. My dear Aunt, I should not have deserved your reproaches, I am sure, had I been left to the dictates of my own inclination; but so much sickness, so much mortification and disappointment; so much of, I know not what, have happened, to perplex and thwart me, that I am really sick at heart. O, I do wish you were here. How incensed you would be! Juliet is still the only subject of all the care, and all the tenderness of the house and neighbourhood. Nothing but “Juliet! poor Juliet,” is to be heard. If I want any thing done, the servant is in her chamber, or watching at her door. If I send my own girl on an errand, she is sure to loiter; and, when my patience is utterly exhausted, and I could sit down and cry with a good heart, home she comes with a malicious account of some stuff or other that she has heard about the sick baby. Indeed, aunt, I know not what restrains me; but the people here do act so like fools, that often and often, I am on the very point of telling them so, in plain English. It is just as you said, after all. I don't believe that the child is in any danger. To be sure, she looked very pale and thin, but she is quite too etherial to perish, to die—even with that most sentimental of all complaints, the consumption—O no, it would be quite too vulgar for Juliet R. Gracie to die, outright, like a common mortal; and it has often puzzled me, to conjecture how she is to be managed, when her time comes—will she pass off in a vapour—the exhalation of a dew-drop—a tear? ha! ha! ha! her lovers, I take it, would be confoundedly puzzled, since the doctrine of transmigration is done away with, and translation, and vanishing, and transfiguration, are gone by.—Shall she go like Numa?—Elijah?---or what? or whom?—the fools!— Indeed aunt, I had well nigh hinted it to her, in the presence of one of her fellows too, that she had gone quite far enough. The patient creature!—What think you she did—she opened her languishing dull eyes at me, with such a spiteful appearance of resignation, I declare that I was ready to laugh in her face. But what the men see in her, to do at on, and fuss about, as they do, I cannot imagine. There was your favorite Omar, this evening, on one side of her, with his mouth open; and that precious devil, Molton---Lord, I can't help laughing now---to see one of those chalk-faced puppets, in such K 2 a taking, with a fellow, that has debauched more women, than any other man of his age, in America. She pretends not to know this. But I know it, well;---and if John Omar were not such a fool, in this thing, I mean; for, in other matters, he seems not at all deficient, I would tell him the whole truth—but I dare not. I am afraid of him, now; for he knows, by some means or other, that it was by my management, that Molton was twice admitted.— Accursed folly, it was too, in me---the shock has only given new life to her! But for that!—no, aunt;---let us leave this subject, only I did not look for this result---I confess, in her weak state. I want your advice. What is to be done with her? She will get well again, I am sure, if it be only, saint as she is, to plague and torment me, into a consumption. Alas aunt, I know not where to look, or whom to call my friend. All that loved me, Juliet has enticed away. I am nothing, absolutely nothing now, in the house of my own father. Nay, I had not an evil spirit; I wished her well, I am sure, till many days of intolerable humiliation, and many and many a night of shame and sleeplessness; till out of them, a devil had birth. Sometimes I am sorry for it. Sometimes, I could lie down and weep —nay, go down on my knees before Juliet herself; and—what!—I!—I!—I kneel to that child! a pennyless, wretched, sick, helpless child; an orphan, destitute and houseless, but for the foolish compassion of my foolish father!—to her, who has thwarted all my schemes of happiness in life—soured all hearts against me; turned love into a poison, and friendship into hatred! But for her, I might have been a wife, a mother!—blessed God! a mother!—with my own babe, naked and beautiful, nestling in my bosom; beloved and respected by all the world. But for her—her!--accursed be that witchery which has impoisoned and alienated all that loved me— but for her, I might have been the wife of—thou knowest whom, aunt; but now, oh my heart will burst and shiver at the thought—all is not yet known—it may be—it will be, perhaps—pity me then, pity me aunt, if there be any thing of humanity left in thee—yea, thou wilt pity me. But for her, too, I had been the friend, the bosom friend, of that haughty, cold, implacable yankee girl— that Sarah Ramsay. But what am I, now? Shunned, hated —not absolutely, despised—Oh, no!—that they hav'nt the courage to express;—nay, nor to feel. They dare not —cannot despise me. Yet she pretends to piety—she! to piety. What shall I do? Really, aunt, there are terrible thoughts in my heart at times. Come to me. I never wanted your assistance so much. This step-mother of mine is a good natured idiot;—doatingly fond, as she is of her neice, she has such a clumsy way of showing it, that, I am sure, Julict is oftener distressed than relieved, by her manifestation of it. Let us reason for a moment. Suppose Juliet should die. Then it is highly probable, with my fortune, and the remains of what, you know to have been a remarkable fine person, and countenance,—that I may regain the elevation, which I have lost, by the continual sickness of my family, and the perpetual contrast, of my showy manner, with the quiet, sweet, obedient, and domestick habit of Juliet. I am not made for the fire-place. She is. I would to the saddle, if I might; but as that would not be permitted, in the way I wish, in tilt or tournament,—I must abide by such distinction as is accessible to me. If I cannot command armies,—I can give laws to fashion. If I cannot be the champion of our rights, in the Senate Chamber,—I can, in the ball room. If I cannot cry to horse! to horse!—I can call for, hob or nob, and “money in both pockets.” But suppose that she should recover. This, I expect;—not, because there is any such opinion here; no—but simply because that would be just exactly the awkwardest, and most unpleasant thing in the world for me. For this reason, I look upon it as a matter of certainty. Well then, we are to suppose that she is well. What will she do? If she would marry— marry any body, I don't care whom—she might have her choice of all the world;—there would be enough left for me—after she was served. You see how humble I am. My tears scald me while I write—but my lips smile—I can feel them smile, as if they were convulsed and writhing—. Well—if she will marry, all will go right. I will live and die, on the civilest terms in the world with her; send her my cards regularly; and take her's in return—go to her christenings, and let her come to— no, the thought is frightful to me—But I will go to her funeral, with the best bred air in the world. But suppose that she won't marry. What shall we do then? You know her art. Under that appearance of meekness and gentleness, she has a devil of a temper, when roused. Mine, aunt, mine itself, is less terrible. I've seen it up once, only once;—her eyes flashed fire, and Molton stood quaking before her, as if blasted to the very heart, by the brightness that issued from her. The fool!—she was in his power—and he forbore to use it. He trembled—yea—Ned Molton, Ned Molton himself, trembled and wept—ah—a thought strikes me. She loves him yet. Juliet, beware!—he is no trifler a second time. Yes—aunt—yes!—I want none of your counsel now, my mind is made up. Juliet shall marry somebody;—she shall; or, she shall go to her grave dishonoured. There—I have told the secret now. The horrour with which my heart laboured, is before thee. I am tranquil now. Ah!——it grew suddenly dark, just then— and I stopped. Was the moon in travail, aunt? Did some spectre pass between me, and the light, just then? Or was it—poh, poh—it was---it was merely my own blood that blinded me, as it arose and boiled—I feel it retreating again, and my temples are easier, and I see perfectly clear again, now. Farewell, JANE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MAD. MATILDA TO JANE. Jane, are you mad? What a risk you have run! Your letter came to me, unsealed! What miracle has preserved you, I know not; but all my examination satisfies me, that there has been no time here, for it to be read in the office. Do you make some inquiries there. Do be more careful. Your passions will destroy you. I must see you—I must, you say. There is a meaning in your letter, that freezes my blood. Beware!—Hold your hand. Stir not, to the right nor to the left, 'till I am by your side. You are on a precipice. A single step may shatter you, everlastingly. But stop—that is dangerous to write about. Your thought, fairly carried into execution, may prevail. She must be married. She shall be. Many reasons conspire to render it indispensable. The expense of her maintenance—the sympathy that she excites—the necessity that there is, of disguising our hostility toward her;—and yet, poor innocent, I could almost weep, when I think of her. But no, it must not be. It is too late to relent, now. She must be sacrificed. She must; for, if you live together, Jane, it is in vain to disguise it; she will keep all the men, that are worth a thought, in a state of perpetual hope and anxiety about her; and you will be overlooked, except, (where captivation is only for an hour,) in the fashionable world. Indeed, the more that I think of it, the better I am pleased. There is a man, too, exactly in the humour, for our purpose. Do you remember Grenville? He still thinks of Juliet; and you know that, but for Molton, she would probably have given herself up to him. I think that I can manage the matter here. I am his confidant; and if we can compel Juliet to marry him, what harm will be done? She will get a tight young fellow, with a plenty of cash, a good heart, and a good profession. Yours, my dear niece, M——. P. S.—Don't forget to seal your answer. O—by the way, you are under a mistake; Miss Ramsay is not a yankee girl. She has only the yankee temper, with a little southern heat, superadded. Her mother, however, was altogether a female yankee—cold, insensible, handsome, and sober.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. I cannot reply to your kind letter as it deserves—for, just at this time, I happen to be very busy; but, in a brief way, I will try to answer some of your enquiries. What do I think of our literary journals, authors, reviews, and editors?—you say; and what are they about? In answer, I say, that by and by, I shall enter more at large, into their characters. At present, I can only relieve you, by saying, in general terms, that they are a cowardly, mercenary set. Not one in a hundred of them, has the courage to take a decided stand, in pronouncing any judgment. They content themselves—and by they, I mean now, such men as “Robert Walsh, junior, Esquire;” they content themselves in retailing the imported literature, and the imported criticism too—would you believe it? of your unprincipled journals. Even he, who has the impudence to set himself up, as one of the guardians of American literature, as one of them, to whom it is authorized to look up for countenance and protection, is consuming his strength, in the manufacture of a daily paper; and in the monthly compilation of a museum, made up, God help our patience! of the refuse haberdashery of Great Britain.—O, that such men, with the present editor of the North American Review at their head, were, for a little time, held up to the indignant rebuke of the American people, as they deserve! What do they pretend to do? What have they undertaken? And what have they done? What have we permitted them to do? —Stafford, my blood is all in a tingle, at the thought of their presumption, and our abjectness. I tremble, all over, when I think of what they have dared to undertake, and dared, in the desperation of their audacity, to do.— But, I am ashamed, and could weep, for vexation, to think how tamely a great people have submitted, to whatever they have chosen to do, with them, and for them.— Robert Walsh, for example, is put, by his friends, in the first rank of native criticks. The others publish, what they call a North American Review. But of whom do they write—for whom?—Not of Americans—not for Americans. They abound, chiefly, in original reviews of works that are forgotten, merely, because it is the fashion at Edinburgh, and London, to deny our erudition;—and to be very pedantick, where there is the least danger of exposure or contradiction; or they, now and then, enter the lists with the English and Scotch reviewers, in praise of some poem or novel of the day—published in your country, not in ours—which never makes its appearance here, or perishes in the first edition—and then fancy that they are establishing the reputation of American literature!---Blockheads---what care we for the present race of English writers? Are our reviews to be made upon that side of the atlantic, and republished, under the title of Walsh's Museum?---Or, as in the North American, are they to be confined to the works of another people; and now and then, as it will sometimes happen, of a native writer, after they have been amazed at meeting with his name in some European journal. There was Brockden Brown, for example--- and the Federalist. Our American reviewers took up the cudgels in their favour, most gallantly---but when? how?---when there were no longer any body to contradict them; when there was nothing to apprehend---and when it would have been infamy, to forbear.---Stafford, I am an American---I glory in the name. Were I an Englishman, I should glory in the name of an Englishman. But then, as now, I should lift up my voice, in unqualified denunciation of such conduct in my countrymen. What!---shall these men be paid, by our best people, for a continual violation of their duty, their avowed duty?--- Shall they be permitted to transgress forever? to set their very title page at naught? to sneak away from all accountability? to lie by, and cower, and skulk, under one pretence and another, when a new American work appears? to shuffle away from a decided opinion, on any American work, until the publick have pronounced their judgment? No Stafford! I say this—and, Englishman as you are, you cannot but agree with me. I say that it is the duty of an American reviewer to take some notice—long or short—for, or against—every work that appears. If he cannot do it himself—let him get somebody else—or abandon the name of an American reviewer. And I say that, to nothing but cowardice or incapacity, should a failure to do so, be attributed. Can you wonder at my warmth. Our press, young as it is, abounds in the bright prodigal issue of authors, that only want to be taken notice of, to become competitors with the best and proudest of yours. You smile—I can forgive you—for one who has been accustomed, as every American of my age has, for twenty years past, to the more insulting doubt of his own countrymen, cannot be angry with a foreigner, for doubting that we have common sense. Take up one of our last numbers of the North American—or the Museum—or Port Folio—another paltry counterfeit. Look at them. What do you find in them? Remember that they are American publications, professedly written, or compiled by Americans, in the hope of advancing the reputation of the country! Heaven, what a bitter sarcasm upon our quackery and pretension; our yankee tricks—and all our honesty and intellect, are the mere title pages. One, you will find made up from Campbell's cast-off Magazines—and the newspapers of the day;—another of stupid reviews—stupidly remodelled —the other, a body of prize essays, written, one would be tempted to think, to prove to the people abroad, that, barbarians, as we are—we are able to translate the title pages of very learned works, in Italian, French, German and Latin;—but let me explain myself. First you come upon a review of somebody—an Italian;—whose name it may be, that the editor of the North American— while upon his travels in Greece—without an allusion to which, he cannot blow his nose—happened to hear. The title page, of course, is given to you in Italian. The next will be a mass of erudition—having about enough to do with the subject, to make you believe it a transcript of some student's common place book—diligently copied, and adroitly tacked together—probably with a running title in German or French. Pshaw—I have not patience with such foppery. If we are ever to obtain a literary character, it must be by a bold, high handed carriage of ourselves. The Scotch have been trodden into coalition—like muscles in the mud;—and, after a time, if kicks and cuffs won't do, we may have the same good luck. But, by the way, I would not have you utterly misunderstand our literary character. The North American Review, as it is now called (in derision, one would think) is no longer what it has been. Time was, when the hands of mighty men were to be seen, even in the clumsiest of its decorations. It has been (if you will allow me to amuse myself for a moment) a great Banking House—a Treasury—where you were sure to find ore, and ingots—and bars, though the former might not always have been purified, nor the two latter coined or stamped. Then there were the most powerful, rich, and beautiful issues from it, whenever the pressure was greatest. It could have withstood then, the run of all North America. But how is it now? Not much unlike the Bank of Amsterdam, after the eruption of Napoleon —a place of subterranean darkness and emptiness: a place of discount and deposit for bad paper (which were better fitted for any other place of deposit)—drawn by bankrupts —who live by overdrawing—countersigned by Mr. Everett—and endorsed by him, when very questionable— upon the patience, folly and good nature of a publick, who only want to be run upon for five minutes, to become sensible of their own precarious situation—to check 100 per cent. at least, off hand; and to dishonour, forever, every future draft of the concern. In short—to say all in one word—There were such men as Daniel Webster, Justice Story, Mr. Dana, and Mr. Sparks, among them —and there are now, only the Everett and company, to manage the institution. But there are nevertheless, two or three scientifick works of great merit in our country—at the head of which we may place, Silliman's Journal. More of him anon—and of Cleveland too (an honour to our country) —and of Hayden, a devilish clever fellow in his way. Good by, Stafford—Good by—but, in mercy to our reputation, do not believe that either Mr. Walsh, or Mr. Everett, or their solemn retinue of essay writers, form any part of our natural born Americans. No—they are creatures of another element, unworthy of breathing the same atmosphere. Where is their manhood? They have none. They are always in the rear of publick opinion —always hesitating—always qualifying—so that, happen what may, they are never in a great peril—of being either remarkably right, or remarkably wrong. L But is there nothing—absolutely nothing, to commend, in the North American? Yes—now and then---by some strange accident, they do get a sensible essay into their paper, which smacks of America; and not unfrequently, you find a page or two, that seem to have something to do with the subject. But---farewell---farewell, for the present---hereafter I shall put several of these gentry in training. They deserve it; and, if you please, you may publish what I say---and give my name, on demand, to all who have the heart to ask for it. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. I have just returned from Molton's, and we have agreed upon a time, when he will be as little occupied as possible. He does not suspect my object, I am sure; but I am determined, whatever be the peril, to bring him directly to the point, on the subject of your letter. The interview is to be this evening. He is darker and sterner than ever; and, yesterday, when I called, for the first time, since Juliet and he met in my presence, he refused to be seen. But I saw her—his wife?—yea, his wife. She was wasted away, almost to death; and, when I entered, she started, as if the tread were hostile; nay, during the whole of my visit, for I desired much to see Molton, unsocial as he is--and was not deterred, until she went herself, to get permission, and returned with a promise from him, to see me in the evening—her eyes were glancing, vividly, and continually, toward the door, the court-yard, and the high road, as if something evil were at hand.— She is a majestick creature;—and the tone of her voice, went to my heart. We spoke of foreign parts, and she manifested, at times, a remarkably familiar and apt acquaintance with every thing of interest; at others, it was less so, evidently from her confusion and anxiety. She must be very young, yet—I should think not more than eighteen; and, for an English woman, you know, that is little better than childhood. The servant brought her a folded paper, while I was there;—her hand trembled as she read it; and the colour flew into her face, as she told him, tearing it in pieces, and returning it, to bear it back to the person from whom he brought it, with her compliments. I wish that you could have seen her. She is more sinned against than sinning; yet the fierce spirit of her eyes; the quick movement of her beautiful lip, when agitated; and the white lustre of her hands, when she put aside her redundant black hair, somewhat angrily, while she tore the billet—indicated a disposition compounded of fiery and strange elements; one that I should tremble to encounter, in its wrath. Farewell!—The moment that I have done with Molton, I shall write you the particulars. A singular affair happened night before last at Jane's. Somebody attempted to break into Juliet's room, but was frightened away. A pistol was fired, and it was then discovered to be a woman—some mad creature, we suppose. Juliet was inconceivably alarmed, but it is all over now. JOHN. P. S. I open this to say that yours, from New-Haven, is just received. I have no time to read it now—and have put it aside, to be read and answered, to-night, after my return from Molton's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JOHN. In a letter from Mr. Grenville, whom you may recollect, to my father, that arrived just now, as we sat at the breakfast table, is one for me, from our dear Frank. I have scarcely time to scribble a word; but have determined to keep a sort of journal; and, when the sheet is full, to send it.—The carriage is at the door.—Frank is well —when I have read it, at leisure, I will tell you the particulars. We left New-York about two hours since, rose very early, and are just recovering from the depression and desolateness that followed. The air is yet wintry. Four o'clock.—We shall not reach New-Haven to night, and father begins to wish that we had taken the steam boat, as he recommended at first, and sent the carriage round by land. He is quite distressed about the horses; and I am tempted to laugh, sometimes, at my own insignificance in comparison. We have just dined; and, when we stop to-night, I shall make it a point, to say a word to Juliet.—Heaven bless the dear creature. Nine o'clock.—It has rained all the afternoon; and I am in quite low spirits. My good father, minding his habitual reverence for regularity, rain or shine, gave me a very broad hint, a few moments ago, that I must not think of sitting up any longer than ten, in the parlour; and, after complaining, with much emphasis, of having been jammed up in a close carriage with all sorts of trumpery, “cakery,” band-boxes, and girls, in his good natured way—which you know there is no resisting, he signified that, when travelling, one ought to go to bed at least one hour earlier than usual. I looked at the clock, and smiled, but I was obliged to go. It stood at nine, and was the Q. E. D. to his proposition; a proposition that, more simply conceived, would have stood thus “Come Sarah, pack off! give me a kiss, and pack off.” Nay, at this rate, I shall never begin to make up my despatch for Juliet. So, I will leave off here; write what I can to her, and enclose it, when I can. New Haven.—At last we have arrived. Really, it is a beautiful place, and I have been all over it, I believe. We drove in, over a pleasant road, just as the people began to get abroad, in the morning, and have been constantly occupied since, in racing over the colleges, and examining the fine cabinet of professor Silliman, whose travels in England and Scotland, you have reason to remember, for their beautiful, unpretending simplicity;--and whose travels to Quebec, &amp;c. just issued, I take to be one of the most egregious, and ill-judged pieces of book-making, that was ever perpetrated by so worthy a man.— But the cabinet is truly magnificent. The professor is a man of science; and a work conducted by him here, I am told, is thought very highly of, by our arrogant friends abroad.—The reputation of the college is on the increase; and the library here, is one of the most respectable in America. There are three or four very beautiful churches too, all in a cluster; and, if I may be allowed so to speak, of different orders; one, at any rate, seems really Gothick, and the others, I have not quite pretention enough to give a name to, but they are very pretty. An object of considerable curiosity to strangers, too, is a grave yard. It is full of native marble, of every variety, found, they say, at Middletown, close by—oh, I must not forget a trivial incident, that occurred in our rambling there. It is a traveller's privilege, you know, to be startled, with the commonest thing, when he has nothing else to do.—I was reading an epitaph, when my father touched my arm, and pointed to a figure at a distance, that was leaning against an urn;—it was twilight, and his person could not be distinctly seen, but there was something uncommon, and even striking in his attitude. My father took my arm, and, as we returned, we passed near the place, but the stranger averted his head, folded his arms, and took another path. “Did you not observe him, before,” said my father, carelessly. There was something in his tone, nevertheless, that startled me. I turned and looked in his face, and it instantly flushed across my mind, that there was some suspicion there. I stopped. I laid my hand upon his arm. I remembered how he had resisted, longer and more earnestly than he was wont, my importunity to visit the church yard. “No, sir,” said I, “I never saw the man before, in my life, to my knowledge.” “I am glad of it,” was the reply. But why was he glad of it? Who was the man? Some student, probably, who chose to saunter after us, or rehearse his attitudes, under the affectation of melancholy, (for such was his appearance) and settled despondency, before us, because he saw that we were strangers. “He has followed us a long time,” said my father. “Followed us!—who—that man!”—I exclaimed. It now occurred to me that there was somebody near me, as I came through a long entry, rather dark, from the cabinet of Mineralogy.—Was this the same person? My L 2 blood thrilled at the time, and I turned and caught at my father's arm—I remember, but he took no notice of it, whatever, or whoever it was; for it had passed very quickly. “Yes,” answered my father, “I believe that I have seen him, twice before to-day; both times, he seemed to be observing us; and once, I am sure, he avoided us, as if he were unwilling to be seen. There cousin; if I would stop just there, a very pretty effect might be produced; but unfortunately, the matter has become quite intelligible, since our return. We happened, at tea, to speak of two tremendous rocks, that can be seen from almost any part of the city;---one, in particular, which rears itself up, as from the midst of a plain, blackening, with its shadow, a vast extent of blue water and green turf below. Our landlord heard us, and, as is the fashion here, I find, entered into conversation with us, exactly as if we were in his bar room. My father was mightily pleased with this; and, in his blunt way, kept him in conversation, till the whole mystery came out.--- It seems that there is an asylum for the deaf and dumb here; and the pupils are perpetually playing some mad prank in the neighbourhood;—not long since, they built a great fire upon the top of one of these rocks, at midnight. The effect was terrible—it looked like a furnace in heaven; and the people were all thrown into consternation for awhile. There are several exceedingly interesting creatures, among the helpless association,—gifted beings, whose intellectual faculties seem but the brighter, for the darkness that abides upon their physical organs. How providently are we fitted for such deprivations. If we lose our sight, our feeling becomes all the quicker for it. And so with all our other senses. Have you forgotten our blind friend, Dr. —, the lecturer on opticks, at Edinburgh? Did you ever hear him maintain that it would be better to be born without eyes? He does it, something in this way. I believe. First, he proves that his touch is better than our sight; for he can discover the most delicate scratch, made with an etching tool upon a polished steel plate, with the end of his finger, honed for the purpose, when the naked eye cannot. “The sense of sight,” he goes on to say, “is confined to one organ, so delicate, that the least thing destroys, or impairs it; subject to many peculiar, unknown, and distressing diseases; and always impaired by age and sickness. Once gone, there is no help for you. It is too late then, to cultivate the sense of touch. But if you were born blind, you would get the same exquisite sense that he has. And that cannot be destroyed. Lop off that finger,—it still exists in another. Lop off the hand, the arm, the body; yet while there is one spark of life left, the faculty of the touch remains—it still feels. Therefore, it is better to be born blind!” O—there is one thing, that I had well nigh forgotten. My father, you know, is little curious, or suspicious, about what concerns me. Therefore it is, that, feeling proud of his confidence, I cannot conceal anything from him. Be careful then, hereafter, of what you say; for, if he should desire to see your letters, I shall certainly show them to him. I mention this because, lately when I received an anonymous note (relating to Molton,) his pleasant eyes grew serious, and he remarked, with some little petulance, that I seemed to be rather too full of negotiation. So—be wise in season, and, whatever you write of your own, take care not to put that which concerns another, in the power of accident. Farewell, SARAH. P. S. O, there is no doubt that the stranger is one of the poor deaf and dumb creatures of the asylum.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. Juliet, my sweet Juliet!—would that I were near thee!—I might then prove to thee, how deeply I have been affected by thy counsel. I wanted but that, it would seem, to know thee, perfectly, as thou art—the most patient of human beings, the most benignant, the most forgiving. If my heart were not the better for thy chiding, I know not what could make it better. Am I humbler, in reality? I do believe that I am, dear; but I cannot declare it yet, until I have had my humility more fully tried. They tell me that there is—some prospect of thy—restoration, I was about to say;—but no, it would be cruel—I ought not to say it. Do not believe me;— disregard it—I pray thee: continue as prepared as thou hast been; as resigned, as lowly, and if aught can help thee, that tranquillity and submissiveness will. I meant to have written a long letter, but I cannot. My spirits are heavy; and there is a strange perturbation at my heart, that I cannot attribute to aught but my distress for thee, dear, patient, Juliet—heaven be with thee!—forever and ever; and, if we must part, all my prayer is, that thou mayest pass away, as thou hast lived, in purity and quiet; and, that I may follow thee, as purely, and as quietly.—Farewell!—but with all my effort, all my apprehension, I cannot bring myself to realize thy danger.—What!—but yesterday, my companion at the school, so beautiful, so full of health, and to day— O, no, it cannot be.—Thou art not so very frail.—Ah— what have I done!—Juliet, dear Juliet, do not regard me! Do not let me delude thee. Expect death—expect nothing else—farewell—. My father has just sent up to inform me, that the gentleman and family, whom he was expecting to meet at Boston, have actually arrived within a few miles of this city; and that, instead of going to Boston, now, they will join their forces, and proceed, directly, to Lake George, or to Niagara, while the water is at the fullest, with the melting snow, and spring rains. I shall continue to write thee, at every stage, and send, as I can. In the mean time, my friend, my sister, my beloved Juliet, let nothing disturb thee;—think not of the past—and O, think not of—nay, I must not name him—and write me as thou canst. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO JAMES HARROW. I pray you, my dear Harrow, do not address me again, with the title of Esquire. I do not like it, and am not authorized to assume it. Nay, to speak seriously, it offends me, when a man of sense, knowing me to be an American, calls me Esquire. Your affectionate letter came to me in a good time. Some circumstances, of a nature too serious to explain, have kept me, for a long time, nay, ever since we parted, in a state of continual agitation. The natural result of which, is, exactly what you predicted. I am not long for this world. My body is worn out. It may be, that my mind hath shattered it. But, be it what it may, the fulfilment of my destiny is rapidly accomplishing. Yet, nobody knows it. I would go quietly, if I can. Can you believe that I have forgotten you? no—you knew well, at the moment when your pen traced the words; or you would have known it, had you stopped your hand, and asked yourself the question, that it was false. It was one of your habitual phrases, Harrow, and said without any meaning at all. Were it not so, I should have been mortified and alarmed. You know that I do not easily form an attachment; that my heart is barren of late, of fruit and blossom—iron—that its germinating principle is extinguished; that it never will be in flower again— Can you believe then, that it has forgotten the time, the spring time of its power, when it loved and was beloved; when it chose you for its friend, and—no—no—no— Harrow, you knew that I had not “forgotten you.” It was unworthy of you, and of me, therefore, to say so, even in pleasantry. It was worse—it was childish—the coquetry of a man. You tell me that Clinton Howard is dead. I am glad of it. My blood leaped in my veins, when I saw the name. Being dead—I forgive him. It might have been otherwise, had we met. In sickness and death, we are forgiving—but the current of hostility flows in, with the flow of the blood, again. I am not used, you know, to carrying my sword away, without a “heart stain upon it,” where I am so wronged, accursed, so irretrievably accursed, as I have been, by the machinations of that man. Tell him that I forgive him—tell him—. But I forget.—Ah, Harrow—I shall meet him, before you do; and I will tell him so, with my own lips—yes—tear open my bosom before him, shew him a heart, a noble heart---reduced to blackness and death, by his infernal sorceries; uncover my side-- shew him the serpent that is feeding there; and then, while the hand of the Judge is upon us both,—I'll—no matter—no matter—. Time enough, when we meet. The husband---Harrow, is it true? Beware how you trifle with me. I am in no humour for such things. I have just come to that passage again. Can it be that he survived? Do you really believe it?—“the tomb empty;” perhaps it was done by the surgeons, Harrow. Such things have happened. At any rate, hear me, hear me, as thou lovest me, and O, if there be one pulse of that gallant nature that thou hadst, when we parted, go to the bottom of this story. See if he be really and truly, a living man. Then see where he is—where is her brother? Spare no expense—none;—go to the bottom of the ocean---the ends of the earth---but let me hear the result by the first vessel. Nay, send a duplicate by every vessel that comes to America. Do this, and I will bless thee, Harrow, bless thee, with my latest breath. O, if it be true, indeed, what a load will be taken off my heart. Then, I shall be happy---then, Harrow, I shall care not how soon he may strike his dagger into my side. I shall die contented. Would you believe it? The people here, do not even know that I was ever in your country. One or two have said it, but they have always said it, doubtfully. And my own mother, even she does not know that I am other than what I seem to the whole world; stern and solitary. No! she does not suspect that there is blood, blood, Harrow, upon these hands. They call me a Scot, too!—excellent! I was interrupted. Harrow, nobody knows me here. I sit alone. I walk alone. I hold no communion with aught that hath life in it—except —. Have I said enough? What has she not endured for me?—and can I leave her? No, no!—though the heavens were to pass away, this night—this very night, in thunder and smoke, I should not be alone---I should not know it---if Helen were near me. Harrow, my hand shakes so, that I can scarcely see the paper. The whole atmosphere is reddish, and full of bright characters. Do you believe in ghosts? I am serious, Harrow. Do you believe it possible that a dead man may return? If such a thing be possible, then have I seen a man that I once slew. He was at my elbow this moment. Can you read what I write? I cannot. But still I go on—on—on—seeing nought, hearing nought, determined to bear up to the last—a— I have been sick, Harrow. Something has happened to me. I know not what;—but when I come to myself, just now, it was totally dark about me, and I knew not where I was. At first, I had some confused notion that the day of judgment had come;—and then, that I was at sea, and had been thrown out of my birth, as I once was, when the ship was struck by a squall, and rolled over.— At last, however, I recollected myself perfectly. I arose —rang the bell—waited for lights to come—and have set down again. Am I afraid? Yes, mortally afraid; but I dare not acknowledge it. One person might be deceived, Harrow—the guilty one;—I can conceive of that. But, how happens it, that this supernatural shivering—this horrour and chilliness—at a certain hour, is common to all that inhabit this apartment, or the next? How is it that strangers are unable to sleep here? No! I dare not confess that I am afraid. Poor Helen!—it is only last night that I was awakened out of a sweet, O! a most sweet and refreshing slumber, almost the first that I have had, since we entered this accursed mansion, by a quick cry, and a dead weight falling upon my naked breast.— I awoke. Poor Helen was lifeless. Her cold hand embraced mine like that of a drowning creature. The moon shone through the red curtains with a sickly strange lustre, and the whole room was bright, in all but one spot. That was dark,—but even that soon became bright; and then, I awoke my sweet Helen. God of heaven!— how cold she was. I shuddered as if I held a corpse— another corpse, Harrow, to my heart, and was carrying it, in the starlight, to burial. But why do I tell thee of that? Thou knowest nothing of it—thou—oh, thou art as unsuspecting, as they that are about me. They see me, know me, talk to me;—but little do they dream of what I am capable, or of what I have done. We lay and conversed, nearly all the night; and I was chilled by the contact. Her arms enfolded me, like frozen serpents. The affinity between us seemed suspended for awhile.— O, Harrow, how bitterly have we suffered!—how cruelly, how inconceivably, have we been slandered! By heaven, there never was a righteous movement of the hand or heart of man, which might not be represented to his destruction. Well, we lay and talked of the apparition. I ridiculed her fears;---but her cold cheek was close to my heart; and, I am sure, that its palpitation was a distressing subject of doubt, to her. She wept---and I embraced her, chilly and damp as she felt;---while her redundant hair swept over my arms, as if the spectre were there. Yea, I embraced her in his very presence! I know that he was standing over us. I felt it. It was in defiance. Were it aught that would have appeared, at my bidding, Harrow, naked as I was, weak as I was, I would have summoned it again, and put my questioning home to it!---I would! by my everlasting soul! What! have I lived to this age, to be the sport of malicious shadows. What business has it here? If here—why does it trouble Helen?—why, my friends? Have I not seen a shadow, blacker than all the surrounding darkness, again and again, at my bedside? Why was it there? O, Harrow, pity me. There is some terrible delusion in this. I know it. I am sure of it. Yet, I would give my right arm to understand it. The cause is a natural one. I do not doubt that; but my flesh creeps—yes, even now, it creeps—at the creaking, perhaps, of the door— Harrow, my friend, give me thy hand! It dare not face me! It dare not take a shape to itself, and appear before me! No!—it is the shadow of a dastard! I have called to it!---dared it!---cursed it, on my knees, in prayer and blasphemy, but it would not appear. It dared not! Perhaps I have been mistaken. It was only for a moment, that I ever saw anything; and that was in the great mirror, before which I am writing; and sometimes, God forgive me for my pusillanimity, I get so appalled and crushed by the weight of terrour and desolation, that was upon me, that I dare not lift up my eyes to it! No, Harrow, it dare not face me! But it went by me, in the wind. It was his whisper, too. I could swear to it. I felt it. It was evil. It was no friendly visiting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Evening.— Two days have passed. I am still very weak, and subject to such frequent fits of derangement, that I dared not take out the sheet on which I have been writing, lest I should be too suddenly seized, and it might fall into the hands of Helen, or of some one that I would not like to know me. But I am more cheerful, now. She is sitting opposite to me;—her beautiful eyes lowering upon me, continually, in all their ravishing brightness. I am every hour expecting a young man, of whom I have a high opinion. He is romantick in his temper; and the dark grandeur of my habitation, and, perhaps, the mystery about its master, have captivated him. Till he comes, I must do the best that I can, to finish this long letter; but you deserve a long one, my friend;—and I shall try to give you, page for page. My nerves are exceedingly shattered, and I have no confidant but you—judge of my situation. Apropos, of Baltimore. I do not wonder at your prejudice; but the worst story that you have heard is mightily exaggerated. That murder happens now and then, is true;—that boys have gone upon the highway,—and deliberately thrust a knife into a poor fellow's heart, when he was bound hand and foot, is true; that many a privateer, during the late war, has become a pirate, or slave trader since; and, probably, under the countenance of some of our great men, is extremely probable, to say the least of it;—that there was a mob here not long since, in which a dozen respectable citizens where nearly murdered and hung—and one old man, an officer of the revo M lution was murdered outright, by a rabble, whom a single company of horse would have dispersed; and that the murderers escaped on trial, is also true:—but, after all, there are as fine and free spirited a set of fellows, in Baltimore, as any where else on this earth. They are frank, and hospitable,—and honest, I have no doubt, in the main, notwithstanding the bank-robberies of some respectable scoundrels,—and the unparalleled commercial gambling; and consequent failure of another part of the community, as any body of people to be found—out of Edinburg or Botany Bay.[3] [3] The yellow fever, and all such matters, are attributed to the establishment of a church in Baltimore, where they worship but one God. These last words are by Helen—seeing me stop, for a phrase, and knowing that I was writing to you—she made me read what I had written, and then added that. Hereafter, I shall make it a point to set you right in several matters relating to this country, and the state of literature and the fine arts, here; at present, I must content myself with replying to your story of the pirates. I shall tell it, as it was, without favour or partiality. As it is told abroad, I admit, that it looks serious. There is little difference, to be sure, in the facts, but the colouring is, in general, too like substance. The story, if I understand it, with you, is, that we are a nest of pirates,—scarcely better, in Baltimore, than the Barbary powers:—that, it is almost impossible to bring a pirate to justice here; and that, when you have overcome all the tricks of law, the partiality of the judges, the ability and eloquence of counsel, the reluctance of the jury,—and obtained a verdict, and a condemnation:—that, after all this, the chief magistrate is sure to be beset for a pardon, or commutation of the punishment;—that he almost always, in his covetousness of popularity, fearfulness of offending —, and from a few other equally worthy and dignified considerations, does pardon them. But that, when he refuses—and these pirates are actually hung, the citizens cut them down in form; go, in procession to the burial, just as they did to that of Washington and Lawrence (a naval captain here—commander of the Chesapeake)—and deposit their bodies in consecrated ground. All this is too true. The case did occur once. Two men were, formally, deliberately, and reluctantly condemned as pirates;—suffered as pirates; and should have been buried as pirates. But no, some well meaning citizens petitioned the president—who, merciful and weak as he is, would not pardon them, nor commute the penalty; and therefore, to show their respect to him and the law, they went in procession to their graves; honoured them as martyrs—as the victims of the law—not as pirates;—not, as they really were, of that remorseless band, who traverse the ocean, and make war upon the poor mariner,—the most defenceless of God's creatures. But it is said that they were innocent. Innocent! How is that known? How dare you presume such a thing in the face of their condemnation, under the deliberate wisdom of your laws? Do you believe it? On what proof? Is there any? No—No. You have listened to their own story, and who cannot tell as plausible a one? Who, if his own story be believed, will ever be found guilty of any crime? No, Harrow, it was a mistaken thing,—rash and unthinking, got up in resentment to the President of the United States, because he refused, wisely refused their pardon. Suppose that they were innocent of bloodshed. There was still enough left to make them guilty of piracy. And piracy is not to be forgiven, by a commercial people. No—if there be aught to complain of, it is the clemency of our chief magistrate. He should be inflexible. I would divest him of the power of pardoning. What then? The jury would be less likely to condemn. No more criminals would suffer, and the majesty of the law would be vindicated. Were they innocent? So much the better for themselves. The drunken man, who commits murder, may not have intended to kill;—the man, found in possession of stolen goods, may have found them, as he declares, when he was alone;—but there is no help for him—there should be none, except in his general character. Both may be innocent; but if you pardon the former, you invite men to the commission of murder, under pretence of inebriety; and could never punish one, merely from finding stolen goods in his possession. Nay, the law ought to examine rigorously the plea of insanity, itself. It is easily counterfeited;—it were very easy, for one who meditated some tremendous revenge—I know it, Harrow—to betray, for months before, by his extravagance, enough to startle the jury, when on trial. But let him perish. If there be the slightest doubt that he was truly mad—let him perish! God will do him justice. We cannot:---and the policy of society commands us to judge of men, by appearances; and of actions, by their consequences. I stopped, on looking at my watch, for the time is close at hand; and I feel a growing inquietude to know why I am so seriously interrogated. The unclouded moon shines beautifully in upon us, now. How mildly, strangely expressive, is her face. I see shadows passing over it, as she goes onward, onward, forever onward, on her sweet, quiet pilgrimage;---the light itself grows dim; and the loveliness of Helen is truly spiritual at this moment. She remembers you;---weeps, now and then, in thinking of old times;---and—but farewell. It is time to part, indeed. Farewell! Don't forget that the Baltimoreans are a generous, warm-hearted, noble people, and cruelly slandered, not only by you, but by their countrymen. Yours, truly and heartily, ED. MOLTON. James Harrow, London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. Sarah— Fall down upon thy knees, to our blessed Father in heaven! He hath had compassion upon me; my complaint is not that of death. The crisis hath passed; several consultations have been held—an operation performed, and I have come out, again, from the chamber of darkness; from the very tomb, I might say, like one rejoicing from the sepulchre---among the flowers, and wind, and sunshine of another world. O, Sarah, in this calm evening, with the dear blue sky, floating dimly up there, where I might have been at this monent, in His mercy, had he not forborne a little while; and the cold air just stirring the myrtle leaves, there at the window—O, what a horrible sense I have of the past---the loneliness and desolation that I was hastening to.---Stay---one word more.—I am forbidden to write, even to thee; and they are shutting the windows, at this moment, as if the breath of God, were not the breath of life to me. Where is our friend John? I have not seen him for two weeks. Nobody knows where he is. And I would have told you, Sarah, with my own hand, earlier than this, what the prospect was, of my recovery, but I waited to have the hope confirmed. I was willing to die.—Was I?—O, I know not. I could not die now. How strange it is. I look back at that willingness, with wonder and amazement. I ask myself, if it be possible that I—I, a poor, weak, trembling creature, was so well prepared, as it seemed, to go before the judgment-seat. Sarah, I can scarcely breathe, when I think of what I have escaped. Was I nerved by desperation? Criminals, they say, are so, sometimes; and stand firm to the last; when, at the slightest whisper, or murmur of compassion, or hope, they are agitated to convulsion. Nay, have I not heard my father say, that, in the battles of the Revolution, he did his duty, like a man—(no, like a brute;—) without one thought of fear---one prayer to his Maker, when the balls poured in upon them, like a storm of hail from the sky; and afterward, when alone in the dim wood, journeying with no other companion, than Him, whom he had forgotten in his greatest need, that he has fallen flat upon his face, at the recollection of his tremendous insensibility? I would not add another word, for it is unaccouutable to me, how I have had the strength, to write so much, in the flutter of my heart, at breathing the fresh air, once more, with none of that warm, sickening earthiness, that fills the death chamber and which, in my old horrour of being buried alive, has made me fancy, more than once, M 2 that I was buried, and breathing in a charnel house. But I must desire that you never mention a certain name to me, again; nor remind me, henceforth, in any way, of it, or of him, or of aught that hath ever passed. His time has gone by. He is lost. Your opinion of him, is nearer the truth than mine was. And above all, never disquiet yourself more, about him and me. Farewell— J. R. G.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JOHN. Near the Falls of Niagara.— We are now within two miles and a half of the cataract. I can hear it roar, distinctly; and the earth appears to tremble under my feet. I do not say that it does actually, tremble, but only, that it appears to. Perhaps it may be the agitation of the air; or, it may be that there is that sympathy between these elements, which makes one correspond to the movement of the other, as the most inert things will, to the sound of musick. You can hear this, you know, in a room where it is all silent, and two instruments are in perfect unison. If you touch one, the other will answer; nay, have you never heard of a gentleman in Philadelphia, whose voice is so powerful and clear, that the glasses on the table will ring, if they be put together, half a dozen, or so, when he is singing? I can answer for its truth, for my father knows him, and has heard the mysterious reply; or, (one more illustration and I have done;) have you never felt the wood tremble, when you have been at church, and your hand rested on the pew, while the organ was playing? Perhaps the earth answers here, to this organ of the waters. What a conceit!—but is it worse than that of the poet, over whose pages we have so often laughed, and scolded, and held our breath, by turns, while he described —no, he did not describe it, the “tempest hymning” of these falls? And this reminds me of a question that I dare say has occurred to you and others, time and again. Why was it called the “Battle of Niagara? What has Niagara to do with it? or the falls? or the battle? Nothing—absolutely nothing. Yet, having chosen the name, he probably thought it rather too barefaced, not to mention either of them, in the poem. But how does he mention them?—precisely as a man would, who had never seen, or cared for either.—Good bye—they are all ready. The sun is shining out, and we are sure of having a delightful time. Well!—we have returned. We have seen the wonder, and I am entirely out of breath. Shall I tell the truth? I am giddy and blind, but very much disappointed. What exaggerated pictures the imagination will form of such matters. The poet was right;—he has never been there, they say;—and it is well that he has not. Had he been there, and studied the whole in detail, there would then have been none of that indistinctness, shadow, and darkness, in his picture, which provoked all my powers of thought to contention. Yes, I am disappointed;—and this, notwithstanding my caution. It reminds me of Harper's Ferry. Mr. Jefferson says, it is worth crossing the Atlantick to see. Fudge! I went there, and, at the hazard of my neck, clambered up Mr. Jefferson's rock, where, it is said, that he sat, manufacturing his notes; looked about me for the “war of the rivers and mountains,” about which he made such a fuss in his book, and came away, mortified to the soul, that so great a man, should have been so intemperate. But he, himself, is ashamed of it now, I believe; and speaks of his past enthusiasm, as rather that of the blood than the brain. So, too, my father once went somewhere up the Kennebeck river, in the District of Maine. It was said, in Morse's Geography, (and Dr. Morse is the man, you recollect, that speaks of “brass mines,”) to be the greatest fall, in height, not in quantity, to be found in the United States, not excepting Niagara, itself. My father took a guide, wallowed some miles, up to his middle, in snow, (no very light matter, he used to say, for one of his habit and temper,) and knew not that he was near the awful place, till his guide called to him, to stop! or he was lost! My father was near a tree; and, in his horrour, caught at a projecting limb. The snow, upon which he had stood, caved in, at the same moment, and my poor father owed his preservation to the tree alone. Being extricated from this, his guide called his attention to the falls. They were said to be about two hundred feet; but some idea may be formed of their descent, from the fact, that a horse went down them once, and came out alive below. My father looked about him, for the signs of the water, but none appeared. There were a few holes, here and there, in the snow---and the broken crust was whiter in the middle, and heaped up, in a narrow and glittering ridge, as if water ran aslant under it. But these were the falls—these!—And it was very probable that their descent was about as great as Dr. Morse had been told; but, unluckily, he had forgotten to mention the distance included in that descent. It might have been from the source, to tide water; or, to the ocean itself, for aught that we know. But my disappointment, here, was not so great. I was stunned and awed for a time;—and I grew frightfully dizzy in looking at the frail contrivance, by which so many precious creatures were accustomed to descend, into the very whirl of the waters. Nay, were I not afraid of being laughed at, I should say that one person, whom I saw there, under the very arch of the cataract, was the deaf and dumb man that we met in the grave-yard! His dress was different; but his manner, an indescribable something, that was about him, makes me believe it, yet, in spite of probability. Is it the love of the marvellous? or the romantick? or, am I possessed? What should he do here, poor wretch?—I ask myself again, and again; and then, I feel a sensation, nearly allied to terrour, when I think of his danger. Can it be that he has followed us? If so, let us be gone. I cannot endure the thought; yet it constantly obtrudes itself. I have taken no notice of it, here; and my father, I am sure, has not seen him, or does not perceive the resemblance. Indeed, when I began this, I did not mean to mention him; for I was rather angry at something that had occurred. At first, I felt compassion for him; but his pertinacity has provoked a—Bless me, cousin, I am speaking exactly as if it were he, the deaf and dumb man, beyond a doubt. O, this reminds me of some of your nonsense, John. What meant you, some time ago, in one of your long letters, where you reasoned, for a moment, quite seriously, about the existence of spirits? Were you in good earnest? If you were, my resentment, which kept me from replying, was just. Were you not in earnest? Then were you most unhappy in your pleasantry;—for it has given my father an authority, that I am sorry for, for believing what, I am sure, was a deception of the senses, the very night before my blessed mother's death. What shall I say to you? Should I be indignant? No!—and my advice is, neither to believe, nor disbelieve, in such things on speculation. There may be wisdom in what is unintelligible to us;—but I cannot believe that the vilest creatures of the earth, all that are about us, are made eloquent with prophecy, which is utterly unintelligible. Is not their superstition excessive, always, in proportion to the rudeness of a people? Does it not, always, keep pace with ignorance? Assuredly, it does. So, let us say no more about it. But, if you should see fit to renew the subject, at some future day, do not let my excellent father get to the knowledge of it. It troubles him, I can perceive, more than he is willing to confess. And now, let me return to the falls;—but no, I cannot speak of them. I hate putting ones self out in description. People enough have described them, and all have failed; they, probably, the most, who have most studied to be fine. Some paintings, and one, in particular, by a lady of Boston, in oil, gave me some notion of the smoke and thunder that I was to encounter. The sky and the water were all in agitation, as with a great battle. But all descriptions are mockery. They either want indistinctness; are so minute in describing the parts, as to prevent your obtaining any notion of the whole, like Belzoni's account of the scratching and chiseling in the pyramids;—or they are inflated and ridiculous, to an insupportable degree. There is a person, one who was never there, too, but who has been supposed to have been there, by another, who sat with his testimony in his hand, and compared the poetical description with the reality; and then, came away, wondering at the faculty of observation in poets; and their power of seeing and touching out, what is passed over with indifference, or utterly unseen, by others!—and—(but I cannot finish the sentence)—I—. O—I have just caught a glimpse of the stranger's face —it is noble; not in feature, but in expression. I shall never forget it;—he has just past my window, (on the most beautiful horse, that I ever saw—all in a foam.) To return.—I do not know why it is; but, from these lines, particularly the four last, my imagination had taken a more faithful picture of the cataract, than from all else that I have seen; and yet, they contain no picture, not even an outline. All is general, dim, and tumultuous. Were the poet a painter, I suppose that he would give us Niagara somewhat after this fashion. A glimpse only, of the sky; no landscape,—no, he would scorn to copy a single line as it is; but the whole atmosphere would appear in commotion; and about the rocks, there would be a vivid, quick, tremulous outline, as if they quaked and shivered, incessantly, in the uproar; the spray would be insupportably bright; great birds, dashing hither and thither through it; and the water would go up, like breakers, to the very top of the picture. “Home of the waters!—where their strength “Rolls in immeasurable length; “Or, tumbling from their cloudy thrones, “As thundering from a battlement, “With marshal hymning, like the tones, “Of battle-shout by warriours' sent, “Go, rioting in foam and spray, “With rainbow-streamers o'er their way, “Beneath the precipice they've rent; “Exulting, as they burst their cloud, “As high, as dazzling, and as loud, “As sheets of light, in their descent “Through midnight's parting firmament.” I believe, cousin, if you had stood where I did, and seen the thick cloud above—the blazing brightness of the water, shooting, all at once, out of it, into the sunshine, with the tremendous musick of its roaring—that you would have clasped your hands, as I did, and acknowledged, that the madman, (for, I am told, that the poor fellow, who wrote that, is mad,) was singularly happy in the four last lines. The first part would have been better relished by me, if there had been a rainbow, when I was there;—for, I declare to you, the noise of the thunder was martial, like the ringing of ten thousand trumpets—the rolling of ten thousand drums—and artillery in proportion! Really! What do you think of that?— Should'nt I make a pretty poet, with a little encouragement? One moment more, and then, good bye, to the poet and the poem— the waters and the thunder—reminding you that it was impossible to visit Niagara, without recalling somewhat of a work, put forth with such a pretending title—Do you remember this? It struck me very forcibly.— “Above, where the torrent is forth, in its might, “Like an imprisoned blaze, that is bursting from night! “Or a lion, that springs—with a roar—from his lair!— “Bounding off, all in foam—from the echoing height, “Like a rank of young war-horses, terribly bright— “Their manes all erect, and their hoofs in the air! “The earth shaking under them—trumpets on high— “And banners unfurling away in the sky— “With the neighing of steeds, and the streaming of hair! No wonder that the man is mad, cousin, is it? I have followed his own punctuation—his own—indeed;— for there is nothing more peculiarly his, than his dashing. But, let me be done. That poor deaf and dumb man— cousin, I can't get him out of my head. He haunts me like a spectre. Turn which way I will, the first object that I catch, is a shadow like his, that, as it cannot be where I see it---must be in my own brain! Well. well. He'll have to walk fast, if he keep up with us, after tomorrow. We shall go the battle-ground next. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. The curiosity that you express, my dear fellow, is altogether natural. You feel, toward our American writers, just as I do about your English ones. In return, therefore, for your sketching of Byron, Campbell, and your study of Wordsworth (whom I can see, with his smooth hair, at this moment,) Hunt, Coleridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. with glimpses, of their conversation and hand writing, I shall give you something of the same kind, and as much after the same plan, as I am able. I will begin with them as they come to me. Paul Allen, of Baltimore.—He is rather below the middle size—say, about five feet six—dark eyes—dark hair—face, deeply marked—a plain looking, nay, an ordinary looking man; about forty or forty two, I should think, with a character of sluggishness, slovenly inaptitude and moroseness, all about him. Yet, there is not a better natured fellow on the earth—bating a momentary petulence, here and there, with a far-off politician, in the way of trade; or a little fermentation at home, when he has been pestered by poppinjays, a little too long; nor a man that will write more, with less substantial information, on any subject, in the same time. He is near-sighted; reads with his nose on the paper—and such reading! Lord!—I can imagine nothing more dismal, than the reading of his own poetry, by Paul Allen. It is a continual whine—nasal—and barbarous, beyond all conception. No man would take him for any thing above a hard-working tradesman, should he meet him, away from his daily occupation; he is full of simplicity, credulous too, as a child, and very irresolute; and yet, how he writes! He has a strange face, strongly moulded, unlike any that I have ever seen, in your country; but very like that of Mr. Jarvis, the painter, in ours. He has a fine dazzling talent; a penetrating fidgetty eloquence; and great pungency, all which are continually to be seen in his prose. But he has a bad notion of poetry; he is too easily satisfied with bad rhyming, inadequate expression, and ordinary, simple thought, which he endeavours to touch your heart with, after the manner of Wordsworth, of whom he is a devout admirer; but their simplicity is totally unlike. That of Allen is never so simple, so affecting, or so awful, as that of Wordsworth; nor is it ever so feeble and childish. Paul Allen is no imitator; or, rather, no imitator of any one man; but he is of many:—and there is nothing beautiful, sarcastick, eloquent, strange, touching, or sublime, in another, which, when he encounters it, will not instantly beget a correspondent expression in him. I can always tell what he has been reading, when he comes out, on any uncommon occasion. He is very like Burke, at times; and throws away more genuine poetry, without knowing it, upon the daily transactions of commercial and political gossipping, than any living writer; and this, too, while that which he husbands and hoards for poetry, is often the very refuse of an exhausted mind; the dregs and dross of a crucible, where the gold and fire, of earth and sky, have been undergoing the most beautiful transmutation, for the entertainment of children. He is a man that would throw pearls and diamonds into the furnace, to see what colour their smoke would be; and then gather up the ashes and cinders; put them carefully by, in a golden urn, write thereon; with all his might, a deep and sad inscription to the emptiness and mutability of all earthly enjoyment—and fall asleep with it in his arms. He has no colloquial power—yet the company of few people is more pleasant, to them that know him intimately. He has written, successively, for the United States' Gazette;—the Port Folio, before it was dead and damned; —the Baltimore Telegraph, of which he was the Editor for many years, when it was in the zenith;—the Portico; ---a poem, called Noah;—and volume after volume, of editorial matter, for the Journal of the Times, and the Morning Chronicle. N He was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and educated for the bar:—writes a sort of jumping, up and down hand—which nobody but himself, and his compositors, can read. Washington Irving.—He is about thirty-nine, now —about five feet, six or seven inches in height—a little clumsy—very pale—fine blue eyes, continually shifting through shadow and light—very white teeth—and a charming smile—very black hair, and heavy black eyebrows; with all the air of your old fashioned, high bred gentleman;—by that, I mean not, that he is old fashioned, in the common meaning of the phrase; but, that he is a gentleman, without being a puppy. He is neither a macaroni—dandy—exquisite—nor corinthian, names which mean the same thing, through all the successive changes of folly, from the time of Queen Anne, to the present. His manner is full of composure and gentleness. He was educated for the bar;—was born in New-York—a few miles from the city, I believe,—made two or three attempts at the bar—and abandoned the profession, in despair, from a total inability to undergo the coarse, and continual exasperation of conflict and rivalry. His friends have thought his modesty and timidity a disqualification—stuff! The profession of the law is the best market in the world for both; and, to my notion, it argues no great degree of modesty—whatever people may say of Cowper—Curran—Garrick, before the court as a witness—Mr. Bayard of Delaware—or Mr. Irving of New-York—that each and all of them, were overwhelmed with confusion in their first attempt at speaking, in a new situation. To my thought, it looks much more like the natural effect, of entertaining too high an opinion of one's self. He, who believes that all eyes are upon him —that every thing is expected from him—that no allowances will be made for inexperience, embarrassment and alarm—must fail.—But he, who is modest enough, not to attempt a miracle—nor to expect that others are looking for one, will be likely to succeed. Washington Irving is, emphatically, an amiable man, without being a weak one. He takes every thing—short of what would darken the heart of any human creature, disappointment in love, or fame, or ambition—all in good part; and even the rest, he takes like one, that is too good —not too proud, to repine. In early life, I have heard it said, that he lost the woman of his heart, by death. That were enough to account for the beautiful shadow that abides, forever and ever, upon the landscape of his affection. His manner and style are his own. He is precisely among authors, what your Westall is among painters. I cannot imagine, and do not know a truer parallel. He has written part of Salmagundi—Knickerbocker's New-York—Biographical Sketches of the American Naval Commanders, during the last war—the Sketch-Book, and Bracebridge Hall—with sundry little things, “Recollections of a Student” in the New Monthly—and some criticism on Campbell, in a very sensible way. Paulding.—A little, slender, sharp, dark-looking man, with an expression of habitual discontent in his eyes —strong natural talent—and a happy, though not a fine turn, for sober irony and sarcasm. You would swear that he was forever fretting, and quarrelling at the heart, with all the world—from the very countenance of the man—and that it never could be otherwise. He is the very opposite of Irving, with whom he was associated in making up Salmagundi; and not at all companionable, or social. There is an air of constitutional disdain of the world—with a great deal of artificial disdain, for that very world, which he is continually courting, indirectly,—in all that he does and says. Yet I would trust to his heart, I think, rather than to Irving's, if I wanted a friend that would go to the devil for me. He is a fellow of strong mind—without brilliancy—and a little— a very little playfulness: but a homebred talent—vigorous—pure and lasting. He has written a good deal— only a part of which, I can now call to mind—the Backwoodsman (a poem) a satirical novel, telling the story of our revolution—part of Salmagundi—and “Letters from the South.” He was born in Connecticut, New-England. Neale.—It is impossible to know this man well. I have taken a good deal of pains to understand his character, from those who have seen him, every day, for many years; but no two of them seem to have the same opinion of him. By some he is thought to be all that is bad— short of being an outlaw; by others, all that is noble and high of heart. The majority, by a thousand to one, are of the former opinion. I confess, that he is continually baffling me, in my estimate, not only of him, but of his talents, they are so various, contradictory, and capricious. Yet, I do believe that he has great power, and a good heart, which, if it be not dampened by continual disappointment; and kept down by a mighty pressure, at the hazard of crushing all its principles of vitality, will either purify itself, at last, in its own fires, or be consumed to ashes. Nay—there are those who expect to see it fall in, every hour, alleging that it has been for many years, inwardly consuming. He is a yankee too—a self educated man— born in Massachusetts or Maine—whose whole life has been a tissue of wild and beautiful adventure. He was born of poor parents; put apprentice to a shopkeeper, without education—ran the gauntlet, it is said, through half a dozen professions; and, finally, at the age of twenty three or four, sat himself down to study the law, without, at that time, understanding the rudiments of English grammar. He is about five feet, eight or nine—well made—light brown hair, light complexion; small, clear, serene, blue eyes—large mouth—very high forehead—stooping in his gait;—about thirty now, with a settled expression of haughtiness, and proud discontent—in his very tread-look, and tone. His eyes are full of it—his forehead is full of it—his voice—nay, every thing about him, gives note of an unquiet spirit, continually at her incantations. Rouse him, and you hear his voice, like an alarum in your blood. He is certainly unamiable—and, in the opinion of women, very ungenteel;—exceedingly positive, loud, abrupt, and imperious; and yet, I am told that no human creature is gentler—or fuller of frolick—or more of a boy, than he, when he is at home with them that have long known him. His contempt for the world is more natural than that of any other man, whom I ever knew; yet even his, I am sure, is partly affected. Else why that continual effort for the notice of the world? Why so ambitious?—studious?—headlong? Men may say what they will about being above the opinion of the world. They cannot be so. Such men would instantly die.— They could not live for a moment in a world, about whose opinion they cared nothing; they would be like some animal in an exhausted receiver. They would ascend to the skies by their own levity—their own impalpability. The law of attraction could not operate upon such spiritualities. No—no—the flame of ambition cannot burn for a moment, where the breath of the world cannot reach it; and, wherever you see an ambitious man, you may be sure, that you have misunderstood him, or that he lied, when he talked about a carelessness of the world's opinion. They say that he is overbearing and quarrelsome; and, if so, of course, he is cowardly. The public opinion is very much against him—so far, I mean, as mere popularity will go;—but, the most that I can learn of evil in his character, except what is to be inferred from general prejudice, I should be inclined to think had grown out of his haughty temper; his vanity; his unwillingness to soothe and conciliate, what he calls the rabble; and a wounded and impatient spirit, sore with continual buffeting—gored into warfare—and determined never to yield. I ask them if he is melancholy—low spirited—or troubled with ill-health, like other men of a literary or poetical habit. But I am told that he is never melancholy; never low-spirited—that he is never more than serious, angry, or stern;—sustained by unexhaustible animal spirits---and never sick.—If such be the case, he may do something to redeem himself, after all. Let him learn a little discretion---subdue his hot temper---hurry less, in his manifestation of feeling, and---who knows if he may not die a very decent sort of a man. He has written more books, I believe, than are either known or read. He can write a variety of hands--- and, in a variety of styles---but does, generally, write in a fluent, illegible, positive, perpendicular scrawl;--and in a style overflowing with start and turbulence. I have N 2 seen a few pages, I confess, of his, that were full of a deep, quiet beauty; but, in general, I would as soon think of amusing myself, with a regiment of your horse guards, each blowing his own trumpet with both hands, and galloping about me, continually over a cast-iron pavement, as with one of his furious set-to's, in what I dare say, he thinks fine writing. He wrote Keep Cool; Niagara; Goldau; Otho; and was editor of the Telegraph, and one of the editors of the Portico, I have heard, for a long time. Some other works are attributed to him. Everett.—This young gentleman, with a countenance like a boy, and the ambition of a giant, is about five feet, seven; reddish brown hair, smoothed aslant over his forehead; and fine eyes. He is at the head of the Everett school—a body of foolish young men, who have counterfeited his gesture, tone, carriage, and manner of wearing his hair. He is a man of fine talent---great pedantry;--a rambling sort of imagination, and a sickly taste for the ancient and obsolete. He is now the main conductor of the North American; or, rather, the head of a class, made up of rich young blockheads, whose fathers were rich old blockheads; patricians, graduated and patented, by the lump, at the University of Cambridge, who have been endured by the publick, in the high places of literature, till they really believe that they have a right there.—He was a clergyman, and would be a politician. I know nothing more of him. His works are brief essays on Architecture---Theology---Greece---Himself---and matters and things in general. He is a yankee, too, about thirty. He has a brother, who, I am told, is quite a poet---and an adventurer, in the most heroick meaning of the term. Pierpont.—This man is six feet high—thin—black hair—bushy eyebrows—dark, expressive eyes—about thirty-eight or forty—writes a hand like copperplate— talks remarkably well—but rather too sensibly—makes poetry in the same way, generally:—an imitator of Campbell, Beattie, and Darwin—with a talent equal, if not superiour, to either—and has been satisfied with doing about a thousand lines of very pure, agreeable, quiet rhyming, with, here and there, a magnificent burst of light, or a vivid picture, sparkling with regular vivacity —as much out of place— nine times out of ten—as an eruption of rockets would be, at a concert of flutes and pianos, where people look rather for “bottled velvet,” than Champaigne. He is a clergyman, now—was a merchant—after practising as a lawyer;—born in Connecticut, New-England. Thus you perceive that our literary men here, are nearly all New-Englanders, or YANKEES—and, generally, under the middle size. Dana.—Here is another of the amiable school, who, of late years, have made pure poetry so very commonplace; and all the pestilent inquietudes of life, so beautiful, in their patient yielding to them, that we have no heart to pity a man, though he be dying in a consumption, when we have once heard the comfort and consolation, attendant upon such a death, described by Percival or Dana. He is a yankee—light hair—light blue eyes— middle stature—feeble of health—and author of the Idle Man, a work of uncommon merit. He was the editor of the North American:—and was turned out, for writing the best thing that ever appeared in it—a review of your Hazlett on the British poets. Dana is a poet—but not one of them that dazzle and confound you, by their eagle flights—rushing, headlong, through the skies—nestling among the stars—and roosting with constellations. He is more swan-like; contented with floating over the blue waters of the wilderness, through sun and shadow, starlight and cloud—gathering wild flowers with his bosom, while he is drifting down the current—till he falls asleep in the ambush of his own nest—an entrenchment of water lilies and flowering weeds. He too, was educated for he bar. Percival—I don't know. But I hear that he is feeble of health—has been a doctor—a lawyer—and is about to be an editor. He is a Connecticut man, too. Walsh---Is a small, cold, sober, quaker-looking creature, having a good deal of unaffected simplicity about him, with a face well characterised; and, I should think, from the expression, a very good sort of a man. But more of him, by and bye. He is about five feet, six— rather deaf---pale---dark hair and eyes---wears spectacles---talks like a book, but without passion---and seems, generally, a good deal dissatisfied with all the world.--- I do not know him well---personally, I mean. He is a Marylander; and was intended for the bar. Walter.---This young man was little known. He had a brilliant, but confused beauty, at his heart;---a great deal of downright poetry, and was one of the most elegant men, in his manners, that I ever saw. I met him once in Boston. He was educated for the ministry; but there was more of the man of the world, in all his doings and sayings, than of one who should be set apart from it. His character was not fully developed when he died, although it was at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven. He was five feet, ten, at least---light brown hair---large hazle eyes---and a fine melancholy face. He wrote Sukey, and some smaller poems. He was born in Boston, and educated at Harvard. Good bye---I must throw by my pencil. E. MOLTON. I have opened this again, to add a P. S. P. S.—A friend of mine, (I am sure that I know the fellow, for nobody on earth dares to talk like him,) has just been giving your counsellor Phillips a dressing. I happened, accidentally, as I was about to fold this, to cast my eye upon the breakfast table, where several papers and letters had just been left, by the penny post; my eyes were attracted to a newspaper, by a column, that appeared to be made up of dashes, and exclamations. I took up the paper—read it—(it was the New England Galaxy—a newspaper, of which the editor, a precious chap---is one of our best and bravest, although, to be sure, they do call him a blackguard.) I knew the article immediately, and enclose it, herewith, for your amusement. Tell me, if you do not think the said counsellor, and the said counsellor's letter to the king, fairly treated. Phillips, I hold to be a compound of effort, imitation and pretence. Look at his imitations of Curran's playfulness, and pleasantry; sarcasm and sublimity. What monstrous carricatures they are. If Curran happen to be guilty of the possessive case, or of alliteration, Phillips will never be contented with less than a speech-full of both. If Curran speak of a buoyant pestilence, Phillips, on the first pretence, gives one a particular description of it, with the harbour regulations, and quarantine laws; all in superfine poetry. If Curran happen to quote a line of an old song, in some case of crim. con. we are sure tohear, line after line, song after song, from the counsellor, on the first case of crim. con. that he has the misfortune to be retained in; and that, too, with an inaptitude of illustration, so miserably conspicuous and obtrusive, that one cannot help pitying him. If Curran, roused and inflamed with indignation, discharges his great heart, in one volley of tempestuous heat, which terrifies and confounds us, like an exploding thunder-bolt, the counsellor is sure to lighten at us, all day long, when ever the title of the cause is the same—for any resemblance is precedent enough for him—yet, his lightning is never the sudden combustion of a great bosom, devoutly conscious of being inhabited by the Divinity, and exasperated with the goading and heat of its continual presence, into an unexpected eruption—but it is what we may call, a genteel illumination— a transparency—not the battle itself—but a picture of it, beautifully illuminated, with coloured gas—not the flash of the firmament, darkened with evolving thunder clouds, but set thick with glow worms and Chinese crackers. If Curran but take up the naked heart of some scoundrel witness; prepare to penetrate and explore it, even to the place where the black drop is lurking; dazzling and blinding us all the while, with the incessant play of a weapon, whose unspeakable brightness and edge, makes our blood tremble, counsellor Phillips will be sure to get hold of somebody's heart, no matter whose, nor when, nor where—and all the while, flourishing his dainty fingers about, like a lecturer upon nose-gays, set it all round with surgical instruments, and fire works---'till it look like a cutler's shop, on a birth night; a steel porcupine; or a barber's cushion, in a “new establishment.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Counsellor Philips always appears to me, when he is in a transport of eloquence, to be transported, secundum artem. He has persuaded himself, I am afraid, that losing one's subject in a speech, is equivalent to losing ones-self. I never can get the notion out of my head, when I hear him, (you have not forgotten the dinner at Brimstone Hall, and his oration, in reply to a toast from Carter) that he has committed a speech to memory--- and that, happen what may, he will be delivered of it. And yet, say what he will, and how he will, I am always in a sort of perplexity about his design;---and troubled, too, with a kind of insupportable gossipping pity and compassion---that wants the dignity of interest---just as if I were listening to a human creature, who was continually exposing himself, without suspecting it; to some poor fellow, who, having no command over himself, his thought, language, or organs of utterance, in publick, comes into a place where he is not wanted, after having prepared himself, brimful, of the wine and brightness of a great speech, for a great occasion---has begun to deliver it---exactly as he did not intend to---saying just what he meant not to say---and, in a tone of voice entirely different from what he intended---so as to give to sarcasm the force of explanation; and to playfulness the accent or outcry rather of a belaboured heart---jumbling all together--pell-mell---“pump or no pump” as Salmagundi says. Such are my notions of this man. I have often expressed them---and, allowing a little for exaggeration, I think that my good friend here, in rubbing down the counsellor, has had an eye to some of my extravagancies, at the same time. What think you, Stafford? Is it not a good deal in my manner? A little caricatured, perhaps; but, nevertheless, very like me. Counsellor Phillips.—With feelings of indignation that we cannot suppress, and that no honest man, who looks earnestly to the growth of a sound judgment among our young men, ought to suppress, even if he could, have we risen from the “Letter of Counsellor Phillips to the king.” Who can endure such stuff? Some may, but who can listen to the shameless, tasteless, unthinking and profligate applause that is lavished upon it. What is it? What are all his speeches?—Nothing more nor less than this—Splendid rigmarole—entangled and glittering rhapsody—without argument, without sinew, without bone, muscle or arrangement—a shining and fantastick assemblage of rattle-traps and pastework. Do we deny Charles Phillips genius? No—but it is the genius of delirium and infatuation. He is merely— merely a genius—he is destitute of talent. There is the bloom and the incense, but not the stamina of the true flower. He is a poet too—and his poetry is prose, and his prose poetry. Has he passion? No—He is only an actor—an actor too, who, were he playing the very Lears of the drama— sweating in agony beneath the load of his humiliation— aye, in the very tempest and whirlwind of his passion, would be completely disconcerted, if a feather swayed awry, or the moon went up the heavens un-picturesquely. He has been compared to Curran!—He! to Curran!— “Hyperion to a Satyr.” Powers of Eloquence! What has he of the Curran? of his wit! his genius? flashing its irradiations forever and ever?—What of his all-elevating eloquence? What of his passionate and tempestuous enthusiasm, that lifted up and swept away, as with the overpowering authority of inspiration, all hearts and heads, all judgments, spirits and intellects. Curran was a LAWYER. Phillips is not—and cannot be. He wants the edge—the adamant—all the powers of analysis—and decomposition. He wants other faculties. Curran's, it is true, was not the lawyer-like attitude of a colossus; eternal—immoveable; but it might have been. It was not, because he smote, and toiled, and battled for a nobler, higher and more glorious elevation; for that of the advocate. Curran was an Advocate. The explosions of his eloquence—unpremeditated—unlooked for—were, as if Paul, in the midst of Mars-Hill, or where he shook Agrippa upon his throne—had stretched forth his arm, —and cried, behold!—and as if, then—in the east, or in the west, or wherever he had pointed, some apparition had suddenly stood up, with its forehead in the sky—or chariots and horsemen were thundering in the air. But Charles Phillips!—could he do such things?— Never. The most fearful charm that he ever wrought before the heart of man, in mystery, passion, or enthusiasm, was the sickening, baby incantation of the nursery,—compared to Curran:—the contemptible trash of the witches of Macbeth, divested of its ferocious truth, and sparkling with conceit, compared with the wizard summoning of Prospero, in his cave, when the moon stands still in the sky—and the round earth quivers to the centre. Curran always forgot himself. Phillips never. Curran was an orator—Phillips a rhetorician. Curran could hold you, in spite of yourself, till all your faculties were gasping. Phillips never even intoxicates you—never elevates you—never makes you forget, either him, or yourself. And yet Charles Phillips has been classed—yes, yes!—Charles Phillips!—with John Philpot Curran. As I hope for mercy, the only thing I know in favour of counsellor Phillips is, that John Philpot Curran used to permit him to sit at his table. Curran rode the thoroughly trained war-horse—hoof, muscle and limb for the trial—husbanding his wind—his great heart quaking to meet the battle. Phillips frisks about upon an ill-broken colt, eternally kicking up his heels and entangling his hoofs in his trappings and finery—or running himself to death, like Bucephalus, from a shadow. Curran is an eagle—breaking through the thickest cloud, with one clap of his resounding pinions—washing—purifying—drenching himself in the fiercest element of heaven—a spirit baptized in fire—Phillips—O, what is Charles Phillips—a hair brained poet—a humming bird, a glittering insect, bathed in dew, revelling in perfume, sparkling from head to tail, with twinkling ornament— and buzzing and blundering about, without aim or object, except to be heard and seen. And yet Charles Phillips's speeches are spoken of, as— the creation of feeling and eloquence. God of heaven! what a profanation. Feeling!—the man never felt except for a mis-printed sentence—or an unmusical termination. His feeling is mawkish sentimentality—the whimpering, lack-a-daisical stuff of song books.—Not the loud pulsation of a heart suffocating in its own thought—festering in its own indignation, or dissolving in the sympathy of godlike natures. His eloquence!—it is froth and flummery. His style of writing holds about the same relation to Eloquence, that the tones of a Cremona do, to the rolling organ or the rattling thunder. Look at the effect. Hear Curran for a moment—on he goes, fearless and proud in his stepping, his heart gushing out with the pure element of his thought—suddenly his eye quickens! it flashes fire! his form contracts—his action is hurried—an overwhelming burst of eloquence succeeds! —filling all hearts, shaking all bosoms, thrilling every artery of your frame—as if a cloud had passed over your heads, for a moment, charged with the electricity and the reverberation of heaven. You look back upon your feelings. You are on a dizzy and perilous height—but you can trace your course—you can see how you got there. You are not ashamed of your nature—or of yourself— you are proud of the transport that you have felt; glad that you were capable of acting and thinking with such generous madness:—and glorying in your relationship to a creature, so capable of moving heaven and earth, as it would seem. But how is it with Phillips. You rise, heated—not by overwrought enthusiasm—but heated, and feverish, ashamed of yourself, emasculated, dastardly; with a general sense of weariness, lassitude and oppression, as of excessive indulgence, satiety and self dissatisfaction—as one would feel, who had broken a tedious fast upon sweetmeats,—or been imprisoned all night long with singing birds—in some milliner's shop. Let Curran be summoned from his grave. Bid him walk into the council chamber of his sovereign, and lift up his voice in behalf of the woman of sorrow. Would you hear any of this endless sing-song—see any of this eternal twinkling—of metaphor and foppery? No. You would not see a creature decked out in tinsel and O paste work, from head to foot, perpetually writhing himself into attitudes—and flourishing his arms, and nodding his head, merely because, when he nodded, there was a scintillation of spangles about his “baby brow”— and because when he tossed his arms upward, his robe threw out a few changeable corruscations, for the mob to wonder at!—No!—But you would hear a deep voice—an awful silence would surround you—every pulsation of your heart would be counted. You would see a man, standing like the prophet when he rebuked the waters; and the kingly tides went rolling backward, encumbered with horse and horsemen, banner and chariot. You would see a hand-writing upon the sky---and you would believe, whil you heard in imagination, the Angel, the Exterminator placing his foot upon the East and upon the West, and preparing to pour out his vial---you would believe that “already” the kingdom had departed from George---and the sceptre from the house of Hanover. You would stand too---like him of old---who saw his fellow man swept upward to the everlasting skies, in a whirlwind of dust and fire---you would be prostrate and breathless---bowed down, and blind with apprehension and dismay. Thus would you feel, were Curran to address his sovereign. But how feel you now, when Phillips does this? Oh, it is sacrilege to compare such men!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN OMAR TO SARAH RAMSAY. I have been away ever since the night when I saw Molton; and I have just left him again, having heard the rest of his story. Will you hear it? You say, if I remember right, that his first offence was—stay, I will refer to the letter itself; lay it open before me, and answer it, in my usual way, line by line. Sarah—you must wait. I have lost your letters,—or, what is worse, left them in Molton's study. What if he should see them!—I will go this instant. Heaven be praised! Sarah—I have them again—untouched—unprofaned. Molton had followed me out, it appears: and there lay the letters, folded, one within the other, just as I left them, on the table. I beg ten thousand pardons for my carelessness—but I was afraid to leave them at home, and have carried them always about me. I took them out there, merely to see how his story, and that which you have heard, would correspond; and that I might refer to them, if necessary, to refresh my memory. But let me proceed. I entered, abruptly, upon the subject of my visit. I told him that I would not be his friend at halves,—that I respected him, and desired to respect him. It was later than I intended;—and he took out his watch, with a serious air, and laid it upon the table before him. I asked no questions, but began, and went through, without flinching, the whole that I had heard. His countenance never changed,---once, only excepted, when I thought that he smiled inwardly. “Do you believe the stories?” he said calmly. What could I say? I did not believe them. I told him so. He smiled. “Mr. Omar,” said he, “this will be a lesson to you. What you have heard, is from good authority;—yet, you have dared to believe it untrue. On what evidence, I do not ask you. It is enough for me that you believe me innocent. Had you believed me guilty, you would have gone home as you came. I should have disdained to reply. Do you fully acquit me?” I bowed—I know not why; for I saw something sarcastick, in his manner, such as I would use to a petulent, inquisitive boy---to one that I was making a fool of. There was a dead silence. His face grew more solemn and pale. He looked me full in the eyes;—laid both of his hands upon the table, and pronounced these words, deliberately, in a low voice, that I shall never forget, never, to my dying day—“The stories are true.” Was he mad?—I looked at him in amazement. Was it his voice? I know not. It did not sound like his; nor had I ever heard aught that resembled it, from Molton. “Mr. Omar,” said he—(at the sound of his voice then; I recovered instantly from my consternation.) He took no notice of my surprise; and I began to doubt if my ears had not deceived me. “Mr. Omar---the stories are true.” I started from my seat. Nay—I was on the point of striking him. I raised my arm,—but he struck it down, lifeless, at my side. “Boy,” said he, “sit down. Had that blow alighted on me, you had been a corpse, at this moment. Sit down, and hear me. The stories, even as you have them, are from my own lips. I betrayed myself. The secret was my own—but I chose to betray it.” I shuddered—my whole side was numb. And I sat before him, like something helpless, and at his mercy. I shall now endeavour to give you a faithful account of all that passed between us, at this interview; and I would have you reflect on the character, that he betrayed in his reasoning. “Yet, you must listen to my account of the same transactions,” said he. “You shall. But beware how you lift your hand against me.—A blow, I cannot endure. I have sworn never to endure it, again; and I never will. If you are angry with me, strike me to the heart. There lies my sword. There are my pistols.--- I am weary of life. I will uncover my breast to you. I will not defend myself. But, again, do I say to you, John Omar, as you value your own life, do not lift your hand, to give me a blow. It has cost more than one man dearly, already. But, to the point. I thank you for putting your question home, without circumlocution or apology. It shows that you have a good opinion, at least, of my temper and self command.” “Nay,” said I, interrupting him, “even more than that; it shows that I do not believe what I have heard. No man, if he believed that another was a villain, could speak to him on the subject, without hesitation. He would falter—.” “You did falter,” rejoined Molton. “But, no matter for that. You have, on the whole, dared to tell me, what the world has thought proper to say of me. And, although it is very true, that, by asking me, directly, if I be guilty or not guilty, you manifest much confidence in me; and much more than you would have done, by coming at me with a side wind; yet, after all, your very question might have been an insult.” “An insult! how so? I do not believe what I have heard.” “Not entirely, you should say,” he replied; “but, to a certain degree, you must believe it, or you would repel the whole, at once, with indignation. Would it not be an insult, think you, to ask a woman if she is virtuous?” “Why----to be sure----it—but I do not ask you any such question. I only tell you what they say of you, abroad.” “True. But do you not watch my countenance, all the while; and do you not look to hear me defend myself, indignantly, with the vehement courage of an injured and insulted man.” “To be sure---but then, I do this, that I may be able to defend you, myself.” “To defend me! What would a modest woman say to a champion, that would throw down a gauntlet in the same way, in defence of her reputation? Would it not be an insult?” “Not, if her reputation were attacked.” “I beg your pardon. The highest and most unapproachable purity, is only dishonoured by it:---a second rate purity may be honoured by it. Were I, in your estimation, utterly guiltless, you would mock at these tales; and deride them, as the clumsy invention of idle and wicked gossips. But being, what I am, not utterly guiltless, in your own estimation, but only guilty in a less degree, you have had the courage to tell me what people say, in a manner that convinces me of your respect. Not mentioning it at all, would have been the proof, that you held me to be wholly guilty, or wholly innocent.—But what is the matter? You look puzzled.” “I am puzzled; I confess it. And yet, an illustration occurs to me that—but illustration is not argument.” O 2 “I beg your pardon: illustration is analogy; and what is analogy, but argument? But no matter about that, for the present. Let us hear your illustration.” “Well then---it was to this effect. Suppose that I had heard George Washington charged with habitual drunkenness; and suppose that I was intimate with him, as I am with you. I should scorn to reply to such a charge. I should never mention it to him, at all, in all probability; and, certainly, never, as I have mentioned these matters to you, watching his countenance all the while. You smile. You are preparing to overthrow me entirely. I see it in your eyes;---and, I believe, unless I very much mistake your character, that you would not care what became of your own hypothesis, while you were demolishing my illustration. Is it not so? What say you?” “Never mind. Go on—finish your illustration.” “Thank you. I feel it like a reprieve. I was about to say, then, that, if I had heard Washington charged with having been, on some one occasion, drunk, instead of being habitually so, I should, were I his friend, probably enter into a defence of him, with great warmth; and, probably, on some occasion or other, ask him about the truth of it. And why? Because I might believe the latter charge to be possible. This confirms your doctrine. I believe, that you are possibly guilty in some degree. But did I believe you altogether guilty, or not at all so, then I should never have mentioned the matter to you. In the first place, I should not dare to mention it; and, in the latter, I should scorn to.—But, what are you musing about?” “I can hardly tell you,” said he, after a pause. “A strange hypothesis, that I cannot immediately master, is disturbing me. At some future period, we will have some talk about it. It is an alarming paradox, and, if I am right, will explain certain operations of our mind, that have been, for a long time, unintelligible to our metaphysicians.” “Pray, what is it?” “In one word, then, it is—but we cannot, well, discuss it, now. It is, that the more improbable a story is, the more probable it is. I am very serious. I state it as a paradox; and, at present, omit all its qualifications and exceptions. People that lie, are often, nay, generally, more plausible than others. You will hear a man of veracity tell a common story, so as to look suspicious;---- while an habitual liar will make up a very uncommon story, that shall appear probable. The former disdains all trick; he has never been doubted; and he never troubles himself to ask, if what he relates be probable. But the latter seeks to make whatever he may tell, probable in the minutest particular. He is full of circumstantiality; he gives place, time, and language. It is a well known mark of suspicion, in courts of justice, that the story of a witness is very particular, consistent, and circumstantial. It looks like a prepared thing. And men of experience know, that a witness upon the stand, if he be very scrupulous and honest, is much more liable to contradict himself, and to become embarrassed, than the perjured scoundrel. The former will hesitate, and qualify, and weigh; where the latter swears it out, roundly, promptly, and without any embarrassment.” “A man that makes up a lie, then, will make it probable. To my notion, then, a story is more likely to be true, from the very want of plausibility upon the face of it. Liars are ingenious and ready. If a man should say to me, therefore, that Washington was habitually intemperate, I should be more apt to believe that he was telling the truth, than if he should sit down and tell me a long and particular story, about having seen him drunk on some one occasion; and how he was dressed; and what he said and did; and when it was, and where; and who was there, &amp;c. &amp;c. So that, to despatch this affair, at once, it would seem, that a story may be the more probable for its very improbability!” There, Sarah, I think that I have given you a fair sample of Molton's manner, when he trifles, with that air of earnest pleasantry, for which he is so remarkable; and, now, I will attempt to repeat the remainder of our conversation. After a few moments, he turned toward me, again; and addressed me, as nearly as I can recollect, in the very words following. “The first story that you heard is true. When I was a boy, between 16 and 17 years of age, I was a kind of under-strapper in a large store; and lived at the house of my master. A very pretty, or rather, a very good-looking girl, a relation of the family, was on a visit there, at the same time. For a week or two, when we were alone, she was rather condescending; and used to talk to me, very graciously, about novel-reading. At last, she prayed me to borrow one, called Ariel, from a friend of her's, promising to lend it to me, when she had done with it. I borrowed the book, and was very impatient to read it; for I read with exceeding avidity, whatever came in my way. She read very slowly, and I, with uncommon rapidity.” “One evening, after tea, there came a barrel of Medford crackers, to the house; which, for some reason or other, was put into the closet of this girl's room. I held the candle, I remember; and while they were stowing away the barrel, I saw the novel lying on the mantle-piece.” “The next day, while I was at the store, a sudden desire took hold of me, to eat one of the “Medford crackers.” I cast about, for some time, to see how I should manage the matter; and at last, determined to run home for a moment; go up to my chamber, which opened into the same landing with her's; and, if I found her door open, as it generally was, in the day time, to slip into her room, and get a supply. I am too old, now, to laugh at such things, or to wonder at any thing; or else, I should say that I never knew an example of childish infatuation like mine. I was not hungry. I had enough to eat, and of the best quality. Yet, so it was; I had a longing, such I suppose, as women have at times, and green girls for blue clay, chalk and charcoal; and I determined to gratify it. I went home; and, as I passed the parlour, I saw somebody, whom I took to be the girl in question, with a baby in her arms. I was certain that it was she. I saw her as plainly as I now see you; and I would have sworn that it was she. I hurried up stairs, stepped softly through my room, and found the door of her's, contrary to what I had observed, whenever I had occasion to go to my chamber in the day time, shut. I attempted to turn the handle very softly—succeeded; and was opening it, gradually, inch by inch, for fear of being heard; when, somebody, a woman too, about half dressed, sprang toward it, and shut it violently in my face; but, unluckily, not without seeing me.” “And here, by the way, I have a hint to give, which may be useful, one day or other, to some unhappy fellow, in a like predicament. Doors are apt to creak;—there are two ways of preventing it—lift, or bear down upon the latch; and open or shut it, swiftly. But, if neither will do, follow my example—mew faintly, like a cat; or make a noise like a sleeper, snoring; do this, and you will be safe, any where, provided you keep time with the creaking of the door. But let me return to the crackers. My heart, itself had well nigh exploded with shame. I was innocent, but appearances were enough to hang me.” “What could I do? My trepidation was excessive.— Not that I feared any living creature, in the way of personal chastisement; but I was terrified to the heart, at the thought of what the poor girl might imagine. I returned to the store, in a strange state of consternation and perplexity;—I knew that I should be questioned about the matter; and I knew, too, that the plain truth would be vastly more improbable, than a lie, which I could put together in two minutes. It turned out as I expected. The good woman of the house, after stuffing me to the throat, with dainties, to detain me, till all the rest had left the room, at dinner, put the affair home to me, at once; asking me, while her own face coloured and shook, and mine burnt as if a furnace were before me, “what I wanted in Miss Harriott's room?” “I was afraid to tell the truth, as I have already said; I knew that it would'nt be believed: and I was ashamed to mention the crackers. So I told her a story, of which this (I do not, of course, remember the words) was the substance.” “I went there for a book, Madam. Miss Harriott promised to lend me Ariel, the other day; and I did not like to keep asking her for it, continually. I could read it through, in a few hours; and, last night, when I went to hold the candle, while the crackers were put into her closet, (or, to put them into the closet, while somebody else held the candle) I saw the book lying over the fire-place. To-day, while I was up stairs, having little or nothing to do, it occurred to me that I could slip into her room, if I found it open; take away the book; read it; and return it, before it was missed. I saw her below ma'm, as I thought, when I went up to my room; and, it was for that reason, that I ventured to open the door,” &amp;c. &amp;c. “This story was believed, this lie, I ought to say, when the truth would not have been. They knew that I was passionately fond of reading; but they did not know that I was at all, fond of Medford crackers. The account was probable, from my pride, age, and manner; for my pride and manner were those of a man. I had no more trouble about the matter; but, I dare say, that it is remembered; and I am glad of an opportunity to tell the plain truth. It is a relief to me.” I believe him, Sarah; it appeared to be a relief to him. “But”—he continued, “the next affair is one, that I am unwilling to talk about; and I know not if I would condescend to exculpate myself, were it not that an elder brother, of the poor little girl in question, has thought proper to put her reputation at issue. He told one person, at least; and perhaps more than one, that I was a dependant in the family; under great obligations to every member of it; that his sister was a mere child; that I took advantage of her innocent nature, so far as to go to her bed-side, at night, and kiss her. He is a liar, and a fool.” “He is a liar, for I was never, in any way, a dependant of the family. They are all under greater obligations to me, than I to them. I laboured for them; and, in the wreck of extensive commercial dealing, the profits of my labour went to the support of three of their families at least. I came out of the concern a beggar. So did this brother, to be sure. But his mother's family were greatly benefitted; made, in a measure independent, by an application of the partnership funds. I do not say that it was dishonestly done. I know that it was not. But—I know also that I was alone; and that my family were not benefitted; but that I lost, and, that they lost, all that both were worth, while the family of this very man, grew comfortable by our labour. He is a liar. I was not in a state of dependence for a moment. I paid my board, at the highest price too, continually and regularly; and was generally in advance, to the very family where this transaction happened. He is a liar. His sister was not a child, when the affair happened. She was fourteen years old, (I believe) and large of her age. She had the appearance of a fresh, healthy girl of sixteen. He is a liar. I did not kiss her.—I never kissed her in my life. I did not take advantage of my situation; if I had chosen to, nothing could have saved her. I do not say this, out of disrespect to her, or unkindness; but, because it is the truth. No young, careless girl could have withstood me, if I had been a scoundrel, with the opportunities that I had.” “He is a fool—for he knows me. He knows that I will not bear, very patiently, with such presumption. He knows that I am not to be trifled with; or, if he do not already know it, he and his whole family shall know it, in a way that they do not apprehend. He is a fool; inasmuch as he has told a secret, that would have been untold, but for him, and one other man; as mistaken as himself; a secret that concerned his own sister. Fool! mad man! who will believe him! who, that knows me, will believe that I contented myself with kissing a woman, whom I had found in bed, at midnight; who will believe that the hostility of the family grew out of an incident so trivial? Nobody. But for me, then, where would be the reputation of his young and innocent sister? It would be, at this moment, irretrievably blasted, by the tattling of her own brother, were it not that the man whom he has attempted to ruin—by poisoning his reputation, at the very moment that he was intimate with him—is willing to bear testimony to her innocence.” “And who told the truth, at last? How came the brother to know it at all? I was not suspected. The family treated me most kindly and affectionately, long after it had happened. I visited the mother; I lived with her for weeks; I took up my abode with her brothers and sisters; and yet I was undreamt of. Aye, who told the truth at last? It was I. Yes!—I—and what object had I to gain? Nothing but this—I was determined to give the last and greatest proof, of my repentance and reformation.” “And what was the consequence? How was it received? I'll tell you, Omar. It will teach you caution. It will convince you that, with men, it is safer to be a villain than to appear so; that it is easy and advantageous to deceive, but very perilous to undeceive; that, while a man is a scoundrel, if he be not a fool, he can escape suspicion; but that, the moment that he proves himself honester than his neighbour, by acknowledging his most hidden transgression, and turning witness against himself, he is a banished and ruined man; banished from all hearts, and ruined in all opinions.” “You are a young man. I call you so, because, whatever may be the number of years that you have lived, you are altogether younger than I am. It may be well for you, to understand how continually, yet how secretly, our self-love is at work. A thousand contradictory phenomena may be traced to that little passion. We cannot endure to think humbly of our own judgment. It is painful to acknowledge that we have been deceived—and, therefore, we persist against all evidence, frequently, in maintaining any opinion that we have once been heard to express. How reluctantly do we listen to, and how unwilling we are to believe anything against a favourite. It is amusing to see how ingenious we are in escaping conviction—how industrious and sensible, in accounting for all that he may have done, said, or thought amiss.— Now this would be very amiable, and ought to make one in love with human nature, a man would be apt to think. But hearken a moment. The same benevolent creature, who will not hear you open your mouth against a friend, will not hear you open it in favour of an enemy. And why? Is it that he is too generous, too like a philanthropist in the former case? Or that he is too wicked in the latter? No such thing. It is an impeachment of his own judgment, against which he braces himself. He is only withstanding the overthrow of his own opinion, and nothing more. It is humbling to be convinced, that he has been a fool or a bad man:—a fool, if he have acted without evidence, in his love or his hatred; and a bad man, if he have acted against it. Such is the character of man. I know it. I knew it from the first: and, therefore, I strive not, to convince men that I was not so bad as they believed; because, if I succeeded, which would be a miracle, for it would involve their own self condemnation—what should I gain by it? Nothing—nothing— but the hasty acquittal of men, whose condemnation were hardly worse, than their praise.” “In a few moments, you will be master of the whole story. You will wonder then, at my infatuation. You will ask if I repent of it. I shall answer you—no! I do not. What I told then, I would tell now. I did it to recover my own respect, not that of other men; to make peace with a troubled spirit—a proud and unforgiving nature;—but it was no other nature, and no other spirit, than my own. I had no one to appease, but myself;—for, to no one, upon the earth, was my transgression known.” “I told the truth to my friend—to my dearest friend. What did he? Did he ask leave to communicate it? No! But he did communicate it. And why? Could it make them wiser, or better? Could it do any good? Yes! he told them—and without letting me know of it; so that I was subjected to the chance of continual insult from them. And yet, this very brother, of whom I have just spoken, he, who, in his gossipping, childish confidence has put the character of his own sister in jeopardy, met me, and journeyed with me, day after day, with the most cordial expression of good will, after he knew the whole story; and was scoundrel enough, and coward enough, to assail my reputation, secretly, at the same time, by falsehood and misrepresentation. Nay, I might have been led to visit the family, without any suspicion of the change, by the concealment of the first person, that he had betrayed me; and by the abject duplicity of the latter; and then, in all P probability, there would have been blood shed;—for, by the living God! I would have struck to the earth, any of the sons, or brothers, who should have dared to treat me, to my face, as they have treated me at a distance.” “And now, to my defence. The poor girl, I shall spare; but, I shall spare her for her own sake, not for theirs. I never think of her, but with respect and emotion. I shall prove that, bad as I am—I cannot injure her, as her brothers have. My wickedness will not do, what their folly would, if it were not neutralised by me.” “I am charged with attempting the deliberate seduction of a child. That is the substance of the charge.” “Omar, it might be a full reply to this charge, were I to appeal to my life. It has been a long one, and full of self-denial, in relation to women. I have led many into peril; but I never availed myself of it. Yet, of this, I have no witness; and I disdain to use asseveration.” “When I first saw this child, she was a pretty little creature, about eleven years old, I believe. She became very fond of me; and I loved her, as I would have loved my own sister. She had an innocent and caressing way with her; was remarkably affectionate; and, to my thought, felt, even at that age, with more of the feeling of a woman, than of a child.” “Some years afterward, I met her again. She had grown tall and ugly; was careless in her appearance, awkward, hoyden-like, and slovenly. I remonstrated with her; I taught her to write and draw. I had continual opportunity to profit of her unsuspicious, grateful temper; but I forbore. I never toyed with her. I never trifled with her; I never romped with her; I never kissed her; and I never attempted any liberties with her. I will not say, that, while directing her, in her drawing or writing lesson, I may not have laid my hand over her lap, or half encircled her waist, with my arm, as she leaned over me. She betrayed her feeling toward me, in several ways; once, when we first met, after a separation of two or three years, by catching my hand and kissing it, as we both stooped, at the same moment, to pick up something that one of us had dropped; and, many times, by coming into my chamber, which was opposite to her own, and challenging me, by her countenance and hilarity, to a game of romps: not by words—that she never did; for she was afraid of me, and more afraid of my opinion.” “For a long time, we lived together in the same house. Her chamber and mine were so situated, that I continually passed her door, when I went to bed, and when I rose. She knew this, of course; yet, so neglectful was she of propriety; or so indifferent to it, that I have seen her, again and again, dressing and undressing, night and morning, often, when the door was ajar; and, once or twice, through the key-hole. You look indignant; look so—I do not blame you. I am no listener at key-holes; but I hold it to be something brutish and insensible, to pass by any opportunity of seeing a beautiful woman, (nature's masterpiece,) naked, without profiting by it. “More than once, have I seen that child lying, in the moonlight, almost naked; or, of a warm summer morning, in her quiet, untroubled innocence and security; and I have stood and contemplated her, with a feeling more nearly allied to religion, than to impurity.” “One night, she was terrified in her sleep; and left her bed, precipitately; ran into a neighbouring chamber, and crept into bed, with an old negro woman, to whom she declared that a black man had been attempting to strangle her. I heard the story at the time, and laughed at it, as the dreaming of a child. But, at last, I learned to avail myself of it, in my own defence. It was nearly a year after her fright; and happened somewhat after this fashion. I had seen her naked, no matter how nor where; and I had good reason to believe that she knew it, at the time. Nay, I still believe so. Some other suspicion entered my heart, about the same time; of what nature, I need not declare, since I am perfectly satisfied that her thought, like my own, was innocent. As I lay meditating on the whole of my acquaintance with her, a strange curiosity arose in my heart, to ascertain the truth of my conjecture. My plan was immediately formed, and deliberately executed; but, with no disposition to injure the poor girl; far less, with any thought of her dishonour. I meant to give her, as I have given more than one woman, a lesson, that she would never forget. I did not mean to sacrifice her; but I meant to place her in such a situation, that she would have been in my power:---what I mean by, being in my power, is only, that she should not dare, on her own account, to call out, or resist me.” “I went to her bed. I lay down by her side, and put my arm, very gently, over her, so that it rested upon a little child, that slept with her at the time. And this reminds me of another of her little imprudencies. While she was in bed, the uncle of the child used to go up, and take it out of her arms, and whip it; and this uncle was a young man, and no relation of her's, either by blood or marriage.” “She awoke, and asked “who's this?” I did not reply, because I thought that she might mistake me for her usual companion, a woman who grew somewhat accustomed to familiarity, before she married the scoundrel, who has driven me to this defence.” “She was terrified, and repeated the question. I had no other object to answer. I had ascertained that she neither wished for me, nor expected me; and I assure you that, till I had tried the experiment, I did believe both. Her friends ought to thank me for having ascertained the truth, and vindicated her purity from all suspicion. I arose, immediately, and returned to my room. But hardly had I thrown myself into my own bed, when I heard her cries. They alarmed me. For the first time, I began to tremble for the consequences of my own intemperate and wicked curiosity. I opened my door, and she threw herself into my arms, gasping for breath, and shaking from head to foot. I asked her what was the matter. “O, there's a man in my room! there's a man in my room!” she kept continually repeating. I pretended to search the room, while she ran down stairs, and jumped into bed with a man and his wife; and there lay, poor creature, quaking all night long. The search for the man was in vain, of course.” “It is wonderful how accident will oftentimes befriend the villain. My door I had purposely left open, two or three nights before, under pretence of carrying off the smoke and smell of the charcoal, which arose from the wood that I was in the habit of burying every night, in the ashes, that I might have a good bed of coals in the morning; but, in reality, to facilitate my escape, if there should be any outcry. On this very night, it so happened that one of the servants, in passing my room, saw the light of her candle flash upon the further wall of my chamber, opposite to the door; and mentioned it. To this, my practice, of late, to leave the door open, was a complete reply.” “I had taken care to shut the door of the girl's room, when I entered, lest some person might pass, while it was open, and suspect something. The consequence was, that I had to open and shut it, on returning; two things that I foresaw might give me trouble, if any alarm should happen before. But mark my good fortune. Nobody could open the door without making some noise; although he should open it, as I did, softly for a moment, and then, very swiftly. A lady who slept below, maintained, that the whole was another dream of the poor girl's: and declared that she had been wide awake all the while; that she heard her cry out, who's this; and all the subsequent confusion; but that there was no door opened or shut. “Of that she was positive!” The poor girl, on the contrary, maintained that it was opened and shut, with some violence. She was mistaken—both were mistaken—but, in the mean time, I escaped. Their contradiction neutralised the testimony of each. I was particular in shutting it, though she was at my heels, lest she might see me enter my own room, which was exactly opposite to her's, but I shut it very softly.” “There was another fact. The poor girl said, that she felt the beard of a man, when she put up her hand, and touched his face; and that it was very strong and harsh. I remembered that she had touched my face, and took care to shave, very closely, the next morning, before I appeared. My smooth chin I dare say, was observed. Then, if you add to this, that she had been just as badly frightened before, by nothing at all, you will not wonder that, after all, considering the infirmity of human testimony, P 2 I was not even suspected, except, perhaps, by the girl herself; who, I believe, regarded it, if she did suspect me, as a frolick!” “The affair, as I tell you, passed over, without any attention; and no living creature could ever have known the truth, but for me. At length, I began to feel some distress about the matter. I was afraid that the poor girl might be troubled all her life, to determine whether the whole was an apparition or a reality. I was unwilling to let her suffer in that way; and equally unwilling to tell the truth. And why? Because the plain truth would be less probable, I knew, than a lie, such as I could readily invent. I chose the latter, and told it to her own brother-in-law, my most intimate friend, a good and wise man. He knew me, and believed me; and pledged his own faith for my veracity. The family continued to treat me as usual. I visited them all, and was beloved and respected by all. This pained me. My blood was troubled. I felt that I did not deserve it; and I could hardly refrain from telling the truth, many a time, when the thought came over me. Was that man to blame? No! He was deceived; and deceived by a man who never attempted to deceive, in vain; by a man who could, and can deceive any human being; by one, to whom many years are but as a single day, if his purpose be deception---by myself.--The story that I told, was this:—I acknowledged that it was I, myself, who visited her in bed—but I told him, at the same time, that it happened in my sleep.” “You have not forgotten,” said I, “that, when I was in love with Mary-Ann, (one of my early flames,) that Joe (the blockhead who is the author of all this mischief) endeavoured, continually, to discourage my affection for her, chiefly by ridiculing my confidence in her; nor have you forgotten, that I tore her from my heart, forever, in consequence of her having permitted him to kiss her. I never forgave him for it, of course, although the attempt was made with my own approbation.” “You know, too,” I continued, “that his present wife slept in the same bed, frequently, with the girl, of whom we have been speaking; that, on the very night when this affair took place, Joe was married to her.” “Now, these things were all true, Mr. Omar, and he knew them to be so:—but listen to the remainder of my story.” “This same Joe, by the way, I may as well give you some notion of. He is the most unprincipled and contemptible profligate, that I ever saw; and, either the greatest liar, or the most successful villain, among women, upon earth. I know not how he used to succeed as he did; but that he did succeed, to a certain degree, sometimes, I know, of my own knowledge. The sum of his fascination; and his manner of fondling and whining himself into the hearts of women, I am perfectly familiar with. He danced prettily; wore pomatum in his hair; affected to be quite miserable, and sentimental, and very affectionate; quoted poetry; and particularly a versification of Sterne's Maria, and some lines from Camoens, in that devilish lackadaisical manner, which to some women is perfectly irresistible;—a part of the last, I can remember.” “For I was made in joy's despite, “And meant for misery's slave; “And all my hours of brief delight, “Fled, like the speedy winds of night, “Which soon shall wheel their sullen flight, “Across my grave!” “You have no idea of the effect produced upon the women of his intimate acquaintance, by the occasional repetition of these lines. Those who could not understand the poetry, understood the tone—and all were deeply affected. They wept with him, pitied him, either sobbed upon his bosom, or let him sob upon theirs; nay, some of them went into “a melancholy;” one grew very thin, to my knowledge, and another very fat; the latter of whom, he secretly married; and that too, after swearing to me, that he would not think of such a thing, without consulting me. It was that man, who first reconciled me to the company of abandoned women. Thus much for his character, Mr. Omar; and now, for the tale that I told, in my own defence, interweaving much truth, with much falsehood, merely that the poor girl might not be under a delusion all her life, in the matter; and that I might not be utterly reprobate in their opinion.” “I lay that night,” said I, (the night of his marriage,) “ruminating on my past life; recalling my early love, which he had turned to bitterness; I remembered the pang that it gave my heart, when he told me that he had succeeded; and, while I remembered it, I fell asleep; for so vividly and strangely interwoven were the imaginary and the real, throughout the whole of the adventure, that they cannot, even now, be separated in my recollection. He came to me, I thought, and I reproached him, for having drugged my wine-cup with poison. He defended himself on the ground, that he had done it with my permission. We wrangled for some time, until he, himself, as I thought, proposed that I should make the same attempt upon the woman of his heart, who lay in the next room. I arose, and went to her bed, and lay down by her side, as I thought; nor did I awake, till I heard a loud outcry; which, when I first awoke, and found myself in bed with another person, in a strange place, was more like a dream to me, than any thing that had passed. At length, however, I remembered enough to assist me in recovering my own room, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.” “That, Mr. Omar, is the substance of my story. It was believed, as I have already told you, and by one, who knew me, most intimately; and why? because it was probable. He knew that I had never taken any liberties with the poor girl; that I had never corrupted, nor sought to corrupt her; that I was not a sensualist nor a profligate; that I had lost my early love, in the way that I mentioned; that Joe was married in the night, when the affair took place; and that his wife did sleep, frequently, in the same bed with the girl. Therefore, as I have told you, he believed me. But, had I told the truth, he would not have believed me. It was too improbable. Do you doubt this? I appeal to fact. I did tell him the truth, the simple, unadulterated truth, afterward, freely, and of my own accord; yet, he did not believe me.” “Yes—the account that I gave, was believed. But, what of that? my conscience grew uneasy. I had told a lie. That was nothing; I cared little for that, then. I regarded it as a legitimate and lawful exercise of my imagination, like writing a novel or a poem. But, the thing that pained me, was, a doubt of my own motive. I had deceived one, that loved and respected me. It lay heavily at my heart, until I had added two or three more deceptions to it; when, all at once, they became insupportable. They would have crushed me; but I arose, with a convulsive effort, and threw them off, forever. I told the truth. I turned self-accuser, before a mortal tribunal. I disdained to parley with dishonour. I denounced Edward Molton, with my own mouth. Who thanked me for it? Who thought the better of me for it? Nobody—nobody!—John Omar, look at me— if I would, I might be ten times the villain that I am, or ever have been, and pass through life, unsuspected. You look upon me with amazement. You wonder at my infatuation. You would ask what I can hope to gain, by laying bare my whole heart, before the uncharitable and distrustful; before them, whose very self-love will prevent them from respecting me, when they find how they have been deceived. My answer is a very simple one. I have done my duty; and whatever I hold to be my duty, that will I do, whatever happen. I have learnt to disregard all other considerations, of late.” “Can it be your duty,” said I, after a pause, “to publish the shame of a family, with whom you have been so intimate?—to put in jeopardy, the peace of a woman, who, whatever might have been the character of her husband, is now tranquil, and respectable, and unsuspected?” “Yes.—It is my duty. Her husband has driven me to it. He has presumed too much upon my patience; and, not only he, but his whole family. He, in particular, has, almost while I held his hand in mine, sought to damn my reputation, secretly. Let him take the consequences. By showing that he is a profligate, and a liar, I can best defend myself from his aspersions. I feel no hostility to many of the females; but—wo to the men, if they provoke me. My character shall not go down to my children profaned—wo to them that compel me to stand at bay. I will execute justice upon them.” I was alarmed at his countenance; it was full of unsparing denunciation. “Justice!” said I—“it is vengeance.” “Be it vengeance, then. Call it what you please. My own heart tells me that I am doing rightly; that I have forborne too long;—so long, that, unless I awake and prostrate my assailants, I may be bound down, and imprisoned, forever, like Gullivar, with cobweb; which, had I not slept too soundly, might have been broken asunder, by a breath.—I—.” He stopped suddenly.—I looked up. His eyes were rivetted upon the clock. It wanted five minutes of twelve. Not another word was spoken, till it struck twelve. Never did I endure such an awful silence. His eyes were shining and motionless; and his lips open, as if he were some criminal, a waiting his doom, and feeling its approach, in every beat of his pulse—if his pulse did beat—for mine stopped;—and the clock, too—that appeared to stand still, for a time. He then turned slowly toward me, and demanded if I would take a bed with him. “Your room is just as you left it;—you are our only guest,—our only material guest, I should say;—dare you sit with me for one hour longer— no more?” “Dare I—? I do not understand.” He did not appear to heed my reply;—and I repeated it. “Yes, sir—dare you? Dare you sit up, face to face, with a—with a mortal man, when his countenance, looks like mine—at this moment;—moves like mine —is bleached and blasted—stained like mine—Sir —my friend—Omar—do not leave me alone, to night. Do not. If you are a man, you will not.” I was terrified with the horrour that his face expressed. I knew not what to say. I could not comprehend his purpose. But I said, as coolly, as I could. “No, Molton—I will not leave you—I—” He sprang from his chair;—he seized my hands;—he almost embraced me;—nay, I could swear that there were tears in his eyes. But he shook in every joint. “Very well—I have your promise—I—.” The most astonishing fixedness followed, as he said this;—his lips moved—but his voice died away, in a hollow, inarticulate whisper;—and his eyes were fixed upon the terrace that passed the window,—with an intentness that made my blood run cold. Why was I affected in this manner? I saw nothing— heard nothing; but the atmosphere grew chilly, all at once, about me,—and my chair rattled against the table. He breathed aloud. The blood rushed over his face again:—he wiped off the clammy sweat, that adhered to his brow; arose, and walked to the terrace,---opened the door, and was gone for a few moments. When he came back, he was entirely composed; a faint smile, but a bitter one, was upon his lips, and his blue eyes were unnaturally glazed. “Let us continue our discussion,” said he. “We shall not be interrupted again, to night.” He looked at the watch ---“No, the hour has passed—that was the third time.” “Interrupted!” said I, inaudibly---“how? Interrupted!” “Hush—hush! This is no proper place, for such questions. You are young. Beware, lest you bring it back;— would you have your lips dry—your throat scorched—your heart turned to cinders—your—.” I obeyed—less, I am sure, with any apprehension of spiritual things,—than out of respect to the tremendous agitation that I saw in him. Cousin,—if ever there was a man on this earth, supremely wretched, that man is Edward Molton. No matter whence it arises—I care not—I ask not—it is our duty to pity him, and pray for him. He resumed, as follows—with a tone and manner, of such perfect unconcern, that one would have thought that nothing had happened, or that he had no interest, whatever, in the matter. “The third charge, is, if possible, more serious. Ye it is true—I do not deny it. I did attempt to win a woman away from her solemn engagement to another,— and I failed. Why? Perhaps I could give a better reason than any that you have heard;—but one that I have ever loved, I cannot speak of irreverently. Her own heart must judge her. But the facts are these. I saw her by accident, when she was a school girl. I thought little of her, at first, until a circumstance made me believe that she had a better mind, than I had ever suspected.— I saw her in tears,—shaken with ungovernable emotion and shame. I soothed her—and her manner, afterward, was that of deep interest, not of tenderness, so much as of awe. She was afraid of me. Sir—I am not a man to be deceived in such things. I have had too much experience. I have done with falsehood,—for I am not long for the only place where falsehood is permitted—this vile earth. The devils are true to each other. You may believe me, then;—and I declare to you, solemnly, that this girl loved me;—loved me, as passionately and as truly, as any child of her age (for she was only 15 or 16) ever loved a man of mine. I knew this,—felt this,— and there was two other persons, at least, who saw enough, in her manner, even in their presence, to justify them in saying, as I do, that she loved me. Yet I took no advantage of this. We were often alone, and once, in particular, when we had little hope of ever meeting again. Yet I forbore to signify any other than the solicitude of a brother, for the true welfare of a young, and beautiful, and innocent sister. She expected more—but she was impressed, I am sure, with more reverence for me. Why did I forbear? I loved her—indeed I did—not so much for what she was, as for what I believed that she would be; and I cautioned her, with all the feeling of a lover, but with the manner of a friend, against many things of vital importance to her,—her sudden and enthusiastick prepossessions—and prejudices;—the consequence of flattery, for she was much sought after, and, I have no doubt, truly beloved, by several young men of good talent, and respectable family, at the time. But why did I forbear? From principle. I believed that she loved me. Grant that I was deceived; grant that my vanity, which was inordinate in some matters, though I believe not in these, had deceived me. Yet I loved her;—in that, I could not be deceived,—but I forebore to communicate, by the slightest touch, or tone, or look, one thought of what I felt. Was there no forbearance in that? I treated her as something hallowed,—I used no caressing manner:—no squeezing of hands;—no embracing;—no touching of lips or forehead. No!—never did I attempt either. Why? She was a child. I was afraid of familiarising her to such things; afraid of corrupting even the atmosphere of her thought—afraid of breathing upon her innocence;---afraid of “dashing the tremulous dew from the flower”---of brushing the “soft blue from the grape.” I was poor. I saw no likelihood of being otherwise, for many a weary year. I was but just entering a profession, perilous, and uncertain. Many years were to be spent in my novitiate, for I had no education. I was taken from school at twelve,—my mother was a widow woman,—poor, and kept a school for a living. And many years more must pass, before I ought to think of loving. What then? Was there nothing noble? Nothing of self denial? Nothing heroick, in this sacrifice? I leave you to answer it. Did I not know that the heart once touched—like the lips, with a live coal,—is forever callous to all but the like touches, again;—that the uninhabited heart, will have a substantial tenant, evil or good—rather than be haunted by the shadow of a departed loved-one? Yet I left her— left her, in silence—in ignorance of my feeling.” “Well---I returned to my home—entered upon my studies—toiled day and night, as no other man ever toiled, in America. What was my reward? I heard that she was to be married.—Did I repine? No. I heard that the affianced man was worthy of her; that she loved him —and I was happy. Nay—I had no wish to disturb her—or him.” Q “It happened, however, that one who knew them both, gave me good reason to believe that I was remembered yet;—that he, the lover, was uneasy, when my name was mentioned; and, from another quarter, from a man of honest and substantial principle, who knew her well---I heard this, perhaps incautiously. “I do not believe that she loves Mr. G.”—(the name of her lover)—Nay, the same man advised me to see her. Perhaps it was only a piece of pleasantry in him—but I thought that there was some significance in his manner. But I refused. Why? I trembled to disquiet a young heart, in its pleasant dreaming;—for, if it awoke, what had I to offer it?—Nothing?—I was poor and proud—destitute—and with a prospect of being so, forever.” “But, nevertheless, we met—met, just where I had seen her before. Twice were we visiters of the same place— at the same time—leagues and leagues from our home. I treated her as a married woman. I spoke of her lover, as her husband, for some days. At last, however, something, I know not what, set me upon the suspicion that she did not love him, as she could love—nay, as she had loved, even in her childhood. I trembled for her. Did she love me still? It were too much to imagine that. But that she felt a deep and sincere respect for me, I was sure. I was afraid to trust myself with her. Two or three weeks had passed, during which, the letters of her lover (who was at a great distance, and in the habit of writing every week,) did not arrive. I studied her countenance. There was some concern in her eyes—but it was not that inward, that profound, quiet agony, which true love would feel; the love that I would inspire. Other circumstances occurred to strengthen the suspicion, one, only, of which I shall name. I was walking to church with her. I spoke of the power that a woman has, to win whom she pleases. I said, emphatically, that it was in her power. She replied, in a manner that, had we been alone, it is probable I should have profited by—that if it were true, she knew whom she would win.” She did not mean her lover, by that, I am sure;—sure, from her voice;—sure, because she was not a fool;—and there was a mysterious meaning in her manner, that would have been ridiculous, had she meant Mr. G. for what need of mystery with him—every body knew that she was engaged to him—No—she meant me.” “But I took no notice of it, either then or afterward. The time was now at hand, for my departure. It had been unaccountably delayed; and I was really anxious to be gone. My nights were troubled and sleepless. I retired early, but it was not to sleep. If, said I, she do not love him; or, if she do love me—what a fool I am, not to speak; should I ever forgive myself, were she to marry him, and be wretched? but would it not be dishonourable to break such an engagement as theirs asunder? No—it was doing as I would be done by. That was my rule of action.” “The next day was a sort of religious festival; and I had determined to stay no longer than, till that was over. In the morning, therefore, after breakfast, contrary to my usual custom, which was, to read to the women, a great part of the forenoon; or, at least, to sit with them, I retired to another apartment, and began writing.—There is the letter, sir. Read it at your leisure. It expresses all that I felt. It occupied me, in writing and copying it, nearly all the forenoon; and when I came down, I learnt, to my astonishment, that Emma, (let that be her name; it is sufficient for our purpose;) had gone to bed, sick. I was alarmed; but my vanity, which, like that of all others, I suppose, will find aliment, in unsubstantial things—colour and fragrance in the very air—made me suspect the cause. I determined to try the question fairly. I came down, and sat below;—and she soon made her appearance; full of dignity, expression, and loveliness.” “The letter was in my pocket. But how was I to give it to her?—when?—I determined to keep it, till I was ready to go; and leave it, beyond the reach of accident, in her possession;—for, you will perceive that I took no advantage of her situation. Had I been the scoundrel that some affected to think me, would I not have assailed her, in the heat of her resentment against the supposed neglect of Mr. G? Would I not have demanded, at least, an immediate answer? Would I have put myself, as I did, into her power, without demanding that she should put herself at all in mine? Would I have left it in her power to take me, when she pleased, as a sort of Hobson's choice. These are rational questions.—Let the rational answer them. No—that woman may not know it, but I paid her a greater compliment, than she will ever receive again, should she live a thousand years. She may—but no, I do not believe it—I was about saying, that she may think me base and unprincipled. But no—she knows me better. Her own heart will aquit me. I am willing to submit to that. And however she may find it expedient to revile me, or my memory, I shall forgive her, and attribute it to necessity. She dare not do me justice. But her heart will awake—it will, am sure, one day or other; and she will feel sorry, and ashamed of having written me such a note, as you will find in the letter that I gave you.” “But let me proceed. In the evening, as we sat together, in a mournful and distressing, yet sweet silence. After all the company had gone—no, I am mistaken.—It was before—it was early in the evening; we had not yet come to the moment, when, about to part, perhaps forever, the approaching separation took its most touching and mysterious movement and expression. I wrote upon a little card, something like this—and gave it to her. “I have somewhat to communicate to you.—Where shall I leave it?—It is written.—Shall I put it in your little green work bag, in the sitting room?—” She assented, with considerable emotion. I placed that letter in the bag.— She secured it, and returned.—I sat by her, until I was sure that she could not read it, before I was gone;—and then, I bade them all farewell; and departed the next morning, at day-light.” “One year afterward, having good reason to believe that she really would be married to Mr. G.—and being, I confess, rather anxious to set myself free, from so unequal an engagement, I wrote to her, and demanded, rather cavalierly, I am sure, a definite reply; and a return of my letters.—Nay—to tell you the whole truth, I had already began to think of another woman. But, would I have married her, had she claimed my promise?—Yes— By my hope of heaven! Yes! though I had been miserable forever, in consequence—and she—and she should never have suspected, to my dying day, that she had not always been the dearest idol of my heart. You will find her answer in the same letter.” (both of which, I enclose to you, Sarah; and shall direct to Boston.) “She never wrote that answer, without advice. Nor is it true.— Her lover, or some friend, was probably at her elbow; and it is rather her own vindication, than any thing else. I do not believe that she destroyed the letters immediately; nor ever, without first taking a copy;—and I know, that she entertained far different sentiments of my conduct, while left to herself; for her own aunt says, in a letter, which is in my cabinet at this moment, and was written some days after Emma had received “the papers,” at which she affects to have been so “incensed,” that Emma speaks of me with veneration—no, that she “reverences” me—.” That is all. Good night, Sarah— JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By heaven!—I have discovered the cause of Molton's horrour. Last night was the night of William's murder, just two years ago;—no wonder that he was afraid to be alone—. O, Molton—!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO EMMA RANDALL L—, 2d Dec. 181-. Read this alone, and where it is not possible for you to be interrupted. I hardly know how to address you, and yet I feel an insupportable anxiety to be thoroughly understood, before I leave you, perhaps, forever. You will be surprised, I know you will, at my writing you;— but how else could I communicate with you? You are Q 2 too narrowly watched---by your friends, I admit, those who are, and ought to be most dear to you, but still, you are too narrowly watched, to afford any person, and particularly me, an opportunity of unreserved and uninterrupted conversation with you, upon any interesting subject. I had determined, when I came here, to observe you closely---narrowly, but secretly;—to make myself master of your character; and, if possible, of your most hidden thought. In some measure, I have succeeded, and yet---on the very point, where I feel the deepest interest, I am still in doubt. You only can satisfy me---to you then, I appeal. I did intend, too, to be watchful of myself; never to be thrown off my guard; to be discreet and reserved. But I could not---I cannot be such a hypocrite. You have prevailed; I am about to leave you, and I cannot, will not lose you, forever, without making one effort to preserve you---without first proving to you that I know your value. You think that I overrate it. You are mistaken. I do not. I know you as you are---as you were, and as you will be. I cannot be deceived. For more than two years, your character has been my study---my companion ---my support and impulse.[4] [4] A lie—by the way—M. This is the truth. I am frank---perhaps too frank;---but you must not be offended. It would be unworthy of you. I should deserve to be despised, derided, trampled on, were I the dastard to conceal such a passion as this, where I have so much at stake; and you will not, from affectation, the miserable prudery of your sex, feel offended at the declaration of one, who, whatever may be his faults, has manhood enough to speak as he feels. Another thing, I had determined on, not resolutely, but in some measure. It was to treat you as the wife of another. It was in vain. You are not the wife of another, and I cannot so treat you, until you are so indeed, and beyond, forever beyond, my reach. I did determine too,—and I mention these things, that you may understand how feeble, how very feeble our best resolutions are, where passion is not prevented from laying her hand upon them—I did determine never to say “I love,” to any being on earth, until I was certain that she would reply---“I love.” That too, is done with.--- I shall break my promise, and when I do, I know that I shall have risked enduring the keenest, the most deadly humiliation, that such a spirit as mine can ever endure. You, my dear friend (you must permit me to call you so)---regarding yourself as already engaged, are struggling to believe that the man, to whom you are engaged, is your husband. Emma, I tremble for you. He is not---and possibly never may be. And what is the engagement?--- is it marriage?---no. It is an understanding, that, if your affections are unchanged;---if both continue to find none whom they love better;---if both continue to feel, as during the first impulse of youthful affection, then---both shall be married together. And that is all. Therefore, if you love Mr. G. and he be, indeed, the man who deserves you;---if he be the creature, not of romance, or poetry, but of that towering elevation in real life, which must be the characteristick of your companion;---if he be so made, so fashioned, as to receive and communicate impulses, that shall outlast this life;---in short, if he be the man, who is to be your husband, and who deserves to be, then must he glory in exposing you to competition. If he tremble---he is unworthy of you. If he complain, though his heart break under the disappointment, he is not the man to whom you must look for counsel, comfort and greatness. For, is it not better to lose the woman of your heart, than to have her marry you, with abated affection, merely from a sense of duty, or propriety? Yes ---he who wins you, must be willing to prove his confidence in you and himself, by arraying himself against the whole world, if it will enter the list for you. Emma!---this is not declamation. It is what I feel. I could do all this;---nay, I would do it. I am doing, therefore, as I would be done by; and if Mr. G. be the man that I delight in believing him (for I would have no humble com petitor,) he will be gratified, and proud, whatever be the result. Now then, I give you a proof of it. I throw myself on your generosity.—I forget all my pride—I declare to you that I love you—that I have long loved you;—that I have never so loved any other woman—never felt for another, so much of what I would pray to feel, for the future companion of my life, here and hereafter—tenderness, admiration and respect. You are already what I would have you be, so far as your character is developed; and you will be, all that I would hope to deserve. I am sure of it. For myself, I am, whatever I am, chiefly on your account.[5] [5] Another lie.—M. I would be worthy of you. There is my proof. I address you as my equal. Do not believe that I am about asking any sacrifice, on your part, at this time. Indeed, I am not. It is all on mine. All that I ask is this. If you believe that I may become worthy of what I aspire to, think of me, and direct me. What I can be, I will be for your sake. Mould me to your purpose. I know what I say. I do not fear to say, that I will become what you would wish me to be; because, I know that you would never humble me in my own eyes; that you would never request, what it would be unworthy in me to grant, or you to receive. Again, I say—Do not believe that I am aiming to entangle you in contradictory engagements. No—I would sooner perish. Nor, would I, were I sure that you loved another, were I convinced that you so loved him, as with all your boundless capacity of devotion, you are qualified to love, would I open my mouth to you on the subject.—Indeed, the hour that so convinced me, would be the last of our communion. I would leave you forever; I would never meet you again, never! As it is, then, I have my doubts. They are not the doubts of others; they are my own, firm observation of my own. I care not what Mr. Stonebridge says, or others. They cannot understand you, or me. You are not made for an ostentatious display of affection.— Yours is silent, holy, unobtrusive and mysterious. Therefore, have I my doubts, and they are terrible.—Your happiness—I care little for my own, in comparison, your happiness, here and hereafter, is at stake. Now, all that I ask of you, is this. Remember me. Think of me, sometimes. Betray this communication to no human being, till you are married. I know that I may trust you; and you know the value of the trust. You have that generosity, that made me love you, not at first sight, (for I was not a boy, when I saw you) but when I first made myself master of your character. This then, is all that I ask. Betray this to nobody—to no living creature, without my consent. But, when you are married— whether to Mr. G. or another, for I feel that though he may not win you, it is equally possible, and more so perhaps, that I may not—you may show him (your husband) this letter. If I am alive, at that time, it will be the surest marriage portion that woman ever gave to man. Nothing ever after will shake his confidence in your love—if he have a noble spirit. Do not charge me with vanity here. I am vain. I know it, and am sometimes weak enough to glory in it. It is a diseased ambition, I verily believe; and I hope to outlast it. Still, in this case, I do honestly and from my soul, believe, that I shall be a man, whom your husband, whatever he may be, will be proud to have had sacrificed to him. In the mean time, I shall hold on my course steadily. You will hear of me, but not from me, unless you should indeed, be all that I could wish;—and—but no, I must not dream of such things. Yet let me be understood.— Your present engagement may come to an end. Men and women are changeable; our affections run riot sometimes, and will not be restrained. If then—I say it with trembling—if such an event should take place; if, by any event, you should discover that you cannot so love your present contemplated husband as you ought, to be able to trust all your happiness to him—all that I beg of you is, to let me hear of it. I shall understand you. You need fear no change in me. My constancy is not that of boys. It is that of experience and examination. When I love, it is not, though my character would justify a different opinion sometimes, it is not precipitately, without examination. Here is an example. I have never loved but two women. To only one, have I ever said so much.— The other, and you know her, thought that she did not love me. She was mistaken.—She is now going married, and broken-hearted, to her grave. I did love that woman; I did, and confess it; but not, as I have loved you. There was tenderness in it; but, very little respect. I never saw the time, when I would have married her, even if I had been justified by my circumstances. But, were I so justified, I would marry you; I would come to you then, not in the language of common love, to throw myself at your feet, for you would dispise me, were I so abject—but to meet you as a man should meet a woman, with his heart in his hand—in fearless equality, remembering that I was paying to you the most unequivocal homage, that I could pay to any creature under heaven;— and, though grateful, to suffocation if you received me, still erect and confident of my equality. Such would be my conduct, were it allowed to me, so to behave.— Adieu!—farewell!—I am already tedious, I fear, and yet I have said but little that I would say. Farewell! may heaven bless you, Emma. May you find your equal—a companion made to govern, not obey others. EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One word more. You will hear of my fickleness—that I am in love with others. Do not believe it. I am not. I have been. I have compared you with many women, in all parts of our country; and I am, nevertheless, more resolutely attached than ever. For my disposition—it is fiery, I know. But it is capable of becoming whatever you please to make it. I am rash, to be sure: but, when the happiness of others, of them that I love, is at stake, I can endure anything. As for what I am, you already know me. But I ask not your answer to what I am now; but to what I shall be. Hereafter, you may compare me with whom you please. If I cannot abide the trial, cast me off, abandon me, leave me. I shall be unworthy of you. If you go to Boston, you will hear much against me—and much in my favour. Believe neither. Judge for yourself. I know my own character, and what I am capable of. No other human being does. When you desire it, you shall know it, as it is—enthusiastick—impassioned—devoted and ambitious—doing whatever it does—with all its heart, and all its soul. Some interest, it is possible, you may feel, respecting my family. Much you must feel, at some future period, if I should ever meet you as I hope to. In the mean time you may believe me, when I say that it is, altogether, unexceptionable. All are respectable and honest. And some are higher in the estimation of the world than mere honesty would place them.[6] [6] Another lie, meant, but not expressed—M. They are not fashionable people, but they are good. As for my attention to other girls, and “falling in love with every girl I see,” that is altogether unfounded. I trifle with, or treat with respect, as they happen to deserve, coquettes or fine women, when I see them (and you do the same, with men)—but as for love—never! That is a passion of no common seriousness with me. It is inappeasable. I never felt it—as an enduring passion, but for you. Remember me. I shall never forget you—and—be not precipitate. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Answer—received nearly a year afterward—alluded to in the conversation of Molton.) MR. MOLTON, I was this morning much surprised by the reception of another epistle from you; and extremely disappointed and chagrined at your interpretation of my silence, with regard to the paper (that) I found in my possession, after your departure from Leister. On the perusal of those letters, I was greatly shocked and incensed;† † A fib—ladies never lie—M. —still they would have been answered—could I have hoped it would be believed;—but how could I hope for any such respect, from a man, who believed me capable of engaging myself, to a man (that) I did not love—who could presume (that) I might be influenced in a matrimonial contract, by any other consideration than that of love; and this, your letter most unequivocally expressed you to presume and believe. No person, entertaining even a tolerable respect for me, could have supposed (that) I would engage to repose myself and all my future prospects, upon the bosom of a man, to whom I had not extended all the “boundless devotion of my soul.” No; every new reflection that I bestow upon the subject, confirms me in the persuasion, that I never could have received your papers, from a person of honourable and virtuous feeling; or who could have formed a just estimate of my character. Could you know me, and suppose (that) I would preserve long, the letters alluded to? I assure you (that) the impulse to commit them to the flames, was simultaneous with their perusal. I regret now that I obeyed it, since you request the return of them.[7] [7] Well managed. There is no convicting one of falsehood—who talks in this way. It is lawyer-like—but may she not have had professional advice? The mortal antipathy that appears to the relative (that) would justify the belief that she had—and that her counsel was a lawyer—an American—and a Yankee.—M. I can assure you (that) I regret as sincerely as you can, the moment that induced you to write them, for it compelled me to consider you in a different light from what I had always hoped to —that of a friend. EMMA B. RANDALL. N—, Oct. 23, 18—. (Postscript, by John, to Sarah, in the envelope.) P. S.—Mistaken girl! Where was the mischief of that letter? I pity her, Sarah. Tell me, does it not speak well for Molton? And can you believe that her answer came from her heart—unaided, untortured? No! She was wrought upon—suspicion was infused into her pure nature—she was made to believe that Molton had insulted her—or she never would have charged the writer of that letter with aught that was not “virtuous and honourable.” What did he do? Admit that he was deceived in supposing that she did not love G.—or that she did love him. What did he do? Nothing but this, in effect. He said to her—Your happiness is dearer to me than my own. You are about to be sacrificed. I may be mistaken. I hope that I am. But if I am right, call to me when you will, where you will; and lo, I am ready to save you, at the peril of my life and soul. And this—this she has dared to call dishonourable and unfriendly. Mistaken woman!—her own heart rebuked her, when she wrote it. Nay, it was never written of her own free will. Her judgment was turned aside by the powerful hand of some one, who never had seen, or never had known, the author of that letter. Her manner is more simple and direct. What advantage did he take of her? None. Did he even attempt to steal into her heart? No. Did he offer any endearment? No. Did he break in upon another's love? No!—another broke in upon his. What did he, then? He attempted to restore a woman to him, whom he believed, to have been her first love! Was this sinful? It matters not, whether he was mistaken or not. If he was mistaken, there was no harm done. He did not hurry her. He took no profit of her anger, or of his opportunity; extorted no promise;—nay, avoided even a reply, that she might have nothing to accuse herself of, if she married G.—and yet, that she might have a steadfast hold on him. By heaven, it was the noblest, the most disinterested, and heroick evidence of love, unquestionable love, that I ever met with!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think, as Molton does, that she will come to her senses—that she will repent of having written that letter. Nay, if she have any heart left, she will weep, to think, how unkindly she requited the greatest offering of a proud spirit—itself. I observe some pencil notes, in the handwriting of Molton; but I have no time to read them. What a packet I have made of it! and yet, I am strongly tempted to add another that I received, this morning, R from my dear brother. He is going to New-Orleans— writes in good spirits. But there is something in it, which I cannot put in your way. I am rather alarmed, too, about him; and shall go on, I think, to Charleston. Adieu. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Molton has just sent me a letter. I enclose a copy. Read it. What does he mean? If my brother have any blood left, he will return, and bring him to an account. Yes, I shall go to Charleston this very day, and leave direction, with Jane, to forward any letters that are left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO JOHN. Charleston, May 10th, 18—. My dear Brother, I am ruined. Send me a thousand dollars. I have no time to relate the particulars; but, if you would save me from dishonour, send me the money. I shall wait only one post over the time. I am in good spirits—very good —can laugh, and talk, and play, and drink, and—yes, yes! I am in very good spirits. We talk of going to New-Orleans. A passage thence to South America, or the peninsula, I don't know which, will be the next step. Is—brother, dear brother, for God's sake, write to me, immediately. Tell me, how is—no matter for the name. Tell me. Let nothing prevent you. I like this city. My letters have been of service to me, and I am, continually, at some entertainment or other, given in princely style, by some of the reigning nabobs. But this—O, curse this affectation. Brother, I cannot trifle. That day has gone by. I am too heavy here; too hot about the temples, for laughter. What is festivity to me?—the carousal of a charnel house?—the feast of the sick chamber? Dear, dear Ju—ah, no!—the pale, lovely shadow went by me, last night, in my dreams;— and, I am sure, that, that—no, no! I cannot speak it. If it be all over, seal your letter with black. No matter for the money, then—that will be sufficient. Go where I will, I hear something of Molton. A gentleman boards here, who knew him in Philadelphia. He says that Molton courted a girl for several years, there; then persuaded a friend to take her off his hands;—that the friend discovered something, just at the critical moment of marriage;—that the affair was broken off;—the girl fell sick, and Molton, himself, went into the country with her, and his friend left the city:—that Molton renewed his addresses;—introduced another man to her;—affected to quarrel with her;—was turned out of the house by her father;—that she married the man that Molton introduced and died in childbed a few months afterward. John, is this true? Can it be? Enquire into it. I give you the names. Love to Sarah. Her name was Marion, M. P.—I find that I have known her. Her story made many a heart ache. FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO FRANK OMAR. I owe you no courtesy, young man. But, you have dared to love Juliet Gracie; and you cannot be entirely worthless. Are you a man? Awake, then.— Were you presumptuous enough to think of her, and yet, so feeble of spirit, as to throw away your life and faculties, like a foolish boy, at your first disappointment?— You do not respect me. It is your own fault. Come to me, and I will make you respect me. You cannot support adversity. How then, could you calamity; humiliation; poverty, and death—with a helpless woman—a family, perhaps, dependant upon you?— For shame, Omar.—I know your brother. He is younger than you; but, on some accounts, I would rather trust the happiness of Juliet to his keeping, than to yours. Do not be startled;—do not threaten me;—do not distrust me. It would be idle. There is not time to lose. Come back—come back. Juliet is at my disposal. Do as I bid you, and she may be yours. A plot is working for her destruction. Come quickly, or you will be too late. You are poor. No matter—I have enough, and to spare. Are you jealous of me? Come to me, and I will satisfy you, that you have no cause—that I cannot, will not see her again, while there is life in me. Do you tremble for the past? Then, you are unworthy of her. If her face be not a guarantee that you cannot doubt, you are too base of spirit, too base indeed, for her happiness. I make no professions. I say nothing of the past. Once, I loved her. I love her yet;—but we can never be married. And it will be your fault, if she ever know that I love her. Her happiness is dear to me. I have made some inquiry about you; and I believe that you are better fitted for her, than any other, whom I know. Dare you come? nothing else can save her—. The conspirators are at the work of death. ED: MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I fear that you are a gambler. If you are—Sir—beware. Do not approach me. I would rather encounter a murderer. I would rather put an angel into the arms of one, reeking with the blood of his own father. What is he, but the murderer of soul and body—wife and children—father and mother—people and kindred?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MOLTON TO ASHTON. Rev. Mr. C. Ashton—London. For the work which you have sent me, sir, please to accept my sincere thanks. I have not yet been able to study it, as I could wish;—but I have read it, with some diligence; and, when I have a little more leisure, which I hope to have, after a few weeks, I shall make it a point, to go over the whole again, carefully and deliberately. I did not flatter myself that I was remembered by the author; or even by yourself; for, though my acquaintance with you, was short and accidental, that which I had with him, was still more so. But it would be in vain to deny, that I feel myself flattered, by your remembrance, and notice. Perhaps, indeed, my pleasure is not a little enhanced, by the recollection of what would otherwise, have been a subject of pain; the extremely short and unfrequent opportunities that we had, of becoming acquainted. They left me no right to hope for your remembrance; and therefore, I believe, that it is the more flattering. You were one of the very few men, whom I saw abroad, that seemed to entertain an enlarged, and understanding sense of the American character. You, I have heard defend it, in a manner that brought tears into my eyes. I was an American. You did not know it. I was young; unknown; and, whether from constitutional coldness, and reserve in me, hindering or rebuking all advances; a deportment too dark and unbending; or a countenance too haughty and repulsive, to each of which, I have heard the consequence attributed;—I had no friend; none, certainly, among men of my own age. There were a few, a very few of the wise and experienced, who, at times, condescended to make use of me;—nay, there were two or three, and God will reward them for it, older, and better, and greater, than the mass of mankind, who loved and respected me;—made me their companion and their friend. Mr. Ashton, I have a proud heart. I would sooner die, than be the cause of humiliation, to one human being, that truly loved me. And, therefore, though they were my friends, the world knew it not. There were but few, whom I ever permitted to see us together. I never spoke of them. I never boasted of their affection or reverence;—no, for it would have been discreditable to them. The world had its prejudices. For myself, I scorned them. I knew that the time must come, when those prejudices would be forgotten. But I was unwilling to associate another, with me, in the mortal R 2 desolation that encompassed me, till then. On this account, when a stranger gave me his hand, it was received with a swelling of the heart; a choking, that none but men who have my feeling, and have been as cruelly misunderstood, can have an idea of. He, I knew, could have no light motive for the movement. He could not be reaching after popularity, or influence. He could not be seeking for an acquaintance, merely; for there was that, I trust, in my face, little encouraging to such men. I could not flatter. I would not. If a man were good, I could think well of him. If he were religious, I could respect him. But he must be more than either; more than both: more than a good and religious man, too;— for me to remember his face till the next day. You did this. You dared to single me out. I knew the risk that you run. The most charitable thought that you were mistaken and infatuated; many wondered at you; and some scrupled not to think you a bad man, because you associated with me. What had I done? nothing—nothing. They were my enemies; and they knew not why. They have since become my friends; and on just as good a foundation. They then thought too humbly of me. Now, they have gone to the other extreme. They think too well of me. I look for a change of tide. I expect it;—it will not ebb quite as far as it did before:—but if it did, it would not move me. I wish that I had met you again, after our last conversation. I intended it, but my sudden departure, which I take it for granted, you have not heard of, or do not so cruelly condemn me for, as others do—or you would not have written to me, prevented me from fulfilling my appointment. It was a painful thing to me, to disappoint you;— it always is, to me, to break an engagement;—but I felt an uncommon solicitude for your good opinion. Old as you were, Mr. Ashton, surrounded as you were by men, mighty in the ways of philosophy, I should have embraced you on the spot, when you uttered your testimony in behalf of my country, had I not been restrained by respect for you. I was an American;— nameless then—but I should not be long so—I was sure of that—events were then maturing, which, I had reason to believe, would, in their mystery and blackness, soon blast my reputation. Would I involve you in my fate? No. And therefore, it was that I refused your invitations and avoided you, so frequently as I did. I had no other way. I am naturally ingenuous; but, had I avowed the simple truth, you would have pursued me, in spite of my wishes, and partaken, assuredly in my dishonour. Thank God, however, that you have not forgotten me. Thank God!—and I do thank him, my dear sir, in the sincerity of my whole heart and soul, that you have had the courage to remember me, and appeal to me, for the truth of that story. You shall know the truth. There is only one other man on earth that knows it. And I inform you, sir, as I would my father. Make what use of it you please. But observe—I do not tell you the whole truth; I am only at liberty to tell that which concerns myself. Helen—whose family you must know something of, and I, once met, under circumstances of a very trying nature. She loved me. She was lovely—intelligent— and, as I thought, her own mistress. We met frequently. She did runaway from her guardian;—and she did conceal herself for several days;—but, contrary to the general belief, I do declare to you that I never saw her, until about two hours before I restored her to her home. Yes—it was I, that restored her. I was amazed at her rashness; and, it was not till I heard the whole story of her suffering that I could persuade myself to believe, that one so young and beautiful, so passionately beautiful, could have so forgotten her station, for an adventurer;—for what was I, but an adventurer? True, I was not base enough, nor wicked enough, to seek her destruction; but, when she was within my power;—nay, I will not boast of it—others would have done the same—I spared her. I represented to her the consequences of her act—to her friends—her family—herself. She trembled and wept. She even told me how long she had been absent and where. I was thunderstruck. I feared that it would be a death blow to her fame—and I said so. Her reply was a delirious laugh;—and the next moment, I was alarmed by a noise at the door. “I am pursued,” said she—“it is he! It is he! I took down my sword. I planted myself at the door. I would have slain the first man that entered, at such a moment, had it been mine own father. We were mistaken. It was not the scoundrel, at whose name, the poor creature shivered like a maniac, before her keeper. But it was one that had pursued her to my room. She smiled bitterly, when she knew the truth,— very bitterly; and I do believe, rejoiced at the consummation of their guilt, not of hers. We immediately departed—I took a carriage; and, on the route, brought her to some sense of her desperate rashness. I was poor—miserably poor—helpless, and beset. What should I do with a wife? She interrupted me, by producing a quantity of jewels, that, with my little acquaintance in such matters, appeared of great price. My amazement increased. What was I to think of her? Was her brain turned? Was she a spoiled girl, sick with novel reading? She was very young, only 17; had just been presented;—was exceedingly sought after, even in her retirement, out of which she had emerged, at the instance of some quality lady, who was a distant relation. We had met but now and then;—and my deportment had been, merely that of earnestness and frankness. On other themes, too, she exhibited a sober and well disciplined mind. What was I to think? It could not be love for me. I demanded the truth. She told me.— Gracious God,—my very blood leaped in my veins. She showed me the evidences of a barbarity so horrible, that I could have gone out against an army to avenge it. All these things were to compel her to marry, either her guardian, or his son; for I have reason to believe that they had embezzled the chief part of her estate; and were willing to avoid their accountability in that way. But enough. She consented, at last, to return. But only on this conditions; for the performance of which. I pledged myself—promising, if it were violated, to assist her, in any way that she pleased against them. The condition was that they should forbear; and leave her entirely to herself. I wrote a letter—which was returned to me unopened. I am not a man to forget such things. But I can forgive them. I did forgive this. But I had soon reason to repent of my forbearance. I was publiclky insulted. I bore it— why?—because appearances were against me. I was called a seducer,—by whom?—by Clinton Howard, the brother of Helen.—He would never have left my presence, had I not discovered that fact. I had already prepared myself. Another word—and—but no. I could have done it. After this I met with you. I loved you at first sight. By this, I mean, not that I thought of you then, as I do now, or, as I hope to, hereafter—but, merely, that I felt drawn to you, with affection and respect. The very next day, after we last met, I was passing the square near where my chambers were—when I heard some one calling out my name, behind me.—I turned— A hackney coach was approaching at great speed;—as it came near, the blinds were let down and I saw Helen. Her hair was dishevelled—and I suspected some violence. I was mistaken. The coachman drew up, and I entered. She was alone, splehdidly, beautiful, attired—with her dress stained here and there—and stiffened with what I discovered to be blood—her own blood! My horrour and rage were ungovernable. She had just escaped from the ruffians;—and I, with the little money that I then had about me, abandoned my lodgings.—I have never set my foot within them, since.—I was indifferent about pursuit; but she, poor Helen, she was distracted, and overcome, by her distress and fear. With a feeling of respect for her desolation, I went immediately, took a license, an irregular one, I admit, but I did not then know it—and, (it was all that I could get without going to Scotland;) and, in an hour from the time when I first met her, I had a title, the truest and holiest title, that the protector of woman can have.—I was her husband. Yet, I cannot deny that there are times when we are both of us troubled in a manner, that I should deem unaccountable, were it not for the nature of our marriage. I cannot help feeling, that, while there is any doubt about the legality of it, our endearment is, I know not hardly how to express myself, is not, what I would have it, altogether incapable of misrepresentation;—and to her, it is infinitely more trying. But, in my own justification, however, I ought to apprise you, that I did not know of any informality in the marriage, until about eight months ago. I was deceived. Helen was under a strange mistake. After our first adventure, she had employed counsel—why, I never troubled myself to ask, who told her that, a license taken out in a dissenting Chapel, without a publication of the banns, would be complete authority. Alas, for our errour—we were both cheated by it;—and, remain now, only man and wife in the eyes of God—not even in our own eyes—assuredly not in hers, with a feeling of absolute guiltiness now and then, to disquiet us, till we have an opportunity of re-marrying. I care little for ceremony—but I care much for the legitimacy of my children. And she, poor heart, would be crazed, but for our temporary separation which we immediately agreed to, when I discovered the irregularity:—The change of her name—and the artifice (which I was brought to adopt—I hardly know how) of passing her off for my sister.—But I will not endure it much longer. The heat of the pursuit is nearly over, now;—and I hope soon to obtain her consent to another marriage, by her true name, in publick. She is very averse to it, now—but that I attribute to her recent alarm. But the catastrophe. After our marriage, we departed. We were pursued. I found that Helen had large sums of money in her possession. They were bank notes, and as it was my intention to leave all my affairs and embark for the continent of America, I spared no expense, therefore, after exchanging the notes.—We arrived at the coast, and there, were intercepted. The scoundrel who had abused her, was at our heels. He dared to claim, my wife. Nay, he put his ruffian hand upon her, in wrath.—What did I?—I drove my dirk up to the hilt, in his side. I left him, weltering in his blood. And now, we are in America. EDWARD MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK OMAR TO EDWARD MOLTON. Who are you, sir? Whence are you, that you dare to address a letter to me?—and such a letter! Mr. Edward Molton, I know you. You are a scoundrel. I shall sail to-day. But, were not my baggage on board, at this moment, I would measure blades with you, before I slept. Be not too secure. I know more of you, than you suspect. Where did you first encounter William? Are you sure that he had fair play?—sure? I have done with you. But, mark me! We shall meet again. And then—I do not threaten you—but your insulting proposition will not be forgotten. What! would you have me believe, that you could dispose of her, too. Accursed scoundrel—the thought is madness. I prefer thinking you a liar—than classing her with Marion, M. P.—What! does that name startle you? Molton! Molton! if the hand of the Almighty spare you, till my return, I will do my best to offer you up in sacrifice to the broken heart of that mother; and the untimely, blasted fruit of your villany. No—I will not obey you! The story of your power is a lie—or she—the blessed martyr—she is another Marion. F. OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Answer to the foregoing, enclosed in one from Jane to John. Fool—The consequences be upon your own head. E. MOLTON. To Francis Omar, Charleston, S. C. To be forwarded wherever he may be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JANE TO JOHN—ENCLOSING THE ABOVE. O, Mr. Omar, tell your brother to beware. I know not what he has done—what said—but I saw Molton's eyes, when he gave our servant the letter;—and I know him. If your brother be not gone—make him go immediately. Don't let him come here. Don't let Molton meet him there. There is no help for him, if they encounter.— What has he done?—not insulted him?—that he could bear. What has he imagined?—nought of dishonour to him?—for that he would smile at. There is only one thing that I can suppose—and, if it be that—O, God! there is nothing on this earth can save him. Perhaps he has slandered that woman—that Helen!—Is it so? JANE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH RAMSAY TO FRANK OMAR. I know the contents of the letter—no matter how.— Enough for our purpose, that I know them; and foreseeing the consequences, have written as I have. Be not rash, my friend. There is more meaning in Molton's offer than you have been aware of. You have fallen into the pit that he dug for you. You have forever abandoned—what you ought to have clung to, as your life and blood—Juliet. Nay, have you not dishonoured her in your thought? What is the conspiracy that he alludes to? There is meaning in it. Who are the plotters? Be not precipitate. But, as you value me—as you value Juliet—O, avoid Molton. Your reply—I know not what it was—but it has parched his heart up. He has devoted you. Be a hero, for once—O, do! my beloved cousin, and avoid the murderer. What have you to fear? He is a coward. I have said so from the beginning,—have I not? But a coward may assassinate, or poison. Yet, if you do meet—which righteous heaven avert—before you join battle, throw my defiance in his teeth. Woman as I am, I contemn and dare him, to his utmost. Once I did this before Jane. Why? Because I saw her turn pale. I never shall forget her looks. We were not friends, then. “Much as I hate thee, Sarah,” said she to me, “I would not have Molton hear that, for the wide world.— It would be thy destruction. He never was braved with impunity. Nay, woman—thy eyes may flash, and thy lip curl;---but I have seen a mightier than thou—a haughtier one, too—at his feet, in tears, for having said less of him.” I remember her words. I remember her looks. They awed and intimidated me. There was a mystery and a terrour in them. But I forget them, now —I forget every thing. Thy safety only do I consult. I have a secret champion ready for him. I know not who he is;—but there is his gauntlet—(a packet was enclosed)—and I will vouch for him. Give that to Molton, if you ever meet. I am assured of the power;—it is a charm, a spell, a talisman, before which, his arm will fall lifeless. I know not what it is—I do not even imagine. But carry it forever about you;—let nothing tempt you to lay it aside;—for he may fall upon you in the darkness and solitude—he may—(of that I am assured.) In my next to John, I will enclose one of several notes, that I have received, lately, from—I know not whom.— I have never answered them. I knew not who it is, or what; but no guardian angel ever did his ministering more diligently. I have Molton's whole life before me. know every spring of his heart;—and, terrible as he is, I almost pant to encounter him, that I may open the mysterious packet, and confound him, forever, and at once. Am I not strangely altered? I know not what possesses me. What should I have thought, six months ago, had any one said, that I should live to receive anonymous letters—treasure them as I do these—doat on them—and even—my hand trembles, and I blush to the ends of my fingers, at the thought—even begin to meditate a reply. Yes, there are some things that I must ask. I will—if it be only to detect all the villany of Molton. Ha!— would any other theme have so excited me, so impelled me, headlong, as this has? Cousin, I cannot pray. It distresses me. Gradually, have I left off the habit;—yet, O! it had become cold—cold and sad, long before I dared to omit it. There was a time; but ah, that time has passed—when S I could not sleep, if I had omitted my prayers. But now—alas, I cannot sleep, do what I will; and I dare not—cannot pray—. Farewell— SARAH. Boston— P. S.—In my next, I will enclose one of my correspondent's notes—John will tell you more about him;— and I have no objection that you should contrive to let Molton get possession of it. I should like to see him, then.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO MADAM VERNON. Ah, my mother! I must unburden my heart to you.— I cannot, cannot live any longer, without sympathy. Pity me, dear madam, pity me. I am worthy of all your commiseration. Yet why should I repine? Are not these trials, painful and distressing as they are, to be borne with a submissive spirit? O yes, I feel that they are;—but then—no—I cannot tell you more than this —that I am wretched. I do not complain that I am spared a little longer; ah no, but I do think that death would be less terrible to me now, than I have thought it. I do pray for that consolation, which He only can give to a wounded and broken spirit. Can I not come to you? I know your poverty;—it distresses me to hint such a desire, because I know that it will almost kill you to refuse me. But—indeed, you know not how I am beset. There is an amiable man continually about me of late. I know not what to think of him; for his countenance is good, and his deportment mild and winning. But what is he here, for? I cannot but see that there is some motive. I hope that I am not vain; but, really, dear aunt, I do so wish to be released from his attentions: they are too painful to me. The shock that I have had,—the consumption—I mean—it has made me too cruelly sensitive; and shattered my whole constitution. Sometimes too, this man, (Mr. Grenville is his name) sits by me, for whole hours, in that breathless, intense—ah, what am I saying,—no, I will not think of the resemblance. I will arouse myself. O my mother—I can speak to thee;— and, to whom else can I speak? He, whom thou, thyself, didst appoint to me;—even he, is a villain. He thinks that I love him. He is mistaken. He is base. I cannot love him—for how can we love, what we cannot respect? No, no; and yet, at the mention of his name— the sound of approbation, where he is concerned, O, ——I shiver and burn all over. I am poor—helpless—destitute. Is there any succour for me? A heart so sore—so desolate? I know not aunt; but a thought— it was a terrible one—a thought came to me once, in my desperation; and I have not shuddered at its return;— yet, every nerve of my body shook, as with electricity, at first. I know not what I should do—I am very wretched—very. Were it not wicked, I should pray never to arise from that bed—that, to which I am now going. JULIET R. GRACIE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JANE TO MATILDA. Grenville is a blockhead. I have no patience with him. There he sits, moping all night long, by the side of Juliet, without opening his mouth; and only, now and then, catching his breath, as the tune changes. What a pity that so handsome a fellow should be such a fool. We must manage our cards well, or he will never get her; for she is prodigiously improved. Nay, aunt—it gives me the headach, sometimes, to think on what we have prepared for her. She looks so lovely;—so beautiful,— so innocent; and then, her voice! I have heard it compared to a bugle, over the water—but a bugle, a silver bugle, is not so clear and sweet. It is more like a bell ringing in the sky. Ah, my dear aunt, if that stupid fellow would'nt sit by her, so; and look so sad and sorry —just as if he had eaten too heartily of cold apple dumpling—she might be a most enviable woman—spend all her life between tract societies, and prayer meetings, and love feasts—the happiest creature!—ah, who can help gaping?—“To suckle fools and chronicle small beer” —kill spiders, darn rags, and whip children—O, there's nothing so pleasant. Nothing “half so sweet in life”— and then, if she should happen to lose one of her babes— why, it is only giving her new bonnet to quiet her. I have known it succeed, more than once, with bereaved mothers! You see that I am in excellent spirits. You think so, do you? Aunt, I could sit down and cry, with a good stomach—this moment. I don't believe that I shall live long. I have been reading a system of domestick medicine;—don't laugh at me—and, at every page I found myself afflicted with some new disorder. Well, well—come on, come on, directly, as you have promised; make Grenville hold up his head, and look like a man;— and then—aunt,—my dear aunt, I have a fearful secret to communicate to you. Do you not feel cold about the heart! I do—but it is done. No eye to witness it— none. It was tremendously dark. It thundered—and —it was done. And such was the ferocious exaltation of my spirit at the time, that I could have done the same deed, though the day of judgment had been at hand. O, aunt! I feel horribly about the forehead,—very hot and scorching—and my skin peals off, lately, with the fever of my spirit. Indeed—I thought the earth did quake—and—and— yes aunt, I did see, as plainly as I ever saw any thing in this life, the broad paved-aisle, and the altar, that you know I dreamt of;—they opened in the darkness—and I saw smoke issuing from them; I heard musick; and then I saw my mother too, as plainly as I see this hand—sitting there, and looking at the poor little creature.— Yet I did it. Yea—and I should have done it, upon the very altar—though it shook, at the time, with the divinity.—Have you any notion of the truth? No—you have not—you cannot have. What? that the haughty Jane— your pride, your idol—that she should come to—— O, no, it were easier to believe her a murderess.—Aunt, come, come! to me. Some incurable malady is upon me, I know not what it is;—but, if you disappoint me again, I shall die. I am sure of it. Why did you not come before? You might have saved—No, I cannot tell you what.—But come;—in mercy, come. What have I written? I know not; my brain is in a whirl---and I am trying to read it—but I cannot. I begin to pity poor Juliet.--But if I have told anything---you must not believe it---I am in such spirits!---O, aunt, it is the pleasantest thing in the world to feel so full of festivity—no, no, it is a lie—it is not—it is frightful. What is the matter with me? Perhaps you can tell by the writing.—Is it not strangely disordered? JANE. P. S.—That Sarah—I can scarcely speak, for joy— her threatening has come to his ears. Wo to her!— I shall be revenged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ANSWER. Why did I disappoint you?—oh, Jane! Jane!—what have you done! I was sick with horrour and affright.— What have you done!—That terrible letter—. It threw me into convulsions. I am but just alive.—Yet the carriage is already at the door.—I will never, never, leave you again. This will be delivered into your hands, by William. I have ordered him to ride, night and day; and tell you that you shall not be disappointed, again.— No—I will sooner come to you, a corpse.— MATILDA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JOHN. Boston.— I promised to write to you and Juliet again, soon, and enclose one of the anonymous letters. I would write in detail, and inform you how I am pleased with this hospitable, warm hearted people; but, I am yet a stranger; S 2 constantly occupied by visiting; a ceremony, conducted in a fashionable way, that is exceedingly tiresome to me.— When I have more knowledge, and more leisure too, I shall write to our beloved Juliet; and tell her all that I know, or can find out, concerning the good yankees, the sellers of wooden nutmegs;—gloves, all of one hand;— cuckoo-clocks, and Hingham-ware. So far as I have seen them, I like them. The country looks old, rich, and substantial; and the manners, I should think, were remarkably primitive. I speak of the country people.— The buildings, publick and private, are adapted, admirably well; first, for comfort and utility; and then, for show. With us, and further to the south, there seems to be a different tendency. But, perhaps I am prejudiced; for you know, that, where we have been generously treated, it is difficult to see faults. “It is in vain, that we would coldly turn, “To them that smile on us—.” Byron, I believe;—but I have no knack at such things; and what possessed me to quote poetry, I know not; and to quote him, of all men breathing; him, whom I so heartily execrate and despise. I don't know when I have been in such spirits. Your note, announcing that Frank had gone to New Orleans, has made my heart light; but the first had miscarried—I have not received it yet; let him wear the talisman, nevertheless; the tiger may cross his path, when he least expects it. But why not say more? You are on your return, I suppose.—Shall you renew your intimacy with Molton? I hope not. But if you do, hunt him out of his labyrinth. Read the within, and tell me what you think of it. It is the fifth, that I have received. I already tremble; and, above all, I would have you ascertain if Molton be married.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(ANONYMOUS, TO SARAH.) The life of Edward Molton has been an uninterrupted tissue of acts like the following. I make no apology for communicating them, after what I know of him, and, of Miss Gracie. Be it your business to communicate to her, so much of the whole, as will counteract the poison, that he has infused. Do not mistrust me. I say nothing of Molton's talent. I only say that there is but one way of restoring that heart to soundness, upon which he has once breathed. Beware of him. He is charged with many terrible crimes;—with seduction;—adultery;—murder. For the truth of these charges, I do not vouch; but there are facts, to the knowledge of which I have arrived, which I submit to you, in the following order, without comment. Confront him with them. Will he deny them? No—but perhaps he will obtain your ear. If he do—I know him—he will prevail. You ask me, if “I know Miss Gracie?” Believe me, you were very imprudent, in permitting yourself to ask me any such question, particularly in black and white. It is perilous; and although such confidence is precious to me—yet, on your account, I intreat you not to write to me again. What you have written, is sacred. It was rash, I confess, very rash in you, even to receive my notes. But, I do not mistake you. I know your motive; and I trust that my deportment has been such, as to convince you of my discretion. The only thing that I blame in you, is, your having acknowledged that you have received and read my notes. You ought not to let me know this---I am the last man that should know it. But, it is done now, and cannot be helped; so, let me reply to your question. Yes--- I did know Juliet Gracie. Nay, more---I loved her. But that is passed. Still, however, I would preserve her; watch over her, and restore her,---wasted and weary as she is, to happiness and health. Edward Molton, at an early age, manifested the most depraved inclinations. Before twelve, he was a confirmed liar; drank to excess; and stole whatever he could lay his hands on. He lived in solitude. He was the chief pest of his family, and the bye-word of the town. Among the transgressions of his youth, I can recollect several, such as the following. He has deliberately insulted a lady, at a large dinner table, in two instances, with an abrupt and brutal cruelty, that can only be palliated by supposing him ignorant of the commonest courtesies of life. Nay, he has presented a book, to one of the most accomplished and fascinating women, in our country, after violating the decorum of a family, by lending it to a youthful and superiour girl, who returned it, with this cutting remark. “I have read it, on your recommendation.---But, do not (as he had promised) do not lend it to your sister. I have no fear that it would corrupt her, but—.” She could say no more. And the former lady returned it, almost in tears. After a rude and shameful outrage too, upon a young girl, a sort of apprentice where he once lived, in which the consummation of his design was only prevented by his inebriety, and the interference of the lady, to whose government the girl was subject, he was a second time so forgetful of all that gives dignity to a man, that it was only by main force, that she escaped from his room, into which she had been beguiled. Not long since, in this very neighbourhood, he fell acquainted with a reputable married woman, a mother, travelling with her child; and ere he parted from her, which was at the end of a few hours ride, he made an assignation with her, to meet her at the house, where she stayed, and agreed to pass himself off for her brother. On another occasion, he entered, with a worthy and respectable man, without any introduction, into a house where the people of the place, (it was in the country,) were dancing. He soon singled out a young and interesting girl. Her lover was with her. She affronted Molton, and he determined to be revenged. He pursued her to her father's; and while the man, that was with him, sat down with a small company at cards, he employed himself in the work of ruin. Not a quarter of an hour had passed, before Molton was surprised by the father himself, in an unoccupied room, with his daughter. He met with a woman, whom he had once loved, after her marriage with another, at noonday, by a formal assignation; and the story is, that they were both inconceivably distressed. Nay, he once visited the wife of another man, in the absence of her husband; and who, he had every reason to believe, loved him, at night; and she was known to arise from her bed, and receive him. He fell in love, or at least, felt a singular interest in another girl, who was afterward married; and such was the infatuation of that woman, that she used to pass by his dwelling, continually, after her marriage, in the absence of her husband. He was criminally intimate with a woman, whom he introduced, in his audacity, at the peril of his life, not only into genteel and intelligent society, but into the house of his own mother;—or, rather, he attempted this, but heaven interfered, and disappointed him. Nay, I do know of his having successively pursued several women, for a long season, in one case, for whole years, without any serious design. But, there was one who had the spirit to requite him. She discovered the blackness of his heart;—and tore her's away from it, forever. Was it not noble?—heroick? They were to have been married. And who is she, with whom he now lives, in open defiance of public shame and honour? Perhaps her history may be none of the whitest, in the calendar of darkness. She is from England. One other, and I have done. That other is a case of singular atrocity. An innocent creature put herself in his way, in tears. Her sister had been betrayed. Molton counselled her against the falsehood and subtlety of man; and, when he had won her whole confidence, would, perhaps, have destroyed her, himself;—but she fled, and is safe. There is yet another. It is said, that he ran away, some time ago, with a sweet girl, from a nunnery, in Canada; was pursued, and shot, by the brother, on the way to New-York, where he fled, like a dastard. This tale is believed. And, since writing the above, two other cases have come to my recollection, which may avail something in your estimate of the man's character. He has been the cause of much jealousy between several married people; and, on one occasion, I know of his having secretly corresponded, for some time, with a woman;—an evidence of infatuation in her, surpassing aught that I have ever known: for she was a religious woman; the mother of several children; and she knew his character. Yet, she trusted herself to him. The last is a case, where he had insinuated himself into a house, how, it would be difficult to tell; for his manners are not conciliating—and suddenly ceased to go to it. Nay, I have reason to believe, that he was formally requested not to enter it, again. What could have been the reason? You will, probably, never hear from me, again. I have communicated all. That there are suspicious stories, different, and quite as shocking, of which the world has no mode of arriving at the truth, is true. But, I believe, that these are nearly all of his sins;—nay, I might say, positively, that they were all, except some of a less serious nature, the recital of which I shall spare you. Does he plead passion? No. He derides the plea. He has sinned, and continues to sin, in his own way, without consulting aught but his own heart; and what that monitor is, after such an uninterrupted violation of order and decorum, as I have exhibited to you, you may judge for yourself. And now—one word of advice to you. You are very imprudent. The evidence that you have given to me, is conclusive. My last advice is—Beware of Molton;—and watch over Juliet. Only one thing can save her—uninterrupted employment. She has an extraordinary genius;—but she is undisciplined, and unable, except at intervals, to sustain and cherish it, as it deserves. Let her know that it is better to toil, regularly, one hour a day, than to work one whole day, in a week; or one whole month, in a year. It becomes a habit, at last;—and she may gradually extend the time, until what would have intimidated her, at first, will become a matter, scarcely of observation, in her habitual practice. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JOHN. I write to you, again. I am terrified to death. I had entirely forgotten the deaf-and-dumb man. Yet something happened, a day or two since, which I was ashamed to confess. The thought appeared so childish. I was standing at a counter—I felt uneasy—I turned, and there he was—O, I should know his strange, melancholy eyes, wherever I met them. I was near fainting. When I recovered, he had gone. What a strange phantom it is, said I;—and, from that day to this, I have started at the tread, or voice, of every stranger that I have met. I rarely go abroad; and, when I do, I see his manner—his countenance—his very eyes, it would appear, at every turn. The consequence is, that I am sick—weary. I must leave Boston—I will. It is frightful, to me, to be so harassed. I feel like something haunted. But, as I was saying—I had recovered—I thought no more of him. But, just now—cousin, it is not ten minutes since he left me. I feel his touch yet. Would that he had spoken! O, with such eyes, such a forehead—if he would only speak, I am sure that—. No matter. He is not striking. I thought him remarkably so, at first. His physiognomy has nothing remarkable; but the expression—that it is, which startled me. It is imperial. The profile is bad—feeble, I think;—but, in front—No! how should I think of describing it? I only know, that he has, probably, saved my life; for, in crossing one of these vile slippery streets, here, I fell; and, at that instant, a carriage came thundering round the corner. The wheel touched me—I felt it—I almost felt the weight, crushing my bones. I was saved. The deaf-and-dumb creature saved me. He threw himself, they say, at the head of the horses, and turned them up the platform, so critically, that the fore-wheel passed over my foot, tearing and bruising it very slightly. Ah! I just begin to feel the pain. But where is he? I remember opening my eyes, while my father held me; and his countenance was near to mine—with a strange expression;—it made me shut them again. He disappeared. Nobody knows how;—and my father, I find, looks quite serious. Nay, I miss somewhat of his affectionate manner, now, more than ever. But enough of this. Give the enclosed to Juliet. SARAH RAMSAY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. You have often wished, dear Juliet, that my imperturbable nature, as you have called it, might meet with something to agitate it. Your wish is accomplished. I am agitated, cruelly agitated; not with the passion of love, that to which you seemed to look, with most assurance, for the desired effect; but with a strange, inexplicable inquietude—intensely painful and distressing, at times;— and yet, so pleasant withal, that I would not entirely forego it. You will be startled when you know the fact. I have been pursued—haunted—for the last two months, by a deaf-and-dumb man. Who he is, or what is his object, I cannot conjecture; but he is, incessantly, about my path, besetting me at every turn, and occupying my thought, and all my dreaming. At times, I feel no little terrour about him; and then, my compassion for one so helpless and heroick, for there is really something heroick in his manner, entirely overcomes my terrour,—and I only wish, while the tears fall from my eyes, that I were his sister, or some friend, and authorized to administer that consolation, which one so desolate and dark, must require.— He has just saved my life. (Here followed an account of the transaction, exactly as it is related in the preceding letter, as to the facts; but the comments were more feeling and animated.) I promised to keep a sort of journal, you know;—and I was as good as my promise, until I had been so disturbed, by the frequent recurrence of this poor creature to my thought, that I abandoned it. The last part of it, that is intelligible, even to me, I find, is that, which describes a visit to the battle-ground, near the Falls of Niagara. I send it to you, just as it is. It was written with a trembling hand, you perceive; but a still more trembling heart, I can assure you. May 14th.—Went to the battle-ground, in company with an officer, who was in the action, and under the command of colonel Millar. There is no hill, such as I expected to see, where the British artillery was posted; and several material errours, that my father had fallen into, from reading the account by Maj. —, were corrected. After the Americans had obtained possession of the battery, they never lost it. The British, it is true, made several desperate charges; but were always unsuccessful. The notion that prevails, generally, is, that it was lost and won, several times. But, let me tell the whole, as nearly as I can, in the words of the officer. He was young, handsome, and modest; and, while he led us over the ground, he pointed out the particular spot, where any transaction of interest had occurred;—showed us where he had stood—where Millar was, when he was asked, if he could “carry that battery?” and replied, with more soldier-like pith than any Spartan ever did—“I'll try.” “The order came, to storm the battery,” said the officer. “I was in front of my company. I had never been closely engaged before:—a few skirmishes, only, had been the whole of my experience. My feelings were not the most creditable to a soldier. I could have turned, and run, with a good heart, had not all the eyes of my men been upon me. We pushed on, at double quick time. I was near enough to see the faces of the men at their guns. Just at that moment, I saw one of my lads gradually sinking to the ground, with a face so horribly pale and ghastly, that I forgot my own terrour, instantly. I struck him with my sword;—it was like electricity. He stood erect; and I gave immediate orders, in a loud voice, to bayonet the first man that lagged. The sound of my own voice gave me new heart. Colonel Millar, too, was just in the rear, walking leisurely, backward and forward, with an enormous quid of tobacco in his mouth, which, all who saw him, could see. You would not easily T guess the effect of such a trivial matter. But I have known that kind of unconcern, more effectual, in giving life to the soldiers, than the sternest and steadiest countenance. It turns the current of their thought from danger. A stern visage. on the contrary, teaches them that there is something to be feared; else, why such preparation? Nay, I once saw General Ripley, when the shot was raining in upon us, address an officer, near me, thus: “A pinch of your snuff, if you please, lieutenant.” Sir, we could have stormed—I beg your pardon, madam. I forgot, then, that you were so near. Well, we reserved our fire. The battery opened upon us—but they fired over our heads. We were about four hundred, and they were many times as numerous. We had been waiting, impatiently, for the word. It came. Fire! We took deliberate aim, and poured in our balls, like hail, upon the men at the pieces. Every shot told. We saw them tumbling about their guns, in dozens. When we carried the battery, we turned it, immediately, upon them. We continued to be reinforced; and the enemy, we soon saw, meditated an attack, in turn. Then was the time of trial. All about us, there was a dead silence. We could hear the heavy roll of Niagara, however; and, now and then, a straggling shot, fired in the trepidation of some soldier. The moon was bright and beautiful; and the black clouds that were driven across it, by a strong wind, presented every variety of shadow and light. At one time, in the darkness, the enemy had approached so near, that we thought him a part of our troops. It was about eleven o'clock, at night.” There, dear Juliet, I have given it to you, nearly in his own words. Ever thine, SARAH. P. S.—I am not a little mortified, dear Juliet, to find that, after all, I have been in no kind of danger! The carriage, it now appears, was not near me. I have this, from my father, who, I am afraid, has discovered the stranger. I await his questioning. with anxiety. In your reply, tell me how you are situated. How does Jane bear herself toward you? Is that aunt of hers, there? If so, I do pity you. Who is Mr. Grenville? What is he?--- I wait your opinion of him, for particular reasons, in confidence. There are some strange reports here. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. (Bearing nearly the same date, with one from her to him. The letters had passed each other on the road.) Sarah, my poor brother is an altered man, indeed. I thought that he had more fortitude—more strength; or, rather, I did not believe that, with such a soul as he has, he could ever become so utterly prostrate, as I found him. He was pale; and there was something, in that paleness, that frightened me. So few weeks had passed, since we saw him, so gay and hearty;—and now, his lips were parched; his eyes sunken and fiery; his form so emaciated. I sat down by him. I took his hand; nay—why need I conceal it—I fell upon his bosom, and wept. There was an unnatural gaiety in his voice, too, that went to my heart. I asked him if he had received my letter in season, (with a little money, which I had enclosed to him.) He grasped my hand. His voice trembled. I inquired into his intentions. They were to go to New Orleans. I was constantly with him, for the first week; and there came a letter for him, directed to my care, from Molton. What could it be? I thought that his heart would burst, when he read it. “Accursed slanderer!” he cried, tearing it, and trampling on it, like a madman. I asked him the cause of his wrath—he tried to tell me, but he could not—he was choking;—and all that I could understand, was, that he, Molton, had slandered Juliet. If that be true—that—it will be enough. I shall soon see him, and I shan't leave him, till I know the truth.— Frank's baggage is, already, on board the vessel; or, I really believe, that he would return to see Molton;—but, from the look of his eyes, I don't think that there will be much danger of his wrath cooling in this voyage; and his honour, I find, is engaged to undertake it. I am glad of it. I had rather meet Molton, than let Frank meet him;—and, unless he play me some trick, which I am half inclined to suspect, from certain mysterious movements this morning, I shall see Molton long before he will. But, I must stay here awhile. I must see him fairly on board; and then, I will return. In the mean time, let your letters be directed as usual. There is a fellow at Jane's, who will take care of them, for me. Poor Frank!—there he is!—leaning upon the table, with his hands pressed hard against his temples. I must finish. It will not do to leave him, alone, for an instant. Dear Sarah, adieu. Charleston, S. C. JOHN. P. S.—I open this to say, that I have discovered the truth. Molton has offered Juliet to him! Frank is delirious with passion, in consequence. I know not what it means; but I will know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK OMAR. Philadelphia, — It may lighten my brother's heart, to know, that the story which he has heard of Molton's baseness, toward Marion, M. P. is untrue; and that, to have felt a regard for him, is not so terrible a reproach, to a modest woman, as he has thought. I have made particular inquiries, and have been so fortunate, as to find the very gentleman, at last, who, it was said, came so near being deceived by Molton. The facts, as related by him, are these:—“Molton never loved her, and never affected to love her: on the contrary, she, herself, has always spoken of him, as having conducted himself in the most honourable manner. She was an ambitious, smart, showy woman, and Molton was on intimate terms with her, for years;—but, while I knew that he had no intention of marrying her,” said this gentleman, “because he, more than once, left off visiting her, on account of such a report, informing her of the reason, at the time—I knew, also, that their acquaintance was not only perfectly innocent, but discreet. Nay, ask Molton himself. What he tells you, you may depend upon. It is true, that I loved Marion—devoutly—to infatuation;—and, it is also true, that I became acquainted with her, through the means of Molton; and that, after we separated, she was seriously ill, and went, for a few days, into the country, accompanied by Molton. Here, my knowledge of Marion and him terminated. There never was a more cruel and murderous slander, than this, of which you speak; and, were it not as ridiculous, as cruel, I should be tempted to hunt up the author. I have heard it before;—but I laughed at it. There is not one word of truth, from beginning to end, in the induction that has been so wickedly drawn, from a few simple facts. The lady was imprudent, I have no doubt; for all women are so, to a degree, when in love. But she was innocent. I'll stake my life on that. Molton was always too high minded, with all his faults, to deceive a friend, so basely. I was his friend; and he spoke to me of her faults, and virtues, without disguise. Nay, he told me all their acquaintance. She deceived me. She told me that he had, repeatedly, offered himself to her. I doubted this;—and, when I told him, he denied it in such a way, and with such evidence, as left me in no kind of doubt. No—the truth was, that she liked Molton. I do not believe that she loved him;—and, I believe, that she would have won him, if she could. I know that she tried hard,” Thus much for his story. From another quarter, I learn, that the rest of the slander is as base a fabrication. Yet, the facts are nearly the same. “She did not die in childbed. She is living yet. But T 2 her husband was, probably, induced to address her, in consequence of what Molton said to him. Nor, is it true, that there was any secret cause, for the interruption of the acquaintance between Molton and the family. It was a plain matter of fact. He is haughty, bitter, and sarcastick; and, when once provoked, difficult to appease. He affronted her, deliberately; and, as deliberately, repented of it. The first cause of their coolness was accidental; but it soon became so serious, that the father was obliged to interfere. Molton has since been sensible of his unmanly and unworthy conduct; and, I am sure, if he ever have an opportunity, he will make an atonement proportioned to his transgression. Perhaps the birth of the child may be premature. The story abroad is so, I confess. But I would pledge my soul, for the innocence of Molton;—and he, I am sure, would put his against the man, that would dare to insinuate aught against the purity of his acquaintance with that woman.” Nay, brother, you may depend upon this; for Molton, himself, has told me, in plain language, the whole extent of her imprudence with him. It amounted only to a few tears;— but, he declares, that he never even kissed her, in his life; and I believe him. “No,” says he, “she is an innocent and wronged creature, so far as I know anything of her; and I have been very intimate with her, and for a long time.” Farewell. I shall direct this to Messrs. Fairman and Baits, of New-Orleans, with leave to forward it, if you should have left there. Juliet is well. Sarah, I imagine, is somewhat in love!—with a deaf-and-dumb man, too!—but that is hardly to be wondered at, where one is so able and willing to talk enough for two:—it would be no serious objection to her, that he could not speak—nor to him, that he could not hear! I shall tell her so, next. Dear brother, yours. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO GEORGE STAFFORD. No, Stafford, I never liked Byron. He wants natural steadiness and grandeur. He is too full of affectation.— Nothing is unpremeditated, with him; nothing permament. His ambition is affected; his melancholy affected; and so are his love and his misanthrophy. If he really suffered, he would not be so forward to tell of it. Men seek concealment in their calamity, whenever that calamity is accompanied with wounded self-love. Not so with Byron. Whatever happens to him, is for the publick. His family distresses—the holiness of his home —the sanctity of a loved one, whose heart is bruised and sore, with his unkindness, in her retirement, are all exhibited as so many spectacles. His passions, and thoughts, are nothing more to him, than a kind of ware, with which he supplies the market—a theatrical company, which he lets out to the mob, for tragedy or comedy, prose or verse. To-day the public appetite is for the moody and mysterious. Byron profits by it. He marshals a score of heroes, all of the same family; and exhibits them, with such an air of reality, and with so many of his own diseased attributes, that the world are willing to believe that they are drawn from life. Ridiculous. Two or three things alone that I find in his poetry, are enough to convince me, that Byron is, naturally, a pleasant, harmless, inoffensive sort of fellow, with no more gall nor bitterness of heart, than many a man, who is never suspected of having any at all. A sort of notion seems to prevail, that he is blood-thirsty. I do not believe it. Nor do I even believe that he is really a brave man. My reason is this; and it is quite enough for me. He has published a note, to his British Bards, and Scotch Reviewers, which no brave man ever would have published. He speaks of having waited for the vengeance of whosoever might see fit to assail him, after he had published the first edition. Can anything be pleasanter? What had he said so perilous, to his personal safety? Nothing. But of whom was it said?—of a set of poets—the most patient of God's creatures, where powder and ball are concerned, though the most sensitive and unappeasable, where the paper bullets of the brain “only,” are to be encountered. No—Stafford. Byron is not a great man;—by this, I mean, that he has not that quality which makes bad men great, at times,—immobility. Every thing shakes him; every thing disturbs him. That he is a great poet, I do not deny. But while I admit that, in a part of his labour he has never been excelled, yet I will maintain that no man has written a greater proportion of abominable trash. The fashion will soon have gone by, as it was with Walter Scott's poems, and will be with the novels that are attributed to him, now. But this must not be known. People forget the past, and regard the present, as an exception to the vicissitude of fashion. If I should say, therefore, that the time is close at hand, when Byron's poems, and the Scotch novels, will be found on the same shelf with Scott's poems, covered with dust; a drug in Booksellers shops; and a part, too sacred to be touched, of the library—I should be laughed at. Yet, it will be so. The fashion is passing away. The measure and manner of Byron, is worn out; and the novel writer is exhausted. I can remember, when it was little else than blasphemy to utter aught, against the poems of Walter Scott;—I can remember when they were found upon every table, every toilet; when they were cited on all occasions; and his songs were to be heard, at every turn. Then it would have been thought madness to predict, what has since happened. Then, there was no such poetry, as Walter Scott's poetry; no such poet as Walter Scott. The Edinburgh Reviewers ranked him with Homer!—and Lord Byron swore that his rhymes should live, when England was no more!—How is it now? No bookseller is willing to have them upon his shelves.— They are seen upon no table—no toilet;—and nobody pretends now, that Walter Scott was ever any thing more than a pleasant, fiery sort of a rhymer; who, after drawing two or three strong characters, kept the same, continually before the publick, in different dresses, and under different names, until they, simple souls, without suspecting the cause, grew tired of him, and his company, and come to their senses. The true reason was, that, in his new works, there was nothing new;—nothing in character, measure, image, and little in incident. Had the name been unchanged, the whole might have passed for one story. Bating a catastrophe, now and then, they had more connexion than the cantos of Childe Harold; and, finally it has come to this, that, of all his poems, that which first made him popular, the Lady of the Lake, is the only one that is ever spoken of now, with complacency. Will this be the fate of the novels? Undoubtedly.— Though I do not believe, that Walter Scott is the author, for they are full of strength and destitute of ornament; yet I believe that they will share the fate of the poems, and that Byron's labour will go with them. Nay—is it not so now? Has not his lordship discovered the fact; and adopted another manner, entirely contradictory to his old, in that Don Juan, which you have sent me?— By the way, I should have written to you, on the subject of that poem, when I first received it, but I was constantly travelling. Yet, I shall endeavour to say a word or two here, before we part. But are there not other reasons, separate from the fickleness of publick opinion, which may lead to this result? I think that there are. They have been much too popular, and too suddenly and vehemently popular. Such things, no matter what their merit is, cannot last. Besides, after admitting the merit of the writer, the dramatick distinctness of his characters; for, after all, that is his chief, if not his only merit, for there is nothing remarkable in his style;—there are so many drawbacks, so much trash—so many chapters of tiresome pedantry--- horology—law---heraldry---history---and stuff, relative to individuals, that can be interesting only to those who know the parties, that I should not fear to utter the prediction, solely on that ground. But a great and conspicuous fault is this; that all his leading characters are the same. He seems to have no conception of mind, distinct from the body. With him, the same body has always the same soul. Recall for a moment some of them, and point out to me where the real difference is. It is only in a greater or less degree of vulgarity—and that, oftener in the dress and situation, than in the language; for his low-born often talk better than the high-born.— In every tale, there is a deformed man;—with long arms and prodigious personal strength:—there is Dirk Hatterick, Ashley Osbaldeston—Rob Roy—the little Black Dwarf—and the great Black Dwarf, for example, all with the devil in their hearts.—And here I cannot help making a remark that has long had weight with me.—However it may be with Walter Scott, who I am told is lame, I was sure, the moment that I saw Byron, (and I did not know that he was clubfooted, till then) that that was the chief cause of his bitterness and hostility to men. The mind accustoms itself to regard the body of a man, like his countenance, as in character with his spirit. There is the crook backed “tyrant” of Shakspeare, whom by the way, I suppose you know to have been a “marvellous proper man,” and no more crook-backed than I am. Such men, like the diminutive and weak, cannot be magnanimous. What would be forbearance in the strong and valiant, would be, in them, but pusillanimity. They are viewed with an evil eye.— Women avoid them—and fools, with better faces and feet, get ahead of them. The consequence is, that they become dark, unforgiving, and terrible;—their hearts secrete a continual poison;—what is aliment to others, the smile of beauty, the movement and grace of fashionable life—is bitterness and death to them.—Love and women are to them a perpetual taunt. They cannot be loved—they know that;—if they have any ambition, they aim to be feared, as the next best thing, accessible to them. But I am wandering again. Let us return. There is also a series of mad women, you know, running through the whole set of these novels—Meg Merillies; Madge Wildfire; Ulrica; Edith; Helen McGregor; Norna of the Fitful-Head; and one or two others, whom I cannot recollect. And, after deducting these two sets of dwarfs and mad women, what have we like a character left; —nothing but what is common to many novels, if we except Claverhouse, which is only a sketch; Rebecca; Minna; and Di Vernon; and the Waverly Heroine (who are all one) and the Knight Templar.—The others are paltry. And I do say that we shall see the time, and soon too, when few persons will have the patience to read through some of them, which are now thought the most of—as Waverly, for instance. Can any thing be more tiresome than the first one or two hundred pages of Waverly—excepting some part of the latter? I can remember when it first appeared. I read it with great difficulty. It was the most irksome thing to me, that I had ever met with—such was the general sentiment, too. But the Scotch Reviewers pronounced it a miracle; and we, in our humility, echoed the edict. They, too, have declared that “Old Mortality” and “Waverly” are the best of the collection. We have been fools enough to believe them. And yet, Stafford, to an Englishman, or an American, they are the most tiresome; and, for the very reason that they are the most grateful to a Scot—their extreme particularity and locality. No wonder that a Scot finds entertainment in the barbarous gibberish of the natives; but must we, in spite of our teeth, be pleased too, with what is unintelligible to us? I hope not. No —the fact is that the best of these novels are those that are not national—Guy Mannering is the best—I vanhoe the next. They are stories that men relish, who never heard of Scotland, and never wish to hear of it. The characters are not individuals—but species:—the language is not provincial, but universal. But the epidemick for Scotch poetry—cloaks—ribbands—novels—criticism—science—and musick, is rapidly passing off.— We begin to be only rationally disquieted by it. But—if I am to say anything of Don Juan, I must do it soon; my paper is nearly out. My first notion is, that it is merely a piece of pleasantry in Lord Byron; and that the world have sadly mistaken him, in supposing that he had any design, good or bad, in sending it abroad. That it is profligate, I admit;—but, is it more so, than Shakspeare?—his Romeo and Juliet—nay—even his Lear —or is it half so coarse and brutal as his Othello? Why even now, after the pruning of a whole century—a decent woman can hardly sit it out, without blushing to the very heart. Nay—there is the whole school of Beaumont and Fletcher—Madam Centlivre;—and even that most genteel piece of obscenity, that was ever tolerated upon any stage, the SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL—the greatest outrage upon decency that I know;—and all the novels of Smollet and Fielding—are they not unspeakably more coarse and shameful? They are. But do not suppose that I mean to justify or plead for Byron.— No. But I mean to say that, while the blasphemy, and detestable licentiousness of his poems are complained of— it would be more decent to complain of it, a little more temperately; and after reading a little in Milton and Shakspeare. Treat it as it is—sneer at it, as the pastime of a wicked, dissolute man, worth reading, on account of its vivacity; but not to be dreaded, as it is, like death and rottenness, to the human heart. There, your reviewers were foolish;—but they have set the fashion, and we have followed it. They have called it the ne plus ultra of genius and wickedness; and we have repeated it. The opinion is false. It is no such wonderful thing,— except for its eccentricity, as coming from the misanthrope. You see with what facility it has been imitated. There are parts in both of the works that I sent you, so like the best part of Juan, that it would be difficult to detect the counterfeit. Nay, nothing is easier;—and the ridiculous doctrine of association, I take it, was first gravely followed in Byron's Childe Harold. There, he was forever wandering. And it is my serious opinion, that, having become sensible, that it was easy to make that habit, and consequently, the writer, ridiculous, he tried his hand at Beppo, by way of anticipating such ridicule. M. G. Lewis did the same thing, you know, with his Giles Jollop. Don Juan, therefore, is only a parody upon Childe Harold, by the author himself.— And what is this association? That which keeps a man continually turning. The author thinks of a horse—that reminds him of Bucephalus—that, of a shadow—that, of the moon—that, of lunaticks—that, of mad Lee—that, of poor Swift—that, of racing—that, of the Olympian games—that, of cards—boxing—bull fights—Elgin marbles—gladiators---Greece—Liberty—the Turks—Emperor Alexander, &amp;c. &amp;c. in short, of every thing, and anything, but the subject in hand. And that is association! I have now done. If you would have the venom of Don Juan diluted,—make less noise about it. That is a sure way. At present, people are ambitious of trying the strength of their constitutions. Ever yours—Dear Stafford. MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. Yes, my dear Sarah, it is time that I should forget myself, for a while, and remember those that are now, as I have been, away and apart from their home. I have received all your letters, I dare say; for none are missing; and, until your last, I had contented myself with replying to them, at second hand, believing that I was acquainted with all. I was mistaken, I see, now; and though not disposed to take you very seriously to task in the matter, yet, I do think it a part of my duty to treat it somewhat so. I am afraid that you do not think enough of this strange correspondence. No, I do not express what I wish; but I mean to ask you, if it be not rather more grave a matter, than you are willing to acknowledge, even to your own heart. For my own part, I will tell you, frankly, that, since Mr. John Omar's return, we have had a long conversation about you; and I made no scruple to keep the extent of my knowledge a secret, until I had arrived at the limit of his. He is naturally unsuspicious; and, when he found how completely I had tricked him, with all my artlessness, as you have been pleased to call it, he really looked a little U angry, and coloured; nay, I do not know but he might have said some spiteful thing, had not the gentleman, about whom you are concerned, been present. However, we were all good friends again, in ten minutes; and continued our chatting. He declares, without any hesitation, that you are in love, at last; but then, no human being can believe that he is serious; for he seems to have taken up the very character of extravagance, levity, and frolick, that his excellent brother threw off, so wisely, just before he left us. Indeed, I have been frequently struck at these changes. Unlike as they appear to be, from all that I am able to discover, and every observation adds new strength to my opinion, they are really so very much alike, as to be able to change characters, completely. Thus much, and in this grave way too, to prepare you for what is to follow. But do not be terrified. I do not mean to carry these airs much further. I was never made for a preceptress—and, I find it not a little awkward to give advice;—so, what I do give now, must be charitably taken; or, I have done playing Minerva. I have thought over your whole acquaintance, with the stranger, so far as it has been communicated to me; and the result is, that I hardly know what to say. I cannot say that you have been imprudent; for, if the poor creature would follow you, how could you help it? But— I fear that---pardon me, Sarah. I declare that it brings the water into my eyes, to say it, even half in earnest— I fear that you have been imprudent, in some way. Before I said this, I should have asked you perhaps; but would not the question itself imply that I suspected you? Yet, let me tell you, from what I judge. You are such an altered creature. Your very hand writing is disordered; and your language is so, too. Now and then, by flashes, a spirit breaks out, that I never saw before. This, again, is succeeded by words,—single words, and phrases, which are really alarming, when I remember what you have been. They are mournful, touching, yet natural. By this, I do not mean that you were ever affected, or unnatural, but that these are heart-felt. They have distressed me, me, who knew you so well, when, perhaps, another, not so familiar with your style, would observe nothing of the kind, in them. But Sarah, let me assure you—I can safely say, that, in all the letters together, which you have written to me, since we left Philadelphia, (and they fill a large part, of a very large drawer,) there is not so much passion, and brokenness, and strange beauty and fervour, as in two or three of your last. Yet, you have experienced many vicissitudes; and though there was once, a singular abruptness—a masculine vigour, (have you forgotten that?) in your style; yet, it wore off, and you were remarkable for serenity, until of late, when you have returned, all at once, to it. Passion is always abrupt;—so is strong emotion. Indeed, you had become so sober, at one time, and so severe, that I almost trembled to write to you. But now; —how is it, now?—Ah, Sarah—you have a woman's heart, after all! and I can prattle with you again, as freely as ever. But—“a deaf-and dumb man.” what am I to think of you? That you are interested in him? Yes—that you love him? No.—Take care, Sarah; you are too confident of your own strength. You are daring, too.—If you love—deafness, dumbness, blindness, would hardly be a fatal objection to you. Consider of this well. The advice had better be months too early, than one moment too late. If I know any thing of symptoms, yours are sufficiently decided; and my opinion is—That you are cruelly deceiving yourself. I may be wrong, but such is my belief. If you thought that you felt any tenderness for the poor creature, you would tremble to speak of him. You would be ashamed, and terrified. You would stifle the thought, immediately, at the risk of suffocation; for in her sober senses, any rational woman would do this, as a matter of religious duty. I forbear to urge any argument on this point. If argument be necessary—it is already too late. No, my dear, dear Sarah, your danger, I am sure, lies in your self confidence. You are “cruelly agitated,” without suspecting the cause. The deaf-and-dumb man is the cause. Your proud heart is the cause. I hope that I am mistaken;—but, O, Sarah, your letters; such, from such a woman as you, now that I see them all, and know the whole, do alarm me—inexpressibly. That a girl, who has scarcely read a dozen novels in her life; whom I have seen laughing over some of the most pathetick, and sentimental scenes of the drama;—one, on whom all poetry that tells of “love, still love,” operated, only to make her beautiful lips curl, in scorn—that she should be so at the mercy, of one or two whimsical adventures, as to believe—but, before I advance another step, Sarah, let me beg of you, to answer me—do I know all---is there nothing untold;---nothing---I ask you, seriously;---and I will tell you, why. It appears to me so utterly improbable that Sarah Ramsay should be troubled in this way, merely by the circumstance of having been once in a grave-yard, with a deaf-and-dumb man; by having seen him, at glimpses, and doubtfully, two or three times; and, having been assisted in a trying moment, by the same person, even were that assistance as critically rendered, as she at first supposed.---Nay, this seems so impossible, I might say, that I am driven to the belief that there is something untold. Yes---there is.--- Sarah, my dearest friend! my sister! my dear Sarah! I implore you to tell me. It will ease your own heart.--- But, if it may be---for there are some things; some, that a woman will not tell to her own heart; some, that she should not.---If this be one of them---it is enough. I am satisfied, without wringing the confidence, like blood, from your poor heart. Yes---satisfied; for this letter will do all that such confidence could. It will awaken you, dear Sarah, to a sense of your danger. Nay, it were better perhaps, that I should not know more, whatever there may be to tell. We are sadly unwilling to relinquish such things. I have found it so;—and the heart of woman is always young, tender, and mute, till that feeling of shame is gone, But then, when she has once learnt to talk of the forbidden thing; once taught her lips to pronounce the forbidden name—once learnt to hear her own voice discourse upon the theme of treachery, she becomes, like the true coward, preternaturally brave.— Thus, it is said, that women never stop half way with crime or virtue;—and thus I am sure, they that have been under any constraint, become imprudent, when that is removed. That feeling of shame, Sarah, has been an unreasonable restraint to you. Even if you have felt tenderness, you have never dared to show it. The fear of ridicule appalled you. It is not wonderful; ridicule has shaken stouter minds than women ever ought to have.— I could never love her, whom it would not disturb. It may be better, therefore, that we should not speak at all on this subject, again;---no matter whether it be, at present, a trifle, or not. Because, unless we agree to this, I should expect you to laugh at me, if it were a trifle; and should conclude of course, if you did not, that it was serious.—Otherwise, I may live to hear the insensible Sarah, muttering a sweet formal incantation aloud, to the blind boy; invoking him, by some name—which, but to have heard pronounced by another, once, would have been death to the poor trembler.—There, my dear Sarah; have I not played my part mighty well? I think that I have; and I am sure that you will think me fairly quit for some of your ancient lecturing, on similar subjects, when I wanted a guardian, dear, more than you ever will. And now, let me take a more natural tone. I should be really glad to hear, that my beloved Sarah, whom I know better than they that think her cold and insensible, had some truly romantick, high-hearted fellow for a husband—not for a lover—the romance of a lover is too often sickening and artificial; but, when a husband, a sensible husband is romantick, the character is respectable; and the deep, thrilling, passionate beauty of romance is never so well set off, as by dignity and wisdom. To such a man, would I fain see my Sarah wedded. I should be happy, then;—or, if that be too much, for we are seldom happy here, I believe; and it is better for us, that we should not be, I should be less unhappy than I have been. Yet that is saying little.—Supply the deficiency yourself, dear Sarah; and believe, as I do, that it U 2 is better for us, these trials and disappointments, this weltering of the heart at times; or, they wean us from unsubstantial things. And why should we complain?— surely not, that we have found the truth at last!—Do we complain that we are awakened from a delirious slumber? Would we be deceived, forever?—lie, forever and ever, dreaming of imaginary virtue, in imaginary beings?— No, Sarah;—and, instead of sorrowing that the delusion has passed; and that the wicked are no longer seen as they were wont to be, on beauty and majesty, we ought to rejoice. And so we should, were it not for our self love.-- We cannot bear to confess that we have been duped— cheated, so miserably, as we sometimes are, into enthusiasm for the wicked and—but whither am I wandering?—Sarah—I have given you a practical illustration, of what I cautioned you against, in the last page; and I would tear this out, with a blush, and a few tears perhaps, at mine own weakness, were I not more ashamed of such a weakness, at such a time. Perhaps however, with me, it is a symptom of strength, rather than passion, that I am able to support any allusion to this painful subject. There was a time, when I could not;— nay, it is not long, since the most delicate touch would have taken my breath away. I can think of it all, now, more steadily; my feelings are strangely altered; and I cannot readily believe that my heart is already so sound as it appears;—I choose rather to believe that the wound is festering yet;—that “the living stream lies quick below.” While I believe this, I shall be more safe. It is dangerous reviving certain associations. I have experienced that. It is like retreading on crushed flowers with our naked feet. We may affect to go there, with indifference; we may know that there is no fragrance, no beauty left; but the very earth is aromatick, impregnate with their essence. The odour and oil follow us--haunt us---even in our sleep. This looks well. When people can talk so, there is, in general, little to be feared; but I have learnt caution---and this, I hope, is for the last time with me. And as for you, Sarah, the edict against you, is in full force. You are not to allude to the past. And now, let me reply to your kind questioning. It is very true, dear Sarah, that I am not so happily situated as I could wish; but why should I disquiet you? You cannot relieve me; and we are too far apart, for such safe correspondence, as would justify me in dealing very plainly. Beside, I have lost a part of my sensibility, by recovering my health. I feel more serious, and am told that my manners are so. Yet, I do not think that there is any affectation of solemnity about me;—perhaps there may be, of cheerfulness, sometimes; for, when my heart has been right heavy, on some foolish account or other, I have tried to avoid alike, the appearance of melancholy or dejection, which might be mistaken for pensiveness, or sentimentality; and that of great spirits, which all women are apt enough to assume, whenever their hearts are touched by disappointment. Do I write as I used to? It appears to me that I do not. I think that I am getting more into your manner, your old manner, I mean; for your new one is quite a novelty!—there's no denying that. Of one thing, I can truly assure you. It is this. I never knew what were the consolations, or what was the vitality of religion, till death had been brought home to me. You will rejoice with me, that this knowledge has boen purchased so cheaply. I begin to think many things less valuable; and to look upon many others with different eyes, than I did. Perhaps there is a certain evil pride—as well as some respect for religion, at the bottom of this. If you think so, aid me to detect it. Yes, Miss Matilda is here, and is much kinder to me, than before. Jane, alas, has had her trial, too. We have seen but little of her, lately. So many deaths in the family, I fear, have broken her spirits. Her manner is not very cordial; and she is very thin; but I am sure that her heart, poor girl, is kinder than it appears; and when we recollect how mistaken has been her education; how dazzlingly beautiful she has been; and then look at her now, so wasted and pale, from confinement and real inability to bring her powerful mind into action, without the excitement of admiration, perpetually and publickly administered, it is not wonderful that she is somewhat less kind, than formerly. But Jane is a noble girl, after all. I know of many a sick heart that she hath comforted; and were it not that her virtues are too stern and masculine, she would be an example of discretion for the age. Of Mr. Grenville, I cannot permit myself to say much, because I have not known him long. Some years ago, we met; and I took up an opinion against him, which, like some others, I have had good reason to change.— He remembers you; and you may have heard me speak of him. He is about thirty-eight, I should judge; but looks much younger. His mind is active and free, and betrays an agreeable general information, that makes him courted a good deal. I could not judge, whatever were my ability, which is very slight, as you know, of his depth or solidity, on so short an acquaintance; but, I am at present disposed to think him an amiable man, with good character, settled habits, a handsome fortune, and, probably, a warm heart. Are you disposed for a bargain? Come, what say you? I have no doubt; nay, I am sure that he is well fitted to make any woman happy, who may be ready to give up her heart to him. Only think, Sarah—a snug fortune, (though that, I know, is nothing to you—heigho!—but a little money, after all, is apt to be a very comfortable—no, not, a little money—that is one of the uncomfortable things of this life; for, if it were not, I know not who would be more comfortable than many a sweet girl in this neighbourhood.) There, Sarah, farewell. I do not know when I have fallen, so naturally, into my old humour; but the serious face that I could not help fancying you in, when you wrote that interrogatory about Mr. Grenville, did divert me, that's the truth on't; and I laughed heartily, when I came to it, again, in answering you. Yet—you must not laugh; at least, not at him. He is far too respectable for such pastime, I assure you. Once more, farewell dear Sarah, and accept this long, endless letter, as an offset to some of yours—(quite equivocal that!) JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. O, Sarah!—Sarah! What have I seen. Where have I been! With whom have I been confederating? Stop. Are you alone? If not, go to your room. Lock the door. Now listen. Is the paper spotted? Are the spots red? Do not shudder, do not, though they be. Stay—I will be calm. The red stains that you see there—there—they are continually shifting to be sure, but some will be there, when you open the letter—they are blood. It is Molton's blood. He is an adulterer. Mary Howard is an adultress. Helen Molton is an adultress! She abandoned her husband—and fled with Molton. Retribution has been done upon him. He is dying. The blessed Saint is avenged. Juliet is avenged. William is avenged. Frank, and the husband, and the poor, poor father, all are avenged. His blood is upon my hands, at this moment—I cannot wash it off. I have washed, and washed—and wept upon it—but no, it will not depart. But let me tell the story calmly—wait a little while * * * I went at nine o'clock, this morning, to see Molton. I took my pistols with me. I was desperate. I did not believe him guilty. He had told me a plausible story about Helen; and I believed it. But he never told me—ah, this blood—the smell is very offensive— do you know any thing that will take it out, Sarah?— He never told me that she was married to another, when he came away;—still less, that it was her husband, whom he had slain, upon the beach.—O, no—if he had, I should never have deserved the reproach of intimacy with a man, at the head of whose table, sat his mistress.—No;— I knew that she was his wife; that is, I thought so;—and I kept the secret, because he prayed it. I—I—. Well—let me to my story—. As I approached the house, I was willing to see if Molton was in his study; and I went through the wood, therefore, at the back of the house. I thought it a pity to be disappointed again. I saw him. I knocked. The servant denied him. I wrote a line—what, I know not; but, here is the answer; on the very card, too, just as it was written. “Young man.—I shall be at your service, at 10. It is now, 9¼, by my watch.” E. M. I was unwilling to leave the gate; but, I had some sense of decorum left. I turned my horse into the wood, and rode about, determining never to quit him, alive, till he had satisfied me, as to what he had said of Juliet; what he wrote to Frank; and what Frank meant, by that mysterious allusion to the death of William. I had seen Juliet, several times, while I was waiting to see Molton; for he had been constantly denied to me, 'till I would bear it no longer. But she knew it not. At ten, precisely, I rang the bell. I was conducted in. Molton was in his dressing gown; and was paler and thinner, nay, sadder, I thought, than I had ever seen him. Am I intelligible? I must tell you all my weakness. My heart smote me, for a moment. I felt as if I were choking. Might I not have been too precipitate? How could he look so—if—my blood mounted again. No— he was not innocent, look as he would! I know not what I said; but he sat, I remember, leaning upon his hand, with his eyes lifted, mournfully and fixedly upon mine; and the first words that he uttered, in reply, were merely these: and they were very calmly uttered. “You have brought your pistols, I suppose?” “Yes,” I replied, unwrapping them, and offering him one. He put it back, gently, and with a smile; a sickly, wan smile, not so much in derision, the habitual one of his face, at such moments, as in compassion, or pity. “Nay, sir—take it—take one—you shall take one;” said I, determined not to relent. He took one; but, with a carelessness, that looked more as if he wanted to convince me that he was just as little in my power then, as before, than to exchange a shot. I trembled with passion. What! might I not be permitted to harm him, with a loaded pistol in his hand? Defenceless, I could not. That, were the work of an assassin. But now, I prepared to fire—I levelled. What prevented me, I know not.—There was a dead silence. His melancholy eyes were rivetted upon mine, like one, weary of life, willing to die, but sorry to die, by the hand of one that had loved him;---so, I interpreted it. Shall I tell the truth? My eyes ached---filled---and my arm fell down, powerless at my side—the pistol went off —a shriek followed—and the apparition of my brother stood before me. Helen appeared, for a moment; but, rebuked, I suppose, by some gesture of Molton, for no sound escaped him, she vanished again. I only remember her, as I do all the rest---like phantoms, that came and went, in noise and smoke, while the sound of the pistol was still ringing in my ears; and I knew not that my aim at Molton's heart had been abandoned. I regarded myself as a murderer. He sat without motion. My brother stood before me. I dared not embrace him; his countenance was stern, and I began to think, though it was broad day light, that I was dreaming---nay, perhaps I am dreaming, yet!-----It is incredible that so much should have happened in so short a time. There is my watch---and the hands would tell me---but they lie---yes, they lie---that, not two hours ago, I had no blood upon my conscience. Well Frank was there. It was Frank. Whence did he come? Did he drop from the clouds? Molton's hand dropped;—he fainted:—but scarcely were his eyes shut, than he opened them again—and ordered the door to be shut, and locked. “Young men,” said he, “hear me. I have but a few words to speak. You have deliberately sought my life. I have known this, for weeks. There has not been a day, when your own was not at my mercy. You might have put me upon retaliation. Nay—you have—I speak to both—to you, sir, and to you—you have said things to me, which, the bare possibility that I am an innocent and injured man, ought to have prevented you from saying. Permit yourselves but to suppose it possible, for one moment, that you have been deceived; and what must you think of your own conduct? You have pursued me, to my own house. You have waylaid my path. You have compelled me to become a prisoner, in my own mansion, that I might not have my blood upon your hands; nor yours upon mine. How many more there may be of you, I know not. But—I hope your aim is accomplished. If it be not, my patience is exhausted. I can go no further. In my day of passion, I did many things that I would avoid now. And, if I survive this, I shall apply to the law. Will you inform me, who is the other that has haunted me so long?—lurking about my ground—in this country, too—like one prowling for a victim? You are silent. Are you ashamed?” “I know of none,” said my brother, humbly. “Nor I—I know nothing of the matter,” said I. “What!—Is the young ruffian, and his fellow, who were seen skulking about, here, some months ago, unknown to you, sir. A tall young man—a drab coat—and very erect, proud step—” “I met such a man.” said I, “this morning, in the wood.” (For I remember that he turned, suddenly, as my horse dashed past him; and put his hand into his bosom, like one surprised, where he ought not to be. Nay, I thought that he looked alarmed—but I attributed that, afterward, I remember, to my own agitated appearance; and to the pistols, wrapped in my handkerchief, to be sure, that I carried under my arm.) “I knew one suiting such a description, once,” said my brother, haughtily—“and I am glad to hear that he is so near to me. I did not know it, before.” I looked at him as he spoke. His voice was altered, and there was a cold, bright meaning, in his dark eyes. I knew not what to think. “Well,” continued Molton, “you may marvel why I have shown such forbearance toward you. That I have, and that each may know, from the other, how I have treated him, I will give you an opportunity of conversing together, after one or two short remarks. My strength ebbs apace. I am weaker than I thought. But, I think it is not mortal. You have, both of you, called me a coward. Did you believe it? If you did not, was it decent to say so? If you did, was it wise? Nay, was it bravely done? Would a stout heart ever battle with a coward? So much for what you have said. Now, hear me. There was a time, when, had you done, exactly what you have now done—I beg you to excuse my inarticulateness—it is not the loss of blood, but the consequence of agitation— and put yourselves as much in my power, as you have on this occasion, you should have died, each by the hand of the other. You shudder—nay, I can see a smile gathering in your faces. You do not believe me. But, hear me out. I was willing to try that, now. I kept you apart. One of you knows that our meeting was to have been, in silence, this evening. Had I not relented, I should have made the same appointment with you—(he addressed himself to me)—and each would have met his brother.— Your shots would have been exchanged, in silence, and darkness. The signals—the hour would have been the same—each of you would have parted from me, where you now stand, and you never would have known the truth, till it was too late. Nay—” I saw it all—and Frank staggered into my arms.— “Great God,” said he, “it is true! He had well nigh done it, indeed!” I heard a strange sound at the moment; and, as I turned my eyes, I saw Molton plucking his white handkerchief, drenched with blood, from his side. It adhered closely, and ripped, as he tore it away; and he shook a little, as with pain. Many steps, and a bustle, were then heard in the landing. “I pray you, sir,” said he, to me, “if you have any mercy on me, not to permit Helen to enter here, for the present.” My brother sat down, like one utterly deprived of strength; and covered his face with his hands. I went to the landing, and saw Helen—her hair all loose—her dress disordered—clinging about the knees of an old man—the very old man, too—I knew him, at the first glance—that I saw with Frank, so long ago.— She called him—father! father! dear father! But he stood W stern, and like a judge, before her. Yet he was her father—he was!—for I saw his forehead move, at last;— and his chest heaved—oh, with such tremendous emotion—I thought that his soul was departing, erect, from her habitation. But, the tears came, at last, and he fell upon his child's neck, and sobbed, as though his old heart would break. “Oh, my lost, lost babe!”—said the old man. I had left the door open. I heard a noise. I turned. There was my brother; and Molton, with his hand upon his side, leaning against the door frame;—his troubled eyes rivetted, with a look of strange inquietude, upon the scene. “What is the meaning of this?” he said, at last, in a voice scarcely louder than a whisper. But Helen heard him. Ears that love, are quick and jealous. They will have nothing of the musick, that they love, lost. “It is my father!” said she—rising, and throwing herself upon the bosom of Molton. He caught her in his arms. I trembled for the consequence; but the handkerchief clung to the wound, and his gown covered it. The old man arose—came forward, with a firm step; exchanged a look with Frank, and would have taken something from his bosom; but Frank arrested his arm. (“He is a dead man, already,” said Frank.) But he came forward, nevertheless, and was about to lay his hand upon Helen—when the intrepid, cold eye of Molton lightened outright—“By the living God!” he cried, “if —nay, I am too rash, perhaps—art thou, indeed her father? Helen, look up, love,—is he thy father?” “He is!” cried Helen, kneeling, and kissing his feet, while her dark tresses swept over them, in her agony— “O, forgive me! Edward. He is my father.” “I do!—I do!” answered Molton—raising her, and staggering. The father stood there—not a limb trembled. Daughter!” cried the old man—“hear me. Lift up thy hands. Renounce thy destroyer, forever—renounce him, there—there, where thou standest, before these witnesses; and thy father's heart is open to thee from this moment! I know his power—I will forgive thee!—bless thee!— weep over thee!—forget thy shame, and thy dishonour!— to thee!—if thou wilt. But—but—daughter—I will never pronounce thy name, again; no human being knows it, yet—none shall know it—daughter!—if thou wilt not, here, where I stand—here, before the same witnesses, will I curse thee!” Helen only clung the more vehemently to Molton; and buried her face the deeper in his bosom. “Daughter!—wife!—a father's and a mother's curse!— a husband's curse!—a—” She raised her face—Lord! how altered it was! “Hush! hush!” said she. “Do not believe him, Edward—do not. Father! there is my husband!” “He!—he thy husband!—then what art thou?” cried the old man. Molton's countenance, then, was like one falling asleep. Death was upon him. He gradually sank upon the sofa; and Helen stood over him, kissing his forehead—wiping the sweat from his lips—and answering their occasional movement;—for no sound escaped them—as if she understood it all—as if her very heart had a language of its own, and kept uttering it, inwardly—with a continual whisper of “oh, do not—do not believe it, Edward!” But he gained more strength. His spirit awoke, for a moment. She was putting back his hair. “Helen!” said he—his eyes were rivetted on her with such a look!—O, of unutterable tenderness, struggling with death. “Helen! look at me. I never doubted thee. Yet—here is thy father. Is there a husband, too? Look me in the face, Helen.” “A husband!” said the stern father—“Yes! What mockery is this?” “Silence!” said Molton. “I ask her. Helen! love, look upon me. I do not doubt thee, yet. Just whisper it—let thy sweet lips move, and I'll believe them, say what they will—nay, though thy husband stand before me, at the time.” “Stand before thee!—thou terrible man! By heaven, he shall stand before thee. Orford! Orford! I say.” At this name, I saw Helen shudder. She arose, and stood, fronting the broad stair case. I heard a step. The “young and interesting stranger,” appeared. “Behold him there!” cried the father. Molton turned—but when he saw his face, weak as he was, he half arose from his seat, with a look of inconceivable horrour and alarm. A convulsive motion of the hand followed—like one grasping a dagger, and ready to give a blow—and then he smiled—smiled so beautifully, so like a dying christian—that I could have fallen down, too, and wept upon his feet, and wiped them with my hair. “Young man,” he said, “I am glad of this assurance. Our feud, I feared, was mortal. Let us forget it.” He proffered his hand, as he said this; but Orford struck it away, with scorn. Molton's forehead reddened; a short, but fierce, bright struggle, followed; and, he then added, in a low, sweet, solemn voice—“Men, bear witness for me. I have offered my hand, as a dying man—nay, Helen, forgive me; something has happened more than thou knowest of, yet; do not look at me, in that manner—I have offered it to one, that insulted and abused that woman, Helen—to one, that would have taken her from me, when I was her husband—Nay, sir---or, if your name be Orford---hear me, for one little moment;—a man that would scourge a woman---attempt to ravish a wife from her lord---would be not the least likely to reject, with scorn, the hand of a dying man.” Some movement of the stranger's arm, was here intercepted by Frank, and the report of a small pocket pistol followed, close at my ear. “What, sirs!” cried Molton, “have you no decency? By heaven, I have fellows that would grind your bones to dust, were I but to speak the word!---and yet, at every turn, I am in danger of assassination. What! ho! Pedro! Cadiz! Marco!—” Instantly, we were surrounded with six or eitht of his young Spanish negroes. “Boys! Throw the first man out of the window, that you see move his arm,” said he, coldly; but with the aspect of mortal determination. They stood ready to obey. “As for you, sir---Orford, as you are called---I have little doubt that you are a coward. Beware! Nothing can save you, if you advance a finger. Your conduct, on two occasions, within my own knowledge, justifies this opinion. But, you know him well, Helen. Will you not bear witness to his gentleness---his humanity---his courage? Why so silent, love? Nay, be not cast down. These are friends. I am glad to see the young man alive; not that he deserves to live; but, I would'nt have such blood upon my conscience. It were fitter for the executioner. Speak, love. Shame the wretch, at once! Shame him to everlasting silence! Show him thy beautiful arms, scarred and bruised---the places where the iron rusted into thy flesh---the—Helen, what ails thee? Why avoidest thou mine eye? Is there any mystery in this? Speak! I never saw thee thus, before. Speak! I conjure thee! Yet stay—a thought —a—no, no---I will not imagine it. I'll only remember, dear, that—come nearer, love, nearer—nay, sir, beware how you move—it will be the signal of your death —I mention it for your sake—tell me, dear. Something was said, but now, about some other husband; some other than me—you see that I smile, Helen; but, while I remember it, it were as well, I think, to smile with me— do smile, Helen, do—I do not trouble thee to say no;— but smile, dear, smile once, as I have seen thee, when not a thousandth part so idly slandered.—Tears!—silence!—Helen, beware!—The eye of the Everlasting God is upon thee!—Nay, nay---do not press thyself to me---do not---thou must answer me! Answer me, now! I will take nothing, but thy word. Arise, and answer me! Thou knowest me.” Helen fainted. And Molton---just saying to the blacks, in Spanish, Let them go free---plucked the handkerchief from the wound, and fell back, saying faintly—“Then am I, indeed, O Saviour of men, what I most dreaded— an adulterer!” W 2 Justly afraid of the consequences, I persuaded Frank and the father to go, till we knew the result; but the husband would not depart, till the sight of Molton's shoes, full of blood, made him think, I suppose, that the wound had been given by his hand. I took advantage of the thought, and offered him my horse; and he is gone. Yes, he is an adulterer! But, what am I to think? You did not know of her marriage; nay, you did not even know, that he was the suspected one;---or that he came in the vessel with her. Was the secret so well kept in England? But how could he have been so deceived? O, he must have known it. This tale is all a farce—a farce, between life and death! No, that cannot be. Men become serious, then;—and such men, who are habitually serious and contemplative, they would not be very likely to play such pranks. But, perhaps, the wound—Ha!—you know him, Sarah—you have called him a “consummate actor.” May not all this be an artifice. It is---it must be. At least, if he be not seriously wounded, it must be. But how shall we know that? I'll go myself. O, the thought is refreshing!—look at my hands, Sarah!---look; the blood has gone from them, with the thought---and the paper, too---O, it is all white again, as the driven snow! Ha! Frank is here. Well—Frank has just left me. My suspicions are, again, at rest;---and my terrours revive. Molton has sent for me. That shows no desire of concealment, certainly. What, if I have wronged him?—ah!---ah!---it will kill me. And you, Sarah---but for you, perhaps--- Nay, I cannot blame you, for you taught me to avoid him. Frank says, that he has been here, for ten days, concealed; that he saw Molton three days ago, and agreed to meet him, on notice; that the notice was given him this morning, while I was there, no doubt; and that he was on the spot---the study---preparatory for the evening ---when, hearing my voice, which he did not expect, he stepped into the next room; that the sound of the pistol, and the shrick, alarmed him; and he entered, supposing, till now, that I had deliberately shot Molton. I now remember the heroick conduct of that man. All the while that we were together, not a look, not a word, escaped him, to charge me with unfairness. He retained his pistol.--- Poor Molton. Yes, I must see him. The father, it appears, has relented somewhat toward him. He begins to believe it possible, that there was no such deliberate seduction, as he, at first, supposed. Nay, since he finds that, from the first, Molton used no disguise in his name, for he has a letter from him, signed “Edward Molton,” he begins to think it possible, that he was deceived; for Helen had not been married one hour, when she escaped. The father prevented the publication; and, believing Molton's name fictitious, he never trusted it to any person in America; but always spoke of his daughter, and pursued her, as unmarried. Nay, when the thought came to him, that Molton might be innocent of the greater evil, he actually wept. My brother, then, ventured to tell what he knew, and what he had seen. The father shuddered. “The story of the guardian, is false,” said he. “She had no other guardian than myself, her natural father. But, there is a frightful mystery in the matter, which I cannot explain, yet. I cannot.” Farewell!---farewell. If Molton should die, I shall never sleep again. Nay, why should I wish to sleep?--- It will only be to hear the report of the pistol—it is ringing in my ears yet---to see the dark blood, swimming--- oozing—pattering, like heavy rain—O, it is horrible —good night!— Frank would have made no use of the bundle, he says; the “charm.” He came to fight him. Adieu. JOHN OMAR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JANE TO CLARA P—. I shall be with you to-morrow, “matronised,” as we of the ton say now, by Miss Matilda, my sweet maiden aunt. Prepare yourself for the wonder—here has been the devil to pay. I have just come to the truth of the whole story. All the town is ringing with it—but you may depend upon it, my way. Molton's girl is only his wife. She is also another man's wife; another man—I shall make it very intelligible, I see plainly!—has come after her—just as I have expected, always, you know; it being just the wickedest way of accounting for appearances; and I knew enough of Ned Molton to feel pretty sure that that was the true way. So it proves. Well—the husband shot Molton—and Miss Helen, “the wife of two husbands,” has gone into fits, I take it, according to form; and the husband has runaway with Mr. John Omar's beautiful horse! If that won't be a consolation to him— unless he's caught—for the loss of any wife, he must be quite a remarkable creature among the race of modern husbands. But there is something more. Her father is come. They have been here too, skulking about Philadelphia, to the knowledge of the Mayor, for a whole age. Beside, it is said that they mean to mob Molton.— They'd better not—sick or dead, he will give them a hot reception. His house is full, from garret to cellar, with black Patagonians, creatures that he has caught somewhere in South America; they can't speak a word of English, and have no other notion of duty, than to do just what he bids them. That they would cut any body's throat at his bidding, there is no doubt; and how can you punish him, in such a case? They cannot tell tales—no more than so many brutes. Is'nt he a precious fellow— that Molton? What a pretty chap for a novel, if he only lived in Italy, or any where but in America, “the land of the free and the home of the brave”—ahem!—I should like to see a little more of both, and hear less of it. Who would believe that such things were perpetrated, directly under our noses, in the nineteenth century, (I believe 'tis the nineteenth) in this, our peaceable county. Is'nt it enough to make one's hair stiffen with affright! I declare my bed shakes under me, sometimes, when I think of what we are coming to. We are getting as bad as the English. Murders are things of every day occurrence, here, since the war. Our ears were made familiar, it would seem, with it then—and that, and the wars of Europe, have deluged us with all the banditti and ruffians of the world. Another thing—there was the father, the husband, Frank Omar, and John Omar; all agreed to “have a crack at him,” as they express it here—so he could not escape you know. But the privilege of being first shot at, was yielded (without much dispute I dare say) to the husband. Lord!—what cattle they are. So, if Ned should get well now, he must fall in the long run, or begin a long run, directly, and never come back again. O—Juliet is to be married. Circulate the report; but don't say from whom you get it, till it is necessary, to make it go down. By that time, they will forget of whom they had it—and all will be well. I want her ears to get accustomed to that;—and then you may give his name. It is Grenville. I'll tell you all about him, to-morrow; and give you a specimen of his conversation, literally.— It is one continual episode. Thus, he began the other evening to speak of machinery. He began with Arkwrights; he went on with ear-rings; watches; card machines; printing presses; but let me follow him, in his own way, from Harper's Ferry to the planet Jupiter, which was quite a natural digression for him. They compare him (in derision, I suppose,) to John Randolph. But one difference is plain enough to me, already. Randolph has been known to get back, sometimes, to the point whence he started;—nay, always, I may say, in argument. But Grenville never, in any case, whatever;—every step is a point—and every point—a centre to which he never returns. One might trace his course on a map, by a Congreve rocket, that should have the faculty of exploding, whenever it struck the ground—or the subject—and then darting off again, in a tangent. He seems to have great constitutional vivacity, although his faculties, and his senses too, are fettered by this new influence, till he looks, at her side, like Apathy listening to mysterious symphonies, “coming out of the grass,” with odour and beauty—all about him—ha!—what think you of that? Some one happened to name the name of General Harper—we were speaking of his fine talent and heart;—and then, of the strange fact, that he was permitted to review the British troops, in the face and eyes of Lord Wellington. “O, speaking of General Harper,” said Mr. Grenville, “that reminds me of Harper's Ferry—ever there?--I was —always mention it—travelling for pleasure—went to the armoury—some notion of being comfortable—thought it was about time to begin to think about getting married—after a wife—know of any? Manage to make the pot boil, may be. Jefferson's rock's mighty dangerous —names carved to the brink—most curious thing—like to a'been washed away in a—hem—mill race. “Durst thou Cassius,” said I, leap with me, &amp;c.—and in I went —Lord!—it took my breath away—scarified me—whizzed and whirled me about, like soap-suds in a gutter. I would'nt recommend to you to bathe in a mill race (you will recollect that women only were present)— bad place to learn to swim in—ahem—the most curious thing that I saw, was a turning lathe—just invented— turns gun-stocks whole—“lock, stock and barrel”— 'Twas'nt exactly the wisest thing that ever was done, I confess;—I might have been drowned—but I never lose my presence of mind, at such moments, I mean—nay, women themselves do not—there was an iron mould made in the shape of a gun-stock—upon this, a number of instruments were graduated; corresponding exactly with others, above—ahem—those at the top had edges—those below had none—the wheel revolved, the chips flew, and out came a gun-stock!—ahem—wonderful contrivance— very curious indeed—revolutions are naturally in a circle —you would think it difficult to turn an oval—a hectagon—a square—but this machine does more—all at once; many ovals—capable of universal application—very simple, the principle! What a people we are! for invention, and improvement!—emphatically our national character. There's Arkwright now, and Wedgewood—you've heard of both; well—ahem—there's our Perkins, and Fairman, and Rittenhouse; and—oh, it is amusing—when the patentee of the machine to make cards—did you ever see it? One twist o' the wheel---wire crooked---cut---holes punched---teeth placed---just like the human fingers--- more exact---when a committee of the national institute were invited to see it, in Paris, they laughed at the specification—they said it was impossible—they saw it. And they say that there is nothing like it, under heaven. General Harper, they say, is the best parads officer in the world. Nay, those who know him best, say that his military talent is his predominant talent,--- a profound statesman---a great orator---poh!---a first rate lawyer---but a greater general---ahem---strange how we follow their nobility. Did you ever know Miss —, Miss, that was---or Miss —. I've heard that she said she would prefer being the Mistress of a prince, to the wife of an American citizen!---shame on her!---reproach to the country---no true American citizen, after that speech, would marry her, if she could pave his house with gold---ahem---never mind---she may live to be the mistress, yet, of Lord Wellington, or some other spoilt Irishman. Thank you for another song, Miss July—ahem—an Irishman's a prince—till he be spoilt by a peerage—Curran—Sheridan—Swift, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.---hey? Strange things are whispered of some American ladies---they had better stay where they are---we are not made for train bearers; our ladies, I mean---let us dance as we will, and prattle ever so innocently, and ask ever so many, sweet, pretty, simple questions---`Grand-pa---is I got a gizzard.' His family plate is pawned---jewels---a constellation.--- Oh---a new planet is discovered---and we are to have war with Spain---a broad belt encompasses it;---and they say there are two or three moons. I wonder if there are many lunaticks, or lovers---synonimous, you know--- there---in proportion to the number of moons—I— I—I”—. There, dear, that is a fair specimen of his trumpery, I leave you to judge of the man. But circulate the report. Leave the rest to me. JANE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET, (Enclosed in the following, from Dr. George Wallace.) Salem. Mr. Ramsay died last evening, between ten and eleven, with little pain, and in the full possession of his faculties. His daughter is seriously indisposed; but she has the best medical attention in the country; and her deportment toward her father, during his short illness, has made her many friends. Be assured, madam, that she shall want for nothing. She wrote a note yesterday morning, and gave it to me, with your address, requesting me, if the event should be as we anticipated, to enclose it to you. She took to her bed, immediately; or rather, we carried her, by force, from the presence of her father, who commanded it; and she is now delirious. Mr. Ramsay received every attention and kindness, that he could have received at home. A catholick clergyman, from Boston, one of the most amiable and benevolent of men, was with him all the time, during the last two days; and no human being ever manifested more resignation, after he was told that death was inevitable. At first, he was a good deal agitated; yet, he told me, not an hour afterward, that he knew he should die in my house, the first night that he slept here. I laughed at the notion then, but it was verified. He did die, in the very room, in the very bed, and at the very hour which he had foretold. I have had some experience in these things; and am willing to attribute much to the imagination; but, when I see a sober, sensible man, like him, yielding up to a belief that he has seen a spirit---pardon me, madam, I am little inclined to provoke a smile at such a moment; but, Mr. Ramsay, not an hour before his death, told me, that his wife had appeared to him, and summoned him. Was there any thing remarkable in her death? I ask the question, from some mysterious observations that I heard escape him, in conversation with his daughter, respecting the matter, when he was first taken ill. He told his physicians and me, that nothing could save him; but, desired us not to inform her. We tried all that we could, to divert his mind from meditating on the subject. But all in vain. Even medicine had no effect upon him. Can the mind counteract such things?—neutralize our poisons—dilute and dissipate the most corrosive, and fiery applications?— Is that sympathy so vital, that the blood cannot be chilled, where the mind is preternaturally heated? It was, in his case. Blisters were applied. They came off, as they went on. His skin had lost its sensibility. Purges and emeticks were given. No effect was produced. The stomach and bowels were impenetrable. Laudanum followed; but, the only result was, a more mortal coldness in the extremities; no sluggishness, no torpor;— the blood, therefore, was beyond our dominion. It is considered here, the most extraordinary case, within our experience; but we are told that such things may be, in the books; and our limited observation would seem to confirm the position.

I am, respectfully, dear madam, Your most obedient, humble servant, GEORGE WALLACE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(NOTE, ENCLOSED.) O, Juliet—if it should come to pass—if he should be taken from me, what will become of me? Juliet, dear, blessed Juliet—I cannot leave him, even to write this— every breath that he draws, goes to my heart—O, it is a judgment upon me. I have forgotten to pray—forgotten to—nay, what have I not forgotten—what was left to me, after I forgot my Maker—. O, Father of mercies, Father! spare him!—O, spare him!—. I must go to the bed side—he moves—farewell—if you receive this, you will understand it. The word death, may not be in it—but Death will be the bearer—.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">X MAD. VERNON TO JULIET. My sweet child.— Your letter found me so ill, that it was thought inexpedient to open it; and, when was I well enough to read it, it was not to be found; nor, did any of us conjecture from whom it came. I had left no direction for opening it; and, as you had not written to me, for so long a time, it never occurred to me, that my dear Juliet was the writer. But, to-day, we have found it, unopened, carefully put away, with some old papers, of no value. I tore it open, and read it, with feelings, I am sure, that my poor patient child, would not willingly cause her mother; let me be still your mother, Juliet, the endearing name—O, it is tender and welcome to my widowed, childless heart;—yet, dear, why should I complain of it? The tears that followed, and blinded my old eyes, were tears of pleasure, as well as bitterness. To find my babe restored to health, again, O, that were enough to make me endure any thing. But Juliet, tell me the whole truth, dear—all thy suffering. No—I am wrong—do not. O, my heavenly Father, why should we repine, aged, and weary, and worthless as we are, when we see the innocent and lovely; the pure of heart, and the very beautiful, so helpless and miserable! Juliet, what can I do for thee. Shall I weep?—behold my tears; my glasses are dim with them, and the paper is blistered—my prayers?—O, while I lock my withered hands, and pray for thee, mayest thou feel the warmth of His love, flowing into thy dear heart, as it does into mine, old as it is, whenever I prostrate myself, devoutly, before him. Let that prayer be granted; and thou hast nothing more to wish. Thou wilt be happy. O, dear Juliet, when a poor, lone, dark woman, like me; beset, as I am; bereaved as I have been, can find that a consolation, for the loss of husband, children, friends, youth, riches, and health, in widowhood, and childlessness, O, believe that there is a divinity in religion---a truth, in that blessed Book, upon which my hand is now lying---believe it, and thou wilt be happy, happen what will. Yet, thy calamities are not light; not light; I well know that, Juliet. Thy uncomplaining, quiet disposition, never speaks, while it has a tear left; and when thy tears, poor, gentle heart, are all shed, when they are exhausted, hard must have been the pressure. O, I do pity thee—I do, from my soul, my dear child. But look up to Him—pray to Him, unceasingly. He will interfere for thee. Hath He promised it, and shall He not do it? What shall I say of Grenville? What I know of him, is entirely in his favour. He wants dignity, I confess; and, most of all, that intellectual dignity, which— nay, my dear child—let us abandon all such thought;— and once more, only once more, will I mention him. It is now.—I am amazed at his blackness. I knew that he was rash, and a creature of violent passions;---but I thought that he had arrived at their mastery. He had given such proof. I know that he has been great---resisted greatly—their dominion. And has he yielded at last? O, my child, forgive me, forgive me for the danger that my counsels have led thee into. I did not think him faultless, as I told thee; nay, for he told thee himself, that he had great faults, which he would overcome. How has he kept his promise? Let him answer that. Farewell, my dear, dear Juliet. Do not be hasty. I give no more advice. I have done recommending anybody to thee; judge for thyself. But conceal thy sentiments, even from me. I am sore yet, with my partiality---so infirm are we all! But Mr. G's family are respectable; and, so far as I know any thing of him, his life is irreproachable. I say this, I hardly know why---is it because I would not have a man seen in the company of Juliet R. Gracie, who was not a man, and a christian? Whether Mr. G. be one or not, you can judge, better than report. Farewell,— N. V.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Frank has prevailed. We could not both fly to the sick bed of our beloved Sarah; and we have finally agreed that he should be, as the older, and more experienced, the first to minister consolation to her who, henceforth, is our sister. From this instant, our home is your home, Sarah, and while we have a morsel of bread, that morsel is yours. We mention this now, because, it may happen in these disastrous times, that a death so sudden, as that of your excellent father, may leave his extensive affairs in some disorder; or, at least, render it difficult to bring them to a profitable or speedy termination. I speak now as a man of business. Sudden death, in the head of a great commercial house, is little better than a bankruptcy, unless the property be under lock and key. I pray you, therefore, my dear Sarah, to be prepared for the worst. Put the whole management of the business into the hands of Frank; and make yourself well and happy, as soon as possible. This will not be shown to you, till the agony of your bereavement is passed; but, it will be shown you, while the greater danger is yet near you; that of despondency, and weariness of spirit. I recommend travelling to you; Frank will accompany you. I offer no consolation. I pretend not to the power. But I feel for you. I have wept for you; and I can only say, go to the blessed Book, which you have so often recommended to me.—I do not pretend to speak from my own knowledge of its value from my own experience, I mean—I am shamefully ignorant of it, I confess—but, I see that it makes the mourner look smilingly up to heaven; the widow's heart beat; and the sweet orphan move her little mouth in prayer;---and I cannot doubt, that it is the best medicine for the sick at heart—for you, my own dear Sarah.—Do not yield to the blow. But you will not. Your talents are not to lie idle and darkening, in the chamber of apathy. No— you must be useful to them that want examples among the sweetest charities of life—the household charities. Poor Juliet is indisposed, but sends her love—will write soon. Affectionately, and ever yours, dear cousin and sister. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO JOHN. Salem, — Dear John.—I found our dear cousin far gone, indeed. She was so altered that I scarcely knew her; and, when I first took her hand, she did not seem to know me; and it trembled, as if there were something hateful in the touch of mine; but, after looking me steadily in the face, —her dark hazel eyes, burning to their centre, with some deep, strange thought, for two or three minutes,—she heaved a deep sigh, smiled faintly, shut her lips—and the tears instantly filled her eyes. She pressed my hand—and carried it to her temples. The beating was excessive and fiery. I spoke to her—I endeavoured to appear undisturbed; but she saw my agitation; and I am sure that she ran over, in her thought, all that had happened to both, since we parted. She attempted, two or three times, to speak; but her heart was too full, and she only put her beautiful hand upon her bosom, and temples, and shook her head. After that, she slept for several hours; and her nurse told me, with more composure, than at any time since her illness. She had been in danger, I was assured, by the worthy, but very eccentrick old gentleman, whom I apprehend to be a correspondent of Juliet's; for he spoke of “Madame Gracie.” You may be very sure that I smiled, at the whimsical association in my mind. But the danger is all passed now; and, at our last conversation, there was discoverable a deep and beautiful inwardness of tranquillity, that augurs well. We have spoken of Juliet; and she desires to be remembered to her, with affection and gratitude; “gratitude,” she says, with emphasis, “Juliet will know what I mean.” Tell her that her advice was timely. I was in more danger than I dreamt of. But her letter and this shock have opened my eyes; and I do trust, if it be permitted to me, to go abroad once more, that I shall have the strength to prove how I have been bettered and benefited by both. “A fall makes one step more carefully.” she added; “and every aberration from the true path, is remembered, in the sick chamber, as an X 2 irregular pulsation of the heart—something to be cured at once—something to turn pale at.” Farewell. Be particular about her, and believe me, as I am. FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK. I have been with Molton every hour, night and day, since you left us. He is yet in a very critical way; but whence, if it be not from the sustaining power of a well governed mind, and a conscience untroubled and unpolluted, can be preserve this great serenity, at such a time? I know not what to think of him. I have spoken of his past life; and he has acknowledged that his conscience is not clear; that there is a heaviness about his heart, and a darkness upon his understanding, at times, from the recollection of much evil that he hath caused and done. Yet, he says, that there is not the weight of one deliberately cruel, or wicked deed, upon his memory. It was impossible not to believe him. His sins have been those of suddenness, or of mistaken, but generous, imprudence. His passions have been tremendous;—but they are now, one would believe, utterly subjected to his mastery. There was a consultation, last night; and the result would have been unknown, had not Molton demanded, in a tone of solemn authority, that they should not deceive him. “How dare you trifle with a dying man?” said he. “Am I in a very perilous situation? Speak! Tell me so, like men. I shall bear it like a man. Do you fear for the agitation? You little know me. Were you to tell me this moment, that I should be a dead man, when that hand points at twelve, you would perceive no change in my countenance; none in my voice; none in my pulse.— What! should I not feel it? I should. But the spasm would be over, instantly. There would be no outward sign. Do your duty. Tell me the truth. What is my chance of life? Have I one in ten, one in a hundred, or a thousand?—What! no answer! is my death so certain, as that—not one chance in a thousand! You shake your heads. Speak, will you? You are not dealing with a child. Tell me my fate, at once, and let me go to sleep. I am weary of this anxiety. Would you have me bear witness against you, to-morrow or next day, for deception —before God.” They refused to declare their opinion; but entreated him not to disquiet himself. He smiled; and, looking at me, calmly observed, “you see now the efficacy of that rule. Were I not accustomed to the contemplation of death, his nonsense alone, would be enough to jar me to dissolution. What! am I such a simpleton, as not to know that, when doctors and surgeons consult together, by their own consent, the case must be extremely critical; and that, when a consultation has once been held, if they have anything pleasant to communicate, any hope, any chance, however small, it is always told? No, Mr. Omar,—I know the truth. The terrible pains that I had felt this morning; the sudden cessation of those pains have told me the truth. A mortification has begun.— Very well. I expected it. The inflammation justified me in expecting it. Let them be as silent as they will, were I a weaker man than I am, it would be a dastardly policy. Would not any patient conclude that such silence as this, was the doom of death, most emphatically pronounced, by them, from whom there is no appeal? Well, gentlemen,—since you are unwilling to tell me that I am a dead man, will you allow me to ask you, how long it is possible for me to be a living one?” They were earnestly whispering together at the window.— The elder advanced, and took his hand. “Are you prepared for the worst?” said he. “Yes, for the worst,” said Molton. “Will you submit yourself entirely to us?”— “Entirely. Do with me as you will, while the breath is in me—and then, you are welcome to my bones—and all, but my heart. That were a study that would terrify you. Nay—on second thought, I recal that. You shall not have my body. I have reasons for it.” The medical man shook his serene old head, as if he suspected, that all was not right. “We have concluded to tell you the result,” said he. “There is yet some hope.” Molton's countenance fell.—What! was life appalling to him.— “But the chance is small, indeed. We shall abandon the ball; but a very painful operation is indispensible, or your hope is truly desperate.”—Molton looked him steadily in the face. “Spoken like a man!” said he. “That is right. That is the way that wise men will act, when dealing with creatures, about to appear before the judgment seat against them.—Do with me as you will.” The operation was then performed. It was frightful, and he fainted—the blood spun out of his breast;—his hair was wet and soaked in his own sweat; yet he never breathed a loud word. He is better now. “Are you willing to die?” said I. He was silent—I repeated it. “No” he replied, “No!--No man is willing to die, if, by that, you mean, that he would not save himself, if he could.”— “Are you resigned?”—“I do not understand the word,” said he, “but I am proud, too proud, to flinch—and, when I reflect on what I must endure, if I recover, I declare to you, that I am more intimidated at the sudden thought of life, than death. The pain of death is nothing. I have suffered more than that twenty times over; nay, I have been dead, to all appearances, more than once. The coming to, was death. It was like the rush of a whirlwind of powdered glass into my lungs—my arteries were distended—all the vessels of my heart were ruptured; and I could have raised my hands, and wept, to be left alone; but I had not the power. My mind only moved—my body was at their mercy; and they tortured it back to life. No—I should be sorry to die; but, if I must die, there is no martyr of them all, that ever died, more self collected, passionless and undisturbed, than Edward Molton will. The time has been, when death was terrible to me. The career of ambition was then open to me. The blood beat into my heart like a tide; and a mighty spirit arose, self-engendered, self-created, self-compounded, in the uproar and agitation of its elements—the fierce alchymy of fire and blood—a spirit, that would have died, with the harness upon its back, though it died, scaling the bastions of heaven. Woman was accessible to me then. I was born to love—and be beloved. Then, life was dear to me! It is so no longer. My ambition is extinct. My love has burnt down. My heart is in cinders. Now, why would I live?—Faith, it were difficult to tell.—Perhaps to be a better man--- perhaps, to be revenged on some, that have thought evil of me;---perhaps, to prove to them, when their faces are in the dust, and my foot is upon their neck, that---I never asked more, than to have my power acknowledged. Acknowledge it, and I will never use it. Deny it---and what follows? I must thunder about your ears with the proof. Behold the secret of my disposition—the whole secret of my crimes.” What am I to think of such a man? and then, his wife— O Frank! to be so loved; so worshipped; so ministered to, by a creature like that; Ah, I should go distracted at the thought of losing her. By the way—I must not forget, that the father is unaccountably kind to Molton, now—and that his manner toward him, is rather that of one, who has injured another, than been injured by him. His look too, is “more in sorrow, than in anger.” I cannot understand it; yet so it is; and I have actually caught the old man weeping upon Molton's hand, with Helen by, her beautiful eyes upturned, in her idolatry to her lord's—when I entered unexpectedly; and I have paused—and wished that I had put off my shoes—for the ground that I trod upon, I felt, was holy. O—You are held pledged to secrecy for all, that transpired, while you were present. I have promised it, so that these reports may all die away, now that the husband has gone. May not this marriage have been the secret that changed Juliet? Mention it to Sarah. Nay, I have some notion that, that was what he communicated to her, when I left them alone, for a moment. I am afraid of the consequences. I don't like this Grenville, yet he appears to be on a very familiar footing there; and, what is exceedingly provoking, although I have taken a great deal of pains, I have been unable to hear one word against him. The whole world seemed to be leagued against me. I am very serious; for, though, if she marry him, I should most devoutly pray that he be a good and great man; yet I have my fears of both.— But fears are not enough;—if my brother, my noble hearted brother is to be supplanted by anybody, it should be by a man.—Nay, I should not be much pleased by the comparison. But what can she do? There never were such a set of children and gawkies, with their impudent familiarity too—about any woman of sense, since the world was made. I wonder if they have the assurance to believe that they understand her value. The devil take them!—there is not one among the whole, that can fathom her heart, or her understanding. All that they know, is, that she is gentle and sweet tempered, and sings well; and that two or three fine fellows have been in love with her. But this Mr. Greenville—he has more sense— not much to be sure, for he does not, cannot know her. His compliments are often direct and barbarous; and, did I not know that he is a man of property, his pretensions to it, and his indirect, ingenious way of boasting of his wealth; and announcing his desire of obtaining a wife, would make me tuck away my watch chain, if I sat near him. His fondness too, is childish at times. But after all—I am obliged to own that I think Juliet likes him.— If so—persecuted as she is—helpless as she is, with Jane and Matilda about her—her pride and soreness—God help her! Farewell. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. I have written to Frank, a long letter, dear Sarah; and meant to have written another to you; but I am really unable. My strength is nearly exhausted. I had no idea of it, till now; but the loss of sleep, I find, wears more, upon my constitution, than the loss of food,---or even than the troubles of the mind. You can read Frank's letter, however, and consider it the same, as if written to you; for I hardly know what else I could have said; except to praise heaven, from the bottom of my heart, that you have escaped a protracted illness; and to pray your implicit submission to Frank's guidance, in every particular, just as if he were your own brother. Oh, yes—there is yet another thing; but that is for you alone. Keep your eye upon Juliet. I have my fears, that she is more unhappy than she would seem; that there is some deep grief, praying inwardly upon her, I am sure. She deceives herself;---she deceives the world. But she cannot deceive me. My tenderness is too vigilant; a secret disease is working at her heart. You may guess it;---her face is serene, her manners composed; and her spirits never appeared more truly innocent and captivating; but, at times, even in her pleasantest mood, when nobody else saw her, I have seen her; all the festivity of her eye vanished; her pale brow grow still paler; and her meek lips trembled, as if a spectre had gone by—visible to her eyes only. I suspect the truth. The world say that she never loved---till now. What!---can it be, that— no, no, I will not imagine such blasphemy. Ever thine, dear Coz. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. I have been a little unwell, my dear sister; for so, I must call you, that, if we cannot make up in nearness, we may in number, the relations that you have lost;--- but the first thing that I have attempted, as soon as I am able to hold a pen, is to write to you; not, with the vain hope of offering consolation to a daughter, in the hour of her bereavement and affliction; no, dear Sarah, but to weep with you; to kneel with you; and to pray to Him, whose mercy endureth forever, that He will have compassion on the sick and weary of heart; “that he will temper the wind to the shorn lamb,” and be to thee, my sister, my own dear sister, what he hath been to me, in my unworthiness, a present helper indeed—father!—mother! brothers and sisters! O, blessed be his name. Without his indulgent, and sustaining hand, how utterly helpless were our situation! two orphans—afar and apart—alone, in the wide world,—beset with many dangers;—one exposed to the profligate and sordid, by her wealth; the other to—all the world—by her poverty. Ah, Sarah, it were difficult to say, which was the most enviable situation; that, where the purest offerings of the heart are liable to be suspected of impurity; where, whatever may be its disinterestedness, passion and vehemence, and truth and tenderness; they can never be proved,—because the shrine of its idol is of fine gold, and rough with precious stones:—or that, where the true heart is continually pressed, and pressed; and tortured and wrung, while there is one drop of life left within it—by poverty and dependance. O, Sarah! O, my sister! how many a delicate creature, appointed by heaven to all the offices of love, and tenderness, on earth—to be a wife—and a mother—to some dear, noble hearted man, and some sweet babe,—hath been pinioned and bound, and offered up in sacrifice—either by her poverty, her pride, or her revenge. How many a maiden hath perjured herself;— how many a widow re-sold the desolate tenement of love, to the highest bidder—Ah, the thought is too cruel.— What can I say to thee? Nothing but this, my beloved sister, nothing but this—to put thy trust in heaven. JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDWARD MOLTON TO THE REV. CHARLES ASHTON. Your letter, sir, returning mine, was received, when I was unable to reply. I made you some promises in that, which, had you acted prudently, or with the good sense, to be expected from a man of your age, and profession, you would have opened, after having invited the correspondence; —and which (I speak of those promises,) I hasten to fulfil, notwithstanding the insult that you have offered me. My letter, I shall keep by me, with the seal unbroken. We may chance to meet again, here;—or, perhaps, in heaven; and, if it be permitted to me, I will then break the seal in your presence, and convict you of what I have just charged you with. I pity you. And here our correspondence must close. I only write now— because I promised to make some remarks upon Mr. Laney's book. I have performed my engagement; and written them in a sick chamber. They follow, precisely as if nothing had happened between us. I let no such things disturb me. I have been too much accustomed to them. You are not the first man, nor the first clergyman, that I have been deceived by;— no, nor the first, whom I have found a cold, calculating, shrewd man; who, if his heart were ever surprised into any one generous emotion, made haste to atone for it, by acting, as if he had no heart at all. I will tell you of one instance. There was a man of this character once, who had some notion, perhaps, that I could be of use to him. He was electioneering then for a benefice. He went to a friend of mine—a man that was my friend, and is yet—and will be, to my dying day—who had known me long enough, not to shut his eyes to the light—though that light were brought to him, in my hands;—a gentleman too, who has not the courage to insult a brave man, when he knows that his gown is a greater shelter to him, than cowardice or womanhood. He asked my friend for a letter to me. It was given, with evident reluctance; (for the applicant was a stranger, to him,) and with these remarks, “I will give it to you, sir. But you must expect no dinner—no wine;—he is too poor for either—no popularity, for he is unpopular.” Yet the man had the indelicacy to take the letter, notwithstanding—a letter that was only—not refused. He came to the town, where I was; and, when he found that, what he had heard from my friend, was true—his heart failed him. He had the meanness to keep it a secret from his own intimate friend, that he had a letter of introduction to me. He was Y ashamed to own it. Would he have owned, to his Ma ker, think you, if he could have helped it, that the same letter was obtained by his own importunity. No—yet such was the fact. I heard of his arrival. I expected to see him. On week—ten days—two weeks passed over my head—still he came not. I saw an intimate friend of his. “Mr. S—,” said he, “has a “letter for you, he tells me, from Mr. P—” he—“Ah”—said I—“a letter of introduction, I suppose.” “A letter of introduction!” said this most courteous gentleman, with a manner for which he deserved to have his teeth knocked down his throat; a favour that I should assuredly have done him, on the spot, had I not known enough of the man, to believe that he expressed no more surprise, than he honestly felt, at my having presumed such a thing—what! a letter of introduction to me!—borne by Mr. S—! The thing was quite too ridiculous! I was sensitive then. Poverty makes most men humble. It makes me proud. I scorned to tell the creature the truth;—that the letter was an introduction, and a solicited one too. “Tell your friend, sir,” said I, “to put the letter into the Post Office.” A few days after, I received it. I have it yet. Had it been presented to me by any gentleman, in the situation of the man, of whom I speak, I should have said, “sir,” I thank you for your visit. I shall not return it. But do not consider that as any mark of disrespect. At present, my acquaintance would not be creditable to you. I shall, therefore, not return your visit; but come and see me, when you can. Hereafter it will be different. The time is coming, when no man shall be ashamed of me, or of my company. I shall treat you as well as I am able, till we know each other. I do not ask you to dine with me —because the people where I board; and, to whom I pay my board, too, may have to pawn a ragged pocket-handkerchief (which they did one day) to buy bread for us; and I never drink wine.” This I would have said. But he gave me no opportunity. I felt no little bitterness toward him, at first;—but that has now passed away, and I forgive him. He did unwisely;—a little knowledge of the human heart, must have let him into the secret; that, when it is sore with the jarring of the world—quivering—cold and alone— a gentle hand will not approach it carelessly, lest, even the well-meant office of kindness, may be misinterpreted for rudeness. Still less will it, when that heart is in flower, for the first time in its solitude, for many years, will it send a bitter and deliberate blast upon it. There was a time, when I would have horse-whipped the man, whatever were the colour of his coat, who did that thing. And even since, so little of that forbearance, which I have now, had I then, that I deliberately told the story, among them that knew him; they did not appear surprised; they had never suspected him of a heart—they knew that he was full of worldly wisdom, and intrigue—prudent electioneering intrigue, at the time;—and I meant, if I ever met him in company, that would be wise enough to listen, and remember, and not interfere, to tell him the story to his teeth. But that thought, I have abandoned. An angel won me from it. She smiled upon me; and the sacrifice, almost the first, yea, it was the first, of a purpose so solemnly resolved, was made—. I forgave him—for her sake. I have now done, Mr. Harrow. Do you see the parallel? Had you read my letter, sir, you would have found a gentler spirit, it may be, than you expected; and, had you continued to think well of me, till my own lips condemned me, I could have convinced you, that all which you have lately heard, might be true; and yet, that I was not very guilty. Has your charity never imagined such a possibility? I only suggest it. I leave it to your meditation. I scorn to win any such heart back to me. Were you young, I should smile at your rashness, and forgive it; but one so old, so seemingly generous, so much above other men, in the calm of philosophy—I have no hope of such a man, when he acts like a boy. I do not respect you as I did. I no longer value your good opinion, as I have. The following remarks are for your eyes, and for Mr. Lancy's. Whether you ever see them, I care little, now. There was a time, when I would have written them over, for your eyes, alone; as I would, for those of my own father. But you are all alike, old and young—mere men; fuller of infirmity and blindness, as you verge upon the tremendous threshold of darkness and eternity. Do not misunderstand me. I have written them, only in obedience to my promise. It is no longer a pleasure for me, to write for your eyes. I shall not attempt to follow the author in the order of his reasoning; but, I will examine what he, and many others have said, upon the same subject, just as their several theories may happen to present themselves to my mind. The question is this: reduced to its elements. Whence is the pleasure, that we derive from the exhibition of tragedies?—the narration of murders?—the representation of battles, in painting and poetry?—the sight of bloodshed and horrour? Is it pleasure? If not, why do we seek it with such avidity? All agree, that it is pleasure. One man will tell you, that our pleasure is derived from a comparison of our circumstances, with those of the sufferer. He will say, “it is not sympathy, but selfishness.” Is that true? If it were, this pleasure would increase, as that difference became more striking and evident. I am in my house, by a warm fire, where I can hear the storm beat upon my roof, and the beach roar. I feel pleasure. The sense of security is delightful. But if my pleasurea rise from that sense of security;—if it be the result of a comparison between my situation, and that of those, who are exposed to the storm, the peasant, or the mariner, then would it augment, in proportion as I saw that exposure encreased. Of course, if the skies thundered all around me, while I stood safe; and all the winds, and all the waters raged; and I could see the apparition of ships, drifting in the hurricane, while my own dwelling stood unshaken, I should be the happier. Nay, let a ship drive upon the breakers, at my feet. Let me look out in safety, from the illuminated window of my strong cottage, upon the miserable, drowning creatures, below; as the difference between their situation and mine, is the cause of my pleasure, that pleasure would then be at its height. But it is not. It is not selfishness, then. It is not a sense of security. It is not a comparison of situations. “It is gratitude to heaven!” another will say; “gratitude for being sheltered and sustained, while others wander, unsupported, in the iron tempest, over the unsteady waters.” But no, it is not gratitude. For, if it were gratitude; and that gratitude arose as it must have arisen, from comparison—then, our pleasure must have been greatest, when the difference between our situation, and that of the sufferers, (or any sufferer,) was the greatest; for, then would our gratitude be at its height, together with its cause. No, it does not arise from gratitude, for the very reason that it does not arise from comparison, and a sense of the difference in our situations. “It is your consciousness of security;” repeats another. Is this true? I stand at my window, and listen to the skies, while they roll over my head, in thunder. The earth rocks under my feet. The lightnings of heaven blaze upon the ocean; I see it all white with foam, and the clouds in its bosom. Am I more secure now, than when the skies were blue, and clear; the ocean in a sweet sleep; and my dwelling in safety? Beside—at this moment of peril, I see a fellow creature, ready to perish; he is upon the very brink of the precipice—or weltering, and blinded, upon the surge.— I climb the precipice—I leap into the breakers—I save him. If my pleasure were only the sense of security, why did I relinquish it, so foolishly?—my security grew less and less, at every step. Yet, I persisted. It was not my sense of security, then. As little, was it selfishness; for that would have withheld me from the peril of humanity. Nor, was it the difference, discovered by a comparison of situations; for had it been, I acted most unwisely, by diminishing that difference, as I did, in exposing my life; and, had it been that, my pleasure would have diminished, with the difference. Y 2 “But it is your sense of danger, that thrills you;” says a third; “and the emotion is pleasurable.” Impossible; for if it were so, there would be no cowards. We should seek danger with more care, than we now avoid it. Battle would be no longer terrible to any man. But what is it, then, that gives us the deep and beautiful emotion, that we experience at such a season of peril? It is not, that we are pleased to be in danger; but, that a sense of danger wakens our spirits and faculties; puts us to thinking of our dependence, and of God's power. In a calm, blue day, we feel a sleepiness in our serenity. We do not so much feel, as breathe. We are not conscious of safety, till in danger. So, we think nothing of health, till it is about to depart from us. Do we love sickness, because our eyes are brighter in sickness? No—but we have learnt to value health, because we have but little left. So, we love safety, in proportion as it is diminished. The storm comes up, while we are reposing, half asleep, under the trees. Till there was danger, there was no safety to us; for we saw it not, felt it not. It is, therefore, the sense of security, which is one ingredient, in the beautifully compound feeling that we have at such a moment. But, as that feeling of security diminishes, and the danger becomes more alarming, we are troubled, and terrified. The mind is frightened from her contemplation. The spirit's devout breathing of gratitude is followed by supplication. She is terrified from her devotion. That we are pleased with a degree of danger, is certain. There is something warlike and agitating in what is dangerous: hence athletick sports, racing, hunting, fencing—tilt and tournament. But the moment, when that peril is so great, as to prevent our faculties from moving loftily;—the moment that the activity of thought is palsied; the lights of the imagination dimmed, by the nearness of the peril, or its magnitude, that moment our pleasure ceases. Danger is pleasant, just exactly to that point, and no further, where the chief play of the mind is produced,—or rather, the most intense excitement of some one faculty, without the prostration of the rest; and this will be endured to an inconceivable extent, where we know that it is in our own power to withdraw, when we please, from the danger. Another fact, somewhat mysterious at first, but found in analogy, with the commonest operation of the mind, is this;—that, in proportion as the quantity of our safety decreases, the value encreases. Diminish the quantity, and the quality improves. Our health is another example. Riches may be another. Few men will part from their last dollar. But many risk their last thousands every hour; and part, without emotion, from many thousands. We feel sensible of our security, and of its value, only when about to lose it. I have a friend, a wife or child, no matter which; but the blessing is inestimable. I say this. I feel it. Yet—touch that friend with sickness. Let death approach that wife. Let pestilence breathe upon the mouth of my babe. With what distracting tenderness, I now doat upon it. How different are my feelings! We only feel the chord that is tugged at. Were my pleasure the growth of security, I should be more an d more miserable as that security diminished. But I am out; and when all that is so dear to me is in delicate health, I love her but the more tenderly for it. Were this not an appointment of heaven,---in its affection, the sick bed would be deserted—the chamber of sorrow would become a hermitage;—the desolate and bereaved would be left—abandoned and alone. Thus far, I have spoken of many theories, advocated by Hume, the Abbe du Bos, Fontinelle, Campbell, &amp;c. without distinguishing them; but I may now be more particular, for a time. The Abbe du Bos contends, that such pleasures are sought, like gambling, to awaken us from ennui. It matters not what the emotion be, says he;—the stronger it is, the better. The more afflicting and disagreeable certain spectacles may be, in themselves, the more acceptable they are, because more efficient in relieving the soul from that oppression, which is so insupportable to its energies. But this, I believe, is hardly true. Beyond a certain point, such excitement becomes painful; and is avoided by the most diseased appetite. What woman, though half dead with the vapours, could see a man broken, alive, upon the wheel; or even an amputation performed, with pleasure? Fontinelle says, that pleasure and pain differ not much in their cause. Pleasure, pushed too far, becomes pain. Pain, a little moderated, becomes pleasure. Take the example of tickling. Thus, too, there is a soft and agreeable sorrow, which is only pain diluted. But, can this be true? Says another—a cramp is painful; at what time does it become agreeable? A great disappointment disturbs and grieves us—yet, who is pleased with a slight one? A great insult enrages us—at what time is an insult agreeable? Hume subverts the doctrine, while endeavouring to uphold it. He maintains, that our pleasure, at the representation of a tragedy, arises out of the aggravation of natural misery, which we see. But, if this were true, the most extravagant caricatures of misery, would be most delightful to us;—and, if it be the art of the poet, I would ask what pleasure we can receive, when that art is visible; and our pleasure arises from the aggravation of certain sufferings? If we see that they are aggravavated, are we not angry at the trick;—and if we do not, how know we, that exaggeration is the cause of our pleasure? Doctor Campbell follows them all; and, at last, gives his own, which makes the pleasure in question to consist in a certain self-complacency that we feel, in finding ourselves so kind hearted;—next, a beautiful compound, which is somewhat unintelligible to me; and then—but I have somewhat to say of my own notions, on the subject; and will leave Dr. Campbell to the author. We are more interested in terrifick and calamitous events, because of their unfrequency; and because they excite a livelier and more vehement sensibility. The scenery of a tragedy, if warlike and turbulent, is the same.— It has less the air of vulgar life, too. And sorrow impresses itself more durably upon the heart than joy.— Sorrow leads us to contemplation; suffering, and the aspect of suffering, to retirement, where its visage sinks into our heart. But joy leads us abroad—and we forget it. We laugh at farces, and forget them. We weep at tragedies; and our memory never lets go its hold upon them. Beside, pleasant skies, good health, perfect security, the drama of common life, excite no reflection; or, if any, reflections that are unfavourable to enjoyment. We see others happy; and it often obtrudes our own sorrow upon us, with more force;—others, in health, and strength, and beauty, and we feel doubly unhappy, in our weakness and deformity, as something marked out for the peculiar displeasure of heaven. Not so, at exhibitions of another character; then, we run, with avidity, over what we have to be thankful for, and delight in displaying it. In the former case, envy and discontent, are often awakened; in the latter, gratitude and submission. At tragedies, the sickness and deformities of another, remind us of our own good health, or person. The mind delights in finding and imagining parallels. Thus, bright skies, and pleasant scenery, excite painful emotions. Stormy skies, and the face of calamity, excite pleasurable emotions. The latter are remembered longest, and, consequently, give most pleasure. And the sum of my whole theory, is this. Whatever gives a brisker circulation to the animal spirits; or, to the intellectual spirits, without agitating the mind so much, that it cannot think, is pleasurable; be it danger, storm and darkness, or tragedy. It must have the faculty of exciting reflection, without disturbing us. We must be sufficiently awake to compare, without being terrified by the conclusion. And the simple definition that I would give, is this—the pleasure that we experience, is only a hurry of feeling. It is derived from the disposition that we have, in common with race horses, to keep up with whatever we see; and outrun all that we can! And, whatever excites the mind to the greatest activity, without overwhelming it, is the most pleasurable to it, for a time. But, beware how you overwork it, by repetition, or continuity. The faculties, physical and intellectual, hold too intimate a dependance, for either to be trifled with. If you will preserve the freshness of sensation, the tone of the instrument, you must keep the chords and nerves in gentle but continual exercise. I ought not to forget, however, that there is a pleasure in seeing theatrical representations, totally apart from this. What is naturally disagreeable, and even disgusting, in itself, may become beautiful, exactly in proportion as it is naturally represented. Morland's hogs, for example, wallowing in filth. So, too, a murder upon the stage may gratify us, in proportion to its faithfulness, which, if perpetrated before our eyes, in reality, would drive us distracted. Our pleasure, in these cases, it will be perceived, grows out of admiration and love for human talent, and the faculty of imitation;—and has nothing to do with a wicked or corrupt heart, or beastly imagination. I have now done, Mr. Ashton; but, as we are probably about to part, forever, I cannot say farewell—no, I cannot, in the spirit with which I began. I am near my grave. You, perhaps, are near yours; for you are an old man, Mr. Ashton, and cannot be long for this world. We may meet, sooner than we expect. What shall I say to you, then? This, and this only. “Man! I was worthy of your good opinion—here is my heart—read— there is my judge—do I tremble?” No, Mr. Ashton—I would not tremble, not before my Maker, in aught that relates to you. You have nothing to complain of. But why need I say this? It will all appear there. The sins that I have done—they are in his book. He will do justly with me; and I shall prostrate myself, that he may.— But, in that book, there will be found no sin against you. However, we are about to part. I feel no animosity, or but little, toward you. I am not sorry that you returned the letter, as you did, unopened. It has left the fame of one, that is yet dear to me, in my keeping; and there it shall be, until this heart be dust and ashes. But, why did you return my offering so unkindly? Could you not bear to be loved by me? I had no father—none;—nought but a poor, desolate mother? I went to you, with my heart, naked, in my hand—you put it back. Was it wise? Is it wise to turn such fountains as gush here, into fountains of bitterness? It is not. Old man, you have sinned. You have shaken my reverence for age. Yet, I could have forgiven it. I could have remembered our common infirmities—your liability to imposition—the generosity of your nature. Yes, I could have appealed to that—I could—but I scorned to do so. No!—you had doubted me, insulted me, and cast me off, when my vindication was in your hand. Yet—sir, I forgive you.— Farewell, forever. ED. MOLTON. Rev. Mr. Ashton, London, Eng.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARLES GRENVILLE TO HIS MOTHER. My beloved mother— After all my wandering and trial; after so many vicissitudes and disappointments; so many changes in myself, and so much caprice in others, I have at last, I think, a prospect of being happy. Yes, mother, I have, at last, found the woman, whom, I believe, fitted by heaven, for my happiness. My feelings are serious and devout. The hey-day of my boyhood is past; and I have learnt to distrust and tremble at those sudden prepossessions and prejudices, which, once, were well nigh shaking my reason to the centre. I have found the woman, at last, that I can love and reverence. One, I had seen, before, whom I could have loved, and did love, as you know; but oh, she would not permit me to respect her; she would not permit that I should enshrine her, and sanctify the place of her dwelling, as a spot unapproachable to aught of sensuality or corruption.—I found another, however, heaven forever bless her, for her goodness! whom I believed to contain within her bosom, the noblest principles, the most generous sentiments, the most devoted and sublime affection—I waited, only till her heart were in blossom, and fruitage, to offer her mine. But the vine was not for me. Others, have I seen, two others, who were lovely and estimable women; but I had not the courage to think of either, as my wife, as the head of my table;—or, as the mother of my children. They had no experience, none; and I would not trust, unthinking as I am, the everlasting happiness of my babes, to them, whose experience went scarcely so far, as the fashioning of a cap, or the plaiting of a ruffle. But, there was one—one, about whom, you felt so sensible an alarm, when we were last together, whom I could have borne to think of, in that solemn and sublime capacity—a wife and a mother.— She was trained to the office. The large family, so long subjected to her watchfulness; her character, its impressive seriousness; her sincerity, as manifested in her advice to me;—all these things were of weight; and though my situation and honour forbade me to think of her then, in any other light, than that of a friend; yet, since then, and often since her marriage, have I thought of her, as better fitted for my happiness, than any other woman, whom I ever met. But, I have found another; and, as I cannot bear that an emotion of my heart should be unknown to the most excellent of mothers, and the kindest of sisters, I have thought fit, thus early, to apprise you, that I have now found the woman, whom, if I can marry, I will. Do not charge me with precipitation. It is true, that I have not known her long; and have no surety that my suit will be acceptable; but, I have long known her character; and long, long since, met her, under circumstances, that can never be effaced from my remembrance, which established the goodness of her temper. Her disposition is what it should be; gentle, and patient, perhaps, beyond example; certainly, beyond any example, within the reach of my experience. But, contrary to the general rule, she does not want for spirit; and her talent is of the highest order. There is no pretension about her; but, I am justified in saying, that, in some matters, she has no rival. Her family are unexceptionable; or rather, were so; for, she is an orphan, and is now left upon the charity of some distant relatives. This state of dependance, is galling to her, I am sure; for it must be, to every generous mind. Yet, she is discreet enough to be cautious, in leaving it, for one, from which there is no escape, but by death. She has had many offers, and some, that few would have had the wisdom to reject. My temper has undergone a radical improvement since I have known her. It is only a few months, to be sure; and there is something not a little ridiculous, I confess, in ascribing such an effect, to the influence of a young girl, upon a man of my settled habit; yet, it is the simple truth. She has done more toward effecting a reformation in me, in several points, within this short time, than all the admonition, and all the entreaty of them, that I most love, continued, without intermission, for many years. Judge of her influence, then. If you were to see her, you would love her. “Her name! her name!” I hear you ask; by you there, I mean Anne; for I can see her blue eyes laughing brightly over the page, and her red lips parting impatiently, to practice the name of her intended sister. Well, her name is Juliet R. Gracie. “Is she rich?” No—not worth a dollar, thank heaven. “Is she handsome?” No. “Smart?” No. “Fashionable?” No. “Of high family?” No. “Then, what is she?” I'll tell you, Anne, if you will only listen to me, a moment. She is modest and sensibe;—pure of heart, and gifted with a beautiful spirit. She has genius, and true natural sensibility, gushing out for the real, not the imaginary affliction of life;—she has patience, that sweet tranquilising spirit, which makes martyrdom contagious. She has an affectionate disposition; fine, intelligent eyes, bashful as love, and instinct with the subdued expression of a passionate, deep, and settled spirit, darkening to their very centre, with the secret of her bosom; sweet lips, full of wisdom and gentleness; a countenance, where there is nothing to strike you, nothing to dazzle, nothing to intoxicate, or astonish; but every thing to love, for it is innocent and lofty. Her person is excellent, without being showy. It is, like her faculties, good, but unfitted for display,—withal, however, so delicate, that I tremble for her. Her constitution may not be broken; but the Z tincture of health is uncommonly variable, upon her cheek; and the paleness upon her forehead, too, alarms me. Her fortitude—would that I could speak of it, as it deserves!—but I cannot. Of her sincerity, that noblest of virtues, however, without betraying her confidence, I may be permitted to say, that it is positively sublime. She has dared to tell me, what few women would tell any man. I respect her for it. It has given me more confidence in her. She has loved before. The object, I have heard of. It is no light thing to be his successor, in the heart that he has ravaged and devastated. Yet so it is—and I shall be, if it be permitted unto me. I am now waiting my doom. My happiness is in her keeping. Heaven bless her! Whatever be her determination, heaven bless her! Yours, my beloved mother and sister, CHARLES GRENVILLE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HELEN TO HER MOTHER. Oh, my poor blind mother! And can it be, that the unnatural daughter hath made the last hours of that parent dark, who, in the helplessness of her infancy, would have fed her with the light of her own eyes! Can it be my mother, that the little Helen, thine own, thine only daughter, who was fed of thy beauty; and whom thou wouldst have nourished with thy life-blood, hath turned upon her mother, in the day of her bereavement; and smitten that bosom with death, where she once nestled so innocently!—those eyes, with blindness, that wept away their light upon her----O, my mother! my mother! What have I not suffered. The innocent babe, the unpractised child, whose ways were like the thought of thine own heart; she, who, in the morning of her days, would not have brushed away the dust from an insect's wing, with rudeness—she, who wept, if the bowed lily wept, or the pale rose shed its perfume, with a sickly quivering of the leaf—even she! what hath she become—an adultress!—a murderess!—a parricide!—She hath slain more than one husband—she hath! O, no, I dare not tell the truth.— He, the blessed martyr, he, whom thou hast unwittingly, so often called down the lightning upon—he, my living husband, is the man! He is the injured—the wronged— the broken hearted! He is dying; and I have destroyed him. Yet hath he forgiven me—wept over me; blessed thee, my mother, and the father that hath followed me! O, how little thou knowest him! Would that I could tell the whole. But the tremendous secret may not be told; —nay, who shall tell it. I have only a faint imagining of the truth. I cannot speak. My faculties are bound. My husband, O, bless him, the noblest and the truest heart that ever beat—he hath forbidden it, and my father's eyes look awfully down upon me, in the deepest midnight, when my heart is meditating treason to the vow; for I would tell it—I would, if I might; and then lay me down and die. But one day—O, it will come! Heaven will not permit the abused to go to their graves dishonoured —if it do, there is no justice in heaven. He is now lying in the next apartment—nay, perhaps, is now meditating on the devastation that I have caused, I, whom he hath so loved! I, to whom he hath hewed down his idols, one after the other, Love! Ambition! Revenge! —I—Oh mercy—mercy! I, that am so wicked, and worthless, and miserable. O Molton—thou! before whom my spirit could not stand upright, even at our first meeting, how will it meet thy rebuke, when thou shalt know all!—all!—. By the throne of the Eternal, mother, the fierce spirit that wears me, must have space and height for its operation. It must be free. Pity me—O, pity me—the awful mystery that encompasses me, as with a web of darkness and fire, may not be broken by me;— it may not, for a time! but when it is—O, my mother, thy heart will break with it; and thou, O my husband, my husband!—even thy great bosom will be shattered by it! Mother, why was I born? What deadly sin hadst thou, or thine ancestry committed, that, upon my poor head, there should accumulate this weight of horrour and consternation!—forgive me. I know not what I say. I am forbidden to write to thee. Father has written, perhaps; and has told thee that I am well. Do not believe him, mother. I am not well. There is a weight here—a fire here—unquenchable;—a weight, that the hand of God only can lift. Pray for me, mother; I cannot pray. The dark, frightful countenance of Remorse is now pressed to mine,—he sucks my breath---I feel it now, now!—and my poor lips,—O, they are parched to cinder. Hush! there are strange sounds at midnight;—it is near the time now—I wonder if Edward hears them. I don't know—it would be difficult to tell. He betrays nothing by his words; but his hand has grown mortally cold; nay, his whole arm, as it embraced me; and the thick, icy sweat has started out, all at once, from his forehead, as it lay upon my cheek—I have observed it. He thought me asleep—a cold tremour went over him —and he drew me closer to his bosom, like one that will not relinquish what it most loves, though he be supernaturally required. Ha!—nay, I hear nothing. But I feel somebody near me. I dare not look up—I continue writing, yet my pen will scarcely move over the paper.— It looks over me---I feel the coldness approaching---I have grown familiar with horrour lately---I—I It was my dear father. “To whom are you writing Helen?” said he, “To my mother, sir.” “Be careful not to alarm her,” said he, impressively. I promised to obey. Have I not kept the promise? O, mother, you are not, you have not been alarmed, have you mother? Ah, would that I were near you once more!---would it not refresh this poor wasted and desolate heart? It would. You would weep for me---love me the better, for my transgression, as a mother loves her sick babe the more for its sickness. Why art thou not here? Yet no---stay there, my mother, stay there. It is wiser---for, if Molton die---lo!---mother do thou pray for me! The very thought struck upon my brain, like a clod upon a coffin lid. The hollow sound is there yet. Let it not pass away. I care not how soon I am delirious---once so, my obligation ceases---I am no longer accountable. Mother, pray for me;---do you ever pray, now?—You, who were once so good, so sweet, so constant in prayer? No, you do not ---what! not pray---woman! look at me. See what you have brought me to—Me, Helen!---me, your only daughter. Had you prayed-- devoutly---taught me to pray, when my little hands had strength to join themselves together, the blessing were now upon your own head.--- But you did not. I knew no prayer---I was spoilt. Behold the consequences. Yet---O, my mother, I do love you—I do. It grows darker, darker, much darker —farewell—heaven bless you, and forgive me. HELEN MOLTON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FRANK TO JOHN. Portsmouth, N. Hampshire. Dear John— What you have told me of Molton amazes me; but, I am most concerned, and most cruelly sensible and interested, in what relates to Mr. Grenville and Juliet. It cannot be, I am sure, that her heart is made of such a material. Yet, it may—and there is no reasoning with the affections. The gentleman in question, I know nothing of. The worst fault that I can find, is, what seems to be something else, in your estimation. He has no enemies. At least, it would appear so, at present. If it be true, he must be insignificant. Virtue and distinction of character, will have enemies. Good men are never without them. Fools have no enemies. He who has no enemies, has no friends. Jesus Christ had enemies—and the best and wisest always have had, and always will have. It is a part of heaven's appointment of trial and temptation to man. Can the wicked and base feel other than enmity, for him that arrays himself, boldly and constantly, against their favourite indulgencies? No—unless Z 2 there be imbecility; and that is no barrier. But, enough of him. He is unworthy of her. Beside, there is too great a disparity in their years. It is less apparent now, than it will be; his habits are settled, hers are not. A man and wife, ought to grow old together, like their servants and their furniture. It is preposterous to mingle generations—nay, wicked. Heaven hath always paired the youthful, unless, when it would punish vice, or make avarice ridiculous, or lechery hateful. Enough.— Of one thing, I am certain. She will never marry, without a disclosure of her heart, and its whole history; and God help the man that consents to occupy a tenement, that is haunted by Molton. I know not who he is—I know not what are his powers. He appears to be, only a plain, positive man—very direct, and energetick; but, he has the mysterious faculty of consecrating to himself, and forever, whatever he touches, even in his wantonness. I have found it so. I do not say this, in bitterness. But, if Mr. Grenville have the courage, for she will never deceive him, to run the risk of having his repose darkened, and his temples bleached, by the presence of Molton's spirit—let him, in heaven's name! But, mark my words. The woman will deceive herself—Molton will abide there, and he will know it. Her memory will be his— her thought his—her tears, even in the arms of her husband, his—and his alone, forever, and forever! Let me quit the theme;—it is hateful to me. I could throw myself down upon the bed, and weep, for very sorrow, over the calamities, that I foresee. Poor, dear Juliet! would, that I might save thee!—O, how readily I would, even, at the peril of mine own peace—though my heart crumbled in the effort. Yet, farewell!—it may be, that heaven hath set its seal upon thy front—unspotted, unprofaned, a sweet flower, to die in blossom. Would, that it were so!—thy whole body, sweet, would gush up, in violets and snow-drops—farewell!—and now, for a livelier air. This is a very pretty town, built chiefly of brick, with a plenty of house room. They have a strange, convenient fancy, in this part of the world, of building prodigiously large, “roomy” houses; often, of such materials, that it will cost the rent, to keep them in repair; and, not unfrequently, I am told, there are to befound, some venerable buildings, of twenty or thirty—ages?—no, years; which have been so often repaired, and so effectually, that, like the ship, in which Cooke sailed round the world, there is not wood enough of the original stock left, to make a tooth-pick of. The girls are pretty, but singularly rude, here, and have been much more so, I am told. Nay there was a generation, whose commonest frolicks were, knocking off young men's hats, or taking their arms, in the street; driving four horses, standing up, over the side walks; tying old men's legs and arms together; and chucking cold water into the bosom of a dapper little parson, that once lived here;—and I am, told, and what is more, believe it, that it was no uncommon thing here, at one time, for the beautiful women of the place, to manifest a somewhat unnatural precipitation, in the birth of their first child; but, it never happens to the same person, a second time, however. At church, yesterday, a wicked fellow pointed out five fine looking women, to whom this awkward affair happened, nearly about the same time. The physicians were inconceivably alarmed at first. It seemed to be quite a dead set at the common doctrines of gestation; but it was at last, very satisfactorily accounted for, by the night air, long walks; and some other indulgencies, of a similar nature, persevered in, for rather too long a time, before marriage. Sarah is altogether better; and really, so beautiful, with the transparency of her complexion, and clearness of her quick hazle eyes, and the glossiness of her full hair, as to excite universal attention, even among the women here, who are, decidedly, the handsomest that I have seen, for a long while. In Boston, they were frightful; they turned my stomach inside out, in riding through; though she says that there are, somewhere, to be seen in the place, two or three downright lovely creatures;—there may be; all that I say is, that they ought to build temples to them. This town has been cruelly afflicted by fires; year after year, destroying hundreds of houses at a time. The consequence is that, though an old town, it has the appearance of a new one. There is little business done, now— being cut up by smaller places, and so situated, that Newburyport, another beautiful town, of 8, or 10,000 inhabitants, through which we passed, yesterday; and Salem, (where Sarah was sick—an opulent old fashioned matter of 12, or 14,000 inhabitants,) and Portland, which we have not yet seen, take off all its trade. Yet, the others, with the exception of Portland, are as little thriving, it would seem, as Portsmouth. Newburyport was visited by a tremendous fire too, a few years ago; and it is no wonder that they are so frequent and fatal, as most of the houses here, forty years old, are built of pine boards, and caught like tinder, after a little hot weather. Yet, they have a light, cheerful appearance; and, for country houses, I like them better than stone or brick, which are always damp and cold. Portsmouth is the capital of the state; and was the seat of government, till lately; but, for all such matters, I refer you, at once, to Morse's Gazetteer. My remarks shall be confined to manners,—when I meet with any. In Newburyport, there are none at all;—they look sad; and I should think the whole population was made up of creditors that could not get their pay, and debtors that could not pay. Adieu— FRANK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. I thank you, my dear Juliet, from the very depth of my heart, for your last kind letter. I have endeavoured to follow your advice; and, when we meet, which I hope, will be soon, I trust that you will see some other evidence than her word, that Sarah Ramsay is better and wiser for her sorrow. The dispensation was heavy, Juliet; and my heart was in its unpreparedness. In my poor father, all its affections were concentrated. All that had been torn away, from other cherished ones, had, it seemed to me, fastened upon him, as the nearest and best, for support and nourishment. I thought that I was prepared for almost every thing. O, I was cruelly mistaken. The blow came, as if it would shatter me. It fell—and I was alone. No father;—no mother!— no sister!—no brother;—forgive my tears, Juliet, they are a relief to me. My poor father, as you know, was never weakly indulgent to me; but his plain good sense, his household virtue, and his worldly wisdom—these were the substantial things of this life, without which, we are weaker than children. One only thing, did I pray for;— in all others, he was a good man. He wanted that earnest vitality of religion, which early sickness, and little else can, will always teach the sensible and meek heart, that lovely and beautiful religion, which steals upon us, like the dew of heaven, in purity, and freshness, while we are sleeping.—Yes, he wanted that; but he was nevertheless, a good man, practically good, and very useful. Let us hope—yea, I do hope, in humble confidence, that he hath had meted to him, the measure of love and forgiveness. Nay, more; I do believe it, for, when we parted, he blessed me, and bade me pray more frequently, saying that “it would be a comfort upon my death bed.” His countenance was serene, but earnest; and, during all the delirium which followed, with me, I heard his voice and saw his face, continually. Let us obey him, my dear Juliet—my sister. Yes—I will be thy sister.—And, now, to be less melancholy. By the way, Frank is somehow or other beside himself of late. What has happened to him? Can his spirits be artificial? Sometimes I think that they are. A thought strikes me, Juliet—hear me—it is said, that Grenville is making his regular approaches. Do not be precipitate. Situations have their influence.—While I have a home, and a house, it is the home and house of Juliet. Have I said enough?—I shall soon be there, and then we shall be happy. Shall I attempt to give you some account of our journeying, and plans? We propose going to Quebec. I find that a visit to one of my relations, which I shall make, by gradual stages, will carry me up the Kennebeck river, to a place not more than sixty miles from Quebec; and how can I return without having been there, particularly with so elegant a fellow as Frank, for a protector. I assure you that, we attract a good deal of attention; and, in spite of all his artifices, I can perceive, by the sparkling of his eyes, and an occasional silliness about his handsome mouth, mighty common in our moments of self-complacency, when we try to conceal our pleasant thoughts—that he is much flattered by it. I write in spirits, Juliet, for I feel in spirits; and it were a wicked affectation, I think, at such a season, when heaven is all blue above us, and the beautiful earth, so green, to shut up our senses in sorrow for the past. No—I can think of my father, without forgeting my Maker. And I can enjoy the colour and incense that surround me, I hope, without any unbecoming negligence of either:—but Frank has just left me, laughing at the freedom of the women here; some country girls, I suppose—they took his arm without any ceremony, as he was sauntering along, under one of the most magnificent old elm trees in the world. He was astonished, shocked at their indelicacy; but a little conversation set him right. They were women of sense and education; and, when questioned, candidly attributed their conduct to the scarcity of beaux, who, they say, are in the habit of running away, from their native town, as soon as they can go alone, and as fast as they are able. Frank said that he did not wonder at it—for which compliment, they invited him home. Really, he says, he found those very romps, whose manners had so alarmed him at first, and he really had a great deal of sensitiveness, entertaining and sensible. Frank's manners, you know, would recommend him any where; and, when he produced his letters, which was not until he was on the most familiar footing, what was his surprise to find that some of them were to the fathers, brothers, and friends of those very women. He was embarrassed, but they were not, at all, and laughed heartily at the affair, as a good joke. Salem.—Which we left Saturday morning, appears to be a place of considerable importance; and, from its proximity to Boston (only twelve or fourteen miles distant) to participate in all the fashion and amusements of that place. I was very kindly treated there, and I must say that the yankee women are much better educated, and in general, handsomer, more womanly in their deportment, than we, of the south. I do not think that they have our grace, finish, refinement and delicacy, or rather sentiment; and their style of dress, to my eye, is unbecoming; but all this may be prejudice; and I dare say it is, for, with the fashion, our opinions change, both of manners and dress. They are more English, and the southerners more clearly French, in every thing. Their very walk, and dancing are peculiar, short, hurried and active; like a money-making people, determined to have their money's worth. Yet, I have seen some of the best bred men here, that I have ever met with, calm, sedate, self-collected, confident, and sensible. Newburyport—A place about a dozen miles from Salem, over which road we rattled, with an amazing velocity, in the mail coach (for I have sent home the carriage—it was quite too great a care on my mind) containing, I believe, about nine or ten thousand inhabitants, is really a handsome little town. Frank does not like it; but I do. It is true—we were not much noticed; but what could we expect? We only stopped a few hours; but, during that time, I had the good fortune to meet with one fine woman, whom I shall not forget. She knows my relative, and treated me with the plain, cordial, unaffected kindness of a relation, or of an old acquaintance at least. I found her intelligent, pious, and lady-like.— You have heard of the Salem-witches. Many were burnt there. The buildings are often of wood, and truly New England.—I do not know what more I could say. It implies all that is honest, shrewd, calculating, clean and comfortable, for one generation. Let the next take care of itself, seemed the first maxim. But cannot we account for this better, than by a want of foresight, in a people so conspicuous for seeing further than their neighbours? The towns grew rapidly—labour was cheap;— lumber (by which word, they include all stuff made of pine, such as logs, joist, spars, timber, shingles, clapboards, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.) plenty and cheap; and their trade, in the early settlement, was chiefly in lumber, to the West Indies; a trade however, that, like our tobacco planting at the south, was sure to impoverish them that pursued it, in the long run. It was more important of course, to men so employed, to keep their little capitals active, and their labour in its most productive channels. What were they? Navigation, and shipping. They grew rich, therefore, in clapboard houses; and are now gradually replacing them, as they decay, with brick and stone. You have heard a great deal of New England cunning, and Yankee “trickery;” yet, I have observed, that they, who are most prejudiced against the Yankees, seem to know the least of them. I never met with any person that had been among them, who did not speak of them with affection and respect. And I have observed this fact, even at the south, where, you know, they consider all that are north, of themselves, to be Yankees. Thus, in the Carolinas and Virginia, the Pennsylvanians are Yankees. In Pennsylvania, the New-Yorkers are so. Avoid the errour;—the five New England states are jealous of the prerogative. They are, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New Hampshire—Vermont is since made up among them; and now the District of Maine is making up—so that there will be six New England states, the people of which, and they only, are Yankees. The fact, that I was about to mention, is this. At the south, I have frequently heard the Yankees condemned in a lump; but I have always heard the particular acquaintances of the speaker, excepted. In this way, I have heard nearly all the Yankees of a large city, excepted at different times, from the sweeping denunciation! But—the prejudice is wearing away. We begin to assimilate.— “We are no longer, in their opinion,—a people of billiard players,—slave dealers, and horse jockies; nor they, in ours, a people made up of dealers in wooden ware, and “long and short sarse,” as, it is said, they call vegetables, turnips, onions,—potatoes being “round sauce; which they pronounced sarse, and carrots, beats, parsnips, &amp;c. long sauce.” They do call vegetables sauce; that I can aver, for I have heard it often. Another thing that strikes a stranger from our world here, is the being waited upon, by the family at the taverns, and often by genteel girls. They have their whims, it is true; but they are a hard working, religious, sober people, who may always be depended upon, in the hour of trial. Look at the men of the revolution? Where did the spirit first appear? Who withstood, so soon, or so steadily, the continual encroachment and inroad of power? The men of New England may justly boast of their ancestry.— They were the persecuted pilgrim,—mistaken, no doubt, in points of faith, but never mistaken in his duty to God. Their “family jewels” are not hand-cuffs nor manacles; no convicts were exported to New England;—and the people are more purely national than any other in America. It is rare to see a Frenchman here;—and an Italian, Spaniard, German, or other European is a prodigy.— Blacks, too, are scarcely to be seen; and they that are so, are freemen, humble, industrious, and orderly. No, Juliet, we have wronged this people. They have poured in their population upon us, as we have ours upon the south. It is the natural appointment of heaven. The hardy barbarians of the north, have always overrun the slothful and effeminate men of the south; and they always will; yet, must we look to the south for genius,—here for talent; there for poetry and rhetorick, and eloquence, and painting; here for wisdom, law, mathematicks and scholarship. And so it is—the most learned body of divines in the world perhaps, of their age, are to be found in New England. They are a school of protestant Jesuits. Do not listen to the vulgar stories about this people. Ninety-nine out of one hundred, that we have heard, again and again repeated, as Yankee tricks, are A a either inventions; aggravations; old stories, newly dressed; or were not committed by Yankees. They are now, however, the legitimate parent of every trick, as an Irishman is, of every blunder, no matter who may beget it. For my own part, I have no reason to believe that dishonesty is more common here, than with us;—if it were, and practised as a trade, there would be no dealing with these men, I confess. They are so persevering; up early and late; and move with such a substanstial regularity, in all the affairs of life. They are the Scotch of America. Farewell—I shall write to you next from Portland—I hope. SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK. Molton is gradually recovering from the wound; but there is some incurable disease, of which his physicians are forbidden to speak, that will inevitably carry him to his grave. What can it be? Can it be the “perilous stuff” that a troubled conscience will engender? I know not. But this I know, that the oldest and wisest of his physicians, when he spoke of Molton, to me, but the other day, spoke of him with feeling and affection; and, when I alluded to this hidden disease,—his face altered amazingly—a strange expression, compounded of horrour and doubt, it appeared to me, passed athwart it. I pursued my inquiries; but he looked at me kindly, shook his head, and departed. My curiosity was unappeasable. I assailed the other two, in succession; but with precisely the same success, except that the younger, a free hearted, noble fellow, about my own age, added, as he left me, these words—“Edward Molton is no common man.” Helen is perpetually by his bed side;—it is not a moment since I left him, sitting up, supported by pillows; the air gently stirring the white drapery of the bed; and just light enough in the room, for all the shutters were drawn, and all the windows except one, darkened—to see Helen sitting on a low stool by him; her face uplifted to him, with such an expression of awe and delight, of pity and passionate love—with a dash too, of gentleness and melancholy—ah! the delirious brightness of her half-shut eyes! —the eager parting of her sweet lips!—her short, quick, deep breathing—her dark tresses, wreathed and undulating brightly, from her upturned forehead of transparent clearness—every breath a sob!—O, by heaven, brother, to have such a creature wait and feed upon my countenance, for one minute, like that, I would consent to die. How do I stand toward Molton? Simply and truly thus—I love him, I respect him, more than I ever believed that I could love and respect any man but you, Frank. I feel a constantly augmenting attachment. Every hour makes me more familiar with him; yet, every hour, I find him more august. There is a terrible simplicity in the operation of his mind, when we are once admitted behind the curtain. I do not pretend to understand him. I feel that I cannot. There is more longitude and latitude, more elevation and depth in his thought, than I am yet able to conceive. At times I have thought that I was near to the secret fountain of his strength; that his foundations were uncovered. I was mistaken—the springs lay deeper, and the pillars were sunken where I dared not penetrate. And, at last, the sum of all my discovery is, that, the nearer we approach him, the more we are oppressed with a sense of his amplitude. It is like journeying in the highlands,—the elevations that you have passed, are only stepping stones to what is before you, no matter how long you have travelled, or how wearily;—and the prospect enlarges with your ascent.—Good night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday Morning, —. I have just left my bed. Last night was the first, in which I have been permitted to sleep soundly; and I shall spend the morning, until service, in relating a narrative that Molton has made to me, concerning certain stories, in which we are deeply concerned. You will let Sarah have this; I shall continue it, day by day, as I have time, until the whole be related. Yesterday, as we sat together;—he, leaning upon the shoulder of Helen, he renewed the subject of certain stories; and went deliberately through them, one by one, with the solemnity of a dying man, who would be at peace with all the world. His words have impressed themselves upon my memory, with a distinctness that is wonderful; and his manner was so calm and impressive, that I shall not forget it, to my dying day. “It is true,” said he,—“I do not deny it; that, as is alleged, I did manifest uncommonly premature signs of wickedness. I was a liar. I should have become a drunkard in time; for I often drank brandy, with sugar, until my cheeks were inflamed. I was a coward too.— And I was a thief. I can recal many acts of deliberate cunning and villany, perpetrated by me, before I was ten; acts, which have made it little less than miraculous, that I have escaped the Penitentiary. It is all true. But did your informer know that I am an altered man. Mr. Omar, I am but just rising from a sick bed. A man must have no common degree of hardihood, who can trifle with the sacredness of truth, at such a moment. I wish you to believe me. It will be a comfort to you, one day or other. You have thought well of me; and I pledge myself that, the more intimately you know me, the better you will think of me—the more you will love me—and respect me. You ought to know what I am, as well as what I was. At twelve years of age, I undertook, unaided and alone, the work of reformation. I was a liar—I am so no longer. I was intemperate, in childhood. As a man, I am temperate, almost beyond example. The taste of spirituous liquor, simple or compound, I only know from memory; and, for nine years I never drank a glass of wine.— I was exceedingly profane. Now, you will hardly hear a profane word pass my lips, from one year's end to another. I was a coward. I am so no longer. I smoked —and was guilty of other vices. I have done with them all, and forever. Not that I have no vices left—no, I know better. I know that I have a devil within me— but it is a crowned and sceptred devil. I am proud as Lucifer. What I have once made up my mind to do, that have I always done. No difficulties have disheartened me;—no danger intimidated me. I appeal to my life. If I had been a bad man, then, with my perseverence and address, was there any thing that I could not have accomplished? Yet, what do you hear of me—evil report; vague, dark, glimmering and contradictory speculations. My chief characteristick, I believe, is determination, unconquerable determination. I have learnt to respect myself. I knew what I can do; and, what is more, in what time I can do it. But let me give you some examples. I was a boy— there were but few things that a boy could do, to distinguish himself. I thought of them; resolved; and, in a little time, I had no rival. It is of little consequence what they were; they were a part of my trade. I was covetous of other glory. I had a friend that could reason. I learnt to reason, until few were willing, or able to enter the list with me. I had a talent, no matter of what nature, that slept, and might have slept forever, unheeded, in darkness; but another friend grew conspicuous for his. I arose then, and battled with him. In my turn, I became known, and wondered at. I had a talent for poetry. The world said that I had no other talent. I laughed at them. I laboured, toiled, sweated at the furnace of the mind. Still, I was unknown. Still I was told, that I should live and die a poet, and nothing but a poet. I resolved, calmly and deliberately, that I would not; I dashed the cup from my lips. I plucked down my idol, Poetry; reduced her to an impalpable powder; and scattered the glittering dust to the four winds of heaven. I resolved to worship her no longer—nay, not even to wait at her temple. I was laughed at. I was told that I could not abstain; that A a 2 poetry was aliment, and breath, and life to me. Yet, my resolution hath been kept, shall be kept, to my dying day. Not a line have I written since; not a line will I write.” What I once resolve to accomplish, I already so know myself, that I feel as if it were half done. I was invited to join a society. It was proposed to change the night of meeting, for my accommodation. I visited it at one of the sittings. I entered into debate;—was triumphant, against many competitors; and proposed, in form, for admission. The next day, the second officer waited on me; and, after some stammering, informed me that I had been ballotted for, and—rejected. I told him that I was sorry, for the sake of the society; that I considered it a compliment to them, that I had thought of joining them, even after their importunity; and, that I would not join them then, though they elected me, in a body, and presented me a diploma, upon their knees. They reconsidered the question. They did elect me, unanimously. The same officer came again. I kept my promise. I belonged to another society. I was one of its original founders. It flourished, beyond example. I saw fit, no matter for what reason, to say that I would quit it, unless a certain proposition were adopted. It was not adopted—for nobody believed that I was in earnest—nobody thought that I would leave the institution. Yet, I did leave it, and forever. I had supported myself by my pen, for many years; it was time to embark in a profession, full of discouragement. I was tempted abroad. I could have been sent to the American Congress; the offer was made to me. But no—I resolved to succeed, or perish, in one particular place, because every body told me that I should not succeed. I had no friends—yet, I deliberately abandoned my only resource, my pen, because it appeared inconsistent with my plan. What then?—I did succeed. Thus much, for my peculiarity of temper. Many more incidents, I might give, but I will not. There are enough to show you that, if I had resolved to be a bad man— there was nothing to arrest my course, or turn my hand aside. It is always easier to be wicked than good—particularly, when one is beset on every side, by temptation, poverty, evil, and reproach;—without friends, and almost without hope; certainly, without encouragement, except that, which is inwardly furnished, by a proud heart, confirmed in its experience, and confident of itself, in the extremest peril. That was my case. Years ago, I foresaw all that has since happened; all that will happen. I looked upon it steadily, as upon the ebbing and flowing of a midnight sea—shattered, it might be, now and then, in the star-light, by the sudden emerging of some spirit—the dashing of some great wing that went over it, or the plunge of some adventurous bark; but ebbing and flowing, nevertheless, with an everlasting steadiness—and governed forever, by the same immutable law, in its tremendous wrath, or in its still more tremendous repose. But, to the matter in question. I was hated. I was unsocial; when I left my native village, no blessing, and no prayer went with me. I went, as to the gallows, certainly, in the opinion of the wise. And it was God only —God, and mine own strength, that turned my destiny aside. Yes—I did once, deliberately insult a lady, at a dinner table. Nay, more than once—for, on another occasion, I have seen my best friend leave the table in tears, at some inhuman ribalry of mine;—and once, I remember telling a lady, very distinctly, that she lied, at table, while her lover was sitting by her side. Nay, it was not, perhaps, in so many words; but the amount was the same, for I said this:—“I do not accuse you of telling a deliberate falsehood; yet, the story is false; and I have the charity to believe that you have told it so frequently, that you now believe it yourself.” It was brutal. I am ashamed of it. But the other case, and I know not which is meant, was yet worse. There have been those, Mr. Omar, who have dared to imagine that they could be insensible to any thing that I could say. Nay, I was once told so. I was once told that a person would never think of being angry with me. It was calmly said, but I felt it. My heart turned bitter, with my breath. That person was mistaken. By heaven, there never lived that human being, whose blood I could not make boil in his veins—whose heart I could not turn green, in his bosom, at my bidding.” Tuesday Evening.—“Well. The case was this. I was invited to drink a glass of wine, with a lady. I loathed wine. My conscience had forbidden it. The friend that urged me, knew it. The lady, with whom I was requested to drink, was in a most pitiable situation. She was just recovering from an illness, that had unsteadied her brain.—I would have bled for her—died for her. But I would not drink wine. I refused. Behold my deliberate insult. Yet it was chiefly ignorance. I did not know then, that I might be permitted just to touch my lips to the glass, and leave it. I thought that the fashion was, to drink it, every drop. Had it been a mortal poison, I would have drunk it, to make any one that I loved, happier. But, as it was, my complaisance would not permit me. I would not take physick for fashion's sake. I refused; and here, I have a remark to introduce, which has always been a governing principle with me. Let it be so with you. I love politeness. I hold it to be the next best thing to religion, for quieting the rude, and restraining the profligate; yet, the true gentleman will never be known by his resemblance to any body.—His fashion is his own, full of self-possession and dignity; he carries meaning and authority in every movement. You see that he is not fashionable—but you see that he is something better. You see that fashion, as it is, the coxcombry and invention of fools, to preserve their insignificance from detection, is something beneath him.— Yet, you dare not call him unfashionable. Go where he will; in what dress he will; in what age he will— among what people he will, it is always the same. But how would it fare with one of your fine gentlemen of the common cast—were he caught out of his own company, among strange people, in the courts of Europe?— He would be taken for a man-milliner;—a something to be played with, and laughed at, by the ladies;—a ridiculous contrivance, made to fetch and carry gloves and fans;—an automaton to hold on by in your lounging.—The maxim was this. When I was in any unexpected situation, no matter how new or how suddenly—my first object, was to do what I thought proper, without imitating anybody. If I went wrong, an air of confidence carried me through; and the well bred doubted whether I were not better bred than themselves. But, if they had caught me imitating anybody, they would have detected my ignorance and awakwardness, at once; and would have had a standard upon which to graduate my gentility. If you are in doubt, always act with decision and promptitude. No matter where you are. That will carry you through. And above all—remember that---it is better for a man, to be thought regardless of form, than ignorant of it. For the former, he may be respected—for the latter, he is always ridiculed. So it was, in this case. I was hated for my ill temper—but I was respected, in spite of all, much more, than if I had made myself sick with the wine.—I could appeal to the lady herself, at this moment; and she would tell you of her uncommon regard for me. But there was another case. I wounded the woman whom I most respected on earth, at the time; I wounded her to the heart, at table. She arose and left the room, in tears. It was no premeditated offence. I was not even conscious that my words had been capable of the cruel interpretation, which had struck her. I pursued her to her room. Her husband was my dearest friend.— He was away. I was in some sort the delegated protector of his wife, in his absence. Judge of my feeling, when, after begging her pardon—she told me that “had her husband been there, I would not have dared to say what I had said.” “Not dared,” said I— “madam, you do not believe me. I told you that it was not meant. Of course, it would have made no difference, whether he were there or not. But you know me;—and I trust, know enough of me, to believe that when I mean to wound, I leave no room for conjecture in the mind.— I strike home—to the very core—. Farewell!—” I left her.—She had forgotten the natural generosity of her nature, and we had well nigh parted forever; but we did not. We were friends again. Whether we are now, or not, I cannot tell. All that I know is, this— that I respect and love her;—and, if we ever meet, shall treat her, if she will permit me, as I did, when we parted, though much has happened since, to make me proud, and her foolish.—Another thing has always been a maxim with me. It is written in blood. If I suffer— never to let the world know it. If I run my head against a post, I am the first to laugh at it; and, at this moment, were I dying of a broken heart, there is not that creature breathing, who would be able to say, that he knew it, or that he ever heard me complain. But I affect no melancholy. I have no wish to be interesting. I cannot stoop to play the hero, for women and children. It is the fashion, to be sure, if one wishes for the reputation of genius, to be very unhappy, peculiar, dark and magnificent. All that is childish to me. I prefer, rather, if I must act, to act cheerfulness.—You will forgive these occasional digressions. I throw them in, as they occur, merely that you may have a faithful copy of my thought, in its natural movement and operation. But perhaps the writer alludes to a very different circumstance; and to one that happened more recently.— Let me relate it, as it was; and then Omar, do thou judge between her and me. You have heard of the beautiful Mrs. Warren, whose husband is known for many things that are especially pleasant—but chiefly as being the husband of Mrs. Warren. He plays the flute sweetly; is passionately fond of musick and money;—and once, it is said, offered his hand, with the most familiar air in the world, to the First Consul of France. But all this may have little to do with his wife, who is really, in the company of women, alone, a very pleasant, entertaining, unaffected creature—but in the company of men, men whom she means to astonish—O, she is quite another matter. It happened that I was presented to her. She condescended to be very ineffable. But as I had heard of her, I determined not to be astonished at anything—but rather to astonish her.— Yet how should I do it?—There was only one way—to act naturally, speak naturally, and honestly. To a fashionable woman, that would be the greatest rarity; and I should be the greatest monster in the world. By some chance, it happened, half a century ago, perhaps, that this lady was presented to the Queen of England. Now, it is no light thing, you may know, for a plain republican, like me, to see majesty at second hand; and next to seeing the queen, was seeing one, that had seen her, you know. I knew all this—yet, if you will believe me, there was no hurry in my blood. She spoke of her “uncle—the general,” and “his carriage.”—She managed it very prettily. It almost took my sight away, I assure you. Yet, as true as you sit there, my dear Omar, I was able to keep my seat.— She then condescended to mention Mrs. Siddons. I asked her, if she had seen her. “O yes!” said she, with the practised air of one, that was hand and glove with Mrs. Siddons. But something, I know not what—perhaps it was her resemblance to an old friend of mine, which was really so great, at times, that I was on the point of catching her hand, and applauding her—and something, of doubtfulness, in her tone; and a little shifting of the eye, as she said this, made me resolve, spitefully enough, to be sure, to push the question home, until I knew exactly the truth, and the extent of her intimacy. “Ah!” said I, in reply—“well, pray, what were the talents of Mrs. S. in conversation? “Ah—I—I have heard (faintly articulated) that she is remarkable for the beauty of her conversation.— But such dignity!” “In private life?—on the stage, to be sure, she is queenly, I—.” “O yes—in private life;”—certainly, Mr. a—a—Molton—in private life.” “Was she pleasant and natural in her manner?—I am delighted to find that you knew her so well.” “No—I cannot say that I—I knew her well. I have —seen—hem!—her—once—I remember—in the exhibition rooms—at Somerset house”— “In the exhibition rooms—at Somer—!” echoed I, with a look of unaffected astonishment, and stopped short for her reply. She was a little confused. Her perfectly lady-like— self-possession fled for a moment; and she added, a little, a very little petulantly—“yes, sir—but it was no common privilege to be admitted there.” The devil it was'nt! thought I. Another might have foreborne here. But I—I knew that she was in my power; and I determined to punish her for such a vain profanation of her good sense. I reiterated my question, as I would have examined a witness, without any apparent aim, until I arrived at the truth, that all her acquaintance with Mrs. Siddons, amounted to her having passed her once, while she was sitting in a picture room. Well—the lady read well; and she knew it. A little book lay upon the table; and, taking it for granted, as hundreds of people do, who are taught to be well bred, by such scoundrels as Chesterfield—as people, are cookery, out of book,—that, to entertain a man, you must talk to him of his trade, no matter how hateful it is to him;—she began to expatiate upon poetry. And then, she began to read a page out of Rogers' Human Life, I believe, about a cricket. She read charmingly. Had the theme been worthy of her voice and manner, I should have listened to her a long time, I confess, without yawning in her face; but, as it was, I could not make up my mind to a lie. She finished. “There!” said she, shutting the book, “there! Mr. Molton—is'nt that poetry?” her fine eyes full of enthusiasm. “No!” I answered. She was thunderstruck. My friend laughed outright; and I was sure that I should never be forgotten. Such a violation of bienseance. She complains of it yet, I am told. Well, let her—she is full enough of bienseance; and her fool of a husband too—. She recovered immediately, however, and, in a much more sprightly and natural manner, rang a series of musick upon many a pleasant theme, for a whole hour.— “Do pray tell me. Is there anything new in the literary world?” said she, at last, to me. My friend looked at me, and smiled. “Yes, madam.” said I;—“Lord Byron has published a new poem.” “Ah!—what is it called?” “Don Juan.” “Can it be had here, do you know?” `I have it,” said I—“and it is at your service. But— let me not deceive you. It is cruelly condemned for its licentiousness. My friend there, says (and he has just returned it to me) that he would not permit his wife or his sister to read it. Another, who has read it, returns it to me, with a similar observation. Dare you read it? Will you read it, notwithstanding this;—and, on my simple recommendation? Believe me—it will reward you. It is full of beauty, deep tenderness and passion,—occasional sublimity—poetry so brilliant, yet so delicate, that— “Every touch that woes its stay “Will brush its brightest hues away. But, full of raciness and pungency—yet, stained with impurity, profligacy, and irreligion. What say you? There is much to forgive; much to pity; but not more than in the School for Scandal—nor so much as in Rowe's Fair Penitent? I have a better opinion of women than Mr. D — has—I am not afraid to trust them with such a book.” “I will read it,” said she, “without any hesitation.” “That is what I expected,” said I—“and I have many reasons for wishing it—I want your example—to protect a person, to whom I lent it—a young lady.” She interrupted me—“O, I have read many a page that I would prohibit to a young lady.” “I have no doubt of it,” said I, very gravely. This was too much, for my friend. He roared outright. He knew and I knew, that the lady had the reputation, whether justly or not, I do not pretend to say, not being of the privileged order—of having her rooms furnished quite à la françoise—with naked Apollos and Venuses; a pair of whom, it is said, once frightened a little child, who ran down stairs screaming, that she had peeped into B b the room!—and there were aunt and uncle Warren— standing up in the corner,—naked as they were born!— But I respected her the more for her independence. I love nature. I love that estimable frankness which speaks promptly, when promptly questioned. If it be not a virtue, it deserves to be one; and is ten thousand times more graceful and bewitching, than all the foolery and nothingness of fashionable life. Well—the next day, I waited on the lady, and left the book with her. That day, she stayed at home;—and, the next, she returned me the book,—apparently about one quarter read—and in great displeasure. I know not why, but I believed that she must have read it; and I could not suppress a resentful swelling of the heart, to think how I had been deceived in her. I pursued her to her carriage;—she was a good deal disturbed; her haughtiness disappeared—her voice trembled—nay, I will not swear that there was not a filling of her beautiful eyes—when she shut herself in. By the Being that made me, Omar, I would have gone down on my knees in the dust, before I would have touched that woman's heart, unkindly—Had I believed that it was modesty, the sweet bashfulness of a naked feeling—I would sooner have died, than doubted or tried her. But—I could not believe this. She had travelled. She had read. She had seen pictures. The book was no such mighty matter. I had told the truth—and she ought to have believed me; or, at least, have manifested a less suspicious resentment.— One that had an unsullied heart;—one that was inexperienced;—one whom I truly, and from the bottom of my heart, respected, had read it. Yet, when she returned it to me—her simple, sweet admonition, was only this.— “There is your book. I suppose that I ought to be offended;—but I do not avail myself of the privilege.” “Thus much for this matter—.” Good night, Frank.—Tomorrow, I shall recommence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Morning— The next affair is a trifle in comparison. I cannot bring myself to regard it seriously. No, Mr. Omar; I have much to repent of—much to lament, in sorrow and humiliation; but I have not the weight of seduction; nay, nor of adultery, upon my soul. For this, I thank God. Blood, I can bear—but not the breath of deflowered innocence. Death, I could smile at; but the writhing lip of an abused husband, would be intolerable to me. He might not feel—there are such men—but I, I should feel. I should put myself into his place;—and my heart would dissolve with sickness and affright. Would I not be avenged?—I would.—But how?—Not by letting out the blood of my betrayers, upon the very sheets that they had profaned. No— that were the revenge of a boy—a fool. No!—but I would sit down, calmly by them; call up my children—strangle them, one by one, in her presence— and die—die at her very feet. But not a hair of her head would I touch, in wrath.—No—she that had once slept upon my bosom, should never see mine heaving angrily with her.—I should speak no loud word—shed no tear— it may be; but, with my babes, unpolluted, upnrofaned, I would abandon her, and go to heaven—as I might.— But, let me return; my feelings carry me away. It happened, one day, that I had some gentlemen to dine with me. I was a brute and a fool, and got drunk. They, however, were less discreet than I; for I discovered it, and went, as I thought, to my own room, to bed. It was late in the afternoon. While there, I had an indistinct notion, that some woman was continually disturbing me. I arose—made a dead set at one that I saw, and tore the handkerchief from her bosom. She was frightened, I dare say; broke away, and left me, sprawling, near the fire place. The next day, I heard the truth. I had gone to a wrong room; and a vulgar girl had been sent to the closet for something. I made my apology to her mistress; and all passed off very pleasantly, until, one evening, when I saw the same girl, busying herself in a manner that amused me, not a little, near my chamber, in such a manner, that I was sure to see her. I had no respect for her, and felt, I confess, rather inclined for a game of romps. I invited her into my room, to set a button on my collar. This, I gave, as an excuse for her—not for myself; for I knew that she wanted to come in. She came, and I was rather rude to her, I confess it—yet, it was nothing more than country girls are bred up to—a little hugging and kissing. She made a mighty fuss about it—to be sure—considering her vulgarity and ugliness; but that, I have found always to be the case—always—the least agreeable are the most unmanageable. Her mistress too, took it up, and carried her head pretty high, for some weeks; but it was, at last, wisely forgotten, for just what it was, a foolish, not a wicked frolick. No—they who know me, know this— that if I would—that is, if I had set my heart upon such wickedness, there would have been no arresting me in my course. Blood—danger—death, I should have laughed at. The next case is quite serious; but, notwithstanding my transgression, at first, I do contend, that, when the whole story is known, it is honourable to me. I met with a fine looking woman, in the stage coach. Her child was with her. I entered into conversation with her—and, before we arrived at Salem, in New England, where I intended to stop, my “veins ran lightning.” I sat next to her, upon the same seat; and, when I alighted, her hand trembled—her frame shook—and there was a pulse to her finger-ends. She said, in a voice scarcely audible—“Good night!—I am sorry that you are to leave us.” She told the truth. She was sorry. It went to my heart. I had kept up her spirits, for many a weary mile. I had just learnt her name, and found that I knew something of her family. It was very respectable. It was getting dark, and she would be nearly alone in the carriage. I was not sorry to find, that, if I staid at all, I must stay all the next day; a thing that I could not do; for I was pledged to be in Boston. I entered the carriage again. I do not tell you how I prevailed; but, I did prevail on this woman, to consent to see me, the following night, at a very respectable house, where she was to introduce me, as a relation of her husband—and by my true name—for I never use disguise at such moments. Confidence begets confidence, even in the worthless. I left her. I went to bed; but I could not sleep. I felt that I was about to be a villain. I was afraid to be one; yes, afraid, to be so base a thing, as the destroyer of a husband's honour;—so damnable a thing, as the blaster of a family's peace. I resolved to break my promise.— It went hard with me; harder, to break my word, than to abstain from crime. But—look at me, Omar. I never saw that woman afterward. To this hour, we have never met. What think you now, of my self-command—of my principles? For the next, my heart bleeds. It was a shameful thing in me. Yet I was neither guilty, nor meditated guilt. It was merely an unhallowed curiosity; that spirit which has twice brought me to the very brink of perdition.— Let me beware of the third time. My good angel may be weary, and let go her hold, at last! But the facts are simply these. I was in the country. I had the prospect of a dreary evening before me, at a tavern, where I had put up. Some person happened to mention that there was a quilting in the neighbourhood—I inquired the way; it was some distance; and, with my usual indifference to consequences, I hunted up the house, entered and joined, heart in hand, with their frolicking. There were only two rooms. Both were open, and both were crowded. In one, was a bed, upon which those that were tired of dancing, threw themselves, without any kind of ceremony. I was inconceivably diverted, at the flings and flourishes that I saw;—and the house shook as if it had an ague. It stood high, upon four piles of block; and the windows rattled to our dancing, like a cart of loose iron, over a paved road. However, I shall not attempt to describe it. I was ready for any thing, and made some advances to the prettiest girl in the room. Her lover sat by her, a sheepish looking, handsome fellow; and she repulsed me with rudeness. This—from a woman, and a pretty woman too, was never very palatable to me. I determined to be avenged. But no opportunity occurred. I was on the point, indeed, of abandoning her, and going home with another warm hearted, affectionate creature, who, as I helped her upon her horse, returned B b 2 my embrace, with a timidity that disturbed my philosophy most cruelly. But—she was pretty—and I trembled to trespass upon her loveliness; for she had treated me, imprudently, to be sure, but not haughtily. I let her escape me;—and, unwilling to return to my uncomfortable lodging, I pushed on, after the company had gone, to a house at a distance, where I saw a light. I entered, and met a man who knew me; a man, who had been indelicate enough, but a few evenings before, to leave me, deliberately, and pointedly, alone, with his daughter, for a whole evening. He invited me to join in a game at cards. I detest cards. Once, I loved them —I gambled—repented, and abandoned them. I refused. In sauntering about the house, I entered a room dimly lighted, in which I saw a woman and a man, sitting together, in silence, by a stove. I approached. It was the very girl!—It was her lover! My heart beat hurriedly. Here then was the opportunity I wanted. Some bad, very bad thoughts went through my heart—but they rested not. They were of evil omen—and were scared away by each other. Yet something, I was determined to do. I prepared my plan. * * * * I do not say how I succeeded;— but I did succeed, as far as I wished. I persuaded that girl, a modest, sweet girl, who had scorned me, but a few minutes before, to abandon her lover, and enter a remote apartment in the same building, with me, a stranger. I will not trouble you with the particulars. I will only say that she refused to go—and that I went, nevertheless, and waited for her, assured that she would come. She did come. The room was large;—the windows were opposite to each other; and there was a piazza in front. I was afraid of being seen, and led her to a corner—and was laughing and whispering with her, innocently, upon my honour, when we heard her father's voice. He approached. She was half frightened to death. He came to the foot of the stairs, near the door, and called. I know not what he suspected. But my mind was instantly made up, to an unpleasant retribution. In such cases, I never flinch. He opened the door; and I walked out, under his arm, under the very flambeau that he held!—He stood like one thunderstruck.— The door of the opposite room was open. The man of whom I before spoke, sat fronting it, with his hands up. He saw me come out—and the next moment, he saw the affrighted girl follow me. He dropped his cards. Can you wonder at it? The thought went into his heart like a knife. Here was I, the acquaintance of ten minutes, found in a dark room with a girl. Could he ever forget that he had purposely exposed his only daughter to me, for hours? Mr. Omar—I do reproach myself for this. I did then. And had the father fallen upon me, on the spot, I should scarcely have lifted my hand against him, even in defence of my life. Yes—though my intentions were innocent—by this I mean that I would not have wronged the honour of that girl, yet I did what was worse. I corrupted her heart. I blotted out her delicacy. I breathed upon her lips—and her heart was in a thaw. For this, I shall never forgive myself. It was cold blooded, atroeious vanity in me. How happened it, that I prevailed? I'll tell you. A modest woman has no experience in the ways of men. She is therefore more submissive, and obedient. What I demanded of this poor girl, was demanded with that air of consummate ease, which cannot be resisted, by the inexperienced. Ask a woman for any favour, as if you are not sure of it, and she will refuse you, of course; but demand it, as if you have not the slightest thought of refusal, and it is ten to one that she grants it, as a matter of course. If she be inexperienced, she fancies that it would be ill-bred. Take an example. If you kiss her lips without making any fuss about it—she bears it patiently. But if you ask leave, or tremble,— or look at her with half-shut eyes—she will never yield. Why?—in the first place, she feels that there is guiltiness in it; and in the next, she thinks, that you expect resistance. She is obliged to resist therefore, and always does resist, just as far as she imagines that you expect resistance.— If you consider it a mighty favour, she does, too. If you take it, as a rational contribution, she pays it with the same carelessness. Thus, in the childish pastime of redeeming forfeits, kisses go for nothing—gracious God! innocent lips, and soft eyes, are profaned by a succession of greasy slobbering rascals, without emotion or shame. Yet the same girls will go deadly sick at the heart, and feel themselves irretrievably dishonoured, if you should ravish a kiss from them, alone, in the dark. So true it is, that we value most things, just as we see others value them. The next matter,—I know not what to say to it. It is a false and cruel slander; but, I have heard it before, and it is my duty to put an end to it. I loved. The woman that I loved, married another. I never saw her husband. Years had passed, since I had seen her. By accident, however, I heard that she was on a visit near me. I was willing to see her—but not secretly. To the house where she dwelt, I would not go. I had said so, and kept my promise. There was one evening—one, that I knew she would remember. It was that, on which, I had always met her, whenever I met her at all. I went, on that evening, to the house of a friend. I expected her; and she came. She had been to church, but passed me on the way. She went to the church, but could not stay there. We met. I was just as composed, as self-possessed, as at this moment. I spoke to her as I was wont. Yet my voice trembled not. I took her hand for a moment; mine did not shake—but hers did. I spoke of her husband,—her child; I desired to see them both. He was not in town; and her babe, I could not see, unless she would send him where we then were; for I would not, she knew that well, set my foot within the door of the house where she dwelt. She promised to send her babe, where I desired. The next day, I went there—I found the child, and the mother. I sat with them; and was constantly in the presence of the nurse, and one or two ladies. This was our assignation! Out of that friendly and affectionate interview, during which we were not alone for a single moment, (nor have we been since her marriage,) has been fabricated a story of tremendous emphasis. It is said that we were utterly overcome;—that we wept, and perhaps embraced;—that I took her babe, and cryed over it—I!—. No, Mr. Omar, you shall judge of this passionate self abandonment; by some part of our conversation. She had beautiful hair, and eyes, dark and melancholy;—her husband's eyes and hair, and complexion were all dark and masculine. But the eyes of the child were blue, like mine;—his hair the bright colour of raw silk, and his complexion transparent. Some fool spoke of it. I felt the allusion; and, to spare her distress, immediately observed aloud, that I did not believe she loved her boy the less for his blue eyes and yellow hair. I promised, in the same tone, to adopt him. We parted. Was she imprudent? No—so entirely circumspect was she, that I never so thoroughly and heartily respected her, as then. Nay—the very evening before, when she was about to leave the house, it was altogether more convenient that she should go alone, with me; yet, she had the wisdom to insist upon another lady's going with us. She was right, our walk would have been innocent; innocent in thought, word and deed—for the truth of this, I can appeal to our Maker—but she had a husband. He might have heard af it,—and might have been disturbed. Nay—there were other reasons. I was told, and I believe it, that her husband never had heard my name pronounced; that he knew not of my love for his wife, when it was lawful to love her. There was yet something else, something that I learnt from one that knew her well, and slept with her—something that, after her marriage to another, I ought never to have known—but enough to make it wise, that we should never meet, however happy she might be, or however assured and confident I might be. Yet—we have met since—met, under circumstances, that the wicked of heart, may as easily misinterpret.— But another was with me. I met her as a friend;—my heart heaved, to be sure, for there were many deep and passionate recollections in it;—my fingers thrilled when our hands met, and the maturity and dignity of the woman had not entirely overcome the witchery and fascination of the girl.—Let her beware. She is yet in peril. And it were no light matter for such a woman, one who might have stood very loftily among women, to err, even a hair's breadth, from the inflexible line. We may never meet again. It is probable that we never shall.— But there are others, more dangerous to a proud spirit. But why dwell upon the memory of the past. It is cloudy and cold, to the eye. And I care not how soon it is forgotten.—One thing, I forgot. It is true that she did arise from her bed, to receive me. But why---I was not alone, nor was it late. But she was wearied, and had thrown herself down for a few moments, to recruit herself for the duties of a sick chamber. See how the world will torture the blessedest and sweetest movement of the heart. The next girl—how shall I speak of her? I did not love her; but, in time, I might have loved her. She was a child, inexperienced, affectionate, and so far as I could judge, from a short acquaintance, had a good mind. I treated her like a sister. I was willing to be useful to her;—and, after some conversation with her, about a course of reading, I offered to direct her in it. But— how should I proceed? She had a father, a rough, plain man, who was very dear to her, and of whom she was the idol. I wrote to him, and enclosed a letter for his daughter, desiring his permission to correspond with her. There was no mystery; nothing unfair in my thought.— I dealt plainly with him, and, as an honest man. I knew that I could be of use to his child, and I was willing to be. I told him that I should not mention love in my letters, nor attempt to be sentimental;—they should all pass through his hands; that I liked his daughter, but that before I could love her, I must know more of her. To do this, there were only two ways;—to visit her, or to correspond with her. The first I could not do;—and the latter was the surest, and most secret. I gave him references too, for his own security. The good man could not comprehend me, it seemed.— He had no idea of a rational correspondence by letter;— a conversation, on paper, between a man and woman, who had not made up their minds to be married outright.— So he told me, very plainly, that he could not understand my rigmarole;—and that, if I had any notion of addressing his daughter, I must come upon the ground. My reply was very brief. I told him, that he had misunderstood me—that I had no idea of addressing his daughter, and would not go upon the ground. It was a pity. She afterwards ran away, and married—no matter how. I never spoke to her again; and I hope that the father has never yet had reason to repent of his conduct to me.—Yet, her mother believes that she loved me, more than her husband, even when she married him. Some things have came to my knowledge, however, that I think must disturb him, at times. I have seen his daughter since---more than once---but I did not speak with her; for I had ceased to respect her. I pitied her, in my heart, and would have done much for her happiness; but there were many reasons why I should avoid her. Beside, she was afraid to meet me; I know that she was; and, much as she desired to see me, after her marriage, I know that she would have trembled from head to foot, to meet my eye; for she knew my sentiments on that subject. She had heard me reprobate these runaway matches---with no matter whom. They are never happy. The element of happiness is polluted; that confidence, which, like the pure spring water, wells out of the young heart, when it is first smitten,--- that is defiled at the source---when disobedience to a parent hath once mingled with it.---It is that infidelity, which, in its eating cruelty, causes the heartstrings to relax and decay, in silence.—It was that—that, which made Othello doubt his love. She had deceived her father—the kindest father!—What might a husband look for?---no, Omar, no. Wo, to the man that sleeps upon a pilfered heart.—It is liable to dissolve, and pass away, in a midnight vapour, at the first approach of temptation; or—if its pulse be faithful, there will be distrust; and distrust will work that, in time, which sensuality, temptation, and death, itself, might never have wrought together---an entire corruption at the core—a wish for freedom. When that wish is once felt---no matter how secretly, in the deep places of the heart, that instant there is murder and adultery there. It may perish as the body perisheth, without blossom or fruit; but---the thought hath sinned; and the flower is bloody, and polluted therewith, from that moment, as effectually, as if the man, who slept upon her chains, and sentinelled her spirit, had been strangled, sleeping, with her own hands. I say nothing of her imprudences. I know nothing of them. The world are forever busy with invention; and I have had sufficient experience already, never to depend upon any report. She is young, and if she be kindly treated, may yet make an exemplary woman— good night.”—Here we parted for a time. Thursday Evening.---I was to go to a ball this evening, dear Frank, but I am weary of dancing, and glad of an opportunity to renew the narrative of Molton. We are nearly through now.---He proceeded as follows. “My accuser is indefatigable---yet there is an air of candour in his representation, which is very imposing, I confess. The next in order, if I recollect right---but here are my minutes---yes, the next in order, is the most disgraceful affair of my whole life. Yet it shall be told; and told too, without embellishment. I found a woman, of singular power, in distress, desolate, afflicted and desperate. She told me her story. I did not believe her; but, an accident happened soon after, to make me pay attention to it; and I took some pains to discover the truth. I found that she was of an excellent family; that I knew some of her relations; and, in short, after a correspondence, into which I entered with a cousin of hers, I found so much to confirm and corroborate her story, with nothing to contradict it, that I determined to save her, if I could.—If you have the patience, I will detain you, a moment, upon her story. From her very childhood, she had been fond of her destroyer. He pursued her, until he was forbidden the house. She lived with her uncle. She had been to the wedding of a female relation, one evening; and met him, for the first time, after many weeks, while she was returning. He proposed an elopement. It were idle to repeat his arguments. Enough to say, that he prevailed; and, that she consented to make it, that very night. She returned to her uncle's. It was the custom of the family, to assign a particular lamp to each member. Hers was a little brass one. I mention these trivial incidents, because they made an impression upon me, and gave an air of circumstantial reality to her story. She was disturbed—and, when her uncle kissed her, as was his habit, and bade her good night, she took up his lamp, instead of her own, in her disorder, and ran up stairs. She was just entering her room, when she heard his voice. Yes!—he was calling to her. She could have fallen upon her face, in her terrour, and confessed the whole—for she was sure that the secret purpose of her mind, had been, in some unaccountable manner, revealed to him. She obeyed the summons. Her heart smote her; and she stood before her venerable uncle.— “Why Lucy,” said he, “thy wits must be wool-gathering.—Thee has got my lamp.” It was true. Her plan was not discovered; and she was like one restored to life. She went to bed, cheerfully, confirmed and established in her plan. When all was still, so still, that she could hear the beating of her own heart, she took her shoes in her hand, and prepared to descend. But, how was she to escape? If she passed out the front way, there was her uncle's door, always left open; and he awake, if a mouse stirred. That would not do. But the back way; she must pass through the servants' room, if she went that way. But, that way she went. She passed the sleepers on tip-toe; one awoke, and asked “who's there?” But, she hushed her heart, and held her breath, till all was quiet again—and pursued her way. She came to the bath-house; it was protected by venetian blinds. She pushed one open, and got out, and stood upon a pump. From the pump, she stepped down upon the ground. And here, she had well nigh fainted. A great dog, of which she was terribly afraid, arose and shook himself, near her; but he appeared instantly to recognize her, and lay down again, with a sullen growl. She came to the gate. It was fastened—a thing that she might have C c known—and she had not the power to unfasten it. There was a hole cut through, to let the dog out and in, however; and, through that hole, literally upon her face, she finally squeezed herself. Her lover was at hand. They ascended the carriage, and were soon beyond the reach of pursuit. Search warrants, under the state authority, were taken out; and the whole country was ransacked for her. She fell sick with terrour and fatigue. It was impossible that she could be married in that state; and it was necessary, in her timidity, that he should pass for her husband, to justify their being together; and that they should sleep, at least, in the same room, during her illness. She recovered—but her ruin was accomplished. He spoke of marriage;—but, perhaps it was fancy—she thought that his eyes contradicted his words; and she refused to marry him. They lived together. She bore him two children. But, the arrow of remorse was in her heart. She besought a reconciliation. She was accepted—returned to her home. But there was no comfort. Their very kindness was a reproach to her. Yet, she bore it;—bore the solitude of shame and desolation, for a long time, till she was insulted—insulted!—and, desperate with passion, she abjured her home, forever; and fled again, to the bosom of her destroyer. It was then, that I met her. She was delirious—beset on all sides—and ready to raise her hand against her own life. I determined to interpose. But how?— There was only one way. I must acquire an absolute dominion over her. I must make her love me—love me, better than aught in heaven, or earth. I succeeded.— But, before I tell you what were the consequences, allow me to relate one or two anecdotes. It will show you the character of her mind and temper. When quite a child, she took her little sweetheart by the hand, and journied with him, all over the city, after a man to marry them! They met an aged Friend. “Please to tell us, sir,” said she, sobbing, “where the man lives, that marries people?” The good man put them on their way, in the simplicity of his heart, without further questioning. But they were lost. It grew dark; and she and her little cousin, and her future betrayer, all nestled and cuddled together, upon some steps—and crying lustily, were found by an older cousin, who was passing, on horseback. “Why, in the name of wonder!” said he, “children, where have you come from? what are you doing?” “We have been to—to—to get ma—ma—ri—ed!” was the reply. The other anecdote follows. She lived alone, in a deserted house. A murder had been committed in the next room. She dreamt, one night, that the devil appeared at her bed side, and bade her awake, and get up; for he wanted some conversation with her. She was a good deal frightened, at first; though the devil was a handsome, gentlemanly looking fellow, enough; but he bade her be quiet; and assured her, that he had no other business, than a little chat with her. She arose, went into the next room—kindled a roaring fire; and the devil placed a chair for her, in one corner; and another, for himself, opposite. He was quite facetious, for a time. “Now, really,” said she, “I cannot believe that you are the devil. Let's see your foot;—come—up with your hoof.” He gave a sort of a whisk, and put his hoof in her lap. “Lord!—as I am alive—so it is!—Well—you are the devil, sure enough; but, after all, quite an agreeable one—so—.” “Stop—” said he.—“Do you see that brick?—mark it.” She obeyed. She took a nail, and scratched it. “Under that brick,” said the devil, “is a pot of money.—Good night.” He arose, and stood in the door-way, holding on, by the top of the door, which was partly open. The light shone on his face. It was very terrible. “In that room,” said he, “there—in that further corner—” she was afraid to look—“a man dies, every night. At twelve o'clock, I come to meet him,— It is now nearly twelve.” She awoke; a bright fire was burning, in the next room, where there was no fire, and no wood, when she went to bed!—There were the two chairs!—placed exactly as she dreamt.—She looked for the brick. It was marked with the nail;—and the watchman, that instant, cried twelve o'clock, under her window! She crept into bed, in an agony of fear. She lay there, quaking, with flashes of fire and smoke, passing before her shut eyes, continually, until day light; when she arose, and took up the brick, and dug, till the foundations of the chimney were loosened, and she expected it to fall upon her head, every moment. But, she found no money, and never slept in the house afterward. I studied her mind. I formed a plan, full of peril for her, and a matter of life and death to me. She acceded. I revealed it, distinctly, to the dearest friend that I had, on earth; but I showed her the letter. “No,” said she. “Here is my last trial. Every thing in heaven and earth, for me, depends upon this throw. I will never make it, unless with the front of innocence. If your friend know the truth, how can I meet him? He may not have the charity for me, that you have;—he may have his friend, too;—and my shame is publick, the moment that I appear. No—abandon me, if you will. I have no claim. upon you. You have saved my life, it is true; and I am ready to lay it down, at your bidding. But I will never advance a step, in this plan, unless you consent to conceal my history.” I did consent. Wo to me, that I did! I am naturally ingenuous. I hate mystery. Stratagem is my abhorrence. For all that relates to myself, I am candid to a fault. I never did that deed in my life, which I would not have avowed, openly, in the light of heaven, had I not been deterred by my regard for others. Yet, I consented to conceal the truth; nay, in carrying on this concealment—for who can say where mystery shall end, and falsehood begin—I used deception and falsehood. But why? I was not conscious of it. I had gone on, step by step, with insinuation and inuendo, until I ended in assertion. Yet this was my comfort. “I shall prevail,” said I. “I shall restore an extraordinary woman, a mother, a child, a sister, to her own respect—to happiness, and to virtue. Shall I not be forgiven, then? Will not all, that have had any hand in the work of redemption, bless me for having admitted their agency?— They will. Nay, Omar, they would. But—it failed. It failed, as every such rash project must; and no matter what I might have done, by perseverance—I thank God that I had the good sense to abandon a scheme, so fruitful in peril and disappointment. Yet, I plead guilty to it all. I deceived more than one noble heart. I abused the proudest confidence. I had well nigh broken and shattered one brain; and sent a sister, and perhaps a mother, ashamed and weeping, to their grave. For—would you believe it—it was a part of my plan, to give this helpless creature, an asylum in the mansion of my own mother; and give her, too, for her companion, the purity of my own sister. It was well that I did not;—it would have killed them. Yet, let me do her justice. It was no fault of mine, that all this did not happen. My plans were matured—my promises made—and I put the question fairly to her, without flinching. She determined wisely. “No,” said she, “I cannot enter the house of innocence— I cannot pollute the abiding place of purity and affection. Henceforth I have done with all this dreaming. You have abandoned me. I expected it. You have not deceived me. You told me exactly what you would do; what you could do; and you have done all that you promised, like a man, without flinching. God will reward you for it. I have been slandered—but I was innocent. I long to meet you once more—to throw myself into your arms—to weep away, forever, it may be, the shame and oppression that I feel at the heart;—but why should I wish it? I have been too long a burden to you. I will be so no longer. I will return in the path that you have opened for me. I will go to my home. I will become penitent and humble; and, perhaps, as you have so kindly said, and so often, too, perhaps—God will forgive me, and I may yet die in peace, supported upon the bosom of a child, whose mother was forgiven for her love of that child. Farewell!” Omar, you see the extent of my indiscretion. I do not pretend to justify, or to palliate it. I only say, that, when I sinned, my heart did not reproach me. There was no deliberate wickedness in my disposition. But, I was a fool. I was blotting and smearing my own senses— dashing the perfumed censer—and shattering the pictured vase of the imagination;—profaning the loveliness, C c 2 and mystery, and enchantment of passion. Yet, I did not love, then. Had I loved—righteous God!—as soon would I have rolled with the festering leper---fed, and drunk, and slept, in poison, and death, and rottenness, as permit aught of impurity, to come near my heart.— That has always been my temper---always will be. I had not even the plea of passion or habitude, in my favour. No---my mind was above such things. I hated and loathed the wanton. There were high and holy places in my thought, upon which nothing of earth, and such earth, least of all, had ever trod;---places, within my heart, where no unclean thing had ever nestled. There are such places, yet---untrodden, but by God---unvisited, but by angels. There have I enshrined the woman that I love. Darkness may be there, and silence---but there is no licentiousness---no sensuality. Yes---although it is not true that I have pursued any woman, steadily, for a time; or any one, without success, or without obtaining what I sought---yet, it is true, that one had the spirit, the heroism, to trample upon my power, even in its excess. Peace be to her bosom! It was a gentle one. She was unwise; but her meaning was wisdom;---and she plucked out my image, from her gentle heart, like a cancer, by the roots. Is it wonderful that her bosom is bleeding and sore yet? No!---and to the last breath that she draws, it will bleed, with every sob, and every swell. Do I not grieve for her? I do, for she was the only woman that I had ever truly loved. I observe your eyes. I make no exception;---and I reveal not her name. I leave you to imagine who it may be; but I leave it to your imagination alone. You will never know aught from me. I shall never mention her again. Yes, I loved her. I put myself in her power. She might have used it more gently, for I have a proud heart, Omar; and it well nigh sunders, when jarred unkindly, by one that it beats gently for. My voice trembles—I am aware of it—and the light of the candle dashes athwart my eyes, unpleasantly—perhaps they are wet. It may be—but it is for the last time. I loved that woman. I would have made her happy. I could—happier than any man, upon this earth. But that hour is past now. I could weep for her;—the loss is hers. It is irreparable. Had she dared to be my wife, she would never have had reason to lament it; but—let us leave the subject. She is a noble creature, and I wish her all the happiness in the world; yet, my heart is heavy, when I think of her. Married or unmarried, desolate she must be, for she is learning, every hour, that I told her the truth, and that I was mightily dealt with, for one so haughty and devoted. But who is she, with whom I now live? It is my wife. I have no further answer. Let that question pass, then. Yes, it is true. A young, and, I believe, innocent creature, did put herself into my way, with tears. I did not betray her. Yet I might. I did not debauch her; yet I did wrong her; for I trifled with the hidden tenderness of her heart. I am sorry for it. I wrought there, more foully, more wickedly, more like a determined and experienced scoundrel, than in any other case. Yet, when she was utterly mine, I forbore. I deserve no praise for this. It is no praise to forbear from blood, after pilfering, to excess. There is no merit in withholding the blow of death, when but one blow is wanted, for the consummation. The story of the nunnery; and of my being shot by the brother of one, whom I had betrayed, is a lie. Yet, it is a lie of my own coining. It arose out of a simple frolick; but it continued, constantly augmenting in seriousness, till I told a deliberate falsehood to support it. The whole of that story is a fabrication. The next is a singular affair—to this moment an unaccountable one to me. I was on a friendly and familiar footing with an intelligent woman. It had continued for some time. I met her, as usual, one evening. I saw no change, nor shadow of change; but, the next day, I received the following note:— “Since we last met, circumstances of a peculiar character have occurred, that render thy future visits improper. Do not ask me why;—but be assured (that) I shall ever remember, with interest, our past acquaintance.” “Oblige me by not acquainting S, or any one else, with the contents of this.” There, Mr. Omar, you now know as much of this mysterious affair, as I, myself, know. I dare not even conjecture the cause; yet, that there is one, and an efficient one, I can readily believe; for she was a prudent, sensible, and high-minded woman. There is one thought, and one alone, which lies buried in my heart, that would seem to throw some light upon the matter. But that thought is for no other eye, than my Maker's---not even for hers. It is, possibly, the true one. I replied to her note. I asked no questions. I only appealed to her generosity. If I were slandered, it was her duty, if it were proper, to hear my defence. We have never met, since. I shall always respect her—always; and I am sure that she can never cease to respect me. Her name is not to he told; nor would I mention aught of the circumstance, were it not that, my own conduct may appear capricious and unaccountable to some that know me. I was intimate in the family. I suddenly ceased to see, or speak to them. This ought to be accounted for. Yes, it is also true that I have been the cause of jealousy and uneasiness to more than one married bosom;— but, on what ground, as heaven is my witness, I cannot conjecture. For myself, in one, and the strongest case, I can aver, that I did not even suspect that any human being could be jealous of me. It came upon me, like a thunderclap, at last; and I put myself, instantly, beyond all suspicion. Mr. Omar—I have made more than one such sacrifice in my time, to the idle and wicked terrour of husbands. More than one woman, that was dear to me, as a friend, almost as a sister;—more than one, with whom the extent of my familiarity, was a shake of the hand—have I abandoned, merely in complaisance to the boyish jealousy of some husband. How little they knew me! Their safety was in my principles—in my heart;— not in distance, absence, or coldness. But, it was my duty to have compassion on their infirmities; and I obeyed the impulse. But, believe me, there never was a man more innocent of unlawful acquaintance, with the forbidden property of another. I have poisoned no wife's affection—breathed upon no wedded lips—(at least, not to my knowledge)—no!—but I have always reverenced both, however unworthily assorted they might be; however my heart might beat, or my eyes ache, for the unnatural intercourse that I have seen, between intellect and earth—spirituality and appetite. Yet, I have seen such things, and lamented them; but it was not for me to reform—what?—the abuses of heaven! Judge you of my truth. There are three or four letters from a woman, whom I knew abroad. We were passengers in the same ship—inhabitants of the same boarding house, for a time. I loved her, as a sister. She was unkindly treated. I taught her fortitude, forbearance, resignation. My dealing with her was sincere and high. If she hath been troubled in spirit, it was no fault of mine. I did all that a brother could have done, to soothe and sustain her. There is one, to whom these things, that I now tell you, if she heard them, would approach with a power that will appal her. Let her be faithful to the high and holy confidence, that I have shown in her. To her, alone, is the secret entrusted. She will understand me. The secret is in her keeping; and while her noble heart hath life in it, I need not implore her silence. Heaven bless her, forever and ever. May she sleep quietly, when I am no more. That is all my prayer for her. But, for the letters. There they are;---read them. They are all; and they are very precious to me.” As he concluded, he gave them to me. I will transcribe them for you, Frank, in order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER TO MOLTON. “Yes, I will, I must, tell you all (that) I suffer. I know (that) it is not idle curiosity which prompts you to make the inquiry; and, believe me, the lively interest which you have manifested, is felt, with warmth and gratitude.— But I dare not trust myself to tell you, how much I thank you. The voice of friendship or kindness, is irresistible to me---always was; but, of late, I have been a stranger to it. I must not listen to it, now. It only aggravates my suffering, and renders my situation still more intolerable. You must not, therefore, discover any degree of sympathy for me; but I shall always believe that you feel it; and even that will be a comfort to me, through life. You see how I am watched, on all sides---an object of jealousy and distrust, to those by whom I am surrounded. Feeling and sensibility are alike strangers to them. They cannot, therefore, understand the nature of your sentiments, noble and generous as they are. I cannot describe to you, the pang that I felt, when I discovered that he was a slave to that most degrading vice. My heart died within me; for I well knew that it would be incurable;—and I knew it to be the source of every misery in life. Oh, I thought that I could have borne anything but that---so humiliating!---To be the wife of a man, and the mother of his children, who will You have often seen me look troubled. Can you wonder at it? Indeed, I wonder at myself, that I can ever look otherwise. But, according to the old adage, the back is often fitted to the burden—and I believe it; for, many would have sunk under what I have endured. But it has undermined my constitution, and brought me to the brink of the grave. Had it not been for the watchful care, and kind attention of Harriot, I do not believe that I should have been alive at this moment. I have been on the eve of separation from him, half a dozen times; but my poor deserted child always arose to my view, and prevented it. For his sake, I have made every sacrifice. My days have been murdered. I was formed for domestick happiness; but how little of it have I known! Since we were married, he has never spent a single evening at home, unless we had company. For me, he has not one sentiment of affection, I verily believe; nay, I cannot persuade myself that he ever had, or he could not treat me with such continual neglect. After my return from prayer-meeting, last night, he abused me most bitterly, and was on the point of turning me out of doors;---swearing that if ever went again, I should never enter a house of his. Such is the effect of a violent temper, which terrifies me to death, whenever it breaks out. His estates are neglected; his intellectual powers destroyed; his constitution impaired; and his reputation irretrievably injured. All this have I foretold to him, time after time, until, at length, I have given it up, entirely. I feel that I have a double duty to discharge, and a most imperious one. May God, in his infinite mercy, give me strength equal to the task! He has treated me better since the passage, than he ever did before. You were the first that ever taught him to set any value on my opinion. * * * * I have now spoken to you, as I would, to a dear brother; and, as you would guard the honour of a sister, I entreat you to confine what I have said, to your own bosom. Never breathe it to mortal, as you value my friendship. Let me continue to be thought, by the world, a happy wife. But, O, there is no happiness for me on this side of the grave. How have the tenderest affections of my heart been paralysed!---my hopes---how have they been blighted!---laid prostrate before that sceptre, to which we must all bow—but enough—Let me once more beg of you, that you will commit this to the flames, the moment that you have read it. It abounds with errour, and, if I trust myself to read it over, I know that I shall never send it. May heaven bless you, and gather you into its own fold, at last, is the sincere prayer of, CATHARINE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The second is as follows: You are certainly a most wonderful being! How is it that you can explore the secret recesses of my heart with such accuracy? I have been wishing to speak to you on the subject of your letters, but never could get an opportunity. That person whom you have pictured from your own imagination, was, indeed, all that you suppose. He, like you, could read every emotion of my soul, by looking in my face. He had all your enthusiasm; all your warm, impetuous, generous feeling, but none of your levity or infidelity. Add to this, that he was the companion of my childhood, from earliest years; and you will not be surprised that I felt for him,—more than I can describe. That I lament his death, and ever shall, is most certain, although I fear that I commit a sin by doing so. Yet I cannot help it. With regard to your advice, I will try to profit by it, so far as I shall consider it my duty; and so far as it is consistent with sincerity But I never can act the hypocrite. I can avoid dispute, it is true, by being silent; but, to practise the arts of the most abandoned of my sex—never—never!—You do not know me yet, if you think me capable of deceit. No —I am resigned to my fate, if it be even to drag out the remainder of my life, without loving or being beloved, by any human being. You ask me if you had not better abandon the house? I am selfish enough to say no; but, if you can be happier any where else —I answer yes, yes, by all means. Although it would grieve me to part with you,—pain me not to meet you as I have been accustomed to, now and then, in this cold world, yet I entreat that you will make no sacrifice on my account. This is the last time that you will see the trace of my pen—unless something unforeseen should occur. I have been guilty of a very great imprudence. Farewell—I feel vexed with myself—but when I see you, and attempt to speak, I never can say what I would. May you be as happy as I wish you, in time and in eternity! * * * Bristol, (R. I.) Sept. —.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been here nearly three weeks; and have not seen a line from any one at home, with the exception of a few words from my poor cousin. Am I not treated with the most unparalleled neglect and cruelty? Had I searched the world over, I could not have met with another being so unkind. I have written letter after letter to him; but they all remain unanswered. Nay—he told me when I left home, if I did not receive the money from the estate—never to return to him; for he would never see me again. I do sincerely believe, that it is his wish that I never should. I have only to submit to it a little longer. I left home with reluctance, more especially, as I had not seen you, my only friend, for so long a time. My own feelings warrant me in claiming your friendship; for I feel for you a sentiment the most pure and exalted; a sentiment that neither time nor absence can alter or diminish. It is founded upon the most imperishable basis—that of gratitude; and strengthened and confirmed by a thorough and intimate acquaintance with your heart and character. I have received much attention here. There are several genteel families about; and I have had invitations for every day in the week. My health is much better than it has been for a long time, notwithstanding the fatigue of the journey. And, after a while, I shall be able to enjoy myself, I hope, if that can be called enjoyment, in which the heart has no share. We had a delightful excursion, lately, to a mountain in this neighbourhood. It commands a beautiful and extensive prospect. But I thought, while I stood upon it, how much its beauty would have been enhanced, had you been near me. I think of you every day, and almost every hour in the day. I am interested in every thing which relates to you; and even Mr. Stonebridge does not pray with more sincerity for your happiness, than I do. Poor Mary!—you think that she will be unhappy. Heaven forbid. Were she my child, dear as she would be to my lone heart, I would follow her cheerfully to the grave, rather than her fate should resemble mine. But I will not think of it. My suffering hath taught me to fix my hope upon somewhat less fleeting than earthly enjoyment. I am ashamed to send this scrawl; but it has been written in such a hurry—you must excuse it. * * * * D d The next, in order, my dear brother, is the following: I have once ventured to ask Molton the name of the woman;—but he silenced me, forever. I shall never dare to repeat the question. “Can it be possible, my beloved friend and brother!— Are you indeed about to forsake us. This is an unforeseen event, truly. But I have suspected it, more than once, during your last visits, from your countenance. Yes—I was sure that you had something of the kind in contemplation. I am not at all surprised at it. Your feelings have been too often put to the trial; and your sympathizing heart cannot bear to witness any longer, the suffering of one, for whom you have professed, and for whom, I believe, you truly feel, a friendship. Dear and sacred will be the memory of that friendship to my heart—I cannot tell you how I feel—I have wet the paper with my tears. I cannot bear to write farewell. May I ask you sometimes to think of me; and, when I am gone to another, and a better world, will you look upon my poor boy, and be a friend to him;—upon my babe, if it survive me, and bless it. I shall not be long here. It is impossible that I can wear much longer in this way. But while I do live, my prayer shall be offered up for your prosperity and happiness, both here and hereafter. May we meet in heaven! Farewell, once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE LAST. I have just read the manuscript that you left with me, and thank you, in sincerity of heart, for this mark of your continued esteem and confidence. I rejoice that you have been able to extricate Mr. S. How he must have felt! Situated as he is, I do sincerely hope that this may be the termination of all his difficulties, and all his sufferings. I have much to say to you, my dear friend, of my own concerns. I feel a melancholy gratification in making you acquainted with all my trial and trouble. No human being knows of them except yourself. You have seen me appear cheerful and happy, since my return,—to the world I mean. But O, how different have been my real feelings!—I have been abused, O, so bitterly, so shamefully—* * * * * * Never before has there been such indifference, such unkindness, so unprovoked, so deliberate and habitual, shown to me. During my absence, I never received a line;—and a letter from one that was dear to me— You see what an opinion that friend has of my married state—she is my relation,—but I would not have her know, for the world, what I suffer. I cannot bear to be pitied. * * * * * You seem to think that I have enjoyed some happy hours since my ill-fated marriage. Never—never; unless it be from the happiness that my dear little ones have afforded me. I have never known any other. My life has been a continual martyrdom. Not an hour have I known, when my heart could approve of his conduct. Our minds, and pursuits, and feelings, and sentiments, are diametrically opposite. But this heartless indifference is even worse than hatred. Yet I am now determined to bear up against it all, and not suffer it to make such an impression on me, as it has done—heretofore. I feel that I shall be supported through it all; for the All-wise Disposer of events never lays more upon us, than we are able to bear. While you visited us, I lived comparatively happy. The respect and attention, with which you invariably treated me, made a transient impression on him; but it soon passed away. Do not write to me— I charge you. This requires no answer. It is written on the spur of the moment, after having read the manuscript; beside, there is a fascination in your writing, which I do not wish to feel. I try to banish you from my mind, as much as possible. This, you will say is kind—but it is the simple truth, and I cannot tell you anything else. Farewell.” There, my dear brother—the whole of his life is now before you. What think you of Molton, now? Yours, brother, heart and soul. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JULIET TO SARAH. O bless you, Sarah, bless you!—I accept your offer, with a full heart and overflowing eyes. O, you know not what you have saved me from,—but I cannot tell you, I dare not---I only say that I am ready to lie down upon my bed, and weep till the hour of our meeting. When shall it be?----I am not impatient, not very impatient, dear Sarah----but let it be as soon as possible. Can I not join you? It may be a long time before you return to New York;----and, in the mean time—But no! that were unworthy of me. I will await your own good time. Sarah---I wish that you could see me;---my hand shakes with a strange convulsion; and, just now, when I arose to tie up my hair, which had fallen over my face, and blinded me, I was struck with the change in my own countenance. What does it portend?---Am I to be happy yet!----O, righteous heaven, pity me; have compassion on me!----else may kindness do, what suffering-humilation,----the approach of death has left undone--- make me forget thee. Sarah, I cannot write intelligibly--- farewell:---heaven bless thee----do not omit an opportunity to write to me, do not----you can have no idea what a sweet consolation it is to me—Stay, I have read this over. I have half a mind to tear it: yet something must be said; and, if I trust my heart to tell its gratitude, there is no knowing how unwise and pestilent a babbler it may become.----So----go it must; but remember, I do not complain. I betray no one----I accuse no one. I only say that I am unhappy----very, very unhappy; and that, the sooner I am in the arms of my own dear Sarah, the sooner I shall be happy.---Farewell----farewell!--- The route to Quebec will be delightful---Ah, I wish that I were with you.---- JULIET.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SARAH TO JULIET. I promised to continue my journal. Lo! here it is—I copy it, just as it was written, with all my pencil annotations, on the road. Portsmouth ferry—What a beautiful river!—and what multitudes of fish. The name, too is remarkable, and would indicate a strange affinity, between the Latin, and the Indian tongues. Wrong—the Latin is a language, the Indian a tongue—a tongue is a dialect—a dialect is a—it is called Piscataqua—that was the original name too. The Indians say, that, it is, in their language, the water of fish. It is so in Latin. But there are other instances, I am told, of the same kind. The current is very strong; and we cross in a wide curve. There is a navy-yard in sight, where, I am told they are building some three-deckers. We are now in old Massachusetts again. This town is Wells. But what can I say of it? Nothing. Kennebunk.—A pretty place, with an air of bustle and impatience, that pleases me. The tavern keeper, with his surly good humour, good face, and gouty feet, is quite an oddity. On the whole, there is an air of picturesqueness here, that strikes me. Saco.—We are now approaching the capital of the new state, that is to be. This is a marvellous, neat, snug cluster of habitations. The houses are of board, (frame, as we call them) wooden they are called here—and painted, chiefly white;which has a lively, bright air, when contrasted with the deep green of the turf and trees about, and the clear blue sky. There is, I am told, a good deal of fashion and gentility here; and I dare say that it is true. For I have always observed that, in these little towns, there is (bating their scandal, which is less in quantity, and sharper in quality, than with us)—a general fondness for convivial, sociable intercourse. Having more leisure —and being few in number, they huddle together, without much etiquette; and therefore, soon learn, all but the parade of fashion, by learning to be agreeable. Have you ever been in a country ball room? Did you never observe D d 2 the striking difference between the gentility of the men, and that of the women? With the exception of the village lawyer, a doctor perhaps, and some young shopkeeper, the beaux are always rough-hewn, awkward creatures, who scarcely know how to sit in their chair;— and dance, generally, in purple gloves, that discharge their dye, like a steeped poppy,—so stiff in the fingers too, that few can succeed in shutting the hand. They are like an iron gauntlet, without joints;—while the women are really well bred and almost fashionable. Whence is the difference? I have asked Frank. He is running over at the eyes, with pleasure;—half crazy, I believe, with one adventure after another. He says that there is less difference in the employments, of women, than in those of men. The woman of the village, and the lady of the city, spend their time chiefly in the house.— But with the men, it is widely different. In the country they are exposed night and day, to toil, and wind and rain. Voila la difference. This has been a great place for the lumber trade.— You know what that is. It is the place of a hundred mills;—but there has just happened a tremendous rise of the river. It is all white and roaring, at this moment— and the bridges are all carried away—and many mills; and, as far as the eye can see, the water is covered with pine logs, tumbling and pitching about, in their way to the ocean, with here and there, a little boat dancing like a cork in the foam,—carrying some men, who are busy in picking up their stray lumber. It is very perilous, I am told—Ah!— At that moment, a boat upset, in sight of my window; but no lives are lost. The poor creatures are just landed, almost under where I sit. Our house is full, uncomfortably full; for, all the travellers are stopped—each way; and, it is with the greatest difficulty that the mail is sent across. Such swells and inundations are called freshets. They are caused by great rains—in the up country; melting of the snows; and breaking up of the ice. Portland—Well—here we are, at last, in one of the most delightful places, I verily believe, to be found in the world. The weather is charming; and we have just returned from a walk, to what they call the Observatory. It is a tall red tower, built of pine, to be sure, with a fine telescope at the top. It stands on a high hill, from which you look down upon the coloured roofs of innumerable houses, mingled with innumerable trees. It is a beautiful fashion they have here, of planting trees, along the streets, and putting every house into a bed of foliage. It cools the air, and consumes that part of it which is pernicious to animal life; purifies it; gives shadow and beauty to the whole town; and has the pretty effect of making it appear three times as large as it is. Portland is quite an amphitheatre, from the water. There is a spacious bay in front of us—the bluest water in the world—all covered over with little islets, that look like spots of green turf; and all along the horizon, on one side, is a line of irregular green—like surging emerald, over which the white dazzling spray dashes, incessantly; it is like an embankment of moss—drifting up. There is a light-house—and there are two neatly constructed forts. Just behind it, is another, that was built during our revolutionary war. Before us, on the hill, a heavy, but ruinous battery, bearing evident marks of having been visited by the enemy, in other days; the guns are broken and dismounted, and the intrenchments levelled. Just below, however, almost on a level with the water, is a formidable battery, recently constructed, in consequence, I am told, of a threat made by the British commander on the station, to enter, and cut out the Enterprize and Boxer; for, it was into this port, that she brought her prize, says a gentleman that is with us, a fidgetty, active, good natured, good-for-nothing sort of a man, as I am used to call just such another one of your acquaintance, to whom the Emperour Alexander once sent a ring: O, by the way, did you ever hear the reason? It was admirable;—a genuine “yankee trick.” He first sent the Emperour a copy of the life of the Czar Alexander of Russia, magnificently bound, written and printed in England!---a matter which might have cost three or four dollars. In return for which, could the Emperour do less? The Emperour sent him a ring, about the size of a shoe buckle, in which a couple of hundred bits of broken diamonds, are so managed, as to dazzle and blind many a beautiful pair of eyes, that have attempted to count them. Gracious! who knows but the Emperour may have had that very ring upon his imperial finger---taken snuff in it, perhaps!---O,---it reminded me of Henry fourth, and his turnip,---so good a bargain. But let me return, if I can, to the subject. Our guide was amazingly like him---extremely polite, on account of our appearance, I suppose---for, while he was with us, he appeared neither to hear nor see any body else. He had been every where; and seen every thing; and talked incessantly, with his hat in his hand. He was the first on board of the Boxer, after the battle. It was fought, almost within sight of him. Her deck was covered with blood and brains---the scuppers were running yet; and he saw two men shake hands, who had been aiming and firing at each other, for twenty minutes, during the battle. Each had killed or wounded every body about the other; and the last shot that was fired, struck a man in the mouth that stood by the side of him. The mast was full of balls, too. “But how did you manage to fire so much faster than I?” said the Briton. “I'll tell you,” said the American. “O, it was a neat thing;—my mess mate, in the fore-top, was wounded—so he lay down, and bit off the ends of the cartrages; and primed for me, while I loaded.” This has been a place of great busines; but a series of misfortunes and disorders, had reduced it, exceedingly. Of late, it has taken a new start; a monkish superstition has given way to the rational dominion of festivity; business has a wakened; rash and adventurous speculation is done with; and things have settled down, into a substantial and healthful tranquillity. People are contented now, with moderate and certain profits, in their business; and there is an air of comfort and good sense about them, that I love to meet with. Some religious factions have existed, they say—and I am promised an introduction to[8] [8] Ah, the secret is out! This courteous gentleman had heard of my poor father's respectability.—How amiable and disinterested. the two rival chiefs. One, I am told, is a mild, gentle creature, with a heart overflowing in benevolence and sincerity; the other, equally sincere, but more ambitious, and tremendously austere. The last prevailed for a term, and darkened all the habitations of enjoyment. But the reign of the other is now established; and things go on pleasantly, rationally, and with a sufficient degree of solemnity, even for a religious people. This town was burnt, during the revolution, in a most cruel, and wanton manner, by a wretch, whose name they will not pronounce, even in execration, lest he should be remembered; and I have just trodden upon the ground, where Sullivan says that a sort of Indian battle was once fought, many years before the Revolution. Monday Evening.—I have been unable to write till now. The women are very beautiful here; and some singularly intelligent—but the men—they are so---so. I speak of the young men; for, with two or three exceptions, they have proved a very tame, insipid, spiritless set to me. They affect to admire me; but there is no character in their admiration. I had rather have a blunt fellow wring my hand, till the blood spirts out of the nail---in sincerity, than listen, forever, to the chattering of these magpies, however pleased they may really be with me. But I lately spent an evening here in a society of women, who would have done honour, to any city in the world. Indeed, I never saw so many truly fine women assembled together before. I saw a great deal of plain unaffected good sense; and really very little pretension, or prettiness, or affectation.—It is true, that they look much younger to a southern eye, than they really are; for, a woman of two or three and twenty, here, looks more fresh and youthful, than many of sixteen or seventeen with us. And I have made an acquaintance with one who astonished me, by telling her age, the moment that I alluded to her appearance, without the slightest expression, either of concern or candour. She was twenty-seven!—Juliet!—she does not look so old as your humble servant. Twenty-seven!—upon my word, I have a prodigious fancy to know, how I shall feel and look when I am twenty-seven. Saturday we had a sort of a water party, to see the forts—and eat chowder. That is no laughing matter, here, I assure you. A large fish is caught, if possible;— if not, many small ones—and soused in, head and ears, into a large kettle of water,—into which, biscuit, and herbs, and one thing and another are put, until the whole makes (with a plenty of pepper) a thick, indescribable dish, which I really found quite palatable. This, you will observe, is cooked in the open air—and by the beaux, with whom it is a matter of no little jealousy and competition. We had some tolerable singing—and were politely treated, at the forts—but we were well nigh getting most nobly ducked, if not something worse, on our disembarkation; and returned, drenched, wet, and cold, and weary. But that is a part of the amusement. It would hardly be thought a water-party, else. Frank is half frantick. The admiration of the women, by the way, is not very equivocally expressed;—but that we must forget, when we recollect that the males have all burrowed abroad—or scampered off; and that a good fellow is no light matter among such a multitude of unmarried women.—But, Frank says, he would not mind a sleigh-ride in such company! You, have heard him describe one that he had—a ball—cold rooms—cold feet— cold supper—cold sickness at the stomach—cold giddiness of the head—returning late—no fire—and going into a bed, cold as a snow drift, with feet—feeling as if they belonged to—anybody but the owner. Bath—Brunswick.—We are now at Bath. We passed through several pleasant places on our route; the last of which was Brunswick. Here is the Bowdoin College; a very respectable institution. I met a Mr. Cleveland there, who, Frank says, is a man of uncommon science, as a mineralogist, geologist, and conchologist—(I believe these are the names;)—that he has published a book, which is the established text book, in the science, at some of the universities of Europe. I liked the man. His manner was plain and unpretending. He showed us a respectable cabinet, and some decent pictures;—in return for which, happening to hear him ask Frank, if if he had any acquaintance with German, I played off, very adroitly, I assure you, some of my scholarship. I begged, modestly, like the red coat, before Pope, (for, I confess, I thought of him, at the time,) to be permitted to look at the passage. I was able to explain it. And, I thought, if ever the poor man had kissed any woman but his wife, that he would have jumped into my arms. His dark, manly eyes, sparkled fire. He was a beginner, he said—and had never heard it pronounced. I read two or three sentences—and we parted. What should you say, to my learning chymistry? I assure you, that it is considered, here, quite a common thing, for a lady. Mr. C. has made it popular and fashionable;—he is an admirable lecturer, and lectures every season, to ladies. This town is built on a perfect level—and is remarkable, I dare say, for nothing. There are a great number of saw mills—some students—plenty of pigeons; and, what they call, huckleberries—(whortleberries, I suppose.) Bath is a small, but very pleasant town. I am quite pleased with it. Here lives the brother of our Rufus King; an ambitious, strong-minded, awkward, unprincipled, ignorant man, with considerable talent for intrigue—and military talent enough, to construct a redoubt, lately, of pine-timber—the splinters of which, when struck by a ball, would infallibly have done ten times the mischief, that the ball would, if it struck a whole platoon. So, says a mischievous fellow, here, who seems to delight in caricaturing, with a great air of pleasantry, whatever passes through his mind. Wiscasset.—Here we are, at last, half dead with fatigue, over the vilest road in the world. With this little place, I am delighted. I shall never think of it, but with affection. I am greeted and welcomed here, with that cordiality, which we give to relations. I shall stay some days here. Thursday.—I am about to depart. I have made some pleasant acquaintances; among others, a clergyman now here on a visit;—a very extraordinary man. He is settled in Bath; but they are about to lose him, as he cannot make up his mind to downright starvation. He is a scholar, a gentleman, and a christian. There is a Boston lady here, too—a Miss R—, with whom I should be proud and pleased to renew my acquaintance. But how unlikely it is!—alas, my dear Juliet, it is a melancholy thought—to part smilingly, and forever!---I cannot bear it. It were better, I think sometimes, that we had never met. I have found a sweet little creature here, too; who, I am afraid, is about to be married. I shall never forget Wiscasset, or its hearty, hospitable, intelligent, and polite people. Waterville.--“The pleasantest village in the world!” said Frank, the moment that we entered it. We are now within eighty miles, I am told, of Quebec, in a right line. Indeed, it is a beautiful place—a few neat dwellings; and all so happy and rural. Frank has just returned. Would you believe it—we are close at home.— Here—here, within a stone's throw, lives my beloved aunt! O, I do feel happy. I must run to her. Evening.—I am happy, Juliet—once more, I am really happy. My dear aunt knew me, immediately. She wept—and fainted. I knew her character—I expected it. She is a noble-looking woman; but sorrow and disappointment have broken her down. She says that my resemblance to my mother is striking. I can scarcely remember her. She was the younger sister, it appears; but no more at present. I am happy. Frank appears very cloudy and distressed, of late. For two or three days, he has been remarkably silent—and I have caught his eyes dwelling upon me, sometimes, with a singular expression. When I say, “What is the matter, cousin?—you frighten me.” He attempts to smile—“Be of good heart, dear Sarah,” he says—“all will go right— I have only recovered my senses.” Well, well—I will not trouble myself about it. It was natural—these artificial spirits of his have passed off—and languor and depression are the natural consequences. Yet, somehow, I do feel a little cold about the heart, as if some other calamity—what, I know not—were near to me. Perhaps he is out of temper. He has been inconceivably annoyed, in all directions, on this road. He has been repeatedly gazed at, followed, and questioned, as general Ripley. I never saw the general; but, the resemblance must be very extraordinary, indeed, to be observed here; for, we are told, that he once lived in this village, and practised law for some time. Frank is not so tall, nor so old; and beside that, he has very handsome teeth, while the front ones of the general are gone. Yet, nevertheless, when sitting, he has been addressed as general, by persons that knew him well. Even their voices are alike. I forgot to describe Hallowell and Augusta, two towns upon the Kennebeck; or, rather, we passed through them so rapidly, that I had no time. I am told, however, that the people are active, polite, and kind to strangers; and the situation and appearance of both towns are very pleasant. I should like to reside in them, awhile, I think. Ah, Sarah.—Frank has just left me. The mystery is explained. He brought an open letter in his hand. He sat down by me.—He prepared me—but his heart was full, and his hand shook the while—for what I was to expect. My father was a bankrupt. Does it shock you, Juliet. I know not why—it may be apathy in me—it may be, that my sensibility is deadened by recent suffering—it may be, that I do not yet know the value of what I have lost—but, at this moment, Juliet,—if thou wert near me, I would bid thee lay thy hand upon my heart—It aches not. It is neither colder nor warmer--- more nor less hurried, or agitated, than before. Perhaps it is that I expected something more terrible.----I did---I know not what---but this certainty, is really a relief to me. I shall send this, immediately. I shall now abandon all thought of Quebec. Frank will leave me here, awhile, and return to look into the estate. It may not be so bad, as we fear;—but, in the mean time, my sweet Juliet will believe me, when I say, that my only sorrow is— that I have no longer a habitation for her.—Perhaps you have received my letter —perhaps!—Oh! that I could pray that you may not. May it miscarry!—if the E e offer were never made—never accepted—the disappointment will be less cruel.—Heaven only knows when we shall meet, now.—Farewell! farewell!— SARAH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO SARAH. Let me entreat you, dear Sarah, to make Juliet leave Jane and the family, without losing a day. I have my reasons. I have just left her. I have had a mortal quarrel with Jane.—I will never set my foot within her door again. But what will become of Juliet?—O save her! save her!—Does Grenville wrong her?—By heaven, Sarah, I will see him—see him, immediately; and, if that blessed creature hath aught to complain of from him—I know not what I am writing.---He is constantly there—and just now, when I entered unexpectedly, Juliet was weeping----and Jane stood near her, her countenance inflamed with passion. What does it mean? There was that devil of a Matilda, too----her arms crossed so meekly upon her lap,—and hell and death about her eyes and lips---Offer Juliet your home immediately--- immediately! there is not a moment to lose. JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">JOHN TO FRANK. Annapolis, Md. — Frank!---Frank!---Lock your hands upon your heart--- go down upon your knees. It is true after all----true.--- William was murdered. Yes!----and Edward Molton was the murderer. Lord, God! what a complication of horrour and crime has been revealed to me. Now listen.----Last evening, I had been to Jane's. Something that I saw, displeased me; and I left the house in wrath. I came here, and scribbled a line or two to Sarah---for God's sake, Frank, do you enforce it---send for Juliet---Let not a day---not an hour pass---I will go for her----I will tear her away, by force----sword in hand---from the devils that beset her. I went to Molton's. It was moonlight. He proposed a walk;---and the temperature of the evening was so soft and pleasant, that his physician consented; and we wandered together for more than two hours. I never heard Molton's true voice before. I never before saw him in such a temper. God!—he underwent a transfiguration before my very eyes---he walked out, in spirit, like an archangel. I was uplifted, awed and borne away, by his great eloquence. It was unearthly—the deep, deep utterance of an acquitted, anointed rebel. It grew dark; and we returned by a way that was unfrequented. The wind rose; and, at last, Molton himself confessed, that he knew not where we were—at this moment. I thought that I could perceive a ruined building near—I was right. It was so—and a part of our own tenement. I was amused, when I discovered the truth, for it had never appeared to me before as it did then. I had been bewildered, and had never approached it before, on the same side. We entered, and were advancing with outstretched hands, when Molton suddenly caught my arm. My blood retreated. He breathed like one, at his last gasp—but not a sound escaped from his lips. He stopped—put his hand to his forehead—and disappeared. A moment after, he returned—he took my hand. His own was cold as death. He appeared to have made some discovery. His track was like an Indian upon the scent of his prey. His eyes flashed---I could see them sparkle, though it was very dark. He compelled me to follow him, by main force; and I did, along by the broken wall---to a green spot---where the great oak stands;---he paused there, for a moment---and stood like one, trying to recall some forgotten thing---- but then a sudden recollection seemed to strike him. Some sound, I know not what, escaped between his set teeth; and he dashed through the shrubbery. I thought that he was mad, but I followed him---he struck the doors aside--- one after the other, while he passed on, as with an iron arm; and he jarred the whole house with his tread. At last, we stood in the centre of my own room. “By the everlasting God!” he oried, then----“This accounts for it! Yes---yes!--there is the very closet!--that the door---there--fool!---madman!---why did I not suspect the truth?---Those spots of blood!---smoking, absolutely smoking under my nostrils—the whole house quivering with the unbidden presence!—mortal spasms, affecting even material things!---My sleep broken---my senses disordered---my heart crumbling---and yet,---the truth---the truth never suspected, before! John Omar—come here--- here! There—place your foot there!---a little more this way. Look at me---can you see my face?---Look at me, and listen. You are standing on blood. What blood?--- blood, shed by this hand---this?---whose?---the blood of your cousin William! What! do you stagger! are you not ashamed? Look at me---behold—Lo! I set my foot upon the spot. Do I tremble? No. Yet---with this hand, I slew him---and the spot where his blood rattled out, is yet hot to the bottoms of my feet. It was just such a night as this. Yes---guard the door. I am your prisoner, am I?---fool! were you twenty times the man that you are—I could rend you, limb from limb, ere you were able to utter a loud cry. Beware how you provoke me. Hear me out---or, where I stand---on this very spot, will I tread your heart into the solid wood, as I did his. Hear me. It is the retribution of heaven. I am constrained to speak. It is against my will. It was just such a night as this. I had been unhappy---mad, it may be;--- for after the deed, I was mad. In that way, do I account for the tremendous fact, that I have held communion with the murdered man, night after night; slept within smell of the blood, that I had let out---travelled, through and through, the apartments of his habitation; and never knew; never suspected; never dreamt that I was within them---or near them, till this moment.” Helen heard our voices, and entered with a light.— Never did I see such a countenance as his, when that light struck it. It was dislocated marble—rigid--white— and the sweat was on it, like the night dew. “Woman—Begone!” said he. She hesitated---looked terribly alarmed---“I command thee, Helen—leave me!---dear Helen, do not trouble me, now.---But leave the light. I will be with thee, anon--- Go, Helen!—go dear.” She departed. Molton resumed his incoherent speech; and, during the whole scene that followed, he never stirred his feet, nor his hands; but, on he went, on, on forever, like a speaking corpse. “Why did I not know the spot?---it was winter then, the trees were leafless---the habitation desolate---the earth wet, and soaking to my tread.” “Your cousin insulted me. I smiled. He cursed me in the bitterness of his wrath, and hatred. I bore it all.--- Many eyes were upon me, but I bore it; for, I had learnt what it is to have the blood-dew abide upon the blossoming heart. I was patient---very patient; but, human patience hath its limits. He would have struck me. His arm was raised---it was about to descend. I retreated--- for I knew that, if it touched me, in the descent, I should shatter it to the shoulder. Nay---I knew that, ere he could raise his hand again, my knife---I always carry one---see here---this knife, would be buried, up to the handle in his side---I promised to meet him. “Alone,” said he, menacing me.---“Alone,” said I. “Your weapon?” said he. “I care not,” was my reply. But on second thought, I named the small-sword. He assented. My reasons were simple. I was a pretty good swordsman. I might disarm, or wound him. I could do as I pleased, about killing him. At any rate, swords were less fatal than pistols; for both could not well be killed with swords; and I was the challenged person. We met, at the time, and on the spot agreed upon. You have stood upon it. His body is buried under the very tree, beneath which we first measured blades. I provided against any accident; for I knew that he was desperate; and, as I had never seen him play, I thought it probable that he would shorten his blade, and close upon me.--- That might be fatal---and, therefore, I had prepared an exculpation of him, and left it upon my table, with the original correspondence between us. He, I soon found, E e 2 had done the same. We met in silence.---I never shall forget his look. It was a pale moonlight, much like this which led us abroad to-night. His eyes were of a preternatural brightness, but his lips were deadly pale.--- His bearing had been noble---but very arrogant toward me; and I gathered from his whole aspect now, that he was determined to kill me, at all hazard. I determined to prevent it. We fought. I disarmed him, once--- and broke his sword; but the point wounded me in the sword arm. I asked him if he was satisfied. He answered sullenly, no.---He grappled me by the throat, as he said this—but I broke loose from him, and dashed him against the tree. In the struggle, my sword was broken, or I should assuredly have slain him. We stood awhile, then, panting and breathing. I was exhausted, by loss of blood.—The trampling of horses' hoofs, sounded near us; and we were fain to delay our combat for awhile. I would not have believed that such a mortal deadlessness could exist in one so young. But so it was.—“Follow me,” said he.—“We shall find arms.” I followed him, weak and dizzy. He strode onward—and I never looked to the right nor left, until we stood in a large room, that I had never been in before. The moon shone through and through it.—He took a pair of pistols from that very closet.—His breathing was loud, and the only words that passed, were— “Where are we, sir?” “No matter—the house is uninhabited.” He offered me the pistol. I refused, again, and again. I was unwilling to kill him—and, perhaps, afraid to die. I felt less confidence. He pressed me sorely—he levelled. I refused to raise mine. He called me by every opprobrious name—coward—scoundrel—and liar. I shook, with terrour and rage. My blood retreated from my heart. A murderous thought arose—it might have died —but for him. I could have strangled it—but the madman, weary of delay, and impatient for my blood, sprang upon me, again; and, as he did, he pronounced a word— a single word;—it was only a name, but it was the name of one that I loved—O God!—more than anything— dead or alive---in heaven or earth—he pronounced that name—her name—and coupled it with dishonour. What followed, I hardly know. Our pistols rang together—we were blinded and stunned by the smoke and noise—we grappled, and fell—and here---here, where I now stand---I first came to my senses. My knife was in a dead man's heart---I was griping it, by the handle; and my fingers were cramped---he was cold, cold---and the moon had gone down---the smoke had all gone---and the whole house was silent as death. I arose---I was stiff and sore---I had but a dim recollection of what had passed---I recollected it, however, gradually; but I felt no emotion---none. There was a preternatural sternness and calmness in my movement. I took hold of his hand ---I lifted it---it was clenched---and it adhered to mine, strangely, for a moment;---but, I shook it off, and it fell, with a dead, heavy sound, upon the floor. I raised the head---it fell, with the same sound. I felt upon the floor ---how long it had been there, I knew not---but the blood had become a thick coagulated matter. I waited there, even there, in the darkness, for whole hours---sitting by the body—without one emotion of terrour. At last, I bethought myself of my safety. My plan was formed, immediately. I took the pistols, and the body---and I bore them to the tree, through the cold and horrible darkness and silence---the sweat falling from my face, like rain; and my shoes full of blood---partly my own---partly his. I laid him under the tree. Our broken swords, I laid by him. Our pistols, just as they were, I left. I then went into town, and caused a note to be left with you, sir—the contents of which, you cannot have forgotten. I know all your movements. But what could you do?--- It was evident that he had met me, armed against my life. What evidence had you against me? None. The wound, in his side, you had never seen---or, if you had, it would have deceived a wiser man than you; for I ran the blade of my sword into the same wound, after I had stabbed him with the knife, that you might be deceived. Are you willing to destroy me? Do your worst. Here am I---a murderer, ready to accompany you, wherever you may bid me. Let justice take its course. I am weary of life.” O, Frank, what was there in the voice of this man, the deep troubled voice, that so shook me? I felt as if I had been the murderer. Frank!---can you believe it? I stood before him, as if I were the criminal, he the judge. In my heart, I pitied him---wept with him---yea, wept with him. “And now,” said he, “I am about to depart. Never will I sleep, again, under this roof. Sleep!---O, I know not what sleep is. Let me sit down. I have something to communicate. You have been disturbed at night---all that have slept here, make the same complaint. This house was once in your family. Will you accept of it, again? You are welcome to it. I have spent a night in it, for the last time. Give me your hand. My pulse, you see, is regular and full. Now listen to me. I am no believer in spirits. I have taught myself to laugh at all tales that relate to them, as the gossip of the nursery. Yet---I cannot stay here. Let me tell you what I have seen. I had been here but two nights, when Helen awoke me, and whispered that there was somebody in the room. I arose, and searched every corner and hiding place, with my sword. She is not a timid woman;---but, hardly had I shut my eyes, when I heard her breathing change. I looked up. Omar, I am not a man to be easily disturbed. I do not depend upon my senses---they are fallible--- but I employ my reason. Yet I saw something, as plainly as I now see you, standing with its arms folded, near that window---the attitude, I then thought, was that of a wounded man. I continued to look at it, for some time; but, as I arose, it went away. I returned to my bed. I endeavoured to account for it, as an illusion. I shut my eyes;---but it was not in my brain. Nor did I again see it, although I tried every position, and watched all night. My attention was then turned to Helen. She was insensible, and white. I questioned her, when she recovered; but all that she recollected, was, that after I had returned to bed, she felt strangely cold on one side, and, happening to look up, saw, or thought she saw, the face of a dead man, close to mine. Some time after that, we were alarmed again; but, I ridiculed the whole, as a childish notion. We slept here, then; and it was only by her continual persuasion, that I removed to the chamber opposite. The servants complained of strange sounds—as of people, walking about, softly, in their stocking feet...and whispering....poor souls —and you, I remember, were cruelly disturbed. All these things made their impression upon me: but, still, I forbore to confess my terrour. I was ashamed of it—I am still ashamed of it. But, one night—listen to me, patiently. It may never be your fate, to meet with a man who can tell, so calmly, what he has seen; or one, who appears so entirely master of himself, and is honest and true.” I was walking, excessively fatigued, about two months ago, along a desolate road, in this neighbourhood. There was a thick mist in the wind. You have observed the strange, foreign air, of this old town. The venerable solidity, fashion and spaciousness, of the dwelling-houses —all standing apart and alone—surrounded by heavy, well built walls—with towers, wings, arches, and abutments—are of another age—another country—another race of men. What a profound silence, at this moment, over the whole place! It is a perfect solitude; and every dwelling house, of itself, is another solitude, totally unlike any thing else to be found in America. You are not so sensibly affected with the silent, old fashioned feudal grandeur of the habitations here, as I am. But, had you never entered one of them, till you were a full grown man, you would feel as I do. Just turn your head for a moment—look through that narrow window—where will you find such a tree as that?—it looks as if it were a thousand years old. That clear, deep water, too!—I remember that very glitter, on the night of which I speak —it was like a brightness in the air. Look there, too. Indeed, sir, you must feel it—every man must feel, standing as we are now, alone, at night, in a vast chamber like this, looking out upon the whole city of Annapolis, that here dwelt the ancient nobility of Maryland---haughty and lonely. It looks dark and sullen, as the retreat of decayed gentility—almost baronial gentility—should look. Mr. Omar, I was never more affected with the solemnity of the place, than on that night. I wandered, I know not how long, nor hardly in what direction, with my eyes upon the ground, continually asking myself what had become of the ancient people—whose dwelling places, about me, were no longer inhabited; or inhabited by strangers to their blood, who had bought manors and castles, literally, for a few hundreds of dollars. At last, I found myself in the open fields, there—back of you— near the Severn—just in the centre of that beautiful sweep, there, where all the waters run together, and shut up the town;—but still, I held on my way, for the cool, fresh feeling of the wet turf, was pleasant to my feet—now and then, looking about me for glimpses of the water, and half inclined to go into it, and spend the night there, in swimming about the full brink. I do not well know how it happened, but, at last, I had fairly lost myself. There was a thick mist in the air—a something heavier than mist—a fog, that loaded down the heart. I felt it, like a heavy weight, upon my blood.— I grew troubled, without knowing why;—and, after a while—I know not how long I had been rambling with my head down—happening to look up, toward the higher ground—near the water—I saw, what I thought, a man following me. It was late, and I was unarmed--- or, rather, I had no arms but this knife, which my residence in South America, gave me the custom of wearing. But he kept opposite to me; and walked, I thought, like one in distress. I approached him. He vanished. I then thought that it was my own shadow, and produced by some optical delusion; for such things have been. I returned to the very spot—I saw it again—I walked, but the shadow stopped—I stood still, yet that walked. It was not my shadow;—because there was no light—no moon—no star—it was only a sickly twilight. My heart did feel cold at last, and my blood curdled. I approached; it stood still, like one, sternly regarding me. Nay, I could have sworn that I struck my knife into it, once more—for I was desperate, with a strange unnatural ferocity—when lo! I saw it walking before me again, at a great distance, with long strides, and a noise. less step. Even then, shall I confess it to you?—I thought of William—the manner appeared like his—and my blood ran cold. Such was the effect, that I became sick. I have now done. I am satisfied. I do not say that he hath appeared to me. No—I choose to imagine that, what I have seen, is a deception. But, I will not expose myself any longer, to such deception. It would drive me mad. Farewell.—Do with me, what you will. The house is yours—furniture and all. I shall leave it, this hour, never to enter it again. I shall only send for my books, and a few pictures, that are dear to me—.” There, Frank—what am I to do with him?—I will be governed by you. Write to me, immediately. As for the house, I will have nothing to do with it. It is of no great value, to be sure; and the furniture is mere rubbish; but, although it is quite too serious a matter to accept in this way---I am unaccountably affected. A strange humour is upon me. What think you? I have tried to forget it all; but something was there, I am sure of it--- it was not the mere delirium of a fever! Tell me—do you believe it possible for the departed to re-appear?— How little this Molton is known? He makes no stir, here, now; and the affair of poor William's death seems to be forgotten.—What shall we do? JOHN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MAD. VERNON TO JULIET. “God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,” my child. Come to my arms. I have succeeded, at last, blessed be heaven;—I have succeeded! and all that I have, dear, is thine. The decision was finally made, about a month since—but I feared to declare it, we have had so many disappointments, until the money was actually in my hands. It is so now, at this moment; and the power that I have to make my sweet, dear Juliet, happy and independent, is a compensation for all. Use no ceremony— no delay—the gentleman that bears this, will take you immediately under his protection; and never leave your side, till my old arms are about you. And then—O Juliet!—my child!—my child!—how happy we shall be!— Your tenderness, and patience, and piety, are now to be rewarded. No—it is no longer necessary to expose thy young heart, to aught that may covet it. Together, we will live—together die, now, dear, unless some great heart shall learn thy value—and thine shall beat for it. Come to me. I shall not sleep, till we meet. CLAIRE VERNON.</field>
