      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 2 STREETS OF LONDON. In few places are the “lights and shadows” of life more strongly and vividly contrasted than in the streets of a great metropolis; where bloated wealth and hollow-eyed poverty trudge side by side, and gay, fluttering vanity and squalid wretchedness gaze strangely at each other. It is dramatic, but unpleasant; at least until custom has produced the callousness of heart requisite to enable a man to look philosophically on all human sorrow, save his own peculiar portion. Before he has arrived at this state, however, a stroll through the streets of a crowded city is apt to be uncommonly beneficial. It generates a series of practical sermons, for which every poor distressed object furnishes an eloquent text, tending to inculcate gratitude for his own station, charity for the miseries, and toleration for the frailties of others. A back street in London shows a man a few of the realities of life. To use a pugilistic phrase, “it takes the conceit out of him.” I am sometimes sorrier for my own disappointments than for any person's; and occasionally pity and indulge in the tenderest and most delicate sympathy imaginable towards myself, on account of any trivial inconvenience or privation to which I may happen to be subjected; but I have never entered a London by-lane in this frame of mind without walking out “a wiser and a sadder man” at the other end.” There is a vast deal of difference between fanciful or poetical unhappiness and harsh prose misery—plain, unvarnished, substantial misery, arising from tangible wants and physical sufferings. It is too much the fashion of the world to exaggerate and swell into undue importance half real and half imaginary mental woes, and to sneer at and undervalue common bodily evils. Your young poets and lady poetesses (heaven bless them!) and indeed all persons of genteel sensibilities, are continually plunging into the extreme depths of desolation on what would appear to a common-sense man rather insufficient grounds. But going arithmetically to work, it will be a tolerably-sized grief which produces as much pain as a prolonged, stinging tooth-ache; and six-and-thirty hours, or upwards, without victuals, must be almost as bad to bear as slighted love, notwithstanding the assertions of sensitive young ladies (who have chicken at command) to the contrary. Indeed, it has always struck me that going without a dinner must be provocative of a vast deal of pathos; and that it is rather unfair to make such an outcry about “woes that rend the breast,” while the pangs and twinges of the contiguous parts of the body, on a descending scale, are never taken into consideration by those who have never felt them. If this view of things be correct—and it is correct—how much intense suffering does the blessed sun look down upon every day! Ah! who that has seen the gaunt, shrivelled frame—the sharpened features—the bloodless, compressed lips, and sunken greedy eye which famine produces, but has felt sick at heart, and inwardly prayed to be preserved, above all things, from inanition. The omission of even such commonplace things as victuals, will, in an astonishingly short time, convince the most wretchedly romantic youth that ever fell in love, folded his arms, and turned his face moonwards, of the excellent properties, moral and physical, of a beef-steak. The afflictions which poverty brings with it in the country are as nothing to the infinity of evils in which it enmeshes those who are cooped up in cities. In the country, though the beds of the poor be hard, and their food coarse, and their raiment ragged, they have at least the free fresh air of heaven to blow upon them, and they enjoy the changes and delights which the ever-varying seasons bring around, in common with the wealthiest. The odor of the flower is as grateful to their sense—the warble of the bird as pleasant to their ear—and the velvet turf as soft and elastic to their tread as to that of the man of many acres. With only the cost of a little care, liberal nature clusters the briery rose about their lowly windows, and twines the graceful woodbine around their humble doors; and not unfrequently in the prime of summer, the mean clay walls of their cottages are completely buried from the view beneath a mass of vegetative beauty and fragrance. The village school gives their children at least glimmerings of knowledge, and the bell of each returning sabbath calls them (seldom in vain) to their simple village church. They have many, very many hardships and difficulties to wrestle with, but they have at least a chance afforded them of being hardy, healthy men and women; and, in the calm of evening (despite of partial and exaggerated statements to the contrary) there are still hundreds of poor peasants that can stand at their cottage doors and feel that content and happiness are not merely empty sounds. But, alas! for 2* the “city's pale abortions;”—alas! for the child born amid sin and gin in a confined, filthy London court or alley, down which not even a straggling breath of pure air, by any accident, ever found its way. What a place for infancy—for the gleesome sports of childhood! But such have no infancy— they never are children (except in stature). The springs of life are poisoned in the outset, and the mind, as it gradually unfolds, is as gradually soiled and tainted by all the urchin sees, and hears, and learns. It never has the undoubting confidence and frankness of a child, but becomes at once a premature adult in head and heart; and is almost as knowing, lynx-eyed, artful and suspicious as the fully-developed sinners by whom it is surrounded. Where is the wonder if a few more years fulfil its destiny, and bring it to the convict ship or the gallows? The greatest miracle is, that the lowest of the low in London—surrounded as they hourly are by debasing influences—retain so many human sympathies and kindly feelings as they do, and as they frequently evince towards each other.[1] [1] “None are all evil,” says Byron. A poor street-walker, remarkable for the kindness and gentleness of her disposition, and who was generally known amongst her class by the appellation of “handsome Polly,” lately, in a fit of despair, finished her career by throwing herself into one of the canals. Her body was handed over to the civil authorities. The frail sisterhood of her district clubbed their mites together, and raised a sum sufficient to bury her, as the saying is, “decently;” but on waiting on the magistrate for the body, they were informed that it had to be handed over for dissection as a warning to others how they committed suicide! and they were thus prevented from carrying into execution perchance the only good action they had attempted for years. “He whom the sword of state doth hear, Should be as holy as severe.” It is to be hoped the worthy magistrate is so; but I very much question both the moral and legal justice of his decision. Poor wretches! Virtue should have lenity on one hand and toleration on the other, when she overlooks their accounts, and take especial note of the few blossoms of good that spring up in such a wilderness of evil. She ought to act upon the principle I heard laid down by a bloated hackney coachman, as I passed him one cold frosty morning. “Now I likes a man as can make allowances,” said he, to an ascetic-looking gentleman, who had hired his vehicle, and was apparently endeavoring to dissuade him from swallowing a glass of gin which he had purchased to settle his nerves, preparatory to starting. “It may all be true what you says, sir, but it's uncommon hard on a poor fellow like me.—Now I likes a man as can make allowances!” and without further interlocution he raised the cordial with trembling eagerness to his lips. By the position of the glass he might have half emptied it, when a miserable half-clad female, shivering with cold, crawled by, and as she passed looked wistfully in his face. The look was understood. It touched a sympathetic chord in the gindrinker's heart, and he made a full pause—“I say ma'am, you're welcome to a drop this cold morning; it will do you good;”—and with something of natural politeness he handed her the glass. The poor creature curtsied, sighed, thanked him, drank it, and went on. There was delirium—there might be poison in the draught, but it was given with the kindliest feelings, and the offering, whether for good or evil, was at least accompanied by the merit of a self-sacrifice of no trifling magnitude. The man was evidently a drunkard—he might be a blackguard—and, I dare say, was altogether unfitted for universal suffrage; but still he had “an eye for pity,” and when, poor fellow! he has succeeded in drinking himself into some obscure grave, I trust he will then experience the benefit of his maxim of “making allowances.” Often when tired of walking the noble thorough-fares of London, surrounded by wealth and affluence in every direction, I have turned from them, and taking some lofty church, or other prominent landmark, for a guide, rambled carelessly towards it. I will never forget the melancholy streets I have repeatedly passed through in these heedless peregrinations. Some solely set apart for the most abandoned, inconceivable profligacy; others of good reputation, but in which starving economy was evidently engaged in an unceasing warfare with utter want and destitution. This is the sort of streets where the bankrupt tradesman, the unemployed lawyer or physician, the rejected author, and the slighted artist herd together. Alas! how many “good men and true” have perished in these dreary precincts, unnoticed and unknown? How many of “nature's gentlemen,” with their fine, high spirits and inborn love of pleasure, but lacking the means of honorably gratifying their social propensities, have sunk, step by step, into the mire of degradation and debasement, until they became the companions of sharpers, or the oracles of pot-houses? How many a gifted spirit, whose strong integrity poverty could not shake, has worn himself away, “contending with low wants and lofty will”—has sickened, perchance of the struggle, yet still borne on for the sake of others, until some slight addition has been forced upon the already intolerable burden, and heart and hope have at once given way, and he has dropped “unhonour'd and unsung,” into the common place of repose “where bailiffs cease from troubling, and debtors are at rest.”— Such like blue-devilish reflections have ofttimes forced themselves upon me while roaming amid these dreary dwellings; and I have always felt relieved when on unexpectedly emerging from their dim confines, I have found myself in the vicinity of the open parks, or other fashionable promenades, where vinegar-visaged adversity dared not show her face, and all was life, animation, and enjoyment, and the brilliant butterflies of fashion (with some admixture of loggerheads) were disporting in the sunshine, pranked out in the newest vanities. It was, to say the least, a pleasant dramatic contrast, with a material improvement in the dresses and decorations. Among their other attractions, the streets of London are rife with human curiosities; and an ardent zoologist must find it very pleasant employment going about comparing the various specimens of the species, assembled from all parts of the globe. The slim, swarthy-featured Lascar or Malay animals (imported in the East India Company's ships), with their malicious countenances and small rattlesnake eyes, in vivid relief to the hippopotamus-looking Bavarian or Dutch “broom girls;” with faces strikingly similar in form and expression to those of the well-fed cherubs to be met with on gravestones or above altar-pieces; then there are the juvenile countrymen of William Tell, who have come all the way from the borders of “Geneva's blue waters,” or alpine heights where the eagle builds in safety, to the streets of London, to grind away, with cruel perseverance, on a disorganized barrel organ; or vainly endeavor, with unrelenting assiduity, to extract music from the still more distressing hurdy-gurdy. Wandering Savoyards too, with their monkeys, and Scotch bagpipers with their appropriate instruments of torture. Of all the heterogeneous mass, however, the most pitiable are the poor image boys—the offspring of old Rome!— with their lank, sallow cheeks, and large lustrous eyes, pleading, as they best may, in our harsh northern tongue, for the custom of the descendants of the barbarian subjects of their forefathers! I have often been struck with the helpless, desolate look of these poor fragile Italians, wanderers from their own delicious land to a country where they stand all day shivering in the very sunshine, and then creep at night into holes where it were a pity for a dog to lie down and die. But of all the mendicant classes, which go vagabondizing about, setting equally at defiance old, impotent acts of parliament and the vigilant new police, by far the sturdiest and most numerous are those natives of the metropolis who have devoted their time and talents to the study of music for the public benefit. They have, as may be surmised, no regular engagements or fixed salaries, but roam about impregnating the air with strange noises in every direction. Unlike the Provençal troubadours of old, they are not distinguishable by any particular costume, but rather affect a diversified style of dress. Their capabilities are wonderful. They do not, like Braham, Phillips, Sinclair, or other professionals, confine themselves to any particular style, but range at will through all the subtle varieties of musical composition, from Mozart to Alexander Lee inclusive. If they fall short of vocalists of greater pretensions in some particulars, they have the advantage of them in others. They are never taken suddenly ill—no man sins his soul by making apologies for them, and they sing equally with a hoarseness as without it. In one thing they strikingly resemble their brethren of the stage, namely, in the infallible tact and nicety of judgment displayed in introducing airs in appropriate situations; and it is pleasant, amid the rattling of carriages, the rumbling of carts, the heavy rolling of wagons, and the multifarious cries of oysters, hot rolls, and old clothes, to hear a fellow bawling— “Oft in the stilly night, Ere slumber's chain has bound me, Fond memory brings the light Of other days around me!” or a waddling old woman, with a strictly feline organ, squalling in the vicinity of Billingsgate, “Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear, Or like a fairy trip upon the green!” At first this class might be confounded with an inferior species in the provinces, commonly called ballad-singers; but their habits are essentially different. The primitive race that used to chronicle the deeds of “Jack Monroe,” or narrate how “All in the good ship Rover,” they had “sailed the world around,” are now nearly extinct in the me tropolis. The present “minstrelsy” of London, seem to execute no other than the newest and most fashionable pieces; and the contrast is, at times; both laughable and melancholy, in returning from the theatre where Vestris, or some of the other sirens of the stage, have been floating before you in an atmosphere of pleasure, and warbling their arch or joyous ditties to delighted ears, to hear some poor homeless wretch, trembling in the heavy dews of midnight, howling the self-same strains to heedless passengers as they hurry past him with a quickened step to their comfortable beds. You scarcely know which to be sorriest for—the air or the performer. The contrast too, between the words of the lively, pathetic or bacchanalian melodies which VOL. II. 3 they have ever in their mouths, and their own mean and miserable appearance, is continually giving rise to the most ludicrous associations. It rather makes a man smile to hear a poor hatless, coatless, shoeless wanderer, lugubriously laboring away at “Oh there's nothing in life can sadden us,” bleating out “The young May-moon is beaming, love,” or dolefully asseverating “My heart my heart is breaking, For the love of Alice Gray.” “Heaven tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.” It must be so; or how these people, exposed to nearly every ill that flesh is heir to, (unless indeed they have become inured to starvation, or else have got into a mechanical habit of living on from day to day, and do not like to give it over,) continue to keep up their hearts and still face existence, is more than I can possibly conjecture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHRISTMAS. Heap on more wood!—the wind blows chill; But let it whistle as it will, We'll keep our christmas merry still. —Scott. “A merry christmas and a happy new-year!”— How many million times will this good-natured salutation be interchanged, wherever the English language is spoken, before the present and following weeks pass over. It is, to be sure, a mere matter of course, a compliment of the season: but yet, methinks there is more right-good will in the delivery of it than in the generality of compliments: the hearty and jovial animation of the countenance, the frank and cheerful tone of the voice, and the rough and friendly pressure of the hand, go along with the words as a commentary, the obvious import of which is, contrary to the ordinary practice of society, “I mean what I say.” There is less selfishness at christmas than at any other time. Men appear to pay more attention to that much-neglected scriptural injunction, “love thy neighbor as thyself,” and the cares and schemes of those who struggle for existence in great cities, are suffered to lie dormant for a brief space. The stomach is more thought of than the purse; and when a man thinks seriously of his stomach, with a fair prospect of having his visions realized, his natural disposition dies within him, and he becomes a generous, meek, and equitable animal. Whatever is thought of the poetry there may be reasonable doubts entertained of the policy of Lear's advice, “Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them, And show the heavens more just;” for it is exactly at the time when a man feels most uncomfortable himself, that he thinks least of the discomforts of others; and many a one, who, before breakfast on a cold morning, with no prospect of the fire burning, would not give sixpence to save half the human race from starvation, will, after a satisfactory dinner, talk with unction of the miseries of the poor, and subscribe his dollar without thinking himself guilty of an extravagance. When he is cold and comfortless himself, he is a piece of concentrated selfishness—his sympathies are as frozen as his fingers, and he has no superflux benevolence; but as his stomach becomes literally closed his heart is figuratively opened, and he parts with his money with fewer pangs than naturally accompany that disagreeable operation. There is one essential difference between the christmas of the present times and those of a few years ago, namely the weather. The fine, clear, cold weather formerly characteristic of this season, is now so no longer; and in its place have come mild, sickly, drizzly days, that properly belong to no particular season. It is a pity that fog and civilization should go hand in hand, and that the clearing away of the immense forests of the west should be one main cause why this pestiferous weather is substituted for the healthy, hardy frosts of former times. It is a great drawback; for with what face can any one wish his friend joy, when he can scarcely discern his lineaments through the fog; or ask him to be merry, when saturated through and through with villanous vapor? And then the women! What a pleasant sight it was, on a clear, frosty christmas morning, with the snow crackling beneath your feet, and the sleigh-bells tinkling merrily in your ears, to see some comfortably-clad and comfortable-looking damsel tripping cheerfully yet carefully over the slippery side-walk, with cheeks into which the cold and exercise had sent a glow more deep and rich than the most brilliant carnation!—with eyes sparkling and dancing in liquid splendor, and her 3* warm breath playing back upon her face, seeking, as it were, shelter from the sharp air amid her clustering curls—smiling and laughing, she knew not why, and cared not wherefore. Now, the scene is changed—they “walk in silk attire,” with artificial flowers on their heads, and soleless shoes on their feet; picking their steps among the multitudinous small pools which the street-inspector leaves for the accommodation of pedestrians, with faces of a neutral tint, alike different from the ruddy glow of winter and the sunny bloom of summer. But even this change, like every other, bad as it is upon the whole, is not without its advantages: “There is a soul of goodness in things evil, Would men observingly distil it out,” and those who are admirers of, and connoisseurs in delicately turned ankles, have now a better opportunity for more particular and impartial observation. Poultry is the only thing which does not seem to share in the general joy on the approach of this happy period; and all who have entered deeply into the study of the science of ornithology in general, and domestic fowlology in particular, must have observed in the eyes of turkeys more especially, a sort of melancholy presentiment, as if “coming events” had actually “cast their shadows before,” and chickens look as if they already beheld the delicate pies, of which they are to form a part. The goose, that most incorrigible bird, it is true, is a goose to the last, turning up a lack-lustre eye at the hand preparing to twist its neck about, and it never occurs to it to flap its wings or offer any resistance until the head is detatched from the body, which, according to the immutable laws of nature, is a little too late. These speculations may seem fanciful, but many ingenious theories have been constructed on as slim a foundation. How many good things have been said and sung of christmas, from the old poets in Elizabeth's time down to Washington Irving. Indeed, for mirth and music—friendship and flummery—love and liquor poetry and poultry—gaiety and gormandizing— dancing and dinner-parties, there is no time like christmas. A spirit of enjoyment—an universal freedom from restraint prevails; the most prudent relax, the most frigid melt; even that anomalous class of bipeds denominated “serious young men,” are guilty of merriment, and sip their wine and lisp their jokes with impunity. A jovial farewell is taken of the parting year, and a jovial welcome given to its successor. No man attends to his business, unless he be a publican or a pastry cook; and all sorts of profitable employments are looked on as nuisances. Merchant meets merchant, and the price of stocks is not inquired after—tradesman meets tradesman, and the shop is unthought of. Friend dines with friend, old intimacies are renewed, differences forgotten, and a spirit of good-will and kindly feeling, well befitting the season, “reigns in all bosoms.” “Merry christmas!” even now thy influence, like a charm, is over all. Now are parties projected in the parlor, while through the kitchen rings the din of merciless preparation—now do black cooks rise ten per cent. in the scale of creation, and those who can withstand a hot fire are not to be treated with coolness—now do serenaders take their stand in the damp streets, and, like frogs in a fog, their voices are heard through the thick atmosphere, croaking of love and music, in imitation of Spain and Italy, while the noise of neighboring taverns mingles with their melody; and now do young ladies throw open the windows to testify their grateful acceptance of the homage of those weather-contemning swains, and many catch quinsies by this sacrifice of prudence to passion—now do superlatively witty jokes pass between young ladies and gentlemen concerning their prospects of matrimony before another christmas—now do men eat more than is deemed necessary for the support of nature; apoplexies are prevalent, and the heirs of fat old men look forward with pleasing anticipations—now is the air of bar rooms laden with monotonous yet pleasing interrogations of “What will you take to drink?” and no answers are heard in the negative—now, as the glass circulates quickly round, friendships become stronger as brains become weaker, and more promises are made than will be kept—now are several men seen reposing in the streets, with the pavement for a bed and the curb-stone for a pillow. Peacefully do they slumber! having that within them which makes their flinty couch “soft as the thrice-driven down”—and now do the —of —editors sharpen their pens, and prepare to narrate manifold instances of the “fatal effects of intemperance,” in their very best style—now do inveterate moralists indite long essays, stating that there have been many changes in the year that is past, and likewise the probability that there will be many more in the year that is to come—now do the respectable members of the “calliothumpian band” prepare to disturb the peace and quiet of the republic, and the New-York Dogberries hold consultation concerning the powers vested in them by the constitution; and now, also, is the constabulatory force of the city held in less respect by the juvenile citizens than is due to constituted authorities—now do young aspirants to “Tom and Jerry” fame get well kicked, bruised, beaten, and carried to the watch-house, all which they term “sport,” and sober, sensible people begin to entertain doubts concerning the meaning of the word—now do many more things take place than are “dreamt of in philosophy,”— and now do I put a period to the apprehensions of the reader by prudently coming to a conclusion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE DRAMA AS IT IS. The drama is a poetry which, in its legitimate scope, must be addressed to all ranks of society—must wear the common garb and speak the common language of all. It is the forum where all ranks meet and are but equal; where the base of mankind unlearn their ferocity and divest themselves of their callousness; and where, likewise, the noble and gentle must dispense with artificial feelings, and know, whatever be the shell, the kernel is at best but a man. —Anon. There are few subjects, if any, that have elicited a greater flow of words, than what is termed the “decline of the legitimate drama.” It is one of the most approved and enduring themes extant for small declamation, and has consequently become the almost exclusive property of “smart young men” and unfledged scribblers, who think it looks well to lament the non-enactment of Shakspeare, and to indulge in little frothy vituperations against the bad taste of the public, and the intellectual depravity of the managers, actors, and modern authors. They discuss in the most flippant aad self-satisfied manner a question involving the most vexing and perplexing difficulties, and pass their silly censures and give their witless advice upon a subject of which they are profoundly ignorant. When a satirist, like Lord Byron or Mr. Charles Sprague, or any man of talent, undertakes to lash the vices of the stage, the lack of practical knowledge is overlooked in the display of poetic power; they present us with a forcible picture of what is bad, but without pointing out the efficient means of making that bad better; they dwell much upon the faults and follies of the system, because faults and follies are the food of the satirist; and they will even, at times, give very fine advice, which has only the fault of not being practcable. They ought to bear in mind what Portia truly and sensibly says, “If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.” Lord Byron, when he dipped his pen in gall, and wrote his “English bards and Scotch reviewers,” denounced the stage among other existing follies; but when he actually became concerned in the management of Drury-lane, he found it a great deal easier to censure than amend. And yet now the A. and B. newspaper critics prate about the offence given to their delicate tastes, when a profitable piece of nonsense happens to be enacted, instead of Shakspeare or the “sterling English comedies!” But the best of the joke is, that most of this kind of persons, whom we have had the misfortune to become acquainted with, in reality know no more of the sterling English comedies (except a few of the most popular) than they do of Homer in the original; and as for Shakspeare, their knowledge of him is confined to his Macbeth, Othello, Richard the Third, and a few more of his acting plays; while his more imaginative ones, his Tempest and Midsummer Night's Dream, are so much heathen Greek to them; may, one whom we knew, that pretended a most overweening admiration for the immortal bard, actually did not know that he had written either songs or sonnets; and upon being told that the popular song of “Bid me discourse,” was one of his, resented the information as an impudent attempt to undervalue his understanding and impose upon his credulity! Yet this is, for the most part, the sort of people that affect a stately supremacy, and talk about managers “dazzling the eyes of the ignorant vulgar,” and “catering for the vitiated taste of the public.” Now we are by no means going so far as to contend that the “drama as it is,” is any thing like the “drama as it ought to be:” but we do mean to say, that there is an “infinite deal of nothing,” or, at least, nothing but unmingled cant, preached VOL. II. 4 upon this very subject. Even at the present day, Shakspeare is played ten times to any other author's once, and would, if the public attended, be enacted still more frequently; and for this simple and satisfactory reason, that his drama has not one half the expense of modern pieces, for they have the beauty that “Needs not the foreign aid of ornament;” consequently, the cost of “scenery, machinery, dresses, and decorations,” is all saved; and to those who, for want of a genuine admiration of that truly immortal man, counterfeit an ardent longing for his more frequent presentation on the stage, we would say—or rather we will tell them an anecdote which, though old, is good and applicable, and may be more to the purpose than argument. A certain king of France had a very pretty queen whom he loved “passing well,” at least, considering that he was a Frenchman and she was his wife, but still not with such exclusive devotion as to prevent “His spirit hunting after new fancies.” A worthy ecclesiastic about the court perceiving this, undertook to lecture his majesty upon the subject, and expressed his surprise that he could slight so beauteous a lady for others evidently her inferior. The king, instead of answering the question, asked the priest what dish he was most partial to. “Partridges,” answered the friar, in an emphatic tone, while his eyes glistened and his lips moved involuntarily at the ideas which the mention of has favorite repast called forth—“partridges, your majesty.” The next morning the worthy clergyman was lodged in prison, and for fourteen days, morning, noon and night—breakfast, dinner, and supper —partridges and partridges only were set before him, until the gastric juices of the worthy ecclesiastic could no longer endure this horrible monotony, and he exclaimed, in an agony of feeling, that “they might imprison him as long as they liked, if they would only give him something else to eat!” Upon this the king sent for him. “How is this,” said his majesty, “that you complain of your favorite fare?” “Partridges are excellent,” quoth the friar, “but always partridges!” “The queen is excellent,” retorted his majesty, “but always the queen!” and so the king had his joke, and the priest a change of diet. Now we hope that no person whose imagination particularly qualifies him for finding out a bad moral, will infer from this, that we mean to applaud his majesty's very improper and naughty behaviour; all that is meant to be deduced from the story is, that Shakspeare, always Shakspeare, would be neither profitable to the managers, nor pleasing to the public. The mind of man requires a variety of intellectual food, just as the stomach requires a variety of animal nutriment; and that mind is perhaps the healthiest, and that stomach the strongest, which can enjoy themselves off whatever is set before them: what they lose in extreme delicacy, they make up in vigour. With some people, as the saying is, “all is fish that comes to their net;” if they can get a good tragedy or comedy, so much the better; if not, an opera will do as well; if that is not to be had, why then a broad farce, or a broader melo-drama; or in default of these, even an extravaganza or a pantomime; always provided, that the thing be tolerably good of its kind; and the man who on one night laughs heartily at the extravagance of Hilson, or the extravagant extravagance of Barnes, in some of their “broad-grin” parts, is more likely on the next to relish the passion and pathos, the exquisite poetry and divine philosophy of Shakspeare, than one of those squeamish and pedantic personages, whose “Visages do cream and mantle like a standing pool,” who dare not be caught enjoying themselves with any thing save what is of acknowledged excellence, and who turn up their good-for-nothing noses at the efforts of every author or actor who has not as yet received the stamp of public approbation. It is really amusing at times to sit in a theatre and witness the behaviour of one of these gentry—to see the air of critical primness which he assumes on the entrance of a celebrated actor, or to observe the smile of supercilious pity which he casts upon some poor wretch beside him, who is thrown into ecstacies by a comic song, a bad joke, Barnes's wig coming off, or any other interesting incident which “Sir Oracle” esteems frivolous. And when two of them get together, the way in which they reflect each other's folly—the looks of deep significance that pass between them—and the air of conscious superiority with which they survey the ordinary mortals around them, is as instructing and amusing as the play, let it be what it may. In theatrical matters we must confess that our own taste is by no means particularly fastidious, but is capable of embracing all the different species (not individuals) of the dramatic family, even the tribe most vilified of all, known by the appellation of melo dramas; and though, certainly, this class owns many members too bad for human endurance, yet there are others capable of interesting and exciting the feelings in no common degree. Though 4* there are bad melo-dramas without number, yet a good melo-drama is not so bad a thing. It is a sort of skeleton tragedy, without the stateliness and poetry, where the murders are committed in simple prose, and the villanies carried on without the aid of blank verse. It is the sketch and outline of a tragedy where actions are represented rather than characters delineated, and where every thing is broad and general, coarse and rough, but which when well enacted and kept within the moderate bounds of probability, sometimes excite the feelings to a pitch that prevents sleep during the more interesting scenes. Nay, so very unrefined is our taste, that we cannot join in the prevailing hue and cry against gaudy spectacles and splendid scenery, thinking them very good in their place, and even feeling an unbecoming interest in the “dresses and decorations,” particularly of the ladies, for a well-dressed woman is at any time pleasanter to look upon than a dull play. There are, however, some things occasionally exhibited which there is no getting over, to wit, dogs, horses, elephants, and the brute creation in general—real fire and real water, wonderful ascensions from the stage to the gallery, impressive ceremonies of shooting deserters—jugglers, rope-dancers and little children—these are unalloyed, unmitigated evils. But though gaud and show, and spectacles and melo-dramas are pleasant enough occasionally and in their place, it is the interest and duty of every one who values sound rational dramatic representations to raise his voice against them when they are too frequently introduced, and assume an undue importance in the evening's entertainment. They are well enough as a dessert after more solid and substantial aliment, but if furnished as the principal intellectual food for the theatre-going public, the inevitable consequence will be depravity of taste, and attenuation of intellect. Let a good tragedy or comedy; which in itself contains enough poetry and passion, wit and sense for any reasonable man for one evening, be first enacted, and then let any popular nonsense most in vogue occasionally follow, by which arrangement all parties will be satisfied. Though the public cannot justly be charged with indifference in respect to Shakspeare, yet it is to be regretted that they certainly do display an apathy towards the genuine old comedies, (ah! they know not the treasures which they pass unheeded by!) yet this, in a great measure, arises from their not being familiar with their merits. Managers ought to endeavour to create a taste for the more correct appreciation of the genuine excellencies of the old dramatic authors. Let them not be discouraged by a few indifferent houses, but persevere. If they were to set apart a particular night in each week for the production of a sterling comedy, this would amount to between forty and fifty pieces of real merit in the course of the season—an immense acquisition. And if the newspapers and literary journals were to make a point of especially noticing and commenting on that evening's performance, there is little doubt that in a short time it would not only be creditable and profitable to the managers, but credita-and profitable to the public.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MAN OF THE FLY-MARKET FERRY. An indefinite number of years ago I boarded in the Bowery. Our accommodations were, in those days, looked upon as something superior; it being an established rule of the house for not more than six gentlemen to sleep in one room, which to me, who was a stranger to the customs of New-York, appeared in the hot summer nights, a sufficiency. The boarders were principally young men, most of them clerks in drygood stores, and the conversation generally turned upon the quantity of sales they had severally effected in the course of the day, the particulars of which they narrated with an appearance of intense interest, bordering on enthusiasm. I was always of a speculative rather than a practical turn of mind, and I confess those counter and counting-house reminiscences did not powerfully affect me, though I listened to them in a devotedly decorous manner. One individual alone attracted my attention. He was a middle-aged man, about the middle height, and neither very corpulent nor otherwise, and at first sight there appeared nothing about him to distinguish him from the ordinary run of mortals. He was, however, a singular individual, and had some strange peculiarities. Melancholy had “marked him for her own;”—he was evidently a man of many sorrows, and a deep and settled grief seemed to pervade his every action. His appetite was uncommonly good, and he ate more and talked less than any man I ever saw. He was an inoffensive being; and yet, for some unascertained cause, the landlady “looked loweringly” upon him.—As I entered the house rather abruptly one evening, I perceived the middle-aged gentleman and the lady of the mansion in deep and earnest conversation. The tones of her voice were sharp and decided—her action was energetic in the extreme—her face had lost much of the mild expression and winning softness which characterize her sex, and I distinctly heard her pronounce the impressive words—“I have been put off long enough, and I'll be put off no longer!” The middle-aged gentleman sighed profoundly; he was evidently much affected, and without saying a word, he took up his candle, and retired to his bed. Heaven only knows what were his reflections! Next morning, notwithstanding the severe mental struggle of the preceding evening, not a trace of passion was visible on his countenance. He was calm, though by no means collected, for instead of taking his place next the landlady, as was his wont, he obliviously seated himself opposite a dish of pickled salmon, a fish for which he had always manifested a decided predilection. His mind was in a high state of abstraction—the world around was to him as nothing—and he helped himself four times from the savoury fish alluded to, without in the least noticing the inflamed and ominous looks of the hostess. He continued to eat, as it appeared to me, mechanically, long after the other boarders had arisen from the table, until looking around and perceiving that he was seated alone with the lady, who was apparently preparing to open a conversation, with more agility than I had previously seen him manifest, he started from his chair—seized by mistake a new hat instead of his old one from the pile in the passage, and rushed out of the house. He came not to dinner, and at tea he was not visible! “Next morn we miss'd him at his 'customed seat, “Along the side, nor at the foot was he: “Another came—” but not so did the middle-aged gentleman, and from that time forward he was seen among us no more. At the expiration of twenty-four hours, the landlady overcame her natural feelings of delicacy, and proceeded to break open his clothes chest, in order to elicit some compensation for sundry pecuniary obligations which she alleged he had omitted to discharge. I was present at the operation: the lock was forced—the lid was anxiously raised—but alas! an extensive vacuum presented itself. No integuments were there, excepting a few “shreds and patches” at the bottom of the chest in the shape of ancient shirts and fractions of neck and pocket handkerchiefs. This was all that the repository of the middle-aged gentleman contained, setting aside a few sheets of paper which the landlady threw away as rubbish, and which I instinctively secured. On one of them was written the following “Legend,” which illustrates in a high degree the morbid sensibility of the amiable writer. Connected as it is with local circumstances calculated to render it peculiarly interesting to the feelings of every New-Yorker, and breathing as it does a tone of the purest morality, I feel it my bounden duty to give it without alteration or addition to the public. The catastrophe is singularly impressive and strikingly applicable to the present high-pressure times. Though I cannot say that I myself recollect the events here recorded, there is strong reason to believe they are not apochryphal, and doubtless live in the memories of many worthy inhabitants of this city. The following is the MANUSCRIPT. “I am a miserable individual; my brightest hopes have been blighted and my finest feelings exceedingly lacerated. All my life an unfortunate constitutional temperament has disinclined me from following any useful or profitable employment; and as I inherited nothing from the author of my lamented existence, excepting a good constitution and somewhat of an epicurean taste, I have consequently been subjected to the mercenary importunities of mankind in every city, town, and village where I have resided for any length of time. Even when totally destitute of money, and without the most distant prospect of ever possessing any, they have ruthlessly pressed their claims upon me, until disgusted with their heartless importunities, I have frequently, without vouchsafing a parting word, quitted their domiciles, and wandered no one knew whither. In the course of my shifting, strolling life, I have, as might be expected, met with strange incidents and scarcely to be credited adventures, but among them all I know of none which more powerfully affected me than one which accurred in this VOL. II. 5 very city of New-York, early in the nineteenth century. “It was on a Sunday morning in the beginning of May, that I opened the door of a house which had become hateful to me, and sallied out into the street. Unconscious of what direction I was taking, chance conducted me into Maiden-lane, and I sauntered down until my further progress was impeded by the East River. It was one of those delicious May mornings when spring, as if mad with joy at effecting her escape from the dominion of winter, had infused an exuberance of life and animation into all creation. The waves were glancing and dancing in the sunshine across the beautiful bay of New-York, and the fresh breeze came sweeping over the waters. The denizens of the city were thronging across to Long Island to “Gulp their weekly air,” and many aspiring young men were seated aloft in their buggies, sulkies, and other vehicles with names of equal euphony, awaiting the arrival of the boat. A friend of mine, who happened to be going that way, entreated me to accompany him, and as he satisfied all pecuniary demands, I entered the gate, and took my station by the toll-gatherer, with whose appearance and manners I was very much struck in passing, particularly his slow and solemn way of receiving the money tendered him, and, notwithstanding the agitation and impatience of the passengers, his deliberate manner of returning the change. He was a man apparently about forty-five; his person was round, fat, oily, and somewhat loose and swampy; the original hue of his face was gone, and it was now a combination of many colors, in which red and purple predominated; its prominent protuberance was truly Bardolphian —large, bulbous, and succulent; on it “Brandy had done its worst! Nor gin, nor rum, nor any spirituous liquor, Could touch it further.” “The bell had rung for the last time, and the gate was slowly closing, when a long black column, which on nearer approach assumed a little the appearance of a human being, was seen making its way, with all possible expedition, down Maidenlane, in order to catch the boat, but whether it would succeed or not was a very dubious point. One thing was against it; the wind was blowing freshly up the street, and though the body, from its thin, hatchet-like appearance, was well adapted for cutting through an opposing current of air, yet the pressure upon the whole surface was evidently too much, for at every squall the long attenuated legs kept plunging in the wind, but without making any progress. It was like a boat pulled against a strong tide, which the rowers prevent from receding, but with all their exertions are unable to advance an inch. Fortunately, however, just as the small bell had rung to put on the steam, the breeze slackened, and the attenuation was enabled to reach the gates of the ferry. It proved to be an interesting and somewhat dyspeptic-looking young man, or rather the “sketch and outline of a man,” for he was evidently as yet only a design. Like an onion run to seed, his altitude was uncommon, but his circumference a mere joke; and what added to the length and diminished the breadth was, that he had encased himself in a long-waisted black coat, which it was his pleasure to button tightly around him, and bestowed his nether extremities in a pair of fashionable pantaloons, familiarly denominated “tights,” of the same sombre hue. I must take upon myself to say that this latter act was extremely injudicious, because the young man's legs were not particularly straight—they came in contact at the knees, but instead of descending perpendicularly, branched off so as to form the figure which geometricians call an isosceles triangle, and which is commonly defined by the term “knock-kneed.” His face was pale, thin, and uncomfortable looking, and he had altogether the appearance of having been dieted on vegetables and water during the winter months. He was such a being as Falstaff meant when he talked about a “forked radish;” or like what pretty Perdita had in her mind's eye when she exclaims— “Out alas! You'd be so lean, the blasts of January Would blow you through and through.” How he had contrived to weather the blasts of January, and attain the month of May, is one of those inscrutable mysteries of nature, which the more weak blinded man attempts to solve, the further he goes astray, until reason is swallowed up in conjecture, and “nothing is but what is not.” I can only vouch for the fact, that the month was May, and he was still a sentient being. “When the thin young man presented himself at the gate of the ferry (which was done in less time than it has taken me to describe him,) the contrast between him and the fiery-faced ferryman was most marked and striking. The latter looked at him as if he thought he was shortly bound for another world, and I myself was partly of the same opinion; be that as it might, he still evinced a laudable interest 5* in the pecuniary concerns of this, for notwithstanding the larboard chain of the boat had been unloosed, and they were preparing to do the same with the starboard, he presented the man of the Fly-market ferry with a five dollar bill of the Catawaba bank in Alabama, by which procedure he calculated not only to secure his passage gratis, but have the bill discounted at a cheaper rate than it would cost in the regular way of business. But alas! how short-sighted are the schemes of mortals, as will be made apparent hereafter. The man of the Fly-market ferry was seemingly prepared for all contingencies of this kind, for drawing from his side-pocket a large greasy-looking roll of bills, he slowly and deliberately proceeded to select the most suspicious and unbrokerable banks. Just as he had accomplished this to his satisfaction, and given back four dollars, and ninety-six cents, the starboard chain was unloosed, and the boat proceeded on her way. The young man first saw that the change was all right, and then rushed precipitately forward, and I verily believe would have succeeded in reaching the boat, had it not been decreed otherwise; but just as he had got half-way down the gang-way his foot slipped, and he fell prostrate: his bones rattled violently in his skin, and the hand which contained the change came in forcible contact with the ground—its powers of tension relaxed—and the valuable contents were precipitated into the water! “I have lived long—I have wandered over a great part of the habitable globe, and I have seen human misery and suffering in every variety of shape and degree, but such another picture of unqualified wretchedness as the thin young man presented when he found his cash was “buried in the briny tide,” and that he had lost the boat, I have not seen. (Owing to the absorbing interest of this melancholy affair, I myself had lost my passage, but not being in any particular hurry, this was a small consideration.) The stranger collected his limbs together and rose slowly from the ground, and in doing so a ray of sunshine glimmered through the gloom of his unparalleled situation, for he perceived a solitary sixpence, that had escaped the fate of its companions, lying glittering on the edge of the dock; he stooped to pick it up, but before his agitated hand could grasp this fraction of the metallic currency, a young, dirty, ragged, embryo-state-prison varlet, who was lounging about, pounced upon it, and transferred it to his own pocket. The young man naturally enough demanded the restitution of his property, but this sprout of original sin, in the most solemn manner, and with every appearance of truth, sturdily denied all knowledge of the transaction. “This was the unkindest cut of all,” and the young man gave way under it. Stunned by the heavy and quick-succeeding blows of fate, he staggered he knew not whither, and most unfortunately through the gates of the ferry, which instantly closed upon him. This immediately recalled him to a sense of his situation, and he attempted to return through the door-way, but such a proceeding encountered the decided opposition of the man of the ferry. The stranger was eloquent, and he poured forth a fervid torrent of words—he implored the ferryman by every tie, divine and human,—by all that links society together—by the confidence of man in man, to take his word that he had already paid his passage, and let him pass; this the man of the ferry undoubtedly remembered, but he was not legally bound to do so, and moreover, he also remembered the Catawaba bank bill, and peremptorily refused all re-admittance without a preliminary fourpence. The stranger finding words of no avail grew frantic, and attempted to force the passage vi et armis, but the man of the ferry pushed him back, at the same time unfeelingly exclaiming, “No you don't!” His cup of bitterness was now full to the brim and one drop over, but tears at length came to the relief of the sufferer, and he wept! The ferryman “beheld the dew-drops start,— They didn't touch his iron heart,” and the unfortunate finding all was of no use, dashed the tear from his eye, turned his back on the scene of his misery, and bent his way up Maiden-lane. One consolation was left him amid all his wretchedness—the wind was now in his favor, and he proceeded without difficulty. On coming to the corner of Pearl-street he turned along, and the interesting, dyspeptic, thin young man was lost to my sight, perchance for ever. “My tale draws fast to its tragical conclusion. I went over in the next boat, remained in Brooklyn that night, and returned the following morning. On arriving at the dock, I perceived that many people were congregated together, and also that another individual gathered in the fourpences. On inquiry I learnt that during the short interval of my absence, the man of the ferry—the author of so much misery, had been summoned to another world. The manner of his death was simply thus. After the boat had stopped running on the preceding evening, he wended his way, as was his wont, to a neighboring tavern, where he proceeded to “pour huge draughts of aqua-vitæ down,” in a way that would have petrified any unsophisticated man to behold. In this course he persevered for some time, and then to crown the whole, undertook, for a trifling wager, to swallow a pint of fourth-proof brandy at a draught. It was rather too much for him, but he had a thirst for distinction in that line; he attempted the feat and succeeded, though he immediately sunk upon the floor in a state of insensibility. The next morning when he awoke, he felt dry and feverish, and a pitcher of cold water happening unluckily to stand near, he proceeded to deluge his inward man with its contents. The result was such as might naturally have been expected under such circumstances. His inside being heated like a furnace, and no sooner had the cold water come in contact with it, than an immense quantity of steam was instantly generated; there being no safety-valve, the unfortunate man, like an overcharged boiler, instantly exploded, and the animated mass, which, but a few short hours before, I had left full of fire and spirits, was shattered into a thousand pieces, and scattered over the floor of the porter-house. Fortunately no lives, excepting his own, were lost by the explosion. A coroner's inquest was held on the body, and a verdict brought in that “the deceased came by his death in consequence of his ignorance of the power of steam.” The moral to be deduced from this event is obvious. Let no one who has had a predilection for ardent spirits—and there are but too many who have such predilections—drink copiously or incautiously of cold water, lest the result be similar, and they too share the fate of the MAN OF THE FLY-MARKET FERRY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EVILS OF EARLY RISING. It seems to be the laudable endeavor of a great portion of the present generation to prove their forefathers fools; this being the way in which they choose to evince their gratitude for the benefits they have derived from the labors of those who have gone before them. Accordingly, from the author of Devereux downwards, they are employed in running full tilt at what it is their pleasure to term “popular fallacies.” Now, notwithstanding we can travel ten miles an hour quicker than those who lived before us, I, for one, cannot help thinking that our ancestors knew something; and am therefore particularly cautious of impugning, or even entertaining doubts of the soundness of any good old maxim that may seem to have received the sanction of wiser heads than I ever expect mine to become, even in these ready-made-knowledge-days. But there is one thing which has been much advocated by doctors and moralists, (not, I suspect, without sinister motives on the part of the former,) namely, “early rising,” which I never could see the utility of, and which has only to be placed in a proper light to show at once its folly and impropriety. Let the merits of the case be examined. It is the custom of those who defend this baneful practice to appeal rather to the fancy than the reason, and to sketch a highly romantic and altogether ideal picture of the pleasures of early rural walks, &amp;c. They talk of green fields, purling streams, warbling birds, and healthful breezes, invariably winding up with a florid description of the glories of the rising sun. Now I myself, from dear-bought experience, happen to know something of these matters; for though, with one exception, I have not seen the sun rise for many years, yet in early life, when I “thought as a child and acted as a child,” I was seduced by empty rhodomontade, to adopt the pernicious practice of early rising, until a heavy cold, caught by roaming about the fields at an unseasonable hour in search of health and mushrooms, settled upon my lungs, and came pretty near making my early rising a prelude to an early grave.—But suppose a man up and dressed before the sun, (and here I will not dwell upon the VOL. II. 6 soft, delicious slumbers that have been broken and frighted away by his harsh and unnatural conduct,) suppose him up, dressed, out of the house and away to the fields. When he gets there, these fields are, to be sure, green enough—rankly green, but the dares not venture into one of them; or if he does, especially should the grass be luxuriant, he might just as well go a bathing with his nether garments on: he dares not pluck a wild flower from the hedge-side, for on approaching he finds that “Black snails and white, Blue snails and gray,” are pursuing their slimy peregrinations in every direction; the birds do not warble at that early hour, but on leaving their warm nests, flit uneasily from bush to bush, shaking their plumage, and twittering in a way certainly not calculated to raise his feelings to any ecstatic pitch. Even the cows, whose slumbers he has disturbed, arise slowly and sullenly from their damp couch, look grimly at the worshipper of nature, and proceed, in a discontented manner, to slake their thirst by nibbling the grass. These discomforts probably rather damp his feelings, and he proceeds forthwith to select a dry spot on the turnpike-road, where he stands, with his hands in his pocket, gaping at the sun getting up, and fancying himself very much delighted; though everybody knows, that for richness and beauty one sunset is worth a dozen sunrises. After this he makes it a point of duty to walk and lounge about for three or four hours, leaning over some farmer's gate-way watching the chickens, with their eyes half open, picking up stray worms, or the ducks gobbling houseless snails, when he goes home wet and weary, and finds the sensible part of the family enjoying themselves with toast and coffee. As all foolish persons dislike to confess their folly, he proceeds to state that he has had “such a charming walk!” thereby not only sinning his miserable soul before breakfast, and giving the father of lies a decided advantage for the rest of the day, but inducing other unsuspicious victims to follow his scandalous example. There is more truth than poetry in this plain statement of the case, which will be found correct nine times out of ten, even in the most favorable season of the year—summer; what then must an early morning's walk be through the chills and drizzle of spring or the substantial fogs of autumn? As for winter, the idea of a man leaving his warm bed, and wading through ice and snow without the prospect of any thing but a frost-bitten nose, is so abhorrent to the natural and common feelings of humanity, that it may well be doubted whether any one but an hypochondriac or a lunatic could execute or conceive such a measure. Can any thing be more preposterous than the advice not unfrequently given, to “go to bed with the sun and get up with the sun?” It is clearly contrary to the visible intentions of Providence. Before the sun rises, the night dews lie heavy on field and forest. Nature is drenched: and the sun is kindly sent forth, as it were, to mop up the world, and make the earth dry and comfortable before it is necessary for its tenant, man, to come abroad. With his warm beams he proceeds in the work of exsuction, and draws up all the raw and unhealthy vapors out of our way: and any man who unnecessarily intrudes himself into his presence when thus transacting his morning's business, well deserves what he generally gets, a chilly reception and an inflammation of the lungs. Yet people will punish themselves in this way, and bear it all as if they were suffering in a good cause! If you remonstrate with them on their folly, they will take pen, ink, and paper, and prove to you, by the rules of arithmetic, how many years of active existence a man adds to his natural life by getting up regularly four hours before the rest of his fellow-mortals, only forgetting to deduct the four hours he loses by going to bed that much sooner, in order to indulge his strange, out-of-the-way propensities. If a cause is to be judged by its advocates, few, I believe, would stand worse than early rising. You never meet with what is called “a good fellow” among early risers. It is either your old bachelor, who is, to be sure, more excusable than any other class of men; or your morose worldly husband, who prides himself on his domestic virtues, because he sleeps over the fire after supper, and goes to bed at nine o'clock; or your thin, bilious, poetical and dyspeptic youth, who fancies he is an admirer of nature, and therefore comes abroad to see her in her most disagreeable forms, and also to beget an appetite for an extra egg or an additional muffin at breakfast. But the most amusing thing is, the credit such people take to themselves for these departures from the ordinary regulations of society. They invariably narrate the history of their morning exploits to one who loves his bed with an air of conscious rectitude, and with that “sort of satisfaction, Men feel when they have done a virtuous action,” though wherein consists the virtue of one man putting on his clothes three or four hours before another, 6* I am utterly unable to conjecture. But so it is, and they pride themselves upon it, as if it were one of the cardinal virtues, and like charity, covered a multitude of sins. My prejudices against this habit were greatly augmented by the shock my feelings received from witnessing it carried into effect on a highly improper occasion. I was, a summer or two ago, invited to a wedding, a few miles in the country, having an off-hand acquaintance with both bride and bridegroom. The former was very pretty and agreeable, the latter very pedantic and disagreeable. Many people thought him a genius, and he himself inclined to that opinion. He was busy with an epic poem, was an inflexible early riser, and invariably ate dyspepsia crackers at breakfast. His conversation always turned upon one subject, which was himself. This subject he divided into two parts, one of which was an unsparing narrative of his literary labors, and the other, a particular account of the state of his stomach. How he had contrived to steer between these two divisions, and carry on “his whole course of wooing,” I cannot comprehend. Be that as it might, a set of joyous spirits were congregated together at the wedding party. The wine circled gaily, and the song and jest passed merrily round. At a reasonable hour the ladies and junior and senior gentlemen retired, leaving about a dozen of us too well contented with things as they were to think of leaving them so soon. Time flew unheeded by, and the bright sun and four o'clock in the morning found us singing in full chorus, “Fly not yet, 'tis just the hour!” when happening to cast my eye into the garden, judge of my surprise at beholding our friend the “gay bridegroom,” perambulating the gravel walk a little way from the house. Struck with astonishment, I spoke not a word, but rushed from the room and made towards him, filled with fearful forebodings of some dire mishap. On my anxiously inquiring what was the matter, he seemed surprised at the question, and civilly stated “that nothing was the matter—that four o'clock was his usual time for getting up—that he found it conducive to health—that he had eaten three quarters of an ounce too much at supper—that the rising sun was a glorious spectacle, and that nothing aided the digestive powers so much as an early walk.” As he proceeded I looked in the reptile's inanimate face—there was not a spark of fire in his dull gray eye, his turned-up conceited-looking nose was tipped with blue, and I thought of the truth of what the scripture says, “we are but clay.” I remonstrated with him on the brutality and cruelty of his conduct; but he seemed to have no notion of endangering his health for the satisfaction of any created being; and I left the animal, or rather vegetable, sticking among the cabbages, admiring the beauties of nature, while I betook myself to my alas! solitary pillow. In the course of time two events occurred, one of which did not surprise me—the other did. My friend, the bridegroom's wife, insisted on a separate maintenance, and my friend, the bridegroom, published a volume of poems, which, upon opening, to my utter amazement, I found were almost all on amatory subjects. He discoursed of “love and dove,” and “kiss and bliss,” and strolls by moonlight, (he always went to bed at ten,) and ardent hopes and fiery passions, in a way that would have outdone Catullus and Thomas Moore, only that his were merely words without ideas, which certainly improved the innocence of the poems, however it might destroy their effect. There were also two or three bacchanalian songs, concerning “circling cups” and “rosy wine,” (he always drank cinnamon cordial diluted with water,) &amp;c. &amp;c. At the time of receiving this, I was busy with “an essay attempting to form a judgment of the characters of authors from their works.” I read half a dozen of my friend's poems, after which I folded up my manuscript, laid it on the fire, and said nothing more about the matter. Ever since that time I have entertained a decided abhorrence of early rising in every shape, and never contract an intimacy with any man who gets up before six in summer and seven in winter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SUMMER. The sultry summer days are come, the hottest of the year. Of lemonade, and iced cream, and spruce and ginger beer; Heaped in the wooden tea-gardens[2] [2] The term “wooden tea-gardens” may not be understood by some, but there are several such places in this city. The garden is composed of a number of small wooden boxes, in which all kinds of beverages are drunk excepting tea. the thirsty cits they drink, Then from their pockets draw their hands and slowly pay their chink. The cooling evening breeze comes not when the scorching sun has set. And fat men wipe their face and cry —“the warmest day as yet!” It was clearly shown by Hone, on his trial for parodying St. Athanasius's creed, that parodying any thing did not necessarily infer disrespect towards the thing parodied, and it is upon this ground that I take the above liberty with the beautiful lines of one of America's sweetest bards. Well, after a long, dull, hot and cold, equivocal spring—summer, fervid summer, has come in earnest. The minds of the citizens area at length relieved from the uncertainty which for two months pervaded them, namely, whether to fling the windows open, or order fire to be put into the grate; and the last slight lingering tinge of morning or evening chill has vanished away. Phœbus, for half the day now glares fiercely and intensely upon Broadway, and the hot flag-stones, retaining and reflecting his beams, burn the soles and crack the upper-leathers of the many boots and shoes that pass over them. The tide of emigration has set strongly in from the south, and sultry-looking planters are obliged to walk in the vicinity of dandy negroes, which by no means tends to cool their tempers. As the year rolls on, things good and bad come mingled together—fruit and flowers and drouth and dust— cloudless days and sleepless nights—scorching suns and southern breezes—musquitoes and Clara Fisher. A given quantity of prose and poetry, setting forth the good and bad qualities of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, is as periodical as the seasons. Spring seems to be the favorite of the poets, who themselves, for the most part, live upon hopes and promises, rather than substantialities, and have therefore a very natural sympathy with this very promising season. There certainly is something delightful in the general awakening of nature from the long dead sleep of winter; and the first blossoming of the flowers, the first warbling of the birds, and the genial warmth and freshness of the first spring days bear an inexpressible charm along with them; but to a worldly and unromantic disposition, partial to palpable realities, the taste of fruit is more acceptable than the scent of flowers, and a promise of a good thing not so good as the good thing itself. In so far summer is better than spring; but, in truth, despite of a calm temper and a thin jacket, the weather is horribly, I may say, awfully hot. Ladies are seen gliding down Broad-way clad in garments of “woven winds,” and gentlemen go perspiring and glistening along in white jean. Now are thick tufts of hair upon the cheeks found to be a serious inconvenience, and lo, the whiskerless rejoice! Now is the mercury in the sun at a fearful altitude, and the corporation are above fever-heat in the shade. Now are the citizens bent upon imparting useful information, and, as they meet, each “shakes his fellow by the hand,” and says unto him—“this is hot weather,” to which the other responds—“it is so!” and they pass on their way. Now do people, contrary to all custom, wish for “cold comfort,” desiring, like King John, to be “comforted with cold.” Now do the engine-men on board of steam-boats think lightly of the feats of Monsieur Chabert, the fire-king, wistfully do they gaze upon the river; and if a hissing, fizzing, whizzing sound is heard in the water, the captain cries out, “a man overboard!” Now do stout gentlemen, after a hearty dinner, look as if they were going through the process of distillation, “larding the lean earth as they walk along.” And now three impertinent questions in succession from any man is a legitimate excuse for assassination. Now are all kinds of fiery, passionate writing in disrepute, and Captain Parry's “Narrative of an Expedition to the North Pole” meets with a ready sale; and now do worthy editors unfeelingly request their correspondents to put pen to paper and draw forth the fevered thoughts of their fermenting brains. Now may all people, who persist in drinking unmixed brandy or Irish whiskey, be given up by the “Temperance Society.” Now are those who talk wrathful politics kicked out of society, and tragedy is eschewed as tending to heat the blood. Now do people prefer broiling at the springs to broiling in the city, and travel post-haste to keep themselves cool and comfortable, though, at the same time, an account in the newspapers of a man having voluntarily run a mile in ten minutes would be regarded as apocryphal. Now do editors cease to threaten to horsewhip each other, and a sedate drowsiness pervades their columns. And now VOL. II. 7 young ladies who are obliged to behave decorously, and mind their p's and q's in the presence of old withered maiden aunts on whom heat makes no more impression than on an Arab of the desert, are in a very uncomfortable situation. Now are long stories unlistened to and cayenne pepper disused. Now do cooks blaspheme, and dealers in fish and other perishable commodities are troubled in spirit. And now, in short, do nearly all the ills that heat can engender, afflict the perspiring inhabitants of this republic. My advice to them is—be patient and winter will come; or, what is equally to the purpose, though better expressed by some great moralist or other—“be virtuous, and you will be happy!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPICUREAN: A GASTRONOMIC TALE, INTERSPERSED WITH SUTTABLE REFLECTIONS. The qualms or raptures of your blood Rise in proportion to your food; And if you would improve your thought, You must be fed as well as taught. —Prior It was on the evening of a dull, damp, dreary, weary, melancholy, miserable day, towards the latter end of November, when Titus Dodds, esq., of Cornhill, merchant, closed his counting-house door, and proceeded homeward to his residence, No. 42 Brooke-street, High Holborn, in quest of palatable nutriment. The prospect before him was any thing but alluring. All surrounding substances, animate and inanimate, wore a most wretched and wo-begone aspect. The streets were greasy and slippery, the half-washed houses looked lonely and cheerless, while the Bank, the Mansion House, the Exchange, and other awkward and well-smoked edifices, as seen by the equivocal light of four o'clock, presented a peculiarly grim and repulsive appearance. The chilly, drizzly atmosphere penetrated to the very marrow of the shivering citizens as they crawled along to their respective domiciles, causing the most unpleasant alterations in the “human face divine;” cheeks and noses exchanged their appropriate tints; and many well-meaning, inoffensive people, whom their worst enemies could not charge with literary propensities, looked intensely blue. The shopmen sat behind their deserted counters, buried in profound meditation; street minstrels, vocal and instrumental, suspended their unfeeling persecutions; the starved, gaunt, miserable hackney and stage horses, from whose spavined limbs the “speed of thought” had long since departed, stood trembling, and ruminating doubtless on the “flowery fields and pastures green” of their infancy; while their red-visaged proprietors clustered together in small groups around the doors of the adjacent gin-shops, in impatient expectation of a customer. “A coach, sir, a coach!” cried a dozen voices, as Mr. Dodds approached; but he strode onward without deigning a reply, followed by the bitter maledictions of his disappointed fellow-creatures. But it is time some explanation was entered into of the character and habits of the hero of this history. Mr. Titus Dodds was a plain, honest, kind-hearted, sensible-enough sort of man. When a census of the population of the metropolis was taken, he counted one; but excepting on those occasions, never attempted to cut a figure in the world. If one asked his opinion respecting the domestic and foreign policy of the cabinet, he used to reply, that he was no politician; if another requested his views upon controversial points of religion, he would answer, that he was no theologian; and if any one desired to know his opinion concerning the probability of finding a passage round the North Pole, he would say, he thought it likely it might be discovered some time or other, adding, however, by way of qualification, that it was a great chance if it ever were. Holding these inoffensive tenets respecting law, divinity, politics, and science, and professing a total ignorance of poetry and the fine arts, he managed to get through the world with considerable ease and comfort to himself, and little or no inconvenience to his neighbors. As he was provided with an heiress to his small property, he was not troubled with the civilities and delicate attentions of friends and relatives; and as he made it a rule to keep out of debt, few people, of course, felt an interest in his fate. 7* Such was the appearance which Mr. Dodds presented to the superficial observer; and such indeed was his real character, as far as it went; but beneath all this placidity and quiescence lurked strong passions—ardent desires—unconquerable longings. It seemed as if all the sharp points of his character had flown off and concentrated themselves under one particular head. The fact is, Mr. Dodds liked his dinner; so much so, indeed, that were I inclined “to waver in my faith And hold opinion with Pythagoras,” I should surmise that the soul of the famous Parisian gourmand, the Abbe C.[3] [3] The Abbe C. doated on asparagus cooked with oil; the Abbe D. doated on asparagus cooked with butter. The Abbe D. called to dine with the Abbe C. when he had only a limited quantity of asparagus in the house, and no more was to be procured. They had been companions and friends from boyhood, and might be said, (figuratively) to have but one heart. What was to be done? The Abbe C. with more than Roman magnanimity, ordered half the asparagus to be cooked with oil—half with butter. Scarcely was the mandate issued, when the Abbe D. who was an apoplectic subject, took a fit and instantly expired in the sight of his agonized brother. What did the Abbe C. do in this case? With admirable presence of mind he flew to the head of the stairs and bawled to the cook—“do it all in oil—do it all in oil!” after quitting the body of that dignitary, had crossed the channel, made the best of its way to Brooke-street, High Holborn, and taken up its residence, for the time being, in the person of Mr. Titus Dodds. He was none of your showy, superficial fellows, that dilate with counterfeit rapture upon the pleasures of the table merely to gain credit for superior discrimination and delicacy of palate; he was none of your gastronomic puppies, that prate everlastingly of the impropriety and horrid vulgarity of brown meats and white wines—of the indelicacy of cheese, and the enormity of malted liquors. No—he was a man who had a real, simple, and sincere love for the birds of the air, the beasts of the field and the forest, and the fish of the seas, rivers, lakes, and fresh-water streams; and one gifted at the same time by nature, with an eminently lively sense of the pleasing essences and grateful flavors which are capable of being extracted therefrom. He did not like or dislike—or admire or abhor, according to the caprices or mutabilities of fashion. His tastes were formed by long experience, aided by much patient, minute, and subtle, though quiet and unobtrusive analyzation and investigation; and provided his dinner was to his liking, he cared little of what metallic substances those modern substitutes for fingers, yclept forks, were composed, or whether the number of their prongs corresponded with the prevalent notions of propriety on that subject. In fact, he was that rare thing—an independent man, without the slightest taint of obstinacy or stubbornness. Though not above learning from, he was no slave to the dogmas of cookery books; he honored their authors—he respected the labor and research displayed in their pages; but their most specious or authoritative doctrines were alike insufficient to shake his principles or unsettle his ideas of right and wrong. Like a wise man, he ate what he liked best, cooked as he liked it best, without the slightest reference to what the world in general, or his friends in particular, might say about the matter. To a philanthropist—to a man with an enlarged love for the human species, a Howard or a Shelly, it would have been a pleasing sight to see Mr. Titus Dodds, after the honorable fatigues of the day, sit down to what he most worshipped—ducks stuffed or impregnated with onions. To have marked the smile of calm though intense satisfaction which overspread the countenance of the good, middle-aged man, as he gazed upon them;—to have noticed the waters of pleasure involuntarily overflowing his eyes and trickling down his cheeks, as the delicious though pungent odors emitted from his favorites, steamed round his head and proceeded up his olfactory department to his brain;—to have listened to the long-drawn sigh (certainly not of sorrow,) with which he eased his o'erfraught breast, as he drew himself up to carve;—to have observed the slowness, or additional emphasis, with which he masticated the choice morsels—all this, I say, would have done their hearts good, and would have convinced even the veriest misanthrope, that the world was not altogether the huge den of misery which he took it to be; but that even the most humble and unknown individuals have often sources of pleasure within themselves, of some sort or other, which enable them to bear the burden of life with resignation, and lay it down at last, like the misanthrope himself, with reluctance. Titus Dodds (as has been previously mentioned,) was a man in easy circumstances, yet he had not often ducks for dinner. If any are curious to know the reason, it will be a sufficient reply—at least to the matrimonial portion of the querists—to state that Mr. Dodds was a married man. Mrs. Dodds was by no means a contradictious or contumacious helpmate; but still she had a will of her own; and in addition to this, notions had been infused into her by Mrs. Alderman Scales, the butcher's wife, regarding the extreme vulgarity of such a dish; and though Mrs. Dodds was a woman under the middle stature, she perfectly detested any thing low. Touching the onions, she was peculiarly pathetic in her remonstrances, inasmuch as they frequently brought tears to her eyes; but Titus was firm, and occasionally carried his point. He had succeeded in doing so on the day on which our story commences (and ends,) and the last words that ran along the passage, as he closed the door after him in the morning, were—“precisely at five.” But to return to Mr. Dodds, whom we left just entering Cheapside. Scarcely had he proceeded as far as Bow Church, when the dense fog, which had been brooding over the city for the last twelve hours, and resting itself on the tops of the more elevated buildings, came tumbling down all at once, bringing with it the whole of that day's smoke, which had been vainly endeavoring, since the first fire was lighted in the morning, to ascend to its usual station in the atmosphere. As soon as this immense funereal pall was spread over the city, things fell, as was naturally to be expected, into immediate and irremediable confusion. Pedestrian bore violently down upon pedestrian, and equestrian came in still more forcible contact with equestrian. Cart overturned cart—coach ran against coach— shafts were broken—wheels torn off—windows stove in; passengers shouted and screamed, and the language of the drivers, though copious and flowing, became characterized rather by energy than elegance. But a London fog cannot be described. To be appreciated it must be seen, or rather felt; for it is altogether impossible to be clear and lucid on such a subject. It is the only thing which gives you an idea of what Milton meant when he talked of “darkness visible.” There is a kind of light, to be sure, but it only serves as a medium for a series of optical delusions; and for all useful purposes of vision, the deepest darkness that ever fell from the heavens is infinitely preferable. A man perceives a coach a dozen yards off, and a single stride brings him among the horses' feet,— he sees a gas-light faintly glimmering (as he thinks) at a distance, but scarcely has he advanced a step or two towards it, when he becomes convinced of its actual station by finding his head rattling against the post; and as for attempting, if you get once mystified, to distinguish one street from another, it is ridiculous to think of such a thing. At the end of Cheapside there was a grand concussion of wheeled vehicles, and Mr. Dodds found some difficulty in preserving that intimate connexion which had so long satisfactorily subsisted between his mortal and immortal parts. The danger of being jostled, overturned, and trodden under foot, confused, unsettled, and perturbed his local ideas considerably, so that, instead of holding his way along Newgate-street, in a westerly direction, he pointed his nose due north, (up Aldersgate-street) and followed it according to the best of his ability. “They will be overdone!” soliloquized Titus; and he groped vigorously forward, until, as the clock struck the appointed hour of five, he found himself at the Angel at Islington, just about as far from his domicile as when he left his counting-house. There are limits to the power of language, and therefore I shall leave Mr. Dodds's state of mind, on making this singular discovery, to the imagination of the reader. But there was no time to be lost. He struck his ratan on the pavement, wiped the perspiration from his forehead, inquired out, as his nearest way, St. John's-street Road, and plunged at once into its mysterious recesses. 'Twere painful and vain to tell of his dismal and dubious wanderings in those complex regions which lie between the aforesaid road and Gray's Inn; suffice it to say, that he at length succeeded in reaching the latter, and began once more to entertain hopes of seeing his home again, when he became aware of something in his path, and a voice from the mist thus broke upon his ear:— “Heaven bless your honour! poor Pat O'Connor, Ploughing on the sea, Lost his precious sight, by lightning in the night! Poor Pat O'Connor begs for charity! Ah! give him one poor halfpenny!” Mr. Dodds was a patriotic man; in his way; and a disabled prop of the naval power of his country seldom appealed to him in vain, but, on this occasion, he passed on, and the man with no eyes paused in his strain to bestow a passing benediction on those of Mr. Dodds. “For the love of mercy spare a trifle to a poor widow with seven small children,” said a miserable object seated on a door-step. Mr. Dodds was a charitable man, but he delayed not. “Mind that are puddle, sir, and valk over this 'ere plank,” vociferated a little scrub-headed urchin, the proprietor of a frail deal board, which he had placed across “the meeting of the waters” from two or three street-ends, to benefit travelers, and serve his own pecuniary purposes. Titus did so, and passed over the confluence of the kennels dry-shod. “Remember the accommodation plank, sir,” bawled the boy, half-imploringly, half-indignantly, as he perceived Mr. Dodds's body in motion on the opposite side. Dodds was far from being an ungrateful man, but he sought not for copper. At length, panting, wearied, worried, and worn out, he found himself, as the clock struck six, at Middle Row, Holborn, a full quarter of a mile from his habitation. A skilful portraiture of human suffering, up to a certain point, is far from unpleasing, and rather VOL. II. 8 beneficial, arousing, as it does, the hidden sympathies of our nature which might otherwise remain dormant; but when it passes this point, when it becomes of agonizing intenseness, minute description is then shocking and repulsive. We will, therefore, quit Mr. Dodds for the present, and shift the scene to his residence. The accumulated wisdom of ages has recorded that there is nothing so deceitful as appearances. The chilliness and serenity of the outside of Mount Etna give not the slightest hint of the volcanic fires roaring and raging within; and as little did the demure, quiet appearance of 42 Brooke-street, High Holborn, betoken the agitation which prevailed therein. The causes of this agitation were threefold. Mr. Dodds, as has been before stated, ordered dinner precisely at five, and as his wife, clock, and cook, were tolerably well regulated, there was a reasonable prospect of his saying grace about that time. But wives are not infallible—clocks are not chronometers—cooks are not impeccable. Mrs. D. had been flatteringly invited to give her opinion upon some new purchases of Flander's lace, made by her neighbor Mrs. Blenkinsopp. Where lives the woman that can tear herself from lace? The consequence was, that Mrs. Dodds was half an hour past her time in issuing her orders to the cook; the cook was discussing the benefits derivable from triennial parliaments with the aforesaid Mrs. Blenkinsopp's housemaid, who was a septennialist, and a quarter of an hour more was lost without settling the question after all. To crown the whole, the clock, which had heretofore conducted itself in a commendable manner, thought proper to come to a full stop, and ten minutes elapsed before the cook was aware of the resolution it had taken. As soon as Mrs. Dodds became fully conscious of this unfortunate concurrence of circumstances, the house, as the saying is, “was hardly large enough to hold her,” although it contained many apartments of respectable proportions. What a short-sighted creature is man! He knows not what is best for him. Had Mr. Dodds only been aware of these seeming misfortunes, how would he have felicitated himself on this eventful evening. Seven minutes had now elapsed since the authoritative voice of St. Giles's had bawled out to the surrounding districts, “six o'clock,” and Mrs. Dodds began to be seriously alarmed at the most unaccountable absence of Mr. Dodds; so much so, indeed, that faint visions of the unbecomingness of widow's caps kept involuntarily flitting across her imagination. Being a notable, prudent personage, she placed her smelling-bottle on the table, laid her white muslin-cambric handkerchief beside it, and arranged the easy armchair at a convenient distance so that she might not be found altogether unprepared, in case it was announced to her that she was a desolate woman. Just at this juncture, however, the street-door opened, and a heated, flurried, perspiring piece of animated nature, bearing a striking resemblance to Mr. Dodds, rushed in, and made the best of its way to the drawing-room, but nothing (at least to the purpose) met its eager glance. “They can never have eaten them,” exclaimed Dodds, (for it was he)—“Oh no, no, no!—they could not, would not, durst not!”—and, without tarrying for the slow medium of servants, in order to effect a communication with Mrs. Dodds, away he sallied, in order to know the worst at once, in quest of his stray lamb—or, to speak with greater agricultural precision, his ewe, for she was long past the flowery days of lambhood. “Titus Dodds!” cried Mrs. Dodds, (she called him “Titus” in her loving or juvenile moods; “Dodds,” when she wished to be familiar; “Mr. Dodds,” when she was ill-tempered or imperious, and “Titus Dodds,” when she aimed at being singularly impressive,) “Titus Dodds, where have you been?” “It matters not,” replied Titus, in a tremulous voice, “it matters not! I suppose all is over, and there is nothing but cold meat in the house—well, well!” Far be it from me to violate the sanctity of domestic privacy, by detailing the conversation which ensued. It is sufficient to say that a mutual and satisfactory explanation took place—the ducks were finally served up, done to a turn, and Titus Dodds was indeed a happy gentleman. The partner of his past life contemplated the subdued rapture depicted in the countenance of the man of her choice, as if she were very well satisfied with the turn affairs had taken; while their pretty daughter Bessy, a lively girl, with an amazing relish for a piece of snug humor, paused in the midst of a cut off the breast, took in the pleasantry of the scene at a glance, and then went on with her occupation. It was, as I said before, a scene that a philanthropist would, indeed, have gloried in contemplating. “Oh happiness! our being's end and aim!” how strangely and incongruously dost thou mix thyself up with the fabric of things! Wealth and power, and glory, ofttimes give thee not, and yet thou may'st be extracted (as has been shown) from even the commonest commodities. Independent creature!—the 8* high and mighty magnates of the earth command thee to their footstools, but thou turnest up thy nose, and strayest away unto some peasant's homely hearth; and, when it so pleaseth thee, thou leavest the emperor on his throne, the peer in his palace, the beauty in the ball room, and takest up thy abode in uninviting habitations, amid the nameless children of obscurity. Democratic divinity! I gratefully worship thee, for I am even now sensible of thy presence; and it may be, that thou hast, this very night, deserted the luscious soups and fragrant wines of some luxurious alderman, to hover over the simple mutton-chop and sparkling bottled ale, that await my acceptance, as soon as I have attached my brief and insignificant signature to this humble tale, destitute of a plot and unprotected by a moral.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TOBACCO. In all countries, Christian, Mahomedan, Jewish and Pagan, some foolish abomination or other has, in the dark ages, sprung up amongst the people, no one knows how, and been perpetuated, no one knows why. It is not my intention to illustrate the art of spinning-out in writing, and impose upon the public by entering into minute details, and citing grave authorities from cyclopædias, to show how the followers of the prophet first came to eat opium, the inhabitants of Cochin China whang-te, or any other parallel case, but confine myself closely to the subject more immediately under consideration—a subject which, it may be said, is in every man's mouth, and “comes home to the bosom and business of all.” It is strange what a strong propensity nature has implanted in the human species, from infancy to old age, to convey all sorts of substances into that orifice which serves as a port of entry for the stomach. Even the small weeping and wailing babe, no sooner grasps with its tiny and unsteady hand any thing eatable, than its cries are stilled, and it carries it instinctively to its mouth; while, beyond all question, a mother's most infallible recipe for assuaging the grief of the hardy urchins around her, is a substantial slice of bread and butter. It is pleasant to note the sudden transition from grief, or rather mechanical crying, to joy, which takes place in a little fellow as soon as a pacifying piece of victuals is placed in his hand. How his face lightens up, and his bright eyes sparkle and glisten through the moisture which overflows them, while ever and anon the “big round tears” unconsciously leave his silken eyelashes, and “Course one another down his innocent nose.” It is a pretty study for a painter. The capacities for eating possessed by young children at a tender age are immense—many of the young rouges will continue stuffing from the rising to the going down of the sun, with a gusto calculated to excite the astonishment of an epicure and the horror of a valetudinarian. The swallowing capabilities of a man, however, are by no means so great, though his early objections to letting his jaw-bones remain in a quiescent state continue equally strong; he has, therefore, adopted various ways of indulging this propensity without danger to himself, and among these, masticating tobacco stands strikingly conspicuous in this section of the globe. To such an extent is this carried, that not only are thousands of acres of fertile land devoted to the purpose of raising it, but ships are fitted out and sent across the ocean; and men, esteemed by statesmen and philosophers of an inferior order on account of their color, are torn from their home and wives and children, in order to cultivate a weed for other men of another color to put into their mouths and then take out again! To me tobacco appears a very unodoriferous and anti-poetical substance. To rebut the latter charge it may be urged that Byron, the greatest poet of the age, was partial to it; but it must be remembered that Byron used it only as a medicine— an antidote to rotundity—in small round balls, in order to allay the pangs of hunger when his lordship chose to fast, to prevent his growing, like Falstaff, “out of all compass—out of all reasonable compass.” No—tobacco is death to poetry and poetical associations wherever it comes in contact with them. Fancy, for an instant, a fine clear sabbath morn in some of the snug sheltered villages on the Connecticut river, the bell from the simple spire summoning the hardy yeomanry, far and near, to the house of prayer. Fancy a venerable old man trudging along the narrow pathway that runs winding through the sweet-scented meadows which lie betwixt his home and the spot consecrated to the service of his Maker, with his smiling happy family tripping gaily at his heels. He feels the benign influence of nature in the balmy air, and is glad, though he almost deems cheerfulness a sin at such a time, while the rising generation find their hearts leaping with frolic glee as the delicious southern breeze, laden with the merry music of birds and the breath of flowers, comes sweeping over the bold hills and beautiful valleys. There is poetry, deep and pure, in such a sight. But suppose, for an instant, the old man, or any part of the male progeny, “chew”—faugh! what a jar it gives the feelings—it is like a discord in a strain of music, or a blot from a sign-painter's brush on one of Turner's landscapes. It brings you at once from the poetry of life to the harsh prose— the scurvy reality—and you see nothing but an old farmer and his tobacco-munching sons lounging along, employed in transferring large quantities of that detestable weed from one side of their mouths to the other, and ever and anon staining the bright young grass and pretty wild-flowers with their impure squirtations as they pass on their way. Much is said of the influence which females exercise in this country, but it is, we fear, over-rated. Powerful as may be their commands and entreaties, and strong as may be their charms; it is reasonable to suppose that the charms of tobacco are still stronger, or they would doubtless have banished it from civilized society long ere this. It is shocking to think of a delicate creature with lips “like two young rose-leaves torn,” having them at any time come in contact with those attached to what out of courtesy is called the mouth of a man, but which, in reality, is nothing better than a damp tobacco-box. Yet there is much kissing going on in the world for all this. It is curious what strange and childish notions will perpetuate an evil. Drinking, gambling, &amp;c. are enticing in the first instance, but all agree that the use of tobacco is dreadfuly disagreeable to the young beginner; yet boys will imitate the actions of men; unfortunately it is considered manly to swear, drink mint juleps, eat tobacco, and smoke cigars; and thousands of beardless, puny creatures are led away by the desire to appear older than they are. Poor children! Why do not their parents whip them and put them to bed early for doing such naughty, filthy tricks? Solomon says, “he that spareth the rod spoileth the child;” and it would be better for themselves and their offspring, if the worthy inhabitants of this city would pay a little more respect to Solomon's sayings; though, alas, with what consistency can a man correct his son for the very abominations he himself indulges in? It must be left to that indefinite power of education which it is the fashion of the hour to set forth as a remedy for all disorders and irregularities. One thing is clear; so much expectoration must be highly injurious to half-grown boys, and many of them, with wasp waists and the mere outlines of a face, look as if the liquor they are so fond of extracting had mingled with the current of their young blood, and was the cause of tobacco-colored complexions. We are very sorry for Messrs. Lorillard, but, as small political editors with seventeen bad subscribers say —“our duty to the public imperatively commands us to speak out.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BOY-MEN AND GIRL-WOMEN. These are two species of the human family not yet distinctly classed or named by naturalists, and must, therefore, be designated by compounds. The individuals which compose them, are hovering between the last stages of boy and girlhood, and the first dawnings of a more mature state of existence full-grown children, or incipient men and women. They are the unfinished portions of humanity which poets and sentimentalists have, from time immemorial, sung and said so much about, though for what especial reason is more than many worldly people are able to discover. Poets are fine fellows; but a love of truth, or a desire to represent things as they really are, is not to be found in the list of their good qualities. They warp and twist their materials, to suit their own purposes, more than a theological disputant or a petty sessions lawyer, and build a towering structure on a slighter foundation VOL. II. 9 than a purblind antiquary. They are much given to the use of hypotheses; and after they have once supposed that a thing can be so, they immediately set it down that it is so. Exaggeration is another of their foibles:—with them a glimpse of goodness signifies perfection, and a glimmering of sin the essence of iniquity; and it is in consequence of this that they come to make such delightful and diabolical pictures out of nothing at all. Some of the cleverest of them have, at one period or other of their lives, met with two or three charming young girls, just “bursting into womanhood,” or a few intelligent boys, and, being great generalizers, they have taken it for granted that all were so; and thus it has come to pass in English poetry, that this is celebrated as the most delectable stage of existence. It is a state that may or may not be pleasant enough to those who are passing through it, but it is by no means productive of much pleasure and gratification to those with whom they come in contact; and whatever prose or poetry may say to the contrary, I think worldly experience will bear me out in upholding that boy-men and girl-women, are neither more nor less than bores of very considerable magnitude. The girl-woman is generally a rather pretty creature, dressed in something between a frock and a gown, made of white muslin, with a pink sash round her waist. Her face has lost the free and unembarrassed expression of childhood, without having obtained the self-possession and dignity of woman. The graces of her person are as yet but half developed; her shoulders are sharp and angular, and her arms long and unpleasantly slender. She is too mature to wear her hair in a crop, and too childish to have it piled in towers of curls and combs on the top of her head. Indeed, let her dress be what it may, it appears alike unfit for the stage through which she has just passed, or the one on which she is about to enter. Her intellectual faculties and conversation are in an equally uncertain state; and the person who addresses her is sorely puzzled how to hit the right medium between juvenility and maturity. She has not made up her mind whether she likes Byron or skipping-rope best; but decidedly prefers Mrs. Opie to the author of Waverley. If you talk of school, you offend her; and yet she knows not how to discourse about any thing else—so that all the conversation consists of an abrupt observation and an embarrassed rejoinder. If she can be prevailed upon to venture more than six syllables at a time, she has a bad habit of speaking unpleasant truths, and afterwards looking distressingly conscious, not exactly knowing whether she has done right or wrong. She sits on her chair, holding in one hand a white pocket-handkerchief, and not a little perplexed what to do with the other; with an eternal simper hanging around her mouth, ready to be aggravated into a laugh upon the most trivial occasion. If any body tells a joke with a grave face, she looks grave too; but is mightily tickled with the hymeneal allusions and matrimonial witticisms of which the more mature part of the company are delivered. She does not understand or appreciate worldly knowledge, yet she has school learning enough to find you out if you talk foolishly. In short, she is altogether in a very unsettled state, filled with childish reminiscences and womanly aspirations, and is, when a man feels grave or low-spirited, one of the most unendurable annoyances with which he can well be afflicted. But if your girl-woman is an undesirable individual, your boy-man is one of the greatest nuisances in civilized society. There is something charming about the female sex at almost every period of their existence; and even in town a very young lady, though certainly a subject for apprehension, has some redeeming points; while in the country, after a scamper in the fields, or a chase after a bird or butterfly, with her eyes filled with fire and animation, her cheeks glowing with health and exercise, her clustering curls dancing in the wind, and her pretty bonnet hanging loosely and carelessly on the back part of her head, she is a truly beautiful and poetical object. But your boy-man is a monster wherever you meet with him. In the country he is an “unlicked cub,” a lout, a bumpkin; in town, a half made up coxcomb, an unfinished puppy, a thing with nearly all the vices and follies of a man, without his sense or passions. It is his oath that rings loudest in the tavern, and his tongue that is most clamorous in its demands for strong drink to destroy his puny constitution, merely because he thinks it looks manly. He is altogether a foolish and contemptible creature; for even his vicious habits do not afford him pleasure. He does not, like the real voluptuary, “roll sin like a sweet morsel under his tongue;” but he counterfeits bad habits, and will drink and smoke, though both be unpleasant to him and make him sick, merely because older people do so; and this it is which prevents him from ever becoming what it is the height of his ambition to appear—a man. Then the swearing of these grown children is perfectly disgusting. From a man, borne away by passion, or from an old sailor, to whom it has become a trick of custom, and who, moreover, seems a sort of perperson privileged to wish his eyes no good, a few 9* anathemas do not come with so bad a grace; but to hear these would-be men repeating, like parrots, all the vulgar oaths that low blackguardism has invented and perpetuated, merely because they have arrived at the dignity of shaving, is very nauseous. These too are the small fry that swarm about billiard-rooms and theatre-lobbies; that open box-doors and stand in the doorways adjusting their ringlets, much to the discomfort of shivering ladies and rheumatic old gentlemen, imagining all the time that the eyes of the whole audience are turned to the particular spot which they occupy. They are, indeed, take them altogether, simply the most empty, impudent, noisy, impertinent, obtrusive set of varlets that can be imagined, and are not ashamed of any thing—except having no whiskers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OLD ENGLISH COMEDIES. “Comedy is a graceful ornament to the civil order; the Corinthian capital of polished society. Like the mirrors which have been added to the sides of one of our theatres, it reflects the images of grace, of gaiety, and of pleasure double, and completes the perspective of human life.” The above sentence, it is presumed, was written with reference to the comedies that held possession of the stage in the days of our unenlightened ancestors, some century and a half ago; for, if applied to the three and five-act farces which modern manufacturers impudently baptize by the name of “comedies,” and which the present generation are well contented to receive as such, instead of a graceful truth, it becomes a piece of caustic irony, from the pointed severity of which neither the public nor the playwrights of the year eighteen hundred and twenty-nine have wherewithal to shield themselves. Without at all canting about the “good old times,” it must be conceded on all hands, that whatever may have been the faults and deficiencies of our ancestors, and however well assured the present self-sufficient race of mortals may feel, of their general superiority, they are at present at an immeasurable distance behind them in every department of dramatic literature, but more particularly in comedy. Formerly a comedy was a work of genius— a green leaf added to the literary coronal of the land; it was then composed of sparkling wit and rare invention—of characters rich and racy, yet natural; and of incidents gay and sprightly, yet probable; and was, indeed, a mirror to show “the very age and body of the time, its form and pressure.” Now, what is a comedy? Messrs. Morton, Peake, and Poole can best answer that question. “Ay, tell us that, and unyoke.” It is a thing where the broad and coarse extravagancies of farce are jumbled together with mawkish and lachrymose sentimentality, where the characters are caricatures vilely executed, and the incidents precisely such as could not by any possibility ever have taken place— where the dialogue consists of puns, slang, stray jests, and flowers of rhetoric from the circulating libraries, with a copious infusion of ordinary slip-slop conversation—where the jokes are all practical, and stumbling over a chair, or drawing out a ragged pocket-handkerchief, are among the happiest inventions of the author; and though, at times, a few gleams of humor may shine athwart the gloom, yet wit, who is a little more aristocratical and choice in his company, absents himself altogether. And what is it that makes this farrago of abominations escape the fate decreed against all sinful transgressions? It is stage effect. To this every thing is sacrificed— this the authors have studied, and this they understand, and hence the secret of their disgraceful success. It is not meant, however, to be said, that this and this alone strictly applies to the three gentlemen mentioned above, though any one who will take the trouble of reading their works, (particularly Morton's) will find that a great part may be truly applied to most of their productions. They are mentioned by name because they are the three best of the numerous herd of stage writers of the present day; and Poole, in his Paul Pry, has even given us a glimpse of better things. True, the dialogue in that piece is meagre enough, but there is a good deal of broad humor and no sentiment; the situations are extremely laughable, and the character of the inquisitive Mr. Pry himself very cleverly sketched. It would be well if we had more pieces like this, instead of such plays as “Town and Country,” which Kean honored and brought into notice by personating the mouthing and melancholy hero, and which example many clever actors have since inconsiderately followed. But, alas! for the dashing gallants and wits that glitter in the pages of Wycherly, Congreve, Vanburgh, and Farquhar. Their day, it would seem, is gone for ever; and what have we in their place? Look at modern comedy, and in nine cases out of ten you will find a variety of the “Tom and Jerry” species for its hero;—some heedless spendthrift, worthless but not witty enough for a rake; who commits all sorts of folly with impunity through the space of five acts, and then ends by laying his five fingers on his bosom, and informing the dramatis personæ in general, and the young lady in white, whose hand he of course receives, in particular, that “though his head may have erred, his heart is still in the right place!” What the deuce have the audience to do with his heart? It is from his head that they expect entertainment, and if they are disappointed in that, what satisfaction to them, after the infliction of his slang and impertinence in the place of genuine wit and spirit, is the information that he intends to reform and live decently and soberly with his wife? But objections, and in some instances, on good grounds, have been raised to the representation of the older dramatists, on the score of indelicacy; though it is one which might easily be obviated by judicious pruning; and, after all, the gay and polished libertinism of some of the old comedies is not half so indelicate, and not one quarter so disgusting, as the vulgar liberties so frequently taken with modern would-be fastidious audiences, and which they not only suffer, but chuckle over with evident satisfaction. But the old comedies have a bad character on this account, and we all know the force of the proverb “give a dog a bad name,” &amp;c. There is too much truth in what a clever writer has said, that “the cant of delicacy has done thrice the injury to the drama that sheer downright fanaticism has ever done; and shallow refinement is ten times more hopelessly inaccessible than the prejudices of the narrowest bigotry.” Even George Colman the younger, who ought to have known better, and who in his younger days was by no means fastidious, has joined in the pestilential cry, that has been one great cause of driving the gay and sparkling Thalia from the stage, and substituting a Merry Andrew in her place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IMITATION. All men are of opinion that they have a will of their own, and nothing vexes them more than any assertion to the contrary. The great majority are “led by the nose as easy as asses are;” yet as they trot along in the wake of some shrewd fellow, who is in turn led by some still shrewder than himself, they actually imagine themselves free agents, that their opinions are their own, and that their actions are the result of those opinions. This delusion is universal and very complete, and, (heaven knows the reason,) it appears to be the most provoking thing in the world to awaken any one from it. Tell a man that he is a sad profligate, and he is proud of the appellation; but tell him he is an honest well meaning gentleman, though somewhat liable to be guided by the example of others rather than his own judgment, and he gets into a perfect fury, and asks you what you take him for? A monkey is an imitative animal, but nothing to a man, who is at once the most servile copyist in creation, and a sturdy asserter of his moral independence— a being who tells you it is his pleasure to do so and so, because “every body does so.” He sacrifices his ease and convenience, to do as other people do; and eats, drinks, and sleeps, not when it suits himself, but when it pleases others. The fashion of the hour is a moral despotism, whose omnipotent decrees he dares not dispute, however curious a figure he may cut in obeying its mandates. The effect of this is often singular in consequence of the inappropriateness of the fashion to the individual, or the unhappy attempts of the individual to assimilate with the fashion. In dress, for instance, it is strikingly so. Some lady and gentleman of sufficient notoriety to entitle them to “set the fashion” for the season, array themselves in such garments as they think best adapted to their figure and complexion, and such as will give prominency to their beauties, and throw into the shade their defects. As soon as they have arranged this to their satisfaction, it becomes “the mode;” and the whole tribe of bipeds, great and small, thick and thin, short and tall, judiciously follow their example without any reference to the shape or color heaven has given them. You will see a brunette blackening her complexion by bringing it in violent contrast with straw-color and lilac, VOL. II. 10 because it is the fashion; and a blonde, looking sickly and consumptive, by having glaring orange, purple, or dark green, in the vicinity of her delicate skin:—you will see a long column of humanity, of no thickness at all, with a broad-brimmed beaver on his head, and a sporting-jacket on his back; and a short, pursy, corpulent individual waddling along in a swallow-tailed coat and steeple-crowned hat, all because it is the fashion! Yet these people imagine they have a will of their own. In literature the imitative principle has been, and is, in full operation, though it is perhaps half intentional and half unconscious. A master-spirit starts from the crowd of men, strikes out some new course, ranges through unexplored and unthought of regions, and there reigns an object of wonder and admiration. Immediately a whole troop of pigmies attempt to tread in his giant footsteps, imitate his faults, exaggerate his defects, and imagine, before they advance one step up the hill of fame, that they are nearly at its summit. It will be in the remembrance of all, when Byron was in the zenith of his glory, what an immense quantity of second-hand misanthropy was afloat among the poetasters; how they all set to work to draw their own portraits for the amusement of the public, and what a precious set of good-for-nothing vagabonds they made themselves out to be. They were all, according to their own story, made up of splendid errors and useless virtues, and were unanimously unhappy. It was for a time a most ludicrous evil; for nothing can be more ridiculous than to see a small mind playing the egotist, and describing the agony of its feelings at the same time that it is hunting for a rhyme, and seeing that the line contains the requisite number of syllables. This folly has in a great measure past away; and the Waverley imitation fever, which succeeded, has been much more rational in its motives, and creditable in its results. True, historical novels have become almost as much a drug in the market as fashionable ones. The public is beginning to get tired of the portraits of defunct kings, queens, and courtiers; and the number of great men that have been resuscitated and made to speak in the first person singular, has become alarming. Indeed, our novelists are perfect literary resurrection-men. Many persons, because the great magician, Walter Scott, can raise the spirits of the past, and make them act and speak as they were wont, think they can do the same—but the public do not. It is far from pleasant to see these liberties taken with the mighty dead, except by one as mighty as any of them, Shakspeare excepted. Still there has been much talent, learning, and research displayed in works of this description, by Horace Smith, Mr. James, and others, which might have gained for their authors great credit with posterity, as they have already with the present generation, had not their merits been overshadowed by those of their immortal prototype. As it is, they will as surely go to the “oblivious cooks” as every word of this essay will be forgotten next week by the people who read it. For our own poor taste, after Sir Walter Scott, in the present age, give us Washington Irving's portraits of great dead men. His Wouter Von Twiller, William Klieft, and Peter Stuyvesant, are three as finished pictures in the fine, quiet, rich old Dutch school as any one need wish to look upon. But the greatest field for imitation is theatricals, and here it is of the very worst species. The beauties of a great actor are never attempted to be copied; they are too difficult; but any unfortunate peculiarity or bad and vicious habit is seized upon with avidity and fondly cherished. Because John Kemble was troubled with an asthmatic complaint, all the Rollas, Catos, and Hamlets that came for some time after him were likewise troubled with asthma, and a short dry cough; with Macready came the almost ridiculous stateliness of gesture and fastidious arrangement of the garments, without any of his fine qualities; and Kean's fame has been the means of introducing many a young man on the stage, who could do nothing but imitate those little Keanisms and physical defects which occasionally disfigured his beautiful intellectual acting. A would-be vocalist, with the voice of a raven, thinks himself a good deal like Braham, because in singing he can hold his hat precisely as he does, and has succeeded in catching a few of that gentleman's peculiarly awkward gestures. Talking of singing—is the prevailing admiration of Italian music and performances counterfeit or real, or a little of both? Is it in imitation of the English who imitate the French in this respect, or is it a genuine indigenous feeling? The Italian is a noble school of music, and it would be gratifying to perceive a gradual relish for it; but it is apt to create mistrust to see the exuberance of admiration expressed for it all of a sudden by a large party of people, nineteen-twentieths of whom are neither familiar with the music nor the language; and we are afraid there is some truth in the anecdote now whispered round the city, of a party of musical cognoscenti having been thrown into a fit of enthusiasm by what they supposed to be an Italian gentleman's manner of giving a composition of Cimarosa's, but which, words and air, eventually turned out to be a genuine Welch ditty, howled out by one Taffy ap Shenkin, 10* of Glamorganshire! Certain it is, that many things pass off with great eclat when sung in a foreign language by signors, signoras, or signorinas, which would sound viley from the mouth of plain Mr. Jobson, Mrs. Brown, or Miss Dobbs. The blunt tradesman had really some reason to be astonished when on inquiring if “signorina” did not literally mean in Italian “great singer,” he was given to understand that it was merely equivalent to the simple English word “Miss.” We recollect a gentleman of the name of Comer, formerly of this city, who used to sing an Italian air with American words to it—“When the banners of freedom are waving”—without producing any marked effects; but no sooner did the same gentleman replace the Italian words, “Non piu andrai,” than it was instantly recognised as something extremely fine, and vociferously encored. Now, without meaning to undervalue worthy foreigners who reach these shores, it is probable that there is no small quantity of affectation in the admiration expressed for them, and that the majority applaud without having any definite idea on the subject, in imitation of the few who are supposed to know. Such foreigners are, at the same time, both overrated and not sufficiently appreciated—overrated as a whole, and not appreciated in detail, for what is really meritorious. Our harsh northern dialect may not be so well adapted to musical composition as that of the “sweet south,” but it does not follow that every Italian composition and singer must of necessity be superlatively fine; and allowing our general inferiority, a song in a language which a man understands, will always, affectation aside, be more grateful to his ear than the mere tinkle of soft sounds. The one, indeed, goes no further than the ear, while the other, through the medium of the understanding, reaches the heart, and any song that does so is worth twenty others that do not. If people would take the trouble to consult their own judgments, feelings, and common sense on such subjects, instead of being carried away by vague ideas and learned-looking words, they would find it to their interest; as it is, they let others inoculate them with opinions which in time they come to believe their own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AN EVENING AT THE THEATRE. It is a pleasant thing for any one who is fond of plays and players, after the cares and business of the day are satisfactorily over, to find himself snugly ensconced in a quiet and comfortable corner of a box five minutes previous to the rising of the curtain, with a fair prospect of three or four hours' rational amusement before him. An evening so spent is good for the health, spirits, and understanding, and leaves the morals just about where it found them, neither much better nor worse. The stage, like every thing that has been made much the subject of controversy, has been greatly overrated, both for good and for evil, especially in regard to the impression it makes upon a gentleman's virtue. Its opponents have accused it of clearing a man's morals out of him in the most wholesale and expeditious manner; while its advocates, in the opposite extreme, contend that it possesses the singular property of filling a person with as much morality as he can well hold; and rather more, indeed, than he can decently and profitably get along with, as this world is constituted, without injuring his wife and family, and being obliged to “eat his mutton cold.” The truth is, that both parties have written more nonsense about the matter, than is wholesome to read; and both have volunteered much solemn foolishness and ill-tempered declamation in their zeal to serve the cause of truth. The one will gravely cite as an argument, and a case in point, that “the three young men who lately robbed their employers to a considerable amount, were very frequently in the habit of attending the theatre;” to which they might, with equal propriety and sagacity, have added, that these three young men were regularly in the habit of eating their dinner, and that the greatest depredator had long evinced a strange and suspicious partiality for roast pig; the one being as logical a deduction of effects from causes as the other. Then the Solomons, on the opposite tack, balance this by quoting certain cases, where “Guilty creatures, sitting at a play, Have, by the very cunning of the scene, Been struck so to the soul, that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions;” as if a chance word spoken in a church or a tavern, a hay-field or a fish-market, might not just as easily have touched the tender point, and awakened “That power within the guilty breast Oft vanquish'd, never quite suppressed, That unsubdued and lurking lies, To take the felon by surprise, And force him, as by magic spell, In his despite his guilt to tell.” Another favorite argument with those who denounce the stage is, that vice is often not sufficiently punished or virtue rewarded. But does this never happen in real life? and who is then to blame? It certainly does, and much more frequently off the stage than on; for dramatic authors in general, make no scruple of sacrificing both probability and possibility in their zeal to mete out poetical justice to the misbehaved persons of the drama. That man's principles must be very weak and wavering who can be swayed either one way or the other by a few words, and the passing of a picture before his eyes; and he must have a strong natural bias towards roguery, who finds his virtue giving way on seeing a vicious gentleman now and then get off scot-free on the stage. Such a one is not a whit safer in witnessing the proceedings of a court of justice; because, though nineteen rogues out of twenty be condemned, the twentieth may hold out a temptation to iniquity, by escaping in consequence of a flaw in the indictment. For my own part, I am well content to spend a few hours pleasantly at the theatre, without fretting about whether there has been any visible addition to my small stock of virtue, provided it does not suffer diminution. Men's morals are not like coal fires, requiring to be constantly stirred up and trimmed, to prevent their dying away or going out entirely. But let who will argue or declaim, it is, as we said at first, a pleasant thing, after a day spent in harassing and jangling pursuits, to pass an evening at the theatre, and is as refreshing to the mind as a warm bath to the body, clearing away the little petty cares and vexations that business is so apt to engender and leave behind. Like the bath, it is only relaxing and enervating when immoderately indulged. There are more important things than plays—even the best of them—in the world, and it is by no means a good sign to see a young man lounging about a theatre. His education ought to be completed, and his mind stored with dry though necessary facts and useful information, before he takes an unlimited range into that region of passion and imagination, else, in the voyage of life he will be as a light bark with more canvas than ballast, on a stormy sea, liable to be upset by every squall that blows. But to a tolerably well regulated mind, what mines of inexhaustible and invaluable wealth are concealed behind that green curtain. Beyond that the bloody Richard and gallant Percy, the wronged Othello, the moralizing Jaques, the monster Caliban, the mediatative Hamlet, honest Jack Falstaff and ancient Pistol—merry Rosalind, the pretty Perdita, the gentle Desdemona, and how many other thousands of pure and base, and great and glorious spirits having a living visible existence! There the spirit-stirring passages gleaned from records of antiquity are treasured up, and the warriors and sages of old again live and breathe, in the picture of the poet. The curtain rises, and lo! spare Cassius and gentle Brutus again walk the streets of Rome. The centuries that have elapsed are as nothing, and the spectator is present at the fall of “mighty Cæsar.” Or a drum is heard, and the thane of Cawdor once more treads the “blasted heath,” to be met by the prophetic greetings of the weird sisters. Now if a man be not very wise, and altogether above being instructed by Shakspeare and other worthies, there is certainly something to be learnt from this, and such as this. The drama is, in truth, a stupendous creation; and let its decriers say what they may, it will ever remain amongst the proudest and mightiest works of civilized man. True, all is not gold that glitters, and with the pure ore of Shakspeare, and the brilliant sparkling gems of Congreve and Sheridan, are mixed up the tinsel of Reynolds and the brass of Morton; but they are easily separated by those who are not afflicted with a total mental blindness, and to those who are, the one is just as good as the other. But, independently of the stage, what ample scope for study and observation does the audience afford to any one who takes the trouble to observe his species! What a field for the painter, the physiognomist, and the caricaturist! What faces are to be seen—how rich and broad is their expression when those who own them once get fairly interested in the business of the scene, and become unconscious of all else beside. A countryman's, for instance, when a comic song is sung, or a juggling trick played, how he sits, his head jerked forward like a crane's, as if to get it as near the scene of action as possible, his shoulders up to his ears, his distended mouth dividing his face into two portions, and his eyes as convex as a lobster's; then when the affair reaches the climax, the monstrous twistings and contortions of his visage, and the convulsions of his body rolling to and fro under an uncontrollable VOL. II. 11 storm of laughter, are more amusing than any thing on the boards. Again, where is there a more charming picture than that of a fine girl watching, with intense interest, the escapes or sufferings of the hero or heroine of the piece; her graceful neck inclined forward, her small delicate hand unconsciously grasping the front of the box, her sweet lips slightly parted, and her beaming eyes fixed with tender earnestness on what is passing before them. This the artist may copy, but he cannot go on and pencil down the various shades of sorrow and joy, anxiety and hope, that flit tremulously over her beautiful face. In this world of cold and ceremonious observance it is a treat to see such a girl; she is unsophisticated; and the chances are, that her understanding is better, and her feelings warmer and purer than those who evince more coldness and circumspection. Then there are the coquettes, with their pretty, and the fops with their ridiculous affectation; the solemn gravity of many at a joke, and the merriment of some at a murder; while others are troubled with the most strange and unfortunate peculiarities. There is one individual in the habit of attending the Park, that is afflicted with a hissing Natty Bumpo laugh, which is heard both loudly and distinctly: this places the owner somewhat in the predicament of the fiends in Paradise Lost, who, when desirous of giving applause, found they could only send forth hisses. Whenever any thing very laughable takes place, or an actor plays exceeding well, and the house is in a roar, a loud venomous hiss is heard, and the people all turn indignantly around towards the place from whence the sound proceeds; but the involuntary culprit is never suspected, for he appears, and really is, enjoying himself as much as any of them. But, of all the persons who come to a theatre, the most to be dreaded and avoided are those that are possessed with a talking demon; such as Ophelia characterizes as being “as good as a chorus.” Though a curse to all, they generally bring their particular victim along with them—some simple friend—to whom, during the progress of the play, they detail the whole history of the plot—what has been done in the last scene, and what is to be done in the next—what the several characters have just said, and what they are going to say—remarks on the author—off-hand criticisms on the actors, accompanied with short biographical notices of both, together with a running commentary on different parts of the audience, and their own private opinion on affairs in general—and all this miscellaneous gabble conveyed in that most abhorrent of all sounds, a quick buzzing uninterrupted whisper. Any man who wishes to hear the play, and can sit patiently beside one of those annoyances, has more meekness than Moses, more patience than Job, more forbearance than Socrates, and no nerves at all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A VOYAGE TO EUROPE. Washington Irving crossed the Atlantic, and wrote a beautiful piece thereupon, entitled “The Voyage,” which delighted every one. The natural consequences ensued. All the gentlemen who crossed the Atlantic afterwards, concluded to do as Washington Irving had done, and delight every one likewise, so that in the course of a short time there was no scarcity of marine narratives; and the dwellers in great cities, on both sides, had very particular information afforded them of the perils of such as “went down to the sea in ships” during the summer months. These adventurous men and predestined authors kept a regular diary of the days on which they ate lamb, and the days on which they ate chicken, and the days on which the pecuniary concerns of the captain were benefited by the disorganized state of their system, and they subsisted on rice-water and hope: they severally 11* furnished a description of the ocean in a calm, and a description of the ocean in a storm, for which latter purpose the ocean was afflicted with more storms from May to September than sailors ever heard tell of. They stated, for the first time, that the sea was the “symbol of immensity”—that the water was green on soundings, and “cerulean blue” off; and added their testimony, founded upon actual observation, to the mass of evidence already before the world, that it contained many whales, sharks, porpoises, and other fishes, to which were appended brief touches of natural history as they went along, and invariably a piece of fine writing concerning “sunset on the ocean,” giving an account how that every-day luminary “goes down behind the wilderness of waters.” They moreover let the reader have a minute insight into the state of their feelings, the workings of their bosoms, &amp;c. as they leaned over the ship's side, gazed upon the vasty deep, and thought of the friends and home they had left behind them; and also their vague and very extraordinary speculations concerning the land that lay before them—all which, is it not to be found expanded over an infinite number of pages in the infinite number of “Letters from Europe,” which quietly repose on the back shelves of the establishments of Messrs. Bliss and Carvill, Broadway, and other incautious booksellers? Such being the state of things, it would ill become an humble individual to affect singularity by breaking through an established rule; and the subscriber, therefore, under the impression that it is a debt due to decorum and mankind, proceeds to inform the human race of what he saw and suffered. If I am not as interestingly minute as some of my predecessors, it must be attributed to the unfortunate fact of having lost a valuable “daily journal” overboard, in which the most trivial circumstances were carefully noted down, with appropriate moral reflections attached to each, and the following are therefore merely general recollections thrown together without order or discrimination. In the first place, I hate the sea as much as Satan is said, in catholic countries, to hate holy water; and, notwithstanding all the fine poetry that has been written about it, think it, in every respect, the greatest bore in creation. To me, to be “Once more upon the waters, yet once more,” brings a miserable feeling of lassitude and confinement, rather than of freedom and exultation. It is the most weary, dull, monotonous, unsociable place upon which human beings, with any kindly warmth in their hearts or blood, can sojourn. There is not any thing with which the imprisoned spirit can sympathize. On land, though that land be as sterile and barren as the banks of the river Jordan, or the most unfertile parts about Cape Cod, there is still some inanimate object or other to which the heart can attach itself—a rock, a tree, a bubbling spring, which, after familiarity hath made it pleasant to the eye, we are loth to leave behind and glad to see again. Sterne hath beautifully, and no less beautifully than truly said, that man must love one thing or another, and that for his own part, were he in a desert he would love some cypress; but his affections would be sadly puzzled on what to fix themselves in the watery deserts which separate country from country. The dark waves keep tumbling over and over each other, for ever changing yet still the same, till the fatigued eye turns sickeningly away from this very blue prospect. You even feel sorry for the sullen, noiseless birds that keep eternally wheeling and floating above the curling billows, and regret the doom allotted them figuratively to seek “their bread upon the waters,” or, what is pretty much the same thing to them— their fish. With all their exemption from the murderous sports of man, how unenviable seems their fate, compared with that of the land birds. They have no constant mate expecting them at evening time—no home—no warm nest into which they may creep and fold their weary wings and be at rest; but when the close of day puts an end to their piscatory pursuits, they squat themselves down upon the cheerless waters with but small assurance of being a live bird in the morning, should some shark or other fowl-loving fish pass that way before they are awake and on the wing. Well; there is retribution in the deed—why should not the destroyer be destroyed? they have preyed upon fish, why not fish prey upon them? To all who rave and make poetry about the beauty and delights of a summer sea, I especially recommend the middle of the Atlantic during what is appropriately enough termed “a dead calm”— the ship rolling lazily and heavily from side to side, the sails flapping drowsily against the masts, and a burning, blistering sun sucking the melted pitch and rosin out of the seams of the deck. Of all the suicidal situations in which man can be placed, I think this decidedly the most tempting; and believe, if life could be ended by a wish, few of the unhappy passengers would see the shore again; but fortunately it requires some little energy—some slight exertion to drown yourself, and really you are so very listless—so completely unstrung, that a man cannot be at the trouble of tumbling himself overboard. But then, cries the landsman, what a delightful resource must books be in such a situation. Alas! alas! your mind is as debilitated as your body, and just as incapable of bending its faculties to a salutary purpose. Shakspeare, Milton, Byron, or any thing nervous or exciting, is not to be borne; and about the strongest mental food that the mind can digest in this predicament is a diluted love-story in an “Annual.” I, for one, am very fond of reading, but I could not do it here: I laid myself down on the deck, ate almonds and raisins, and thought of Job. Some people prefer a strom to a calm; but their demerits are so equally balanced, that, like the Frenchman who had to choose between hanging and drowning. I cannot make up my mind to give the preference to either. True, the roaring of the wind, the tearing and splitting of the sails, the violent evolutions of the vessel, and the unique blasphemies which strike the ear from various quarters, with the probability of speedily being among the fishes, tend to arouse the spirit, and stir up, as counsellor Phillips might say, “the green and stagnant waters of the soul;” while the yesty ocean, ever and anon dashing over the ship and wetting you to the skin, is unquestionably sublime; but some how or other I never could relish the sublime much when it interfered materially with my personal comforts; and am unromantic enough to own that I would rather be seated snugly in a decent inn at the foot of a Swiss mountain than identify myself with the icicles at the top of it; so, in a storm I hold it to be a better thing to go below, doff your drenched garments, fix your berth so that you cannot roll an inch either one way or the other, and quietly betake yourself to the arms of Morpheus, rather than stand gaping at the unceremonious ocean, who repays your sincere admiration in a very unhandsome manner by throwing cold water in your face. No—the sea, whether in storm or calm, or enveloped in fog, or in its most favorable state curled with a fresh fair breeze, has few attractions to those who spend more than six hours upon it at a time. Our captain, an old sailor, declared that every day he passed there he considered a blank in his existence. What is there in this be-praised element to give pleasure? In crossing the Atlantic all your amusements are not such as are connected with the sea, but such as serve to draw your attention from it. Chess or drafts, backgammon or cards, are the resources called in to while away the tedious hours; for after you have seen one of mother Carey's chickens, a shoal of porpoises, a shark, and a whale, you have seen about all that is to be seen. At first, like other landsmen, I was very desirous to “see a whale;” but I soon found that, according to the laws of optics, a porpoise alongside of the ship was just as large and as good a sight as a whale half a mile off, which is about as near as they generally venture; while all you mostly see of the rascally sharks is a fin, or the ridge of a brown back peeping above the water. The eye tires of even the finest prospect; but here you are compelled to gaze day after day on water and sky, and all that can be said of the latter is, that it is very blue and that there is a great quantity of it. It may be thought from this that I am no friend or admirer of the sea; but few like it more than I do on the land, the only place, I believe, where people really fall in love with it. Nothing can be finer than to live in a highly cultivated tract of country merely separated from the sea-coast by a high range of sand-hills. The change in the scenery is so instantaneous, and so complete—so very different, yet both so surpassingly beautiful, for few things can excel, in picturesque effect, a bold and animated line of coast. How freshening it is in the summer time, after roaming through orchards, meadows, and cornfields, to cross the barren sand-hills and find yourself on the lone sea-beach, with no human being within sight or hearing. How pleasant to roam to some favorite spot and there lie and watch the clear sparkling tide come rolling in over the smooth sand, forcing its way swiftly up a hundred tiny channels—to dream over again all the wild legends of the mighty element before you— the storm the battle and the wreck, and the hair-breadth escapes of those who have been cast away upon it—to be lulled to slumber by the murmur of the slight waves breaking upon the shore, and making most sweet yet drowsy music in your ear—this is delightful; and I have even enough of the hardi-hood of boyhood to love it in its rougher moods— on a raw and gusty November day, when the seagull comes screaming to the cliffs for shelter, when the wave bursts in thunder at your feet, and the thick fog is whirled from the water like smoke by the tempest—on such a day there is something far from unpleasant in standing on terra firma and watching its manœuvres. Besides, it is such a glorious preparative for a warm, comfortable fire-side and a hearty supper—but from passing any length of time on it in ships, or other smaller vessels called, for unknown reasons, pleasure-boats, VOL. II. 12 heaven preserve me and my posterity, (should I have any.) I have by no means drawn a jaundiced picture, discolored through the agency of disturbed bile, for though occasionally visited by that most horrible of afflictions, sea-sickness, I am better off in that respect than nineteen out of twenty. What must be the state of those wretched individuals who add enduring sickness or continual qualmishness to their other stock of sea comforts, I cannot even venture to conjecture. Persons thoroughly in this state will receive any intimation of the ship's going down with perfect unconcern—they do not set their life at a “pin's fee.” Some Athenian said, when he found the comfortless way in which the Spartans lived, that he no longer wondered at their fearing death so little; and it is only on this principle that I can account for the unnatural tranquillity with which men hear of the chance of running foul of an iceberg, or any other agreeable casualty; while half the peril, when on land quietly enjoying the good things of the world, would perturb their spirits considerably, and cause many retrospective glances towards their past state of existence, and great dubiosity touching their future prospects. Land ho! we have just come in sight of the southern point of Ireland—a few more hours will bring us into the English channel, and the unbounded joy of all on board is the best commentary on the pleasures of the sea. Ah! land, land! we all gaze upon the country of turf and potatoes as wistfully as if it were one of the “islands of the blest;” and the snuffing of the cow in the long boat, as she scents the green herbage afar off, approximates towards the borders of the pathetic. I am circumspect in the choice of my company, and it is consequently seldom that I have any thing to say to the “heavenly nine” or they to me; but on the present occasion I felt something unusual the matter with my brain, and as soon as the evening shades fell, and I could see land no longer, it relieved itself by the following effervescence: LINES ON COMING IN SIGHT OF LAND. “Land, land ahead!” the seamen cries, “Land, land!” re-echoes round: And happy smiles and glistening eyes Repay that joyful sound. The dull and cheerless sea is past— The warm earth meets our view at last, With summer's glories crown'd. Now ill beshrew the twilight gray, That shrouds it from my sight away! Well, let it fade, as fades the light Along the sullen sea; Yet through the watches of the night My thoughts will turn to thee. The fresh green fields—the swelling hills— The music of the gushing rills— The humming of the bee: And scenes and sounds to memory dear, Are in mine eye and in mine ear. The carol of the merry lark Rings through the morning air; The honest sheep dog's wary bark Guarding with watchful care His flocks upon the green hill side: The milkmaid too, with modest pride And pretty anklet bare, Tripping along the dewy green, Is no unpleasant sight, I ween. These, and ten thousand scenes like these, Are passing o'er thy breast. Oh for the wave of thy green trees To shade my noontide rest! The pleasant rustling of the leaves, The warbling of the bird, that weaves Above me its trim nest— While cooling breezes float along Laden with fragrance and with song. And glorious autumn's golden fruits, And summer's lingering flowers, And the sweet woodbine's graceful shoots Twining round rustic bowers; And friends long loved through absent years— And kind eyes sparkling mid their tears, Like April's sun and showers— Await me there. Cease, heart, to swell! Thou salt and bitter sea, farewell!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LONDON THEATRES. Drury-Lane and Covent-garden are two magnificent temples for the representation of the legitimate drama. Taste and elegance are conspicuous in whatever appertains to them; and though both houses are richly ornamented, the most fastidious critic would be puzzled to point out any thing gaudy, glaring, or obtrusive. The contrast between the chaste simplicity of their common scenery, and the glittering coarseness of that of the minor theatres is very striking. The greatest fault of both is their size; great physical powers being absolutely requisite to make the singing and acting effective in the more remote parts of the house. The interior of each being in the shape of a horse-shoe, the stage is consequently much smaller in proportion to the audience-part than that of the Park theatre, which is semicircular. The saloons and lobbies are uncommonly spacious and splendid. The principal saloon 12* at Drury-lane is one large mirror, the walls being entirely covered with glass. Next in reputation to these stands the Haymarket, nearly the size of the Bowery, and bearing about the same relation to Drury-lane and Covent-garden, that the Chatham in its best days did to the Park. The English Opera-house—lately burned and now rebuilding—its name sufficiently indicates the purposes to which it is appropriated. The Italian Opera-house is not yet open for the season, but is, I understand, by far the largest and most splendid theatrical establishment in London. Then there is Astley's in the quadruped line, where dramas written by asses are played by horses—where the business of the scene is transacted en croupe, and ladies are courted and tyrants are slaughtered at a three-quarter pace or a full gallop. Sadler's Wells, once famous for heroic actions and real water, swearing and tobacco. Here ships were nightly wrecked and long-boats overturned; and sailors continually employed in jumping over-board to save beauty and innocence, in wet white garments from a watery grave. The performers were a species of amphibious animals, and passed half their time in fluids; and the best swimmer was, next to a Newfoundland dog, the most important personage in the establishment. Here it was that the “Courageous Coral Diver, or the Shark of the Gulph of California,” had such a successful run. The “Humane Society for the recovery of drowned persons” allowed, I believe, their drag-nets, warm flannels, stomach-pumps, and other apparatus to be kept in readiness at this theatre, in case of accident; but still they could not prevent the coughs, colds, catarrhs, and pulmonary complaints incident to such an otter-like state of existence—the real water was therefore discontinued—the sea was sunk, and the ocean is now made of carpets and painted sail-cloth, as in other establishments. Besides these, there is an infinite number of minor theatres, with the names of half of which I am unacquainted. Some of the major-minors are highly respectable, and not unfrequently have first-rate talent on their boards; but the minor-minors are, from stage to gallery, an unmixed mass of ignorance and vulgarity. Here is performed that species of “national drama,” which was wont to be enacted at the Lafayette and Mount Pitt circus before they were purified by fire; and which is still to be seen at the Park and Bowery, much to their credit, on holiday nights, where the several parties have it all their own way; and the most glorious and decisive victories are obtained by the tremendous carnage of one half of the supernumeraries, and the craven cowardice of the other; and where the enemies of valiant Englishmen and courageous Americans are humbled into the dust before them, much to the credit of the very patriotic and enlightened audiences. Here, as on your side of the water, instances of almost incredible prowess are as common as can be; and an enemy's first-rate is frequently boarded and taken by a single midshipman, or a young officer alone cuts a whole detachment to pieces, except that the curtain falls amid shouts of “England for ever!” instead of “Hurrah for Jackson!” I had been so long accustomed to hear all the love and liberty and heroism and bombast proceed out of the mouths of gentlemen in blue jackets, that it at first seemed strange to hear gentlemen in red declaiming in precisely the self-same strain. However, it must be said for the Londoners, that these direct national puffs are not tolerated at decent theatres. The victories of his majesty's forces are almost entirely confined to places patronized for the most part by butcher's boys, dustmen, draymen, and coal-heavers. The principal source of profit, however, to nearly all the minor theatres, is the “supernatural business,” or representation of demoniacal dramas. But here no narrow national feelings prevail—justice is equally dealt out to all; and in the last scene the devil has his due, let the culprit be what countryman he may. The mythologies of all ages and nations have been raked up, and the evil spirits with which they abound re-produced upon the stage. It is really fearful to look upon a dead wall, covered with play-bills, and read the dreadful announcements for the evening's amusements, rendered terribly distinct by ominous red and sombre black type of gigantic stature. Some of the managers ground their claims to public patronage and support on the immense expense they have been at in order to do justice to the views of the interior of the infernal regions; and one spirited lessee has actually constructed a false or double stage, which, at the termination of the piece, sinks down with the particular fiend and victim of the evening, amid cataracts of flame spouting forth from the side-wings. The enacting of demons has become a regular branch of theatrical business; and Mr. O. Smith, a man with an unamiable countenance, and a voice horrifically hoarse, is as distinguished in this line as Kean in tragedy, or Liston in comedy. “The prince of darkness is a gentleman,” says Shakspeare, but two-thirds of his representatives in London make him out little better than an illiterate scoundrel. It is rather too bad on the most serious occasions, to hear the father of all evil transposing his v's and w's, and leaving out his h's, in the true cockney style, unable even to pronounce his own proper place of residence in a correct manner. The public appetite for gloomy horrors is at present perfectly ravenous. I know not how to account for this, except by attributing it to the alarming increase in the consumption of pork which has taken place in the metropolis within these few years. This species of animal nutriment is the favorite food of the lower orders, and I am inclined to think, generates more diabolical tastes and propensities than “flesh of muttons, beeves, or goats.” How is it possible that a person who banquets off pork sausages and heavy porter, and then swallows two or three drams of spirits of turpentine, miscalled gin, can have his sensibilities aroused by such slight provocations as wit and humor? Is he a man to be tickled with a straw? What is a joke or a scrap of sentiment, or a lively conceit to him? You might as well give a glass of delicately flavored wine to an habitual bibber of fourth-proof brandy. Take him to see “Much ado about nothing,” and he thinks the play well named—or “As you like it,” and he likes it not. No—he pays his money and goes to witness “The Infernal Compact; or, the Fiend, the Victim, and the Murderer!”—he puts his hands in his pockets, and criticizes the vagaries of Mr. Smith, in his favorite character of the “Demon of the Valley of Skulls,” (as performed by him fifty-seven successive nights, with distinguished approbation!) These monstrosities have been of gradual growth. First came “Cherries and Fair Stars,” “Visions of the Sun,” and similar tales of enchantment; but these were soon found to be mere moonshine, and a class of melo-dramas was got up where “murders were done too terrible for the ear.” The Newgate calendar was regularly dramatized, and a most atrocious state of things prevailed for some time; but, as the anti-temperance man goes on regularly to increase the strength of the dose, as his acuteness of taste decreases, so the managers, after blunting the feelings and perceptions of the public, were obliged to resort to still stronger stimulants, and hence the present sulphureous state of the stage. But even this is beginning to fail. Notwithstanding the “infernal abysses,” by the help of chemical substances, which throw on the stage a strong glare of red, blue, or yellow light, are rendered, as the term is, “highly effective,” insomuch, indeed, as to produce a strong impression on any person unused to such exhibitions, the cockney surveys the whole with critical coolness, until a superabundant quantity of flame elicits some such exclamation of admiration as—“I say, Bill, vot do you think of that 'ere? My eyes!” delivered in a tone of voice which evidently shows that the view of the place of punishment before him has not made any impression on the mind of the speaker in regard to his own ulterior prospects. If the stage at present actually shows “the very age and body of the time, its form and pressure,” the millenium is much further off than many people suppose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EDITORIAL COURTESIES. “I must speak in a passion, and I will do it in King Cymbyses' vein.” —Shakspeare. If Socrates, or any other sensible ancient, could be resuscitated, and have half-a-dozen flaming rhapsodies on the benefits and blessings of the “press,” put into his hands, what a glorious and mighty change would he suppose had taken place in the ordering of public affairs, since the time when the Athenian rabble were led by the nose by every noisy demagogue who chose to spout nonsense to them in their market-places. How the good man's heart would be filled with rejoicing as he read glowing descriptions of the tremendous capabilities of this mighty engine, wielded solely for the benefit of mankind, and of its unwearied exertions to disseminate useful information and correct knowledge of political events to the meanest citizen of the state! He would suppose, that with this almost VOL. II. 13 omnipotent power arrayed on the side of virtue, and watching with untiring vigilance over the true interests of all, that this wicked world must have been transformed into a sort of Utopia since his time—a place from which all prejudice, venality, corruption, and sycophancy were swept away, and where the governors and the governed would emulate each other in their exertions for the common weal. But if, after perusing the aforesaid rhapsodies, the said Socrates could have a quantity of newspapers taken indiscriminately from different parts of the country placed before him, there is strong reason to believe that an attentive perusal of their elegant contents would materially change his opinion. He would find the gentlemen presiding over one half of the press stating that the other portion of their editorial brethren were, without exception, the greatest set of rascals, scoundrels, rogues, thieves, and vagabonds that ever existed on the face of the earth; and that they were the most vile, the most degraded, the most contemptible miscreants that could, by any possibility, disgrace humanity. On the other hand, he would find the party accused in these gentle terms, asserting that their assailants were well known to be such infamous liars, so totally destitute of every spark of honesty, so stained with infamy, so branded with convicted falsehoods, as to render any thing they might say unworthy of the slightest notice. Poor Socrates would be sadly puzzled, and think there was more in this than he ever “dreamt of in his philosophy,” and that truth still kept her ancient station at the bottom of a well. He would find these virtuous vehicles of knowledge and information made up of quack advertisements, dreadful murders, dreadful poetry, Joe-Miller jests, and editorial personalities; in the latter of which he would see all the coarseness of his old enemy Aristophanes ten times trebled, without a single redeeming sprinkling of his wit and humor; and he would be lost in utter amazement to find that the very worst and most ignorant portion of the people (according to their own showing) had been, by some strange fatality, elevated to instruct and amuse the rest. There are some subjects which it is necessary to aid by a slight stretch of the fancy, or a little exaggeration of language, in order to give them point and effect; but to describe, just as it is, the manner in which editorial warfare is carried on in the country papers of the United States, other words than are to be found in Walker or Webster must be sought for; they are too tame, too weak to convey any idea of these Billingsgate personalities. —“A beggar in his drink, Would not bestow such terms upon his callet,” as the worthy conductors of the press think proper to bestow upon each other. Wherein the utility— the advantage of all this to the public, or what is more, to themselves, consists, it is not easy to discover. If they are what they say they are, would it not be their policy to agree and keep it concealed, and not blazon forth each other's infamy to the world? And what has that world to do with their disreputable quarrels and low abuse, farther than to laugh at and despise them for it? the public of this day, as of yore, —“care not a toss up Whether Mossop kick Barry or Barry kick Mossop;” and after looking on for some time, and amusing itself with the noise and sputter of the enraged belligerents, come to the conclusion that they are both contemptible creatures, and pay no further attention to the matter. In fact, nine-tenths of the papers have, by this degrading conduct, in a great measure lost the power of affecting character either by praise or censure: there are many who pay no sort of attention either to what they say of public men or of each other; and if there are still those who, making a deduction of ninety-nine per cent., think “there must be some truth in what the fellow says,” their number is fast diminishing. A paper is at present lying before us, from which better things might have been expected, as it is published in a decent neighborhood, and contains some good reading matter, in which, amid two-thirds of a column of abuse, one of the most moderate sentences is, that his opponent is “a liar by nature and a thief by profession.” After going on for some time with unabated spirit in this strain of unmitigated abuse, he winds up with the following magnificent piece of composition. “If the river Amazon were made to run through his (his opponent's) soul, more time would be taken up in cleansing it of its depravity and filthiness, than was required by the ancient river to cleanse the celebrated stables, wherein a thousand oxen had been stalled for almost as many years!” This appears to be only one of a series of articles on the subject! and the offence, as far as we can make it out, for which all these hard words are let loose, seems to have been the copying a paragraph without due credit, or something of the kind of equally vital importance to the community. We have not seen the replication to this choice morceau, but presume it will be in the same style of impassioned and elegant invective. Now is not this and such as this abominable? 13* and hundreds of instances could be pointed out of still greater magnitude, in which the personal appearance and family connexions of a man are ridiculed—charges of not having paid his tailor's bill, or any thing else, no matter what, that depravity can invent or blackguardism utter, are put forth. Opprobrious epithets from such sources, when applied to those who have been long before the public, and whose characters are well and favorably known, can do but comparatively little harm; they may exclaim with Brutus, “I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I regard not;” but suppose an honorable and sensitive man, just commencing his career, attacked by one of those literary scavengers, what exquisite pain must it give him to find himself dragged forward and slandered in this manner. And he has no redress; he cannot reply, or at all events if he does, it will be a most unequal match, for he will be temperate in his language, and anxious not to assert any thing but what is strictly true. It would be like a gentleman neatly dressed in light-colored unmentionables and white kid gloves, engaged in a combat of throwing mud from a kennel with a ragged and tattered miscreant; his adversary, from being well practised at the game, throws ten handsfull of dirt for his one, and quickly bespatters him all over, while the few additional pieces that he could send, would never be discerned on his opponent's already soiled and filthy garments. The best way certainly for those who are well enough known to afford it, is to pass all such attacks over in absolute silence. Blackwood's Magazine, whose personality has at least always prostituted humor and ability to make it go off, has never been so enraged by any of the retorts of its adversaries as by the real or affected contempt of the Edinburgh Review. Notwithstanding the virulent abuse that has from time to time been bestowed upon it, the Edinburgh has never, since the commencement of Blackwood, let it appear that it was conscious there was such a journal in existence. We are not very sanguine in anticipations of any speedy and effectual change for the better in this world of ours; but we do think the time is fast coming when, with a few exceptions, this custom of the present race of public journals in the United States will be regarded with unqualified contempt. There are already symptoms of better things. Most of the city papers in New-York, and indeed in all large towns, have lately amended their ways considerably in this respect, though they were never one quarter so bad as their rural brethren; and there are several journals that are respectable and entertaining repositories of news, knowledge, literature, and fashion, while their trifling disputes are conducted in a pleasant and gentlemanly spirit. Clashing interests and party views will always preserve some portion of personality in the world; but it would be more agreeable to all concerned to settle their little affairs of the pen by good-natured raillery, light repartees, and polished sarcasms, such as pass in decent society, in preference to vulgar slang and porter-house figures of rhetoric. Let such contests be carried on like two gentlemen engaged in a bout at foils, in which both exert their utmost skill and ingenuity, in a friendly temper; and when a “palpable hit” is given on either side, let it be courteously acknowledged, and then try it again; and not like a couple of ragamuffins in the street, who fight and tear themselves to pieces for the amusement of the spectators.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MR. LISTON. “Curse that incorrigible face of yours; though you never suffer a smile to mantle it, yet it is a figure of fun for all the rest of the world.” Of all the actors I have ever seen, Kean and Liston appear to me to be the greatest, and to have the least in common with others of their species. Of the two, perhaps Liston is the most original. He is the Hogarth of actors; and like that great painter, has been more highly than justly appreciated. Not that either have been too highly thought of—“I hold the thing to be impossible”—but the broad, rich humor, which is the distinguishing characteristic of both, has, from its prominence, thrown their minor good properties onto the shade. Hogarth, to the qualities peculiarly his own, added the rare merit of being a chaste and skilful colorist, (the most difficult thing to be attained in painting, considering it purely as an art,) and was, moreover— however generally such an opinion may be entertained—not the least of a carcaturist. Neither is Liston, notwithstanding it pleases certain pragmatical persons, who, I humbly apprehend, know nothing about the matter, to assert the contrary. There are now, as in the days of William Shakspeare, those who discountenance all cachinnatory movements as unbecoming; regarding gravity as the only outward and visible type of that great inward accumulation of wisdom, which generally lies too deep to be ever discovered. These people think because Mr. Liston occasionally plays coarse and foolish parts in coarse and foolish farces, that Mr. Liston is, consequently, a coarse and foolish fellow, and only fit to amuse the uneducated vulgar; and as “grimace” and “buffoonery” are the two standing words used in abusing comedians, let their faults be what they may, they have not unfrequently been applied to Liston. Now if any one be free from what is meant by these two words, as set down in many dictionaries, it is this actor. The merits of his unparalleled countenance are passive, not active; and distortion would only render that countenance common-place, which in a state of blank repose, is intensely ridiculous. The great merit of Liston is his earnestness. Kean does not appear more earnest in Othello than does Liston at the loss of a pocket-handkerchief, or being overcharged a shilling in a tavern-bill. His whole soul seems to be absorbed in an affair of this kind. He does not bustle about or put himself in a passion in order to make the audience laugh at the ridiculous nature of the circumstances, as other actors do; but all the faculties of the man's mind seem concentrated to endeavor to convince or persuade, as the case may require, solely to save the said shilling, or regain the said handkerchief; and it is the contrast between the disproportion of the exercise employed and the importance of the object to be attained—like the wars of the Lilliputians and the Blefuscudians—that is so supremely ridiculous. Fools may say that this is merely admirable foolery —it is a great deal more. It is a shrewd satire upon humanity, turning into burlesque the lofty pretensions—the power and knowledge and wit and wisdom of mankind, and presents a stronger and truer picture of the littleness of man and his pursuits than a thousand homilies. Even Heraclitus, could he look at Liston, would laugh to see the “noble reason” and “infinite faculties” of one of the “paragon of animals” utterly prostrated by the loss of an inside place in a stage-coach; and he would indeed exclaim with the poet, though in a very different sense, “what a piece of work is man!” I think I never saw or read a more forcible exemplification of the importance a man's feelings and actions are to himself, and the less than the shadow of a shade they are to the rest of the world, than is to be witnessed in a farce where Liston alights from a coach top, and is followed on to the stage by the driver for the customary gratuity. Those who have traveled in England may have remarked the manner in which the coachmen receive what the traveler may be pleased to give them. While he is getting the money from his pocket Jehu is all attention; but the moment he has received it, his business is over—he turns upon his heel, and all traces of the giver pass from his mind for ever. Liston detains the coachman, (and you can see in his countenance the vital importance he attaches to what he is about,) in order to draw the distinction and durably impress it upon his mind that his (Liston's) giving him a sixpence was by no means a compulsory measure, but a pure and spontaneous emanation of generosity, or, to use his own phraseology, “hentirely hoptional.” A person standing on the brink of a running stream on a cold day, seriously employed in “writing his name in water,” would be accounted insane—the attempt to write munificence and generosity on the coachman's mind, is equally futile; yet how many in the world make these and similar efforts who are not accounted crazy, and whose last will and testament stands good in law. There has been much said about the ugliness of Liston's physiognomy. I do not think it such as can be fairly termed ugly; yet it is a face that a sensitive sculptor would faint to look upon—a large mass of inanimate flesh, with only an every-day mouth, a most insignificant nose, both as to size and shape, and a pair of lack-lustre eyes to diversify the blank and extensive prospect, but the word “ugly” gives no more definite idea of it than the word “beauty.” It is a paradoxical face, most expressive in expressing the absence of all expression; yet at times combining the expression of the most inveterate stupidity with concentrated conceit and supreme self-satisfaction, in a way that has never been equalled. There are many who, by the common play of the muscles or contortion of the features, can counterfeit stupidity and conceit, in a greater or less degree, at separate times; but not one who, like Liston, can at the same time make you feel perfectly assured not only that the personage he is representing has not an idea, but also, that all attempts to make him sensible of that fact, or to inoculate him with one, would be altogether hopeless. His voice is as unique as his face; and the deep sepulchral croak, in which he narrates VOL. II. petty grievances, leaves you no choice whether to laugh or let it alone. There is a farce, entitled “Comfortable Lodgings,” in which he enacts the part of a rich and hypochondriacal Englishman, traveling to get clear of an unaccountable melancholy, and to learn to enjoy himself like other people, and describes one of his peculiarities with good effect. In answer to his servant's inquiry of “Lord, sir, why can't you laugh, and do as other people do?” “Laugh!” he exclaims in a tone from the bottom of his chest, and with the bitter emphasis of a misanthrope—“laugh! I cannot laugh! I cannot do as other people do! When I look around me (looking at the pit with a dull stare) I see every one laughing and merry, (a fact,) while my face remains as immoveable as a face carved on a brass knocker!” “Do as other people do?” he continues—“I can't do as other people do. Even in the packet-boat, when all the passengers were as passengers who had never been at sea before usually are, I tried to be like them! but I could not! I looked on a disappointed man!” Incomparable Liston! Thou hast been a benefit and a luxury unto the melancholy inhabitants of this great city for many a day! Thou hast refuted the trite axiom that “money will not purchase pleasure;” for what man in London town, for the last twenty years, who could put his hand into his breeches pocket, and find therein three shillings and sixpence, but could say unto himself, “Liston plays—I will hie me unto the theatre and forget my cares—lo! I will laugh!” And if laughing promoteth (as physicians affirm) the healthy action of the biliary organs, from what floods of acrimony and ill-will hast thou cleared the livers of men! Even exquisites, as they looked at thee, have been awakened from their state of graceful torpor, and the corset laces of fair ladies have been cracked in twain. Thou hast pleased alike the well-judging, the ill-judging, and those who take not the trouble of judging at all. As the Persian saith—“may thy shadow never be less!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FANNY KEMBLE. The rising hope and promise of the drama—the bud—the blossom—the half-blown “rose and expectancy” of the theatrical world—the pledge to the rising generation, that, in their time, at least, Juliet shall not lie buried in the tomb of the Capulets, or Belvidera's sorrows be entrusted entirely to regularly broken-in, thorough-paced, tragedy hacks. I am well nigh tired of the mechanical woes and shallow agonies of every-day tragedy—of picturesque and passionless attitudinizing—of storms of grief, according to the stage directions—“cross to R. H. and burst into tears;” of violent beating of the cold and insensible breast, and knocking of the clenched hand upon the empty head. I am tired of the mere pantomime of the art, without feeling or common sense—tired of vehemence and impetuosity, instead of passion; and particularly tired of hearing such easy work characterized as the “flashes and outbreakings of genius.” To me, gross and habitual exaggeration seems to pervade nearly all the tragic exhibitions on the stage; and if this be so, it is sufficient evidence of the absence of feeling. Genuine feeling never exaggerates. Those who are really touched by the parts they assume, may, from that very cause, be so little master of themselves as to fail in giving a finished portrait of the character they have undertaken to represent; but they never, by any chance, fall into the opposite fault of “o'erstepping the modesty of nature,” and becoming more violent than the hero or heroine of the scene would have been in reality. There is generally, however, an instinctive propriety about true passion, which leads those under its influence to do neither more nor less than they ought to do; whilst the less easily excited feelings of others wait upon the judgment, and it becomes a matter of calculation how much grief or energy must be used on certain occasions. But it is invariably your hacknied, cold-blooded actors, without either passion or judgment, and who off the stage laugh at any thing like enthusiasm in their art as ridiculous, that “out-herod Herod,” and affect a superabundance of feeling to conceal their utter want of it; just as ladies of questionable character make an over parade of delicacy; or, indeed, as pretension 14* of any and every sort seeks to conceal the absence of what it has not by an ostentatious display of the semblance of the quality it would be thought to possess. Now Miss Kemble does not exaggerate. I have watched her closely, and have never, according to my notions of things, seen, either in look, voice, or action, the slightest attempt to impose upon the audience by extravagance—to extract, as it were, their sympathies by force, and storm them into approval. She is not yet, in some respects, so “effective” an actress as others of infinitely less ability— that is, she does not so well understand how to produce a sensation by “points” and “situations.” She has yet much to learn and something to unlearn; but she has that within her which cannot be taught, though, parrot-like, it may be imitated—genuine passion, delicacy, and feeling! and all that is necessary for her to do to become a great actress is, in acquiring the necessary business and technicalities of the stage, to preserve pure and undefiled those rare qualities. This is no easy task. Acting is an art in which the noblest results have to be effected by the most unromantic means. Bombastes Furioso itself is not so much of a burlesque as the rehearsal of a tragedy. To say nothing of Macbeths and Othellos in surtout coats and pepper-and-salt pantaloons, and Lady Macbeths and Desdemonas in fitch tippets and Leghorn flats, the continual recurrence of trivial directions in the midst of agonizing speeches —“when I do so, mind you do so”—the familiar and unseasonable colloquialisms, the everlasting appeals to and from the stage manager, the scoldings and the squabblings, are apt to fritter away all enthusiasm in people of ordinary minds, until they become a kind of speaking and attitudinizing machines—mere actors and actresses, who occasionally produce an effect by the beauty of the language they deliver, or from the situations in which they are placed; but who are, for the most part, incapable of duly appreciating either the one or the other. It is only those whose feelings lie too deep beneath the surface to be ruffled or worn away by the habits and jargon of their profession, and who, when the curtain rises, step upon the stage creatures of another element, that really become great actors. There are plenty of anecdotes of Kean afloat, weighty enough of themselves to apparently controvert this assertion; but however that wonderful creature may now have become hardened by habit, he must have been at one time terribly in earnest, and the effect which he still creates is produced by a faithful recollection and copy of the feelings which originally agitated him. It is to be hoped that Miss Kemble will become a great actress, and that the artificial education, of which she has yet much to receive, will not destroy the natural beauty and freshness of her mind. At present her personations are rather distinguished by feminine sweetness and delicacy, and quick and violent transitions of passion, than by sustained force and grandeur; but there is something occasionally in the tone of her voice—in her dark expressive eye and fine forehead, that speaks of the future Queen Katherine and wife of Macbeth. Her Juliet, with some faults, is a delightful, affectionate, warm-hearted piece of acting; and she is decidedly the least mawkish and most truly loving and loveable Belvidera I have ever seen. The closing scene of madness, where others fail, is her greatest triumph. The tones of her voice, when playfully threatening Jaffier, might almost touch the heart of a money-scrivener. She is the only Belvidera I have beheld play this scene twice. They all contrive to make it either excessively repulsive or ridiculous, and somehow or other manage to bring to mind a very vivid picture of Tilburina in the Critic; while their invariably going home in the midst of their distresses, and after a partial touch of insanity, to put off their black velvets and put on their white muslins to go completely mad in, because, as that lady says, “it is a rule,” by no means tends to do away with this unfortunate association of ideas. Miss Kemble is at present the sole hope of the English public in tragedy. She must not disappoint them, for, if she does, there is no one else on whom they can turn their eyes. But when it is considered that this is only her second season —that she is yet but a girl of eighteen or nineteen, it may be fairly said that she has already done sufficient to justify the most sanguine expectations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MADAME VESTRIS. Arch, easy, impudent, pert, sprightly, and agreeable, with a handsome face, a delicious person, a rich, musical voice, and an inexhaustible fund of self-possession, this vivacious lady has pleased, and continues to please on every stage, and in every department of the drama in which she appears. She suits all tastes. It is impossible for any one to dislike her; and just as impossible, I should think, for any to become enthusiastically fond of her acting. There is no depth, nor power, nor sensibility about her. Neither is there the aping or affectation of these things. She is, emphatically, a clever actress, which stands in about the same relation to a great actress as an epigrammatist to a poet; or a shrewd, worldly man to a wise one; and her being a more universal favorite than others of a higher order of merit, is only another proof of what has been proved some thousand times since the world began—that success is a very fallacious test of ability, for the simple reason, that the more the kind of merit is upon a level with the intellects of the majority of the judges, the more likely it is to be appreciated. The lady's talent is purely executional, and has nothing to do with the higher province of conception—indeed the characters in which she generally appears are not conceptions but copies, or copies of copies of the ephemeral whims and vagaries of the passing hour —trifling and agreeable, and well suited to the prevailing light and superficial taste in theatrical matters; for, without cant, it is light and superficial. I have been told that she plays Rosalind. I should like to see her do so for curiosity's sake; for I cannot imagine a more pleasant and amusing performance, and at the same time more decidedly different from what it ought to be, than Madame Vestris's Rosalind. She will be the arch, lively, free-spoken, well-bred lady of the French court to the life; but any thing rather than the wild, daring, susceptible, romantic Rosalind. Two-thirds of Madame Vestris's notoriety has arisen from the facility with which she can un-sex herself, and the confident boldness with which she makes her bow to the audience in breeches. It is all very well that she does so—half measures are very perplexing and disagreeable; and if a lady makes up her mind to wear this article of apparel, either in public or private, the more decidedly and gracefully she does it the better; but still there must be some affectation in the raptures of the town at witnessing the same. To be sure, no one buttons a coat, adjusts a cravat, wears a hat, handles a cane, or draws a pair of gloves on in the true spirit of knowing and irresistible coxcombry equal to Madame Vestris; and it is really pleasant to sit and see those manly airs and graces played of by a woman, affording, as it does, conclusive evidence that such deep-laid schemes to ensnare the admiration of the fair sex do not always escape detection; yet still the skill and observation requisite to do this may be rated too highly. But Madame Vestris has better, though perhaps weaker claims than this, on the public favor. She has the ability to make wearisome common-place passable, frivolity agreeable, and sprightliness fascinating—a never-flagging joyousness of spirit, and an almost promethean power of imparting a portion of her exuberance of life and animation to the walking, talking, mechanical blocks by which she is occasionally surrounded. To use a striking, technical phrase, she “keeps the stage alive.” Her motions are graceful in the extreme, and like a greyhound or a thorough-bred racer, she cannot put herself in an awkward attitude. Her chambermaids have an archness inexpressible; and, if it be a merit, (a stage one it certainly is,) no one equals her in a certain quiet and unutterable mode of giving a double entendre. As a singer, Madame Vestris is deservedly admired. There is a hearty, sensible, straight-forwardness in her manner, and an absence of quackery and pretension in her style that is extremely agreeable. She is a good enough tactician to know exactly what she can do, and though a spoiled favorite, discreet enough seldom to attempt more than she can, with credit and safety go through with—a rare merit. Her voice is none of your common, thin, clear, unsubstantial organs, but of a full, round, rich, satisfying quality; her manner of giving the arch, and what may be called dashing songs, she is in the habit of singing, is charming, and the effect of the whole—voice, look, and action—delightful. There is another particular in which Vestris is unrivalled, though, from the extraordinary notions of delicacy prevalent in the western hemisphere, wherein you are located, I almost despair of making myself understood. I mean as regards the symetry of those portions of the human frame which are situated between the knees and ankles, but which it is the custom of the country never to name by VOL. II. 15 the right name, except when attached to the bodies of inferior animals, such as dogs and horses; though wherein consists the harm, even when speaking of a lady, of plainly using the monosyllable beginning with an l and ending with a g, with an intermediate vowel, I cannot say, but leave it to people much better acquainted with delicacy and metaphysics, than I pretend to be, to determine. But this I can say, that after having repeatedly looked upon those two unmentionable pieces of humanity belonging to Madame Vestris in the most critical manner, I think them, as far as my judgment goes, perfect in every point. Madame Vestris is also highly accomplished in other matters, being mistress of both French and Italian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PASTA, TAGLIONI, ETC. Who has not heard of Pasta? The “glorious Pasta” —the “divine Pasta”—the “immortal Pasta”—the Pasta whose fame has reached every part of Europe where a musician lives or an opera-house exists; and who, despite of professional rivalries and jealousies, is allowed by universal acclamation—by competent and incompetent judges—to have “touched the topmost point of greatness” in her profession? After an absence of three years from England, she made her appearance at the King's theatre, upon which occasion nearly all the beauty and fashion of the metropolis assembled to welcome her return; together with a few individuals, like your humble servant, neither particularly beautiful nor fashionable. I cannot say but that I attended rather to appease my feelings of awakened curiosity than from any sanguine anticipations of pleasure, because I thought that my ignorance of the Italian language would be a drawback, not to be counterbalanced by the talents of the actress, or a bald English translation of the opera; but, without any affectation, I can safely say I came away as much gratified as astonished, and as much astonished as a person of an equable temperament can well be. Pasta is certainly sui generis. There have been many good actors and many good singers, but such an union of musical excellence and Siddonian power, passion, grace, and majesty does not, never did, and it may be, never will exist again in the same person. She stands alone: no comparison between her and any other will hold good—though not so much on the score of inferiority as dissimilarity. The piece selected for her debut was Mayer's grand serious opera of Medea, a part with which Madame Pasta has become identified, and of which she holds undisputed possession. All who have the slightest smattering of classicality are familiar with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece: his desertion of his lawful spouse Medea, his subsequent bigamious conduct in espousing the Princess Creusa, and the fearful retaliation of his ex-wife. The dramatist has followed the old story or fable very closely; and the predominating passions are consequently love, jealousy, rage, and revenge, with a suitable climax of horror. I have seen many fine performances, but I never saw one in which the actor appeared more terrifically in earnest than in this instance. She was a complete whirlwind of the passions: a southern vehemence pervaded every look and gesture; yet, for all that, there was not any thing in her acting in the slightest degree overstrained or artificial, or which the most phlegmatic spectator could point out as not justified by her situation in the scene. In the first act, when endeavoring to prevent Jason's marriage, she is merely a sublime termagant; and it is only in the second, after all her efforts prove fruitless, and she resolves upon revenge, that her real triumph commences. Certainly nothing could be finer or more touching than the irresolution with which she regards her children when meditating their murder—her alternate fierceness and tenderness—her unavailing wish that she could only kill the father's part in them—the deadly hatred with which she regards them as Jason's offspring, and the love and pity into which she relapses as she feels that they are likewise her own. Despair was never more truly or beautifully personified, than, when about to strike the fatal blow, she suddenly feels a mother's fondness tugging at her heart-strings—her uplifted arm falls powerless by her side, her head sinks upon her bosom, and she stands a few seconds as in a trance—helpless 15* and desolate. The voice of Jason, heard in pursuit of her, rouses and lashes her into fury, bordering on insanity, and the unnatural murder is at length consummated. I have somewhat of an Indian contempt for gesticulation on ordinary occasions, holding it to be Frenchified, frivolous, and ridiculous; and all kinds of attitudinizing are my especial abhorrence. If ever I be executed for murder, it will be for discharging a pistol from the pit of the theatre at some fellow who, at the sight of a ghost or an injured friend, has thrown his legs and arms into what he conceives a beautiful position, and loth to give the audience too little of a good thing, continues them in it, until the applause his evolution has excited subsides, to the entire destruction of the illusion of the scene. But action, when there is heart and soul in it, and when every movement is apparently the result of the feeling of the moment, is an universal language; and it is extraordinary what a sensation may at times be produced by the sweeping of an arm or the pointing of a finger. Pasta is continually in motion. I do not know whether she wants repose in other parts—in Medea the violence of the passions called into play will not admit of it—but there is a grace, variety, and fiery vehemence in her gestures and manner, the very opposite of theatrical calculation and display. Some of her attitudes are the very essence of the “sublime and beautiful.” She appears to have something else to think about than how the extremities of her person are conducting themselves. The closing scene, when, after the murder of her children, she confronts Janson, throws the dagger reeking with their blood towards him, exclaiming, as he turns away with horror, “Ha! traitor—dost thou shun me?” is perfectly appalling. Of Pasta's astonishing voice it may be said that its claims to pre-eminence rest rather upon its enormous power than its quality—not that it is deficient in the latter respect, but the former is its distinguishing characteristic; the manner in which it fills and rings through the immense opera-house is wonderful. It is, in the lower tones, what is termed a “veiled” voice— that is, in plain English, rather husky; but this, which to others would be a serious disadvantage, is, on many occasions, of signal service to Pasta, particularly in depicting the stronger passions, such as despair or horror; the upper tones are remarkably full and clear, and all that can be desired. Upon the whole, she is one of the wonders of the age, whose merits have not been overrated; and, if ever she cross the Atlantic, I am not afraid that what I have ventured to say in her behalf, will appear at all exaggerated. London is certainly a pleasant place in many respects—you can have the very best of every thing if you desire it, and merely for paying extravagantly for it. As soon as the first singer in the world, in her line, had withdrawn her claims to public attention for the evening, the first dancer in the world, to wit, Taglioni, put in hers. Do not be afraid! My enthusiasm about her was only transitory, and I am not going to be eloquent or tedious (as the discriminating or foolish reader may think me) in her praise to any alarming extent. Besides, there is nothing astonishing about Taglioni—at least according to the common acceptation of the word—nothing to gape and wonder at; and in any of the minor theatres in London, or elsewhere, I have no doubt she would be accounted immensely inferior to Mademoiselles Celeste, Constance, Heloise, and other spinners around on one leg, who unblushingly call themselves dancers. Her style is rather distinguished by ease, grace, and elegance, than energy and spirit. She has not the fire or nimbleness of Ronzi Vestris, but her manner is more refined; and she has less of the trickery of the art than even that polished danseuse. Perhaps there are as many points of resemblance between Taglioni and Mrs. Austin as can possibly exist between two accomplished mistresses of such widely different arts. (Every thing now-a-days, dancing, tailoring, and cookery comes under the comprehensive head of “arts and sciences.”) Both exhibit the same heedlessness of mere effect, and appear to have about an equal contempt for what the French term a tour de force. A degree of languor, almost amounting to indifference, seems to pervade both, and both achieve the most difficult triumphs in their art with so little effort that the uninitiated spectator remains almost unconscious that any thing uncommon has been accomplished. Both, in short, belong to that scarce and valuable class of public characters who seek rather to delight than astonish—who appeal rather to the good sense and good taste of the few than the “ignorant wonder” of the many.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PLACIDE. Doubtless three as good actors as Hilson, Barnes, and Placide, are to be found; but it would be extremely difficult to get three together with qualities so finely balanced—so excellent, yet so dissimilar, that in whatever requisites one is comparatively poor, another is proportionably rich—three who will play with equal spirit and effect in the same piece, and appear as frequently together without jostling each other. There is something pleasing, and to those who know any thing of the everlasting feuds and jealousies of a green-room, something astonishing in the uninterrupted harmony with which, season after season, these gentlemen, “labor in their vocation.” They are a worthy triumvirate—three public benefactors, to whom the citizens ought to be grateful; for their talents have often given them pleasure in exchange for care; and many a merry hour and joyous laugh has been the result of their exertions. Four or five years ago, Placide's abilities were but little known. He had risen from the lowest walks of the drama, and, as is common in such cases, the admiration of the audience did not keep pace with his increasing merit. They were slow to believe that one whom they had long been in the habit of regarding as not above mediocrity, could ever attain excellence, and strangers were often astonished at the slight estimation in which he was held. This is human nature: we are unwilling to give up early impressions, or retract expressed opinions. Had a strange actor of equal merits and some reputation, appeared before the same audience, he would instantly have become an object of unmingled admiration. This, however, could not last, and the unequivocal ability displayed by Placide in some parts commanded praise— praise attracted attention, and that was all that was wanted. Since that time he has steadily and rapidly advanced in public estimation—he has never once receded, and his course is still onward. To speak of Placide apart from the character he represents, is difficult. We know that there are a string of set phrases going the rounds of the press, concerning actors “identifying themselves with the part they play,” and “losing themselves in the character they represent,” &amp;c. and, in some sense, this is true, seeing that they frequently lose themselves, the character, the author, and the audience; but in reality, there is not one man in a thousand who possesses the gift of making the audience forget the actor in the part. Even in Kean it was sometimes wanting. It is the highest kind of praise; and as it appears to be fast becoming a settled rule, that all praise, to be worth the having, must be in the superlative, a quality that is peculiar to the few, has been awarded without scruple to the million. Indeed, so very loosely and indiscriminately are these phrases applied, that we should not be surprised to see one of them tacked to a commendation of Barnes, who seldom or never “identifies” himself with any thing, but simply plays Barnes, let him appear in what he will; and so amusing and successful is he in that character, that he cannot do better than stick to it.—But Placide has in truth the faculty of appearing to be the character he assumes; and we would instance as a strong proof of the soundness of this assertion, that of all the imitations of celebrated actors that have been given in this city, not one has been attempted of Placide. And why is this? For the simple reason that he has no peculiarities common to all his characters, and the imitation would not be recognized unless the audience had seen him in the part imitated. Not so with many—Barnes, for instance. Let a good imitation of him be given in any character, and though nine-tenths of the audience have never seen him in that peculiar character, the general resemblance will be instantly appreciated. In articles like the present, which must of necessity be brief, it would be impossible to enter into a minute examination of the various excellencies of Mr. Placide, in the wide range of parts in which he appears. There are three distinct classes in which he is without an equal, namely, old men, or rather middle-aged gentlemen, drunken servants, and kind-hearted, simple country lads. As a sample of the three we would instance the Marquis in the Cabinet, Antonio in the Marriage of Figaro, and Zekiel Homespun in the Heir at Law. In the last he would probably be successful either at Drury Lane or Covent Garden. Upon the whole, he is a fine —almost a faultless actor, with a rich natural vein of humor, free from the alloy of buffoonery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. 16 BARNES. It will not be easy for us to forget the first time we saw this actor. Going into the Park theatre one evening after the performance had commenced, we perceived a person on the boards conducting himself in what appeared to us a very extraordinary manner; though it is not easy to find words clearly to explain what that manner was. He was moving his body across the boards in a most eccentric fashion, throwing his limbs into all sorts of unimaginable positions, ogling, squinting, puffing out his cheeks, and alternately elongating and contracting the muscles of the thin and narrow face of which he was the owner, with the most ridiculous and ludicrous rapidity. The business of the stage was at a stand, and the other actors appeared to wait with exemplary patience for the termination of those curious proceedings; and then they, and this person in particular, played out the rest of the scene in a discreet and proper manner. The people around seemed to take all in good part; while we were lost in astonishment, and knew not which to wonder at most, the impudence of the actor, or the passiveness of the audience. Hinting as much to a gentleman in the vicinity, he smilingly replied that “it was Barnes;” the announcement of which piece of information he seemed to consider as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of what had taken place or of whatever might take place. Verily, there is much truth in the saying, that “custom is second nature.” When Clara Fisher first appeared in this country, every one noticed and talked about the slight lisp which it was then averred she had, though now, nine-tenths of her admirers will deny that any such peculiarity does, or ever did exist. So, though in a greater degree, with Barnes. Custom has so reconciled us to his ways, that we can at present sit and see the manoeuvres with which he intersperses his part, played off, scarcely conscious that they are the same which formerly excited our unmingled astonishment; and if asked to speak of him as we now see him, we should say, that he is one of the most amusing, extravagant, and extraordinary actors we have ever beheld. In the main, he is undoubtedly a man possessed of real sterling comic talent, though not of the most polished kind. He has all the spirit, drollery, and coarseness of one of Cruickshank's caricatures. His buffooneries (if for the lack of another term, so harsh a word may be applied,) are the best species of that bad genus, inimitable of their kind, and less offensive than those of any other actor; and he has so intermixed them with every thing he does, that there is no separating the good from the bad, the wheat from the tares, so that his best efforts are sprinkled with defects, and his worst marked with many redeeming qualities. No man takes a liberty with his audience so frequently as Barnes, and no man does it so well, Others stop half way, as if conscious that they were doing wrong, and fail; Barnes, on the contrary, treats the audience like an old friend—places unlimited confidence in their good nature, and succeeds; for they seem to feel that it would be unkind to repay this confidence with any thing else than a laugh at his good, bad, or indifferent jokes. It would be folly to say that Mr. Barnes was any thing like a faultless performer, but he is a great deal better than many who approach nearer that character. He is an original, and one whom you like sometimes, even in spite of your judgment: and, let him play what he will, his appearance is always welcome. There are two classes of persons who form an undue estimate of Barnes. First, the vulgar, who admire prodigiously and applaud vociferously, the contortions and distortions of his visage, and are, for the most part, incapable of admiring any thing else; and, secondly, the over fastidious, who, pretending to an extraordinary purity of taste, judge him by his defects rather than by his merits, and, for a few unseemly excrescences, condemn a man of first-rate talents as merely a low actor. This is injustice in the highest degree. In nearly the whole of the extensive range of characters he sustains, the sterling ore is in the proportion of ten to one to the alloy; and in all the shades of old men, he may be pronounced uniformly good. There is a truth in his conception, and even a minute delicacy of finish in his representation of the lowest and most degraded stages of humanity—of extreme dotage and drivelling imbecility, that are superlatively fine. In old misers too,—rascals clinging with desperate inveteracy to this world and its concerns, yet fearful and anxious about the future— trembling at eternity and grasping at a guinea— such as Nicholas, in Secrets Worth Knowing, or 16* Silky, in the Road to Ruin, he is altogether unequalled:—the tottering step—the greedy, ghastly, and suspicious look—and the sharp, broken, and querulous voice, form an impressive and pitiable picture of human nature; and yet Mr. Barnes's reputation is founded less on these than on far inferior efforts, such as Mawworm, &amp;c. There is another class of old men, of a vigorous, passionate, and self-willed temperament, such as Restive in Turn Out, and Col. Hardy, in Paul Pry, in which he is nearly if not equally happy. Upon the whole there is a very great deal to admire in Barnes, with scarcely any thing, when once familiar with him, that is really offensive. And his faults too are not altogether his own, but are in some measure continued, if not created, by the public. For instance, when, as Sir Peter Teazle, in the screen scene, he relates the unkindness of his wife, and is moved to tears, the audience invariably catch at the application of the handkerchief to his eyes as an infallible one for them to laugh, thinking that the griefs of Barnes must of necessity be ludicrous; and, do all he can, he cannot make them comprehend that it is possible for him to enact a part where it is necessary to go through a little decorous sorrow, and affect to shed tears in earnest. As it is very hard for a man to have his griefs laughed at, Barnes in turn laughs at grief; and a dose of him in the evening, taken the last thing before going to bed, is as good an antidote for the spleen as Colman's “Broad Grins.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HILSON. We now come to the last, though assuredly not the least, of the comic trio, whose efforts, as much as any thing else, have gained for the Park that high character which it at present enjoys; for it is not the half-dozen appearances of an eminent performer that give an enduring reputation to a theatre, but the combined and well-directed efforts of a fixed company. There is a strange way of acquiring histrionic fame in this land, by a curious process denominated “starring,” which is carried into effect somewhat in this manner: a man, after cogitating upon the subject, becomes impregnated with a high opinion of his own very moderate abilities, and determines forthwith to enlarge his sphere of action; he packs up his baggage and goes forth, scouring over the country in all directions, and becoming at intervals visible, for a few nights, first at one city and then at another; this continues for some time, when the gentleman returns, invested with all the privileges and immunities of a star, and impudently “lords it o'er his betters,” though by what claim of metaphysical reasoning a man becomes more ably qualified to play Shakspeare or Sheridan by travelling a few hundred miles in a steamboat, is not exactly apparent. But so it is, and these luminaries at present abound. Stars, forsooth! (the use of this slang term is very disagreeable, but there is no helping it;) why nine-tenths of them are no better than tallow candles—rush-lights—who emit a feeble, twinkling ray, till they come in contact with some slight change in the breath of public favor, when they disappear on the instant, and nothing but smoke remains. They ought to be snuffed out by the dozen. We have wandered away from the subject more immediately in hand, being filled with virtuous indignation against those theatrical pedlers, in whose behalf a great portion of the public sneer at their more modest and stationary brethren;—as if locomotion were a virtue and a change of intellect was the consequence of a change of air.—Mr. Hilson is no star, and the New-York people ought to be thankful for it; or what would they have done for their Nipperkins, Numpos, Figaros, Paul Prys, Drs. Ollapod and Pangloss, and a whole host of worthies that nobody else can play; together with a hundred parts that might be mentioned in which he is unrivalled!—Hilson's humor is not of the sly, quiet, and unconscious kind, like Placide's—nor of the broad and familiar, like Barnes'—it is of a more bustling and vivacious quality, and in parts full of gaiety and motion, shifts and stratagems—such as intriguing footmen or lying valets—he is in his element. No man has a finer or quicker eye for the ridiculous: there are a number of things which take place in the business of the scene that do not admit of previous study, and Hilson sees in a moment where a look or motion will add effect to an accident, or heighten the absurdity of a situation. This is of great advantage to him at all times, but more particularly in characters of a burlesque description, such as Bombastes Furioso and Abrahamides, which he performs to admiration. But there is another ground on which Mr. Hilson may be taken, and on which he possesses an immense advantage over his two comic brethren, Barnes and Placide, namely, in the exhibition of strong deep feeling, and rough violent passions; and this is, perhaps, his most perfect line, being altogether free from the follies before noticed. What effect he gives to the dead-weight character of Rolamo in Clari! and in stern, blunt and unfortunate veterans, of every description, he has the field all to himself —there is no competitor to contend with him. Who is there that has seen his Robert Tyke, and forgotten it? Unfortunately we never beheld the late John Emery in this, his favorite part, though we have Rayner, his successor at Covent Garden, and a number of others, but not one of them is to be compared with Hilson. This character is, perhaps, the best of Morton's crude conceptions. Tyke is a malefactor and a low and reckless vagabond, though still with some remnants of better feeling hanging about him; and, when his remorse is awakened by circumstances, it requires a person of no common mind to depict the passions and sufferings of the uneducated villain.—There are plenty who appear in it that can display a superabundance of bodily exertion, and do very well if you will accept gesticulation for feeling—that can rant and foam at the mouth—that can look like ruffians, act like ruffians, and gabble bad Yorkshire;—but all that is not playing Tyke. Very little is hazarded in saying, that, in the United States, there is but one man who can do justice to Robert Tyke, and that man is Thomas Hilson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CLARA FISHER When nature quits the even tenor of her way to form a prodigy, and manufactures clay out of the ordinary routine of business, to which long habit has accustomed her, she generally does herself no credit, but instead of a beauty spot, drops a blot upon the fair face of creation—a wart—an excrescence. Her commonest freaks in this way are—giants and dwarfs—learned pigs—calves with two heads, which those with only one throng to see—or calculating youths, like famous Master Bidder, who go through the arithmetic without flogging, and know by intuition that two and two make four. But of all her prodigies, the precocious theatrical prodigy is the most to be dreaded and avoided. It is in general a pert little creature, which has been taught to repeat certain words like a parrot, and drilled to imitate certain actions like a monkey, and is then stuck upon the stage for “children of a larger growth” to gape and wonder at, and applaud for no better reason than because it is six years old and two feet odd inches high, as if all man and womankind had not been, at one period of their lives, just as old and as high. To sit and witness the abortive attempts of such animalcules, when there are full grown men and women in the world, is about as sensible as to eat green fruit when one can get ripe. We always eschewed these small evils; and though having numerous opportunities, could never be prevailed upon, same few years back, to go and see the then little Miss Clara Fisher represent Gloster, “that bloody and devouring boar;” Hamlet, Shylock, or any other appropriate character; and hearing that she was on her way to this country, we thought Mr. Simpson had done a very foolish thing, and made many wise predictions to the effect that she would be found altogether worthless and good for nothing.—Perhaps no one ever entered a theatre more full of prejudice than we did against the young and blooming girl, just bursting into womanhood, who at that moment came forward upon the stage, and dropped one of the most graceful curtsies that ever woman made, to the admiring audience. We expected to see something small, impertinent, and disagreeable; but instead, here was a sight of all others most grateful to the eye—a beautiful female VOL. II. 17 exerting herself to please, and a load of unkindly feelings was at once swept away. The first three acts of the piece (The Will) exhibited some agreeable acting, though nothing extraordinary; but when, in the fourth, she gave “The Bonnets of Blue,” with all the fire and enthusiasm of a devoted follower of “Charlie the chief o' the clan,” an instantaneous and total renunciation of all preconceived opinions took place; and before she had finished her personation of the four Mowbrays, we were thoroughly convinced that Clara Fisher was one of the most natural, charming, clever, sensible, sprightly actresses that ever bewitched an audience, and to that opinion we ever have since firmly adhered. In form and feature Clara Fisher is neither dignified nor beautiful, but she is irresistibly fascinating, and that is better than all the dignity and beauty in the world. Her form is finely proportioned—smoothly and gracefully rounded, with more of the Hebe than the sylph about it, and when in motion most flexible and waving. Her face, as was said of Mrs. Jordan's, “is all expression, without being all beauty.” There is no word that will exactly characterize it: “pretty,” is unmeaning, and it does not strictly come up to the idea conveyed by the word “handsome.” It is at all times, however, a very charming face, even when in a state of calm repose; but when the passion of the scene stirs the mind within, and that mind is reflected in the countenance—when the eloquent eye is lighted up by feeling, and the smooth cheeks clustered with smiles and dimples, then that face is indeed lovely.—In appropriate gesture and action she is most “express and admirable.” This is, in fact, one of her most prominent characteristics; and if we were asked in what particular Clara Fisher was superior to any other actress, we should answer, in the perfect grace and freedom of her motions. In this respect she is a little English Vestris; and if any one doubts it, let him pay particular attention to the singularly appropriate beauty of her action in singing the spirited Scotch ballad before alluded to: the toss of her head which accompanies the utterance of the word “hurrah,” is precisely the one thing that Matthews cannot imitate. She is one of nature's actresses. Perhaps no one ever so completely possessed the faculty of mobility, or entered with more keen enjoyment into the spirit of the part represented. Her whole soul appears to be in every thing she does, and we believe it is not only so in seeming, but in reality. From the infinite variety of characters in which she appears, it would exceed all reasonable bounds to enter into an analysis of them. The days of her Richard and Shylock are, it is to be hoped, over for ever, though there were many sensible things in both these parts —correct conceptions and original and spirited readings, which older heads might adopt with advantage; but it was vexing to see a young and beautiful girl in such a part as Shylock, and the better she played it, the more provoking it was. In comedy there is a glorious and boundless prospect before her, and it is there she appears most perfectly at home. To the high-flown fashionable dames of genteel comedy she cannot as yet do justice, though the time may come when she will do so. One thing is against her. In the lady of high life there is much that is artificial. Now Miss Fisher is too natural for such characters; her spirits are too wild and untameable to be “cabin'd, cribbed, confined, bound in,” by the ordinances of a highly polished state of society. Her fine ladies are consequently full of brilliant points—excellent in detached scenes and sentences, but not in keeping as a whole. In parts where nature has fair play, such as Peggy in the Country Girl, or Phebe in Paul Pry, “none but herself can be her parallel.” How different from these, yet how delightful in itself, was her Viola in Twelfth Night. We were never before so conscious of the extreme sweetness of her “small, delicate voice,” as when giving utterance to the exquisite poetry which Shakspeare has put into the mouth of “brown Viola.” It was in truth “most musical, most melancholy.” The reputation of Clara Fisher has, in a great measure, been built on her representation of the more eccentric parts of the drama, such as the Mowbrays, Little Pickles, &amp;c. and of their kind they are perfect specimens of dramatic excellence. Some may think these are at the best but trifling affairs; we do not. A delineation true to nature is a rare thing, and well worth looking after in whatever shape it is to be found. Miss Fisher has rather a penchant for male attire, which is not to be wondered at, for it becomes her well: all other women whom we have seen wear the inexpressibles in public, cannot forget their sex, but betray throughout a smirking consciousness that they are feminine, and are of course for the most part awkward and embarrassed; she appears to forget her dress and all other minor considerations in the character she is representing. Before coming to a conclusion, a few words about her singing. Perhaps no one with such limited powers of voice, ever equalled Miss Fisher in the effect which she gives to a song. She 17* not only sings it, but acts it in the most arch and spirited or tender and impressive manner. Her face is a mirror where every sentiment of humor or feeling expressed in the verse is reflected. What a delightful piece of pleasantry is her “Fall not in love;” and how tame and vapid any of her little simple ballads sound when sung afterwards by vocalists of superior pretensions. But there is no end to her varied qualifications, and there seems to be scarcely any limit to her powers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RONZI VESTRIS. — When you do dance, I wish you A wave o'the sea, that you might ever do Nothing but that; move still—still so, and own No other function —Shakspeare. We were born upon a spot of earth where feet are used for prosaic rather than poetical purposes, and where they are looked upon merely as appendages which it would be singular and inconvenient to be without. Independent of the ordinary business of life, walking and running matches, leaping, or any other hardy and vigorous exercises, were the affairs in which their services were commonly required; though, to be sure, the people did at times assemble, and voluntarily undergo and perform a violent and eccentric motion, by them termed dancing; but, as regarded all the graceful uses to which feet, and the limbs to which they are more immediately attached, might be brought by scientific cultivation, not an idea was entertained, and not a glimmering of light had been diffused on the subject. Dancing was there in a primitive state, or rather, it was worse— like the Russians, hovering between barbarism and civilization, with all the bad properties of both, and little of the good of either. The freedom and untaught grace of nature were gone, without any of the beautiful combinations and surprising achievements of art being substituted in their place. To a spectator, it seemed as if the parties engaged (the men at least) were, without any perceivable reason, subjecting themselves to a rough and somewhat disagreeable exercise. By a violent exertion of the muscles, the body was forced bolt-upright into the air, whence, as soon as the impetus had ceased, it returned as speedily as possible to the floor, which it no sooner touched, than another desperate effort again propelled it upward, and so on, until nature was exhausted. We had indeed at times misgivings if this could really be dancing; an art that was said to consist of a series of the most skilful and picturesque movements; and as we read of the Asiatic girls, the Greeks, Herodias, Mercandotti, Deshays, and others eminent in that line, we marvel exceedingly; but any expressed opinion on the subject was instantly put down by a reference to the high professional character of the two gentlemen who had the superintendence of the heels of the springing generation in that portion of the globe. In the course of time we beheld many professional artists (English ones) at theatres and other public places, and always felt relieved when they got through their work; and the performance of the Winnebago Indians nearly convinced us that dancing in all nations, whether savage or civilized, was a foolish abomination. The appearance, however, of Hutin, and the French corps de ballet, threw some light upon the subject. The dancers of a nation of dancers were brought to the American shores to expound the mysteries of the Academie de la Musique. The essence, the quintessence of dancing, was what was expected, and had Vestris never appeared, it might still have passed for such. Here, at least, was some approach to an union of grace and agility; while the boldness and novelty of the spectacle threw the audience into a state of most undignified surprise. They did not know exactly what to make of it, but took it for granted that it must be superlatively fine, and consequently counterfeited an exuberance of admiration; but when, in the pas seul of “I've been roaming,” Hutin came bounding like a stag from the top to the bottom of the stage in about three springs, the connoisseurs in the pit were really amazed; they looked into each other's faces for information, but not finding any, grinned a smile of approbation; and many were heard to give utterance to the oracular exclamation of “no mistake!” a term by which no small portion of the inhabitants of this city intimate their sense of excellence in any shape. But Vestris, the exquisite Vestris appeared, and all that had gone before seemed poor in comparison. With a form cast in nature's happiest mould, and a face to match; with “Motions graceful as a bird's in air;” with a step as free as fancy, agile as an antelope, and elastic as a bow, who was to be compared with her? When contrasted with her, the movements of all the rest were sharp and angular. Their performance was a collection of brilliant points—hers one uninterrupted piece of perfection. We did not want to see her dance, only to behold her in motion. She could even do that hardest of all things—violate nature gracefully; for it must be owned that some of her attitudes are such as nature never dreamt of, though this is a fault, perhaps, inseparable from the French school. Of the faults of that school she has less than any of the rest, especially the practice of twirling rapidly round on one foot to please the vicious taste, and gain the good-for-nothing applause of those whose ignorant wonder is excited by this vulgar and marvelously ungraceful trick. In the slow parts of some of the dances her action is in reality the very “poetry of motion:”—the swell and fall of the summer sea—the waving grace of the rich meadow when the breeze passes gently over it—the peculiar sweep of the branches of the willow, which, even at their largest growth, seem constructed of the most delicate fibres—or, indeed, any thing that is most beautiful in motion, is, at times, not more beautiful than Vestris. And, as the music takes a quicker and bolder measure, with what nerve and confidence she spurns the boards and throws herself in air! When we think of it, we look at the pedestals on which our own trunk is supported, and “inly ruminate” what quantity of cultivation would be necessary to enable them to accomplish such feats! There is another advantage in seeing Vestris, particularly to persons whose ideas, like our own, are involved in more than Egyptian darkness concerning pirouettes, entrechats, &amp;c. and who might expose their ignorance and get into an awkward dilemma by asserting that Estelle was better than Ravenot, or Ravenot better than Estelle. When Vestris is before them they are safe. They can lean back at their ease—assume a knowing and intelligent look—nod complacently at the execution of any surprising manæuvre, and indulge in the most sweeping eulogiums without fear of committing themselves; for she is — “such a dancer Where men have eyes and feelings she must answer.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RICHINGS. Notwithstanding the manifold dramatic sins and improprieties of this great man and multifarious actor, he is by no means a disagreeable or unentertaining personage. Some of his efforts are highly amusing; and at all times he at least never fails in securing his own most decided approbation, as is quite evident from the everlasting smile of self-complacency which irradiates his very good-looking countenance; and, be it remarked, that in these captious, fault-finding, universal-diffusion-of-knowledge times, when every one who turns over an author or looks at an actor or picture, feels in duty bound to furnish forth his mite of carping criticism, in order to make manifest the preternatural acuteness it has pleased heaven to invest him with, a confirmed habit of self-approval is by no means an uncomfortable quality. It is really a pleasure to any man who delights in witnessing the happiness VOL II. 18 of his fellow-creatures, to see Mr. Richings make his entry on the stage in a character which requires that he should be arrayed in goodly apparel. How happy, how exuberantly happy he is! Joy sparkles in his eyes, and his physiognomy is radiant with smiles! Perhaps the individual in the play whom he undertakes to represent, is some poor unfortunate, afflicted with debt or other dire distress. But what of that? Is any person so unreasonable as to expect Mr. Richings will for that hang his nether lip, and look dolorously at the audience? No—his face is an index of his mind— gladness reigns there, and the sorrows of the personage whose name and situation he assumes, are far too remote and abstracted to counterbalance the inspiriting feelings produced by a well-fitting fashionable coat and an unimpeachable pair of inexpressibles. And who will say that this is copying nature abominably? Copying nature! why it is nature itself, as may be seen exemplified in a hundred instances, with a few slight modifications, any fine day on the shady side of Broadway.—Yet, for all this, the stage-manager at the Park will sometimes set this gentleman—this very Mr. Richings, to play tragedy. Misjudging Mr. Barry! Search for some lean bilious wretch, to speak blank verse and administer arsenic. Is this a man to “move the waters,” or awake the tender feelings by dabbling in the pathetic, and rehearsing his griefs and sorrows? His griefs and sorrows! why the audience would look in his well-conditioned frontispiece, and see at once that it was a palpable untruth—a barefaced attempt to impose upon their sympathies. Still, he is at times compelled to do this, which perturbs his spirit very much, and causes him to grow furious, and then he does so “roar, that it would do any man's heart good to hear him;”—and it does do the hearts of many good—and the ears of many good, who delight in, and are excited by, loud sounds; and they pronounce it “great,” and clap their hands, as much as to say, “let him roar again, let him roar again.' As a vocalist Mr. Richings is rather distinguished by force than sweetness; and as a comedian, many of his efforts, like Cumberland's comedies, are not to be laughed at. There is a fine balance of mental and physical qualifications in him: if at times his sentences are badly put together, and his periods inelegantly turned, his shoulders might furnish hints to a statuary in both those respects; and though his conceptions be ever so faulty, a more faultless leg cannot be conceived. Indeed, in personal appearance, he is model of a man. In the mental department he has sundry objectionable properties, the greatest of which is an over-abundance of facetiousness, which finds vent in the shape of manufactured pieces of pleasantry that are ever and anon thrown in the face of the audience; some of those extempore coruscations at times elicit a laugh from a few choice spirits, who are particularly quick at catching any thing that sounds like a joke, though the majority are generally at a loss to discover in what the jest consists; and this practice has the unfortunate tendency of occasionally leading to the belief that Mr. Richings, like Sir Andrew Aguecheek, has, at times, “no more wit than a christian or an ordinary man.” Like that immortal knight too, he looks as if he were “a great eater of beef,” and perchance that “does harm to his wit.” Altogether, however, Mr. R. is a useful performer, and evidently strives to please. From a very miserable actor he has already become quite a respectable one, and in some parts has really evinced considerable comic talents. Besides, he has been a long time at the Park threatre, and all who have been there for any considerable period, even the worst (amongst whom we are far from classing Mr. R.) acquire from the good company that surrounds them and the audience before which they appear, a certain look and manner of conducting themselves, that give them the appearance of gentlemen, at least comparatively speaking. When Mr. Richings transported himself to the regions of the La Fayette, he actually moved like a demi-god among the scum and refuse that latterly congregated there. It is to be hoped he will not again migrate from his present quarters. We should be sorry to miss his good-humoured, good-looking face, and his unique manner of doing some things. Besides, he is an improving actor, and may he long continue so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">18* MRS. WHEATLEY. The clever and facetious author of “Sayings and Doings,” in one of his admirable tales, makes a country manager remark, that “in the theatrical profession heroines and sentimental young ladies are as plentiful as blackberries, but that a good old woman is invaluable; and all who are tolerably conversant with the affairs of the stage, very well know, that in one respect, at least, the order of nature is reversed, and that a fine old woman is more desirable than a young one. It is not difficult to account for this. We think the observation may be hazarded that females, generally speaking, prefer dimples to wrinkles; and so the young ladies very naturally refuse to anticipate the time when nature will compel them to appear as old ones, and the old ladies, whose ideas and reminiscences are juvenile, as pertinaciously object to personate any thing but young ones, thinking, doubtless, it would be folly to surrender into the hands of youth and inexperience, those parts which time and practice has so well enabled them to perform. Bent on charming to the last, we have seen, with fear and trembling, a very fat old woman of fifty as Juliet, lolling over the frail and creaking balcony, while a short, pursy, and somewhat asthmatic Romeo came waddling to his love, puffing out— “How softly sweet sound lover's tongues by night!” The truth is, that the personation of old women is a very thankless branch of theatrical business, and the same quantity of ability which, employed in it, meets with comparative neglect, would, in a more enticing line of character, draw down thunders of applause. This may in some degree acccount for the meagre and scanty mention which is made of Mrs. Wheatley by the press of this city. She is seldom noticed, and when she is, it is generally in one of those unmeaning commendations which are at intervals dealt out to every worthless appendage of a green-room, such as she “was quite at home,” or “went through her part with spirit,” or any other ready-coined phrase. For our own part, we have the highest opinion of Mrs Wheatley, and think there is little ventured in saying, that she is not only the best actress in her line on this continent, but the best beyond all comparison; and in all the theatres in which, in various parts, we have occasionally been present, out of London we have never seen her equal. Where is there another Mrs. Malaprop in this country? Or indeed, in all the range of ridiculous old ladies, who, like her, can give the height of absurdity without the taint of vulgarity? There is all the difference in the world between making such a character as Mrs. Malaprop a coarse, ignorant old woman, and a foolish old lady. And herein lies the excellence of Mrs. Wheatley; however her “nice derangement of epithets” may betray her ignorance, her appearance and manners show she is not one of the canaille, but familiar at least with the forms and manners of a drawing-room. In the composition of her dress too, from “top to toe” there is not a vulgar curl or color. But it is not in this line alone that Mrs. W. can lay claims to distinction. Her talents are as versatile as they are excellent, and her chambermaids, if not marked by the same evident superiority, have a pertness and spirit about them that are always amusing. There is one character that she plays, (a very disagreeable one) which in her hands is one of the most perfect efforts we have witnessed on the boards of a theatre, viz. Mrs. Subtle in Paul Pry. Every expression of her countenance, and every modulation of her voice, are imbued with the spirit of art and demure hypocrisy. There is another thing worthy of remark. Mrs. Wheatley, though the representative of age, is herself in the prime of life and full vigor of intellect. This is an advantage as great as it is rare; for the line of character in which she appears, is generally used as a dernier resort by actresses, who are themselves too old to appear in any thing else, and who bring to their task confirmed habits, and jaded and worn out powers of mind and body. According to the common course of nature, it will be long before the public will have to regret this as being the case with Mrs. Wheatley; and even when time shall have laid his unsparing hand upon her, her excellence in the execution of those parts, will have become so much a matter of habit, that only the physical force and energy will be wanting. The faults of this lady are so few, that it is scarcely worth while pointing them out. The greatest is, that she is not always proof against the applause of the more noisy part of the audience; so that when she does any thing particularly well, and a clapping of hands ensues, she wishes to do more, and is in the habit of spreading out the folds of her ample and antique garments, and flouncing about the stage more than is exactly necessary. As long, however, as Mr. Simpson retains the services of Mrs. Wheatley in the Park company, that theatre will be possessed of an attraction which no other establishment can, at present, or is likely to equal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BARRY AND WOODHULL. These two performers are as opposite as the antipodes, and we place them together for the sake of contrast. Their style of acting is as dissimilar as may be. Woodhull is as unbending as iron— Barry as yielding as wax. In the expression of passion, Woodhull, like a flint, must be struck sharply before he emits a spark of fire—while Barry, like a rocket, is off in a blaze, at the slightest touch. The one is as hard as granite—the other as flexible as silk; and if, by any process, the qualities of the two could be compounded together, a fine actor would be the result. In melo-dramas, where murders have to be committed, or any other unlawful transaction carried on, they mostly hunt in couples. Both are generally scoundrels, but scoundrels with a difference. Woodhull is the stanch, obdurate villain—Barry the weak and wavering sinner. The one has “no compunctious visitings of nature”— the other is “too full o' the milk of human kindness, to catch the nearest way.” Barry murders like a novice, while Woodhull does his work with the easy self-possession of a professional gentleman. In the end, too, when poetical justice comes to be awarded, they consistently die in character—the one marches to the gallows as “cool as a cucumber,” while the other in some fit of repentance, cheats the law by bursting a blood-vessel, or going off in a fit of apoplexy. For the truth of all this we appeal to nine-tenths of the melo-dramas that have been or may be enacted at the Park theatre, in which these gentlemen have heretofore appeared or may hereafter appear. Mr. Barry is an actor with many faults, but still one that may safely be called a good actor—a title which, when fairly deserved, a man may be proud of, for it implies the possession of much and varied ability. He is a good actor, and there is nothing to prevent his being a better. Nature has given him a handsome face, a graceful person, and a full and mellow voice. Added to these advantages, his conception of his part is generally correct, and his execution spirited. The great fault of Mr. Barry is exaggeration—exaggeration in every variety of shape; but principally exaggeration in action, and this pervades, more or less, every thing he does. When he should be out of temper, he is in a passion, and when he should be in a passion, he is in a frenzy; when he should tremble for a moment, he shakes for a minute; and when flourishing a sword or any thing else, where once would do, he invariably does it twice; and so on, even to the veriest trifle, the same spirit exists. In some parts he is a complete fever and ague; and in characters where he has to look upon a spectre, an injured friend, or any thing of that sort, he daubs his face —particularly under the eyes—with some vile composition which gives him the appearance of an animated corpse: a new way, we presume of painting the passions. When Mr. Barry has a mind, he can do what not one in a hundred can, that is, read poetry properly. He pronounces distinctly, minds his stops, accentuates his words with judgment, and modulates the tones of his voice with good effect; but let any of the dramatis personæ put this same Mr. Barry in a passion, and off he goes, laying, without discretion, a most astounding emphasis on every second or third word, which makes the dialogue jolt along like a hard-trotting horse; a proceeding which gains him a good deal of applause and no credit. We have now found all the fault we can consistently with truth, with Mr. Barry, and have dwelt VOL. II. 19 so much the longer on what we consider his failings, because he has good qualities enough to make it well worth while to tell him of his bad ones; and moreover, because those bad ones are of such a nature as could be easily amended. With “all his imperfections on his head,” he has few equals, and no superior here as a melo-dramatic actor; and there are parts of a higher grade where his besetting sins are kept under by the nature of the character; such as the Duke Aranza, in the Honey Moon, which, we think he plays better than any man in the country. There is also a species of genteel comedy in which he is very agreeable. We have but little space left for remarks on that much-enduring man, Mr. Woodhull. And what can be said of him, more than that he is one of the most useful and ill-used actors that ever trod the boards of a theatre! Who can particularize Mr. Woodhull's line of character? It is enough to make the head ache to think of what he has to go through in a single month. A few weeks ago we hinted at his blood-thirsty propensities on the stage, and he still goes on adding to his dramatic crimes; qut this is only a single branch of his extensive business. He plays old misers and young spendthrifts, greybeards and lovers, walking gentlemen and half-pay officers, soldiers, sailors, Irishmen, Scotchmen, Dutchmen, Jews, Gentiles, French tailors and Indian savages; and all this work is done without offence; and most of it with satisfaction to the audience. What incalculable quantities of trash have to pass through his unfortunate brain and be impressed upon his memory! What floods of nonsense have to issue from his mouth! Night after night, week after week, month after month, and year after year—in play, in interlude, and in farce, there is Mr. Woodhull! and yet, notwithstanding the wear and tear that his intellect must have suffered from such courses, his brain appears untouched—his sense continues perfect, and he yet goes through his multifarious business with more propriety and rationality than many a would-be star.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. HILSON. There is no actress who has run the risk of injuring a well-earned reputation more than this lady. She plays all and every thing; and though we should be the last to advocate the whims and airs of actors, in refusing parts which they consider beneath them, or unsuited to their abilities, yet there is no reason why any of them should absolutely sacrifice themselves in the cause of the theatre. We have seen Mrs. Hilson, in a short space of time, play Ophelia, Dolly Bull, and Lady Macbeth, together with various other incongruities; yet, in our estimation, Mrs. Hilson is by no means a lady of versatile abilities. She has not the faculty of mobility, and, except in a limited degree, is not at home either in comedy, tragedy, or farce;—and yet there are a hundred parts in which she is far superior to any one else. When we remark that Mrs. Hilson is not at home either in comedy, tragedy, or farce, we mean in the broad and extreme parts of each. Nature has denied her the physical requisites for such efforts, and the exhibition of violent passions or emotions of any kind is not her forte; but in beings like Desdemona, she is unequalled in this country. We have never seen her Imogen in Cymbeline, but have heard it highly spoken of; and a woman that can do justice to such characters as Desdemona and Imogen, ought not to care about excelling in any thing else. Her Ophelia is beautiful, and she performs even Lady Macbeth better than a host of others—with more propriety than Mrs. Sloman, (who by the way, does it very badly,) though perhaps not so effectively; yet she can no more make it what it ought to be, than her husband can do justice to the “worthy thane of Cawdor.” She has not strength and energy for tragedy—she can portray tenderness, but not agony—grief, but not despair. In comedy she is happier, but still not quite at home, and appears to us constitutionally unfitted for it; her temperament is too melancholy to enter into the irrepressible buoyancy of comedy; and though, having an abundance of common sense, a thing a good deal in request upon the boards, she does all she undertakes very well, yet her gaiety, like Clara Fisher's efforts in the pathetic, is only put on;—it does not come from or go directly to the heart— both of them appear warring against their nature. Mrs. Hilson cannot assume the dashing airs and affectation of a lady of quality, or the pertness and 19* volubility of a chambermaid, but in such parts as Mary in John Bull, as Lady Amaranth in Wild Oats, and hundreds of a similar cast—in the Emily Worthingtons and Julia Faulkners of the drama, she is far, very far superior to any actress on this side of the Atlantic. Her heroines do not smack of the stage; the loud protestation and exaggerated action are not there: on the contrary, the quiet grace in every movement, and the sweet and simple earnestness with which the sentiments are delivered, render such personations perfect, and leave her without a rival in this class of character. We never saw what we could call a wrong conception on the part of Mrs. Hilson; and she has always given more pleasure and less dissatisfaction than any one who ever appeared in such a number of characters. There is one thing, for which indeed she ought not to be praised, because it is no more than the performance of a simple duty, but which at least deserves mention in consequence of the flagrant neglect of others, and that is, she always takes the trouble of committing her part to memory, and gives the words of the author instead of thrusting forward foolish impertinencies on the spur of the moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISS KELLY. This popular actress—for popular she undoubtedly is, though why she became so, passes our comprehension—has attained considerable celebrity in a class of characters hitherto very inefficiently represented on this side of the Atlantic, namely, the fashionable ladies of genteel comedy. That Miss Kelly's admirers may be in the right and we in the wrong, is very possible, but we do not think so; and there is more plain dealing than presumption in saying this, because every one, whatever deference or humility he may profess, will secretly prefer his individual opinion to that of the rest of the world. Miss Kelly may play a dashing, dissipated woman or a vixen to admiration, but she does not play a lady. Do females in high life perambulate their drawing-rooms in the fashion that Miss Kelly does the stage? or when they cannot have exactly their own way, do they traverse their apartments with the Bobadil strides with which she tramples over the shrinking boards? We always thought, that whatever might be said of the morals of fashionable females, their manners were more polished and fascinating than those of any other of heaven's creatures. Is it so with those of this lady? Her warmest admirers will probably hesitate to answer in the affirmative?—That Miss Kelly frequently conceives correctly and executes forcibly, no one will deny; and there is a heedless gaiety and unceasing flow of animal spirits about her representations which carry her triumphantly over many faults and difficulties. But, in general, her portraitures are exaggerated and overdone; instead of a delicately finished picture, you see a broad caricature—the colours are laid on with a trowel instead of a pencil—and a perpetual striving after effect is the predominating trait in all. Of Miss Kelly's Beatrice, though it be heresy to say so, we do not think highly. The spirit which pervades it belongs more to the character of the shrewish Catharine than the lively Beatrice; and the gross violation of the text and meaning of the author—and that author Shakspeare—at the conclusion of the scene where she desires Benedict to “kill Claudio”—gives him her hand to kiss— giggles, and bids him kiss it again—runs to the side wing and gallops back, telling him to “kiss it again,” and to be sure and “kill Claudio—dead”— all which proceedings and language Shakspeare never dreamt of, is an awful and sacrilegious piece of business; and the thunders of applause which it generally brings down, indicate that the house contains a great number of very discriminating people. But whatever diversity of opinion may exist concerning this lady's acting, we should think there could be none about what, out of courtesy we suppose, must be called her singing. She doubtless receives great applause at the conclusion, and with some reason, for we dare say all are thankful that it is well over; but unfortunately some of the citizens, transported beyond the bounds of sober discretion at their emancipation, are so uproariously grateful, that it is mistaken for an encore;—the lady re-enters—curtsies gracefully, and poor Mr. De Luce, as in duty bound, gives the ominous tap which preludes another infliction upon the horror-stricken, bewildered, rash, but well-meaning audience. Then may be heard a rush—an opening of box doors—and gentlemen are seen precipitating themselves with heedless violence into the lobbies to speak with a friend, buy oranges, absorb spirituous liquids, or any thing else, for the space of ten minutes. There is a pithy proverb which intimates that “a burnt child dreads the fire,” and the audience will in time doubtless become more wary. Miss Kelly is very fond of the Mermaid Song; if she would take the trouble of listening once to Mrs. Austin's delightful manner of giving it, it might have the beneficial effect of stopping any further operations on that piece of music. We have spoken plainly of this lady for two reasons: first, because she is as popular as ever, and therefore need not shrink from having her merits canvassed; had she been declining in the public estimation, we should have been the last to say any thing about her, but she still claims to rank as a star, and one of the first magnitude too, and therefore of course lays herself the more open to remark; she enjoys all the privileges and immunities of that station, probably receiving a more liberal remuneration for half a dozen evenings than is awarded to actresses of what we consider decidedly superior abilities, such as Mrs. Hilson and Mrs. Wheatley, for months of unremitting exertion, and with these substantial advantages she ought at least to take the slight disadvantages of such a station. In the second place, Miss Kelly, from appearances, is a woman of spirit, and one not likely to be popped off by a paragraph like John Keats the poet, who, in coroner's language, “came by his death in consequence of a criticism.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MRS. SHARPE. This lady, though a favorite with the public, scarcely holds that place in their estimation which might be expected from her varied and manifold qualifications. The parts, to be sure, in which she generally appears, do not admit of any brilliant display of talent, and therefore Mrs. Sharpe's sensible and spirited manner of performing them only elicits a moderate share of approbation, though the aggregate pleasure derived from her performances is probably greater than from those of many who claim a loftier station in the profession. She is the Mrs. Woodhull of the Park theatre—that is, she holds the same rank in the feminine department, which that worthy gentleman does in the masculine, and is, like him, endowed in a high degree, with the yankee faculty of turning her hand to any thing. She is a very fair singer, an excellent “walking lady,” and a capital comedian. Besides, VOL. II. 20 she has somewhat of a “genius for the tragic,” or rather, a tolerable knack at declamation, and scolds in blank verse “with good emphasis and discretion.” The necessities of the theatre, we presume, caused her to appear once or twice as Elvira during the past season; and although it is a character altogether out of her line, she performed it better than any woman we have seen attempt it on these boards. She looked well as the haughty Spanish beauty—“disdain and scorn rode sparkling in her eyes”—and in the fourth act she rated Pizarro in good round terms. This, however, is not the department in which Mrs. S. must hope to attain excellence. In comedy she is always happy, and divides the chambermaid business with the inimitable Mrs. Wheatley, without losing much by the comparison. She also takes charge of the characters of nearly all the young and middle-aged ladies. Now, there are plenty of actresses who undertake to do the same thing, but unfortunately they cannot change their manners with their dress, and continue just as vulgar in silk as they were in calico; being evidently nothing better than dressedup chambermaids. This is not the case with Mrs. Sharpe, she can scold, lie, and flirt like a waitingwoman, and look, speak, and act like a lady—she can be boisterous in the kitchen, and stately in the hall— and can jilt a footman or reject a knight with equal skill and dexterity. By the way, she has an uncommonly picturesque manner of repulsing improper overtures; when playing an innocent maid, wife, or widow, and any of the stage libertines go down on their knees and unfold their wicked intentions, she has a style of curling her lip, flashing her eye, folding her arms, and drawing up her person with an air of insulted virtue, which must produce a prodigious moral effect upon the kneeling sinner and the attentive audience. In parts, likewise, where an union of good acting and tolerable singing is required, such as Georgette Clairville or Donna Anna, in Don Giovanni, it would be difficult to find her equal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE. “Summer has flown on swallow's wings, And earth has buried all her flowers; No more the lark—the linnet sings— But silence sits in faded bowers.” Spring has ripened into summer, summer has mellowed into autumn, autumn has withered into winter, and now that old vagabond, eighteen hundred and thirty-two (who took away Sir Walter Scott, and spared the emperor Nicholas) has but a few more hours to linger before father Time ejects him out of existence, and hands him over to oblivion for peaceable interment. Well, let him go. The hearty, vigorous eighteen hundred and thirty-three will soon be of age, and come into possession of his estate, this snug, cozy little earth, on which we get our dínners, and perform other pleasurable functions, but at which some people of bad tastes and superfine imaginations pretend to turn up their ungrateful noses, without knowing exactly why. To tell the truth, it is time the property changed hands. There can be no doubt that of late months it has somewhat deteriorated; for, though the old gentleman, who is shortly about to mingle with the shadows of the past, introduced some salutary reforms into certain small portions of his estate, causing divers peculating and unrighteous stewards to resign their trusts; yet a malignant imp, named Cholera, gave him such a fright in the early part of his career, that he never did good afterwards; his nerves tumbled to pieces, he became light-headed, and committed the oddest vagaries imaginable, so that all things went to wreck and ruin; his land remained untilled, his ships lay rotting in his harbors, and none of his tenants prospered excepting doctors, sextons, gravediggers, apothecaries, and undertakers. It is to be hoped that the young heir will bestir himself vigorously, and put things to rights; that he will drown the cholera in the Pacific, “deeper than did ever plummet sound;” chain up the ferocious and insatiable northern bear in his own appropriate regions of darkness and desolation; allow those pugnacious animals, the Dutch and Belgians, to knock their heads together until they find out what they are quarrelling about; or else hand their rulers Homer's 20* “battle of the frogs and mice,” for their especial edification; and take strong measures generally, to prevent his larger tenants from eternally falling out amongst themselves, and pulling to pieces and destroying each other. The weather is appropriate. Old eighteen hundred and thirty-two, thou hast lived amid a peck of troubles, and art about to expire in storm and tempest. The stern north wind—child of the pole— has rushed from his “regions of thick-ribbed ice,” and is roaring and yelling around my domicile, like some infuriated demon: as the “spirit of the storm” occasionally loosens a tile from the roof, or a slate from the chimney, and precipitates it with inconsiderate violence into the street, the important truth is forcibly impressed upon my mind for future guidance, that, “on such a night as this,” the middle of the pavement is indubitably to be preferred to the otherwise more eligible footwalk, by such as are in favor of prolonged vitality. Ever and anon, too, the blusterer sinks from his high tone into a low, lengthened wail, and then sweeping suddenly round some abrupt angle, rises in a succession of whirling eddies, emitting a scream as of one in pain, which is not only highly poetical, but strikingly dramatic —only it makes the chimney smoke, and causes the unfortunate writer to sit ruminating in an atmosphere of uncomfortable density. It is newyear eve! a season that I, for one, always felt an especial delight in. There is about it a mixture of mirth and sadness, of joyous anticipation and melancholy regret, that suits one of my temperament. It is a fitting time, too, for cogitation, and the birth of important and solemn thoughts. A great change is taking place. One year more from our slender stock is on the point of rolling away, to “join the past eternity.” Time is about to close another volume of his works, in which our good and bad deeds are registered, and to lay it quietly by amid the records of what has been, until it is wanted for final inspection. It is “iron-clasped and iron-bound,” and can no more be opened by us. What is written there can never be erased—the slurs and blotches must all go—and that word never ought to make us pause before we stain with foul thoughts, or unmeet actions, the fair clear page of the daybook, which to-morrow will be laid before us. Newyear eve! It is a season for calm, melancholy retrospection—for nearly all retrospection is melancholy—the mind naturally reverts to the past, and images of things that have almost faded away and become forgotten dreams, amid the bustle and hurry of business, and the small cares and meannesses of life crowd vividly back upon the memory. “The eyes that shone, Now dimm'd and gone,” beam on us again through the long vista of departed years, though even with a kinder and mellower lustre than of old; and the good hearts and true, that the cold green grass grows silently over, are again beside us. They, the dead, welcomed in many a newyear with us once, were glad and joyous, and passed the bottle and the jest, and they are gone! The songs they used to sing, and the tones and inflections of their voice, all their little whims and peculiarities, become again clear and distinct. Yet they to whom those things appertained, fine, hearty pieces of flesh and blood, with whom we were hand and glove, and from whom we could not live apart, are really gone—dead and gone! and, alas! for human nature that it should be so, unless at seasons like the present, when a gush of better feeling calls them back, almost forgotten! Among the genial and good old customs prevalent about this time, one, of friends gathering together on a newyear eve, to take their farewell of the departing and welcome the coming year, it is to be hoped will not speedily pass out of fashion. There is more refinement about the conviviality on such an occasion than is common at other seasons; and recollections of the changes and mutations that have taken place since last they met to chant old ditties to “the year that is gone and awa',” have the effect of softening down the otherwise too boisterous hilarity prevalent at festive meetings. And what an expansion of the heart, what an influx of kindly feelings takes place; what old and delightful reminiscences are awakened! With what joyous warmth one good fellow pledges another, and with what a depth of feeling is the common toast, “to absent friends,” given, as each man yearningly thinks, as he slowly raises the glass to his lips, of the dear and distant. Such a scene may not, indeed, be exactly to the taste of the stern and unflinching moralist, the retailer of terse aphorisms and sage prudential saws and maxims, “One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling, Nor form nor feeling, great or small; A reasoning, self-sufficient thing, An intellectual all-in-all.” But for all that, it is a scene at which wisdom need not frown, and where virtue and cheerfulness might with great propriety take a glass together. The newyear day itself. Who will say that happiness is not good for man; and who will say that there is not a greater quantity to be had at a cheaper rate on this day than on almost any other? The atmosphere seems impregnated with the delicious essence. Men smile instinctively as they pass along the streets; and if the ice thereon happens to play them a slippery trick, and they tumble, they complacently gather themselves together again, and go on their way rejoicing; it is newyear-day, and they are not to be put out of humor. Fires blaze brighter in the parlor—so do ladies' eyes; and kitchens emit odors to which those of “Araby the blest,” are faint and powerless; inasmuch as they are not only delicious in themselves, but furnish hints of a higher state of felicity, which “the coming on of time,” (dinner-time,) will probably perfect. I know not any place where this day is more liberally, pleasantly, and judiciously “kept up,” than in New-York. I admire, in an especial degree, the custom of the fair damosels of Manahatta arraying themselves in their most inviting habiliments, and staying at home to dispense unto their several male acquaintances, as they call, generous, exhilarating cordials, or coffee and other sobrieties, as may suit their respective inclinations. It is, however, a trying day for the gentlemen, who have to effuse all the good things they can invent, borrow, or steal, in order to keep up their character for sprightliness, so that there is often a much greater expenditure of wit, than many of the parties can prudently afford. And yet, despite all this, I am afraid that new-year-day, and other old-fashioned celebrations of the sort, are rather getting into disrepute. They are regarded by many as fragments of ancient barbarism—musty relics—remnants of the absurdities of the dark ages, which ought and must, (to quote the slang of the day,) give way before the rapidly increasing spread of intelligence and civilization. And really, the world is getting so very wise, and polished, and polite, that in a little time there will be no such thing as fun or feeling left in it. It may be proper enough that such things should be expunged from our well-behaved and scientific planet, but I doubt it mightily; and I would just hint, that there is a species of civilization prevalent which affects manners rather than morals—forms rather than feelings, which might, by some, be termed superficial; a civilization totally independent of true refinement, but which so smooths and polishes its disciples, that they counterfeit taste, knowledge, and feeling, and pass muster in society very tolerably, excepting when some little trait—some trivial action—some heedless phrase or expression, lays bare the barrenness of their thoughts, and the primeval meanness of their souls. Such folks are incapable of any thing but decorum and commonplace. Newyear-day is nothing to them—they have no sociability; and have besides, a glimmering idea, that it displays a kind of magnanimous and out-of-the-way elevation of mind, to sneer at and decry whatever gives pleasure to the many. But, worse than this, besides being rated as a piece of foolish antiquity, it is made a serious charge against poor newyear day, that, as celebrated at present, it is a vehicle for drunkenness and dissipation, and ought, therefore, to be abolished. I object to such a conclusion, drawn from such premises. Is it any good and sufficient reason, that the sound and well-ordered portion of the community should be deprived of the cheerful pleasures and innocent gaieties, which the recurrence of this and similar days invariably produces, because certain inconsiderate portions of the population, think proper to swallow an indiscreet quantity of anti-rational compounds? Am I to experience a painful degree of aridity, because others choose to swamp themselves with manifold abominations? But it does not signify talking;—man and beast, and all other animals, will follow their natural bent. Asses would still eat thistles, even though grapes grew on every bush—swine would leave the verdant turf, bespangled with the pale primrose and the spring violet, to roll and wallow in congenial mire; and the brutal in mind and coarse in taste have ever made, and will continue to make any departure from the ordinary routine of life a pretext for indulging in their rank and filthy propensities. But what is that to plain, well-meaning people like myself, who do not pretend to know any thing about that most abstract of all the virtues—universal philanthropy?—nothing. And are those who advocate the abolition of new-year-day on the ground of immorality, prepared, at the same time, to insist upon the utility of all festivities and celebrations whatever, sharing a similar fate? If they are not, for consistency's sake they ought to be, for all have one tendency—the encouragement of a greater degree of relaxation and latitude than is ordinarily permitted. Alas! the world is already too mechanical; but were such people to succeed, it would, indeed, be one huge workshop, in which we would toil and moil unceasingly, until death hinted to us that we had been long enough employed. We are already a plodding, mercenary generation; but then we would be regular mill-horses, treading, evermore, the same unvarying round, and all for grist, grist, still grist, until we were in reality as blind and stupid as that most monotonous of quadrupeds. There might be more decorum under such a system—perchance less vice, but assuredly less virtue; and what there was, would be of the most insipid kind. For my own VOL. II. 21 part, I regret the gradual disuse of many of the old festivities and holidays of our ancestors, which were ever and anon recurring to diversify the dullness of existence, by an occasional glimpse of the picturesque. They added to the enjoyment of all classes, particularly of that which stands most in need of added enjoyments. They invigorated the heart, refreshed the feelings, and formed a little episode in the poor man's year, that was looked forward to with gladness, and remembered with satisfaction; besides forwarding the great purpose of creation, by bringing the juvenile of both sexes together in a pleasurable mood, thereby laying a train for an innumerable quantity of matrimonial experiments. But one by one they have withered away before the steady advance of business, and a higher state of civilization—real and counterfeit. Easter and Whitsuntide are now little more than names; and that most delightful of ruralities, dancing round the maypole, and choosing the “queen of May” from the prettiest lass of the village, has become nearly obsolete. Let us, therefore, hold fast by the bright days left us, which periodically encourage innocent gaiety and lightness of heart. Let us still preserve a few green, shady lanes, branching off from the great macadamized turnpike of human life, down which we may stroll for a brief season, and refresh ourselves, by exchanging dust for verdure, flintstones for flowers, and the eternal jangling and bartering of business, for the melody of birds and the murmuring of brooks; even though we lose what the worldly and would-be-wise tell us can never be regained—time and money.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SIR WALTER SCOTT. “Time rolls his ceaseless course. The race of yore Who danced our infancy upon their knee, And told our marvelling boyhood legend's store Of their strange ventures, happ'd by land or sea, How they are blotted from the things that be! How few, all weak and wither'd of their force, Wait on the verge of dread eternity, Like stranded wrecks, the tide returning hoarse, To sweep them from our sight!” Time does indeed “roll his ceaseless course,” and Sir Walter Scott is at length “blotted from the things that be!” The great leveller, death, has achieved one of his mightiest triumphs. Yet even now, when turning over the fresh and glowing pages of him who is no more, it is difficult to bring the truth home to the mind that the “author of Waverley” is really mouldering away amid the withered leaves of winter in Dryburgh kirk-yard! and that the dullest brain in Europe is now more prolific than that which called Meg Merrilies and Marmion, Rob Roy and Roderick Dhu, and hundreds, thousands of the finest creations since Shakspeare, into life and action. Truly, never was the equalization of the grave made more manifest. Long as this mournful event had been anticipated, it still startled men to hear that all was over. They paused, and looked aghast, and then strode silently away to marvel how such a thing could be; and since the death of Byron, no single event has created such an overpowering—such an enduring sensation among those who think and feel. Both these great characters died as became them, calmly and bravely; and the circumstances connected with their respective deaths, are not a little characteristic of the men. Byron perished as he had lived, lonely and deserted, on a foreign shore, in a fruitless attempt to right the wrongs of that land whose glories and sufferings he has embalmed in his undying numbers; while the death of Scott was probably accelerated by his unquenchable desire to gaze once more upon “the scenes he loved and sung,” and to make his final resting-place in “his own, his native land!” This feeling seems to have amounted to a passion. The garden of the world displayed her charms for him; but he gazed with a dull and filmy eye on the luxuriant beauties of nature, and the magnificent triumphs of art, ennobled, too, by association with all that was grand and mighty in a bypast age. How would all this have stirred his spirit at another period! But the time was past. The 21* hand of the destroyer was upon him; the blood was fast curdling around his noble heart, and the soft and balmy odors of a southern clime came all too late to infuse health and vigor into his decaying frame. He turned sickeningly away, yearning once again “To feel the breeze down Ettricke break, Though it might chill his withered cheek:” and on his return, the nearer he approached his country, the stronger this desire became, until, on his arrival in London, he would scarcely brook the necessary—the indispensable delays which his situation required. His only thought and cry was to reach Scotland; thus giving his dying testimony to the truth of that fine apostrophe written in his prime, showing the deep and rooted feelings of the man, as well as the inspiration of the poet: “O Caledonia! stern and wild! Meet nurse for a poetic child! Land of brown heath and shaggy wood, Land of the mountain and the flood, Land of my sires! what mortal hand Can e'er untie the filial band That knits me to thy rugged strand!” Mankind owes Scott a debt of gratitude which it can never liquidate. The untiring admiration of succeeding generations may cancel the interest, but he must ever remain creditor for the principal until the language in which he has written shall have become a forgotten tongue. I would fain pay a portion of my tribute of thankfulness for the many, many hours of pure pleasure his works have afforded me, in a few scattered remarks, though it almost looks like presumption to do so. Criticism, is out of the question. Criticism, as far as Scott is concerned, should now, methinks, go to sleep, at least for a while. Eulogies—rhapsodies, (absurd or otherwise,) may be tolerated; but formal, frigid criticism, especially from those “whose names are written on the roll of common men,” now that the manes of the great magician are scarcely cold, would be little better than sacrilege. I shall never forget the first time I read Marmion. I was just then emerging from Jack-the-giant-killerism, and similar juvenile portions of the belles-letters—a mere lad, with an “ogre-like appetite” for books of all descriptions, which I despatched with most uncritical precipitancy. Marmion came in my way one summer evening. I read it half through, thought and dreamed of it the rest of the night, and finished it before leaving my bed the next morning. This was certainly devouring a six-canto poem with a most unsophisticated appetite, and without the slighest attempt to make an epicurean selection of tit-bits; good and bad, faults and beauties, were then swallowed indiscriminately in the vulgar excitement caused by an interesting narrative, which some mature people have had the hardihood to assert, is, after all, the main excellence of Scott's poetical compositions. I can only judge for myself. I have read Marmion many and many a time since then, (certainly not for the story,) and the flavor has not yet departed from its pages. Though the opinion has of late years been rather unfashionable, I cannot help regarding it as a noble, spirited, and perfectly original poem—a sort of irregular border epic, abounding in beauties of the highest order. It is its misfortune rather than its fault, (like the rest of Scott's productions,) to have a story of such intense interest as to absorb, in an undue degree, the attention of the reader, diverting his mind from the more unobtrusive beauties of the work. He is so hurried away by the constant shifting of the scenes and the rapid introduction of character, that he has but scant time to note the simple wild-flowers scattered in his path. The whole poem is a succession of bold, vivid sketches, rather than of elaborately finished pictures; all thrown off with an air of careless freedom that somewhat tempts the reader to rein in his admiration of what is obviously effected with so little trouble. Yet it would be difficult to point out, even in the most deep-wrought efforts of our best poets, any thing superior or equal to the trial and condemnation of Constance de Beverley, the quarrel between Marmion and Douglas, the battle of Flodden, and the death of Marmion; though, in fact, it is nonsensical to make such a challenge, inasmuch as no similar passages are to be found in any other author, ancient or modern. They are unique, and must be judged by themselves alone. It is characteristic of genius to strike out some distinctly new path of its own, and for talent to follow after as it best may. There was no model for Paradise Lost, or Childe Harold, or Christabel, or the Lyrical Ballads, or the Lady of the Lake, or the Waverley novels. All are sui generis; and the next great poem or work, now engendering in the womb of time, when it bursts upon the world, will probably be found as widely different from all these as they are from each other. Neither have the spiritual emanations of those who indeed possessed the “faculty divine,” ever been successfully imitated. Some, indeed, tempted by the dashing, off-hand, animated descriptions of Scott, and by the facilities for composition which his style afforded, have adventured into the lists, and sung of tilts and tournaments and gatherings and forays and onslaughts—but it would not do. Like all imitators, they had caught the points, the peculiarities, the striking phrases, or particular modes of expression—in short, the mechanical tricks of the thing; but the superior and characteristic touches, which impart life and reality to the whole, were not to be learnt. The soul was wanting; and the contests of their plumed knights and mailed warriors were like those of so many automatons worked by very palpable and ill-conditioned machinery. In fact, but for good Sir Walter, the present race of English and Scotch would have known but little of their doughty forefathers, or of the times when it was no derogation for a baron to pilfer bullocks, or gentlemen of unblemished integrity to go a sheep-stealing. He has illuminated history, and made that knowledge as “broad and general as the casing air,” which was formerly “cabin'd, cribb'd, confined” in the dusky closet of the antiquary. And what a charm has he spread over these larcenious periods! With what unscrupulous earnestness and self-approving consciences do his heroes appropriate their neighbors' goods and chattels to their own individual uses and comforts! There is no whining, or sentiment, or petty attempts at self-justification; they are the men of the times, as they then thought and spoke and acted; and as different as may be from all other delicate freebooters from Conrad the Corsair down to Paul Clifford, who, as has been wittily observed, “have every virtue under heaven excepting common honesty;” and we pardon their moral obliquities the more readily, seeing that they do not insult us by any pretensions to ultra-refinement at the time they are picking their neighbors' pockets. But if they lack the high polish and glitter of sentiment which adorn the superfine rascals of the Bulwer school, they have all some redeeming qualities to recommend them, which possess, at the same time, the slight merit of not being totally at variance with their actions and character—glimpses of rude but honorable feeling which make us love the rogues. Witness, for example, the graphic sketch of that most accomplished appropriator, “Sir Walter of Deloraine, good at need,” and his lament over his fallen enemy. How felicitously are we occasionally let into the springs of action of the men, and the manners of the age, by a single phrase—Sir William never shed blood “except, as was meet, for deadly feud.” These few words present us at once with a clearer and more distinct picture of the matter-of-course ferocity of the times than could have been drawn in pages by an inferior hand. Scott has become as deservedly celebrated for his battle pieces as Wouvermans. They possess all the freedom, force, and energy of that great master; while the irregular structure of his metre, owning or submitting to no check but the ear, is singularly well adapted to portray the varied fortunes of a changeful fight. Some may have equalled him in depicting “battle's magnificently stern array:” some may have surpassed him in painting the wreck and desolation war leaves in its track; but for the fight itself—for placing vividly before you all the alternations between defeat and victory in a hard fought field—for hurrying the reader breathlessly along with the current of events, so that he fancies himself a spectator of, almost an actor in the scene, and feels a personal interest in the fate of the several combatants—for seizing instinctively on the strongest and most picturesque points of the combat—for placing fair in view the wheeling, advancing, and retreating of the several squadrons and bodies of troops—the dread closing and deadly strife of the mortal foes—the charge, the rally, the rout, the flight, and the pursuit—in all of these Scott has never been approached. Verily his muse had no sinecure when his spirit was once fairly up in arms, and he sung of Flodden Field or Bannockburn. It is curious and interesting to observe the marked difference between the master minds of Scott and Byron, when employed upon a similar subject—the advance of soldiers to the field of battle— “Ere yet the bands met Marmion's eye, Fitz-Eustace shouted loud and high— Hark! hark! my lord, an English drum! And see, ascending squadrons come Between Tweed's river and the hill, Foot, horse, and eannon:—hap what hap, My basnet to a 'prentice cap, Lord Surry's o'er the Till! Yet more! yet more!—how fair arrayed They file from out the hawthorn shade, And sweep so gallant hy! With all their banners bravely spread, And all their armor flashing high, Saint George might waken from the dead, To see fair England's banners fly.”' What a fine contrast to this most animating description are the following surprisingly beautiful lines of Byron. They come full and round upon the ear, like the distant and solemn tones of the organ after the shrill and spirit-stirring clangor of the trumpet— “And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves, Dewy with nature's tear-drops, as they pass, Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves, Over the unreturning brave—alas! Ere evening to be trodden like the grass Which now beneath them, but above shall grow In its neat verdure, when this fiery mass Of living valor, rolling on the foe, And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.” VOL. II. 22 But Scott's claims to admiration rest not, even in a principal degree, on fiery description or impetuous narrative. His sketches of scenery have a truth and vividness, and, above all, a healthy cheerfulness about them, that is especially delightful, and which ought to annihilate (by contrast) at once and for ever, the morbid, bilious, and dyspeptic school of poetry, of which Byron is most falsely assumed to be the head and founder; as if the grand and melancholy solemnity of his strains had any thing in common with the puling complaints and sickly fancies of those who obscure the sun, and divest nature of her glory, because they happen to be troubled with debt or indigestion; or because their lady-love may have judiciously responded in the negative to their connubial overtures. Here is one of a hundred similar pictures— “The summer dawn's reflected hue To purple changed Loch Katrine blue; Mildly and soft the western breeze Just kissed the lake, just stirred the trees; And the pleased lake, like maiden eoy, Trembled, but dimpled not for joy; The mountain shadows on her breast Were neither broken nor at rest; In bright uncertainty they lie Like future joys to Fancy's eye, The water-lily to the light Her chalice reared of silver bright; The doe awoke, and to the lawn, Begemmed with dew-drops led her fawn; The gray mist left the mountain side, The torrent showed its glistening pride; Invisible in flecked sky, The lark sent down her revelry; The blackbird and the speckled thrush Good-morrow gave from brake and bush; In answer cooed the cushat dove, Her notes of peace and rest and love.” There are few things more agreeable than to peruse passages similar to this in Scott, after reading some of Moore's rich and luxurious descriptions of Persian scenery. Both are true poets—both delightful in their way—but the effect caused by their different manner of handling nature, is something like walking from a highly perfumed chamber into the pure air of heaven, impregnated with the fainter but more healthful odor of the thousand common wild-flowers that are for ever mingling their essences with its freshening currents. In creative power, too—in the formation and delineation of character, (judging him by his poems alone,) Scott is perfectly wonderful; and in this essential attribute of genius, double-distances all his contemporaries. The excellence of his poetical compositions in this particular, was acknowledged at the time of their appearance; but he has since rendered the world rather oblivious on this point by his splendid series of creations and resuscitations in the Waverley novels. The Waverley novels! What a host of pleasurable recollections throng upon the mind at the mere mention of their name! It would be folly here to attempt to enter upon their merits. The analysis of a single romance would, of itself, suffice for the covering of many pages; but when the mind glances in rapid succession from Waverley to Guy Mannering—from Guy Mannering to the Antiquary—thence to Rob Roy, Old Mortality, Ivanhoe, Kenilworth, and the long succeeding trail of glories, it is perfectly astounded at the immensity of intellect therein displayed. Fielding, Smollett, Richardson, Laurence Sterne, Godwin, hide their diminished heads; and as for the present race of novelists—what the middling or indifferent amongst them may fancy is not easily to be imagined, (for there is no limit to ignorant vanity,) but surely the best would feel sorrowful and ashamed to see their claims, for a moment, irreverently placed in comparison with those of Walter Scott. Long after their effusions have been literary curiosities, the Waverley novels will be regarded as the grand portrait gallery into which the successive generations who tread upon our graves will look for the kings, queens, courtiers, knights, chieftains, and freebooters proper to the times of old! and when the exact sciences have perfected a more systematic, methodical, and, it may be, more decent and respectable state of existence, they will remain almost the only records of a bloder, stormier, and more picturesque state of society that has gradually faded away into the dim and misty past. It is not anticipating too high a destiny for them to say that they will bring a tear to the eye, and the smile to the cheek, and infuse the germs of knowledge and feeling into the minds of millions and millions yet unborn. How many sick-beds will they cheer! and what stores of innocent pleasure and quiet enjoyment will be gleaned from their pages throughout the far-stretching future! This is to have lived. This is fame, to which that of the mightiest conqueror that ever reigned and destroyed is but a drop of water to the illimitable ocean; and this fame is Walter Scott's. “Harp of the north! farewell!” THE END.</field>
