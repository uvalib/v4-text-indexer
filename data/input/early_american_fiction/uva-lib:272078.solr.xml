      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER I. The battle was over. The wreathed smoke turned into blue air, and the polluted wave heaved smoothly after the uproar, as if purified by the very blood that had been poured into it. The French and British commanders lay side by side, on the deck of the conquerour, sheltered from the sun by an awning of shattered ensigns. Each was wrapped in a sheet, which was soon stiff and stark with the ebbing blood. The Frenchman was a being as full of chivalry as ever trod the deck of a ship. He was literally hacked and hewed, limb from limb. He had headed the boarders and carried all before him—was a conquerour, as he thought, upon the deck of the Briton, when he saw his own colours plucked down, before his eyes! The sight drove him mad. He lost his self-possession, and was driven back by a rank of whirling sabres, until he fell, overpowered, not subdued, just as he laid his hand upon the line, for the purpose of pulling down the flag of his conquerour. The Briton lay by him—a rude, rough sailor; but pluck and sinew to the back bone—a man that fought from a mere sense of loyalty, a feeling of constitutional bravery. The features of both were discoloured by the blood and smoke and powder. The Frenchman died first, and stretched himself out, with a convulsive shivering, which was involuntary, and a majestick countenance, as if to receive the honours of sepulture on the spot. The Englishman—he merely folded his arms, shut his eyes—turned away his face from the spectacle of slaughter, and died as he had lived, without emotion, or terrour, or convulsion, like a strong man going to sleep at will. Not a dry eye was about them. The strife, the mortal strife was over: and men that had met, but a few moments before, with flashing looks, and arms red to the elbow in smoking gore, were now wiping their eyes. The prisoners were brought on board, and disposed of, with a sort of indifference—so much as a matter of course, that served very sensibly to mortify them. There was no intentional unkindness in this. It was merely the habit of British sailors; and they went about clearing and scouring the decks, repairing the sails, and plugging the shot holes, with the same careless countenances. It was only now and then, when some shipmate passed, who perhaps had not been seen since the battle began, that they would betray any emotion—but then! their eyes would shine, and they would wring each others' hands, generally in silence, but sometimes with an oath that came from the very bottom of their hearts—swearing their gratitude to heaven! New passengers now appeared upon deck—some that had been below, from the first hour of Harold's arrival. He was the object of general attention. He was delirious, and by the indulgence of the first officer, after the decks were cleared, was permitted to remain above; under the same awning with the slaughtered rival. A beautiful boy was wailing aloud at his side, and a female, with a sweet interesting countenance, was sitting by him with such a hallowed, mournful, yet appalling abstraction of spirit, that no human being had the heart to approach or disturb her. If any of God's creatures were inconsolable—If any had no hope, here or hereafter, in their desolation and apathy, that woman, young and lovely as she was, might have been taken for one of them. Her pale thin hand was almost transparent, as she pressed 1—* it upon Harold's forehead—and at every throb of his temples, her blue veins would change colour, and deepen with the volocity of their current. The tears flowed slowly, so slowly, that they were hardly tears, but rather the humidity of a grotto, water oozing from the insensible stone, filtering through it, and hardening while you gazed upon it. In one word, she was a desolate and heartbroken creature. A rough sailor approached,—with the kindest intention—but her eyes streamed with sudden fire, like those of the famished lioness, when you attempt to bereave her of her whelps; and he retreated in dismay. A lady came and sat by her—took her hand. It trembled—her eyes filled faster: “Your husband, dear lady,” said the stranger—“my husband!” said the mourner, in a faint voice—“Oh no!—no!—but the preserver of my child.” Night came on; and the great ships lay in the moonlight, side by side, like two gigantic creatures of the ocean, wearied and slumbering, after a mortal combat. Thus lay Harold. It was the third day before he recollected aught that occurred; and the first words which recalled him, were in that peculiar tone of authority which had haunted him perpetually of late. His heart swelled. All that have fought together, are acquainted. There is no fellowship so distinct, so lasting, as that of danger. We are glad to meet a man, who has with ourselves, survived a shipwreck. In a strange place, we greet, with cordiality, one whom we have passed, and will pass again, a thousand times at home, without speaking to him,—all this is odd—but not so odd, as is the sensation, that men, whose elbows have touched and thrilled at the same moment, at the same volley, feel when they encounter, after the danger is passed. They have been seen embracing, after a battle, who had never met before in their lives, merely because they fought in the same uniform. Poor Harold's impatience of restraint became greater and greater, every hour. His situation was especially irksome; but the orders of his surgeon were peremptory, and when they stripped him, and found him scarred and wounded all over, they determined not to hazard one of such experience, in any precipitate operations. Leopold was forever in his arms. He slept with him, watched by him, mute as the statue of a blind Cupid, with his little finger on his lip, when Harold slept, and full of playfulness and frolick, when he awoke. The stranger too, he learnt afterwards, had been seen to look at him with feeling, until his eyes filled,—undoubtedly with delight, at the recollection of his own agency in his preservation. It was not so. It was a resemblance. Harold was anxious to find out more of the stranger, and of the woman, Leopold's mother. But he could hear nothing satisfactory. The former had never come upon deck, except in the evening: and the latter had been ill ever since she came on board, and was alarmingly so now. But the conduct of the stranger, during the battle, was the theme of universal applause.— The moment that the first gun was fired, he took his station by the helmsman, his countenance settled, and awfully pale. He stood, and spoke as if then, and not till then, he was in his own proper element—battle and smoke. He directed every thing with the precision of consummate experience, and the promptitude of one, whose very thoughts are actions. With his own hand, it was said, that he had cut down several of the foe, and that he had evinced such terrifick address all the while, particularly in the use of his sword, that they who had spoken of him, and been, as they thought, familiar with him before, were unable to open their lips, while he was near, nor even when he spoke to them. Who was he? they all asked—but all kept aloof, as from one whose presence was not lightly to be trespassed upon, and nobody could tell. That he had authority and experience was evident, but how far they went, was not now to be told, for he who had paid him the most signal deference, the Captain, was now in his winding sheet, and had never betrayed the mysterious trust. All his officers had remarked that the stranger was the only human being, before whom they had ever seen the Captain stand bare headed, upon the deck of his own ship. Bolton too, it appears, under the controul of the stranger, had fought with invincible resolution and effect: but Bolton was as ignorant of his name, and history, and character, as the rest. There was no being intimate with such a man. Harold was constantly occupied with an unaccountable anxiety about him, and this had arrived at that pitch, at last, that he determined to address him particularly, when he had a chance, and ask him in so many words, who and what he was! and by what mysterious power he held such dominion over the minds of men. One morning, while occupied with his purpose, he heard a noise on deck; the sound of a loud voice. The drum beat to quarters—and the ship was apparently clearing again for action. Harold was helpless. He called again and again, but nobody minded him now. The sick were abandoned. But was it morning? was it day, or night? The candles were burning dimly about: and the air blew freshly down the companion way. There was something cold and uncomfortable, but yet very grateful in it. Anon the windlass rung! voices were heard coming over the ship's side—the splash of oars.—A gun!— another! and another! “Hourra!” cried a wounded officer, “we are in port!” “In port,” said Harold. “Aye—is not that a salute? why, man, you have been asleep the last fortnight, yard arm and yard arm.” The stranger appeared for a moment,—his voice was particularly solemn. “Man the long boat:—arm the gig—bring up the prisoners,” were successive orders. The clank of fetters was soon heard—the dragging of chains, and the heavy foot-fall of strong men, in bondage. “Merciful heaven!” cried Harold—“can these be prisoners of war?” His companion stared at him a few moments without opening his mouth, and then added—“They are Pirates.” “Pirates!” echoed Harold—shuddering. He had been taught to believe a Pirate, what he is, the most damnable and dastardly of all the ruffians under heaven, preying upon the defenceless, despoiling him, the poor sailor, whose little pittance is literally wrenched from the elements, at the constant peril of his life: a man that riots in the blood and brains of his fellow men, yes, of the widow and the orphan, and that too, upon the awful solitude of the great deep, with the everlasting God all about him—and no human creature near—no hiding place—no city of refuge, no sanctuary—none! O! of what stuff must his heart be made, who can go out, under the boundless heaven, where there is no eye to pity, and no arm to save, and bear down, in thunder and lightning, with blood-red banners, upon the unarmed and unresisting—hewing and hewing them joint from joint, the husband and the wife, old and young, the mother and the babe! Harold saw them executed. Only one was spared. They were successively drawn up, to the yard arm, and then let down part way, with a sudden jerk, which caused the dislocation of their necks, like the report of a pistol. Harold's blood curdled—his heart turned sick, cold, cold as ice; and a clammy dew gathered on it. He could feel it gathering, like the distillation of a charnel house. “I cannot bear this,” said Harold, as they run a poor fellow up like lightning—a brief struggle, a quick cry, and a loud crack followed! There is such a horrible levity in it—in the open sunshine, all the business of life going forward under his eyes “and yet, perhaps, it is best,” said the stranger. Harold heard his voice and turned immediately to look upon his face. It was shaded with his hand. “Men ought to know that all the business of life can go on without them.” Harold laid his hand upon his—“do you know” said he, “that I feel at this moment, precisely, as if I were a witness against these men—as if I had stood by and seen their souls, arraigned, affrighted, naked, shivering and convulsed, before the judgment seat of God himself. I do indeed. I cannot breathe with the thought. A moment ago they were here—here! where I am, in life and health—and now! O, may He be merciful to them! Now they have received judgment! There is the body quivering yet! but the soul—where is that!” “Do you feel thus,” said the stranger, “Young man I venerate you for it.” “And what think you of the reprieve?”—said he in continuation. “I like that. I love mercy. I could kneel down and thank them for sparing one life. And the very sailors—see how they are affected by it! The populace too, in the boats—they are crying.” “No. You are deceived. You must learn to think. That reprieve was injudicious. Punishment should be certain. Certainty does more than quantity, in penal codes, to counterbalance temptation. Were there but one man in a million pardoned, every criminal would hope that himself would be that man. Each expects the prize in a lottery. No! these people are not weeping. They are disturbed because they are disappointed. The multitude will run abroad at the alarm of fire, and venture their necks to extinguish it; but let it prove a false alarm, and they are angry. They love sensation—they love spectacles.” “Sophistry!” said Harold smiling. “Would you say that a mother, who should hear that her child was burnt to death, run to the spot and find it false; would you say that she was angry because it was false? or because she had been cruelly, and unnecessarily alarmed.” “No, young man, your argument is ingenious. But I speak truth. The populace will assemble to execute a felon to day, with their own hands, and to morrow beset the throne of justice for his pardon. I have seen this, again and again. I have seen ten thousand people in tears because a handsome boy was to be executed; and I have seen the officer who brought his pardon, hooted and pelted from the ground, by a part of the same mob. Men sometimes sit down to cry—and it is dangerous to disappoint them. They have made up their minds to be sentimental, and woe to him who interferes or interrupts them.” “I am not fond of arguing now; Mr. Bolton has made me sick of it. It is unamiable and of evil tendency. He who disputes, hardly ever attempts to storm his enemy's entrenchments, without first abandoning his own. He cannot assail the defences of his antagonists, but by first leaving himself defenceless. Argument, like the sword and the battle-axe, should be left for great occasions; neither is an instrument for the fire-side.” “I was once of a temper like his (looking towards Bolton.) I was perpetually in a dispute; I was called evil tempered, because I called myself so, and people delighted to repeat it. I had my own purposes to answer by saying so—for I was weak—and ruffians were only to be intimidated, by learning that I was inplacable and unrelenting. But I am not. Young man, I take an interest in you, and therefore I will speak freely to you, more freely than I have for years, to any body. What I know of you, pleases me; perhaps, because it appears to me that I was like you, at your age. “I have seen the time Sir, when I could convince any man of any thing, if I would take the trouble. Because, no matter what I said, or how quickly, or on what emergency it was said, it was never unpremeditated.” Harold smiled at the recollection of her sagacity, whose remarks he had overheard. “No,” he continued, “what I said, however it appeared, and I was willing that it should appear hasty, had been deliberately considered before. You just expressed some pleasure at this reprieve. I was sorry for it; hear my reasons; and be accustomed to thinking boldly for yourself. Trust to no man's authority. There are several things to condemn in this affair. In the first place, all the pirates are represented as penitent, and assured of heaven. In the next place, he who is pardoned is kept in ignorance of it, till the last moment.” “Allow me,” said Harold.—“Is not its effect the greater:—will not the criminal only, but the populace remember it, with greater seriousness. He has suffered all but death:—the ignominy, the anticipation, the horrour, and the pain of such a death is nothing, absolutely nothing. I am sure of that, for I felt relieved when their necks snapped. I expected something a thousand times more horrible—but how instantly they were motionless! Oh, there is no death so easy!” “Right, young man, hence the glaring impolicy of such executions; hence too the frequency of suicide by hanging. Poor wretches! they see that the pain is momentary; all feel as you did, at the sight of the first execution. They expect to fall down, when the signal is given, and yet they find that the reality is nothing to the terrours of their own imagination. But let me proceed. By delaying the reprieve until the last moment, for a presumptuous and idle piece of dramatick effect—they teach every man, at the gallows, to expect, even to the last moment, the very last, a reprieve. “Gracious God!” cried Harold.—“Hence, every man goes out of the world unprepared, in reality!” “Yes—and hence too, the hardihood and carelessness, with which the most detestable ruffians go out of it; depriving the scene of all its terrours, making it a brutal farce, a trial of insensibility.” “You are right. But why do you condemn their penitence?” “I do not, when it is penitence. But how likely to be affected—and how unlikely to be sincere. They do not expect, or rather they are not certain of death, and therefore they are not truly penitent. They are too much agitated by hope and fear to become so.” “Listen to me. Our system of punishment, reprieve, and penitence, produces in every villain's heart just this process of reasoning:— “I will indulge my mortal appetite for blood—because at the worst, if I cannot escape suspicion—cannot bribe the witnesses, nor the jury—and if my lawyer cannot get me clear by his wicked eloquence, by some flaw in the proceedings—and if I cannot get a new trial— nor escape by subornation—nor break prison—nor bribe the gaoler—nor get a pardon—nor a reprieve—nor a commutation of punishment—nor get clear by some revolution, political or moral, why, at the worst I can repent, and go to heaven, at any rate, with the whole publick opinion in my favour, and the passport of many a pious clergyman in my behalf; nay, who knows? I may have a procession, a monument, an epitaph, be interred in consecrated ground, and pass for a martyr, a martyr to what! to the inexorable cruelty of my country's laws.—A pretty way to have those laws respected! a most effectual antidote to temptation, and profligacy, indeed!” “No sir—Harold, if you will allow me to call you so—” “Do, I entreat you, I prefer it. And what shall I call you?” The stranger was completely caught. He smiled faintly—but then, while his dark eyes penetrated Harold's very heart, and shot like dim lightning into it, till he was fain to drop his eyelids—a thing that he never did before, even in gazing at the meridian sun,— he laid his hand upon Harold's shoulder. “Young man,” said he, “have you any design in this?” “Yes,” answered Harold intrepidly. “Ha!” said the stranger, frowning, and compressing his lips,—“what may it be?” “To know who, and what you are?” “What!—and you have the audacity—but stay: are you employed?” “Employed!”—said Harold, scornfully, and starting upon his feet, “employed! No!” “And you ask only for your own gratification?” “I do.” “You shall be gratified. You are the first man that has been so for many years. At the sword's point, at the cannon's mouth, on the rack, at the stake, I have been asked that question. It has never been answered. Give me your hand. I am constrained to tell you, and I do so, without any promise of secrecy. My name is Oscar—I am— “Oscar!” echoed Harold wildly, “Oscar! surely I have heard that name before.”— “I am an Englishman—of the— Vol. II. 2 “O, I care not who, or what thou art! Thy name is Oscar; that name is enough for me. I love that name. I know not why nor wherefore, but it is very dear to me—somehow or other, connected with my dreaming, or my happiest moments. Well, well, henceforth I will call thee, Oscar”— “No—never—except when we are together, and alone.” Harold assented, and Oscar continued. “No, Harold, all this paraphernalia is absurd. The dying man should not be seen to die. Imagination is abundantly more powerful and terrifick in her indistinctness, than any reality. Let the body drop behind a black cloth, or into a box, and let us see nothing but the agitation of the rope, after our fellow creature is launched. Oh! what fearful pictures will be drawn then, of his convulsions, his spasms, his bursting blood vessels, his starting eyes, and swollen lips, his chattering teeth, with the bloody foam oozing from his nostrils, and his imprisoned hands, cracking and shivering in every joint! reaching, and straining at his throat!” “O, forbear! forbear, Oscar! This circumstantiality is so horrible, so unnatural!” “Therefore do I press it upon thee, Harold. I do the office of thine imagination, as if she were left to work for herself. But she is not. She sees that the victim does not suffer, and she lies idle, except as to the white cap, which she dare not lift up; and hence is it, that, of all the horrible preparations which accompany an execution, that of the white cap is the most distinctly awful to the multitude, and remembered the longest, spoken of too, with the most emphasis.” “Another defect is this; men are executed in day-light, and the mob go home, about their usual occupations. Before their head is upon their pillows, all their disquietude is gone, dissipated in the affairs of life. But let executions be conducted at night, by torch light, with tolling bells, at midnight, and what would be their sensations then!—permanent as life; and why? Because they would go to their chambers, with all the horrible reality ringing in their ears, swinging before their eyes all night long. To the villain, the night would appear interminable. To the good, it would bring ten-fold caution and distrust of themselves, and of every evil passion.” “No, Harold, No! I say it emphatically. There should be no pardon, no reprieves, no commutation. But if they must be, why let them be offered, at least one day, before the time of execution. Let this rule be inflexible. Have done with stage trick. Let a man know that death is inevitable; and he will be agitated, convulsed, and bowed down, if not with sorrow and contrition, at least with terrour and dismay, the advantage of which, to the publick, would be incalculable; while his present indifference is productive of the most alarming consequences. I have thought much on this subject, Harold, and could I live over again—(his voice faltered, and Harold thought that a more deadly paleness followed for a moment)—I might do some good yet.” His eyes were very wild as he said this, and a troubled expression passed athwart his high forehead. Harold listened to him with veneration and delight. His words were the words of wisdom. They were not to be gainsaid. Day after day, held they such conversations together, until Harold's mind began to feel about, and try her limbs in a new region. Harold never forgot his doctrines. On every subject there was something peculiar and uncommon in his manifestations; but the result was always satisfactory, and conclusive. Of many examples that occurred during Harold's brief acquaintance with him, it is in my power, to relate, pretty nearly in his own words, one or two more, just to show the peculiar energy and clearness of his conceptions. They were speaking of toleration in religious matters one day; and a man of great personal dignity and scholarship, whom they had often seen at his devotions, was announcing certain opinions with considerable emphasis. Nobody replied, until Bolton, first looking at Oscar, took up the gauntlet. “Sir,” said the clergyman (for so they found him to be) “this toleration is but another name for indifference. We find people abundantly tolerant in matters, about which they have no concern. Who is the most tolerant? The atheist. Who the next? The deist. The least so are those who are most deeply in earnest, right or wrong.” “My dear sir,” said Bolton, “I am astonished at this doctrine. It is reviving the faggot and rack. I should fear that, give it power, the same spirit would torture us, and burn us for heretics.” “O, no. We reason with heresy, we do not attempt to force. We would not.” “May not that be owing, Doctor, (the gentleman bowed) because you have not the power? Why do you use argument, persuasion?” “From a conviction that we are right,”— “And consequently, that all who differ from you, are wrong. Now, if you believe that to be right, is to go to heaven, and to be wrong, is to go to—I won't say where, how can you reconcile it to your consciences, not to use every engine, physical and moral force, and terrour, to make us right? I see my neighbour upon a precipice, am I to content myself with arguing and coaxing him away from it? certainly not. May I not pluck him away by main force? Surely then, if you do believe yourselves right, you may be justified in using physical force, to convert us, who think differently. Expostulatation is not enough.” “Surely,” said Harold,—“for what force is more irresistible than that of the mind? Is any influence so seductive—so dictatorial? That man is not free— cannot be—whose opinions are subjected to the argument of a stronger, and mightier, and better disciplined mind than his own. Therefore, you must, as Mr. Bolton says, either leave every man to find out his God, in his own way, with such assistance as that God hath given him, or you must permit any and every influence to be exerted—persuasion, terrour, and force.” The divine appeared staggered for a moment, not so much from the strength, as the unexpectedness of the attack. He had been too long arguing with people of his own persuasion, whom he found it mighty easy to convince: all his bulwarks and entrenchments were in ruin, and the enemy, a child, had broken in upon him, like an inundation, before he had time to rally his thought. He was silent, a good and great man, but one that disdained to talk, unless he were prepared. He cast an appealing eye to Oscar, who appeared to take a deep interest in the question. Oscar raised his head. “These are matters, young man,” said he, “upon which we ought not to speculate lightly. If they be touched at all, it should be, upon holy ground, with nakedness of feet, and heart. I tremble when I hear the young and rash, trespassing upon the mysterious confines of religion. There is one law for them. It is plain and beautiful. Do as you would be done by. It is the sum and substance of all religion. It is the perfection of wisdom and love. But, in seriousness, you are wrong. Your arguments, Harold, would be good, and would justify force, racks, and tortures, if force, and racks, and tortures could convert the mind.” “We may pluck a fellow citizen from the precipice by main force, because, our purpose is accomplished—we save him by force.” “But do we accomplish our purpose—or save him, by force, whom we torture to our creed? No—if we could—mark me—if we could so save a man's soul, so change his opinion—and if we were firmly persuaded that, unless he did change, he would be miserable forever, then it would be our duty to torture and burn him:— Just as it is our duty to save a creature in spite of himself, that rushes to the precipice, and gambols, heedlessly, upon the brink.” “But may we argue, and entice? Does not mental force transcend physical force, as much as the soul does the body?” said Harold. “Certainly, and intellectual superiority is tyrannical. We should be well assured therefore, at least of the purity of our intentions, when we attempt to influence others; but once assured of that, an earnestness in the attempt must ever be exactly in proportion to our belief in the exclusive superiority of our own creed. 2* “How benignant! how beautifully tranquil!” said Harold to Bolton, “every moment developing newer and higher qualities—growing wiser and older with the wise and the old; fighting every man with his own weapons; and that, not for victory, but truth; look at his countenance now! what sublime repose!” Harold felt an irresistible desire to prolong these discussions. This strife of words!—was it not a type of his own warfare in the wilderness—such coolness, collectedness, composure? The planted foot—planted against the whole world, as in despite—and never advancing, nor receding, but with a noble expression of fearlessness, as if sure that the new ground was familiar alike to him, and that every step, no matter which way it was taken, was one step toward the consummation of his purpose. On another occasion, they had passed a slave ship. It was in a hot latitude, and corpse after corpse was plunged into the warm blue water, as they lay a whole night within hail of her, utterly becalmed, in a moonlight, so holy, and so beautiful, that all the voices on board, even those of lamentation, sounded like prayer in the wind. There was one universal pause of horrour and affright, on board the ship, as something that floated past, was discovered to be the naked body of a black; it was bleeding all over from the assaults of innumerable little fish— the eyes were eaten out of their sockets. But while they were looking at it, and shuddering—a sharp ripple was seen approaching, and the next moment the body disappeared entirely—the water grew of a darker tinge, and the trunk soon after emerged, gushing with crimson!— There was a general cry of horrour, as if they had seen half of a living creature swallowed by a shark, and the other half palpitating on the water, as their sick hearts turned away in loathing. “Ten thousand curses on that vessel and her crew!” was the suppressed ejaculation of many; while others groaned aloud, and Oscar stood, with the sweat starting from his forehead, aud his hands clasped, and locked, and raised. He breathed aloud, as a sudden plunge announced the interment of another from the slave ship.—“O God! that I might open the batteries of this vessel upon her, and send them all, at this moment, before thy seat, for judgment!—the murdered and the murderers, face to face! the accuser and the accused—the accurser and the accursed! But—thy will be done!” A deeply interesting conversation followed, in which Oscar did not participate, except at intervals, until he was compelled, in a measure to it, by Harold. And when he did, it was in a manner, so profound and familiar, at the same time evincing such research, and boldness, that men, who would have trembled and shrunk from any other man that uttered the same snetiments, clung to him with unaffected sincerity and affection. “With the soldier,” said one, in speaking of him afterwards,” this extraordinary man has talked, till I have heard him claimed as an accomplished captain; with politicians, until I have seen them rise and embrace him—lost in wonder at the clearness and grandeur of his speculations, the unspeakable wisdom and foresight of his predictions. Yes, I have seen him claimed, at the same moment, on a bet, by four different professional men, each of whom was distinguished in his way. You may judge of his powers, and of their variety from that.” None liked him at first; none but him that could claim kindred with him, could endure his lofty, stern aspect, at times. In argument, he stood like some great captain at bay, sure of the result, beleaguered in his retirement, and permitting his enemies to exhaust themselves for his amusement; making a sally, now and then, before which, they were consumed and scattered, like dust in a whirlwind of fire. Who could remember, young as he was, when he had been conquered? where was the man that could say to him, on any subject, thus far shalt thou go, and no further! Often did he arise, like some high priest, for the sacrifice, and his words then were as the distinct, successive reverberations of thunder. His look was inspiration, terrible, and overpowering, not so much with the fire and splendour, as with weight and solemnity. Often was his a passionate eloquence, before which the wisdom of others became garrulity and infatuation. Those who listened, listened in thraldom, even when prepared for, and jealous of his power. There was such an air of earnestness, assurance, self conviction, such a total disregard of all trick and preparation—he was so plain, direct, and intelligible, that every heart heaved as he approached, and discharged itself of all suspicion, and all panoply. On another occasion, while the matter of the slave ship was still the theme of general execration and horrour, Oscar turned slowly to one who had been holding forth, uninterrupted, for a long time, as if sure of sympathy and accordance on such a theme. “I like your warmth, my dear sir,” said he; “it argues an uncorrupted heart, but permit me to tell you that it is a proof of your inconsiderateness.” “You are talking of the laws of England (his opponent was a lawyer) I have listened to you with great pleasure. But you are mistaken. The laws of England do justify slavery. You are startled—you wonder at my presumption. Hearken a moment, and I will convince you that you have too hastily repeated the language, and not the doctrine of Westminster Hall. Nay, more, the Doctor there, has spoken a good deal, for which I acknowledge myself deeply indebted to him, on the conformation and colour of the blacks—and our good friend, the clergyman has contended, erroneously I think, that this accursed practice is interdicted by heaven. My friends, I have but little to say. But I will undertake to prove this proposition: namely, that slavery, as it exists, in the British colonies, (for it is of them that you are speaking) is justified, first, by scripture, next by analogy through all the dependencies of nature; and thirdly, by the history of all nations; and fourthly, Sir, for your sake, by the laws of England—and by all laws human and divine.” “One word, however, on another subject, before I begin. These opinions of mine have been formed under peculiar and trying circumstances, and I forewarn you all, that, notwithstanding your unwillingness to agree with me, and all your prejudices against me, that I shall certainly convince you of some things that you now deem impossible.” “You smile, gentlemen. I do not wonder at it; but I have convinced myself, and I have always found that more difficult than to convince another. I know myself. You do not know me. You cannot. Yor underrated me once, when we first encountered—I speak to you Mr. Bolton; I crossed and thwarted you all, I fear, in wantonness. I am sorry for it. Now you overrate me— It is always so with the world; while one is poor, he is rated lower than he deserves; when he becomes rich, he is rated higher. So with talent; the unknown are underrated—the known and eminent overrated. The world love the marvellous, and the uncommon is their aliment.” “But sir,” (addressing an old man) “you are a statesman, an Englishman, a friend of the black man. So am I. It is our duty to follow truth, wherever it shall lead us, to discharge our hearts of all prejudice: and if we would do the African justice, to be wary and circumspect against his enemies. Follow me—watch me—beware of yourself and me.” “What is slavery? Are we to depend upon the definition of men that make books? That is one thing—but the slavery that is, is a qualified servitude, not moral nor intellectual, involving neither life nor limb. “But, say the lawyers,—Aristotle (for he was a lawyer then) Grotius, Puffendorf, et id genus omnes, Slavery is absolute. That is, they give a definition of it, and then prove that it cannot exist! Say they, no man can give up his moral freedom. The laws of God are paramount to all others. No man can give to another the right to make him violate the laws of God. But this is nonsense. It is reasoning in a circle. Man cannot be a slave because he cannot give up his moral liberty: and he cannot give up his moral liberty, because he cannot be a slave.” “All the arguments of these great men only go to prove that no such thing as a slave can be, in any way, right or wrong. But such a thing is, nevertheless. The fault then, must be in their definition. Take my definition— a slave is one held to perpetual servitude, having no right of property—whose posterity are slaves. Now this is the condition which I am to prove is justified by all law, human and divine.” “Slavery, say the lawyers too, can be in three ways only: first, by war—secondly, by purchase—thirdly by birth. “But,” say they too, in neither of these ways can one become a slave! Not by war; for the only right you have over your enemy's life (as if the master must necessarily hold the life of his slave at his mercy) is for your own safety. The moment then, that you forbear to kill him in battle, that minute you prove that his death is not necessary to your life, and consequently your right over him ceases!—Not by purchase, say they—because the property of the slave is the property of the master—and consequently, the moment that the money is paid into the hands of the slave, the bargain is complete, and slave and money are both belonging to the master. This cannot be a fair purchase, and therefore there can be no slavery by purchase:—None by inheritance—because, there being no way to make slaves of parents, there can be no such thing as slavery by birth! Sir, I appeal to you. Is not that the argument, ten thousand times repeated, of your greatest lawyers and civilians?” The lawyer bowed assent—and blushed. “Now, let us examine this, step by step. They grant me the right of killing my enemy in battle. Does not the greater involve the less? And who shall judge of this necessity? I, and I alone. If I may take his life, surely I may take his limbs; and surely, if I am willing to hazard the trial, I may venture to bind him, and bear him off; and if my right to kill him, arise from his being my enemy, I may slay him at home, and at leisure, on the first symptom of disobedience.” “No,” said the lawyer. “There is no compact.” “None express. I admit. But is there not one implied? Is it not for his benefit? And has not he, the power, if he find servitude worse than death, of escaping from it, at any time, by death. Besides, battle is a game. The parties play for profit. The prisoner is the property of his conqueror, all over the world; his slave emphatically. This is so, not only in Barbary, but all over Europe. Prisoners of war are made to work upon the fortifications; and are exchanged or delivered up, without ransom, only by especial treaties. Besides, they are chained and murdered, whenever the conqueror pleases. Witness Agincourt. Battle is a game; and its penalties must be paid. Having a right over the life of mine enemy, with nought but mine own discretion to regulate its exercise, I have a right to forbear, at any peril, to take his life; and a right to commute it, if I please, into perpetual servitude, to which his assent must be implied, because he has the power in his own hands of returning to the original agreement, when he pleases, and exchanging servitude for death.” 2d. “But he cannot be a slave by purchase! The reason, you have seen. But what is to prevent him from becoming a slave by purchase, if the money go to another, as a parent? Cannot a son ransom a father? Cannot a debtor sell himself for money, already received? “By war and purchase then, slavery may arise, and consequently it may, for ought that we see, by birth.” “But is there not a fourth way! Cannot a man forfeit his right to liberty by his crimes? surely he may. What are the jails, galleys, prison-ships, and courts of justice that we see, but proofs of this? Is not imprisonment slavery? Is it not an atonement, in servitude, to the offended law?” “But I disdain all this. I scorn to rely upon it. I have only argued thus, to show to what an enormous extent, the admission of the wisest and best men, will go, if vigorously pursued. Only grant to me the right of taking my enemy's life; and a slavery follows, infinitely more terrible than any we know, because a perpetual enmity will be between the conqueror and captive, and, of course, a perpetual power of life and death, in the former, over the latter. Grant to me the right of going to war, and letting myself, my limbs and life, out to hire, and it follows, of necessity, that I may stipulate with my master, by contract, that he may hew me to pieces when it shall please him. Grant me the right of legislatures to take away the life or limb of a subject, and I will prove, therefore, that he may dispose of both, just as he pleases” “But I rely on the whole doctrines of analogy, and law.” The company were here apparently confounded by the rapidity and suddenness of his combinations. They were endeavouring to follow him. “Man!” said the clergyman, “would that I could answer thee, but I cannot. There is an obliquity in thy vision, and thou seest things, not as thou shouldst, but as thou wouldst. All thy sublime faculties, for it is in vain to deny thy power—it is enough for us to resist it—are warped and perverted, by a diseased ambition. But go on! go on, thou dangerous man!” The stranger smiled, but resumed, in a melancholy tone, like one assured of his own resources, and confident of victory. “This is what I expected, my dear, sir; but have patience.” “Slaves are protected, in life and limb, in all countries; call them what you please, villains, bondmen, cerfs, helots, boors, peasants, or what not. If they are slain by their masters, the latter only escape, by their power; and that will protect any man, at any time, in the commission of any crime.” “But may a man bind himself to servitude for life? Oh no, say you of the long robe, He cannot. But you say falsely. Your equity courts will perhaps enjoin a specifick performance of such contracts, where the servant is an artizan, for instance; and your law courts do it effectually, by making the servant pay for a breach of contract, or, if he cannot, by sending him to prison, where he completes his term of slavery, if his master be so disposed.” “Are not all men slaves—servants—until they are twenty-one, in England; and twenty-five in France? Is there any reason why this minority should not be shortened or lengthened? Does not the law enforce this?” “Do not apprentices bind themselves for many years, and does not the law enforce their contract? What is a bankrupt but a slave to his creditor—does not the latter swallow up all his earnings, often and often?” “What is impressment? Our celebrated Habeas Corpus is useless there. Do not soldiers, sailors, nay, every officer of government and every individual, dispose of their liberty, in a more or less unqualified manner, as in marriage? and does not the law hold them to it? Is not even a clergyman a servant, bound by law, to the performance of his appointed servitude? So are your judges and your government at the universities.” “Thus we see that men may and do bind themselves, for months, years, nay, for their lives, under the sanction and authority of the law, and let the compensation go to their families, or to any third person.” “But can they divest themselves of the right to property? That, we know, is a distinctive badge of slavery.” “We say yes; why not? Does not the man, who involves himself in debt, do this? Is it not, in effect, abandoning the right to property, if, by no possible event, he can ever possess any—if it must all belong to his creditors. Do not men, daily, contract obligations, which leave them, thus, without any right to property? Or suppose that they have the right left. It is as useless, as it would be to the slave, who should be bound to pay his master 100,000 pounds, when he should have a right to all that he could afterwards get.” “A man may then, by contract bind himself to servitude for life; and divest himself, effectually, of all right to property.” “But may he bind his posterity? This seems a question of great difficulty at first. But where is the hardship? Is it not heaven's appointment? Are not the sins of the father visited upon the children? Do not the vices and disgraces of a father, as well as his virtues, descend to his children? Are not diseases hereditary? Is it not wise that they should be so? What can more effectually teach circumspection, to the dissolute and abandoned, than the knowledge that this is so? Does not the property of a parent descend to his children? and in Vol. II. 3 a measure, do not his obligations? In justice they ought. There would be no hardship in it.” The lawyer smiled—“But sir—this is only declamation—analogy—the law if you please.” “The law! sir, I should scorn to introduce it, on such an occasion, with all its absurdities, and nonsense, so technical and unintelligible, did you not drive me to it. But since you have, I will show you, sir, that the law supports it in principle.” “Have you studied the civil law? At first, you know, the child was obliged to answer the obligations of his father. This might be very wise, because it would teach that father circumspection, as in our doctrines of forfeiture, and attainder in high treason.—You are startled sir,—But I have not half done. After this, the heir was permitted to choose between taking the estate and paying the debts, or refusing it, and escaping. And finally, he was permitted, by indulgence, to wait until the value of the estate was known, before he chose.” “So much for the Roman law. Now for yours. What is your whole doctrine of warranty—lineal and collateral—but an entailed obligation upon a man's posterity? Nay, even upon his kindred? What your doctrines of inheritance? And what your doctrine of allegiance? Here I am peremptory, sir, and emphatick, because this contains the very principle, for which I contend. A man binds his posterity, forever and ever, by merely begetting them.” “By the divine and human law; the laws of Rome and England, a man may bind his posterity. Here are the three constituents of slavery! Are not the elements, I submit it to you, sir, are they not all found in the British constitution, and in the doctrines of British law?” The lawyer was astonished. But he had the manhood to admit it. “And now, sir, for you (to the clergyman), I have paid some attention to the bible, and I believe that I can give you authority, chapter and verse, from that, to justify slavery; and then, the practice of all nations.” “O, sir, not so fast,” said the clergyman, “the practice of all nations will prove nothing for you. There is no crime but may be so justified.” “I beg your pardon, sir. And I believe that you will find that there is no crime whatever, which all nations have united in being guilty of. Each nation has its own, I admit. But slavery is justified and practised by all nations, and unless war be another, there is no example of such unanimity in any criminal action.” “The bible—if you please, sir—the Hebrew,”—said the divine, a little nettled. “Well, the Jews made slaves, and they were God's chosen people. I remember many express regulations on the subject. A father might sell himself from poverty, 25 Lev. 39. He might sell his children, 21 Ex. 7. A thief was sold, when he could not pay his fine, 22. Ex. 3, 4. Creditors could seize and sell their insolvent debtors, or their children, 2 Kings, c. 4, v. 1. Prisoners of war could be sold. A Hebrew slave, ransomed from a gentile, might be sold. Hebrews were slaves to Hebrews for six years. “What more shall I say? The whole scriptures are full of ordinances and canons on the subject of slavery. Shall I look for analogy? Do we not find, through all creation, a perpetually diminishing gradation, order and dependence? through the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdom? Is not one man stronger and wiser than his neighbour? Is not dependence and servitude natural to the weak? Even in the cradle, you find distinctive attributes; Hercules and his brother were not more unlike than twins often are. Nature, God himself, through all his illimitable universe, has established different degrees of dependence. This qualified slavery is but one.” “On the whole then, you justify slavery,” said Harold, shuddering. “Yes—slavery, as I have defined it, and as it is. Do not mistake me. I do not justify the stealing slaves, or going to war, for the purpose of capturing human creatures. But I say this, that a man, as free as I am, at this hour, may bind himself and posterity to perpetual servitude; and abandon the right of property for himself and them, and thus make himself a slave, in the truest sense of the word, under the English law, if principles and analogy be followed.” This long, long discussion ended—the company separated for the night, but Harold heard some one, in passing him say, audibly, in his ear, “Beware of that man!” He turned—there was no one whom he could suspect, except the clergyman, and the old man. He went forthwith to Oscar, and told him what he had heard. Oscar pressed his hand. “The warning was friendly; regard it, Harold. Beware of me. I say the same. Indeed, indeed, Harold,” he added. in a melancholy, wild voice, while he laid Harold's hand to his heart,—“All is not right there Harold—no, nor here, (putting it to his forehead—Harold's teeth chattered—it was as cold as death!) I am afraid that I am not in my right senses.” Harold was so touched by the tone, in which this was said, that he burst into tears! “Oscar,” said he, tenderly—“would I could comfort thee—thou most extraordinary man! what can I do for thee?” “I know not—leave me. It were best for thee and me, Harold, that we never met again. Thy sympathy will be fatal to thee else. Leave me!” Harold gazed upon him in astonishment. A new expression floated athwart his pale countenance, like the shadow of spirits upon the water, at midnight,—when the moon shines. “Young man,” said Oscar, “beware! What the united opposition and enmity of the whole world hath failed to do, for whole years, thou hast done, by one simple ejaculation. Thou hast touched my heart. Its panoply is shivered. Its iron is dissolving. Its poison is diluted. In one word—I love thee, Harold, and there was a time when I never meant to say that to any human being. Harold, look at me. Thou canst form some notion of what I might have been, by what I am. But thou never canst entirely know, how wickedly and wantonly I have misapplied my power. At this moment, I feel the rebuke of thy youthful nature so overpowering to me, that mine grows unsteady, reels and repents before it.” “Repent!” cried Harold, “repent of what! of having silenced the old and the wise, taught wisdom to grey hairs, and borne all before thee, in the irresistible strength of thy coming and going!” “Yea, even of that, do I repent me Harold—even of that! I see in thee, the same unhallowed, regardless spirit. I implore thee, Harold, I adjure thee, dear Harold, as I would my brother, or my child, to strive with it,—wrestle with it, night and day; else wilt thou be, what I am, a dreaded and avoided man, repulsive and unsocial. Like me, thou art striving for any dominion, so it be absolute, for any: though compounded of hatred and distrust. Beware of it; it is a lying spirit. It will make thee (lowering his voice, and speaking in a tone that thrilled through and through the marrow of his proselyte) detested, shunned, abhorred!—none will love thee—none endure thee—beware!” Harold's arms, already reached to embrace the sublime creature, in his desolation, dropped powerless at his side, as if struck down by an invisible weapon, at the sound of his voice. He stood appalled, quaking. His spirit which, a moment before, was all up in arms with that of Oscar, as it stood and swayed the very senses of men, now tottered in his rebuke, like a child before the stern countenance of a giant. All this was inexplicable. The more he thought of it, the more mysterious and perplexing it became. Whence this sympathy, this awe? was Oscar unhappy? No. It could not be called unhappiness. It was something darker, loftier. There were times, when his keen, searching eye, appeared turning inward, and surveying some empire in ruins;—when a cold, discontented, but majestick shadowing of the brow would follow, and he would smile—ignorantly it might be, but his smile was the sarcastic levity of an enthroned spirit, looking down, with patient forbearance, upon the petty, and annoying calamities of life. It was the look of something wicked in its nature, restrained from the commission of evil, only by contempt for its littleness—withheld from revelling in the excess of consummate guilt and devastation, only because guilt was of such every-day occurrence. At times too, Harold had seen his countenance, by lamp light, instantaneously changed, as it were to a pale bronze; and over his high white forehead, he had seen the faint 3* crimson rush so suddenly, as to startle him—like the reflection of a red meteor, in passing, as if some unknown element, etherial as the hue of sunset, had been suddenly let loose in his bosom, and flashed, instantly, through all his extremities. And he had seen him too, when he turned deadly pale, while he was alone, and silent;—and then the waking up, the shifting of his wild and beautiful eye—the mournful and expressive tenderness, the immaterial, spiritual solemnity of his manner, as he strove to recover his collectedness, were wonderful things to the observation of poor Harold; things of inconceivable interest. Their attachment increased—they had been blown out of their course, and the passage had been, already, of an unprecedented length, and they now occupied the same state room; till, at last, Oscar appeared uneasy when they were not together. This was what Harold coveted. He wanted this study all to himself. So many noble, unearthly, heroick qualities were only given for the contemplative. The apparent sullenness and misanthropy of Oscar soon took their real shape and dimensions. It was wretchedness—wretchedness, so extreme, and hopeless, that Harold, yea, even Harold himself, who never wept at any corporeal agony of his own, absolutely sobbed as though his heart were breaking, as he saw Oscar, one night, when he awoke by chance, leaning backward in his birth, the whole live-long night, with his eyes shut, and the lamp shining in his face—his hands locked upon his bosom—and large drops of sweat standing upon his forehead and temples. His breathing was audible—like the beating of a heart oppressed to suffocation. Harold watched him, after this, night after night. He found that he never appeared to sleep. He was wasting away, in silence, as by some mortal poison, and Harold could see him fade, while he was talking with him. What kept him alive? he knew not. He ate not, drank not, and the rigid determination of his countenance, waxed, every hour, more steady, resolute, deadly and sublime. Thus many nights had passed, and poor Harold, who had but lately recovered from the agitated and passionate remembrance of his parting with Loena—would shiver now, as if an ague were upon him, from pure sympathy with the solitary and afflicted stranger. But this could not last forever. At midnight he was suddenly aroused. A cold hand lay upon his bosom. He awoke, and found little Leopold clinging to him, and gasping for breath. “Arise!” cried a voice, that he had never heard before. Harold's hair bristled. “Arise,” repeated the voice. He had heard it before! It was dark, awfully dark. The voice appeared to come from a great height above him. Where was he? It was the voice of a high wind. He endeavoured to recollect himself; but the horrours of superstition were upon him, and his joints rattled, as he shrunk backward from the cold hand, that still pressed upon him, with supernatural strength. For his soul, he could not articulate a sound. An unaccountable fear made his flesh creep. Was he awake? He was—for he felt poor little Leopold quaking under the clothes, as if he had been dislocated by some frightful apparition. A loud tread upon deck, and the changing of the tiller— and then the huge flapping of the main sheet, as if it were rent fore and aft, by the movement, followed the voice and shook Harold almost from his birth. A strong gleam of light shone down the steps, and through the sky lights, and rested upon an opening door opposite, where the lamps were expiring in blue smoke. “What—Ha!— what art thou?” cried Harold, and fell back, with a loud groan, into his birth. The cries of Leopold, half frantick with terrour, soon brought assistance. And who was that being—what was it—whence? It was Oscar, but so worn and ghastly, so frightfully altered, since Harold had seen him, in the morning, before he shut himself up in his room, that Harold could hardly believe his senses. He stood before him like a dead man—his hollow eyes and sunken temples—O! if ever death were preternaturally busy, it was then!—The dew of the sepulchre was upon his limbs. The veins on his livid forehead were full and swollen, and dark and agitated, like live worms—and when the pressure of his fingers was felt upon Harold's wrist, his pulse stopped!—the blood retreated, shivering, to his heart—and even that organ seemed to contract and hide itself with a mortal spasm at the touch. Oscar put his hand upon Harold's forehead—his very brain grew cold—and he shuddered, as he put it aside, almost with rudeness—“whence art thou to night? Art thou Oscar? Speak!” cried Harold, his teeth almost chattering with affright. “Arise!” cried the voice that he had heard twice before. Was it his? O, it could not be—it came from a far—far—place—the depth of the ocean, mayhap, or the hollow caverns of heaven.—But Harold obeyed, mechanically. They ascended to the deck. Lord! what a night it was! The whole firmament was embossed, with flowered silver—all over white and shining, with a profusion of gems, glittering prodigally about it, like powdered jewellery—seed pearls, thrown by handfuls over some magnificent white velvet tenting cloth. “Come hither,” said the same melancholy, distant voice—Harold looked whence the sounds issued, but the lips were motionless—“Come hither!” it repeated, drearily. They approached the stern of the vessel. “I have seen her!” said the voice. “Seen whom!” “Hush! hush!” it cried, “I have seen her. Lo!— there she rises! Look there upon her. “Dearest! I am coming.” O God what a voice! thought Harold, so sweet, so tender, so plaintive,—O, I would follow it to the depths of the ocean!—Harold looked where Oscar pointed, and saw, or fancied that he saw, afar off, a dim shadow, emerging, in the bright wake of the ship. Could it be possible—“great heaven, it is approaching!” cried Harold, gasping for breath. “Hush, hush!” said Oscar with increased solemnity— his eyes glistening dreadfully in the moonlight—“Hush, She is coming. Speak not, breathe not—or the charm is broken.” Harold shut his eyes. Oscar waved his arm. “There is thy ring, love, take it,” he said, in a low, disconsolate voice. “I will reclaim it, in thy bridal chamber, ere the moon hath set,—” plucking somewhat from his hand, and throwing into the water. “What, is it gone!” said Harold doubtfully, as he ventured to open his eyes. “Hush! boy—hush! or I will strangle thee on the spot,” whispered Oscar. But Harold could see nothing now. “She has descended for the ring!—There! there!—now look—she has it— she has it! how it glitters upon her pale finger!—Harold, give me thy hand—I cannot see thee—where art thou—farewell—I would look upon thee, would kiss thee once, ere we part forever, for I love thee—but—I cannot, dare not take my eyes from her face again. Farewell! I am going.—Twelve years ago, I lost her—by merely turning away my eyes—for twelve years I have hunted her—through earth—through air—through sky and ocean.—Farewell—be quick—be quick—This is the appointed hour—midnight—dearest! I cannot come till midnight is accomplished—thou knowest that.—It was here, Harold—one moment more—my heart beats time—It was here that I—I—I—slew her—here! in the middle of the ocean—and here we meet—dear creature!—broken heart, with broken heart—the ocean our sepulchre—our bridal chamber!—” Before Harold could put out his hand—Oscar's night dress brushed by him, and he saw him alight upon the water, at an amazing distance, astern. His first impulse was to follow him—but Leopold, with his head in his bosom, still clung distractedly about his neck—His next was—but it was too late, the vessel was sailing like a hawk through the heavens,—to call for assistance. He shrieked—but he could not make himself heard. His knees knocked together. At this moment, the vessel shifted her course, and in her glittering wake, just as the watch at the top cried out “a man overboard,” and all hands flew to put her about—he saw a something—could it be— he felt that he was cruelly disturbed—but indeed it appeared to him, as he rubbed his eyes, and gazed upon it, that there were two figures in the water, toiling and toiling together—nay, he was sure of it—for he distinctly saw two black spots—and then they seemed to approach, and stand up, upon the wave. He was gone—gone forever. They put about, and sent out their boats in all directions; and covered the sea with plank and casks and spars lashed with ropes, but the moon went down, darkly, and there was no hope left. Harold seemed rooted to the spot. He suffered the child to be taken from him, without knowing how, or by whom. He felt a fearful apprehension that he himself should die in some such terrible manner—in delirium. Was he not like Oscar? alike in every strong and terrible attribute?—every evil passion?—melancholy—peculiar? —loving and beloved?—to distraction—death!—with, and by a broken heart?—an outcast too—an abandoned one! “O God of my fathers!” he cried, in the agony of his spirit—take me also. O take me now, even now, in my unpreparedness—let me not live to be a madman! She is gone—she!—the unspeakably dear one. I feel her chamber in my heart, cold, cold, and desolate—untenanted—it is a sepulchre! Yea—she is gone. And O, I pray thee, let me be with her! The waters are rolling between us.—She is tempted, perhaps—and where am I?—She is weary and dying—and I am afar off!” For the first time, now, poor Harold began to feel, in its extremest latitude, the doubtfulness and apprehension of love. Hitherto, he had been assured and confident; and while he turned back, with a swelling heart, to the western horizon, and thought, in the deepest devotion of his spirit, with his hands trembling upon his bosom, of his dear Indian girl, the gentlest and kindest of human beings,—her, who would have laid down life for him, a thousand times over—the creature of heroick, but untried principle—and when he so turned, with these holy and uplifting thoughts, he was happy, even under the apprehension that she was—possibly, no more—or what was yet worse, possibly alienated from him!—But now, he was miserable—yea, the most miserable of God's creatures.—Why did he ever leave her! he asked himself a thousand and a thousand times.—Where was she? among strangers—and he!—upon the pathless water—shutting his eyes wilfully upon the only star that shone upon him in his desolation!—leaving it to go out—unthought of—like a neglected vestal fire, in the far heaven. How wild and visionary are our dreamings at such a season! How Memory, the wizard, delights to dwell upon, and aggravate all that we have lost; hallowing and touching out with a melancholy tenderness, every bright and beautiful spot, in our long journeying of the past, and concealing, with a gentle waywardness, which we, ourselves, while feeling the amiable deception practised upon us, have not the heart to resist!—every infirmity, every unlovely part, every unholy feature and expression; all are shrouded in twilight—hidden, like the secret ravages of death in the consumption, under colour and light, radiant eyes, and yet more radiant lips—and all that was endearing, affectionate, captivating, is recalled, with a bewitching regard to allurement, and more exquisitely tinted anew, with beauty and delicacy. The faded flowers are newly perfumed—the grave yard sprinkled anew, and frankincense burnt, amid musick, and prayer—and the faces of the dead are hidden, benignantly, that we may not be too much terrified with the awfulness of reality.—Emotions, long since forgotten, are set thrilling anew, like neglected harps—upon which, it is said, that the spirits of the departed love to repose their fingers, and breathe their melodious breath.—O what reveries come to us in these hours of enchantment! The great solitude of the heart is newly lighted up, and newly peopled—and musick and dancing are there!—as in a great city after a pestilence.—The spirits of them that died have their revelry and feasting, under the necromancy of that enchanter, Memory! Poor Harold! a new and impatient sense of confinement followed the deep revery of his heart. He panted to tread back the waters; and clasp his dear girl once more! only once more! to his heart; and then, if so it should please God, to abandon forever, all his fiery and fierce schemes of ambition, quench all his arrows that were stacked for dominion—and enter, hand in hand, the untrodden solitude of the grave—and there be with her —and alone—forever and ever! O if that might be— he had no other wish, nor prayer! His temples grew animate with the thought. His veins swelled, as if he were exciting all his mental energies to upheave some weight that threatened to overwhelm him. Nature could no longer endure it. He fainted—and slept. A delicious and shifting dream came to him, in his slumber, but all that he could remember, when he awoke, the following day, was, that his lips had once more thrilled to the touch of hers! his dear one's. There came a beautiful tranquillity and assurance in the thought. It seemed that he had revenged her, how, he knew not; but when away from all that we love, there will come such delicate insinuations of wrong, in the one, or the other part, and we become so tenderly solicitous to meet once more, and press the dear hand of our beloved, and reassure our hearts that we are forgiven. There was a melancholy oppression upon Harold, when he awoke. He could have covered his face and wept, in the mere lunacy of passionate tenderness; and yet, he was less unhappy than usual, notwithstanding the sudden and terrific death of Oscar. But he soon awoke more fully to a sense of his situation. The month, the season, nay the very day struck upon his recollection, like the knell of death. It had been nearly fatal to him once before; and this season had ever been peculiarly inauspicious. He trembled as the thought arose, with undefinable apprehension, like one approaching the scene of some early and distracting bereavement, some consecrated spot, where he wept and parted—perhaps forever, with the dear creature of his affection— the unspeakably beautiful and cherished one—some place, where he first heard the sorrowful annunciation of some calamity—no matter what. Who can approach the insensible things that were about us at such a moment—be it but a chair—a green turf seat—an old tree— nay though it be the brightest and greenest spot on earth, who can approach it, after years have passed a ay, without growing weaker in every joint,—without mournful, and sweet associations—attended, while his eyes are filling and his lips tingling, with some melancholy presentiment that all has not yet been done in the way of desolation and bereavement! Thus it is with time. We are naturally gifted with superstition. Whatever is mysterious, is preternatural in the philosophy of simple hearts. They love to imagine dependencies and associations where they are touched. And thus, an event, mournful or festive, happening to some gay reveller, under extraordinary circumstances, makes a lasting impression on him. The season comes round again, and he remembers it, with woe or jubilee, according to its character. His heart quakes or palpitates till the appointed day, week or month, or perhaps season, hath wholly past. On that day, he weeps and gives up his spirit to futurity: or falls to exploring, with bright eyes, and a confident step, the shadowy solitude of time and space. Perhaps, while he is thus occupied, another event, which at every other season had been disregarded, or forgotten, takes place, holding affinity in mournfulness or pleasure, with the first. If the former, his heart is wrung with ten-fold cruelty. The season becomes accursed, to him. He dreads its return—and feels that a portion of the blessed year, is under a blight; a part of the sun's path through a perpetual eclipse for him. Let the wisest deny it if he can? All men have their fortunate and unfortunate seasons of adventure; their preferences, partialities and antipathies, even to inanimate things. The wise are only so, in their choice of objects. Yea, we may say what we will; the sternest of us will truckle, and look about him, with a troubled and disconsolate air, as that day approaches, or that month, which has been successively calamitous to him. Yea!—and the soberest, will enter rather more confidently upon any undertaking, if it occur to him, at the time, that, in similar undertakings he has hitherto been successful, at similar seasons; for after all what is the difference,—seasons and places, become lucky or unlucky to him. What are our anniversaries—jubilees—festivals, but a tacit acknowledgment of this? I speak from neartfelt experience. In my boyhood, when I ran, barefooted over the wild mountain, heedless of aught but the flowering precipice, and the blue water, there was one month, one! in which I was first distinguished; Vol. II. 4 that month was ever after a festival to me: and there was another, in which I have been forever disappointed, broken down, and discomfited. And now, even in my old age, I feel a tenfold assurance, that whatever I can begin and conclude in that former month, will be happily concluded. In that month I was never disappointed, never visited by sorrow, or sickness, or mortification. Nay more—I am weary of the world, and I feel assured and certain that in that month, I shall die—and be happy. The wise will call this folly. It may be so—it may be too, that the very belief of failure or success may lead to it. It may be, that, in the season of flowers, if aught of an unpleasant aspect obtrude itself upon us, we persist in believing that there are goodness and beauty under its disguise: it may be that we thus perfect the delusion, by perpetual industry. And yet, all the reasoning and authority of experience cannot dislodge the tremendous belief that occupies my mind—that—if I should die in that month of sorrow and disappointment, I should die a death of horrour, unutterable horrour: but I shall not—I shall be gathered to my fathers, I am sure, in the blessed month. Would heaven that I might believe in the consolation of philosophy, at such a moment—but I cannot. To religion only, can I look—with her have I abided and found comfort. Thrice, in the listlessness of my heart, have I been torn and lacerated by the wantonness, or wickedness, or rashness of others—thrice—yea thrice, mortally wounded, where I had put my whole of happiness, here and hereafter, I fear, upon the casting of a die. Thrice have I been shipwrecked, in foam and wind— and lost my all. Thrice have I been brought down to the very dust, and prayed that I might no longer live. Cruelty and desolation beset me, like famished blood-hounds. But, my nature arose above it all. The same month, yea almost the same day, was the successive witness of my annual tribulation, for many years. But, it hath passed. I was made, by the great and good God, to be happy, and I have always felt that he would not be thwarted in his appointment. With thoughts like these crowding upon him, and his poor brain fevered under their importunity, Harold consumed hour after hour in panting, with a sort of sullen impatience, for the arrival of the ship to some land, he cared not where, so that he might tread firmly, once more upon the earth, and feel no longer the everlasting motion, heaving, and giddiness of the sea. While lying in this way, one afternoon, with a disposition guardedly contracting from all intercourse with others, he was startled by a hurried movement on deck— a prolonged cry—and a general rushing and trampling. He listened, and a musquet was fired just over his head. He raised himself up, and discovered, through the distant window, a sail. No great matter, one would think—but after an endless voyage, over the lonely and unfrequented solitudes of the ocean, every animate and inanimate thing is pleasant; every thing that reminds you of your relationship to other human beings. You are, as the survivors of the flood—not certain but that the dry land may have passed away since you left it; not certain, until you meet some other human being, like yourself, adrift upon the water, but that you are the wreck of a whole world. You may smile at this extravagance, but is it not, may it not be, the thought of the weary mariner? Yea, even of the philosopher? O! it is pleasant to find another creature coming toward you, with all her sails spread, as if she floated over the horizon, or emerged from the blue vapour of the firmament, if it be only to show you that you are not, as you believe, in the very centre, fixed and motionless, forever and ever, of the round ocean. For this is the belief of the senses, go as you will, on the wings of the wind—you have nought in heaven or earth to mark your progress: a perfect circle, beyond which, as if it were an enchanted one, it seems impossible to pass—you are forever in the centre! and the boundary flies from you, as you pursue it. A single sail, thus breaking out of the sky, like a great angel with his wings spread, comes to your weary and sick heart, like a celestial visitant; and brings home to it: with an emphasis, that few can withstand, and none who have not been at sea, can comprehend, all the beautiful, and tender, and comfortable recollections of home. Harold arose and went on deck. It was a calm; and the boats of the stranger were soon alongside, and the usual inquiries and compliments were interchanged. His return to the deck was hailed with triumphant acclamations. He had become, in spite of his reserved and haughty demeanor, which, in the world would have been mistaken (if he became distinguished) for a princely spirit of command, quite a favourite with every one whom he had thought fit to approach, in his kinder moments. Harold had a faculty, and one which never left him, of making whom he would, his friend, and whom he would, his mortal foe, almost without an effort. If he chose, there was no resisting his frank, cordial, vehement manner. Your blood would thrill as you listened. You would not only feel, as he felt, but look, as he looked. And, if he chose, there was in his deep toned melancholy, his inexpressible abstraction, a somewhat of the sullen and discontented, that, now and then, begat a correspondent disquietude in all about him. It was not ill humour, nor sulkiness. It was a sort of intellectual weighing; but it often looked like the closeted and moody bearing of a selfish and proud spirit, disdaining to be pleased. Perhaps it was so, at times: for there were times, when it seemed that he scorned to hold his happiness by any tenure common to his brethren; as if he had sworn, and concentrated all his energies to support the oath, to be dependent only on himself for enjoyment—careless of all other earthly things. And yet, how untrue were such appearances! They who least knew him could remember some proof of his disinterestedness—and that sacrifices, of the most painful and trying nature, for the good of others, were so familiar to him, as to appear a part of his occupation. All that he said was remembered; all that he did was forgotten. He said that he would not yield to others—that he could not weep—that he never forgot nor forgave an indignity—and that he would never consent to hold his happiness, by a tie so frail as the changeable opinion of the world. And yet, he did so hold it, and voluntarily exposed his choicest blessings to the seductiveness of fashion; and this, when it was neither sought for nor expected. And thus it was with Harold's temper. He, himself, spoke so suddenly and passionately, and his dark eyes flashed so portentously, and his nerves so vibrated, at times, that they, who could not recall a single instance of wickedness in action, still believed that he would act wickedly, on any befitting occasion. They overlooked the proof that he gave out incessantly, to the observing mind, that he resisted where others yielded, and yielded where others resisted, from a natural violence of temper. No man had seen him violent, where it was magnanimous not to be so; and many had seen him sorely beset. But they forgot his doings. They remembered only his sayings. They remembered that, where others were gracious and conciliatory, benignant, smiling and complaisant; they had seen his pale lip writhe in scorn—his brow contracted in wrath and detestation—his cheek and eye flaming; and hence, they very naturally concluded, that he who was so terrible on light occasions, would be tenfold more formidable on greater ones. But they wronged him, Harold's self-denial and forbearance rose with the occasion, and always overtopped it. It was his delight to do, what other men could not. When his heart was sweltering to suffocation, his forehead was unwrought—pale, very pale, but immoveable. Where others would be clamorous, he was always calm—so calm, that they who saw and heard him, would think him sick—sick unto death—they would never suspect that it was a mortal passion. Could it be, that such self-command should find no eye to discover it, no lip to bless it, no kind heart to applaud and encourage it! Yea!—and Harold passed before them that should have loved him for this very trait —them that he loved, throughout his whole life—as one not to be trusted with the happiness of others. Nay, such was their merciless infatuation, that he, even he, who had been the guardian of his own happiness through every peril, temptation and vicissitude, and had risen forever and ever, where other men had sunk, becoming better and wiser every hour, with the bitter and humbling *4 mortifications that beset him, and were poured upon him, with an unsparing hand, by those from whom he had a right to expect better things—even he was classed with the fluctuating and common. Alas for Harold! his was no uncommon fate. Many a heroic spirit is brought to judgment, and condemned, in the same way, unheard—undefended—with no dear one to plead to heaven, or to mourn for him, and no blessed hand to treasure up the good deeds of his day, and no proud heart to interpose, and array such deeds against his arraignment. “No, no, never!” cried Harold. “I never will stoop to defend myself. I will not remind them that ought to know me, of what I have done in their sight, and for them, to prove my nature. No! qui s'excuse, s'accuse. He who asks me to defend myself, has already found me guilty in his own mind. He might as well ask a woman if she be virtuous.” These reflections broke from his lips, occasionally, in rapid, but inarticulate exclamations. He was suddenly but kindly arrested, as he sat looking down into the water, by a hand put gently upon his shoulder. Harold started, trembled, blushed, and endeavoured fully to recover himself, before he looked up. What had he been saying? —his heart rose in his throat with shame and vexation— and he had half determined to rebuke the intruder, whoever it might be, sternly, for having trespassed upon the secret chamber of his soul; but he could not—for his soul he could not. The hand was still there. It was so warm, and indulgent—he felt it as if it were pressed upon his naked heart. He tried again to look up, but could not—it was impossible—he feared to disturb it— and merely as an excuse for not looking up, he said, carelessly, “what a delightful blue!” pointing to the water. No answer was returned. Who would have believed it! they, who affected to know Harold, would have looked to see him throw off the hand, in scorn and sarcasm, and smite the officious intruder to the earth—a faint sound, as of sorrow, was breathed over him—he placed his hand upon that which rested on his shoulder—it was a woman's! “Harold! wilt thou not look at me,” said the voice. He turned—he attempted to rise—he staggered and fell, his whole length upon the deck! Many hands were instantly busy about him; some tore open his waistcoat, and some chafed his temples. A tall female in black, leaned over him; her countenance deadly pale, wherever it appeared, in glimpses, through her torn veil, which he had snatched at and torn, as he fell, with a delirious laugh. She offered him no assistance—scarcely seemed to bewail him; but tear after tear fell upon the hand that she held locked in hers, under her veil, and her bosom heaved with the strength of convulsion, under her black velvet drapery. Harold soon recovered, but his eyelids were humbled to the earth—he stretched out his arms, and surrendered up his spirit, and bowed himself down, until his forehead touched the deck, before the severe and lofty presence before him. It was the attitude of worship—that of the most unequivocal, unqualified, and profound adoration. They that were about, were struck with consternation. They stood aloof in silence. “Harold—” said the female, with a deliberate emphasis, and without emotion—it was the voice of a judge about to pronounce some irrevocable doom. Harold locked his hands, and shook all over, with insupportable anguish. She trembled—tottered—a passenger ran to her assistance, but she waved him off haughtily. She took his hand. She said something in a low voice, at which he attempted to rise, caught her hand, and pressed it again and again, passionately to his lips. He arose. She put both of her hands into his— “Harold,” said she, in a tremulous tone, “my poor boy!” she withdrew her hand, and put it upon his forehead; “how wet and cold thy forehead is.” As that hand touched him, his knees bent again, and he would have fallen down again, had she not withheld him. “Harold,” said she, “be composed—be wary. We are among strangers. There is a long account between us; it must be settled. God hath brought us together. I will be with thee again.” “Nay, nay, thou blessed one! thou wronged and terrible woman! Do not leave me! Almighty God! O no! we shall never meet again. I cannot, cannot bear to see thee. But do not leave me! I will not survive it! Woman, woman! do not leave me! Behold me—here am I! do with me what thou wilt—here I am at thy feet. And wilt thou go? O woman, woman! canst thou leave me again!” “Madman,” was the reply; “where is thy discretion. I must silence thee.” She then bowed herself a little toward him, and he caught her hands again to his lips in transport, bowed in submission to her, and suffered her to depart, like some majestic phantom, unquestioned, unabused, in its royalty. Harold rushed to the cabin, threw himself upon the floor. “I thank thee, God of heaven! I thank thee,” he cried, “O Father of mercies I bless thee—she—the dearest—the best—my own, my own—horrour, mine!— O Loena, Loena.” He shuddered, arose, and staggered against the pannels of the birthing, as if he had been upon his knees—blaspheming, deliberately, Jehovah and his angles! His heart waxed damp and desolate. He remained a long time in a sort of stupor, and he recovered only at the sound of a female voice, when he found himself clinging to the dark dress of some one that stood before him, as if he were a drowning man. He opened his eyes, they were full. He tugged at the dress in silence, with a look of desperate and impassioned supplication. It was the beseeching of one who has only one hope—only one, on this side of heaven. “O do not, do not leave me, lady!” he cried, as the terrified woman appeared well nigh fainting before him. “Say, whither wouldst thou go? where, where?” His voice was preternaturally loud and shrill—she plucked her gown from his grasp, and escaped. His arms fell, extended and lifeless upon the floor; and he remained upon his knees, but gazing with a mournful, bewildered, and reproachful air upon her receding form, motionless and breathless. His lip trembled a little, with a quick and irregular feebleness, and a few tinges of crimson shot hastily over his temples—all denoting the fierce and ill subdued agitation of his spirit. He strove to rise— staggered—and reeled to a seat. He became delirious for a moment, and shouted for Elvira and Loena! He recovered, and cursed himself; and a rooted melancholy appeared to take possession of his whole countenance. But why detail these cruel vicissitudes. A vision opened so blissfully before him, inviting his heart to its expansion, and then so cruelly it shut itself up, sullenly and treacherously, just as he leaped toward it! He was in a wilderness. A flowret blossomed at his feet. It was tempting and beautiful. He stopped, and it vanished! It was cruel. On the deep solitude of the ocean, holding no fellowship with aught that was instinct with life, poor Harold had started into a rapturous sense of vitality and loveliness, with all his arteries tingling, as he awoke from a feverish and protracted dream, and found her for whom his heart panted, bowing her transcendant beauty over him, and actually dropping her tears upon his eyelids. He should have shut his eyes again, and slept forever, to prolong the innocent and delicious thrilling of that moment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. Reader! hast thou ever, in thine own chamber, while meditating on some beloved one, thought to thyself, and held thy breath as the thought arose in thy heart, how thou wouldst feel, should that beloved one, casting off all that shackled her to the vain customs of the world, holding a sublime confidence in thee, hallowed and protected by the shedding halo of her own purity, appear before thee, beside thy very couch! Hast thou never, woman? hast thou never?—Speak to me, there are no listeners present—has it not been thy wish, at midnight, in thy lonely chamber. Remember ye how your hearts sounded? Did not your very blood and pulse ring an alarum. And thou, dearest! hast thou never heard a still small voice near thy pillow; or some faint, delicate echo, like the note of a well remembered song;—hast thou not been at thy window too, love, at midnight, under a concave of deep, deep blue, and heard, in the very air, near thee, a kind and peculiar footfall; and started, with thy head beating hurriedly, as it passed thine ear, like the familiar step of him, thy most beloved:—hast thou not listened, and trembled, more than half asleep, to catch another, another, and another naked footstep upon the floor of thy chamber, struggling all the while to allay the riotous intoxication of thy thought! Thou hast. I know thou hast. It is in thine eye at this very moment. The leaves tremble in thy hand. Thy voice falters in reading. Thy breath is hurried. No mortal man—nay, not even a woman hath yet lived and loved, but hath felt all this—heard all this in some sweet revery; no man that hath not heard such gentle notes, and welcomed them; clasped some soft hand, that melted in his, and held on, and blessed it, and kissed it, trembling all over, lest, after all, it should be a delusion! and shutting out, with a delicate and almost painful perseverance, all that could dispel it! O! how often have I dreamt, in my youth, and felt, in the innocent persuasion of my heart, that, at last, I held the dear hand in mine, and felt the thrilling movement of her fingers—or the smooth, passing touch, of the gentlest and purest lips, long, long after we had parted forever. Judge ye of Harold then. Night after night had his heart gone back to the Indian girl, as to lay some sacrifice upon the altar of its idolatry; and night after night had trembled in its allegiance, and visited the earlier and wilder, and prohibited scenery of its haunts—where, let no one tell. They that have loved can tell; for they know, however they may disguise it, that love is like all other passions—it is various, and of every degree, like friendship. People talk as if a true heart can love only one; nonsense!—You may as well say that a true heart can only have one friend—one object of enmity, one ambition. True, there will be one, more loved, more hated, than any, or all others. It is a childish notion, this of one love, and one only. When you can show me a man or woman who has had but one friend, and one only, through a long life of vicissitude and affliction, having no friendship for any other human being, then will I show you one of these idolatrous lovers, whose inveterate obstinacy is so much the theme of the sentimental—and not till then. Reader! art thou indignant? Did thy heart never tremble? Lo! I have thee!—Alternately thou hast played falsely, while reading this tale! Alternately thy heart hath beaten for Loena and Elvira, Elvira and Loena. Hath it not. Confess it, and I will forgive thee. The book is written only to convince the pure in heart that he is not a heretick in love, who has loved more than one —even at the same time! But I hardly hope to succeed —The world are so obstinate. Yea—women!—ye who believe in the canons and creed of this deity—ye who are of the orthodox, believe me. You may break in upon the dwelling place of the god— this one love—dislodge him, scatter his shrines and jewelry—rend his hangings—quench his arrows—and banish his priesthood—and ere you have turned your back upon the ruin, you will hear the flutter of their wings upon their return, and you will be dazzled and blinded by the re-assembling dust that passes before you, at their command, to take the form of some other and more permanently sceptred divinity. Yea! disguise it as you will, such is love. The vacant heart is always hunting after a tenant. The censer, once kindled, it will not suffer to be extinguished, in its bridal chamber. The odour, and live coals once thrown upon the altar, must be there forever. It is tender, doubly tender after its bereavement. Let two be torn apart, two that have grown together; and you will find that neither will heal, neither stop its bleeding, till its lacerated surface, and ruptured vessels have found some other companionship, than the emollient or balsam. When its young fibres are bruised, and broken, and torn and trampled on, if there be any life left, they become inconceivably more sensitive, and while they shrink from the ungentle, they cling with the tenderest pertinacity, like searching tendrils, to whatever is sore, and bruised, and delicate like themselves. Such is love, and Harold found it so—in the fierce and dreadful aspirations of his spirit, the very indefiniteness of whose movements partook of the sublimity, which characterized it, in the wilderness and the storm. It was a spirit born and bred in the hurricane. A spectre would often pass before him, as he sat in the haunted chambers of memory,—her garments flying in the wind—mournful and incessant musick following her tread, like an echo; and he would recognize the deportment and countenance of dominion and love—passionate love—of her who first broke his heart, as with a sceptre of iron. In one of these lifted meditations had he been, when he awoke and found her, yea her of his heart, leaning over him;—her, the wronged and abused creature of his affections. No wonder that his brain rang—no wonder that his heart leaped. Her presence was the fresh cold water, scooped up for the dying man, and held to his cracked lips, by the dear hand of his beloved, who, to his dim eyes, was at that moment afar off, weeping and watching for his return. He awoke again—and found her sitting by his side, with her quiet hand upon his forehead. Harold shut his eyes—for he had not the heart to look her in the face— the rifled and abandoned lady—the creature of such pale and majestick tenderness.—Why had she never cursed him, O why? why no reproaches, no denunciations, no threats? O no—they were unworthy of her. He drew her hand to his lips—still without daring to lift his eyes,—just put them to it, and articulated “God bless thee—O no—I cannot look upon thee,—thou most injured woman—(her tears fell upon his cheek)—“Elvira!—lady—I dare not speak to thee yet—thou canst not forgive me.”—The last words were scarcely intelligible. She bowed her face upon his forehead. Their lips met—thrilled—“my God! my God!” he cried, and leaped upright in his bed. “Harold, dear Harold—what ails thee?—what art thou staring at—speak to me, dear.” His lips moved.—“I cannot—cannot—O!—leave me Loena—leave me, or she will destroy thee.” “She!” “Poor, dear Loena. Didst thou not see her? O, she was very pale.—She has been sadly dealt with—hush hush—one moment. She will not be seen by thee—hush —I will tell thee all when she is gone.” He inclined his head as if listening, and Elvira's haughty forehead trembled for a moment in the pale lamp light—and she drew her veil over her face with an agitated hand—a face, still beautiful and meek, beyond expression, but pallid as the young lily that floats upon the blue pond, gleaming in shadow and ripple. Harold put out his hands, tenderly, as if to smooth the parted locks of some sick girl—“Loena, dear,”—said he, tenderly, “she loves thee—I am sure she does. She will not harm thee—love—only do not weep.—Ha!— she is gone—gone!—that flash:—oh it scorches! it scorches!—” He turned and took Elvira's hand, and fixed his keen dark eyes upon hers, while his lashes glistened with the deep emotion of his heart. He was himself again. And all the great resolution of his nature rose, like a giant, at his command. He reverentially bowed his head upon the hand that he held, as upon the hallowed relicks of some earlier religion, in which he had been born, and with which, all that was innocent and tender was associated, in his recollections—until they were scorched and shrivelled, and polluted, in flame and blood, by the spoilers—and then, would have relinquished them forever. But no!—no! The lady understood his emotion, and his purpose. “The governour,” said she, distinctly, looking him full in the face,—Harold shuddered, and he leaned toward her with a look so intense, that it showed all at once, all that he felt, or hoped, or feared—“is dead.” Harold dropped his head upon his bosom, with a wild, inarticulate laugh. His whole face brightened and darkened successively, three or four times, before he could speak. It was now deathly—as his heart smote him for the sinfulness of his thought—“O can it be!—have Vol. II. 5 I lived to rejoice at the death of that benevolent old man,” said he. It was now glowing crimson, as he looked up, and reflected the eloquent blush of her countenance. A silent pressure, faint and trembling, re-assured him. “Harold,” whispered a voice, more indulgent than his own heart, to his own frailties, “thou didst rejoice for a moment—not, I believe, for the death of thy benefactor, but, because, by his death, thou hadst ceased to sin in thy love.” Harold blushed. It was too true. “But when, I pray thee, lady, when did this happen? nay, there are ten thousand questions, but I have not time to begin. When thou wast away, there were a hundred things that I longed to ask thee about. But I forget them all now. My heart reels with the multitude of thoughts that beset me. It is full, even to bursting, and—Father of mercies!”—The red pain shot over his forehead, and his eyes rolled again, very wildly for a moment, as he endeavoured, with the expression of detected guilt, to interpose his own form between Elvira, and something that he appeared to see:— but her pale hand allayed the one, by a single touch, and the soft breathing of affection soon subdued the other. The countenance of Elvira was troubled. “Who was this Loena—this poor, dear Loena;” she was on the point of asking a dozen times, but her pride withheld her. “But still—how in the name of heaven,” said Harold, thoughtfully, “How came we here? Where are we? Is this accident? Nay—I cannot smile—but thou mayest. I love to see thee smile. But why have I not seen thee before.—All this time—O, lady!—was this kind? How many hours, days, weeks of innocent and respectful communion have we,—forgive me, lady—have we lost.” The lady looked anxiously upon him, as if doubtful whether she heard him aright. Harold reddened. He lifted his eyes to hers beseechingly—he laid his hand upon hers—a strong hand, but the softest in the world.—Who could resist him? “It is really wonderful,” he continued, after a short, but expressive silence, “wonderful indeed, that I should never have gone in pursuit of thee, after that night, nay—nay —I am entirely recovered now—do not alarm thyself—I am indeed.—Why didst thou not speak to me?” “When? where?” said she, in agitated voice. “That evening when I met thee, just after we left Quebec.” “Harold!—recollect thyself, dear. I was never at Quebec.” “What!” cried Harold, “not near me, all the night long—did I not touch, by accident, the hem of thy garment, and did not my heart feel sanctified from that moment—as if it had been bathed, baptized all over, in some etherial essence, warm and penetrating?—And then— what madness, that I should not have known the cause of these symptoms—and followed, and plucked thee forth, from the whole body of the passengers, and wept with thee, and been with thee, from that hour to this. O, how happily might have been spent so many dreary, endless hours!” “Harold, I should say that thou wast dreaming, did not thine eyes assure me that thou art awake. Thy countenance and tone convince me that there is some foundation for this. But believe me,—and go to sleep, for indeed, dear, thou needest it.” “We shall meet hereafter, only by accident. We have met here already, by the purest accident. Nay more, for thou art young, and it were pity that thou shouldst much mistake me—thou wouldst never have seen me, even after I knew thee to be here, in the same vessel with me—separated I find, by only a thin partition—” “By heaven!” cried Harold,—“it was thy voice then, that I have so often heard, whispering my name. Ah!— yes—blush—I could look at thee forever, when thou art in confusion.—I have supposed it fancy—and yet, it thrilled me, when I was awake—I have heard it then.” “I saw thee, some time since, no matter where:— from that time I kept myself industriously concealed— a circumstance that I cannot (her eyelids dropped—and her eyes filled—and her lip trembled) cannot speak of now, betrayed thee. Another accident made me betray myself. Nay—nay—I command thee,” she continued, smiling, “to sleep now. Hereafter thou shalt know more. I have much to tell thee.” “I cannot yet.—When did he die?” “The governour?” “Yes.” “Nearly a year since.” “And how came this meeting? whence art thou?” “I had departed for England in a ship of war. It was my only chance for the season. It was the largest, and therefore the safest ship on the station. Being so, the captain was ordered to cruize awhile, along the West Indies. We had sent in a number of small vessels, and this ship which we fought the other day, is the second vessel of war that we have captured.” “After the battle, I saw thee—” her voice faultered in the first words. “After the battle?—go on,”—said Harold, eagerly. “I inquired about thee. None knew who, or what, or whence you were. A fellow prisoner of yours told me, at last, that you came on board at Quebec, under the especial countenance of the governour. Is it true?” “Yes—I am now going to Europe, under his direction.” “To Europe!—what part?” “To France. Such was my intention. Now I must go to England first.” The lady grew thoughtful—so did Harold. There was a dead silence of some minutes— some thought, which neither dared to utter.— Harold's eyes suddenly flashed fire.—Lady! Elvira! —Was it “after the battle?” She arose, and attempted to pass out. “No, no, by heaven!—thou shalt not leave me!—my brain is all on fire with the thought—whirling, whirling. Lady, speak to me—tell me—O tell me! was it not thy hand that plucked me out of the slippery shrouds?—was it not?—didst thou not, thou most exalted woman, didst thou not plunge into the thick of battle.—Gracious God! Elvira—(he gasped for breath,) quick, quick—art thou the mother of that child?” Her tears gushed out, and she laid her face upon his shoulder. He was overcome—he wept with her. Their lips met, and their tears mingled. “O, Elvira,” he whispered, “my heart knew it was thy child—how it doated on him!—Thank God! thank God! that I saved its life—the life of thy child—the babe of Elvira!” “Harold—dear Harold—” murmured Elvira, hiding her face in his bosom—“Leopold is thy child!” “Merciful heaven—what!—what!—O, Elvira—do not drive me mad. Speak to me again!—my child! mine! —Some devil is besetting me. Where art thou love? Something just whispered me—that—hush! hush—no, no, I cannot tell it. Thou wouldst die in my arms—and yet—” he raised his face drowned in tears, and crimsoned with shame, and joy, and contrition; and endeavoured, but in vain, to get a glimpse of hers,—but no— her long hair, and her hands covered it—and it was buried in his bosom. “Speak to me again, love,—tell me, whisper it—art thou indeed the mother of my child?” She pressed his hand in silence; “Leopold thy child—Leopold my child!—Harold the father of thy child! O—I am delirious with a guilty, and unnatural transport. Where is he—where is he!—I must, I will see him, before I sleep.” Elvira remonstrated, but in vain. The child, who since Harold's last illness, had been kept away, was soon produced by his mother. “O my pa! my pa!” cried the little fellow again, in the same voice as when Harold first saw him. Harold's heart danced in his bosom, and Elvira's eyes sparkled through her tears. “O Leopold!—my child! my child!”—said Harold, clasping his hands. “Our Father! I do thank thee. Now, I could die contented.” It was high time to separate. And when they next met, Harold learnt many interesting particulars of the past. A shattered ivory tablet, she said, had been found in the woods, its leaves glued together with blood—it came to the hands of a little, old, active man, with very bright eyes, half Indian, who passed for a prophet with the Indians, and was much respected among the whites; he severed the leaves, and found that Logan was of an ancient family in England, and related, by blood, to the 5* governour himself. For a long while, he had kept the affair a secret, pursuing and watching Harold, until the governour was on his death bed, when he revealed it to Elvira, with many mysterious allusions to her calamity. She was compelled to defend herself. She did so, before her dying husband. He acknowledged that he had wronged her—deceived her in marrying her; that, under an apparent disinterestedness, he had profited by her childish admiration of his valour, and her ardent gratitude, to prevent all reconciliation between her and the lord of her heart; for all which, he besought her forgiveness with a contrite and broken spirit. This was too much. She fell upon her knees, and avowed to her husband that the little boy whom he was then straining to his heart, was not his—but Harold's! The governour started as if a viper had suddenly uncoiled about his heart, and shot him through and through! He raised the child with a tremendous malediction, as if to dash out its brains, when the mother shrieked, caught it away, and told the story as it was. Such is the majesty of truth!—He grew calm. He forgave her—nay, he believed her, wept with her, and adopted the child, with his last breath, as his own—acknowledged it, and left it the bulk of his property. He died— and the last words that he uttered were, “I did wrong to marry her—she was too ambitious—too young—too beautiful.—And I—too—too old,—farewell love.” The day following, Harold arose early, and, for the first time, opened a pacquet of baggage, which had been sent on board by De Vaudreuil. He was not a little pleased—it is in vain to deny it—with the contents. There were several superb military dresses—a magnificent watch—a commission, open, with all the appendant seals, appointing him a colonel, and praying the recognition of royalty thereto. Many letters, directed to persons of rank—in Paris—and letters of credit, which Harold knew not the use of, until long afterward. He equipped himself, in a splendid dress of green and gold, with black facings, and was coxcomb enough to walk about, and get up and sit down, a number of times, with some emphasis, before he was entirely composed. He felt better—haughtier; and he was willing to acknowledge it. Indeed there is no fact of more common experience than this—that a better dress makes a man of more consequence, not only in the eyes of others, but of himself—when among strangers. Throw the greatest and wisest man upon the world, in a garb, meaner than he is accustomed to—let him have a long beard, and soiled linen, and he will be a little man directly. He will lose his aspect of authority, and tread and speak doubtfully. Every body is prepared to browbeat him, or pass him by with contempt; and what is more, he looks for it, and expects it. Hence it is a part of the religion, and politicks of a Frenchman to have one dress, as good as he can possibly afford. The greatest are restrained and humbled, by appearing worse than they are. Fill the pockets of any man—wash his face— and dress him up, and you give him clean and new ideas. His countenance, and tone, change upon the spot. His very loll is graceful, or imposing; and he feels that it is so. He does better, and what he does, is better received. Therefore, reader, I should say to thee, and I would have thee remember it, let thy colour be what it may, that it is better to be a fool and a knave, and appear graceful and gentlemanly, than to be the wisest and best man, and appear dirty and lubberly—among strangers I mean. And why?—because you pass before a multitude, with whose first glance, you are judged forever. They never see you again. Few—very few can, or will take the trouble, to penetrate what is repulsive or discouraging; and few, therefore, can ever know the real worth of a man, while his apparent worth is always obtruding itself upon their senses. Harold was intoxicated for a few moments—a few moments; but, after a while, his self-complacency began to abate. His eye fell upon a suit of citizen's dress—and then upon a fashionable frock. He was bewildered. In the mere listlessness of the moment, he was about trying on another suit, when he observed some linen curiously wrought below. This led to a further examination; and such was the sensibility of his nature, such his gratitude for all this kind-hearted attention, that he pressed article after article to his heart, like some overgrown girl, when first rummaging a new baby house. He plucked out his watch.—He stamped with vexation! “Five o'clock only!—and they would not breakfast for three whole hours.” It was too much for mortal patience. He sat down, and twirled his thumbs, and twisted and fidgetted about—put his hands upon his watch chain—and then forbore to pull it out, a little while longer, with a determination that, he flattered himself, partook of the sublime. “Thank heaven,” said he, at last, “one hour at least has passed, since I looked at it.”—He took it out again. It was only ten minutes later. The hands appeared motionless—he feared that it had stopped—he listened—but even that consolation was denied him. He had half a mind to undress, and go to bed again.— “Oh, my dear boy!”—O, I am glad to see thee!”— he said, as Leopold, newly washed and brightened, jumped into his arms,—and clambered up in his lap, delighted, beyond expression, at the beautiful buttons, and splendid trimmings of Harold's dress. He kissed Harold, again and again, pinched his cheeks, played with his hair, jumped down, and ran about capering and clapping his hands like a mad creature, shouting—“O, my pa! my pa!”— Harold's brown complexion and deeply coloured lips and cheeks—his flashing eyes—all grew deeper and brighter at the sound. Leopold pointed out a hat with plumes.—Harold put it on, and was struck with his own martial appearance, as reflected in the mirrour. It was of a singular fashion, and its fur trimming made it resemble the warriour turban that he had once worn in battle. His bold front had never endured a hat. Leopold was half frantick with delight, nor could he be appeased until he had helped his “pa” buckle a cimitar upon his thigh: an unfortunate affair for poor Harold, as it led an officer, who happened to pass the door, as he walked to and fro on duty, to look in, and then go to the captain and detail the mysterious transformation that he had seen. The captain sent his compliments, and desired to see the officer, for so he appeared, by his quality and bearing in the battle, as well as by this martial preparation. “Sir,” said the messenger,” descending and touching his hat, “the commander's compliments, and expects you upon the quarter deck.” Harold could not help blushing, but he repelled the insolent look of the intruder, with a glance of such imperial steadiness and fire, that the man shut his eyes as if the hot lightning had fallen, melted, upon his balls. A quick feeling of native pride and indignation succeeded in Harold's heart; and, in the twinkling of an eye, he was equipped:—At the electrifying effect of anger, all the thousand petty and provoking awkwardnesses of a new dress were forgotten. He forgot his trepidation— forgot Leopold—himself, and even Elvira, and was already on deck, before he thought of preparing himself for the interview. And lucky indeed for him was it, that he was unprepared. Preparation would have ruined him. He was like some speakers, who are only eloquent and natural, when they have no time to be unnatural. Like them he could forget, at the sound of a single word, as it tingled in his ear, all his timidity, and all his embarrassment. Before he knew how he had got there,—Harold stood, face to face, with the present commander, even in the plenitude of his authority, uncovered and undisturbed, with the tread of a soldier, and the look of a young champion, about to enter the tilting ground, against whomsoever it should please heaven. A general murmur of surprise and encouragement welcomed him. There was, moreover, an involuntary movement of all, that bespoke respect. “Sir,” said the new made captain, turning toward him with his arms folded, as he strode fore and aft the deck, in a tone of good natured, honest, blunt arrogance—his little, gold laced hat, perched awry upon his round, fat, red face,—his hair standing out from under it, in all directions, and stiff with what looked like tar, at least,—his long white waistcoat, with enormous flaps, smutted and greased, and falling away from the buttons, and his shirt sticking out between that and the waistband of his breeches, with a venerable midshipman, of about sixty or seventy years of age, at his elbow—“Sir—you are an officer I take it.” “No, sir.” “No, sir—damme, what d'ye mean by that? Two epaulets, and no officer!—a cheese toaster half as long as our main mast, and no officer!”— “What regiment, sir—Come, come—His majesty has no reason to be ashamed of you. What regiment?” “Sir—I do not know,” said Harold sternly. “I have answered your question once!” “Where is your commission, sir?” “On the table below, in my state room.” A servant was despatched.—“Damn this lingo,” said the captain, holding it up sideways between his thumb and finger,—“I am no scholar—this here Latin stuff never suited me.—Your diplomas, and epitaphs, and things, why arn't they in English? Are they not to be read? Symmons, send the chaplain here.” The chaplain came, and assured his commander that it was not Latin—“treason perhaps, for he could not expound it.” Harold now recollected his danger. He was a British subject—holding a commission from the French, in time of war!— “Sir,” said the commander, “you appear to be a gentleman, sir. You are a brave fellow, that I'll swear to. You have done your duty against his majesty's enemies. There is your commission. I don't ask you what it is. But, if there be any thing under the hatches—why— take my advice, and keep it there. Sir, I remember that I once carried, for charity, a whole cargo of miserable, dirty devils, with their heads all bound up, over to the land of the monsieurs. But they changed wonderfully when we touched the port. They were all marquisses, and generals, and the devil knows what all—and I was finely choused. Sir, the whole hospital—the lame, and the blind, and the halt, were knighted on the spot. It appeared that I had brought home a whole cargo of their ancient nobility. This made me suspect you. You will pardon me—for I shall now order a search among all our prisoners, and who knows but I may find some patent of nobility—damn it!—why, may be, that's one!— Harold laughed outright, at the sudden change of tone and look which accompanied this remark, but he assured the honest sailor that he had nothing to fear; he was no nobleman. Harold returned to his cabin and attempted to repack his clothes, but while thus engaged, a paper that was sewed within the folds of a handkerchief, rustled in his hand. Could he be deceived! His eyes glanced at it— his hands shook—and he felt a sickness at the heart. He opened it. His feeling, his truth were not extinct—he fell upon his knees on the spot. The paper dropped from his hand—it was blank, save one scrawl in the middle. It was blistered all over, as with rain drops—were they tears? The letters of his name were traced hazardously, and without any knowledge of their import, one would have thought. But he knew better—her hand had traced them! her eyes had wept over them! and—what was that!—something fell from the inner fold. It was a lock of hair!—her hair. “O, bless thee! bless thee for it!” cried the agitated boy. He sat down and mused, and pressed his temples. “What,” said he, aloud—“of what am I made? Have I no heart?—none!—Where is my fidelity? no heart, no feeling, no sense of the desolation that besets her!—She scorned to complain—she never reproached me—and yet, she wept over me,—and her own undisciplined fingers have scrawled the characters of my name, while her heart was breaking. Where is my resolution? I have been very weak, wicked. I have taught her to conceal the most innocent working of her own pure heart. Ha!— mother!—is it thy breath that I feel upon my forehead— stirring my hair.—Loena, is it thine, dear? Mother! Loena—weep for me. I am very miserable. Ye have seen me weep—no, not thou, my mother, but she has. And when, when was it?—not at the stake, not in the mortal agony. No!—Had my heartstrings been snapped asunder in the vehement gaspings of my heart—had I been torn, limb from limb, ligament from ligament, and burnt to ashes, would I have shed a single tear?—No!— Then why have I wept with thee, Loena—and for thee? Indeed, I know not; and yet there is a melancholy pleasure in it—something so sweet and delicious, so soothing, and so dear to the bruised and weltering heart. Even now I could lie down, and weep myself to death.— Love!—Shall I, can I be faithful to thee,—to thee, whose only beauty, as thou hast told me often, is thy sincerity, whose only dower is thy valorous devotion? That dear confiding girl! O, who knows of what she is capable! She told me—and proved it, by irresistible evidence, that she loved me. And yet, mayhap, she has cast me off for ever. Could she have loved me? Yea— she did. I know she did—beyond all things in heaven and earth. And yet—she has torn herself asunder from me—untangled—unknotted—and rent away every fibre and nerve that was intertwined, or interwoven, with any of mine.—If it be—she is an heroick creature!” Harold's cheek reddened. Loena had threatened him. A threat! from her too, a being in his power!—almost living and breathing upon his will. He started upon his feet; and paced the apartment, with a troubled eye, a few times. He became composed. He returned. He sat down. He dwelt upon her love, her loveliness, the apparent meekness, yet fiery intrepidity of her character; her gentle and sweet admonition; the wonderful self command that she had sometimes shown—her power over herself—he dwelt upon all this, until he grew proud of her, unspeakably proud of her. “Could she leave me?” he asked himself, again and again; “could she?” Harold doubted her power, and was half inclined to try her, as no woman was ever yet tried, feeling, while his own character evolved, like tapestry, in the light and wind of a storm, full of magnificence, beauty and terrour, that he never could marry one who was not capable of undergoing a fiery ordeal—treading, literally, with naked feet, over heated plough-shares—yea more, of tearing herself loose from every human being—every living thing—in earth and heaven—except her Maker, if that were the penalty of abandoning a loved one, who had acted unworthily. He thought of her last words. They rang in his ear. His heart listened, and echoed them. They dwelt upon his memory with a heavy, perturbed, tolling prolongation, like a death bell sounding in a sepulchre,—for a subterranean funeral. A tear dropped upon his hand. He started— he had not the strength, no, nor the heart, to wipe it away. There was no aching of his vitals, no scorching of his eye-balls now; and yet, he wept. The tears did not rush like blood to his eyes, as if his heart had burst with the effort—no! that time had passed; but they gathered slowly, and fell, drop by drop, with a mournful pleasure—a sweet melancholy sensation, such as the heart might be supposed to feel, if it were naked, and the moisture of twilight fell upon it—starshine, air, and dew. Harold was subdued—utterly subdued; to be so loved, so treasured, so tenderly and so loftily by one, to whom he had been playing falsely.—He clasped his hands, and bowed his head upon them; and felt, for a moment, as if his heart were bounding against the heart of his own dear, dear Loena. The hair was turned about his fingers. The touch recalled him. So jetty and smooth!—Loena had ever been remarkable for the wavy luxuriance of her tresses, and their glittering shadowy beauty; they were Indian only in their shining blackness: not in their rich and glistening undulations—and this! then, was the loveliest of them all! He uncoiled it, drew it through his hand, smoothed it,—and his fingers thrilled to the bone. He remembered it—that very lock, he was sure, had once parted upon her forehead; for he once, as they sat together, of a moonshiny night, by a blue fountain that sparkled over its pebbly barrier, and oozed through the abundant moss, like a perspiration of quicksilver; a feathery and whimsical grouping of light trees playing with the air of heaven, just over their heads, and the dim mountains towering between them and a sky of surpassing brilliancy and distance—once! on such a night, in such a scene, he had pressed her forehead with his lips, and smoothed her beautiful hair, as it waved, and rose and fell, very slightly, in the fresh air, like satin, rumpled in the wind and dew, and shining in the starlight. Yea!—it was the very lock—that which he had caressed so often and so tenderly. Vol. II. 6 An approaching step alarmed him—with the trepidation of guilt, he attempted eagerly to conceal the hair; but it was impossible; it was so entangled with all his fingers: at last he succeeded, and advanced, glittering in his uniform, and blushing to the eyes, with the hair waving in his hand. It was Elvira. Her eye glanced, like lightning, from one to the other, changing its expression as rapidly, and finally resting on the hair. She compressed her beautiful lip, and a transient shoot of crimson passed over her forehead. Harold attributed her confusion to his imposing appearance! a flutter of gratified vanity was the consequence, and he took her hand, so graciously. She raised her blue eyes to his—he dropped her hand, and stood trembling before her. His dress was no longer becoming. He was sorrowful. In his warlike Indian garb, so picturesque, so martial, he had no rival—it seemed made for him—designed for him—and his carriage, head, and look, seemed made for that!—and then, how he strode in it! Now—he would be compared with others, to whom the strange habiliments that he now wore, were familiar. How would he stand the comparison? Hitherto his dress had been a standing explanation, and history of his character. It was strikingly free and spirited, and accorded admirably, with his swarthy complexion, and eye of unearthly brightness, as if it were the foil, and setting, of some dark jewelry. And she—why stood she thus?—her queenly aspect overmastering all the woman for awhile: her innate disdain of all puerility, and all the paltry devices of a coxcomb, overtopping for a moment, all her delight and tenderness. Harold awoke. He would have given his right hand, that he had never seen the detested baubles that encumbered him. In his vexation, and disappointment, he could have taken the watch from his pocket, and dashed it upon the floor—and trampled on it—and ground it to dust—as he observed the slight motion of her upper lip, while her eye glanced, scornfully and deliberately, over the chain. There she stood!—and never was the unruffled grandeur of woman more finely opposed, to the disturbed and agitated embarrassment of man. Harold determined to be at ease—made many desperate efforts, but all were ineffectual. He feared to move, lest she might think it a trick for display. And he dared not be still, lest she might imagine that he could not move. Did she enjoy his embarrassment? Indeed it were hard to tell; her, emotions were strangely contradictory. He was certainly, even in this uniform, what the ladies would have called an “elegant fellow,” but he was not what she had loved; the wild Indian boy—or rather, the Indian prince, whose fierce eye, and untractable spirit, first awakened the lioness in her heart. He stood now before her, not in the solitude—the awful solitude of the wilderness, wrapped in fur, his half naked limbs, full of expression and character, all his sinews quivering with the excess of his natural electricity—and no matter in what other character he might appear, it seemed to her that he was no longer Harold. Elvira addressed a few common-place observations to him—in a remarkably lady-like, courteous, and unconstrained style—(for which, by the way, Harold never forgave her!) and then turned, in her stateliest manner, and departed—without one expostulating gesture or look, from the proud Indian. She was gone, gone! and he gradually sunk upon his seat, stupified and humbled to the earth. “Can it be?” said he—“this woman, this queenly one, can it be that I have strained her to my bosom convulsively—Can she be the creature whose warm cheek—and trembling lips— and scalding tears, I have heretofore felt upon my own cheeks, for whole minutes—in one embrace! Merciful heaven! can it be!—But stay—were it not worth while to avenge myself?—Dear, dear Loena—thy simple and affectionate heart would never have supported thee to this. Thou shalt regain thy ascendency.—” A whole day passed—wearily indeed—but it passed; and the night came. Harold, troubled and tossed about for weeks and weeks as he thought, now half determined to arise and write to her,—and now half resolved to buckle on the sternest of his mental panoply—and forget her—and scorn her. But no!—that was not for him to do. Feverish and worried, he at length arose, and at deep midnight, and scrawled a letter to her— “Lady!— “Forgive me! That I have sinned, I am sure, and yet I know not how. I cannot sleep. The paper is blistered with my tears. There was that in the rebuke, with which I was left, dearest of women, which I cannot, cannot drive from my recollection. What means it? Are we to meet no more?—no more, as we have met? Lady, forgive me. I am distracted. Let me see you once more— but once—for one single moment, and then, if we must part for ever and ever—I will obey.” The moment that there was sufficient light to see his way, Harold was upon deck, habited as of old, feeling a new manhood in his frame, a higher and more pervading sense of his own dignity than ever. Little Leopold came whooping and hallooing to him. How lucky! Harold gave him the note,—and then recalled it. It would excite remark, and, with all his habitual indiscretion, there was that innate and delicate sense of propriety, which is always the attendant on pure affection, to restrain him, at such seasons. He thought of a book which he had. He put the note in that, and sent Leopold with the book to his mother. No answer came. The day passed away; and they were near land. But the shouting of the crew, and the tumultuous gratitude of the passengers, as the bluish cliffs of Albion appeared like a waving and broken cloud, upon the centre horizon, were of no interest to him. His pride was wounded. But perhaps, perhaps the note was lost; perhaps too—his heart leaped at the thought, and he gasped for breath—perhaps, she was ill.—He shuddered. Leopold had said that his mother would not kiss him, when he left her. Her frail and exquisitely delicate constitution had, at last, yielded to her watchfulness and anxiety over him. And how had he requited her? He could have lain down and wept like a child, at the thought. He determined to know the truth.—She was sick, sick at heart. He learnt this, and was willing to forget all, even his pride, in the overflowing of his tenderness—and love— yes love! Was it treason? No matter—treason or not, he had said it now, and he cared not, though it were trumpeted to the four corners of heaven. He wrote again. “What is my fault? O, tell me. What a day have I passed!—a day of sorrow and humiliation, such as I could never have believed that I was capable of supporting. Lady!—I do not deserve it. What have I done? O, tell me in mercy. I am prepared for the worst; for any thing, rather than this terrifick uncertainty. At least, send me back the book,—it is now my only relick of thee.” The book was returned. Upon a blank leaf was scrawled, with a pencil, in a trembling hand, “You have deceived me. You deceive yourself. You love another. I would have you wholly mine—no rival— none! Never, never would I share a divided heart. I have resources. There is a career open to me,—that, and the devotion of the few who love me—will support me. I have had my dreams—but they are past. Farewell!—farewell!—heaven bless you.” Harold wept; and who would not weep? She was sick—sick unto death; and why? O, full well did he know it—sick, sick at the heart? He read the letter over and over again, a hundred times. Every syllable burnt itself into his heart. His memory was on fire. Forgetful of all, of his beloved, yea even of Loena, her who he had loved so truly, he replied.— “Almighty God! Lady—can it be possible! This then is the cause of your illness. Lady, hear me. I cannot lose you now. I cannot. Hear me, I conjure thee. `Deceive thee!'—no!—No, I never have deceived thee, I never can. `Loved another.' Yes it is true. I have loved another. But how?—not as I love now. She was artless, young, and inexperienced, with many high, and many noble qualities, but—she was not Elvira. Let me see you. I must see you. I cannot, will not survive a separation.” Elvira was asleep, when the note was brought. She awoke—read it—and they met; were reconciled, and happy. Alas! for Loena. They arrived. Harold and Elvira stood together, side by side, before she stepped into a magnificent carriage that awaited her,—about to part for ever. Their hearts had been fearfully disturbed of late,—and now they were 6 * inconceivably more devoted to each other than ever. She was too thrillingly sensible of his changes—accustomed always to kindness, and courtesy, the slightest intermission of either was death to her. Harold was anxious, yet afraid to touch her hand. With much effort, however, he at last stammered out an offer to escort her to her dwelling. The offer was affectionately accepted. They rode side by side in silence. Harold was in a new world—he had been compelled, for his own convenience, after all, to adopt the uniform of a French officer, and he was not yet at home in it. The carriage stopped at a magnificent mansion. They were alone in it. Their eyes met. They embraced. It was the last time. She leant her head upon his shoulder, and wept. Harold took her hand. It was motionless and cold. He pressed it. It made no acknowledgment, showed no sensibility. “Elvira,” said he, as she alighted, “I cannot part so.” She recovered, smiled through her tears, threw aside her veil for one moment, and murmured, “God for ever bless you! Harold—dear Harold.” “And thee! and thee, love,” was his answer, “for ever and ever!”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Harold was on the point of ascending a flight of marble steps, amid all the attendants that were arrayed, by the previous arrangements of a relation, to whom the arrival of Lady Elvira had been made known by the first boat;—but he hesitated, he could not—it was too publick, and all that had passed, seemed whirling, and mingling with the present and future, before his eyes. He grew dizzy, and caught at the brazen balustrade. The awful distance to the palace, for so this noble mansion appeared to his inexperienced eyes, and even the throng of busy and happy faces about him, oppressed him with an insupportable feeling of insignificance and melancholy. A bustle in the hall seemed to indicate that some person of consequence was approaching. Harold still lingered—and Elvira, by a significant look, arrested him as he prepared to go, and to a middle aged, handsome man that approached, presented him as colonel De Vandereuil—Harold started—“a French officer,”—adding, “We shall be happy to see you in the evening, colonel— you will not disappoint us—the gentleman of the house seconded the invitation with great cordiality.—“The carriage will convey you whither you order;”—said he, and then entered the house. Harold bowed, and sprang down the steps—but struck by the appearance of a beautiful horse that stood near, with a groom holding it, he flung his arm over the animal's neck, and began caressing it, with his accustomed ardour. His spirit revived—he forgot himself entirely, and actually sprang into the saddle, before he had asked to whom it belonged, precisely as he would have done, had he met him running wild in the American forest! The animal leaped upright, and snorted furiously. “Wo! Cæsar, wo!” cried the groom, abandoning the reins, and starting, at what he had no doubt was the freak of a madman. Elvira threw up the window, and smiled—and the next moment a servant descended, with sir Edward Armains' compliments, desiring the colonel to make what use he pleased of Cæsar—but he was a most perilous animal. Harold blushed, and bowed—and the creature stood, under his loose rein, and firm seat, stamping, with affected petulance, flinging the thick foam over the servants, and arching his bold neck in the sunshine, as if conscious that he was the admiration of all that stood around, and waiting the signal only, to charge, in thunder and lightning, upon the rabble. Another window was raised:—the sound started the horse, and he plunged headlong down the street, his iron hoofs striking incessant sparkles from the pavement— while Harold, conscious that he was observed, for he heard a faint, suppressed cry above him, gave him his way without any restraint—dashed through the crowd, and narrowly escaped collision, with a magnificent equipage that came thundering round the corner of a narrow street; before his rider, who felt that he had been longer out of practice than he had at first believed, and was still giddy with the motion of the ship—had recollected himself fully. One of his earliest maxims had been, to ride always as if he expected to be thrown—to be always on his guard; and he acted upon it, long after it was forgotten, from habit. It was but a moment, however, that he was dispossessed of his habitual self-mastery. The next, by the sudden compressure of his thighs, he arrested the animal, as instantaneously, as if he had been shot through the heart. He reared upright once, and stood stock still, quivering all over;—his red nostrils, red as raw flesh, shivering as the hot smoke streamed out, and his heart and lungs sounding in his chest. “Zounds!” cried a person joining him, with an expression of hearty delight in his honest, broad face, “you have mastered a colt that never was mastered before. Sir Edward will thank you indeed. He has broken the neck of one groom for him, and dislocated the collar bone of a particular friend: has been under the circus riders, and a score of jockeys, all to no purpose. I never saw that rascal,” he continued, endeavouring to get near the horse, and soothe him, but in vain, for he appeared to disdain all caressing, and wheedling—“I never saw him in his tantrums, that he did'nt unhorse—crack!” As he uttered this, he slapped his hands together smartly, and Cæsar leaped upright at the sound. “There! there!—I told you so. You have'nt half done with him yet. He'll unhorse you now, if you dont mind your eye.” Harold, however, though somewhat electrified at this new evidence of rebellion, from a creature that he thought utterly subdued, instantly brought him to his bearings. He had no fear of being unhorsed, that was an event, not within his experience. He had ridden the untrained colt of the desert, without saddle or bridle, whip or thong, and never had he been thrown, never had he fallen, but when the animal tumbled with him. Harold heard a good deal of speculation about him. “He is so and so,” says one; “He belongs to the circus,” said another; “No, no,” said a third, “don't I know him? is'nt it the prince's groom!” Harold wheeled his charger abruptly round, and felt for the hilt of his sword. Luckily for him, it was left behind, or the speaker would have been made a head shorter, in the twinkling of an eye. To be mistaken for one, playing his premeditated pranks!—it was too bad! Harold moved on, amid a crowd of ragged boys, perpetually augmenting on his way, dodging, and running in an out, among the coal carts, wheelbarrows, and carriages, and shouting “Hourra for the prince!” “Hourra for the circus!” “Hourra for Cæsar!” supposing that was the name of the rider. The poor fellow was inconceivably mortified. Woe to his vanity!—never had he indulged in it, but it led him into some confounded scrape. His companion was at his side. “Who the devil are you?” said the irritated Harold, turning short upon him, wearied to death with his importunity and gabble. The man laughed in his face.—“Well, faith, if you ar'nt a pleasant chap! Here have I been telling you, over and over again, who I am, and what I am, and now, you turn snap on a fellow, and snub him up, damned genteely, I must say,—with `who the devil are you!' Sir, I'll tell you who I am,—I'm Sir Edward's private chaplain—Sir —I am so.” “His chaplain!” “Yes sir—I've told you so, a dozen times already: but never mind—where will you go? where stay? I'm at your service. My nag here, is well broke, and, if you say so, we'll look about us a while before dinner. I dine with you—you know?” “With me!” said Harold, in unaffected astonishment. “Certainly—certainly, my dear fellow—colonel—a— a—” Harold could forbear no longer. He laughed aloud —“a chaplain!—a clergyman!” spunging upon him, so unaffectedly—so unceremoniously! “Very well, sir, we will dine together then. And you shall lead me whither you will,” said Harold, as soon as he could breathe. “Done! for a thousand—now that's what I like. I'll show you the place—such a table!—such wine!—that's hearty, ye see.” Harold's appetite for observation began to revive, as they strolled along the broad and beautiful streets, glittering with equipages, and encumbered, as he thought, with all the magnificent lumber of earth and ocean. He was stunned and wearied too, with the perpetual movement about him, the giddy whirl of faces, the infernal clattering, and all his bones ached, with the incessant effort of his muscles to restrain the mettlesome colt. This increased, until the throbbing of his temples, and the rattling of his feet in the stirrups, apprised him of his danger. He threw himself off—staggered, and well nigh fainted. His limbs were useless—nor was he aware what desperate muscular action he had used, until it was necessary to use them a little in another way. “You look very pale,” said his conductor, the Rev. Tom Senclare; “What will you drink?—there is a house close by.” “Nothing, sir, nothing. Let us go in here.” “Here!—damn it! why this is the duke of Bridgwater's.” “Well, what of that. Come, let us go in a moment— I only want to sit down, I care not where.” “Mighty free, 'faith!—but, I say, colonel, had'nt we better pop into some coffee house, or tavern, hey? may be his grace may be out.” “Tavern!—what is that?” The Rev. Mr. Senclare looked at him for some time, in consternation. “Poor fellow!—egad, it's all over with him—not know what a tavern is—wants to step in and rest himself, in a duke's drawing room—poor fellow!” “Sir!” said Harold, “has a duke no humanity? will he not suffer a fellow creature to rest himself a moment under his roof? If not, why go to a tavern; what right have we to expect another will treat us more kindly? Are they not all alike?” The clergyman looked dreadfully blank. His red gills faded. “I suppose,” said he, playing with his glass, which dangled at the button hole of his waistcoat, that was literally buttonless, with the air of united foppery and nastiness—“I suppose you are not without money.” “Money?—yes—I am,—what is that?” “My good fellow,” said Senclare, becoming every moment more familiar, as he found him more and more helpless, and losing his awe, altogether, in a burst of humanity, “Come, come, go with me. I have some cash left—and what I have, is yours.” Harold understood nothing of the plan; but, as he held on the bridle of his horse, he pressed his hand gratefully, and walked on, saying, “I cannot endure this noise. It sounds to me like the roaring of the Atlantick. When I set my foot upon the firm earth, I feel the motion of the vessel in it—and in these flat stones. Let us begone.” Whether it was that the Rev. gentleman had no luck in riding, or that the recollection of some disastrous evolutions, which he had once been compelled to perform, with great precipitation, before a multitude of ladies, had unfitted him for horsemanship, we do not pretend to say; but this we do know, that he regarded good horsemanship, with the profoundest veneration, as the ne plus ultra of science, and wisdom, and breeding. And when he saw Harold managing the unconquerable colt, as if he were a part of the animal, it created a sudden and extraordinary emotion in him. From that moment, he attached himself to him. Here was another case in confirmation of Harold's characteristick—he loved to be unexpected. Whatever he did, he seemed to do well; and he knew that that seeming would be exceedingly enhanced, could his display appear the effect of unquestioned accident. Thus, he danced, and walked, and rode, and wrestled, and fenced, remarkably well, and yet no one could charge him with having sought any opportunity for mere display. It had been insufferably amusing to Harold, to witness the clumsy attempts of the chaplain at horsemanship, and yet more irresistibly so, to see his round, honest face, shining with such perpetual self-complacency, as he would lean over the bony neck of his pitching and ricketty charger, whose joints rattled like some crazy enginery over a rough pavement, pat him, and caress him, and comb out his grizzly and tangled mane with his fingers, and cry “woa! woa!—my fine fellow, woa!” as if soothing some unmanageable charger: and this too, while the whip and spur might have been applied to him in vain, after he had been flayed alive. They were received at a superb hotel, in distinguished style; the chaplain being perfectly at home, and doing the honours of the house in a most comfortable manner. Having secured an apartment, ordered a porter for his baggage, and dined; a friendly conversation ensued, in which, the chaplain manifested one of the best hearts in the world; and, after much questioning, discovered and explained the use of his letters of credit, promising to get him advances from some French house directly. Soon after this arrangement, Harold renewed his rambles, merely to kill time, until evening; but his feet were soon sore with the pavements. He stopped and leaned against a lamp post. The multitude went by, like a crowded panorama. “A few months since,” said he, to himself, “a savage—roving the woods of America— a lover!—and of whom?” His reflections became insupportable; he rambled, he knew not whither; palaces and churches past before him, and many nations, peoples, and tongues, but they passed as before a sleeping man, in indistinctness and confusion, leaving no vestige behind. The lamps were lighted—a new cause of wonder to him—their interminable lines, approaching in the distance—they reminded him of his engagement. He started—was it necessary to change his dress? Had he time to do it? No—he would not—this was a comfortable one, and why should he change it? Indeed he began to like it much better than his Indian garb—perhaps because it was more convenient, lighter, and more beautiful; and, perhaps, because he was unwilling to profane that garb of royalty and dominion, by exposing it to a brutal populace. At home, it was the battle signal—here, in London, it might be the butt of mockery. He stamped, as the thought lightened through his brain. By the happiest accident in the world, he was arrested with the touch of a friendly hand, as he was passing by a magnificent building, illuminated from top to bottom. He turned—it was the very house. The chaplain was at his elbow. “I have been hunting the town through for you,” said he. Harold ascended the steps in silence. His heart misgave him, as the light burst upon him, with the sound of many voices: but it was too late,—he was expected, and the doors were flung wide open before his approach—and he entered the first of a superb suit, of rooms, all of which were crowded, in a dead silence. What meant it? Was he to be oppressed, dazzled and blinded at once? Or was it in kindness, because it is sometimes easier to face a multitude, than a few? A gentleman approached, and accosted him with the accent of inquiry. “Colonel De Vandreuil, I believe?” Harold bowed, and coloured. That was not his name; and yet, what other name had he? Logan, it was true, was his by birthright; but who knew Logan, or cared for him, in London? “And perhaps,” said he, aloud, while his eyes flashed fire—“perhaps they may dignify the Logans, by the title of colonel Logan!—damnation!” The gentleman saw the working of his nether lip, and bowed again, as if expecting an answer, in some anxiety. “Yes sir—so I am called.” “A card;” said the other, and immediately presented one to him. It was in a well known hand. “Ask for the lady Beryl. You will be led to me. Speak to me, as if you were yet in the governour's family. Be prepared for every thing. Show no astonishment, whatever may happen. Let nothing surprise you. Be not intimidated. Be yourself—be Logan!” The gentleman left him, and passed out. His heart beat furiously—stopped—and beat again; a mist came over his eyes. “I will,” said he, audibly, “I will;” and turning to a servant, he said, “lead me to my lady Beryl.” The servant bowed, and led him forward, through two rooms, blazing with lights. A strange stillness followed him; and he traversed the last apartment, deliberately, with a firm step, while every eye was upon him. A party, who were all busy, very busy, in the sprightly nothingness of fashionable employment, separated as he approached, and drew themselves up, in silence, as if to receive a standard; and a lady, whom he instantly recognized, advanced to meet him—but, heaven and earth, how changed!—Harold scarcely dared to lift his eyes to her face. Her beauty was awful and majestick. She was glittering in pearl and black—her dark hair was parted in simplicity, upon her pale forehead, and interlaced with broad bands of threaded pearl, that passed aslant over her temples: her sweeping drapery, her perfect waist, the beautiful dropping of her shoulders, and her look of encouraging frankness, as she promptly extended her hand to him, took poor Harold almost off his feet. He was petrified at her self-command. VOL. II. 7 `Colonel,' said she, `I am delighted to meet you again, and acknowledge, in the house of my brother, how deeply sensible I am of your obliging, and incessant attentions on the passage, to myself and child.' As she said this, and he faltered out some unintelligible reply, she stood more erect. He instantly comprehended her, and followed her example. He was then successively presented to the family of the governour, as he, of whom they had `heard so much.' Harold instantly recovered himself. His dark eyes lighted up, and he threw a glance over the faces about him, with all the deliberate leisure and nonchalance of high fashion. They shrunk, however, from his inquisitive look, but admired his composure. This was an experiment to him, but he made it the essential rule of his future conduct, never to doubt, never to hesitate—It being better to offend, by disregarding custom, than by being ignorant of it, particularly of fashionable custom. For the former you are never ridiculed, though you may be hated; for the latter you are always ridiculed, and sometimes hated too. A new face, apparently seeking an opportunity of studying his, without being seen, soon attracted his eye. It was, as he caught a glimpse of it, the countenance of one profoundly acquainted with man—another passed—It was full of fiery impetuosity—their eyes met—an unequivocal expression of pleasure passed over the lips of each. All eyes were upon Harold. All were delighted with the sudden and beautiful variations of character, to be seen in his face. An old, and remarkably tall, stately man, was among them. From the first moment that Harold opened his lips, he had fixed his eyes upon him, and kept them there. `Astonishing,' said he, at last, reluctantly withdrawing his eyes—`De Vaudreuil! a Frenchman! astonishing!' He moved, and shook his venerable head, with the aspect of royalty, repeatedly, as he renewed his gaze, from time to time. A servant was passing. The old man touched his elbow, and when he turned and saw Harold, a sudden exclamation of surprise broke from his lips. Harold was exceedingly embarrassed. How strange it was; go where he would, he was forever thus watched and assailed. Was it custom? No; for he saw that other strangers were overlooked. Turn which way he would, he found himself exposed to the most painful scrutiny —a perpetual attention too, respectful, it was true, but nevertheless, of a nature terribly irksome to him. He felt as if there was henceforth, to be no quiet for him; no solitude, on this earth. He could not be alone. He felt as if he were haunted! He heard a quick cry. Some one touched him, in the crowd that passed him, and as he turned, whispered, `be surprised at nothing!' He instantly awoke, and pressed a hand convulsively—`merciful heaven!' he cried, and dropped the hand. It was the hand, not of Elvira, but of an old man—he shook in all his joints, as a pair of little eyes, preternaturally vivid, were turned upon his face. He was barely restrained, indeed, from uttering a cry of horrour; for the last time that he had seen this apparition was in the blank solitude of the west—by a voice that he knew. `Be undisturbed!' it said. It was Elvira's; and he felt as grateful, as if she had laid, forever, some spectre that had long haunted him. She passed on, and Harold followed her, and found her occupied by, and occupying, a whole room of really intelligent people. Never had he seen her so fascinating, so full of spirit, and grace, and promptitude; her tone thrilled through and through him, at times. He heard voices in low conversation, near him. He turned, but there was nobody near him, so occupied. Could it be his fancy? One said `no, no, a Logan.' Then a pause followed, and after a few moments, the same voice continued, in a whisper, that, had his eyes been shut, Harold would have believed to be within reach of his arm—`resemblance!' pho! it is he, himself— the whole family.' `But why not apprise us of it?' said another, eagerly. `Oh, that is for you and others, to discover. Resemblances are always easy to find, when we go in search of them—we are delighted with our own sagacity, you know, in guessing right for a portrait, and pained, if we are wrong. No, they would have it acknowledged, by all, accidentally, without any premeditation.' Harold's uneasiness at length, became downright irritation. To be thus examined, even in kindness, by one who could not brook any examination, seemed to be carrying matters a little too far. His face soon showed what was passing in his mind, and the whispers instantly ceased. But others, at a distance, were still talking about him, and they paid no regard to his agitation. It seemed to give excitement to their remarks; for as he became more and more impatient, they became more and more earnest and emphatick, in their gesticulation and glances. Harold's patience was now gone. He threw up his front, with that lofty and intrepid manner, which was so peculiarly his own, when all his character was about to break out at once—what was his surprise and mortification?—there was a general and unqualified burst of recognition, and Elvira looked at him, as if, at that moment, he were acting a part, and had exactly touched out with terrible distinctness, some point, hitherto held inaccessible, of his original. `Remember your lesson, Harold!' said she, coming near him. `You are a heedless pupil—be patient, cool, and circumspect.' Harold heard her; and while he wondered the more, at what she said, stood trebly braced for the conflict, as her eyes shone upon him. One desperate effort— one!—and he took her hand, and conducted her to the group, into which, he immediately penetrated, and began a conversation, with three or four, at the same time, partly in French, to a lady, who so addressed him, partly in Spanish, to an officer that was present, and partly in English, of such raciness, energy, and poignancy, that lady Elvira was overpowered, and overwhelmed, with the display. Harold was amazed at himself. There was a startling energy, a promptitude and readiness in all his thought, that astonished him. It was inspiration to him. His abruptness of look and language was set off, by an adaptedness of muscle and action, that made him appear to think all over. It was a new study to them that were about him; and his deep, musical voice, without tone or affectation—the strong emphasis of his unqualified, and apparently unchosen language, full of vigour and power, were absolutely thrilling. Whence came these new faculties? He knew not. True, he had often felt in the war council, the loud prompting of a spirit, anxious alike for distinction in the senate, and the field; and twice or thrice, had he, under the sudden and ungovernable excitement, produced by wrong or violence, broke out, in their presence, with what they, the men of the woods, the elder of whom had listened, for half a century, unmoved as their own oaks, to the thundering of their mightiest orators—with what they considered the voice of denunciation and prophecy. They shook in their seats. Their hair rose, and their eyes lightened, as he stood planted before them; his naked arm outstretched, with every muscle quivering, as he pointed to the track of the depredating white men. But then, that was at home—without preparation; for if he had one moment to prepare, his heart withered, and he shrunk appalled, from the fearful undertaking of Eloquence. True, he could debate, and after he had debated with irresistible effect, where no formality or preparation had unsettled or disturbed him, he would quake at the recollection of his own temerity: but then, it was the rashness of a vindictive spirit—now, he was no longer in an Indian council, but standing under a blue canopy, glittering with other lights than those of heaven—in a vast apartment, swarming with beautiful apparitions, and peopled with creatures so heavenly fair, that their very thought seemed transparent. And yet! here, even here, unaccustomed as he was, to the blaze and luxury of fashion and beauty, he was speaking, before he knew it, with such rapidity and effect, in his strong, poetical, and awakening manner, that the priesthood of fashion stood still before him; and he was soon completely environed by eager and palpitating listeners. Was Harold aware of their presence, and accumulation? He did not appear 7* to be—but, having once mounted his chariot, he could not descend, till he had thundered and lightened to his heart's content. He finished, and he started, as from a trance, and the whole room appeared to swim before his eyes—and the tapestry to be all alive with parting lips, as he recovered, and saw how entirely he was the speaker of the assembly. He blushed—faltered—attempted an apology—and his character was instantly established forever! Was ever triumph more complete? One only thing, Harold then wanted, for consummate happiness. The wish was feebly, faintly articulated, but it passed over his fevered heart, like the shadow of something green and cool. What was that wish? It was, that his Indian girl were near! He felt himself growing sick; but struggled and arose. The thought of her would not be dispossessed. It held its place. The lights burnt dim; he heard only a confused ringing, and he put his hand to his forehead, and covered his eyes. `Why?' said he, to himself, `why comes she to my remembrance, now, amid intoxication, and delirium?—sweet, blessed creature! how have I wronged thee!—thy meek, uncomplaining countenance is before me, now. I cannot shut it out. I close my eyes, and cover them with my hands —but thou art still visible—I am glad of it! I love this secret spirituality of our intercourse—no, no!' he added, passionately rising up, utterly forgetful of where he was, and who was looking upon him, and dashing the cold sweat from his forehead—`I have wronged her— but, by the living God! I will atone for it, in blood and tears!' The company withdrew from him, in consternation. The apartment was a solitude. One person only remained—the very lights made the vacancy more melancholy, nay, even more appalling. They shone, as if in some of the self-illuminated mansions of the dead— in silence and immobility—escutcheons and banners, and spears, and rosaries, perhaps around, but all lifeless and motionless. Harold turned deadly pale, for he heard an echo, as he thought, to his own suppressed groaning. It was lady Elvira. She put her hand upon his forehead: and when he lifted his dark, mournful eyes to hers, she fell upon his neck, and wept there. He thanked her, pressed her hand, and arose, with lips strongly compressed, and quivering with convulsion, as if he felt, and would stifle, a mortal agony. His brain whirled. He had been eloquent—but the spell was broken, his subjects scattered, and his dominion gone. He recalled a part of the drama—he saw himself, distinctly, like a disembodied spirit, pass before him!—he shuddered—turned to Elvira, and pointed with his hand. But she saw nothing—nothing! Yet there he was!—the same stately, cold silence—the deep musing of his step—the folded arms, the haughty lip, rebuking, with an inward scorn, the childish hilarity and revelry about him. He saw the apparition of a crowd. They stood awe-struck, before a black shadow that declaimed before them, with a simple and strange motion. He felt, the next moment, something like a cold serpent, sliding over his heart. He was now fronting a group of dancers—he paused, and lifted his foot, as if he had set it, unshod, naked, upon a coiled adder! `Who can he be?—curse his familiar impudence!'— he cried—`let me but reach him, and I will strangle him before her eyes! Gracious heaven! he has taken her hand—nay, I will abide here—he holds it too: holds Elvira's hand, before an assembled multitude!' This spectacle brought him to his senses at once. A tenfold state and solemnity sat upon his brow. He suffered—O! that he did, to the extremity of mortal sufferance; but he was too proud to let any one suspect it —no! though his heart were dissolving in its own agitation. He approached, and attempted to renew the conversation—but his very voice had changed. It was mournful, and deep, and thrilling—but unsustained— he was absent, distressed, and his countenance was ashy pale—but his words were even more composed and steady, than ever. No! no! he could not conceal his agony. His fits of silence, suddenly broken, with a melancholy earnestness to be occupied, and then resumed, as if merely to distract the observation of the company, from himself—there were enough for the youngest and least experienced to judge by. No! no! Harold was a bad player. His distress was visible, immediately, where he least wished it to be, to Elvira, herself. Others saw it, too, but they attributed it to sudden illness—She, alone, of all that were near him, felt and knew the real cause. `I fear, my dear sir—I fear,' said a gentleman that was near, in a tone of the most friendly and affectionate concern—`that you are seriously ill, my young friend.' As he said this, he extended his hand, as if to feel Harold's pulse. Harold bared his wrist, and stretched his arm over the chair, with a smile; but the effort to be cheerful, at such a moment, was worse than all. His eyes filled, in spite of himself: and he was unable to speak for an instant; but it was only for an instant—his soul rose like an abused monarch, and he was himself again!—master of his feelings, his looks, his tones, and his speech; but still, above the affectation of appearing cheerful. He arose to depart. The evening had been, O, how unlike what he had expected—a time of weariness and pain. Yet there was an involutary accompaniment, in all that were near. They felt, and showed in that unequivocal manner, a deep interest in the dark stranger; some had other ways of showing it—some by silence—some by earnestness of look—others, and they were all women, (for men have no such delicacy) by diverting the attention of the company from his distress, and embarrassment. `Farewell!' said Harold, at last, rising abruptly, as if he dared not trust his mind to linger on the thought, and speaking in a low voice to his host, while he bowed to the circle around, without once lifting his eyes to her, the object of all his inquietude. His host pressed his hands in silence. `Colonel! I am sorry—(this was said with uncommon emphasis) to part with you. I am a man of few words. But I expect to see you every day, while you are here. My carriage is at the door.' Harold bowed, and was soon in his own apartment— ignorant almost by what magick, the removal had been made so quickly and silently, for he had heard nothing, seen nothing, as they thundered along the streets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Behold Harold now in his room—his head resting upon his hands—a tear! can it be possible?—a tear trickling through his fingers. Verily, the Indian must be broken in spirit! Hark! that is the pulsation of his heart—and that—listen! that is his breathing, so almost articulate, as if he were suffocating in his sleep. `Where am I?' he cries, striking the table with his hand—`what have I done? Am I mad? Yes, I am— mad, mad, beyond the reach of palliation, or excuse. He could not have been a lover—he is not—by heaven, he is not! woe to him, if he be! People that love, do not show it so openly, at least, in publick. And yet, damn it, he cannot be a relation; relations do not yearn for such familiarities—her hand held in his, unresistingly— pshaw! who cares for her hand now? Once, it was distinction, to touch it—shame, shame, on her! base, unfeeling woman!' `But * * but—what am I?—I!—can I complain? Where is my fidelity? Loena!—O, thou art bitterly avenged. This is jealousy, devouring jealousy— feeding like a serpent upon my brain. Who is he? No matter. Brother, lover, friend—it has taught me one lesson. I have been a scoundrel! Heaven forgive me! I repent, deeply repent. Loena! love! living or dead, thy triumph is now complete! I am thine, and thine alone; mine only love, my dark-eyed Indian girl.' Yes! the conquest was now complete. Harold was now firm of heart. Nothing could shake him. Once determined, he was forever immovable. Composed by this resolution, self-sustained, and self-restored, He slept this night a more refreshing sleep than he had, since he met lady Elvira on board the vessel. And this night, for his reward, he dreamt that he held her whom he did love, though for a while he had forgotten, in the drunken exhilaration of his spirit, her and himself, to his heart; and felt her bosom throb against his, in purity and love, in timidity and passion, of purity in its perfection, and love in its sublimity. He was awakened, in broad day, from a blissful dream, in which he had recapitulated all, all of his transgressions to her, and been forgiven, and blessed— by a servant, who handed him a note. It was as follows: `I was distressed at your conduct last evening: we go into the country after dinner, and we expect you to go with us. Before, or on the way, if I have an opportunity, I shall speak of some occurrences that have taken place.' Was such a note to be disregarded? No, surely not. And Harold, of course, was again by the side of Elvira. Not, however, the feeble and irresolute creature that he may seem for awhile; but he was there. She never appeared more captivating, more majestick. Her blandishments were, what few could resist, but yet, Harold, whose spirit was now in armour, did resist them. He had been told, and he delighted to repeat it—Beware of precipitate promises, beware of rash resolutions—Be slow to resolve, but speedy to execute. But having once made a resolution, (as he now had to overcome his attachment to Elvira, for Loena's sake,) whatever it be, keep it—keep it, for life and death. Was it weak, rash, precipitate? keep it and punish yourself. It will teach you more caution and wisdom. Not so, if you could set yourself free from it, when you pleased. You would then, never be wise. Besides, it takes away all dignity from your resolutions and promises, if you are known ever to break them, under any pretence. Do you fear a change? Then learn to make them conditional. Such was Harold's reasoning, and, therefore, it was his way, nay it was his religion, to keep his promises, good or bad. Was this right? Harold had persuaded himself that it was. But he was asked, `Suppose you had promised to kill a man, would you kill him?' `Assuredly,' was his reply. They, that heard him, shuddered. They forgot to ask, if he would ever promise to kill a man. That he would never do, even in a passion. Why? Because, experience had made him wary. He was careful not to promise, because, he knew that he must pay the penalty of his wickedness and folly, by performance. Others might commit murder in their hearts, threaten, and lie, and repent. He did not. They were contemptible. He, at the worst, was only wicked. `I have much to communicate to you,' said lady Elvira, in an impressive tone, as she seated herself by his side. `Be prepared for something that will try you. Do you know who you are—your parentage?' `Yes,' said Harold proudly, `a Logan.' `But your father?' `An adopted Logan.' `But have you no curiosity! He was a white, an Englishman.” `Tant pis,' said Harold, half smiling in scorn, and mockery. `Harold,' said Elvira, reproachfully, `Harold, you do not wish to hurt my feelings, I hope.' `A white!' said he, laying his hand upon her shoulder, and looking her full in the face, `Yes, Elvira, he was, but in appearance only, not in heart.' `Do you know that he was an Englishman?' `Yes, from what you told me—in no other way. I never asked. I care not who, or what he was. All white men were alike to me, (men, I speak of,) treacherous, cowardly, cruel: all countries were alike, where they dwelt, the abode of wickedness and tyranny.' `Patience, Harold, patience. Why what has taken possession of thee, so on a sudden. Come, come, be more temperate; remember, we are not in America now. Let us talk this matter over calmly. You have come here providentially. You are young, nameless, friendless— hush, dont interrupt me, in the estimation of men, you are so. Now prepare yourself, be composed. What would you say, were I to tell you that your father was a nobleman?' `Say!—nothing, except that I was sorry for it.' —`That you have relations still living—' `Gracious heaven! I! Where, lady, where?' `Oh, I thought that I should disturb your apathy. But remember your promise. Be firm. We shall see some within another hour—you have a sister.' `A sister!' cried Harold, leaping upon his feet, and seizing her hand, with the most impassioned earnestness—`Lady! on thy soul, do not trifle with me—have I a sister! O, my God, my God! Yes, dear Elvira. I will believe thee, I must; thy countenance is too solemn, for a doubt—a sister! O my heart is yearning to pour out its gathered fountains of tenderness. Where is she? O, tell me, dear, dear woman! How passionately I long to find some living creature related to me—a sister! O, how I shall doat upon her! I shall lavish all these inexhaustible stores of affection upon her—all these, that have been accumulating ever since my birth, in darkness, desolation, and loneliness. Their seals shall be melted—but no! no, no—it cannot be. Thou wouldst not mock me—but, nay, forgive me, I have no sister, I can have none. My mother died, and my brothers, and my sisters, all, all! in flame and blood! I alone escaped. I feel it, I know it. The dream is passed, my heart is cold again. I am alone again. No living creature is related to me—alone, alone!' He covered his face, and sank into a chair. `No Harold, believe me. I do not speak unadvisedly, I have the proof. Thou hast a sister—another child of thine own father, but not the child of thy mother; one whom thou wilt love, Ah how devotedly! Yea, more— perhaps thou hast a brother (her voice faltered)—it is possible; but of him there is a melancholy tale to tell. Rank and fortune are within thy reach, dependent, however, in some measure, upon the certainty of his fate. You do not comprehend. You are bewildered; but, there are the papers, (as she said this, she opened a secretary, and handed him a bundle; and Harold fancied, that she turned deadly pale, as she touched them, and that she approached them, with a strange reluctance, nay even with terrour.) `The governour knew the whole, as I have before told thee, and when he died, he gave me a part of these papers, with his own hand, bidding me interest my friends, who are powerful here, in your behalf. Nay, do not interrupt me—I have obeyed him. I have succeeded. I have invoked his spirit to thine aid, and it appeared. To its prompting I have yielded. We shall take council, and proceed thoughtfully in the business. Some years may pass, before you are acknowledged. But, in the mean time, you are young, ardent, ambitious, and resolute, with the alphabet of greatness already at your command; but you want discipline, system, time and experience. You must prepare yourself, Harold, for playing no second part in the great drama of life. What say you? will you, can you devote five years, with all your heart and soul, to solitary study?— toil, night and day, for distinction?—forget all your early habits? and tie your spirit down, hand and foot, to it? If you will only say that you will do this, we will believe you, we know that you can; and we, I am authorised to say this, we will give you elevation, riches, and opportunity to be what you please. What say you? We want your promise. That is enough for us, for we know you. Five years may seem long; but we do not press you to an immediate decision; we do not even attempt to influence you. Take your own time for consideration. But no shorter probation will do for us. There is much for you to do. To do it well, you must have consummate experience and self-collectedness. The time appointed is short enough. You are thunderstruck; but I am obliged to adopt this manner toward you now. We must forget all that has passed. Henceforth, there must be no allusion to it; on your future conduct alone, do we rely. Read those papers, when you have recovered your composure. You will have need of much to support you. There is a stupendous mystery concealed within them. Perhaps your self-love may be wounded; but that will soon pass away. You are, naturally, too great a man to be afflicted long with such weaknesses. No, you need not look thus. I do not flatter you, you know that I do not. I never did. I never will. Among them, you will find two miniatures, one of your sister, and one of your brother. O, you are roused, I perceive! Well, well, you may look at them a moment—but dont tear the VOL. I. 8 papers open so furiously—there!—see what you have done!' Harold tore open the bundle, and soon discovered the miniatures, and pressed the first, without looking at it, to his lips—his eyes filled—he wiped them and looked at it —he wiped them again— `My sister! that my sister!' he cried, in a tone of unutterable horrour. He groaned aloud: the picture fell from his hand, and he sat staring at Elvira, his noble countenance full of preternatural vacancy and terrour. It was the picture of Elvira herself. She shrieked aloud, at his aspect. His eyes were motionless, and, as her hand approached him, he shuddered, and shrank from her, and his knees smote together. `In the name of heaven! what ails thee Harold, dear Harold?' she said; but he gave no answer; he only covered his ears with his hands, as if he had gone raving mad, at the sound of her voice. Her eyes fell upon the picture. She took it up. She was amazed. `Merciful providence!' she exclaimed, how came it there! It was shivered and bloody when I saw it last! It was upon his bosom. Who can have had it! Whence came it?' She began searching, with hands that shook so as to prevent her from untying the ribbands, and she was obliged to tear them asunder, breaking seals and all. She soon found a third miniature. `There, Harold, there! dear, dear Harold. Look at that—that is thy sister—poor girl. No wonder thou wast death-struck. Harold! Harold! rouse thee!' She held the miniature to his eyes—they shut involuntarily; she shook him; and, at last, a deep sigh burst from his labouring heart; he attempted to rise, and walk, but he did not appear to feel the floor; his joints yielded, and he fell. `Where am I?' said he, putting his hand faintly to his forehead, upon which the thick clammy moisture of death was standing, `where am I? lady!—Who art thou? Why am I pinioned thus. I knew it not. No, by my hopes of salvation! No! What have I done? I know not. Speak to me, lady, hast thou any compassion upon a dying man? Thou hast—thy tears, bless thee lady! I am not then utterly reprobate. That picture—take it away—there is one exactly like it, hot, hot, burning in my brain; put thy hand here lady, here!—dost thou not feel it—Ah!' Elvira wept over him, soothed him; and after a while, ventured to repeat the name of sister. His lips quivered a little. She then produced the picture, the true picture. He appeared to recover. The wildness, and fixedness of his look departed. He pressed her hand, and arose, and sat down by her, upon the sofa— still partially bewildered. He was holding the miniature of his sister now in his hand. He looked at it—brought it nearer, and then turning, with a melancholy smile to Elvira, he said, `pray tell me, lady, Elvira, what has happened to me? Have I been sick? The last that I can recollect is, that—pray is this the portrait of my dear sister—what is her name? `It is—her name is Caroline.' `Well, I could weep heartily over it. Do you know that just now, when I first took it into my hands, its countenance appeared to change—yes change!—aye, Elvira, I protest to thee, that it looked for a moment like thee. What a strange delusion! I fear that I am not well, my temples are sore; there is an odd, whirling sensation in my head; and I remember that it grew suddenly dark about me, when the face changed. What did I say?— Have I had a fit? Surely,—lady, look at me—what has happened?—Thou hast been weeping.' `No matter now—' said the delighted woman, `all is well now—' `What a heavenly countenance!' cried Harold, poring devoutly over the beautiful picture, `such serene dark eyes? What colour are they?—not blue surely—' `No—I hardly know what they are—I only know that I have mistaken them, at night, for black, when she was a child, and that they were always exceedingly beautiful.' `How smooth and high the forehead!—the blue veins rippling over it—like delicate stains over the transparent leaf of a magnolia—how beautifully arched—her eye-brows! and yet straight enough for dignity and expression. O, what sweetness and purity! what intelligence—love her!—O, I love her already, as if we had been a thousand years acquainted. But come, let us see my brother, ha! ha! ha!' `What do you laugh at, Harold? `Ha! ha! ha! I am thinking of the strange sensations that I just had. It appears to me that I have lost my memory. I have heard of shocks, apoplectick, I believe they call them. Perhaps this was one—' `What! Harold. You amaze me. You cannot surely laugh at such an event.' O, no. not at that, but I laugh at—wasn't it very strange, dear, that I should think this face looked like thine, and yet I did—I protest to thee, that I thought it exactly like thee. But, while I was looking at it, it changed—indeed it did?' While he was speaking, he took the other miniature from the hand of Elvira, who appeared unable either to look at it or relinquish it. He turned his eyes to it —he appeared bewildered for a moment—he put his hand to his forehead—he held the picture at different lengths, now afar off, and now near, with a continually increasing astonishment, now shutting his eyes, and now turning them off, as if unwilling to believe his senses— `By heaven, and all its angels!' he cried, at last, in a loud voice, springing from his seat, `it is he!' `Lady—is that—that!—(the picture dropped from his hands into her lap,) is that the picture of my brother? The brother of Caroline, the sweet Caroline?' `Again, Harold!—you alarm me. Another paroxysm—' `O, Oscar! Oscar,' cried the agitated Indian, `O, would that I had known thee! Thou fierce and implacable spirit, would that I had known thee!' Elvira stood apalled at his convulsive agitation. His voice rung through and through her brain. `Oscar! she echoed, `who hath dared to pronounce thy name, before my presence? Oscar!—O, let my malediction —' `Forbear! forbear!' cried Harold, plucking down her agitated hands. She obeyed, and they sat down, unwillingly, as if they had no power to support themselves, or resist some outward pressure; as if their very bones were made of wax—unwillingly, and in silence. Harold told her when, and where, he had met the original of the picture. She was stupified with astonishment. She could not believe him. It was impossible— impossible!' she said, vehemently, `on board of the same vessel, with me, and I not know it! Oh no! Harold, by my hope of salvation, I do tell thee that it could not be; I should have felt Oscar's presence thrilling my very blood, had he been so near me.' `Stay,' said Harold, `perhaps this will assure thee.' He opened a little folded pocketbook, and took out some scraps of paper with an agitated hand. `I found these,' said he, `upon the deck, after he left me; I saw him throw away a handful of paper, but the wind blew a part of them back to us. Do you know the handwriting?' `Alas! it is true, true,' she answered, in a broken voice, `but stay,' (she began to read here, and the colour came and went, with terrifying rapidity over her face,) `O yes! yes!' she cried, clasping and lifting her blue eyes to heaven—Father! thy will be done! It was he, he himself!' A part seemed to be in a female hand; but there were marginal notes in another character. Harold attempted to read them again, and succeeded in decyphering a few legible sentences. — — thy destiny!—what knowest thou of thy destiny? — — Infatuated man! —A murderer—the slayer too of thy sister — — — O, Oscar! Oscar! — defend suicide!— To this was the following note: `Yes!—I do defend it. What right hath any one to bid me live? Who cares for Oscar? May I not, at my own free will and pleasure, risk my life and limbs, in charity, battle, or adventure? Then have I a property in them—but—' 8 * `That I have loved thee (was written in the former character)—passionately, I do not pretend to deny. That I no longer love thee, I will not attempt to say. It would be false, if I did. No, Oscar, I do love thee, I shall love thee to my dying day—But — — — — I dread thee — More to be feared than beloved. — — Who would dare to couple her fate with thine? — — — — — — — — Hast thou not — said that it was perilous — — and when I told thee what she said, didst thou not reply, and tell me, yes, yes! it is too true. She is thy best friend — She does not wrong me. Thy courage is terrible—to think of marrying one like me — — Didst thou not? — — — And when I have seen thy rivetted brows —thine intensely bright eyes fixed, in deadly wrath, upon some other eye—and heard thy suppressed, but terrible voice, denouncing some one, upon whom it seemed to fall, syllable by syllable, like a curse—did I not tremble—joint and marrow—and can I love thee? O, Oscar! — — — farewell! farewell forever! — — — — — Hast thou — forgotten that night? O never shall I forget it?—thine unhallowed trespass—thy strange levity—thy suffocation—agony—thy brief repentance—O Oscar!—Thy convulsive sobs—I hear them yet?—thy hot tears—I feel them yet—my heart was blistered as they fell. — — — — and yet, I forgave thee!—Is it forgotten? Was not that a proof of my love, unbounded, and impassioned as thine own? — — — —No, no, it is all over now. — farewell forever! — Repent, repent, I conjure thee. A murderer thou art already—a madman perhaps—but O, Oscar, O my beloved, thou, whom I must never see again. Oh, put not the seal of blood and death, forever and ever, to thy consummate guilt—O, be not, I conjure thee, thou most wayward, and desperate man, be not a self murderer' — — — — farewell. — — — — — To this was a note also, in the following words— `No, no. She did not, I should have worshipped thee —did I ever aught—said I ever aught, unkindly to thee, woman? No, never, never! I should have died over and over again, without one look of reproach, or coldness —nay—have I not been dying—and loved thee yet. Was not my heart bursting more than once, and did I ever wrong thee. — — — — A murderer!—no—I am a martyr.' — — The tears fell fast from the beautiful eyes of Elvira, as she assisted, in assembling the fragments, and decyphering them, which she did, with an avidity and readiness, that Harold afterwards thought extraordinary. `That was thy brother, Harold,' said she, as he deposited them again in his pocket-book, `thine own brother; and never walked there, upon this earth, a more god-like spirit. May God forgive him! The fine gold became dim, clouded; with a profane foot, and a desperate hand, he plucked down the image of his Maker, from the place of his sacrifice, and put up a man in armour, reeking with blood—a creature whom he called Ambition. But, he is gone, gone, with all his colossal attributes and transgressions—O, may it be that he went, as thou thinkest, in a delirium, insensible to the awful weight of his obligation to the Eternal!' `These papers,' she added, laying her hand, with a convulsive shudder, upon a part of the bundle, which was tied with a blue ribband, stiffened and discoloured, `relate to his life. They were tied with his own hands. They have never been untied since. That ribband is wet with the heart's blood of an enemy—one whom he slew, before his own family altar, in the very presence of his household gods!—Read them. Beware. Thou art fashioned like him, Harold, and the lesson should sink deep, very deep, into thy soul.' Harold was chilled to the heart. There was something so awful and admonitory in her voice. `But who art thou, lady?—who, and whence?—that seemest to have been so familiar with my brother's transgressions.' `No matter,' she replied with dignity—`no matter. Remember mine admonitions, as thou wouldst prosper. Watch thy temper. Crucify thy pride. Trample to the earth thine arrogant, overbearing spirit—O Harold, I beseech thee, as I have besought him, with a sore heart, aching and trembling with prayer for ye both—Be a good man.' She was upon her knees. All at once, a light broke in upon him. He caught out his pocket-book again, and examined the writing of the female.—It was not to be mistaken!—he was breathless. `Lady Elvira—have I not heard thee pronounce the name of Oscar before—even in America!' She covered her face with her hands. `O, now I see it, all! noble, excellent creature! I see it, all! I feel it, all!—my sister—beloved of my brother —thou, who didst abandon—but dost lament my brother—heaven bless thee!'—He embraced her, and mingled his tears with hers. Their silence was interrupted, by the entrance of a servant, to announce that the carriage was drawn up, and Mr. Hammond waiting: once more, then, they joined hands, like a brother and sister, and soon came in sight of several beautiful cottages, near a large mansion, upon a hill. It was visible, like a bright spot, in a wide amphitheatre of glowing verdure, long before they were near it. The hand of Elvira was upon Harold's arm; and already had he learnt somewhat of the feelings that are fraternal—his passionate, tumultuous, overwrought sensations were chiefly allayed, or assuaged; and now, he was doubly thankful that he had thus anticipated, as it seemed, the resolution of Elvira,—and taught his heart a new lesson of constancy, while it was yet apparently in his power to be inconstant. Such is ever the reward of virtuous resolution. `That cottage,' said Elvira, as they turned the corner of a narrow road, over which, two rows of aged elms—interwove their dark and irregular branches, forming a tangled and broken canopy, through which bright glimpses of the sky were caught, looking as if the whole heaven were one mirrour, with parts of the quicksilver, here and there, rubbed off.—`That cottage' —they caught another view of it—her lips moved—but no sound followed. Harold understood the silent pressure of her hand upon his arm—but he, too, could not utter a word; his heart was too full. It seemed a profanation to speak aloud, in such a scene, so still, so beautiful, so serene! `But,' said the stately old man that accompanied them, `you ought to be more fully apprised, than I believe you are, of whom you are to meet.' Harold, who had begun to endure the scrutiny of his eyes with tolerable composure, bowed in silence. It was irksome to be interrupted at such a moment, with the matters of the world—and insufferably so, if not impious, he thought, to touch upon lighter affairs, in a season of such religious beauty. The fine countenance of the old man was illuminated with a most benignant smile, as he observed the imploring of Harold's eye, when he bowed his assent; and still more was he pleased, when Harold, as he began, threw himself back in his seat, pulled his hat over his eyes, as if to hide his emotion, and sat, with his arms folded, listening to what affected him so thrillingly. `You are a Cumberland,' said Mr. Hammond. `Your father was George Clarence of Salisbury, third son of the last Cumberland. He held a seignory in his own right: the family were wealthy—but your father was an extraordinary man—he loved and was beloved—he had rivals among the blood royal—princes—Enough for the present. His ungovernable ambition led him to America. You are henceforth to assume the name.—If you choose to retain your commission, which seems to be a somewhat questionable one, to say nothing of its danger—you will be colonel Cumberland; or, if you will indulge us so far, we will delight to recognize you as Harold of Salisbury. Your sister is known as Caroline, of Salisbury—Cumberland is the family name, to be worn or not, at pleasure. We cannot invest you with your rights immediately, but we can put you in the way of living like a gentleman, and of occupying the place, to which it is probable, that heaven has destined you—if you deserve it—a place of authority and power. I am not at liberty to speak more plainly now. In the mean time, I do trust, young man (this was said in a manner strikingly solemn and impressive) that you are not forgetful of your acknowledgments—no, no—I do not mean that. You do not understand me. I do not mean gratitude of so earthly a character—nor does she, I am sure. Your cheek burns—it is a good symptom, at the slightest impeachment of your gratitude, for the favours and indulgences of your earthly friend—but— remember my words. I would have them engraven on thy heart. They are the essence of all that I have learnt, all that I can teach thee, and I am now three score and ten.—Remember thy Creator.' Harold felt the rebuke. His heart rose in his throat. He could have thrown himself into the old man's arms —as a son, into those of a father—but he dared not. There was so much sublimity—something so serene and benignant, so dignified and amiable, in the countenance before him, that he felt, for the first time, the reverential emotions of awe and love, at the same moment, flooding his heart, and rising to his eyes:—that tribute which they, who are not utterly forsaken and reprobate, involuntarily pay to the aged and good—the truly religious and venerable—for the old seem to stand as especial monuments of divine pleasure—living beyond their allotted term, almost by a continually repeated miracle. It is, for we all feel it more or less, the homage that vice itself cannot withhold from virtue. In the presence of a religious man, one who has been sorely tried and perplexed, during many generations with the doings of Providence, and yet stands upright and smiling under his gray, thin hair, we seem to breathe the same air with him, who has long held a communion, which we are too undeserving, or too thoughtless to desire, with his Father in heaven—Jehovah—the living God!—Is there not—I appeal to thee, reader—is there not somewhat purifying and exalting in the thought?—to meet a fellow creature, just rising perhaps, from a conversation with the Deity—is it not as if we were one of the men of Israel, that saw the lawgiver descend from the mountain, where he had been, while it smoked and thundered with the everlasting presence.—There is—and Harold felt it. Harold was constituted of such materials as martyrs are compounded from. But, like others, his visitations were forgotten. Whatever kindness came unexpectedly to him, he was grateful for: but his gratitude diminished, as the cause increased. He seemed thankful for nothing that was habitual and familiar to him; to grow insensible of aught but special favours, and to become weary, even of acknowledgment. Nay worse—even the cold, lifeless, habitual exercise of devotion, became inexpressibly irksome, and dissatisfactory to him, (for while he felt it so, his heart reproached him for it;) if heaven were indulgent, for any continued time, to his infirmities and wants. From his very boyhood, any unexpected incident, seeming like kindness, in Him who is habitually kind, in things where we are most insensible—good fortune, no matter of what nature—an escape from a precipice, or a wild beast—the meeting of one that he loved, would prostrate him upon his face, in the dim solitude, and he would pray, as the children of nature always do pray, in breathless and awful silence, pouring out his very heart in thankfulness. But, in adversity—in calamity, Harold was apt to forget his God; to rely upon himself alone. To pray then, seemed to him, in his strange language, like coaxing his Maker. `He knows what is best for me— is unchangeable, and why need I importune him?' Harold was young yet—thoughtless, and obstinate. He knew not then, for he had never asked himself the question, that a father may appoint some mode of application, for his child to pursue in his petitioning, even when he knows every of its wants, and has already resolved upon his course. Prayer is the appointed medium, (this is no cant, reader—I am not, and never was, what people call a religious man—still less am I a sectarian—I belong to no sect, no creed—I am neither Jew nor Turk, Christian nor Mahometan—all my religion consists in the belief of one supreme Being, to whom we are all accountable—and that, if we do as we would be done by, it is all that He requires—for man to show his dependence upon, submission to, and confidence in, his heavenly Father. But, let us return. Harold was none of those that suffer their conscience to repeat their condemnation, over and over again. No! And when that monitor once stood up, she was recognized and acknowledged, if her countenance were solemn, and her port princely. On this occasion he felt that he had been forgetful of his kindest benefactor, his truest friend, and he determined, on the spot, no longer to stifle the natural gushings of an affectionate spirit, toward that good and great Being. Here began the reformation, the radical and thorough reformation of Harold. His heart was sore with its own effort to purify itself, and had been so, for a long while; but never had he seriously and solemnly undertaken to cleanse it of all impurity and wickedness till now. His first step was his self-denial respecting Elvira; that accomplished, all others were easy in comparison. It is with virtuous as with vicious resolves, each hour's acquaintance with one, makes us fitter to be acquainted with another. Every act, of either character, is but the link of a long chain, which by a propensity of our nature, easily perverted, we seem determined to carry—and every link that is lifted, renders the remainder easier and lighter to be borne. A few bright thoughts, like angels busy on messages of mercy, passed rapidly through his brain, during this short ride, and purified and illuminated it, with the speed and effect of lightning. He was a better and wiser man, from that moment. The scales fell from his eyes. Thus, a casual movement of the waters, had tempted him to go down and wash, and be well, when they might have been troubled forever, more violently, without affecting him. A slight reproof, apparently accidental, though not truly so, (for the old man was a being of that provident benignity, which will not obtrude its kindness or admonition unreasonably,) had done more than much entreaty, great inquietude, with severe disappointment, travail, weariness and affliction had ever done for him. He lifted his eyes to those of Mr. Hammond, to thank him, but was startled at a new, yet strangely familiar expression in his face. `Surely,' said he, almost audibly, `I have seen that face before.' Elvira heard his voice, and asked the reason of his astonishment. He repeated his remark with an air of singular perplexity. `Do you not remember the little man of the woods—your familiar—you are amazed, I perceive. He is a relation of your guardian here, I find—and, accompanied your father to America. He returned with us in the same vessel, without my knowledge, until a few days before our arrival, when he made himself known to me, and commanded me, in his strangely imperious way, not to inform thee. He appears to be strongly attached to you, Harold—but I must apprise you that he has been delirious at times, and that he prophecies much evil against you. You smile—but he says that you shall die a violent and sudden death; and bids you be prepared for it, declaring that he is commissioned to tell you so. Nay, do not look so very serious—some impression I should wish it to make, but it would be weakness to let it disturb you.' `He is commissioned,' said Harold, solemnly. The mansion was again in sight; for they seemed to have been travelling round and round it, without approaching, for a whole hour. Harold had kept his eye upon it for some time, watching it, as the carriage gradually rose and sunk, in the undulating and circuitous road, by which they wound up the beautiful hill upon which it was built. The cottages about, were literally embosomed in greenness, and encumbered, roof and lattice, with a profusion of brilliant wild flowers, shrubs and vines. Far to the left was a clump of disordered, broken, and decayed trees, from whose remains the mouldering bark was, here and there peeled off, leaving the wood beneath of an intensely white appearance, in patches and stripes—and these were all hung around with the brightest verdure—newly sprouted, of a most VOL. II. 9 luxuriant growth; damp and glittering, in garlands, and tresses, and bunches;—so exceedingly fantastick, and vivid, and beautiful, as to seem the sport of the mischievous creatures, that delight in mocking at decay and ruin, and busy themselves in burying dirt and rubbish, under a vegetation of tenfold brilliancy and richness. From this spot, there commenced, and ran entirely over the hill, in a waving line, a mass of shrubbery, chiefly in flower, and changeable with all the varieties of purple, yellow, white and green, here and there intermixed with some delicate trees, that, shooting up with a lone, bewildered aspect, from the flowers below, and spouting, at the termination of the limbs, in gushes of clustered foliage, vivid as emerald, and changeable all over, as the wind blew upon them, like bunches of coloured feathers—and looking, at a distance, where the branches, which were often exceedingly slender, could not be seen, like something afloat in the air, motionless in general, but incessantly active at times. A sheet of water lay below—far, far below, shadowed, on one side, by an irregular entrenchment of young willows, that gave the very depth a tinge of green—till it looked, all about, like floating herbage:— a dark cloud hung over another part, blackening it to the far shore—while, over the other side, the waves were rippling in the light of a setting sun, now brilliant as a sheet of flame, and now, as the faint wind went slowly over it, resembling an agitated mass of clouded gold,—while the wavy outline of shadow was confined by a broad halo of ruddy and sparkling light—and sprinkled all over with white and blue pond lilies, drifting in ambuscade under their green leaves. A thunder shower had just passed off, and there was a transparency in all the green things about, surpassing all that Harold had ever seen. The foliage looked, or at least so Harold loved to conceit, as if it were thankful for having been newly washed from the dust, and gave out its beauty and freshness, as an offering to Him, who had just purified the air and earth. At the extreme north of the sky, directly in the centre of a perfectly black cloud, which overhung the water, shadowing it to the very bottom, as could be seen from the high hill that overlooked it, like a pile of huge and broken rock, rampart and parapet—there was a part, and only a part, of a broad and beautiful rainbow, of the most brilliant tinting, to be seen. It appeared to be a solid column of coloured spar—a pillar of fire and crystalization. It shone, as if inlaid, in the very blackest part of the cloud, and terminated abruptly; not as rainbows generally do, in a fading and aerial tint, that defies you to say where the splendid arching hath ceased:—a little higher up, it could be traced again in a brighter part of the sky, after the eye had been long searching for it, by a faint, delicate gleaming of rose colour and gold, much narrower than the base in the shadow, and resembling, from the tendency of the sweep, another rainbow. Add to all this picture, which is no creature of the fancy, the variety of verdure and hue—the nearer leaves, in the fore-ground, shining and dancing in the wind, like coloured ising-glass—the farther ones, of a bluer and graver aspect and movement, and all finely dying away, on the one side, in a glowing sunset, and on the other, under a preternatural darkness. On the very verge of the horizon, the village steeple shot up, like a white steady flame, into the blue air; and just by the bend in the pond, a fort had been erected, from which floated a broad banner of many colours, upon the wind, with a singularly cheerful effect. The smoke too, from the little hamlet of white, nestling cottages, was beautiful, just emerging from the chimneys, and running along, almost in a straight line upon the damp atmosphere, with a density and whiteness, made remarkable, at this time, from the deep green and blue of the far landscape, and the black sky beyond. Harold had the eye of a painter, although he could not paint; the heart and soul of a poet, although he held, to his dying day, that it was no proof of ardent, pure, or natural feeling, nay, nor of religious feeling, to talk over your raptures, at such a moment, either in verse or prose. No!—the heart swells and swells—the wing mounts, and there is a sanctity in your loneliness, which language or sound, even of musick, breaks in upon, like some unholy visitant—it is, like the feeling of first love, when the loving and beloved wander together, for the first time, in the starlight—too happy, far too happy— to talk, with just enough of life to press each others' hands with full eyes, and fuller hearts. Harold was startled from his reverie, by the stopping of the carriage. Reader, let us stop with him. The old man's eyes were yet upon his countenance, with a smile of complacency, as if he understood and approved his meditations. Harold offered to assist Elvira—she was deadly pale, spoke not, but gave him her cold hand, and alighted. A moment more, and a slight, beautiful form flashed down the avenue, broke through the trees, and was instantly pressed to Elvira's heart. Elvira whispered something to her, and then gently led her to Harold. `Are you prepared, my dear Caroline,' said she, `to welcome your new brother?' Caroline raised her sweet, clear, timid, innocent eyes; and Harold dropped upon his knees before her. `My brother!'—said she, in a voice hardly audible, `my dear brother!' `Thy brother! dearest! O, yes, I am thy brother! I feel it here—and here—all over, in every artery and pulse.' He arose and embraced her, holding her to his desolate heart, as if all that earth contained dear to him, was then within the circumference of his arms. Elvira stood near, contemplating the scene with a mixture of delight and sorrow; her look was that of one who rejoices in the happiness of others, even while the sight of it brings back many melancholy, and some deadly recollections. Our party were soon in the house, and every servant, old or young, soon discovered something to be done in the very room where they were. Some, with sidelong look and averted faces, were adjusting the vines, at the long window shutters, directly fronting Harold, although they were in the nicest order, because next the road—while others, which were behind him, were utterly neglected, although in need of all their attention. Harold observed all this, and felt an innocent gratification in detecting the artifice. Every face looked kindly upon him; but he was more especially gratified, when a decrepid old woman, of amazing vivacity and almost blind, stood before him. She trembled all over at the touch of his hand, and when he spoke, she uttered a faint cry. `A Cumberland! a Cumberland!—aye, go where ye will, the world over, ye would know one of the blood, by his voice. Were I blind and deaf, I could tell him —yes, that I could, (running as she said this, her trembling, withered, little hand, over his high forehead, and peering closely in his face)—by the touch alone. Very dark—very dark, but masculine'—She stopped abruptly. `Young man,' said she, `my master—Salisbury— Cumberland—Harold, or whatever may be thy name, God is good. Remember him. Mayest thou have all the virtues of thy blood—none of its follies!' `Follies, dame,' said Mr. Hammond, `speak plainly to the young man. This is no time for mincing matters.' `Well then, if it please your worship, vices. Remember thy father—thy brother—do thou rightly, as thou wouldst shun their sorrow. O, heaven have mercy on them both! They were noble creatures!' `Dame!' replied his worship with solemnity. `It is false—false!—They were not noble. Great qualities they had, but them they perverted, polluted, degraded, trampled in the dust. No! they were ignoble, for they were wicked.' `Sir,' cried Harold, respectfully—`Spare me. I am, as I now find, a son, a brother. Whatever may have been their transgressions, now surely is not the time to rake among their ashes.' Caroline lifted her soft eyes to him, so meekly, that he could hardly refrain from kissing them. They were wet—and as she did so, she leaned somewhat more 9* confidingly upon his arm. Her terrour,—a feeling that Harold was very apt to excite at first, by his stern expression, and erect, imperious carriage, was fast melting away, before the thought of the affectionate girl. He put his lips to her white forehead; and it crimsoned all over, like a flash of red fire—her very neck and bosom grew ruddy too. Harold's eyes sparkled with pleasure. So innocent too! said he, and so lovely. But loveliness, and innocence, and purity, cannot be separated. Mr. Hammond turned a look of approbation upon him, and was silent; not, it was evident, that he was intimidated by Harold's reply, or sorry, or exhausted, but merely because he had said all that the occasion seemed to require. He never lost an opportunity of this sort. He always rose to reprove the unthinking, when, dazzled and confounded by some magnificent criminal, they lifted up their voices in his defence. He had lived long, he used to say, and he had seen more evil principle, more wretched paradox, gain a seat and an abiding place in the hearts of society, by the unprincipled or thoughtless approbation of high talent, or enthusiastick tempers, than from any other cause. He looked to the goodness of a man, as the only standard of his greatness: and he stood, like a giant, in his denunciation of them that dared to hold up greatness as distinct from goodness. `No!' he cried, `the simplest, humblest act, of the humblest human creature, is really greater, if it make a fellow creature wiser or happier, than any deed, though it convulse an empire to its foundations, and shake the four corners of the earth with the noise of its trumpeting.' Such was his doctrine. The sadness of lady Elvira now became painful to all. She observed it, and knowing her own power, either to cloud or brighten whatever she approached, she strove to recover her self-possession; but, the effort was too distressing, and why should she make it? was she not among them that loved her? them that were indulgent, and kind-hearted? yet, she was repeating the attempt, when a harp suddenly sounded in the apartment above, like the snapping of a chord—she started from her seat, and an involuntary exclamation of terrour broke from her lips—and even Caroline, Harold thought, looked paler than usual; but, unacquainted as he was, with the delicate proprieties of life, he had an instinctive and quick perception of what is proper on such occasions, and therefore took no notice of the sound, nor of the emotion and dismay that it seemed to have caused. After a few moments' conversation, Mr. Hammond took his arm, and led him out upon the lawn, in silence. The clouds were passing away. Over one part of the sky, however, there still hung a portentous and strange darkness, while the other was of the deepest and most luminous blue, apparently solid, like a vault of sapphire, with the star light shooting out of it, into the dimness of their uplifted eyes, like rays from a broken diamond. `What a sky!' cried Mr. Hammond. `Almighty Father! this is the work of thy hands.' These were the thoughts of a man, in his simplicity and strength. These were the aspirations of true religion. In exclamations like these, so fervent, and unpremeditated, Harold, who knew little and cared less, for all the artificial distinctions of men, could mingle all the immortality of his nature. His bible he had read, but not as a critick—not as a theologian—not as a votary of science—no, but, as one who was affected by its simplicity, and uplifted by the sublime walking of its spirit. No!—but he read his bible, when he read it, which, it is true, was not often, and loved it, as a book containing all that was needful for the government and instruction of man, whether in sorrow or suffering, or throned and sceptred. That he was perplexed with parts—disturbed by parts—he did not deny; but he found all that was necessary for his happiness, here and hereafter, so plain, so beautifully plain, and simple, that he could not misunderstand it. As for the meaning of heresy and heterodoxy, and orthodoxy, he cared nothing. They were but other names to express what the bible did not—the infallibility of man. No!— exactly in proportion to the immateriality of a doctrine, he had always found, was its mysteriousness; and the obstinacy and ingenuity of them that professed it. Therefore did Harold, in the first yearning of his heart for higher attainments, learn to abhor and reject whatever was inscrutable and mysterious as either unnecessary or pernicious, in morals and religion, just as in the commonest affairs of life. The commandments were plain—so were some other principles and laws. Do as thou wouldst be done by!—that was his favourite. It was his religion in so many words; a religion too, from which, if he departed under some fierce and unexpected excitement, his heart never let him rest, until he had returned to it again. `What a sky!' echoed Harold—long, and long after his companion had forgotten his own voice. `A studded canopy of blue crystal, dropt with fire.' Harold was not trying how well he could express the thought of his nature at such a moment, but rather he spoke as if the thought would have way, as if it had fashioned itself in the solitudes of his heart, associated itself with a resemblance, like a chosen and natural companion, and then burst, spontaneously, into being. `I do not know,' said his companion, `that I ever before saw such a sky in this country. I have, in Italy —or perhaps, and I dare say there is much reason in it; perhaps, I am at this moment, one of the happiest that I ever spent, particularly disposed to turn mine eyes and thoughts upward; to ramble about infinity, and to doat and dwell on every green thing, and every living thing, that is within the embrace of my thought, or reach of my vision. Ah, we are happy, here, say what we will, my dear child; and happiness so far over-balances all our sorrows, that it is a sin to complain, under any affliction.' `I do believe it!' responded Harold, devoutly. There was an energy in his manner, too convincing to be doubted. `Yes, my son, it is so; and the sooner you begin to yield yourself entirely to that belief, the sooner you will be what you desire, a good, and therefore a great man; for you will be nearer the best and greatest of beings; more in his presence, and in more intimate communion with his angels. Beside all this, you will have an unfailing support in all tribulation.' `I have found it so. I can now look back upon all my disappointments, and trace them step by step, to their consequences and causes, said Harold, `until I can see them end in something beneficial. Yes, I do believe, that I am, at this moment, the better and happier, for what I once thought would break my heart, or had broken it—events, which I did not wish to survive,' said Harold. `Yours is an enviable disposition,' answered Mr. Hammond; `encourage it. Whatever happen, look for consolation. Do not, as many do, seek to aggravate it. Think how it might have been worse—think of what you have left. Remember those who suffer more, and have less to comfort and uphold them, than yourself. If you lose a friend, and he be wicked, comfort yourself, that he has escaped an additional weight of guilt, if good; that he has not lived to fall.' `My own experience, sir, short as it is,' answered Harold, `has taught me this; to look with distrust upon all events. Hitherto, what I have deemed, at the moment of enjoyment, or in the avidity of anticipation, as the especial and long-sought happiness of my life, has never ultimately proved so; and what I have too often received as a calamity, has generally proved the reverse.' `Perhaps, my young friend, there is a reason for this in our own constitution. If suffering come upon us, we become wiser, more cautious, kinder, avoiding temptation and offence. But if good fortune visit us, we are apt to fall into forgetfulness, insensibility, negligence, excess, and arrogance. Take a familiar example. A man is led into some expense, that upon cool reflection, he finds his circumstances would not justify. As an honest man, he not only determines to avoid a repetition of it, but fixes immediately upon some plan of retrenchment, which probably leaves him a richer one at the end of the year, than he would have been, had he not first been extravagant, or unfortunate. On the contrary, it has become a proverb, that they who get money in lotteries, lose it in lotteries—so too, by any other means, without labour, as by inheritance or marriage. A sudden accession of wealth, is, in nine cases out of ten, the destruction of the soberest man. And I will venture to declare, that within my experience, there is no man who has not died poorer for all the prizes that he has drawn in any of these lotteries. Who are the rich men? They who were born poor—the aged?—they who were once at the point of death, and learnt caution— the good? they that have been wicked.' `They, who have robust constitutions, are less likely to live to a good old age, than others who are sickly. The former are rash, and perpetually plunging into danger; the latter are cautious, on all occasions. Take another example. A boat upsets. Who are the drowned? they that could swim—for they abandoned the boat, while they that could not, clung to it, and were generally saved; and usually, if you hear of one being drowned, it is some one that could swim, and was headstrong, and daring. So with morals—Reputation, and confidence in ourselves, are often our destruction; while distrust ever preserves us, from every trial and temptation.' `A lottery, sir—I have heard you mention the word before—pray, what is it?' `Are you really so ignorant? I am glad of it. It is a legislative gambling.' `Gambling! I do not understand—is not gambling a vice?' `Yes, when perpetrated on a small scale. It is prohibited in private, and among them who have few amusements. Laws are made against it. It is reprobated. The pulpit and the stage, and the forum ring with denunciations against it. A professed gambler is little better than an outcast, living by his plunder and depredations. But, mark the difference. The very government that prohibits small gambling, as ruinous and improvident, in every shape, and leading to the worst encouragement of man's worst vices—his avarice, cunning, and laziness, will set on foot, countenance, and uphold, on the most magnificent scale— a gambling table for millions!' `How!—for what purpose?' `Why, to build a church! a bridge, or a monument.' `A monument! what is that? I am exceedingly ignorant, I confess.' `Some useless edifice; a column for example, of stone masonry, erected at an expense that would build an hospital for the scarred, and wind-beaten veteran— to perpetuate what?—the virtues of men that cannot be forgotten.' `A great man. Is it necessary? Are great men so soon forgotten, here? Are monuments common?' `I am amazed at thy simplicity, Harold. Thou art indeed, a child of nature, a republican after God's own heart. It is, to speak seriously, an idle and profligate waste of money; a shameful and useless piece of ostentation; as if the truly great, and their memories, would not outlast all monuments. And yet, thousands of poor creatures are made to contribute, by ministering to their vices, to the erection of some Babel—and deluded into the most destructive habits, under the fascination of the game. No—if we must have monuments, let them be useful asylums for the indigent. Was the great man a hero, the deliverer of his country, there should be a refuge for them that toiled with him in that delivery, or for the afflicted of their posterity. Beside, it is a wicked and foolish precedent. Every publick man must have his monument, in time.' Harold stood leaning over the gate, under a huge oak, and listening, with all his soul, to the calm, honest speculations of his companion, respecting lotteries, and gambling, and monuments. `Gracious heaven!' cried Harold, at length; `but what respect can men have for such laws? The same deed punished as a crime, denounced and scorned, when done in one way; and yet encouraged, proclaimed, and trumpeted forth, as pious, charitable, and patriotick, if done in another!' `Nay, this is not half,' quoth the other. `A debtor is not deterred from adventuring desperately in a lottery; on the contrary, just in proportion to his emergencies will be his spirit of adventure. He will invest his funds, as a sure resource, in lottery tickets, reasoning thus: `What I win is mine; what I lose is my creditors'. And this is strictly true. In the former case, he goes on, and flourishes away, till new distresses drive him to a repetition of the same adventure; in the latter, he becomes a bankrupt. It is no reproach to have grown rich by a prize; hence, he is not to be deterred from the lottery office, though he be from the gaming table. Of whom, does the winner in a lottery, take his winnings? generally, from the poor and needy; them that are not his equals, and cannot afford to lose. Nay, from men who have starved their families to raise the money, which he has won. How many of the poor and miserable, infatuated by the success of some unknown speculator, by worrying penny from penny out of famine and nakedness; have finally accumulated enough to buy a chance in some lottery—bought it—and spent the period of expectation in a fever of restlessness and idleness, expecting `a prize!' for it is in vain to deny it—every man expects a prize, or he is a fool for buying a share.' `Is not all this worse than gambling? In gambling, you win from your equals. In a lottery, from the very blind, and maimed, and starving of society; at least, in part. Gambling is, therefore, less base and sordid of the two. And is it not, as if heaven so judged it, and dealt out the maledictions of the poor and disappointed? Look about, and see what has become of the fortunate. The reason is plain. There is no miracle, no judgment, no especial interposition of heaven. He who has drawn a prize, becomes a gambler in every thing. Sober acquisition is drudgery to him. No maxim is more universally just than this; whatever is with difficulty acquired, is with difficulty lost. Who are the rich and great?—they that were poor and little. Let no man gamble, if he would be permanently respectable, and least of all, in lotteries. Another reason why they are worse than faro tables, is, that there is no publick obloquy attached to him who has enriched himself by the former, and consequently, nothing to counteract the temptations that beset him, But—' `But, what a sky!' he repeated again, laying his hand affectionately upon Harold's uncovered head. The moon was at the full. The abundant foliage, the changeable willow braid, the distant elevations, were all shifting from alternate shadow of the deepest hue, to the lustre of a mild and beautiful light. Not a sound fell upon the ear. The water below, lay like a sheet of pearl, gently tremulous, and glimmering, as if to the tread of something spiritual, or to some subterranean agitation; while an occasional bubble, breaking in the deeper part, or a sharp, quick ripple, as some insect was suddenly snatched by a glittering creature, that just twinkled along the surface, disturbing the shadow and smoothness, like a flash of fire, under the willow trees, now and then arrested the eye. `Do you see that star?' said the venerable man? `How very bright!' `I have seen that very star in daylight,' said Harold —it is an old acquaintance of mine; at least, so it appears, even in this hemisphere.' `In day light! where?' `In my own country. At four o'clock in the afternoon, I have seen the whole sky of this same deep purple, nay, deeper, almost black, and with all the evenness of a midnight sky—the sun burning with a golden splendour, and a star or two, within its very halo, distinctly visible.' `Can it be!—how do you account for it?' `We attribute it there, to the elevation of the land, but I am inclined to ascribe it to the singular clearness of the atmosphere. Some of its phenomena are very striking. For leagues and leagues, nay, from horizon to horizon, you can see the most delicate smoke. At first sight, judging from the experience of a more northern climate, I have been led to estimate distances as at home: and have believed, that a few hours' travelling would bring us to a smoke, toward which we have actually travelled for whole days afterward, without appearing to approach it. You would hardly credit it, VOL. II. 10 but such is the fact, that a wild buffaloe, or any other animal, which we have butchered and left bleeding, would dry up without any symptom of putrescency— giving out no offensive odour, and literally exhaling their juices, as by a chemical operation.' `It is very warm then, I suppose.' `No; not more so, than in more northern climates; or at least, not so, as to be sensible to us.' `What a beautiful firmament it must be.' `Yes; but, like all others, it has its drawback. It is blinding, in its effect upon the eyes. Many of the natives are blind; and, of our party, when I visited it, many became totally so.' `Another instance of that equality of distribution in the gifts, and blessings of heaven, which we have been speaking of. But you mentioned other phenomena.' `Yes; and I will enumerate some. Our liquors would dry so fast, that some of our party could scarcely be persuaded, that others had not robbed them. I remember once, when the colour of the sky was particularly striking, for its exceeding clearness and depth of blue, that three of us left our encampment, for the purpose of visiting a huge mass of rocks, that appeared, at the furthest, only a few hours travel from us, and actually lowering above our heads. We could distinguish the festoons of wild, creeping plants upon them: and the divisions, strata, and coloured veins, were distinctly to be traced; but we travelled a whole day and night, and then gave up the attempt, unable even to conjecture the distance. It happened, however, soon after, that we visited part of this same mountain. It was one of a vast chain. Our company were about eighty hunters, with their horses, buffaloes, tents, and game. A part of us ascended the mountain, when we found that the trailing vines, as we had supposed them to be, were trees of gigantick dimensions; and that what we mistook for veins, were, in reality, immense cavities, fissures, and chasms. That we might the more easily return to the spot, whence we departed, we took for our guide, a glittering white rock, resembling, in its altitude and dimensions, a fortress, which stood just above the heads of our party. We soon lost sight of it, however, and on our return, were first struck, while looking for it, with what appeared to be a bright star. We approached; it grew larger, but not brighter, until we found it to be the whole rock. In other climates, you know, an object like this, waxes dimmer and dimmer as we leave it. This did not—it only grew smaller and smaller, and was as bright when we first saw it, as when we were near—Ah!—do you hear nothing?—' `Yes, something from the water, like mournful musick.' Harold trembled—`It is very mournful,' said he—`gracious heaven! I have heard that before—that, in the very wilderness of America—O, I remember it well—my father used to sing it to me, in my childhood. I have never heard it since—my mother too!—perhaps it is her voice—hush!—hush!—Dost thou believe, good old man, that the disembodied are ever permitted to revisit the earth for any purpose?' `Art thou serious?' said his companion, in an agitated voice. `Yea, to the furthest and holiest solemnity of my thought.' `Well then, I will utter that to thee, which I never uttered to any human being before—I do believe it!—I have seen and heard the departed.' Harold quaked as if he were communing with some spiritual one, and saw all the mystery and terrour of the charnel house, laid slowly open before his eyes. The musick seemed to approach. A clear and tender voice accompanied it. `It is of earth!' said Harold, `but I could almost believe that my own dear mother, to whom I am sure, my father, when he was happy, taught that song, was visiting me. O, there are no associations of memory so tender, so soothing, so beautifully touching, as those of musick. You feel as if her harp, hung up in the desolate apartments of your heart, were taken tenderly down, by some loved and departed spirit, and touched kindly again, with all the inimitable delicacy of another world, and all the truth of life.' It was a harp! and Harold heard it for the first time. There was nothing artificial, nothing difficult, even to his ear, in the serene and thrilling modulations. It died away, and he stood like one entranced, waiting on tip toe, to catch the first sound of something heavenly in its approach. A momentary intermission, and then followed a recitative so expressive, so sweet, and so passionate withal, that he clasped his hands involuntarily, and the tears stood in his eyes—the voice rang in his very heart, like the note of a silver bugle, blown at midnight, over the dim water. `Let us go in, Harold—the night dews are heavy,' said the old man, taking his arm. `Caroline's voice hath more witchery, there.' `Caroline! was it she, then, that passed by me in the wind!—dear Caroline!' They entered, and Caroline timidly gave her hand to Harold, who, scarcely daring to believe that a form so frail, a countenance so delicate and meek, could have poured out such a profusion of sound, with such compass, and power, and yet with such exquisite and feeling modulation, threw his arm around her beautiful waist, and said in a low, agitated voice, `was it thy voice, Caroline?' She smiled, and put back the dark hair that fell over his forehead, as he leaned toward her, with his whole soul breaking out of his eyes. `Yes, brother, it was. Did it reach your ear?' `Yes, and my heart—it is there yet. I hear it, feel it, in all those sweet, impassioned, enthusiastick undulations, revelling in its caverns!— Come, dear, let me hear it once more.' She shook her head. `Nay, Caroline, only once more.' It was in vain to refuse—she was too gentle for that; so, putting away his fond arm, and adjusting her beautiful hair, which had fallen over her eyes, she began another song. Her voice trembled at first, a very little, but soon became steady; while her bosom heaved, and her tremulous lip betrayed the deep emotion of her heart. She felt every word, and every note. It was a simple and melancholy song, and the expression of her eyes was so mournful and touching, the smooth, flutelike tune of her throat so tender and clear, that all who heard her, held their breath without knowing it. Harold's `rapt soul was sitting in his eyes;' he dwelt upon hers, and their intensely deep expression of tenderness: their hue had changed, they were almost black, and when her long sweet toning, which appeared so natural, and so endless, as if her breath would never fail her, growing louder and clearer, without effort or suspension;—with her forehead elevated, her eyes uplifted, and her lashes glistening—when all this awoke before him, Harold could have thrown himself upon her bosom, sobbing with delight, and called her his own, his only sister. She arose, and when she met her brother's eye, wet and gleaming like a dark brilliant, she blushed. It was now time to separate—Harold pressed her pure forehead, and turned to depart. `O, no, Harold—no!'—said Caroline. `That must not be. We have arranged all this. Our guardian here, says that this is your home.' `Home!' cried Harold, inaudibly—the sound was so delightful to him—to be at home, at last, when he had looked for it only in the green earth. His heart breathed, as it were, in tears that had flowed from the soft eyes of beauty. Here was his sister—a creature sprung up, all at once before him, as if by enchantment; a flower found in a desolate place, by running water— Their friends had gone, gone in silence, and Caroline and Harold sat, holding each other's hands, and watching their carriage, as it rolled away through the dim avenue, the harness here and there glittering, for a brief moment, in the moonlight, and the wheels alternately rattling over the stone bridge, or cutting with a dull, heavy sound, their path through the fine wet sand. Caroline was leaning, with a mingled sensation of love and shame, delight and modesty, upon his shoulder,— her sweet face lifted to heaven, with the dewy traces of recent weeping yet to be seen, about her smooth eyes. `Sleepy? my sister'—It was delightful to pronounce the endearing name. `Caroline, love—art thou sleepy?' said Harold, softly pressing her to his bosom. `O, no! or if I were,' said she, meekly, `I could 10* sleep here forever!' turning her face downward, and dropping her lids with the affectionate delicacy of a young and innocent creature, who, unaccustomed to the caresses of a man, is trembling even within the arms of a brother. Their cheeks touched; her hair blew over his face— his fingers strayed a moment among the soft tresses, and he drew her eye-lids again, and again to his lips, with a feeling of the purest tenderness. Her colour came, and the poor girl half broke from his arms, before she recollected that he was her brother; but when she did, she replaced herself in the same situation, with a charming expression of confidence, consummate confidence. `How like you are to Oscar!' said Caroline, after gazing at him, with uncommon steadiness, for a moment. `You have all but his fierceness—his implacable dominion of eye and forehead—and your mouth, it is a kinder mouth; and then, you are so much younger— how old are you, brother?' `Twenty-two, dear.' `And I only eighteen—why, really, I think that I am about as old as you.' Harold was thoughtful—`why, how is this?' said he, `do you recollect our father?' `No, I never saw him,' answered Caroline, trembling. `The last time my mother met him, it was unexpectedly. He had been in the east, as she then supposed—and he departed immediately after I was born. We have never heard of him, or from him, since.' Harold knew not that his father had ever returned, even for an hour, from America; but now he recollected that there was a story among his enemies that he had died, and was buried; and that two or three autumns afterward he reappeared; and was found, sitting upon his own grave, by some hunters, who had wandered and tracked him in the frost and leaves. `Did'st thou love Oscar? Caroline.' `Love him! O, that I did. Harold, dear, dear Harold—(she kissed him with a convulsive lip) beware of his example. O, he was too like thee, I fear—and thou art too like him, I am told.' `But go—go, now, my beloved brother,' she added, smiling. `You will want refreshment; and to tell you the truth, I do think that a few hours repose will not be amiss for me; and yet I cannot sleep—I am too happy to sleep; and last night, I was too anxious. I have'nt set down, since day light, expecting my brother, and have not eaten a mouthful—I could not eat, could you? my heart was too full. I was too happy to eat too, I believe. So, good night, Harold!' Saying this, she arose, and, Harold reluctantly prepared to obey, as she touched the bell; but she arrested him, adding with a serious countenance, `stay, dear brother—there are some old habits, notions, repugnances to be overcome in this family—and the sooner we begin to overcome them, the better. Will you sleep in Oscar's room?' `In Oscar's! my brother's? Certainly, with all my heart.' `Thank you, thank you, Harold! That is another trait of resemblance, so prompt and decisive!' A silence of some minutes followed. `It has never been opened since the evening—nay, I cannot tell thee when'—(her face grew palid) `until within a few days, except by the servants to dust and air it. Every thing within it, every thing, I believe, is exactly as he left it. You will sleep in the same bed— read the same books—by the same lamp—and,' she added, cheerfully patting his arm, `by and by, we will sit and sing together, as he and I used to—poor Oscar! do you sing, Harold?' `No, dear!' `No!—not sing! why, what do you do with that voice of yours. It is one of the finest in the world; Elvira says it is—nay, dont blush, I'm sure 'tis the truth. So, I shall teach you to sing. Do you play?' `Yes, the broadsword.' `Ah, brother!' cried the poor girl, `every word that you utter, reminds me so of Oscar, that I quake in imagining some fearful resemblance. That was exactly his manner once, when I heard him—it nearly cost him his life. We were at a table, together. He was only a boy. A gentleman present, who was certainly not very scrupulous in his matters of fact, complained, when pressed to eat of a certain dish, that he could not.' `Why, said my aunt?' `I have a blister on my tongue, madam.' `Perhaps you have been telling a fib,' said a little pert cousin of mine.' `No,' said Oscar, rivetting his fierce eyes upon the man's face, and speaking in a deliberate, low voice, that made every heart thrill—no! I suspect that the gentleman has been telling the truth. O, Harold! never shall I forget the tone in which that was said, the burning sarcasm of look—nor the scene that followed. The man was carried home, as we thought, mortally wounded, for he had the audacity to strike Oscar.' `Strike him!' cried Harold, raising his arm, `and what did Oscar then?' `Smote him to the heart!' said Caroline, trembling all over, `as I fear you would do!—O, Harold!—Harold—I could not bear to lose thee!—I loved him with all his faults, and he was very stern and awful to me at times. But I loved him, when all else had ceased to love him; and I will love thee, my brother, wert thou more terrible than was ever Oscar—redder—aye, redder with the blood of mine own heart—of him I so loved!—Ah, mercy! mercy!' Harold caught her in his arms—bore her to the window, where she soon recovered. She then rang the bell, and, with her own hand, lighted him to his apartment. Her tread faltered as she entered—and she leant more heavily upon his arm, and trembled, as he thought. A superb harp, much larger and more costly than that below, rested in a niche, with a coloured, arching window near, reaching from the top to the bottom of the wall. A table, with musick open, lay before it; a candle partly burnt down; a flute; a dirk; from which Mary turned her eyes with a quick shudder, as Harold laid his hands upon it. A flood of moonlight, pouring through the white curtains, fell upon the floor, and upon a picture opposite. Harold paused. A single glance was sufficient. It was Oscar himself; Oscar in his strength and sublimity; his dark eye searching your heart; his lips, partly unclosed, as about to speak what his proud nature scorned to conceal; and his bold front; thick locks; grandeur of forehead, together with the spirited, firm and accurate cut of outline, formed altogether an assemblage of character, never to be forgotten. The expression was collected, thoughtful, wrought with fire, just as he had seen it in life. Harold could not forbear looking up to it, and dwelling upon the deep composure of its countenance, the far thought that seemed impatiently working itself upward from the depth of a mighty heart, and the yearning eagerness of look, as of one intent upon wonderful things. `How like his attitude and bearing in life,' exclaimed Harold, locking his hands, `so stern, so high, so cold! rebuking all around him into silence and awe.' `Once more Caroline, dear Caroline, good night.' `Good night! good night! Harold.' Harold threw himself upon a couch; but it was in vain to think of sleeping. He arose, and set his lamp in the niche, and his thoughts took a course, in which they had long been familiar, over the wide Atlantic, to his Indian girl. `O, Loena!' he said aloud, `would that thou wast near me! that thou couldst write to me, or I to thee!' He arose and walked the room, waxing feverish, as he reflected on the time that must elapse, in a season of war, before he could know aught of her destiny. `I will write this moment to De Vaudreuil,' said he, and seated himself at the table. He attempted to open the drawer, and at length succeeded, but the bolts of the lock were rusty from long disuse. He found what he wanted, some paper, but it was spotted and discoloured, and soaked, as if some glutinous liquid had penetrated the wood and stained it, long, and long before. He found some words, faintly traced, as by a female hand upon the top of one of the pages. It was as follows: `En esto quisiera ser instruida con toda exactitud. — — Amais todavia a vuestra.—E.' This was sufficient for Harold; he shrank from a further examination of the words, satisfied that they were the language of love. He next observed the green cloth that covered the desk; that too, was stiff and dark, as if saturated with —he shuddered—his brain grew dark—perhaps this was the very room where the murder was perpetrated —it was—it must be so—and that was the very dagger!—`yet why are they here?' said he. `Blood! blood!' cried Harold, convulsively retreating from it, fearing even to set his foot upon the floor, as if it were yet slippery,—to lay his hand upon a chair, lest he might find it adhesive, when he would pluck it away. He turned to the window, giddy and sick; the cool air was delicious. It came, like a blessing, to his forehead and lips; but, as he threw aside the heavy white curtains, to obtain a freer view of the prospect, he observed a deep shadow upon them, a shadow which remained after he had separated the folds; he laid his hand upon it, it was harsh and unpleasant to the touch; he revolted, as his hand came in contact with it, and then, like one maddening in delirium, impatient to know the worst at once, he ran to the bed and threw down the sheets, expecting to find a body bleeding and wounded in his very bed—he was beside himself, indeed, with fear; but he was disappointed. The bed was untenanted, and the linen, white as the driven snow, unstained, unpolluted. `But why are they left thus?' he cried, `is it to appal me? What fearful crime is this, whose vestiges beset me? And why am I made to sleep in the very presence of the murderer, and the murdered? Is it, that they whom I have slain, may start up in their winding sheets? He leant his forehead upon his hands, his temples throbbing with dreadful violence, and his arteries aching with the heavy current of his blood. He arose to take down a book, determined to read, when he recollected the bundle of letters which Elvira had given him. They were in his baggage, and he soon tore them open, and began reading; he trembled; a fierce and apalling intensity increasing, as he proceeded —The manuscripts were numbered, and he was proceeding to assort them, when the apparition of Oscar suddenly stood before him!—the paper fell from his hands —he gasped for breath—what had disturbed the dreadful spirit? Was he tresspassing upon his exclusive dominion? He had come too, unannounced, unheralded, and there he was! Harold attempted to speak, but he could utter no sound. A cloud passed over the shadow, and it was gone. Could he have been deceived? Was it not the very form and attitude of his dead brother? The light again shone out, and the spectre reappeared in the same place—he approached it with a leap, and as he thought, passed through it! His blood curdled, and his knees smote together at first; nor was it until he had uncovered his eyes, and changed his position, that he discovered the truth—it was his own shadow upon the wall! The hot blood rushed over his cheeks, as he made the discovery—`accursed effects of education,' he cried, `how terribly have I been unmanned, again and again, with some such delusion as this; and yet I have no more command of myself now, than I had in my childhood, when I used to hear of spectres, and devils.' He reseated himself, still trembling, and began to read. Alas, Alas! it is no wonder that he shook. It was his own destiny. The hand writing was new to him. It was a bold, strong, uniform character; and Harold, who had long observed that all our habits are but an epitome of our character, felt instantly convinced that the writer was alike, intellectually bold, and uniform. He whose character is established, he had observed, does every thing methodically, and alike—he walks, and writes, and talks, neither faster nor slower; while he, who is variable and capricious, writes a variety of hands, never walks twice alike, and is eternally going faster or slower in his speech. He opened number 1. It was a letter of advice, and opinion, and related, Harold soon found reason for believing, to Oscar. It described some young man, as compounded of the most contradictory and heroick qualities;—suspicious, yet full of unexampled confidence at times; generous, and magnanimous, yet revengeful to an excess; unsparing and deadly in his hostilities, yet risking his life and soul for the benefit of his mortal enemy; courting danger and difficulty; delighting in contradiction and paradox in all sciences, and on all subjects; eloquent, passionate, persevering; superstitious to the last degree, and subject to such tremendous transports of rage, that they had finally destroyed him. Allusions were darkly made to some mysterious crime—but as if it were perpetrated in delirium. He took up another. It was in a female hand, written evidently with a perturbed spirit, and probably copied, as it appeared to be a narrative, interrupted and broken, though joined altogether by the last copier. It was as follows: `How still it is! The very winds are lifeless. A moment since, and they came over my hot forehead, from the north, like the breathing of a strong man. The beating of my temples hath ceased. My arteries too, are tranquil, now, but very cold and icy. Why is this? O Nature! Is it sympathy between ye and me, ye winds! clouds! and thou, sky of the Almighty! dwelling of the unapproachable—thou! the self-upholden vault!— `O Nature! my passions awake and are rebellious with thee; and thou, O moon! who holdest thy continuity of march, forever and ever, whence is thy dominion over me! With thee, I wax and wane! With thee I conjure up the elements—holding communion with spiritualities, broad and boundless. With thine, my light is diminished and shut out, and I am doomed to accompany thee, in thine eternal pilgrimage of shadow and change. My passions slumber or storm with thee! When thou art upon the great deep, lo! my spirit is with thee! `— O, why is this! But a little while, and I was lifted above mortality; for thy winds went by me, and over me, thou blue heaven! and encompassed me round about. A cheerful tide, a very wonderful tide, flowed over my poor withered, desolate heart. It was refreshed, and filled up, and I was happy. It was upborne, and whirling, and eddying therein.' `How still it is! Behold yon beautiful assembly of trees, the waving tresses of yon high battlements, swinging, all flower and greenness, in the star-light. The sky, the illimitable, the inaccessible sky! with all the drifting clouds, hurrying away beneath it, like a routed multitude, with banners and smoke; rallying anon, and parting again, and disappearing—with here and there, a luminous ridge, as of drifted pearl, washed up on the sea shore—and there, a vast tent, shattered in the wind, and covering the blue void with luminous and flying fragments. And the blue, dim water yonder, all now rolling, and heaving, and murmuring with inward vitality—even that is hushed now, into an awful repose. The moonlight too, but now trembling with activity, like a vapour of quicksilver, hath grown brighter, unspeakably brighther, but motionless. O, this is no natural shining—it is the breath of a spirit! Can it be her's?—no, no—it is the cold, still lustre of a northern sky, in the depth of winter—not a tender, warm, autumnal light, befitting the season—no!— `My thoughts too—where are they? hitherto rioting and soaring, full of wing and motion—aspiring, gallantly, to an equality with the highest and brightest of yonder high and bright divinities of fire. Stars!—I kneel to you. Ye, that are established round about the dwelling of my Father, ye cherubim—ye that tread, forever and ever, the fathomless vacancy of heaven. Ye seraphim!—O scorn me not—for lo, I am as one of you. The divinity is stirring within me, and behold, I mount! I mount! — — — — O, my beloved! where art thou? The winds have died away, and I hear not yet thy foot-step in the air. O moon!—a death-like expression is sitting even in thy countenance. Thou art unusually pale. And thou, dearest—thou, whom I can see, with thy fair tresses, floating like a halo, about thee, thou art dim, and distant to my weary and disconsolate heart. O shine out! shine out! — — — — where am I?—what am I?—subdued—sickening—fainting— clinging to the vile earth for support, and sustenance— yea, to the very rocks, from whose crown I have just VOL. II. 11 leaped, in exulting derision—trampled on and spurned. How still it is!—' Such was the language of this paper. Another followed, marked 3, appearing to have been written by another person. It was almost illegible, and after this fashion. `He stood, with his cheek resting upon his hand, and leaning against a high rock, from which, I verily believe, that he had just leaped. How he escaped, is unaccountable to me; for I have known animals to be dashed in pieces, by falling from it. His forehead was gathered and wrought, and somewhat agitated at times; for, now and then, there was a hasty quivering over its mortal paleness, as if it was the surface of some liquid, inwardly disturbed. Within his sunken, wild, and singularly beautiful eyes, there was a sad and settled expression, as of one, originally filled with high thought, and clothed with prerogative—who had been stricken from his sphere. As his forehead darkened, his black eye would shine out, for a moment, and then wane away, as if it were holding a brief communion, by glimpses, with some spiritual thing, invisible to the rest of the world, and passing very near to it. His thick, shining hair, neglected, and black as jet, gathered, with the effect of sculpture about his low, pale forehead, and, as he stood before me, shadowing the upper part of his remarkable face, gave such bold, and effectual relief to his spirited features, and such additional brightness to the thin emaciated hands, which, in the abstraction of his spirit, as his eyes were devoutly raised, were buried in the thick locks, as to give to his whole person, so motionless and picturesque, all the effect of beautiful sculpture by moonlight. Thus stood he; and thus looked he, when I first encountered him, on that memorable evening. Judge of my emotion, my terrour. I knew his character, his mortal hatred for me; and I had fallen upon him thus, unexpectedly, unarmed, and upon the brow of a precipice. My knees knocked together, and I lost my breath entirely. And yet, there was such a fascination about him that I could not leave him, nay, I did not even wish to leave him. He was very beautiful, thrillingly so. In his immovable attitude, in the unostentatious, careless grace, and waving outline of his person—in the singular firmness and precision of his features—the shadows so bold— and the lights so lucid, and yet, of such death-like, marble whiteness, there was a combination too unearthly to be forgotten. And I—I would as soon have looked from the lake of Geneva, up to some inaccessible height, and expected the genius of statuary herself, to burst, from the solid rock, upon my vision, as to have seen him, in such a scene, at such a moment. Such was my infatuation, too, that, I verily believe, that had I seen the red clouds rolling under his feet, and the blue lightnings discharged from his hands, it would not have augmented my astonishment. He stood so like a being of another world, half embodied in the moonlight.' `All around were huge, mis-shapen rocks, bleak mountains, and precipices; riven, and splintered peaks —hung with funereal verdure, and garlanded with blasted underwood—reflected in a deep, fathomless, cold water. The sky was of a remarkable colour—very clear, and glittering with a metallick splendour, and a tinge of crimson, that kept shifting incessantly over it, like the red light of battle on the steely armour of charging cavalry:—a vault, built of blue satin spar, illuminated by coloured vapours, and broken diamonds. `His form, I had leisure now to study. He took no notice of me. I wondered at it, for he evidently saw me, but as if he saw me not. It was attenuated grievously, by his wandering and confinement. He looked like one who can see his own heart decaying, dropping away, piecemeal, before his own eyes. His voice was musick itself, but a musick so melancholy, of a sweetness so broken-hearted, so like the voice of one that is going alive, trembling, and reluctant to his own coffin— going!—in the full possession of every sublime and towering faculty—knowing his destiny—knowing that he must die—that there is no health in him—no help for him—going—into the chamber of death! Gracious heaven! what a situation for one like him—lingering and decaying; exhausting his spirit in prayer, knowing for what he was created, and what he might have been, with a few more years, a little patience, a little love, a little charity and forbearance, a kind heart to beat with his, to be his heaven and refuge; in the ranks and on the roll of glory, mingling in the shock of armies, thundering in the senate chamber, battling for liberty and renown, side by side, with the youthful and the great, the covetous of dominion; or standing in the commission of the MOST HIGH, and stretching out his hands, like the apostle, above the altars and the gods of idolatry, which shook, and fell, and crumbled, and disappeared before his denunciation; or tuning a loud and lofty harp, under the visiting of inspiration, in wind and fire. O think of him! weep for him! pray for him, as I did, knowing that the hand of death was upon him, and that he was waning away, like an ethereal presence before some unholy rite. And such a voice! O I shall never hear it again. Oscar, mine enemy! I could have loved thee! I would, had not thy terrible hand cut asunder the ties that were attaching my spirit to thine. Methinks I can hear thy voice now, whenever the moon is at the full, and I am wandering where I last saw thee! so bewildering, melancholy, sweet, and uncertain, like the lingering intonations of a broken heart.' — The narrative was here taken up with allusions that were utterly unintelligible, for a whole page; but these were succeeded by another hand-writing—as follows: `His sister was sitting by his side; her eyes were meekly lifted, and rivetted upon his with the most affectionate solicitude. A stranger might have suspected an interest more tender, treacherous, thrilling, intertwining, with a more delicate avidity, with the keenest tendrils of sensibility—somewhat, more impassioned than sisters ever feel for brothers, in the beautiful and devout earnestness of her watching. It was a sister studying the deep, deep spirit of her brother, in its most awful and mysterious abstraction—contemplating him as a creature of other elements, more sublimated, more spiritualized, than herself; or, indeed, than any other being on earth, compounded of dust and ashes. She was right. He was, although chiefly of baser materials, so mixed up with fire and gold, and glittering and precious essences, as to be unlike aught of earthly creation, except its idols. He was a genius; but O, how unlike them that are so called. He did not affect to be gloomy, wretched, or stern; no! but with all things to make him so, he was forever the reverse. He was a creature of the rarest intellectual combination —made up of properties, active and illimitable; sensibilities, of a touch and tenderness so exquisite, as to madden in their excitement; an imagination without limit or shape, beating with vast and articulate conceptions; a heart swelling, when smitten or oppressed, like a trampled empire, with august and terrible apparitions; with thoughts rising from the dust, and standing up, in the plenitude of authority, like monarchs that have been buried together, with all the trappings of royalty; and rising at the trumpet of the last day. In one word, Oscar was a genius. The fountains of his inspiration ran fire, and were to be approached, when in blast, but at the peril of blindness and destruction. The promptings of his god were for the hallowed and secret recesses of his heart; a fearful solitude, full of strange shapes, and echoing only to the thunder; and illuminated only by the pale lightning. Yes! Oscar was a genius; from head to foot, a creature of desperate energies, irregular appetite, and sublime incoherency—feeling his unquestioned, unquestionable prerogative, and trampling, in the pride of his heart, in mockery, upon the prejudices of men; filled with a devouring intensity of thought that burned like a furnace, overflowing with molten gold, running with lava—fervid and blinding! stationed, in unapproachable supremacy, occupying, as by the mere action of his own will, where none might dare to gainsay it, the chiefest elevation among the gifted and endowed, the sons of God! yet torn, distracted, as by a beleaguering host without, and a rebellious spirit within, forever battling there with unappeasable ambition. `He had already, young as he was, sallied out upon the highway of nations; tendered his contribution to 11* the crowned and sceptred things of earth, toiled and battled, and conquered. He had been shipwrecked, shattered, and thrown, with all the accumulated riches of his life, his honour, love, hope, ambition, upon an iron shore. The temple, toward which he had trodden in pilgrimage, with bleeding and naked feet, incessantly receding as he approached, had, at last—when he thought to set his foot, with the very next step, upon its glittering, burnished threshold, and lay hold upon the horns of the altar, smoking with incense, and resounding with musick, and hung with garlands of fire and beauty—vanished—vanished forever! What then? He awoke from his long and burning trance. He lifted his arms to heaven. He invoked the presence of his beloved. He was in a desert—but she obeyed—for she loved him. A fountain arose at their feet—he stooped with his parched lips—and it disappeared forever, in the dry sand! The waters of his heart turned to bitterness. The fountain of tears and tenderness stagnated on the spot, and a vapour of repulsion and death arose from its effervescence—yea, death! Those hands—those very hands—so innocent, pale, and youthful, and emaciated, they have been reeking in blood. Yea—and the blood would be upon them yet, had they not been washed in the rain of heaven. Once they were red, hot, and smoking; and he flourished them, in the delirium of his soul, to the sky—in the loud wind—and over the roaring flood, swearing that, by no other than the rain drop, and the dew, the dampness of twilight, and the mountain mist, and the spray of the cataract, would he suffer the pollution to be washed away! And they had done it!—heaven had done it! The rain and the dew had fallen, and the red stains were effaced, once more, from his transparent fingers.' Here was an interruption—some erasures—followed with occasional remarks in a hand like Elvira's. They were as follows: `The very character and turn of thought so peculiarly distinguishing this isolated and strange being, are expressed here, with astonishing fidelity. It has all his brokenness, mystery, abruptness and strength. Indeed, I should believe, were such a thing possible, that Oscar himself had dictated the language, in which he is described, so deeply imbued is it with the fierce and preternatural ardour and spirit, that prevailed in his conversation after he slew —.' A word was here very carefully obliterated, but still Harold was able to discover that it was a name, and if he were not led wildly astray, it was the name of Elvira. But that could not be. She was living. His agitation prevented him, for some minutes, from continuing the inquiry; and when he did, he fell upon the following, in another hand: `A part is here omitted, my dear, it remains in my possession, however, and, when necessary, shall be put into your hands. For myself, I am satisfied that he thinks her dead—and it would be well to suffer the room to remain exactly as it is—precisely—with all its terrible array of furniture and blood—even to the spots and stains, where it spouted upon the window curtains. I gave immediate orders to that effect, under the advice of Doctors S.— and R.— who agree that if we have any thing to hope, it must be from the violent shock that he will receive when, as we have concerted the plan, we shall bring him, blindfolded, to the spot of the murder, and there, at night, in the very room, at the very hour, with all the furniture in the same situation, by the same light, unbandage his eyes, and leave him there, alone! It cannot make him worse, and it may have some good effect. It is desperate, I—.' The rest was illegible; but in rummaging over the papers, he found a remarkably neat manuscript, which he felt, instantly in his heart, was by Caroline herself. The hand-writing was very peculiar, firm, upright, and singularly unaffected. `I shall give it to you precisely as it was written, long, long after the melancholy event took place. I had leisure then to dwell upon it, and touch out the parts, almost as I would an ideal history; for, would you believe it? it appears to me now, more like a transaction that has occurred to somebody else, than to myself; more like something dreamt of, in some frightful malady, than the experience of myself. Much of it is in his very language. I shall never forget it—nay, have I not good reason, dear?—never to forget it.' `Here!—here we are at last, then! Are we not high enough yet, love? We are above the world. Look yonder—the dark spots upon that hill are moving—lo, they are human creatures!—upon the moon too! Who knows but we may appear to them, poor pilgrims! as they do to us. There!—now we are upon the very pinnacle. How strong the wind is! Mind thy foothold, Caroline —and cling to me—if we fall—that we may fall together. What an infinity is above us. And this rock— yea, this is the very rock!—how like an altar it is.' His eyes sparkled strangely, as he said this, and he knelt down and kissed it. `Stay Caroline—there is another altar—a higher—a holier one—built by God's angels, with their own hands—a little higher up. Wilt thou ascend with me? It is a place of sacrifice. If thy heart fail thee, abide thou here!' I answered `Yes! I will go up with thee, go were thou wilt.' `That is an altar,' he said, pointing upward, to a jutting cliff, `I have been there, at night—at midnight, holding counsel with the red stars, clouds, winds! And who came to me, Caroline, who, thinkest thou, came down to me, and scooped her hand into the solid rock, and laved my temples with a water so mortally cold, that—they have been aching ever since!' We approached a broad white stone, leaning like an inclined plane, upon a stratum of crumbling slate or pumice; the moon shone upon it, and the deep sculpture of many a wayward hand, the broken and blunted letters—defaced by the elements—appeared like a rude inscription upon some entrance to the caverns of the earth—the Golgotha of the mountain. I trembled with a superstitious and unknown terrour. He sat down.' `Let us be seated, Caroline. Let us pray. I would pray—canst thou, dear?' A dead silence followed. I was afraid to interrupt him. He lay with his whole length upon the stone, leaning upon his elbow, his eyes fixed upon the distant sky, as if expecting some portent. It was all of a turbid blue; with dim, sunken gold, here and there gleaming doubtfully through the clouds. I moved—for it was damp and chilly, and I was anxious to return. `Awake! awake!' he cried, springing upon his feet, and shouting so, that the mountains around, answered on all sides, `awake! there is a noise in heaven! awake!' `Awake! awake!' said the echo, so distinctly that I, who had heard it often in day light, was startled. `I hear you,' he answered. `Be ye also ready! rebellious spirits. Ye are summoned.' The mountain answered, syllable, by syllable, as with the voice of a trumpet, in the caverns of the earth, `Ye are summoned!' Why did I shudder. I knew it was an echo, only an echo. I had heard it a thousand times, in its most apalling distinctness, and yet I fell upon my knees, involuntarily, now at the sound, and felt as if a was summoned indeed. `Caroline—see'st thou that star—away there?' said he, `nay, not there—higher, higher!—all alone—so beautifully tranquil. Well, (his voice grew deeper and deeper. It was an articulate breathing, and very terrible in its wild, musical solemnity,) well! when last I saw that star, it was upon the wide ocean. It was very cold, and I was alone. I saw it, felt it. Its light fell, like cold rain upon a naked heart. That night I was shipwrecked! It is the star of my nativity. It appears to me again! It is the third time.' (When was the second, brother, said I, in a terrified whisper.) `Girl!—the second was on the 22nd of October.' (I uttered an involuntary cry of horrour.) Thou knowest the reason. That was the night of his guilt. And now I tremble— now, in all my joints, at the thought of it; and still, such was my infatuation, that I never thought of myself, when he so darkly disclosed his purpose.' `Caroline,' said he, resuming, `there are strange, unnatural, incredible experiences in my life, interwoven with the brief, hurried influences of that star. I came here to-night, knowing that it would appear. I came to night, to meet it once more. O, how many tender, dear, weeping recollections come with it! God of benevolence!—By the light of that star—ere it blazed with pestilence and death—and denunciation—ere its colour changed—for once, Caroline, it was the loveliest star in heaven—the most delicate—there was once none of that fiery red in it—By the light of that star, I loved—by it, I was loved again. I wept under it, and was blessed. I was the happiest of human creatures! It turned red—and I was wrecked and bloody, ere the revolution of another moon! O, our father! did I sin in my idolatry? and was the idol to be sacrificed? O, why was I not commanded to offer up the blind and impious idolater? But no—it is impossible. I worshipped her, it is true—but in her, I worshipped thee. I saw only thy purity, in her innocent heart—thy benignity, in her loving eye. By that star, Caroline, He blessed me, and by that He—even He, commanded— beheld, nay assisted in the sacrifice. He was the high priest. The stars were his Urim and Thummim. By that star, have I loved—battled—conquered—been driven over the waters, in foam and blood—and drifted under it—that pale, treacherous, wicked light, a naked and insensible corse, upon the rocky, and desert islands of the sea. I feel thy raying in my very hair—and yet, even yet, my allegiance to thee is unshaken. Still thou hast dominion over me. Thou art very beautiful, star of my idolatry—and very fatal, yet I do not curse thee. And why? Only because, with thy dim and quiet light, thou didst once shine down upon the naked forehead of Elvira, when her cheek rested upon mine. But for that—that, thou accursed light, I would have made war upon thee—war! perpetual war, till thou or I were quenched. It was upon this very altar. There she sat—there, she put down her sweet hand—poor Elvira. Caroline, do not move, I charge thee, do not. A strong hand is over thee. It were death to stir.' `Nay, my brother,' said I, startled at his imperative manner, and now beginning to fear for him, and lamenting my own rashness in accompanying so far at such an hour. `Nay, I cannot, do not mean unkindly. I would not leave thee. I know the awful structure of thy thought. Thou art strong—very strong, on all subjects but one. On that, I dare not trust thee. Thou art vitally wrong. Remember thy endowments; whose steward art thou? the suffering of thy boyhood, Oscar; the peculiar and mysterious incidents, which to me, with my susceptibility to thy influence, were only strange and unaccountable, have been regarded by thee —nay, deny it not, as of a nature not of this world. This has made thee visionary. Bear with me, Oscar. It is weakness—nay, it is worse, ten thousand times worse. It is impiety to believe it. My brother, what means this emotion? Is there something yet untold— even yet? If there be, speak to me, in mercy. Tell me the worst at once. Let not my imagination worry itself again, in darkness, with the wrestling fiends that invade her empire.' Oscar made no reply, but throwing himself upon his feet, and raising his locked hands to his forehead, he cried, in a tone of sudden eagerness and solemnity, that thrilled me to the heart—`Come, come, let us begone! The night air blows too coldly upon thee, my love— Come, come. Nay, Caroline, dear. Thy very hair is wet, thy very garments drenched, in the dew of night. Cold! cold! and art thou not afraid? How long have we been here? Is it possible—three whole hours.' `Even so,' said I, taking his arm; `but they are three such hours, as I could not pass again.' `What! not with me, in loneliness and silence. Girl! they are hours of religious festival, worth a whole life of less awful, less agitating devotion. I would not exchange this temple, this altar—such scenery, and such feelings, so melancholy and wrapt, for all that the world could give!' `My brother,' said I, `let us begone.' `How hollow thy voice sounds, Caroline,' said he, pressing close to me, and speaking in a deep whisper. `Nay, nay—not now I beseech thee!' he cried, in a tone of expostulation, so wild and unearthly that I shall never, never forget it—`not now! not now! I cannot!' This he said, as if to some invisible creature near him. `Not to-night! Oh no! not to-night!' he repeated, in a whisper, turning his face as he spoke, as if something stood at his shoulder —`what! must it be? O, Caroline!' He covered his face with his hands—fell upon his knees, caught mine to his lips, and wept upon them, and sobbed out my name, in a paroxysm of tenderness. I wondered at his emotion, and would have knelt by him but he prevented me, and I fell upon his neck.— `Heavenly Father,' said he, raising his dark eyes in the starlight. `I obey! Caroline—look up! look up! thy star is in its wane!' `I see nothing unusual,' said I—`my star—where is it?' `What, nothing—nothing! look at its sulphurous hue, its flashing—there! there! does it not sensibly diminish—there! what sayest thou now, Caroline?' `Some cloud hath passed it,' said I, with a faltering voice, for I was intimidated by his manner, and affected by his wildness. `No, no,' said he, rising—`no cloud hath passed it. It was ever thus with mine.' `My brother! do not look so terribly upon me. I cannot bear the awful brightness of thine eyes. They frighten me,' said I, inconceivably terrified, and endeavouring to soothe him. `Caroline—Caroline!—Caroline!'—said he, in a loud voice—`listen!' `Caroline!' echoed back the mountain, in a sepulchral tone—`listen!' `I quaked in every limb—I could have covered my eyes, and leaped down the precipice for relief; but, with a strong hand Oscar held me, as he uttered, in a low voice, `Caroline, there is something preternatural in the darkening of thy star to-night. I feel a—nay, why tremble?—the commission has gone forth. I am summoned. Thou art summoned. I am commanded; and I shall obey!' `Obey!' answered the mountain. `Ha! art thou so near!' cried Oscar—`Lo! I am ready.' `Lo! I am ready!' answered the mountain, in a voice, so fearfully near and distinct, that I shrieked aloud!— innumerable shrieks followed! of such appalling and continued shrillness, as if a congregation of unhappy spirits had, all at once, uttered their voices in dismay and horrour. Oscar relinquished my hand, and fled from me a few paces. `What!' said he, `art thou too, sold to him! O Caroline! Caroline!' but he instantly returned, and of all that followed, I can only remember what I am now going to describe. For some time he held a conversation, in a loud and authoritative tone, as in remonstrance with the air—stood, and interrogated the mountain, and when the echo came back to him, he would reply again and again to it, as to something visible. All hope forsook me. I had never seen him so far gone. `The extinction of that star,' said he, in a lower voice, looking at the flat rock, and speaking as to some person sitting upon it, `is ominous. Thou art a hard master—yes! yes! thou canst not terrify me now—thou art! thou art!' `Look brother! look!' said I, willing, terrified as I was, to divert the dreadful fixedness of his eye to heaven—`Look! it is bright again!' `True,' said he, without lifting his eyes, or turning his head. `But I care not. It portends no re-illumination here. It is always thus; it foretells some calamity —some! do I not know what? Alas, too well—The Almighty is upon me. I must do it. She shall be saved —I care nothing for myself. Her hour has come!' `Her hour has come!' answered the echo, and Oscar stood upright before me, like a priest about to perform the rite of sacrifice. I shook from head to foot; my limbs tottered. A cold mist arose from my heart, and choked and blinded me The sweat dropped from my forehead upon my hands. Even now I can hear his voice, and see him standing before me, in my sleep; and I awake, night after night, half dead with terrour. It sounds like the breathed admonition of some dying man. He looks like some young martyr, that hath burst his sepulcre, and reappeared, for a more solemn repetition of his martyrdom. He comes, and looks, as from the charnel house—and my blood loiters now, even while thinking of him, in broad day-light, as if he were near—the current thickened and coagulated with his influence. VOL. II. 12 `Stop, stop!' said he, `I command thee, stop! Look again to that star—watch it—I will watch thine eyes at the same time—it will change, they will change. I will be believed. I will foretel the changes of both. Now look—it waxes dim—it vanishes—nay—nay, do not shut thy eyes, another will follow it!' Judge of my astonishment! It was so. The stars waned, one after the other, dropped, and went out! But how could he see it? His eyes were rivetted on mine. How could he foretel it?' `O, God!' cried Oscar, in that tone of melancholy, heartfelt tenderness, which I so loved—`That pale, lovely star, then, is blotted out! O, would that some other hand had quenched it! Night after night, have I watched it, studied it, wept before it, prayed to it! And now, O God, misfortune and weariness and sleeplessness have made me so wretchedly familiar with its changes, that I know them, and all its courses, as a parent the wandering of its little one. O, I feel its light in my heart; and now that it hath gone out, the chambers of my soul are dark!' `Hush!' said he, `there is a cloud passing the moon.' `No, brother—none, none!' said I. `There is! there is—I feel it.' `No, brother—it shines with the most innocent and spotless lustre—a liquid brightness.' `Nay, look again—we have yet a few minutes—look steadily—I tell thee girl that, anon—there! there! is not even her light dim and wavering.' Whether I was so affected by his disorder, as to be deceived, I cannot say; much may be justly attributed to the influence of terrour; and yet, at this moment, my blood runs cold, as I remember the appearance of the moon, while he spoke—its changes to me were like those of a human face, death-struck. `It is,' I cried, `it is—heaven and earth!—are they not clouds, brother?' `Clouds! no. It is ever thus. From my infancy, on this night—it is my birth night, Caroline.' `So it is!' I cried, and my heart leaped in my bosom; I would have kissed him, but he prevented me—repulsed me! `Nay, Caroline—I cannot endure thy kisses now— O, do not look at me thus! I cannot, cannot bear it. There is a duty to perform, which even now, I am hardly man enough to think of, but thy kisses would destroy me utterly. I could not perform it, if thy mouth had touched mine, to-night. So he says.' `That is my natal star,' he added, suddenly changing his voice—`and this my birth night. On this night, Caroline, I never knew that star-light cloudy or dim in heaven. Those intermittent flashes! these changes— do you know, sister, that they are prophetick?' `How so?' `They foretel my fortunes for the year. Nay, do not smile thus. Such a smile is awful in moonlight, on such an occasion. My experience is of many years. It is not of the heart. I never smiled here, but tears followed—tears of blood! You tremble, Caroline. A smile here is impious, blasphemous—we are in the presence of Jehovah, and his angels. A smile is ghastly, when the countenance contradicts the heart—when the eyes wrestle with the lip—do you believe me now?' `You think that I am mad. Others think so. I am not. I have been so, but I have recovered—look at my forehead—lay thy hand upon it—there! does that beating, that sweat and coldness speak plainly?' `My sister, if I had time, but I have not, I would tell thee how I purchased this terrible knowledge; why, in spite of reason, philosophy, reflection, scorn, and mockery, I have turned, amid all the suffering and humiliation of life, to this beautiful star—and that I turn to it still, no! to where it was, as to the star of Bethlehem: why, there has been ever, on the night of my birth, a prophetick delirium in my brain—and why, I am sick with terrour and dismay, if it falter or wane in its intelligent and lustrous beauty. No! no! not that way!' (I was gradually winning him toward the descent) `here is the path—there the pond, and yonder the fountain and seat. How this august repose affects me! The whole world sleeping below me, like the beings of another planet. The stars hovering around me and over me; the heavens turning round about us, over our heads and under our feet; and we, standing as in the centre of the universe, maintaining our sublime and solitary sway, over the fish of the sea, and the beast of the field, and the fowl of the air. Alas, how inefficient! when all our united force, all our wisdom, and all our policy, cannot stay or impede the smallest of yonder lights in its journeying. To be alone—so far above all the creatures of earth—to hold, as it were, a conversation with the stars, face to face, in their own audience chamber—to be in the presence of the living God—O, kneel with me, Caroline!' These were the symptoms that I looked for. The paroxysm, I now thought, had passed, and I answered `willingly, most willingly, chilly and damp as it is,— what a night for contemplation and worship!' `Dear Caroline!' said he, affectionately, touching his cold cheek to mine. I would have answered, but he continued, softly—`O, do not break this silence. Remember, dear, we are in the presence—the unencompassable throne is before us.' The silence became painful. `Brother,' said I, `speak to me—touch me—come nearer. I am terrified. I know not what this means, but I tremble all over. Let us go down—the eagles launch by us, as they return to earth: their highest nest is far below our feet.' `Not yet! there is a mist rising in the moonlight. That vault trembles with an approach. Footsteps are on the air. He cometh! lo, he cometh! O, I had half forgotten my trial. Lord be merciful to me, and to her —I will obey. For her sake, I will now do it. Nay, nay, if thine avenger is already at my side, bid him instruct me softly, for she is here.' `Brother, thy voice is frightful. Who is talking with thee: it has grown very dark since thou left me—where art thou? I cannot see thee. I hear other voice than thine,' said I, and I really believed what I said. `Caroline,' said he, solemnly, pressing his lips to my forehead; `Arise! I have a vow to perform.' His look I could not see, but his tone and attitude were composed and firm. `Knowest thou why we have ascended this mountain?' `O, yes! to look around us—to breathe the very air, and be wet to the heart, with the very dew of heaven, in its purity!' `True, but for other and more terrible purposes.' `What are they?' `For sacrifice!' said he, in a tone that made my heart retreat. `For sacrifice!' echoed I, faintly, but desperately, for I was choking. `For sacrifice!' answered the spirit of the place, approaching. `Silence, Caroline, and hear me. This night hast thou gazed with me on the star of my nativity. We have both, both seen it for the last time. Thou hast seen it quenched, utterly quenched—it dropped into the lake below. It was a portent. Thus am I to perish, perhaps in that very water—this knife—nay, stand up, Caroline, there is no help for thee' (I shut my eyes, as a dark, glimmering flourish passed before them, and fell at his feet—all the horrours of my situation broke, at once, upon me;) `Nay, come to it boldly, Caroline. Thou art no dastard. I have seen thee do braver things. Arise! I say, kneel not to me, no! there is thy Saviour! kneel to him—behold him, where he sits, throned in the bluest sky, beyond the darkness! I can see him plainly; address thy prayers to Him! He will hear thee, dear: drooping, drooping still! and I too! where am I? Does my heart fail me? why these yearnings and tuggings?' `O Caroline, how it bleeds for thee; would I could strike thee, while thou art insensible; but I must not. The vow would not be accomplished, the price not paid.' (He thought me insensible, but I was not, for I heard it all; his words rang in my ears, and I never forgot them. It appeared to me that he wept, and that his dark eyes shot flames into my heart, at the same moment.) `But no, no! I may not. Thou wilt recover: thou shalt! I will not kill thee sleeping. Thy spirit shall go before thy Saviour, awake, imploringly, serenely, 12* and perfect in its preparation! Awake! my sister, awake! Here on the high mountain top, I call to thee! Awake! she stirs,—this blade hath already drunk deep of innocent blood; be this mine expiation!' `My brother! my brother!' I cried, clinging to his knees; `O spare me! I have trusted thee, I alone, of all the world. I have defended thee, and wept for thee, with the truest heart; I alone, of all that have known thee, I alone have continued to love thee; and canst thou kill me! Canst thou spill the blood of the only heart on earth, that does not quake at thy voice, and hide itself at thy tread? In thy delirium, who hath been thy companion? In thy sickness, and suffering, who hath watched and tended thee? In thy nakedness and desolation, who hath been always near thee? In sorrow, and guilt and madness, who? When all the world hated thee, and scorned and mocked at thee, who laid her head upon thy bosom, and cried herself asleep in thy arms? When all doubted and dreaded, naked and helpless as I was, was not my heart always open to thee, poor maniac!' `And can it be! Have I trusted myself to thee, thus far, in all thy terrible moods; have I wandered with thee, till now, barefooted, over the precipice and the torrent, even while that deadly light shone in thine eyes, and the mortal paleness of thy lip, made thy very dogs avoid thee, have I? To perish now! How wholly have I confided in thee, doubting thee not; fearing thee not; sleeping by thy side, while the point of thy dagger or thy pistol touched my breast; believing always in thy love for me, and sure of thy restoration! O, have I endured all this! all! and canst thou, when all is past, canst thou kill me!' `His tears fell upon my face.' `My dear, dear sister!' he replied, in a trembling voice, so deeply pathetick and musical that, would you believe it, I felt, in a measure, reconciled for a moment to my fate; it was so tender, so loving, so mournful! that, mistaken he might be, but I was sure that if he killed me, it would be out of his great love to me,— `How I have loved thee, God is my witness! Just so I loved the angel of my childhood, but I slew her. Why? That her star, once quenched in blood, might burn on, forever and ever, in heaven, unquenchably. Did I love thee, Caroline, less tenderly, less distractedly, with a less suffocating devotion to thine everlasting happiness, I would not put thee to sleep with mine own hand. I could not! I should bid thee do it, and if thou wert told all, thou wouldst obey me, and go, a self-murderess, to the bar of judgment; thy beautiful bosom lacerated, and gushing with the unholy retribution of thine own hand. O, I would leave thee, my sister, behind me, did I love thee less. I cannot go alone, alone and unsupported, before the tribunal of the skies. Thy innocence will support me, and, my love, He knows, is the cause of this unnatural crime, dear Caroline!' `O, my brother! my brother! do not kill me! Father of mercies, restore him! O, withhold his hand! Receive my spirit! and do not thou require my blood at his dear hands! attribute not my death to aught but love, and affection! And O, withhold his weapon from his own heart!' `Caroline,' said he, `thou art mistaken. My appointed time is come. My commission is expired. I am reclaimed, repurchased. A good spirit has been with me, and bought me away forever, for the enemy of mankind. Before the revolution of another year, I shall have received my judgment. Can I leave thee? yet do not believe that I shall lift mine own hand against mine own life. I am forbidden to spill my blood. Perhaps, I am journeying to morrow to a far country— perhaps I am not forbidden to die, without spilling my blood. Would that I knew it now!—O, how readily would I plunge into that dark water below, with thee in my arms, dear, just where my star fell, and was quenched. Prepare thyself; the hour has passed. The moon shines out, as I was promised—forgive me, Caroline; wilt thou?' `I do, I do forgive thee, I answered, while he pressed his lips to my forehead, and shut my eyes, as the knife gleamed in the star-light—another moment, and it had been buried in my heart; but heaven, that never, never, will abandon one that trusts to it, inspired me with a sudden thought; I fell upon my face, and counterfeiting another voice, shouted, as loud as I could—`forbear!' `Forbear! forbear! forbear!' echoed the mountain. The knife fell from his hand; stuck into the earth at my feet, and quivered. I plucked it out, and hurled it into the lake. He observed the action, but stood motionless, with his hands extended toward the heaven: and then, bowed thrice. `Am I to forbear; forever?' said he, in a low voice. `Forbear, forever,' said the echo, faintly. `Forever, and ever!' answered I, aloud, with my hands over my mouth. `Forever, and ever—forever, and ever!' echoed the mountain. Thanks be to God! may I never forget that moment. I was safe. Oscar caught me to his bosom. `I am absolved,' said he, forever, and ever!' `Forever, and ever!' answered the mountain, immediately, in the very tones of a near human voice, suppressed, and agitated—I confess, that I was startled; I, who knew the cause; but it seemed that I could never become familiar with its variety of voices. We descended—O, I was the happiest of human beings. The noise of our descent came about us, like thunder. We heard, as we thought, some one following us. Oscar seated me upon a rock, and stood, for a moment, watching the sound, like a lion preparing to leap upon his prey. `I know thee, shape of hell,' he cried; I know thee, thou accursed one, and I defy thee! baffled, baffled!' `Baffled! baffled! baffled!' replied the echo, growing fainter, and fainter, like the voice of an ascending and retreating spirit. Oscar clapped his hands, and laughed in derision. The noise awoke all the caverns and solitudes, it seemed, within the circumference of heaven, for they rang all about us, with incessant reverberation, like a rejoicing multitude, for many seconds. `Caroline, thou blessed one; let us hasten from this accursed place. The fiends are rejoicing with me, but I cannot bear it. I abjure them all. My soul is free! I forswear the place!' Is it not extraordinary?—this stratagem, directed at the root of my brother's melody, restored him. He never relapsed afterwards. But the cause was as singular; you have heard it perhaps: He had been out in the morning: when he returned, the tenants observed a certain wildness in his air, and that he passed them without seeing them, or even hearing them, when he addressed him. What he saw, we know not; but he never spoke again for a whole year. The consequence of — — — — —`A heart.'— — — Such was the manuscript. Harold was amazed at many resemblances between the feelings of Oscar, as described, and his own. He was sleepy; but nevertheless, in the distempered ardour of his curiosity, he tore the other package apart, which was tied with a blue ribbon, that stuck together, probably with the red cement of some breast, that had spouted upon it. They were letters: and numbered, and dated, showing the progress of Oscar's acquaintance with Elvira. The first was dated, `February, 8th,' and commenced abruptly, after this fashion. `I have seen her. Is she beautiful? no. Wonderful?—no. What is there then, about her sweet lips, to remind me of the bright intelligence that haunted me in my boyhood? Is it that loftiness, purity, that throned and sceptred something, on her forehead? I know not. I only know that I tremble— can you believe me? at her approach. I do not speak to her, I dare not. My voice would be inarticulate, if I should attempt it. My temples would beat; nay, they do beat, at this moment, at the thought of it. Why do I not arise and startle, and astonish her? She is young, artless, inexperienced, and thrilling with sensibility. Where are my powers? vanished! quelled! I cannot trifle with her; and you know, Oxford, that she is the only woman that I ever knew, whom I could not trifle with. I shall watch her narrowly. She is helpless, timid, and dangerously situated. May I not place her where she deserves to be? But, there are suspicions in my mind. I am afraid that her heart is pre-occupied. I shall see, and if I find it so, farewell, to her, forever.' March 25th—No! her heart is untouched. I rejoice that it is so. The conquest of such a woman is no light triumph. I believe that I shall attempt it. But how? why? honourably, or may heaven reduce me to ashes, with the first impure thought that arises in my heart! why? that I may make her happier. She pretends that she will never be married. I look her in the face when she says this, and portray the solitariness of a single life, particularly to a woman—as an unnatural widowhood, and wonder at her composure, so innocent, so unaffected, as she listens to me. I think that I shall try hard to change her resolution. We had a conversation last evening, upon the subject of matrimony. I avoid all particularity in my approaches, and pay her pretty cousin much more attention than her; carefully watching, and studying her deportment with others. I am sure that she does not suspect me; nor do I mean that she shall, till I can see my way clear. But, as I was telling you, we were chatting, somewhat earnestly upon matters and things in general, when I purposely, and I think, adroitly, led the subject of conversation to celibacy. My remarks had some effect, I am sure. She had never thought deeply on the sorrow and desolation of a single life; but she had spent much time in meditating upon those of the married. `Surely, said she, `there is no reason why an old maid may not be cheerful, kind-hearted, and agreeable.' Indeed, there is,' said I; `all these qualities in an old maid, only render her a fitter subject of derision. If she be kind and agreeable, the world charge her with attempting to win a husband by artifice. All that another would do spontaneously, will be attributed to consummate address in her. If she be dignified and reserved, she is called stiff and prudish; if lively and spirited, girlish, and flippant; until all her pretensions are ridiculed, and all her best actions misinterpreted. This is all true, Oxford, is it not?' I have frightened her by my temper. You know that I am not fretful, peevish, or sullen, or cold; but my silent haughtiness often appears like sullenness; and my sudden explosions, if not petulance, are worse; or more terrible. Perhaps the worst of it is, that I appear to remember wrong, and feel hostility, long after I have forgotten and forgiven. For, when once my countenance is touched with solemnity, I do confess that it is no easy matter to change it. I have walked with her, and find her mind what I looked for—chaste, elevated, and singularly perspicuous. She has remarkable self-possession too, I find. I am compelled to respect her, even more than I—yes, I may at well say it, love her! for I do feel now, that I am beginning to love her. A strange, pure, tenderness is swelling out of my heart, like fountains that flow at the sound of musick, when I hear her voice. April 1st—Is the day auspicious? you are welcome now, in answer to the inquiries of them that love me, to say that I have at length found the woman, whom, if I can, I will make my wife. I am in great doubt. I am far from being confident that I shall be accepted. Sometimes I fear that I have deceived myself, and that the brief emotion that I have sometimes detected, when I was near her, was altogether illusory or accidental. Perhaps I have mistaken friendship for tenderness. I hope not. By heaven, I would rather die. I know not what will become of me. This suspense is insupportable. I am assailed on all sides. Is it honourable to keep her in ignorance of my designs? Is it safe? were it not wiser and more worthy of me to try my fate at once? If she say no, the sooner she says it, the better; and I shall not ask her to say yes. Enough for me, if she will not refuse me, at once. I will answer for the rest, if she once let me get a footing in her heart! Yes! I know myself too well to think that I should ever deserve to forfeit it. Could she banish me then? no, never, never, if she be really worthy of me. Midnight—do I love her? yes, I do; but it is with a strange, indefinite, delightful feeling. I have loved before. That love was a passion. This is not. This is a religion. In the presence of Elvira, I have felt, I know not what, a kind of purifying and sublimating intellectual process going forward, within the chambers of my soul. What would I do? I know not. Could I make her happy? I ask myself this question a thousand times in a day; and I answer as often, yes! yes! I could, if a love, as pure and deep, as ever occupied the heart of man; a constancy, as capable of enduring all temptations, and all trials as ever was, may do it, I could make her happy. Would I part with her? yes, this moment, if parting with her would make her happier. Nay, Oxford, I would give her to thee, to any man, whom I thought worthy of her, without one tear, that she should see, or one pulsation of my arteries, more or less, that should ever be known, were I assured that thou or another could make her happier than I can. Such is my love! call it not romantick. It is not. It is higher, nobler. I would pluck her away from the vile rabble that beset her; I would place her, where they cannot, among the great. But can I? yea. Thou knowest, Oxford, that I have that within me which convinces me of my power to place whom I will, almost where I will. April 10th—I thank you, Oxford, for your advice. That, and your solicitude are abundant manifestations of your good opinion. No, I have not spoken falsely. I have only concealed some circumstances, which, at some future day, I shall disclose. `Can I make her happy? am I sure of it?' you ask. I see the cause of your disquietude. You are afraid of my attachment to— I do not trust myself to write her name, lest some accident should happen to the letter. But, be you assured, guilty as I have been there, that I shall never offer my hand to this woman, till I am sure that my heart is utterly purged of all its impurities, and of all its desires, so far as she is concerned. I am now about to let her guardian understand my purpose. The sooner, the better for him; it will put him upon inquiry, and prevent any unpleasant reproaches, hereafter. Farewell, for to-night; to-morrow, I shall address him on the subject. It is done. I have explained my views. He does not object, and of course, I am so far in smooth water. But have I advanced one jot? I see no encouragement that would justify me in declaring- for if—God of heaven! if I should fail, I should go distracted. No, no, I won't. I will not advance, till I see a hand open to greet me; let the world say what it will, I can better bear importunity than humiliation—self-humiliation. `Is she ambitious,' you ask. Yes, but her ambition is of a more quiet aspect, and temperature than mine. Her ambition, I think, would be to make me, if she chose me, consummately happy. This would content her. But, I would have her not only happy, but great. Yet I think she has the courage, and I know she has the capacity, to go with me, hand in hand, upon any pilgrimage. Yes, Oxford, I believe that she would attend me to the field of battle, though she would turn pale and sick at the sight of blood: and toil, and die for me; stand by me in the war; nurse me on the bed of death; receive my last kiss at the scaffold, or the block; and withhold her tears, should I be arraigned for rebellion. O, Elvira, thy proud heart would beat high at the blast of that trumpet, which I have heard, nightly, for many years—but thou wouldst quake to think of what it summons me to, and what I am determined to encounter. Gracious god! she loves me. I cannot believe my senses. Yet I must believe this, for I am told it by one whom I cannot doubt. `Can I abandon her?' you ask— O, no; hardly, I fear, even if she were unworthy. No, I should deserve to be burnt by the lightnings of heaven, could I trifle with, or abandon such a creature. No, if we ever part, it shall be her will, not mine. I would not, could not, leave her, unless she bad me leave her; and then, I should obey, merely that she might be the happier. I have made up my mind. She has heard some unfavourable things of me. I shall tell her the truth. But how? am I authorised to make myself the subject VOL. II. 13 of my communications? How know I that she will endure it? Pshaw! what coquetry. I know that she will listen to me. I am determined. I have done some things unworthy of her; but I will tell her with my own lips, what they are—if she forgive me, well; if not, why then, farewell. It is done! thank heaven! it is done. I have revealed myself, and am not rejected. O, how full my heart is! I cannot talk, I cannot even write—my hand is unsteady, and the letters glimmer like a mist before my eyes —tears! yes, tears are upon the paper—it is blistered, as you see, all over; but they are tears, not of sorrow, not of humiliation, but of love, and tenderness, unutterable—farewell, awhile; when I am more composed, I shall— — — — — When I put myself in her guardian's power, I told him, that, if he refused me, it was enough. I should submit. He was the best judge of her happiness, and I should ask no questions. He might have reasons enough to determine him, without being at liberty to mention them. And so I told her. If she said no, she could not say it too soon; and I should submit, without a murmur. In that case, she was to consult nobody. If otherwise, if she hesitated, for I did not wish her to say yes, until she knew me better, I entreated her to consult whom she would. — — — — — — — I have disclosed the facts, but I am afraid that she is deceived. I hope not, for I have put all the letters into her hand, and asked her in so many words—`Have you any questions to ask—any? Are all your fears to this point only, whether I yet love or have loved that woman? If they are, I can answer you at once, without trembling. I never did love her. I do not love her. It was a terrible trial to her, nevertheless. She was sick with her love and apprehension. I am now satisfied. She has no more ordeals of that nature to endure. But one or two remain—her constancy under absence and neglect; and her love, even when she believes me yet more violent than I am, in my temper. Do you blame me? You cannot. How often have you heard my determination, and approved it, never to marry any woman, to whom my whole past life had not been laid open, nakedly, and without concealment; any woman who does not know every vicious and evil propensity of my nature. True, I may not reveal them all at once; that were too terrible—but before I marry, she shall assuredly think me worse than I am. That will try her love and constancy; will it not? — — — — — Her only prayer is now, that `we may live and die together;' I use her own words---lie side by side, in the same grave, locked in each other's arms. But who shall be the survivor? that thought makes her tremble. — — — — — — — — How provoking, is'nt it Oxford, when a lovely creature has been silent a long time, and your heart is overflowing with sympathy, as you persuade her to lift up her beautiful eyes once more, which you expect to see swimming in luminous moisture, to find them perfectly dry, and wondering at your agitation. My advice in such a case is, that a fellow should slily wet the ends of his fingers, no matter how, and moisten his lashes therewith—it would be inexpressibly touching, and might lead to a very tender eclaircissement. But away with this—I cannot trifle, where she or aught that concerns her, is the theme—no, there is something of tenderness and solemnity, so sanctified and tranquil about her, that I cannot. May 2nd—What a woman she is, Oxford! so pure, so elevated. Am I worthy of her? Indeed I am now, but I have not always been. Should she know this, exaggerated as it will be, under the reproachful testimony of my own heart? She should; but does she? No, she does not. I have deceived her, unintentionally, it is true, and where I wanted her to know the truth, and I cannot bear to undeceive her. I have let her cheat herself, and can I, ought I, to tear away the delusion;— what good purpose can it answer? I know not, and yet, one maxim governs me. She shall be undeceived before we are married; so that she may be able to say then, when any babbling gossip shall invade her ears with some story of me; `No, I do not believe it, for he never told me of it!' That shall be the confidence that my wife shall feel. Let others shrink, if they will, from it. I will not. And what is strange, while I do this, I do not ask it; I do not wish it of her! Of one thing I can assure you, seriously; my temper, so far as I can judge, is materially improved, kinder, and less easily agitated. What then should I hope from a union with this woman, if an acquaintance so short as ours, has already affected so much? Is there aught that she could not do? Of the relations and character, standing and property of all parties, I have only one or two words to say to you. I am not mercenary, as you know well, and it would be idle for me to tell one, who has been my companion so long, that wealth and rank, without affection and talent, are of no value to me. Without the two former, I can be happy: without the two latter, I should be miserable. It is true that my limited patrimony would have to be husbanded in the most frugal manner, to support us properly; and should any accident, the death of their natural guardian, throw a certain helpless family, to which she is nearly related, upon the world, I should be their only protector. I have thought of all this—I have thought on the possibility, nay, the probability, that she might be visited by another lingering and protracted illness, an event that would go nigh to drive me distracted now, were we, or were we not married: I have reflected, till my eyes overflowed, on the tenderness of her nature, and the necessity of unremitting gentleness and indulgence on my part, amid all the perils of my profession, and all the uncertainties of absence. And yet, I am ready to marry her, not immediately, but after a reasonable time has elapsed, when she will be safe in her knowledge of me. I know her better than she knows me; and were it not for my wish to have nothing at risk, that can affect her, I would marry her to-morrow. You are surprised at the suddenness of my resolution, you say. My friend, if you had thought as many hours upon this subject, as I have days, you would approve my determination. I used to think differently, but I am now convinced that it is the duty of a man to marry young. Amid many reasons, the following may be worth your thought for a moment. When we are young, we more easily assimilate; our sensibilities and sympathies are more attractive:—Our habits and opinions less obstinate. But what is of the greatest importance, we have a better chance of educating our children, forming their characters, and directing their establishment in the world. My views of this subject, have become peculiarly solemn of late. I have reflected till my heart ached, and the life ebbed out of it, on the dreadful consequences of leaving a youthful woman, helpless and burdened with young children, upon the unhallowed mercy, and cold charity of the world. How often, no matter what may be her situation, how often is she obliged to prostitute herself, to a second man, merely for the protection of her babes! She could endure the desolation of widowhood, take comfort in her bereavement, were her children dead and buried, or were her sons and daughters fashioned and prepared for conflicting with the ruder elements of society, in their commotion; but they are young, and helpless, and while her heart shrinks and withers, at the thought of permitting the caresses of any other than him, who is in his grave, she is obliged to be won, obliged to have the solitudes of her affection trodden by an unwelcome, confident footstep; obliged to give herself another husband, against all the yearning of her heart; all the revolting sensations that arise, when memory touches upon the past, with all its endearment—merely that her babes may have a father. Is it not shocking! Oxford; I would rather that my wife should die in my arms, and that my child should die at her bosom, while I had life enough to see it! I should know then that they were translated beyond this damnable cruelty and temptation: 13* no more—I cannot write any more—no widow of mine shall be resold, no treasury rifled— May 5. She will have to abide that other trial, after all. I have made up my mind to it, much as I love her; and I cannot suppress my tears, as I tell you that if she falter, I will leave her, forever. The promise was deliberately made. I warned her then, of the consequences. I predicted all that has happened—all this importunity; all this misconstruction; but still she promised. The original question is now merged in another. I care little about that, but this is of vital importance; no other, indeed, than whether she shall keep her word, when deliberately pledged. I tremble, Oxford: I tremble for her, but I am resolved. You shall hear the result. It will be determined, before I sleep. — 6. Thank God, thank God! my dear friend! I have prevailed; or rather she has prevailed. What an heroick girl! I love her more than ever. After the trial was over, I told her what had been my resolution. She was thunderstruck. But how could I marry a woman whose word, whose resolution, was to be doubted? I could not. I might have gone crazy, and I am sure that I should, if we were to be parted by any unworthiness in her, but I would never have touched her hand again, had she faltered. I left her last evening, after a singular conversation, but a very necessary one. We were speaking of the innumerable accidents, such as death or sickness, misrepresentation, interference of friends, enemies, that so often tear asunder hearts that have almost grown together. `It is possible,' said I, in conclusion, `dear Elvira, that we may not be married after all.' `Yes,' she replied, `I think it very probable.' `O, no,' said I, smiling at her meek acquiescence, `not probable, but it is possible. And now, I have a pledge to exchange, while our thoughts are turned to such an event. We are both proud, and, a resolution once taken, may be perpetual. Let us agree not to come to any determination respecting each other, if any such event should, by any possibility, occur, until each has had an opportunity of being heard. Let us believe nothing but what comes from each other. If I do aught unworthy of you, I will be the first to tell you of it, and throw up your hand. She agreed to this, cordially and immediately. This led her to inform me that she had been cautioned against me, with much emphasis; and told that my views were not serious; that I had trifled with many women, and would trifle with her. I trembled as she said this, because I was convinced that, if she had the slightest suspicion of that sort, she would, to avoid all risk herself, dismiss me, on the first plausible pretext that offered. This is the nature of women; they become coquettes, lest they should be coquetted. However, I was able to assure her, entirely, on that score. `She had never doubted my sincerity, and probably never should;' were her words. What could be more noble and frank? I would detain you longer on this subject, dear Oxford, but I know the propensity of lovers, and am on my guard against it. Still, however, there is one circumstance, that I cannot easily resist the temptation of telling. It is her own character in the fewest possible words. A very dear friend of hers, who was entitled to all her love and veneration, one who was almost a mother to her indeed, in a long conversation lately, of which I was the subject, made this remark among many others: `You must have a great deal of courage, child, to think of marrying him.' In her innocence and simplicity, she told me this. What could I say? Are you prepared to conjecture? I told her, that it was true—that the woman who married me, must have a great deal of courage; and that she, who gave her the advice, which the remark implied, was entitled to all her confidence and respect. And yet, for my magnanimity had carried me quite far enough then, I thought! I begged her to recall, if she could, any look, or tone, or expression of mine, that resembled unkindness to her, during all our love, beginning at our earliest acquaintance—nay, I told her that, if by any calamity I should ever appear unkind to her, I felt assured that it would be only appearance, whatever I suffered. I might leave her, I might die, but I could not wound her, I was sure. But enough of this: the stuff of your sentimental creatures, I have always felt an unconquerable loathing for, and I am not so blindly infatuated, as to imagine that mine is much less sickening than that of others. So, farewell, for the present. I must continue to keep you informed, I find, under pretence of relieving your apprehensions concerning this affair, but in reality, to relieve my own heart. I am in solitude, and she is the only companion of my thought. I should scorn to make many persons on this earth, acquainted with my contemplations on any subject, and last of all, on this! and yet, I find no enjoyment so tranquillizing as this of communicating to you, dear Oxford, all that I think, or feel in relation to Elvira. The time of her most terrible trial approaches. I cannot but be agitated when I reflect on the possible consequences. Sometimes my heart upbraids me, for risking aught, and I am even tempted to forbear, what I am sure is not an act of cruelty or duty, but rather one of necessity. You know that I would ask no sacrifice that I would not make—that I would put no one to any trial, which I would not cheerfully endure myself. If she come out bright from this ordeal, her perils in marriage will end, where those of the world generally begin. The husband, I am sure, will be more indulgent than the lover. It has always been my maxim, for which, by the way, you are not the only one who has reproached me, to begin so low, that I cannot fall, in the estimation of her, whose love I would win. I would rather never rise, than fall—rather never be loved, than loved and forgotten. I have put the letters, of which you have so frequently spoken, all, all! even yours and Emily's, where you have treated me with the most severity and earnestness, into her hands. I need not tell you the result. She loves too much to be easily wrested away. She was troubled, and sick, but she forgave me. But one question still presents itself before me; does she yet suspect the extent of my intimacy with—? I know not. Sometimes I persuade myself that she does, and that she benignantly shuts her eyes upon all that is past. But this is only a hope. I am not a coward, you know, Oxford; I am not disingenuous; and yet, in this case, I fear to act entirely like a man; and I persuade myself that it is to avoid shocking her innocent nature. But tell me; ought I to disclose the whole, in plain terms? In one of the letters, are these very expressions: can they be misunderstood? `Do you ever dream of me? With me, there is scarce a night, but my spirit sees and converses with yours. I hear you talk; I feel your touch, and press you to my aching heart; but when I awake, and find it all illusion, I could almost weep tears of blood.' Suppose I should tell her, at once, in so many words, that I have sinned. Would it not seem a defiance? And after all, what signifies the past? Since I have known her, I have never wandered in thought, or word or deed. This was long before, after I had seen her, it is true, but long before we ever met; and of a nature, so utterly within mine own keeping, that it could never be known but by my own voluntary confession. What have I to fear then? you will ask. My friend, I know not. This woman is not fashioned like other women. I cannot reason therefore, respecting her, from my knowledge of them; and I feel an unaccountable alarm when this thought obtrudes itself upon my contemplation. Returning lately from a walk, during which I had been so happy, that my eyes glistened, and my heart heaved with a new feeling, a feeling of kindness and love to every human being, with a dash of piety that was not common with me, till of late—we, by some accident, fell upon a conversation respecting deception. and I, unthinkingly made this avowal, `that I could deceive any body, if I would.' This was a piece of unnatural and childish boasting in me, and I repented, as soon as it had passed my lips. Not that I had said what was false, but it was unnecessary; and Elvira had not then known me sufficiently long, to feel that confidence, which she will feel, one day or other, in my principles. It struck her with unexpected force: I could perceive it, and though I strove to dissipate the shadow that it had thrown upon the brightest spot of her affections, I am sure that I did not succeed. A most unwelcome suspicion, that she strove to quell, with all her force, but in vain, immediately arose in her innocent heart. What a blockhead I was! All her experience had been in my favour. She had the most sublime and affecting confidence in me, till that moment; and now, though she loves me perhaps more tenderly than ever, I am sure, by the trembling of her lips, and her lamping eyes, that her heart is in a tremour. I told her that if I deceive her, I deceive myself, and must therefore be consummately foolish; and that if I deceive her, she will never be undeceived, unless I wish to escape from her. How unlucky! every word that I added, in the way of explanation, only served to make matters worse, and I left her with a far less contented spirit than usual. Of that vile habit which I have mentioned to you, she has given her decided opinion at last, in a manner worthy of her. How singular! that one so pure, so meek, so sensitive, should have been so little prepared for the shock that she experienced. I felt that no human being, but myself, ought to approach her with familiarity; that she, for I was so, should be consecrate to one alone. The hour was one of the bitterest of my life, when I saw him touch her cheek. I could have prevented it, easily, but no! I chose to leave that to her own discretion. She yielded, in my presence, to be sure, and in the presence of his own wife; and, had it not been, that I had never made her acquainted with my sentiments on that subject, by heaven, I would have left her on the spot, if every blood vessel of my body had been reptured by the separation. She perceived the effect, and felt it. I was silent: suffocating: you can imagine the reason, knowing my earlier history: but I was able, at last, to speak a few plain words to this inestimable creature. They were effectual. Her resolution was taken, and will be kept. `Why, really,' said she, I never thought of it, before. He is as a brother to me always. `No,' I replied, `you are mistaken, brothers are not so fond. Besides, such a favour ought to be considered inestimable. It should be reserved for one, and one only. The lips of no woman should be touched, when she loves, but by him she loves. `Lips!' said she, in surprise: was'nt I delighted! Her lips were sacred to me! `I would not thank any woman for any favour that another could share in,' said I. `Either it is an especial, thrilling privilege, or it is not. If it be not, then these friends, brothers, cousins, uncles, &amp;c. cannot complain, if it be refused. If it be, then is the lover, or the husband only, entitled to it. But all this did not seem to satisfy her that I was reasonable; she considered my opinion extravagant. One only argument remained; `Do as thou wouldst be done by' said I. `What would be your sensations to behold me caressing other women, and clinging to their lips or cheeks, because they happened to be friends or relations?' This was enough! I felt an involuntary pressure of my arm; and an inarticulate murmur broke from her lips, as if her dear heart stopped all at once, at the thought. So that affair is settled, and forever! You speak harshly, Oxford, but I deserve it. Am I then the guilty creature that you imagine? No, I am not so base. This you will acknowledge, one day or other. At present, I cannot hope it; you are indignant at the deception that I have practised, and I cannot blame you: but the time will come, when a more temperate judgment will pronounce that I am more deserving of your love and esteem than ever. You speak of seduction. Whom have I seduced? None. Whom of the young, and the innocent, have I breathed upon, and blasted? What mother have I plucked from her children; what wife from her husband? what child from her parent? None! none! and I thank my God that I have not. But am I altogether what I should be? Oh no! in shame and sorrow I confess it, I am not. But hear the whole. She was heart sick of late, and I! I was near to death and distraction. She charged me with loving — yet, I denied it, and I spoke the truth. But my heart smote me, as I remembered the letters which that extraordinary woman had to exhibit against me. They were ardent, impassioned, burning; but were they true or false? If true, then I had loved her, and was fickle. If false, then was I capable of the most cruel deceit. So you would reason. And yet, Oxford, by my hope of heaven, I never loved that woman; nor did I wish to deceive her, except for her benefit, here and hereafter. She was very dear to me, I confess it; and my hand often shook when I wrote to her, but it was solely because she was helpless, desolate, and in despair, dependent upon me, so young and headstrong, for all that made life dear to her. Thus, without counterfeiting a passion that I did not feel, I do confess that I wrote more warmly than I felt, and often so indiscreetly, that I cannot expect my protestations now, to be taken by any body but you, when I aver, upon my honour, that I never loved her, and never meant to deceive her. You know, Oxford, that I am no libertine; that sensuality has no temptation for me; that I scorn the ribald profligacy of young men, and that no woman could ever keep me in thraldom for an hour, unless her very heart and soul were pure, beyond suspicion. But how can I convince Elvira of this? Will she believe that I have never been guilty, as I would not be, for the world, in weightier matters. Let me speak boldly then; my sin is venial. It is not long that I have considered it any sin at all. Hitherto it has been with me rather a question of prudence, than morality; and when I have yielded, it has been, not from any constitutional predisposition, not from any natural tendency to licentiousness, for I loathe and scorn it all; but merely as a matter of inconsiderateness or curiosity, as we sometimes drink more wine than we ought. But women look upon the affair in a more serious light. Why? They remember the deadly, corrosive, and dissolving nature of that poison, with which the reputation of woman is sprinkled when she has erred. But this is not a fair estimate for man. Look into society. What only renders a man more an object of curiosity and attraction, (it is in vain to deny it; the faculties of seduction are courted to their employment, even by the wise;) is death and horrour to a woman. What gives him a passport to celebrity, as a fascinating creature, whom it is difficult to resist, and in the society of whom, it is so miraculous to be chaste, that women are impatient to demonstrate it, by putting themselves in his way, will blast the life and beauty of a woman, and wither all the blossom and fruit of her family, poison forever the fountain of her being, and give her name to the world, as a bye-word and a reproach. Accursed partiality! Why is not the man execrated, trampled on, hated and shunned! and the poor broken-hearted woman, upon whose head, as she flies with dishevelled hair, and aching temples, before the malediction of society, all the vials of heaven's wrath are successively discharged; desolation, widowhood, nakedness, shame, sickness, and death, with all the pangs of the mother, unhusbanded, unshielded, unsustained in her agony of humiliation! why is not she pitied and prayed for? If one be married, it is true, that there is a seeming difference. If the husband break his vows, the rich overflowing of a parent's affection is not poured out, upon the head of shame and dishonour; the wife is not abused in her affections, and left to nourish, and weep VOL. II. 14 and pray over the offspring of perjury and lust. Not so, if the wife be unfaithful. The deluded husband may toil onward, night and day, in blood and sweat, for the creatures, whose very breathing is an augmentation of his dishonour: and the babes of his own blood, the children of his own loins, may be defrauded of their patrimony by the spurious issue of corruption and shame. Where people are married, therefore, there is a reason why the same transgression in the woman should be visited with a more vindictive and terrible punishment, than that of the man. But with the unmarried, no such reason exists. Then why do not the wise and virtuous discountenance the misdeeds of men, in a manner as peremptory, as they do those of women? The errour lies in the constitution of society, and it is now too late to reform it. Enough for me, no matter what may be the act in itself, enough for me, that society has made this sin a greater crime in woman, than in man. What constitutes a crime? The transgression of some law. That is evidently considered the greater crime, to which the greater penalty is attached. What is the penalty in this case? To woman, it is reprobation and death. But what is it to man? A subject scarcely of serious remonstrance, in general, and never, of downright exclusion from society. Now it matters not what may have been the act, to which society had affixed this penalty of opprobrium and dishonour; let it be ever so innocent and natural; such, if you please, as going abroad without a veil, (which is the last indecency in Turkey,) and the woman, who wilfully violates the law, becomes, thereby entirely worthy of the punishment. Why? Because she manifests her disregard for the opinion and interdict of society: and if this disregard be so contemptuous and efficient, that it leads her to do what that society denounces, as shameless and unpardonable, she thereby shows a spirit, that must be fatal to all government; and, on the other hand, if she cannot resist the temptation to do what the law forbids, under so tremendous an injunction, no matter what the prohibited act may be, she proves thereby that she is not to be trusted. In either case, therefore, she deserves the punishment which she receives. The penalty is the measure of guilt. Now let us apply this. I admit that this sin is, in itself, alike in man and woman, separate I mean, from the laws of society. But those laws have made it greater in her, inconceivably greater: and this they can do. It is the office of law to define and cause transgression; for without law, there could be none. A woman, therefore, who transgresses, does so, knowing from her earliest infancy, that, from that moment she is lost, utterly lost and forsaken—shut out from society—banished from all hearts—pursued with execration and abhorrence—doomed, in all probability, to wear out her life in the company of the lewd and the profane; and dissolve, at last, a pestilential and detestable mass of festering corruption. This a woman knows, when she sins. Is it then of any consequence what the sin is? Indeed, it is not. Her guilty disregard to publick opinion, and her utter inability to resist temptation, are conspicuous alike, whatever may be the sin, if the penalty be the same. But is it so with man? What is the penalty for him? I do not ask what it ought to be, but what it is. Is his character blasted? No! Do the virtuous shrink from his countenance, as from pollution? No! Are daughters, and sisters and wives prohibited to his approach? No! Are there any confederacies of the pure in heart, to blast and scathe the villain, if he dare to profane their abiding places? No! Is the fire side darkened when he appears? Are the household deities veiled? Do they quake and crumble, of themselves, when he invades their sanctuary? No—no! Do mothers avoid him as the pestilence—and daughters, as one, whose coming is an unholy portent to their reputation? whose very touch is unclean? whose thought is so polluted, that she who is thought of, that moment is deflowered and defiled— and may not purify herself, but by prayer and weeping? as one, before whose voice the intellect sickens, and shivers with dismay—instinctively shuddering at the approach of sensuality, as at the touch of rottenness and death? No!—But he is left to infuse his drugs before our very eyes, into the wine-press of our joys, though we know that they are a mortal poison, and we feel that, when they are thrown in among our myrrh and frankincense, they blind and deafen the understanding—and we see that the golden vessels themselves, the chalice, and bowl, and censer, of our family worship, as if conscious of their profanation, darken and weep in their places, as the thick, hot vapour gathers about them, and is condensed by their coldness and purity. No—nothing of this. The most rigid forgive him. The curses of the father, the brother, the bereaved and dishonoured mother, are heard only, at intervals, and faintly, upon his track along the world; and the villain scarcely remembers the cause, while the tears of her, whom he has ruined, and abandoned, are yet undried upon his cheek. And this too, when some lovely and innocent creature, the child of his old age, has been polluted upon the bosom of her father, and left, rifled, slandered, prostrate, distracted, to die, and rot, with the vilest of creatures—this! when he has torn some wife from her lord—some mother from her babes—broken the heart that doated on him—forgetting his own nuptial vow, and treading hers under his feet, or wasting himself in the embraces of a harlot—even then, righteous heaven! man is forgiven! Such is the award of society. And what is the consequence? Our youth learn to regard as trivial, what, in reality, is a most disgraceful and brutal crime. The penalty is nothing, for indulgence in sensuality, and, therefore, they consider the crime as nothing. Mistaken boys! Is it nothing to poison your own blood—nothing so to stupify and prostrate all your faculties, that the face of innocence and love is insupportable to you;— nothing so to debase and darken the immortal purity of your nature, that the dearest and tenderest of beings; woman, she who might be your solace and comfort, here and hereafter, is degraded, in the sacrilegious ministering of your passions, to a detestable, and humbling companionship? Nothing, to persevere in this till you have lost all reverence for her—dishonoured your mothers and sisters, by the ribald association of your thought, and learnt the tremendous creed of the libertine, that `every woman is at heart a rake.' Is this nothing? Where is your dream of happiness, in which woman is not a part? Of glory, where she does not sit, weaving the chaplet, or offering the crown? Of rapture, where her lips, and eyes, are not eternally moving before you? and where is there one noble, one exalted, or one worthy thought, of which woman, in her purity, and magnificence, in her nakedness and beauty, unvisited, unprofaned, is not the soul, and the idol, the vital impulse, the religion, and the meaning? Young man, think of this. It is no light matter to trample on the delicate flowers that spring up in pure hearts;—no light matter to dash down the beautiful imagery of our innocent youth, and shiver their splendours in the drunken wantonness of boyhood—to quench all the bright aspirations of divinity, that mount up from our hearts, when they are first touched with a live coal from the altar that God has erected to woman —But enough—I have wandered widely, dear Oxford, but I have felt what I have said; for, to my eyes, she was near me, with her look of speechless tenderness, rivetted upon the characters, as they were traced—it is her prompting that I have listened to, and it is her parting lips that have been before me all the while— It is not addressed to you,—it were an insult to mean it for a moment; but, after I had begun my own defence, I was carried away by my abhorrence of the very crime that I was defending. But then, how ends the argument? As well as I can understand it, thus— Women are wrong, or rather she is wrong, if she regard my transgression, as equal to the transgression of a woman; and I fear she will. Because, I think she will say, `what would he say, had I been guilty! As he 14* would say to me, I should say to him,—or, I shall sink in his respect.' This I am afraid of. She would rather die, I am sure, than be less reverenced, less loved than she is now, by me. The next in order, was a short letter, so very hurried, and broken, that Harold was barely able to decypher the following:— — O, what a trial! merciful powers! how my heart quakes at the recollection! I came near losing her— her words are ringing in my ears at this moment. O bless her! bless her! the sweet, broken, mournful tenderness—the tone and look and touch, of her dear cheek, as she murmured `I do forgive you.' O, my friend, I never shall forget it! I cannot, even yet. I cannot recal the circumstances of last night, without shuddering and weeping:— but, she forgave me. O, she has little else to fear from me. Her trials are now over. One more, only one more remains—and if she prevail again, I am hers forever and ever. Her constancy, her hopelessness, shall now be tried. If she fail, then—O, my Maker! let me die— But, if she withstand it, all— She refuses to write me; but the reason is a bad one. She has seen some unfortunate disclosures in the case of a dear friend, similarly situated. She fears that we may separate. This is bad policy. It puts us upon thinking of a separation. By risking nought, you do nothing to attach a heart to you: and the surest way of breaking off a love affair, depend upon it, is for each party to proceed as cautiously and discreetly as if each expected it. The sure way of making a man dishonest, I have found, is to show him that you think him so. Where people love, and love honourably, this is a cold and disheartening evidence of suspicion, that few generous spirits could brook. She ought to write me, but I shall not insist upon it, for her reasons are certainly good, and I shall leave all argument to the time when I am sick and absent, when her letters will be a consolation to me. Let her refuse to write me then, if she can!' To this succeeded the following, an illegible scrawl: `Something has happened. Whatever you hear, regard it not. Remember the past—my character—my life— believe nothing against me, until you hear from me, or see me. Farewell! Farewell.—Heaven, in its mercy, bless you! May 18—Midnight— Farewell, Oxford. I have done with the world! farewell. Before this reaches you, I shall be a dead man. Elvira and Oscar are asunder forever. She has broken my heart. The thunder has fallen, at last, and I think that I shall be in heaven or hell, before that clock strikes two—it is now three quarters after one. I am not determined—for myself I am, but I am afraid of her senses, if I should. This is all that deters me now, and this may not long. She is acting from a mistaken principle. I have done all that I could, but we never meet again. Oxford, farewell!—farewell!—farewell!—Do justice to my memory—farewell!' There were still many letters and billets and fragments of manuscript behind, which Harold carefully collected and laid aside for future perusal; but in tumbling them over, to find some connected detail, of the melancholy transaction, which, in its indistinctness was so thrilling, he fell upon a little note, literally glued to the fragment of another, written with a lead pencil, evidently in the extremest agitation, upon the leaf of some book, and soaked with blood—and marked at the edge with the print of bloody fingers. `She is dead!—dead—I have slain her—with these hands—Yes—say, that I slew her, I! with my own hands—I who so loved her! Oxford, farewell! farewell, forever! I am going mad. May be, I shall not kill myself. She was faithless. It were childish to die for her now. I slew her. I slew him. He is weltering at my side. I can put out my hand, and lay it upon his mouth. It is covered with blood, froth, clotted, and gasping. Do you see this print!—and this!—and this! —they are hot and smoking from his heart! would I could write, with the dagger's point. Almighty God! I drove it through and through him! Farewell—I go this moment. Hark! they are at the door. The fools— the baffled fools—if they had left me alone, another hour, I should have gone mad, and dashed out mine own brains, at their bidding. But now, I will escape, if it be only to show them their weakness. To-morrow I shall return. To-morrow I will give myself up to justice, and they shall see, and know, and feel, that it is I, and not they, who surrender Oscar! Once more, farewell! I do love thee, Oxford; I do indeed—but woe to thee, if I meet thee before my death. My appetite for life is a raging fire—it will not be quenched or allayed but in mine own blood, and that of them I most love now. Am I mad? I hope that I am—God will requite me cruelly else—yes, yes, I am mad—I see that, plainly. His blood here, it has made me so. My nostrils are full of it—pshaw, it is singularly offensive, is it not?— for the blood of an enemy. Canst thou read this? the characters smoke as I trace them. I tried a pen, but the ink was red and thick. I could not bear it. I then took this pencil—but lo! the characters are clotted—no matter—if we must have miracles—why, the more the —' The paper was torn here; and Harold, drowsy and yet unable to compose his agitated mind to sleep, threw himself back in the sopha, and fell to ruminating. A strange terrour, like a wintry chill, stole slowly over him; a something, as if a sea of cold water were rising, like a tide about him, higher and higher, as he shivered, to the region of his heart. The night—when would it end! That candle! it was lighted last by the murderer himself, perhaps, had been bedewed with some drop of the spirting blood—it now burned bluishly and fitfully; the lamp was glimmering at his side: the shadow of the furniture blackened, in wide and waving masses, over the floor and curtains. Harold let his hand fall from his forehead—it struck the handle of the dagger. He started, as if it had fallen upon a coiled serpent, and, as he did, whether it was the jar of his sudden motion, or what, he knew not, there awoke a deep, thrilling, and spontaneous vibration of the harp strings, followed by a loud crash, as if a heavy hand had that instant been taken from them. He turned aside with a feeling of horrour, that he was unable to suppress, holding the dagger in his hand—his eye rested on it— and, in the momentary delirium that followed, he strove, as he afterwards, said, to disengage his fingers from it, but he could not, for some moments!—at length, with a convulsive, desperate effort, he hurled it from him, and with such force, that it stood quivering in the wall —the light hastily flashed in the action of his arm—it struck, point first, as a murderer's knife always will, and glimmered, with a convulsive tremulous motion, in the moonlight. Could he be dreaming! was he mad too? He knew not—but, as he stood, overwhelmed with horrour and dismay, the figure of a man emerged from the solid wall, walked sternly and leisurely athwart the chamber, plucked the dagger out, and disappeared! just as Harold uttered a shriek, leaped forward, and fell senseless upon his face, as he put his hand upon the wall, probably to determine if his sight had not deceived him. The whole house was in an uproar; and the servants came thronging about the door, each afraid to enter, while the lights glimmered fitfully and dismally within, making innumerable fantastick shadows, and keeping them all in incessant motion, until the lovely Caroline entered in her night dress, her hair flying all loosely about her, and shrieking `my brother! my brother!'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Harold soon recovered his senses, but he was pale, and sick and speechless; nor was it until three days had passed, that he had received sufficient strength to speak calmly on the subject. Caroline, it seemed, had been awakened by the noise of the harp, and the shriek —and Harold could not bring himself to alarm her with the rest, until he was satisfied in his own mind. As soon as he was able, therefore, he went to the room, and examined the wall. The dagger was indeed gone, but there was the gash of its point in the wainscot, showing that it had been thrown by a strong hand. Desperate with ten thousand wild and fantastick apprehensions, and ashamed to betray the weakness that shook him, even to the eye of Caroline, he ordered his baggage to be removed to the room for a permanent residence. Night approached, and with it, a preternatural coldness. He arose and approached the harp, for the first time since that evening, and was struck by the apparent alteration in its appearance. The cause was soon visible—the chords were snapped—broken, every one of them. Could it have been by the touch of the spectre that he had seen? A force more than mortal was certainly required, and he remembered the deep sullen reverberation that startled him, when no human being was near the instrument, for he had hardly taken his eye off of it, in his abstraction, for a moment. In the feelings that followed—so awful and yet so active, that they were remembered with a singular mixture of pleasure—like danger from which we have miraculously escaped, Harold flew for relief to the remaining letters, that he had left in the desk—He opened it, but they were gone! but where? and by whom?— This was another inscrutable mystery; for he knew that no servant would have dared to enter the apartment, and his sister had accidentally mentioned but an hour before, that she had not the courage to come into it alone. Harold sat down upon the sopha; and as he did, his hand fell upon a bundle—he took it to the light, in the sudden hope that it was what he had lost, but it was not. It was well secured, and appeared to have been preserved with great care, for it was bound up in leather that was literally worn through, and chafed away at the corners, like a pocket-book that has been long used. He opened them, and was not a little surprised to find most of them in the hand writing of Elvira;—letters too, with the post mark upon them, and direction. It was inexplicable. Among them, three, in hand writings that were new to him, lay folded together. He opened them, and found them all directed to Oscar. The first was from Oxford himself, and by the date which was partially obliterated, he was able to discover that it was written about the same time as the last letter of Oscar to Oxford. `You are wrong, Oscar, in expecting that, from this moment I shall abandon you. That I do not intend to do. I shall not easily be compelled to do so. Could I be easily induced to abandon you, to disavow your acquaintance, and to stifle and smother in my heart all interest or concern for you, I should not have wanted an excuse for doing so. But while I say that I have not abandoned you, that I do not intend to abandon you, that I even wish to hold a place in your heart, in your affections and respect;— and that I would gladly reserve a place in my own for you, I do not, for I cannot say that I respect, as I have respected you. What then shall I say? To pour reproaches on your head, after you have confessed your abuse of the best feelings of those you loved best, would seem like determining to take vengeance on one who has thrown himself upon my mercy. Not to speak of your unworthy conduct, however, on the other hand, would seem like passing as venial, what cannot be excused, what cannot be palliated; what I can never forget—what I cannot yet say, and say truly, I forgive. Should I say what I think of your conduct, should I call the language which you have held to me in relation to Miss H. (if that is her name, for I do not pretend to know what her name is) by its right name, I fear I should give you occasion to suppose that I am in a violent passion, and that I am angry with you, rather than ashamed of your conduct. But you have degraded yourself in my estimation, more than, one month ago, I'would have thought it possible that you could degrade yourself. I have waited that, among other things (for I have had other reasons for my delay in not answering yours of the —) I might speak upon this subject temperately, and with all the kindness that my regard for you, or for the infirmities of our common nature would claim. But I fear that I have not yet waited long enough. I cannot suppress the conflicting emotions that agitated me when I first read that letter, and which rise whenever I think of the train of conduct which that letter discloses—or purports to disclose. Whether it is a real disclosure of your conduct, with Miss H. and your friends, or whether it is only a fictitious—a false slander of yourself, designed to prove to what depth you could make your friends believe you capable of sinking, while in fact you have not sunk at all—I confess, I know not. Are you trying their credulity in your confessions of guilt and shame, or were you trying it, in your reiterated protestations of innocence and disinterested charity. But stop—I cannot go on—whatever you may suffer from my delay in writing, I believe I suffer more in writing. You must wait then, a little longer. May — I should be glad to number Mr. — among my friends, and to look forward to passing some happy hours with him, in his charming family. I do hope that that is a pleasure still in reserve for me. I should, I am very free to confess, have looked forward to such an event with much livelier hope, and with a feeling partaking more of the character of a determination, were it not that one very interesting point in the fancy piece, that which YOUR figure would have occupied, is thrown into so deep a shade; had it not become so—not merely dark, but gloomy. I do not believe that what I said of you to him, lowered you in his estimation. It is true that, before I knew him here, your own hand had given the deadly stab to your own reputation. But when I saw him, I did not know that fact, and I spoke of you, rather as one, whose good feelings, whose chivalrous generosity had led him into imprudencies, imprudencies which age and experience would lead him afterwards to avoid—than as one who would deliberately deceive his best friends, that he might the more shamelessly insult them. But I find I am using language which you may not relish; and I'll stop. — — — — — — This is an unamiable letter, I know. I am aware that you may say `it shall never be answered.' (Here was a marginal note in pencil—`and if I had said so, he knew well, that it never would have been answered, while the breath was in my body,') still I hope you will not say so, I hope you will answer it. I have not forgotten all that you have done rightly, but misery was never in this world, more directly the consequences of sin, than your present sufferings are of your vices. This, however, I need not tell you—you must know it—you must feel it. This is the eternal order of things. Yours, Oxford. `What a letter!' cried Harold, as he finished. `I would go a pilgrimage to see the author of it. How stern and unforgiving at one moment, and how affectionate at another! It is the language of a brother.' The next that he took up was a vile, awkward scrawl, but the deportment was noble. Upon it, was this endorsement. `This is the only man who treated me as I deserved when I cast myself at his feet. Had not my temper been better than they thought it, their responses would have made me a devil. They were exactly calculated to drive me desperate. That I did not become so, was only owing to the kind influence of the woman that I loved, upon my naturally impatient and terrible disposition.' And this was the letter. `If my forgiveness for your fault, or my compassion for what you suffer as its punishment, can give you ease, be assured of both.' Vol. II. 15 But neither my pardon nor my sympathy is bestowed unconditionally. You have been guilty—deeply guilty, and you must abide the penalty. I ask for no more apologies, no more disclosures. My vengeance is satisfied, and as far as I am personally concerned, the atonement is commensurate with the injury. Indeed I have suffered no injury. I have been deceived; but the deception was almost momentary. All that I require, therefore, as a condition of pardon, is, that you henceforth (for your own especial benefit, not for mine) put yourself entirely under the direction and controul of your judgment and understanding, (the head was made for rule,) and if you ever find your heart stepping out of its place, interfering with the orders of its natural and lawful dictator, or murmuring against any of its wholesome restrictions, that you treat it as a common brawler and disturber of the peace, and a traitor and outlaw, to be hunted and pursued, and tortured with impunity, by any one who will think it of importance enough to pay him for the pursuit. You will find the performance of this condition hard at first, but time and practice will reconcile you to it; and if they should not, necessity, from whose law there is no appeal, will compel you to it, however repugnant to your wishes.” “I repeat that you have my full and perfect pardon. I have examined your motive and approve it. But unless you could roll back the wheels of nature, and recall the flight of time, you had no reason to expect any more favourable result than that which has happened. Your letter contains many things on which I could enlarge, if I had time.—But I trust that I have said enough to satisfy you that I am and ever shall be truly and sincerely your friend.— B—.” There was a strange, indefinable interest awakened in Harold's mind by these letters, and he hurried to the third, with a tremulous hand, in the hope of understanding more fully the event alluded to, which seemed so to have tried the love and respect of Oscar's friends.—The last was in his hand—an endorsement in pencil caught his eye—“Poor Caroline! I ought to have known thee better. Thou didst love thy brother, and he feels the hand of the Almighty upon his brow, like another Cain, for having broken thy heart. But—sleep on—dearest, thy brother will soon mingle his dust with thine, and then!—where is the angel that shall sift out the unrighteous for punishment!—Then, I shall be spared, Caroline, for thy sake—.” The letter ran thus— —“My brother,—I pity you, but blame you, not for divulging the secret, but for committing an act “base and dishonourable.” Had any one else dared to say that it were possible that you could be guilty of a “base” action, I should have contradicted the assertion in the strongest terms. I should have found it hard to forgive him, even for thinking it possible; and should have been eloquent in your defence—yes, eloquent, for I should have said that your life, so far as I knew, was a surety that it was impossible; and that I would stake my reputation upon your correctness of behaviour, morality, and purity of principle. Often and often have people said to me, your brother has a fine genius, great talents; you ought to feel proud of him, and I have answered—“I do—too proud, I fear, not of his talents—but of his principles. I did not think that you had no faults, or were not liable to the infirmities of human nature; O, no!—but I did believe, and have often uttered that belief in the strongest terms, that you would shrink with almost a female's sensitive delicacy from vice.—For this, I loved and honoured you, and forgave what else was amiss. But now I am humbled completely—yet, I forgive you. From me, no one shall ever know that you have erred, unless he infer it from my silence. Would that this letter (of May —) had not been written! I am ready to exclaim one moment; and the next, I take it and read it again. I would forget the contents, and awake, as from a dream—but it cannot be. The words “a base and forbidden” act are continually sounding in my ears. What could it be? You ought to have told the whole, or not to have named it. The truth may be a relief. There are a thousand conjectures what it may be—and it is possible we may have thought you guilty of that, which you would even now blush to commit.— “As for Elvira, she has done right. I honour her for her decision—she could do no less, but still, few would have had strength to do it, as she has. I sympathize with you sincerely—you know I do, if I say it—for I always feel more than I express. Had I written as my feelings at first dictated, you would have felt that you had done wrong. You have atoned—how?—by true repentance? or by a recompense. Oh! my still beloved brother, if you could but feel that you are an accountable being (although not in love, nor to any human creature)—to Him, who will convince you that man owes obligations to some one beside his fellow mortal, or himself, even Him, whom you so often thank, for not having made you like other men. “As for Elvira—you need not think that she will suffer from the affection that she still has:—no!—she will have much to support her, a consciousness of having acted rightly. Did she love the face, form, mind, or beauty of character, which ever it was—if it be impaired, her love will be diminished. She will deeply regret and keenly feel the disappointment, but will bless her heavenly Father that she knew it, ere too late. If you would spare her feelings—be silent: possibly, if your conduct should be for the future what it ought to be, she will feel that it is possible for you to be beloved after all. Do not sink beneath the blow; but endeavour to acknowledge the justice of your punishment. Do not, to revenge yourself upon her, punish yourself by marrying one unworthy of you.” To this was wafered the parts of two others letters— as follows—“Believe me, I can and do forgive thee, dear Oscar—and I say to thee, as our Saviour said to the woman—“go thy way, and sin no more: and I love thee too, with all thy faults. Thou hast often made good resolutions—but canst not keep them. They afford me but very little comfort—.” The margin of this was entirely written over—with these words—“This is cruel—she forgets my character. I never made a resolution in my life, that I did not keep, as few boys, and fewer men, ever kept theirs. No!—she has wronged me—and I cannot bear it from her—the world I could smile at, but that she, who has been a mother to me—that she should doubt my resolutions—it is hard—.” The next and and last was rumpled and blistered, probably with tears—and ran after this manner—“I have delayed answering your letter, that I might not write in anger. I forgive you, but I cannot forget immediately, that the brother of whom I had so often boasted, who would shield me from indelicacy, as from pestilence; who would not allow of my reading a book, that had the slightest impropriety in it, some years ago, would now, at this age, recommend as a friend, entitled to all tenderness, a woman that he personally knew to be any thing, but a proper companion for me. I feel so thankful to our heavenly Father, that we have escaped this degradation, that I will not reproach you for your intention, so happily frustrated. Had she visited here, and received the attention that we were willing to pay to a person so recommended, by a brother so beloved, I fear that you had bitterly repented your deceiving us. I know and feel, that I never could have had strength to bear the blow. Any misfortune—the loss of health, any thing but the loss of a good name, I could bear without repining. My heart has pleaded for you, to the last—when our suspicions were first aroused, I contended that you were deceived, or that you thought her amiable and good, when you first wrote us about her. Your letters have undeceived us—and taught us that perfection is not to be expected. Under this was written—“My sister!—farewell, forever.—Poor *15 girl!—her fears were prophetick”—“The sister of Oscar!”—said Harold, aloud—“then was she mine—“Dear Caroline—would I might know thy fate before I sleep:—I am impatient for morning.”—Saying this, he threw himself upon the couch, but the state of his mind prohibited all repose. He was fain to arise, and rifle the bundle of letters, which had hitherto lain untouched, at his side.—They were all in the hand writing of Elvira.—The first one that he opened—and the first upon the bundle, began thus—“I have seen him, dear Mary, and am exceedingly disappointed. I do not like him, and am convinced that I never shall. He is too imperious—and then, he scarcely bestows a look upon the rest of mankind. He is very loud and absolute in his tone—and appears to talk, just when he pleases, without any regard to the comfort of others. It is true that he talks remarkably well—remarkably—but I cannot endure his arrogance: and am really ashamed and angry, that I yielded so far as to see him, particularly after having excluded myself the whole evening from other visitors. —Still he is a very extraordinary man, and although I dislike him, and even tremble when he speaks to me, yet I cannot get him out of my head. I am continually comparing him with other men of his age; and have done this so frequently in my meditations, that I am really vexed with myself. Can he be amiable? The natural expression of his face appears mild—and that startling, strange, denouncing aspect, which it suddenly puts on, may, perhaps, be caused by certain mysterious events, of which I have heard some whispers—or perhaps may be, what he says is very common, a habit now, from mere indulgence in what was affectation. Did you ever observe the sudden change of his voice— now so clear, that your blood thrills at the sound, as at a near clarionette; and now so deep and awful, that it takes your breath away—and you require some moments to recover from its effect; there is an inconceivable solemnity in his manner at times—and yet such sudden transitions—flashes almost of levity, that I am really perplexed to determine, whether he is the most changeable of human beings, and the strangest—or only a consummate actor. You have remarked the thoughtfulness of his brow—the intolerable brightness of his eyes. But why need I rail about him to you;—I shall never shake your enthusiasm in his behalf—so farewell for to night. Can he be amiable, I ask again; I believe not. I dread to have him for an acquaintance. He seemed strangely indifferent to what agitates the rest of the world—and so cold and careless in his courtesy, that I should almost call him ill bred, were it not evidently the effect of his haughty temper. He cannot conceal his scorn and contempt for trivial things. His forehead, particularly when he is listening intensely, betokens a spirit, that a woman ought to dread. His manner is not more abrupt and searching, than his tone and glance. These things, and a look of fierceness at times, with a sort of intrepid self-confidence, are all that I find remarkable in him. Neither his person nor countenance, is striking at first sight. But his voice disturbs me yet—I can hear it at midnight, when I am all alone. I have heard many voices that I liked better, in the trifling chit-chat of the day, and seen many persons who were more fluent and musical in their utterance—but never did I hear tones, that so thrilled through and through me—nor witness such deep solemnity of manner, or such impassioned, such unspeakable vehemence of language,—such fine adaptedness of energy and phrase, and tone, and look, and action, as I have seen in him, even during our short acquaintance. For one moment, his countenance was appalling. Our attention was rivetted, in spite of ourselves—there was a mortal silence in the room, of which not a soul was sensible, until he had done speaking. But he was accustomed to such things—he showed no emotion; and looked as if he would have been more astonished, if we had not been silent. He must be conscious of his powers —his looks show it. Is he not sarcastick—bitter? Do you not think too, in spite of his disregard for fashion and ceremony, that a part of his contempt is affected, and that the singular air of high fashion and dignity, that is acknowledged to characterise him, is the consequence of some other feeling than contempt, or hatred of the graces and gracefulness of life. I suspect that he is vindictive; something escaped him, whether by accident or not, I do not pretend to say, because, much as he appears the creature of prompt feeling, I do not believe that we see or hear aught of his first impulses,—yet he turned deadly pale, his lip quivered, and his dark eyes flashed fire, as some one spoke of another who, it seems, had wronged him.—Another remark I have made, which of course, you, as one of his admirers, will only laugh at—I do not believe that these sudden explosions of eloquence, are unpremeditated. No!—his emphasis, my dear Mary, appears too resolute—too strongly and critically placed—and he is too ready with the best language on all occasions, for me to believe that they are the irregular, and spontaneous eruptions of the heart. Is he not a great lover of paradox? That you will not deny. And it is a notion of mine, that we witness very few scintillations of his brain, that are immediate, and unthought of before. It appears to me that he does nothing, and says nothing, even when most unguarded, without an especial design. I may do him injustice; but such is my present opinion, for I have observed his eyes, and they have always appeared, as if searching the very inward thought of some person present, however carelessly he might be looking. This is disingenuous in him—but I cannot help the opinion. I hope that do not wrong him; but these all appear to me as so many indicia of his character, thrown out, by way of feeling his company. I wish Helen and Olivia were here—we should soon be able to fathom his character. Does he sing? They say no. He has certainly a natural and vigorous judgment of musick—and denounces fearlessly the fopperies of the Italian and French school. Who are your masters? he says, French valets and barbers—and Italian lazaroni—or worse, shattered and tarnished nobility. They are purely national. Of course, they cannot, and do not tolerate the sweet, simple, touching and beautiful melody of Scotland and Ireland. No!—they execrate it. And you—most unnaturally join in the execration. Be assured that it is weak—very weak to do so. Our musick, like our dress and manners, is national; and it would be as absurd for us to adopt the Italian and French musick, with their affected, artificial fineries and fopperies, to the exclusion of our own simple musick, as it would be to abandon our fashion of dress, and adopt theirs.” These are almost his very words. You see how direct and unshrinking he is. But I like him the better for that. It has an air of downright reality, and manhood, that is not common here. I am very anxious to hear him read—if his voice and manner be what you say they are, then we must endeavour to make him sing. But no—we shall not succeed—one of his last remarks, I recollect, was on this subject—and you will smile when you know to whom it was addressed, and when—Mr. —had just finished his admirable song, your favourite —Salisbury looked him in the face—and told him, in a deliberate voice, that it was a reproach to him to sing so well. The poor man blushed, and yet his eyes sparkled with pleasure. It was no light matter to receive such a compliment from this strange creature. “Are you not ashamed,” said Philip to Alexander, who had been playing divinely on a flute, at the table “are you not ashamed to play so well.”—he added, addressing himself to me, in an under voice. Thursday. Oscar Salisbury is a creature of contradiction. I know not what to make of him. To day he utters a sentiment that makes me doubt, either his principle, or his good opinion of me: and to-morrow I find him acting like a hero. The last time I saw him—(by the way he is very attentive to Harriot, and even kind of late—poor girl, she has need of it—and is welcome to it) he reprobated the principle of gratitude. I looked at him with surprise. “Why cultivate the sentiment,” said he—“is it not a burden? Does not this prove it? The generous and noble minded are ever struggling to throw it off. If the feeling of gratitude be so agreeable, why attempt to discharge the debt? No—it is not—and we are impatient to get rid of the load of obligation.”—How strangely plausible and brief!—There appears to me to be some confusion in the terms used; but I have no patience to reason, where such a virtue is deliberately outraged. So much for the sentiment. Now the action that I alluded to, is this—I am pretty well assured that he has been visited, at his own lodgings, by a poor, unfortunate girl—who is extremely beautiful, and distractedly in love with him— that he spared her—and that she has since declared the fact upon her death bed—what godlike forbearance! The history is very touching, and when I have told you all, you will find your favourite, beside all that you have known of his virtues—“did good by stealth and blushed to find it fame,” many times, when even you knew it not. By the way, a wicked experiment was tried upon his honesty and self command, the other evening, by Harriot. We had heard that he was once terribly in love with a woman whom we knew.—Harriot introduced her name, when all eyes were upon him. His countenance never changed—but a slight, tremulous motion of the lip, and a sadder tone, when he spoke, betrayed the truth to me. He spoke of her, precisely as if he had no thought worth concealing from us. He acknowledged that he had loved her—and he never stood so high in my estimation, as when he concluded with a rapid summary of her virtues —and faults—and added in an agitated voice—“I am afraid that she is unhappy now.” Indeed he had good reason to think so; for we know her history, and if ever there was a broken hearted woman on earth, she is one— if the world tell truly. Sunday. I have seen him repeatedly since my last—and like him rather better. He takes more pains to please us— and we are, therefore, I suppose, more pleased. Several of our old beaux have taken the alarm—they come less frequently now—and are unspeakably silent, while he is here; nay, two of them appear to have forsaken us entirely, and one, I think, in consequence of a rebuke from Oscar (for so we call him now). Helen has been here, and we succeeded in making him read a tragedy to us. Nor was it any very difficult matter, for though he coloured at first, and his voice was mightily agitated when we first heard him, yet it did not seem so much from doubt, or diffidence, as from some secret emotion. Does he pride himself on reading? I believe that he does. It is certain, that his tones are the most touching, powerful, and rich that I ever heard, in passionate composition. Helen affects to laugh at me. She says that he reads to her without any embarrassment: but that his perturbation is excessive, when I am listening to him. I have observed this too—but I do not attribute it to the same cause that she does. Never did I hear such delicate, melancholy, and deep modulation of tone— I should half suspect that he was the author of every thing that he has read to us, by the interest that he contrives to give it, did I not know better. When he concluded, we were all in tears!—But hush—I find that I can talk of nothing else but Salisbury's voice—So adieu. Monday. What inexhaustible stores of information!—Did you ever hear him open his lips, even to profess his ignorance of a subject, without imparting some charm to it? We have been discussing the comparative morality of Christians, Turks, and Jews. He overwhelmed us all, not as he used to, with magnificent declamation, but with temperate argument, facts, and the most beautiful language. He says the Jews are the most wonderfully constant people that walk the earth; that their religion is the most sublime and awful. What it was with Moses, it is now, he says. The same ritual—the same ceremony, alike august and imposing. We witness, what they of Israel did. Ages—have passed away—centuries after centuries, and this people, strangers all over the earth, accursed and scorned alike, by the black man and the white, the Christian, the Infidel, the Mahometan and the Turk—prohibited from all the offices of humanity and policy—exceptions to all the rules of forbearance and indulgence among men—blasphemed and trampled on, by all nations and kindreds and tongues—are yet so constant to their God—that their very faces bear witness to their fidelity and their origin:—so heroically and devoutly obedient to their Jehovah, that their very blood and features are a part of their religion—and their countenances are the very countenances of them that heard the thunderings and the lightnings of Sinai, when the Everlasting God touched it, and it smoked. Where is there such another people?” he asked triumphantly. And who could answer him? To this, succeeded a picture of the Turks—“Their religion, right or wrong,” he says, “is a religion. A Turk believes in predestination—hence his sincerity is proved every hour in the day; for he plucks off the festering garments from a body dissolving with the plague, and puts them upon himself: he rushes into battle, up to the very cannon's mouth, or to a certain martyrdom, because it is his religion. Do the Christians this? no. The Turks too, when at their devotions, which are, at the least, ten times as frequent as ours, are never to be disturbed. You may ride over them before they will rise, unless they have finished their appointed prayer. We call their prophet an impostor—they call our Christ a prophet. Who of us shows most of courtesy. Compare our honesty with theirs. They leave their shops, full of precious merchandize, open and unguarded, and they are never rifled—they give untold gold into the hands of strangers, and are never deceived. Can we say this of Christians?”—Such is his manner—nay, I believe, almost his very words again; for it appears to me that I cannot forget what I have once heard him say, if it be said in that one peculiar voice, which is altogether his own. Forgive me. Do not rally me—I cannot bear it now. Your reproaches are insupportable, for I feel that I deserve them. Your prediction is accomplished!—Salisbury —O, would that I had never seen him! All my friends complain of me. And yet, nay, it does not appear to me that I am so devoted to him as they say. No—no—it is a cruel slander. I am melancholy Mary—I cannot write you a long letter—or an intelligible one. He has said that he once loved—and when he said so, his eyes convinced me, that he loved yet. When I first saw him, I had a notion, whence I do not know, that he was engaged—I wish that you could have seen him at the time—the recollection haunts me—his downcast eyes —the deep, mournful tenderness of his tone—O, yes, he, he must have loved indeed!—She is now married, and there is a story abroad—O, I cannot believe it—I hope it is not true—yet why does it concern me? I would always respect Salisbury—nay, whether this story be true or false, I must always respect him. He is so noble, frank, and generous! I know not what to think of him even yet. His talents are certainly of the highest order—of that, I see the most unquestionable evidence, in the respect manifested to him, by men of the greatest reputation, and greatest wisdom—he sits among them like their equal, and they listen to him, as to one entitled to commune with them —but he appears to be unsocial—abstracted—and too fearfully ambitious for domestick happiness—bless me,— where are my thoughts running to!—He has the reputation of being vain—nay, he acknowledges that he is so —but I am afraid, not because he thinks so, but merely to manifest his disregard for the world. He has been hardly used, they say—unkindly, cruelly—but he never complains, and some appear to shudder, when they speak of his hostility and retribution; but I do not—I think that his mortal enemy, in his power, would have little to fear. He is still proud, very proud, and unbending to strangers,—to all, indeed, except the poor and bereaved; but his manner is tender, less abrupt, and more agreeable of late, I think. Have you ever remarked how sudden and Vol. II. 16 bold he is, in his advice;—and with what an air of authority, he often speaks his opinion, even to the aged. It is wrong, I think—but I am led to believe that it proceeds from an habitual experience of the world's harsh judgment, and uncharitable ways. He stands like a gladiator—expecting to encounter none but foes— sword and shield.—One trait is decidedly prominent in his character. He never flatters, or if he do, he never appears to flatter. You cannot but believe what he says, even though it be new to you; for he gives a reason—and there is always such an air of manhood and sincerity about him, that you are convinced, whether you will or no—it would almost seem, but good night!—good night!—I could run on forever, but I forbear.— Tuesday night. People say here, and those too, that know him well —that is, his whole life and history—that he will be a great man. But great men, are not so easily made, for he talks as calmly of ten or twenty years application, night and day, as many would of ten or twenty months, —and yet he denies that there are any great men to be seen, in this generation. His friends are very confident that he will be distinguished, but they tremble for him. You never saw such devoted creatures as they are. Their attachment is invincible, and not only that, but it seems more like the friendship that we read of, sublime, heroick, and steady, than like what we usually experience. His enemies too, are as unsparing and deadly, we are told, as his friends are enthusiastick and firm. But they are sensibly diminishing. We hear him spoken in high terms of now, by some who have been his enemies— they acknowledge that they have misunderstood his character, and wronged him. You would smile however, to hear him justify them. He says that those who know him, are his friends—But that his enemies, having no opportunity of knowing, are obliged to judge of him, as he appears,—haughty, overbearing, and repulsive, or vindictive; they are right, therefore, he says, in disliking him. His enemies used to lie against him once, and censure him often, without knowing why. And now, he says, and shows us the proof in some amusing revolutions of opinion, that he is praised in the same way, by those who do not, and cannot know him. Some too, lie in his favour now; but he does not hesitate to expose them, for it. In short, it is the publick opinion that has changed—and, he predicts that it will continue to change, making him alternately better, and worse than he is, for many years. He is prepared for this; and so far as I can judge, I should think him one whom this change of opinion would affect, be it better or worse, less than any other human being that I ever saw. He says that it is impossible to flatter a man of sense; or rather that a man cannot long entertain too high an opinion of himself; and I believe this. But he says also, that the world can be deceived, and are deceived constantly, respecting a man's talents: for they, he says, are like wealth. When is a man's property rightly valued by the world? never. By himself it may be; and intellectual affluence is like all other affluence, best known to the possessor. You might as well expect a man to believe you, if you told him that he had more money in his pocket—as that he had more brains in his head, than he actually had. There may be exceptions; but this, he advances, as a general proposition. Mary dear—tell me—is my style altered; I am told that it is—nay, that I have caught a portion of his spirit, and actually use, after him, not only his sentiments, but his very language, at times. If I do—I am unconscious of it: sorry for it, and would avoid it. Nay — for why need I conceal it—they do tell me, for it is a fact that I resemble him in my countenance, as I believe myself, although I hope not, in the expression—and we have been repeatedly taken for relations—and once for brother and sister—they do tell me, that I have contracted one of his worst habits—one that I would, if I might dare to attempt it, break him of—that of knitting the brows, and frowning, as if discontented. In him, it is probably earnestness or abstraction, but it looks like ill temper. Oh—another thing has just occurred to me— There is a bitter levity in his manner sometimes, that terrifies me. It is a strong word, Mary, but it expresses no more than I feel. He sneers sometimes at love, and marriage, in a way that leaves me in doubt whether he does not regard them as a mockery. I do not like this —it distresses me, because it makes me question his principle—or at least, when he says, with a look that is common to him, a severe thing on this subject, I am led to doubt his sincerity or his principle. Some one mentioned the marriage of Mr.—the other evening. “Poor fellow!” said Salisbury—“I knew him—he was a very worthy fellow!”—just in tone and look exactly, as if it were his death. There was no smile upon his face —when he said this—and his voice was deep and lingering. What think you dear, of these symptoms? or have you never heard and seen him, at such a moment? The general impression I find is, that he speaks as he feels, scorning all the tenderness and simplicity of life, as childish, affected, and mawkish. But I—perhaps I am deceived—I think that his heart is the abiding place of the deepest tenderness—and that its emotion is like that of deep water—at the bottom—not to be detected by the agitation of the surface. Really!—I believe that is one of his own thoughts. Adieu!— * * * It is time to go to bed, but I will venture to scribble a postscript. I open it for that purpose. He has just left us. How very abrupt he is! He always starts off, as if suddenly offended. But he says it is because he dares not trust himself to think of it—and had rather plunge, at once, than stand shivering, forever, upon the brink. He takes out his watch too:—if we reproach him, he says that it is the greatest compliment to us—for it shows that he dare not trust to his senses, in our company. He was uncommonly serious to night—and really dignified. We had a literary man, whom you shall know, when you come on,—of a singularly unpretending, simple and strange character. A conversation ensued between Oscar and him; and I felt him—Oscar, rise every moment in my estimation. He was calm, collected, and graceful. His language was that of consummate self possession—I never respected him so sincerely. Others seem to stand in awe of him: and they wonder that I do not. But I do not—I cannot—to me, he is gentle—Do not laugh at me, Mary. I cannot well bear it, of late— whether it be, that I feel conscious of deserving it, or not, I wo'nt pretend to say, but my spirits are darkened, and any allusion that would once have been taken kindly, is apt now to hurt and alarm me. But no more of this —I know your tenderness, and delicacy—and am willing to tell you all my thoughts. What a postscript!— And I am not half done.—I remember one of his opinions, which Mr.—seemed particularly struck with, and acknowledged, honestly, that it explained a circumstance perfectly to his satisfaction, upon which, he had frequently meditated before, without being able to account for it. And yet it seems very simple.—Is not that the character of a great mind, though, to make its demonstrations so clear, that we are led to wonder at their simplicity? We were speaking of poetry and elocution; Mr.—reiterated the opinion that the Greek and Roman school had furnished the greatest that had ever been —or would ever be. My opinion upon that subject, said Oscar, modestly (I give you nearly his very words —) are somewhat peculiar. Is it not a matter of taste, and opinion? now it is my taste, and my opinion that there have been many as great musicians, orators, statesmen, warriours, painters and poets—nay—even of sculptors—and architects—among the nations of modern time, as among the ancients. Of warriours and statesmen, said his antagonist, there may have been, but surely not of poets and orators. And would you teach, then, said Oscar, that poetry and eloquence are arts so rude and simple, that they are brought to perfection, in less time than politicks and war? They are not sciences, said Mr. A. triumphantly, I *16 thought—and the testimony of all nations is to this effect—that poetry and eloquence are the natural growth of a semi-barbarous people—thus Ossian—and Homer.— Oscar turned his eye slowly upon him, and replied with such effect—but no!—I will not attempt to describe it—you ought to have seen him.—“Sir, said he, have you ever examined that opinion? May it not have been too hastily taken up? In the first accounts that we hear of the East, we find that the people were abundantly more refined than their neighbours. And yet—where is there any poetry, like that of the eastern people—the Orientals—at that time too, so fervid—bold and impassioned? Among savages, I admit, that there is a kind of poetry, as there is a kind of eloquence, and a kind of architecture. But why should poetry be rude, and boisterous, any more than musick? I cannot understand it, and my belief is, that poetry and eloquence, like all other intellectual arts, are to be perfected by the gradual perfection of society. And therefore if it can be shown that musick, painting, architecture, and sculpture (of the last, it is true, there may be a question) have improved, or could be improved, beyond what they were, with the Greek and Roman, I will undertake to show that poetry and eloquence may be so too.” “But, you have all the nations of the earth against you, said Mr. A. Do they not all concur in preferring Homer and Virgil, to all other poets?” “True—but Virgil was the growth of the Augustan age; and Cicero, and Demosthenes were no barbarians, and that would seem to affect your doctrine, that poetry is best in its rudeness. They prefer the statuary and architecture of the Greeks and Romans. But do you—honestly now—I know that you have seen the Apollo and Venus,—do you believe that they may not be surpassed? You hesitate. Have you never seen a sculptured woman, done by some modern, (and you know that sculpture is neglected more than any other art) that pleased you better than the Venus? I have, nay more, I can point out material disproportions in her form. But may not this be the case—nay, is it not—that we prefer the models of Greek and Rome, in all arts and sciences, (and by we, I mean all the moderns) for the same reason that an Englishman next to them, prefers those of his own country, and a Frenchman those of his?— “I do not understand you—” said Mr. A.— “I mean my dear sir, to lead your attention, indirectly, to my object. An Englishman is prejudiced in favour of the labours of his own countrymen—the larger the empire of his country, the wider that prejudice will be distributed; now, if you could extend the dominion of Great Britain over all the world, do you not believe that, in time, the whole world would be likely to refer only to British models, as the only standard of excellence, just as they would to London, for fashion and pronunciation? Now, suppose that no other nation had any literature—or science—would it not be the natural consequence, after a while, that what ever was done at London, would be consecrated, imitated and applauded, all over the world? Here then is my conclusion.—Greece was as an universal monarchy, because, as to the nations of the earth, she was the capital, and metropolis of taste. Then come the Romans. Their empire was universal. They, reverenced, and imitated the Greeks. No other nation did, or could dispute with them. And in time, whatever was written at Rome, or applauded at Rome, or built, or done at Rome, or hallowed by Roman approbation, came to be applauded, and imitated all over the world, wherever the Romans were known or heard of. The nations of the earth unite, in preferring Homer and Virgil, because of this universal dominion, to which they were once subject. And if Italy should reconquer the whole world, her poets would be the standard: if England,—hers; if France,—hers. And the reason why no poet, or orator, or painter of modern time is regarded, generally, as equal to the ancients, is because, in no modern time, has there been so extensive or so permanent an empire as the Roman in exstence; but you have always found that, as a kingdom extended itself, her authorities and opinions, her favourites, in poetry and eloquence, extended their dominion with it. Every nation in Europe may have, at this moment, a greater than Demosthenes, or than Homer, but until that nation extend her dominion, far and wide, like the Roman, they will not be universally esteemed so. Within their own limits they are often regarded as superior to all others, and, as their limits extend, that opinion extends.” “But,” said I; “why do they not, if your argument be just, why do not the people of each nation, prefer their own orators and poets to those, even of Greece and Rome?” “Some of the wiser, or more daring, do so:—said he, but the true reason why it is not universal, is this. Go into a small town, and you will find that it has its great man—whom it prefers to all other great men, except some one, in preferring whom, all the country concurs. But where is he? at the capital of the whole country. When Rome was at its zenith, she was the capital of all the world—all the nations of Europe were then, but as provinces. No competition, of course, could arise between her great men, and theirs. But stop—I can make this plainer—and therefore I will not finish what I had intended to—suppose Great Britain should suddenly eclipse all other nations—and establish at the same time an universal monarchy— suppose that hundreds of years afterwards every one of her provinces should become a kingdom, in all the schools of which the ancient statues, coins, paintings, dramas, and architecture &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. of Great Britain were regarded as models, and examples;—now, cannot you suppose, that although, in each of these kingdoms, all these arts should be brought to greater perfection than their models, yet nevertheless, that they would not unite in acknowledging it. Would not jealousy, prejudice, and infatuation prevent it? And would not the natural consequence always be, that, in each kingdom, the old British model would be preferred, because all had preferred it, while its own modern imitations, would be considered the next best? Is not this exactly the case at present, with respect to Rome! And is it, therefore, a conclusive proof of the superiority of the Greeks and Romans, that all the natives of the earth agree in acknowledging it.—I say no.” Upon my word!—I have made a pretty postscript indeed!—another whole sheet. But I will stop now —with this one remark,—I have not done him justice. He was perfectly clear, I have not remembered it so well as I thought that I could.— After my last long, long epistle, which I hope you have decyphered by this time, I was determined to indulge you with a respite.—still the same theme though —I can neither talk, write, nor think of any thing else.—There appears to me nothing conciliatory about him. He takes favour as a matter of right; and is strangely scrupulous in his speech. It seems to distress him, to hear a word mis-pronounced; or a phrase badly constructed. Yet he sometimes errs—in pronunciation I mean, very rarely in a grammatical sense. And how he renders his thanks!—his countenance never changes, except to me. He is the favourite of the whole household too: down to the very servants and children; and yet, there is no soothing, nor coaxing in his manner. And here another of his remarks occurs to me—Show him a man in a passion, he says, and he can always tell what he has been. Early habits are omnipotent. Thus, men swear and talk vulgarly when in a rage; and they who never write provincially, often speak so. Is'nt there much truth in this? I have applied it frequently since; and not long ago saw a very great man wipe his nose on his cuff, very naturally—when he had lost his artificial character, in the heat of debate. How necessary is self possession, before such an observer! This morning, a friend of our uncle's came in—and gave us a good deal of information, indirectly, respecting Oscar. You know him—Mr. Ponsonby—a very strong mind, and acquainted with men too, you know. He says that Oscar Salisbury, is the most extraordinary man of his age, that he ever met with; “I never sat with him, ten minutes in my life,” said he, “without hearing some remark, that proved him to be no common man. The first time that we ever met, I remember well that he maintained, against a whole room full, and successfully too, for I have thought much of it, since, and all my observation confirms his doctrine, that the difference of genius in men was only a difference in irritability! He, who is born with the most sensibility, the most delicate nerves, is most liable to be affected by all outward or inward circumstances. Women, and infants are an example. He who is most affected in this way, (I can remember Mr. Ponsonby's language better than Oscar's I find!)—is least able to confine his attention to one object; what he feels, he feels keenly, exquisitely, thrillingly, but he never explores, never ransacks,—never meddles with the alchymy of nature. Hence he becomes a wit, a poet, a musician, a painter, an orator, a statesman or a mathematician, as he has more or less physical sensibility! How little sensibility, thought I to myself, must Locke and Newton have had!—and is it not true? If they had much, would they ever have pursued their terrible metaphysicks, as they did? No—never! The more sensibility he has—the more irritable he is—and the more irritable he is—the less patient he is—and the less patient, the less likely to be profound.—What immeasurable letters I write of late. Once, I said that a letter ought to be brief, but Oscar says—(the deuse take the man!—his name is eternally at the tip of my pen, I believe)—but he says that we ought to talk as we write—and that it would be just as absurd to think it a merit to say, what we have to say, in the fewest possible words, on paper—as in conversation: that the beauty of both, is the free, natural, and unlaboured expression of our thought, without affecting terseness or any thing else. As well might we talk in epigram, like the laconic Spartans.—A dieu.— Gracious heaven! Maria—dearest—it is settled! I cannot tell you when, or how—I am so happy; but he has acted with the utmost gentleness and delicacy. I should have written you immediately—but my temples have been throbbing, nay, my very finger ends, for a whole week:—and it is only to-day that I can guide the pen at all.—He has many faults—some that I did not know of, till he confessed them—great faults—but he is so candid, so resolute, and has already done so much in the way of reformation, that I have no fear either for him, or for myself, were they much more numerous and threatening! Good night!—good night! My hand is steadier to day; so I have re-opened your letter, and begun again. I had a terrible dream last night—you will laugh when you know what it is, but really it distressed me exceedingly—and I was half afraid to meet him this evening again, lest I should find it confirmed. I was troubled, but he was too sharpsighted not to discover it—although I did my best to conceal it. At length, like a fool, I told him—never shall I forget his look!—“I am utterly in your power— —use it mercifully—kindly—do not destroy me— utterly” he said—“and I had once determined never to put myself in the power of any other woman” —the tears rose in my eyes—and his hand shook. But no tear was in his—he never weeps—he cannot weep, I believe. I dreamt that he was holding my hand—that his brow suddenly darkened, and he threw it from him. Where was my spirit? gone—I sat as if my heart were broke.—Nay, worse, Maria—when I awake, I felt as if I should sit so in reality, if he were so to wrong me. O—how I am altered, I was unhappy, till I saw him—and never, never did I part with him so reluctantly. O—if he be to grow to my heart yet more closely, as I fear he will—fear, oh no! —as I hope he will, I declare Mary, I do believe that it would kill me to part with him. How I love him!—yes the word is written, and I wont recall it. I never could have spoken it—he appears to me too, to want my love—who knows but that I may minister to his greatness, till he may say that, but for me, he had been less great! I have a strange foreboding too, that he will want my love still more—nay, that it will yet be his only consolation in this earth. Can it be! —I would almost wish, that it might be so!—that he might be abandoned by all the world, for a time, to feel how entirely I would give myself up to him. Poor Oscar!—with his spirit—so injured—as it has been—so haughty, and so unpropitiating, he is the very man to experience the ingratitude of them that ought to love and reverence him.—Farewell—I cannot write another line—my tears blot the paper.— A vile thought has just intruded upon me. Assist me to subdue it. I am afraid that Oscar is a little jealous—no, not that exactly—but there is a spice of haughty jealousy in his disposition. I dread the consequences. If I know him, he would show his jealousy, unlike any other man:—it would be, by giving every opportunity that he could, to his rival, worthy or unworthy. If worthy, I am sure that he would, because he has told me that he does not consider me bound to him, for one moment longer than while I prefer him to all the world. Nay—he will not take an engagement—for he says that it is folly. Either it binds when affection will not—or it does not. If it do—away with it—who would let a woman marry him, because she was engaged? If it do not—then it is useless. He is something that unsteadies the mind while it contemplates him. How he derides, and scorns, all the ridiculous ceremonies of life! They are tricks, he says, that patrician fools invent, like escutcheons, to distinguish their party. And when these are counterfeited by the plebians, or imitated, they manufacture others, like the Free Masons. He maintains that our civilities should always be proportioned to our own estimate of people's value, not to that of the world, when we meet a person: that, by treating all alike, our greatest favours lose all value. Is it not so? Is not distinction what we covet? and may not a friend be as much distinguished by a smile, as by an embrace? assuredly yes. What amazing candour he has! I believe that I am now mistress of every event of his past life—or every one that he thinks of.—His heart lies naked before me. There is much, particularly one transaction—relating to that strange woman, of whom I wrote you, which I could wish had never happened; but no matter—what is past must be forgotten. O, Mary, how I have suffered respecting her!—for a long while she haunted me. I would dream of them—see them together—she would break in between us—and he would abandon me! I declare that I was afraid to shut my eyes at last. Her very name hung, like a dead weight, upon my heart—his emotion—their intimacy, which he acknowledges—her passionate love for him, of which I have the proof—the peril that he underwent, for her—and I know not what—the thought of it made me sick. Yes Mary,—can you believe it?—at one time I had no wish to live; even yet, he cannot entirely assure me, and he half complains of me, that I will not be comforted; but I know not how it is—I have a superstitious thrilling when I think of her: as if she were one day to be a curse to me—a sickening apprehension that she is yet—Yet—merciful Father —yet!—beloved by Oscar! what he did, was right, he says, because there was nobody to care for him, and nobody to suffer, by any misrepresentation of the intimacy. It was long before he knew me, you know, I suppose. But he says that he would do the same thing again, under the same circumstances. But then, he adds, in his own soothing, affectionate way, “you know Elvira, that the same circumstances never could occur again.” Perhaps this is jealousy in me. Oh, I hope not. I would give up my life to see him happy; but I cannot bear to think, for a moment, that he loves her, or that— dear Mary, I cannot write it— Vol. II.—17 One thing, at least, is certain, although my friends are very anxious about her, that Oscar will never permit himself to marry, unless his heart is entirely free—and then, I am sure, this phantom will pursue me no longer. His godlike principles will be my protection—whatever may happen. Good night!— Monday Night. He is too much addicted to argument. He makes me unhappy by it. How dreadful it is, to hear two persons wrangling fiercely, and continually, while all the rest are constrained to be silent. Let me give you another specimen of his contradiction. Mr. O— was censured for changing his religion again. It was called a mark of weakness—and fickleness. “It may be,” said Oscar,— “but the weak are obstinate—so are the ignorant—the wise change their opinions often; so do the active and inquiring; but the obstinate and ignorant never do.” Such is his way! Have you ever heard him speak upon a theme that was rousing and proportioned to his full powers? He dwelt upon Shakspeare lately—His countenance was pale, deadly pale, when he began—(indeed people say that he is in a consumption—but he ridicules the thought; I attribute it to other causes, and entreat him to be more prudent—and go to bed, like our watchmen, betimes— and you know that they are distinguished for their orderly habits—) but it was crimson before he concluded, with the excess of inspiration. I had been listening, for a long time, to a very common-place eulogy upon the bard, when I saw Oscar's lip was trembling—I could not forbear—I thought that I had more command of myself—but so it was—I touched the train, and never did I see a poor creature so astonished as Doctor Wilson was, (for it was he, and you know his pompous way; besides I knew that he disliked Oscar exceedingly, and had spoken quite disrespectfully of him.) “Shakspeare!” said Oscar, “who can measure his might? He is a magician—and when he puts out his hands—the clouds roll away from the heavens—the waters tumble into foam— and there comes upward, a subterranean musick, as if the pillars of the earth were organ pipes, and a great wind were among them!—” Now it was impossible even for me to tell if he were serious—but he continued, and I soon found that he was so, even to solemnity, unutterable solemnity. “Shakespeare is a magician; I admit that. But his time has past. What gives his licentiousness, his absurdity, his obscenity, and horrible caricaturing, effect?—What, that ribald, brutal lasciviousness, which characterises all his portraitures of that most beautiful and wild passion, love—(except in Miranda—) what! but this—that ever since it was the fashion to idolize Shakespeare, men of the greatest talents have been spending whole lives, in giving effect and significancy to all that he uttered—studying his words, and dwelling upon them, and seeking their hidden and mysterious meaning, and, still oftener, imagining what he never thought of, as a sure means of making themselves conspicuous. Take the vilest tragedy that was ever written —let Garrick—Kemble—Cooke, and such men, spend their whole lives, in giving to every word and phrase significancy and effect, and, in time, it would be considered preternatural. There lies the secret. A plain man, who has never seen one of Shakespeare's tragedies performed, laughs at our enthusiasm. He considers the whole as a broad caricature of every passion—a caricature done by a master—by one, at whose touch the solidest and coldest and darkest material, became illuminated and transparent, and shot forth flames; but nevertheless, so exaggerated, (for the mob if you please,) that it is a caricature. Take his Moor and Desdemona. Who, of any feeling, does not loathe the horrible depravity of Desdemona?—it is brutal lasciviousness!—What think we?—the idea of our planters cohabiting with a yellow woman is shocking to us—almost unnatural—but with a black! we should abhor and detest him. But this is yet worse—a woman, altogether lovely, queenlike, and gentle, loves to death and distraction—whom?—a blackamoor! God!—if his horrible lips should profane her forehead, even upon the stage, the stomachs of the very mob would revolt—and they would sicken with horrour and execration—hiss them off the stage. Look at Romeo and Juliet—that scene of tenderness, too, where the lover meets his beloved in moonlight, and silence—what does he? Is his language broken —disordered—passionate? Oh, no—But he makes love in a set speech, so that it has really been a serious question, with me, whether it would not be well to consider the whole as a travestie, like “High life below stairs”—a valet making love to a lady's woman. You think this blasphemy. I see you do. But read that speech again, and tell me if you would not think as I do, if you heard any mortal man address such stuff to any woman. What of Macbeth too—and his witches? O we well deserve the sneer of that consummate scoffer, who selects that, as the master piece of our greatest dramatist. What of king Richard III.—and Lady Anne! Look at it—a woman—a princess—going through the publick street, with the body of her dead husband, youthful and beautiful—is arrested by a monster of deformity—a fiend—reeking hot, from the slaughter of that husband:—he kneels to her, in the street, in the presence of the corpse—in the face of heaven—in the very presence too of the common soldiery—and there wins her to prostitution—publickly! publickly! By the—I wont swear—but if any man now, were to produce such an outrage upon all decency and common sense, as that, he would be lampooned as an ideot, a madman, from one end of the country to the other: nay more —I do contend that Shakespeare never wrote a tragedy, no, not one, which if it were to come out now, from any unknown author, would be tolerated for an hour, a single hour—no actor would play it—no printer publish it—and no human being sit out the reading of it. Try it yourself—attempt to read it—read it as well as you can—and you are wearied to death of it. It excites no emotion in you—nor in your hearers. Duncan is murdered—and a terrified attendant comes in exclaiming—yes really—that he, he himself has just left the murdered old man, the monarch—and that his “silver skin was laced with his golden blood!” and so with every play that he ever wrote. It is full of trash —distortion in language, sentiment, and character. And yet he, Shakespeare, has been called the high priest of nature. Nature!—O, would you know, if there be nature in the tremendous offspring of Shakespeare, go and unveil them to the savage—nay, to the refined and sublimated—(if they be not the countrymen of Shakespeare)—and what is their answer? Shakespeare was wonderful—he startles—terrifies—and astonishes. But he is unnatural—tiresome—and childish; full of obscure ribaldry, and grotesque caricatures—rhodomontade and insupportable trick.” “He was silent; and we were breathless. Surely, said I, you are beside yourself. Would you leave nothing to this “Magician?” Yes—his wand—his ministering Ariel, with her delicate spiriting, and his imperial conceptions of madness—nothing more—and I would purge him, and his works seven times over, before I would permit either to become a standard with them that I love. What was left, would be the purest element—I do admit,—that ever was extracted from mortality. It would be the otto of genius.” I laughed—for who could help it; and he was fain to accompany me. What extraordinary self possession he has. The more that he has to oppose, the more proof he can throw into action. “I never saw one, who so rose with the occasion,” said Mr.—after he had done. A calmer and more temperate discussion followed, between him and the professor, whom you so respected, you know, for his gravity and collectedness. But even with him, he was at home. The subject was one that I could not understand—very metaphysical—but I observed that the professor treated him with the most profound respect, and frequently manifested his astonishment, *17 by the most unequivocal tokens. You know his fine eyes—they actually sparkled with delight at times, while Oscar was talking to him, in his earnest way—in a very low voice.—I tried not to listen —but it was in vain—I can hear no voice but his, and I am not the only one—others listen as I do, with intense interest—and anxiety. He keeps you constantly agitated—or rather, he can, if he please. Farewell! dear Mary— Elvira. May— A long time has passed, I admit it. O, Mary! —I cannot—cannot tell you what I have suffered. I have been sick, sick unto death. Twice have we been nigh a separation—O Mary! can it be! What would become of us—of me—!—Indeed, indeed, I know not. He would bear it better than I—he is older—has had experience before, in this terrible passion—and could turn his attention, immediately, to some object that would employ all his faculties. But I—O, I could not. The world would be a blank to me. My heart would stop—crumble, perish in dust and ashes, I am sure that it would. But no—his passions would destory him. He would fall by his own hand—I know he would, if he should think me unworthy. I know not why, dear Mary, but sometimes I think of him, till I am trembling from head to foot. He is so ambitious—so passionate.—Indeed, Mary, I have a terrible feeling of dismay pass over my heart, like a cold wind, at times. What shall I do? Would he survive a separation? once, I am sure that he would not; once, with his pride and revenge, he would have wrought some tremendous retribution. We have spoken of the possibility—and shuddered as we spoke—that we might be separated; his voice was hollow with emotion —but very tender and kind. There is no great difference in our ages—and the probability is, therefore, that we may die near together—perhaps, in each others arms —O—I would not be the survivor!—I could not. He wants me to write to him, if he go to France.—I cannot. You know the reason of my repugnance. But he approves of my refusal. Yet that is in character —there is no selfishness in his love—he would rather die, I am sure, than that I should do aught that was imprudent. It is either consummate generalship, or consummate love. I have been trying to interest him in our missionary society—but he puts all that out of my head at once—in this way. “What is your object? —to give the bible to the heathen? The bible is a code of laws. `Where there is no law, there is no transgression.' Without the bible therefore, they cannot sin against it—with it, they may. Is it wise to send it among them then?” Is there not some fallacy in this? I fear that there is, and yet I cannot see it—perhaps, because it came from him!—adieu—adieu!— May— O, Mary, I am happy beyond expression—he has bowed down his whole nature, imperial as it is, to the touch of gentleness. What a strange being! I should not be surprised if, from being the haughtiest and sternest man of his age, he should be the meekest and gentlest. I weep when I think of it—and he too, can weep—I have felt his tears fall upon my hand —I am glad of it—it gives me a better opinion of his heart—it is true, that I thought he was strangling, and I—I was almost distracted and blind at the time, but he wept, and my hand felt as if it were blistered, where his hot tears fell.—People say that love is blind. I do not believe it Mary. It is not. Are parents blind? No—they see all the faults of their children; perhaps many, that others do not see, but they see many virtues that others do not. So with a lover—he sees all the faults of her that he loves. And why not? Is he not always on the watch—intensely alive and active, with every faculty? and can it be, that the cold, and careless, and indifferent, shall see our elements more readily than he, whose eyes are always poring over them? Would that I could tell you all, dear, but I cannot; I only pray that when your time comes, you may meet with some one as gentle (I am sure that you smile now—but to me, he is gentle) as devoted, and as tender to you, as Salisbury is to me. I am becoming too proud of him, I fear—Mary, I could take that man by the hand, though he had not a friend, nor a guinea in the world, and go out with him, before the face of all mankind, and cry—lo! My husband! A strange incident occurred last night,—my cheeks burn at the thought—and I am really half ashamed to relate it; yet this letter was begun, chiefly with the intention of telling it. But why should I be ashamed? —it has become a duty for me to think of such endearing relationship—but no—I cannot go on. My lips thrill—and my veins tingle at the thought.— I have become more composed. I will tell it. You heard me mention a beautiful little boy lately, that Mr. Hammond has adopted. I was caressing it last night, when your old acquaintance Sir Harry Mainwaring, came in. He was introduced to me, and as he bowed, I observed that he called me madam. I took no notice of it, however, and he began romping with William. Oscar sat next to me, and I was playing with the boy's hair. “A sweet child!” said Sir Harry, glancing at Oscar—and then at me “you ought to be proud of him.” Oscar averted his head, but not until his dark eyes had flashed fire into my heart. I thought that I should have sunk upon the floor. I could not lift my eyes, and the Baronet, —the stupid wretch, persisted in his errour, until aunt Harriet saw it, and benevolently relieved us. But O, Mary, what a strange shivering came over me, as I next met the bright eyes of Oscar—and, saw his lips opening, as he bent toward me, and uttered some kind remark to reassure me. To be a mother —!—Mary—of such a cherub as that—to see a father's heart run over, as he kissed it—O, I should be delirious at the thought. Farewell!—farewell!—my temples ache with the rapid irritation of my blood—I cannot permit myself to think of such an event. And all that I say is this—a humble prayer—that if I am to be a mother—our Father, who is in heaven, will qualify me to discharge the ample obligations of one— The next letter that Harold found—was sealed with black—his hand shook as he opened it. There was a long interval between the dates.—Here it is.— “It is all over!—O, Mary, Mary, he has deceived me!—we—we are parted forever. Oscar, Oscar! where art thou?—where am I?—would that I had never waked!— That woman—that dreadful woman. I had all along such a prophetick sense of this—and now it has come at last. O, Mary, dear—the curse has fallen. My heart is dissolving. The preternatural dread that I felt for her—the horrour that I had of her name—it is all accounted for now. Mary---Mary---would you believe it---O, I cannot write it. How spotless, how lofty he appeared. I believed him---and now, oh my God, my God!---it has come to this---Mary---I will write it—I will, though my heart burst. Oscar was guilty—There—I have written it—and yet I am alive. I have written it—borne testimony against him before the throne of heaven—and yet—I only feel a sort of tightness over my breast—would that I could weep —I'd give the world to weep. Mary dear, I am very sick—Do you love me yet?—will you weep for me. Do, dear Mary—it will make me happy, I am sure it will—the earth will lie lighter on my heart. Tears! —yes, yes—one—two—O, what a relief! only think Mary—guilty after all—to have been touched—caressed—doated on—by one, who has been familiar with a wanton. O, I wish that I could laugh—I try—but I am frightened at the echo—O, why did he tell it, Mary? I should have been so happy else. Did he seek to rid himself of me? O, Oscar, Oscar! thou little knowest the heart that thou hast lost!—Wilt thou ever find such another?—Never—never! But one week—nay not a week—(only six days)— hath passed—then I would have laid down my life that he was innocent—But now—O Mary—would that thou wast here—that I might go to sleep, forever, upon thy bosom.—But no—I am alone—Nobody understands my feeling. My pride is appealed to. Alas!—I have no pride. He is disloyal—I am told—True, but then it was before he knew me—and he tells of it himself. But six days—and then, O, how his eyes flashed—how his locked hands shook!—how his lips quivered, as he denounced one who had been impure—notoriously so— one whom he heard us speak well of. O, why did he tell!—I cannot forgive him—he knows that I cannot. If I did, he would despise me.—Farewell! farewell! I know not what has become of him—but for me—I am the veriest wretch on earth. My God! My God! why hast thou forsaken me! O, take me away—I cannot live—I do not wish to live another hour. Why did I ever survive my last sickness? O, that I had died!— O, do thou support and sustain me! Strengthen my heart!—And, do thou spare him—poor Oscar—my heart bleeds for thee—O, spare him, Father of Mercies! spare his senses—!— — Here ended the catastrophe. Harold could read no further. He was blinded by his tears. The mystery was solved—he shut his eyes—and contemplated the whole anew. How like his own fate! Oscar, the proud, the unspeakably proud Oscar, had loved— been loved in return, to madness—to idolatry—to desolation and death. They had been torn asunder—How, just as he and Loena had been. Could it be—had he not been reading the history of his own life? Whence this mysterious resemblance? Could it be, that their fates were alike—their destinies alike! Oscar had been torn away from that heart to which his cleaved—and given to the waves—was it to be his fate too? Why left he his solitude—why? But to be wrecked and shattered —and driven, intellect and life, forever and ever, before the tempestuous visitations of heaven!—No wonder that he had slain his fellow men! No—the wonder was that that he had not made war upon the whole human family!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. So Harold thought. Alas, Harold knew not how potent is the rebuke of heaven to the imperious and lofty of heart. They feel. They, although they stand upright, like the everlasting oak, while the thunder is breaking above and about them, they are quaking, in secrecy, at the root, while the feeble in heart, the willow and the sapling, are only moved outwardly by the presence of the Almighty. The right thought came at last, in the real destiny of Oscar. Harold saw it, and read, with trembling joints, like the Babylonish monarch, a preternatural warning, on the solid wall, before him—It was the fate of himself— the history of his brother. Every limb of his frame shook: he arose, and attempted to fortify himself by recalling the past—and stretching toward the future. But —it was all in vain. There was no past—to him. It had gone forever. There was no future—it had not arrived. There was no present—for while he lifted his foot to take possession of it—it had vanished! The past, with all its woods, and mountains, and forests—the war and the chase—the Indian—and the panther—faded away, as he looked upon them, like a continent, in the downward glance of an eagle, in his most perpendicular ascent. While he clapped his wings over them—they were gone! They were dust and smoke. And the future then—like a world newly opening, with all its proportions, upon some creature waking, like Eve from the trance, and deep sleep, of her creation—was too overpowering and blinding, for untried faculties. Cheerfulness was behind him, like the recollection of our own fireside, when we are cold, and wet, and weary, and among strangers—an adventure was before him, like the panoplied spectre that a young knight sees, in his first dreaming, amid piles of shivered helmets, and battered cuirasses, on the eve of his first tournament. But Harold slept at last; and a sweet, refreshing sleep it was to him; the first for many nights. Nay, he slept so long, that the sun stood, curbing his red steeds, upon the very keystone of the zenith—that is, it was about noon, when Harold arose. A gentle tap at the door awoke him. He had dreamed, but a moment before, of the rattling of carriage wheels. He was terrified—and, when he looked at his watch, stared, much as one of the seven sleepers probably would, in looking at an almanack when he awoke. He found Caroline expecting him in the parlour— “My dear brother!” said she, the tears starting into her beautiful eyes, as he caught her hands, and held the dear little fingers again and again to his lips. She was pale— very pale—and had slept little—Harold was speaking of it when Mr. Hammond himself entered—followed by a man, with whose carriage Harold was exceedingly struck. He was a tail thin man—with a very dark, melancholy eye, thick lashes, and black, strong brows—with something severe, yet not forbidding, in his countenance, and, on the whole, a physiognomy—particularly when he talked, for his voice was musick, and his smile warmth— singularly interesting. “It is Oxford,” said Caroline, softly,—watching the direction of Harold's eyes. “Is it possible!” cried Harold—“Well, he is the very man that I most wished to see, and exactly what I expected to see.” Saying this, he immediately addressed himself to him, but was thunderstruck at the emotion that Oxford betrayed, the moment that he distinctly heard his voice. His dark eyes filled—his lip trembled— and he arose and walked to the window, in silence. “I love that man!” said Harold, emphatically. “You will do more,” said Mr. Hammond to him, in reply. “You will venerate him. Every body loves him.” “I am glad that you are come,” said Caroline, to Mr. Hammond, “I am so glad.” “Why, dear?” said the benevolent old man, “is your new brother inclined to be very unruly?” “No, but a little tardy, as you see. But—(she hesitated) Vol. II. 18 there are many things for him to be informed of relating to—” Mr. Hammond patted her shoulder, as he answered— “Yes, child, there are. I'll tell them myself—we will take an hour's turn on horseback—perhaps call on Sir Ralph—and,—trust the whole affair to me. We shall be back, I dare say, in season for supper—whatever may happen.” The horses were now at the door, and Mr. Hammond, who mounted and sat the saddle like a piece of machinery, dovetailed and locked to it, could not help exclaiming “Well done!” as Harold, laying his hand lightly on the mane of his horse, threw himself into the seat, without touching the stirrup; and galloped off, down the green slope, yielding and swaying to the motion of the animal, as if the two, horse and rider, were one body, governed by one will; while the creature struck his iron-bound hoofs into the flint walk, till the fire flew out as thickly, as from a blacksmith's forge, and his glistening and beautiful tail flourished, like a banner of white combed silk, behind. “I have taken you out,” said Mr. Hammond, “that I may tell you more about your family. With whom shall I begin? I am ready to answer your questions.” “Tell me, I pray you, then,” said Harold, with eagerness and solemnity, “tell me of Oscar. I have read the letters—what kind of a boy was he?” “From my first recollection of him,” said Mr. Hammond, reigning his horse, and adjusting himself in the stirrups, while he drew off a milk-white glove, and placed his hand upon the pummel of the saddle, as if preparing for no light matter, “he was remarkable for distinctness of character. Whatever he did or said, was peculiar, prompt, and strong. He was passionate and headstrong, but generous beyond example. He had a heart of uncommon sensibility, and a countenance, till it grew dark with evil passion, of perfect transparency. You could see his thought, before it was uttered. We were alarmed, as his character began to emerge, by its magnificent proportions. It was shut, sealed up, and hidden for a long while; and we even thought him a coward—” “A what! sir—” —“Nay, nay—I do not say that he was a coward, but that we thought him so. But he soon undeceived us—he bore, till he could bear no longer—and left his oppressor, weltering in his own blood, in church—at the communion table. I never forgave him for it—although he was curelly wronged.” “Not yet—sir—not even yet—?” No!—It was unmanly—and terrible. But let us leave this—in his very childhood, these symptoms appeared. He was once stabbed in the side, mortally, we thought at first, but we never knew it, till his shoes were full of blood, and he fainted away, while he was talking to his mother. He was scarred all over—particularly about the temples—and every scar was the evidence of some desperate adventure, or miraculous escape. I always predicted that he would be a distinguished man—but I always feared that he would not be a good one. He was another Alcibiades—with tenfold determination of character, and none of his effeminacy. Every feature of his mind was strong and decided. But that, which above all others distinguished him, was his insatiable curiosity —and appetite for the mysterious, and forbidden.” “But are not these things common to many, in their boyhood—and only remembered as emphatick and peculiar, in consequence of unexpected greatness? Do not all children sometimes do, or utter things, that are wonderful? If they die young, or unknown, at any age— these incidents of promise are forgotten.” “Harold!”—said Mr. Hammond—“You have spoken the very words—in the very tone—that your brother would speak, were he here. Every time that you open your lips, I tremble—You perceive that I am blind of one eye—and this scar (laying his hand upon his forehead) is a severe one. I am indebted to your brother for both.” “You!—how?—” “I was the man whom he, a mere boy, struck at the communion table. You are amazed. Yes, it was myself. I had wronged him—and I was much older—it changed my character; and I can truly say, that I forgive him for the blow, and the consequences—but not yet, do I pardon his awful violation of the place. Judge then, if I have not cause to tremble!” Harold was silent with admiration and respect. “Thy brother,” continued Mr. Hammond, “was not like other boys. At times nothing could move him—he would sit, moping, for days and days, under that old tree, where we turned off”—Harold remembered it—it was very grand and beautiful—“at others, nothing could daunt or intimidate him—or quell his activity. For weeks, he would ramble among the mountains—in storm and wind; in night, and darkness, and starlight. It was enough for him, at the age of twelve, to know that there was something, which no other boy dared to do—for him to attempt it, at the peril of his bones—and very rarely did he fail in the attempt. I have known him to accomplish that, which would thrill thy blood to hear mentioned. On one occasion, I remember, that he was in pursuit of some animal that he saw above him—there were two ways of reaching him—one, by descending the cliff on this side and ascending the other—a second to leap into a chasm, the bottom of which could not be distinctly seen, and ascend a tottering mass of snow, which was actually shivering in the wind. Before I could prevent him, he dashed into the abyss—where there were many chances to one that the loose snow would swallow him— and before I could recover from the horrour that it caused me, I heard the report of a musket, and the next moment saw the animal, wounded, endeavouring to ascend by the side of the loose, overhanging mass of snow— Oscar followed—and the moment that his feet struck it—it shook and crumbled. I saw his danger—and shouted He felt it himself at the same moment, and leaped from his perilous height down upon the very spot where I stood, just as the mass, detached by his weight, came thundering by us—blinding us with its whirling dust— and jarring the mountain, under our feet, like an earthquake. Another moment, and he would have been buried hundreds of feet below, in a world of snow, which might never have melted, in the deep cavity where it fell, till the last day. But this is only one, among a thousand of his mad adventures. He belonged to a corps of young men, at one time, whose practice it was to fire at cards, held off at arm's length, by each other, and was once shot through the wrist, in consequence of his taking a distance that nobody else dared to take. “All this desperate enterprise argued well for his character, if it were profitably directed. It was a spirit kindled by Heaven, by whom nothing is kindled in vain, for the noblest purposes; and only wanted feeding and tending, to become a wonder and a marvel upon earth. “His anger was terrible, but brief, too, as the lightning. And even now, I feel assured, after much observation of his character, that most of his petulance and violence was assumed. At an early period, he became passionately addicted to reading, and read with a voracious and indiscriminate appetite, whatever came in his way. He was constantly terrifying all that knew him; not that he showed much evil nature, but because he showed some, and we supposed that the worst, in him as in other men was hidden. But it was not so. He scorned to conceal any thing. He always put the worst outward. He grew, at one time, fond of the quiet and inoffensive; and delighted in taking their part, and fighting their battles. At the same time, he trampled down, in scorn and insult, the tyrants of society. He never threatened—but there were those, before whom brave men had trembled, that trembled in their turn, when they encountered the dark eyes of Oscar. He never spared them—and they knew that, while he had life in him, he could not be brought to spare them. They shook in his presence—as if a strong shadow had fallen upon their hearts, and chilled them like a malediction. At last he changed— devoted himself to some secret study—toiled night and day—lived like a hermit—suffered nobody to come near him—and never left his room for years. And when he came abroad, his manners were hardly of this world. *18 They belonged to another age—haughty and repulsive— mysterious and forbidding. From his very boyhood, he had no associates—no playmates—no companions, to talk with, or walk with. His companions were men—and his amusements were those of a man. This again was regarded as a bad symptom. What can he be about? said one. Is it true that he spends his nights in study? Doubts went abroad. He was known to be ambitious— but then he was so obscure—that there could be no risk, men thought, even if he were plotting treason. Alas! they knew not, that when the poison is concocted by such a heart—a drop of it may poison a whole state. “Doubts were abroad, I said—and they, who ought to have been kind, and charitable, to thy poor brother, were the most unkind and uncharitable. But—that is passed—Thy brother heeded it not. He cared not what men thought of him; and went on, doing his duty, in pride and sullenness—like some one, who has no feeling of earth—no sense of human infirmity, no dependence upon time; but looks to the future, and sets his foot upon it, with the strength and collectedness of a giant—making it like the present, by his preternatural steadiness. “We awoke at last from our trance, we broke in upon the retirement of Oscar, and dragged him forth to the light, with all his labours. They were those of a life. Piles of manuscript—systems—studies—involving the most profound abstraction of the spirit, were all found within his study. He had achieved what would have been wonderful in any body, during a whole life, with confirmed habits of study—He, with no habit of the sort, had achieved a miraculous labour, and amassed a treasury of learning. “But—after all—the one thing needful was wanting —a vital religion. He was careless—impious—nay, blasphemous at times. He grew fond of metaphysicks,—I trembled for him. But he strode onward, through all their dimness and obscurity, till there was no barrier left to him—in heaven or earth. He stood and interrogated the Almighty God, himself, like one having authority therefor. He went abroad through space—and then, because he found no resting place, like the bird from the ark,—then only, came he back. He returned again to his studies; betook himself to sublimated speculation of a more worldly nature. And then followed the time, Harold—when thy brother was a more dangerous man to his country—than was ever Cæsar or Cataline to his. While we were looking upon him, as a growing honour to the nation, he lay, preparing and compounding the elements of a more bloody, and tremendous revolution to his country, than ever before shook its foundations. And, feeble as he was—the king himself turned pale, upon his throne, when the plans of Oscar, their extent and secrecy; and his resources, (for he had managed to embark the wealth and ability of an empire, in his undertaking), were laid bare before him. Another step, had sent him to the scaffold. But this he knew—and went fearlessly before the privy council, and set them at defiance, demanding his papers, and mocking and deriding them, and their master. “He failed—why?—not because of any fault in him; for this I will say for Oscar—that, what any man could do, if he thought it worth his ambition to attempt, he would do, better—always, where it depended upon himself. “A fact, particularly striking in his character, and recollected now, by all that ever saw him, though it was overlooked then, is this. He seemed to hold an undisputed, indisputable dominion over all that approached him—young or old—wise or simple—phlegmatick or passionate. It was all the same to him—he ruled them, as with a rod of iron; and they loved and served him, like slaves, without knowing it! and they would fire in the contact with his spirit.—At last he loved. Never shall I forget the time—or the woman. His whole nature changed. Ha! you are pale—are you ill, Harold?” “No no—proceed—I am very well—was it Elvira?—” “No—it was another. I knew it not for some time. He was deeply involved in a litigation, which threatened to deprive him of his patrimony. To this, I attributed his melancholy. At last, however, I found out the truth. Oscar had begun to love.— He told me his story—when I believe that he would not have told it to his Maker. She was young, fascinating, and from all that I could learn, passionately attached to Oscar; but, like him, she had no piety—no feeling of religion—none of obligation or accountability. I was sorry; but I did not despair. I saw that the waters might be troubled, in the deep places of Oscar's soul; and I prayed that the angel of the Lord might be there for a while. His law suit grew more threatening. He determined to leave her free, unembarrassed, and ignorant of his love, if he failed.” “I met him, soon after his acquaintance with the lady. He was extremely altered; by his high pale forehead—his sunken eye—I should have thought that he had just risen from a sick bed. His feelings were all at war within him. He took my hand. A tear—the first that I had ever seen there—stood in his eyes—his voice trembled. Harold—old as I am—I could weep like a child, at the recollection. With all his faults, thy brother had the noblest nature—would that he had trodden the appointed road!—O, he would have been a godlike creature. But let me return—He took my hand—his chest heaved—and a convulsive shivering followed, as if his heart were a little rebellious, and he would rebuke it unto death—one short, quick effort —his voice was like that of one suffocating inwardly —as by the rupture of all his blood vessels.— “`Hammond!' said he, pressing my hand, (I can feel it now, as I hope for mercy! O,—it is thy hand! —) `Hammond!—she is unworthy.”' “He dropped my hand, and staggered two or three steps, before he recovered himself—but when he did, and turned his dark, melancholy, motionless eyes upon me—his face was like that of a corpse—`It is the last!' said he,—dashing off a tear—it is the last!—and it was the last—he never shed another tear for her. “I was inconceivably affected. I feared for his senses. He saw it—`O, no—no, no!'—he said—`no! —I am safe. It is all over now, my brain is seared —it is bone—all over bone. A whole week has gone since I suspected her. This morning—not an hour since, my suspicions became certainty: and now—now! Hammond we are asunder, forever and ever!—' I fell upon his neck; I knew what he suffered, and I felt inexpressibly proud of him. To withstand such a shock would require great power in any; but for one, organized like Oscar, to bear up against it, was wonderful. He was of a nature to admit when he loved, the death and darkness of that passion (of love) into his vitals. But it was his salvation—a new impulse was given to him. He was cast in his law suit, and ruined. I offered him my home, heart, and purse. He rejected all but my love; others offered him the same. But he was not to be moved. `Of what avail is all that I have learnt,' said he, `all my better experience, if I am to be helpless and dependant at my age. No—I would sooner be a burden to the parish, than to them that love and respect me—nay of the two, I will steal, rob, murder—before I will beg. No,—by mine own hands will I live—or—by mine own hands will I die. But come, come—we shall never get along at this rate—.” The horses were standing stock still, and Harold, grasping the hand of Mr. Hammond, was listening with the most breathless attention. Harold struck his spurs home—and his horse leaped off, like an old hunter at the cry of hounds.— “Have a little patience!” cried Mr. Hammond, pushing after him.— “Surely, I have as little as you could desire,” answered Harold, as soon as he could get his breath —“and yet, I could listen forever, to you, on this theme.” “He left us,” continued Mr. Hammond,—“entered into foreign service, as a volunteer, and literally fought his way up, to a considerable command. At this time too, his talents in diplomacy became singularly conspicuous —he was employed in a difficult negociation abroad, by our cabinet, which, it is said, he managed like a statesman—and we believe this, because he continued to be a favourite with his king even to his death—and I have the plan of a campaign now by me, which has been publickly, upon the floor of parliament, said to exhibit the proof of consummate generalship, and acquaintance with the military art. His nature changed again. He was no longer haughty—he was only serious. He was no longer abrupt and passionate, but calm, dignified, and benignant. Men wondered at it—but I did not. I knew his habits. The poorer he was, the prouder. Why? Because if poor, he could not be magnanimous or polite, or conciliating, or kind, without subjecting himself to the reproach of sycophancy, or something worse. As he became of consequence, this reason perished. `I have tried many of those who now follow me,' said he to me, one day, as I met him at the zenith of his power—`but they have been found wanting. I could avenge myself now, for their neglect, when I was poor and unknown—but I will not. I forgive them. I am weary at last, of being feared and hated—I will be loved.—' “This was the very spirit that I had waited for. His mind, I saw, was working itself clear. I had seen it in its commotion, whirling, foaming and thundering; but now it grew calmer, and smoother, and more beautiful, after every visitation of the wind—and widened and deepened its banks, and shores, and foundations. Heaven be praised!—the reformation had begun, and I looked forward to the time, when I should see Oscar happy, and making others happy—loving and beloved.” “What became of his loved one?” said Harold. “She married,—and died, but the other day, of a broken heart. Oscar was her best friend, on this earth, while he lived,—and when he departed, even her children themselves, were as shadows to her, whom the reality of life hath passed. He continued to see her, after her marriage:—it was a path of danger, and I warned him of it. But he heeded me not—strong, in the confidence of his own rectitude, he continued braving all its perils, and did his duty, in purity and blessedness, without one thought, word, or deed, I verily believe, that would have sullied the heart of an immortal spirit.” Harold looked at the old man, whose dark blue eyes were lighted up—and the pupils seemed enlarging, while he raised his trembling hands to heaven, in the earnestness of his asseveration. “O my brother!” articulated Harold, “would that I resembled thee entirely!” “What!” cried Mr. Hammond, “what do I hear! Young man, you know not what you say. Already your resemblance is too great. Beware of this spirit. It was the spirit that destroyed the eldest born of your father— and the first born of the first man. It was born in blood. Beware of tempting the Almighty. Avoid danger, if thou wouldst be sure of not falling. It is enough to meet it, when it cannot be avoided or averted. It is impious to court it. But to thy brother—Long and long after this disappointment, I observed a remarkable expression of mildness and patience in his deportment. It grew more and more conspicuous, every day. He was in love again, and she, whom he loved, was then the kindest and gentlest of human beings. I sought the cause of this alteration. He was too noble and frank of heart to deny it. He told me that he had seen, by chance, an innocent and lofty creature—where she ought not to be—annoyed by men that could not understand her, and dared not love her. His colour came and went, as he said this; and, for the first time in his life, when speaking with me, his eye-lids dropped and trembled. He affected to speak with some levity upon the subject, but it only distressed him, and his spirit arose, and shook herself free, all at once from the darkness and mystery that incumbered her—he looked me in the face—`Hammond,' said he—`I think that woman is worthy of me; if she be, and I can win her, I will.' “I made some inquiries, and soon found that he was the delight and pride of those, whose influence would probably be decisive—but Oscar scorned to depend upon any other influence than his own—he forbad all interference—and begged to be left unaided, unprayed for, to win her or to lose her. His principles were sublime. His very errours were sublime. He was not the man to penetrate into any dwelling, secretly, or doubtfully. He acted like a man of honour—he applied to men first, and satisfied their judgments, and apprised them of his intentions, long before he had come to any determination respecting the lady. He was not the man, to win his way first— into the soul of a young, innocent, and warm hearted girl, as if such a prize were only to be stolen—and then, when sure of it, to ask leave, in mockery, to visit it. No!—But he knew that she could not judge of him, but by an intimacy—and that, then it would be too late to judge, in all probability—and that, at first, there were those about her who could calmly and dispassionately decide for her, while yet there was no danger to either— not whether she should love him or not—but whether he should be permitted to visit her, with his views and pretensions. He applied to them first—and to her last—advising her to believe and listen to their judgment—and her own feeling—at the very time, that he communicated the heaving of his heart. He soon became the subject of publick remark. It was evident to all that something preyed upon his vitals. He waned—and waned—till his hue and aspect were cadaverous; and many who knew not the iron of his constitution, saw in this, rather the symptom of a mortal disease, in its last ravages, than the nightly depredations of an unquiet spirit. “Suddenly his countenance changed—his very step. I asked the reason. For her sake, he had revealed himself, long before the appointed time. He, in his own manner, sought not her decided affirmative to his suit; for he knew that their happiness must depend upon no precipitate judgment—all he asked was—if he were to be refused, and she already knew it—to be told so. If not refused, her acceptance was not to be inferred therefrom, but left to a future acquaintance. “From that moment, he was an altered man. He became more humble, quiet and benignant. Indeed, I am sure, from what I saw of this short acquaintance, that there was nothing, nothing, within the compass of love and duty, which Oscar would not have submitted to, while she permitted him to love and venerate her. All eyes were upon them. They seemed fitted for each other. Alike in many things—in their appearance—taste and inclinations—not unlike in temper, training, and deportment, they were fitted for union, unison, and companionship, of the most sublimated and enduring nature. Such was her influence indeed—that Oscar came to be considered as a religious man. He had always been so, at the heart—but now, it was less carefully hidden. He had been, to my knowledge, always grateful for kindness, and submissive, yielding, under calamity. I never heard him repine—and I do not believe that any human being ever heard him utter one word of complaint, under any trial. Yea—such was his love, and her dominion, that I verily believe her to have been the only living creature, whom he had known so long, to whom he never did, and never could, speak unkindly. “But—now comes the catastrophe. I cannot proceed—wait a moment—let me recall the distressing prelude—” As he said this, the old man turned aside his horse, for a moment, and passed the back of his hand over his eyes —and affected to be disturbed by the dust—and his voice quavered when he renewed the tale— “She loved him, passionately—passionately, I am sure. It was evident to all that saw her. Her looks— her eyes—her voice—were all full of the passionate, eloquent, delicate, mysterious significance of love. Every hour, she became more lovely, intelligent, and watchful; and every hour, he became nearer and dearer to her. But —alas poor Oscar!—they parted—merciful Heaven!— the dust choaks and blinds me—let us turn off to the green sward—” Poor Hammond!—they were then upon the wild heath!—where dust had never been seen. “They parted forever!—with her own hand, she rent asunder their convulsively intertangled heartstrings—the Vol. II. 19 crimson filaments of love, that had twined and intertwined, till every fibre, at the most delicate touch—thrilled, and trembled, and shivered through two hearts, at the same instant, communicating, with electrick rapidity, every tremulous pulsation, from one to the other. Yes! with her own hand, mistaken but heroick woman! she tore asunder two hearts that had grown together, as she would have plucked away a cancer, from her bosom, by the roots. “I saw him. I remembered his first love. But that was not like this. Then he shed a few tears—I was told; —here, for a time, he shed none. The edges of his eye-lid were like burning wire—and the balls throbbed under their tightness. Then, he felt humbled, trampled on, debased, because he had loved one who was unworthy— one that had fallen, in the trial of love. Now he grew produer and prouder of her who had loved him—as her blows fell the heavier—upon his shattered and crumbling heart. I was with him night and day. A stranger would have discovered nothing remarkable in his manner—an acquaintance or common friend, nothing more than a greater seriousness. But I—I saw his eyes grow dim, and heard his voice falter, when he was, as others thought, profoundly occupied in matters, that had no relation to his suffering. There was no agitation—none outward, I mean. But his countenance—O, Harold!—it was the settled and deathlike tranquility of one that has no hope: of one that is dying—and is glad of it—while other men are asleep: of one that loves to look upon his own heart while it is dissolving—to watch the decomposition of its material, as he would a process of forbidden alchymy— regarding its ashes and death, as the gentlest and most precious of transmutation—its bleeding and tears, as the true elixir of life—the essence of immortality. “I strove to awaken him. He was calm, insufferably calm. For a moment, like on who cannot at once crush the rebellion of his heart, he would arise, and walk strongly across his apartment, with folded arms, and compressed lips; like one taking command of a mutinous army—for two or three times—and then return, with a sort of stern composure, to his accustomed labour. “He came to my house one day. His eyes were brighter than usual—his mouth redder. `I shall return to the cottage,' said he. “I was sorry—there was a deep brilliancy under his lashes as he spoke, that troubled me. It was the hue of a fire, about to break out. I dissuaded him, for a day or two, during which time, I saw him repeatedly upon his knees. There grew upon his countenance a more awful solemnity and fixedness—and the last night, that he was with me, he continued writing, at intervals, till day-light, and was seen to pace backward and forward, during the greater part of it. He refused to appear at breakfast— and would not be disturbed, alleging great weariness and desire of sleep. A few hours after, he sent for me—and said, putting a sealed letter into my hand—“There—that contains all that I have to say to her. It is for her sake that it is written. I care not what becomes of me. But her happiness is too precious to me—and I have made to it the offering of all my pride—all—all! It was my duty to stoop, to court, to solicit her reconsideration of the affair—not that I would persuade, but convince her. I scorn to influence her judgment or heart, on a question so momentous to her happiness—but I have never seen her since the disclosure, and she may think that I was too proud to see her or soothe her. I was not—I loved her—I reverenced her, too much to attempt aught that might lead her to reproach me, hereafter, if we were reconciled. No—Hammond, were I sure that she would take me to her bosom again, as fondly, as devotedly as ever, I would not humble myself more than I have. This letter contains all that I shall ever address to her. Her happiness is at stake. If she accept it, she shall be happy. I can make her so—and I will. If she reject it—I shall not complain. It is her right to judge—but if she reject it, it is my fear that she will have given the death blow to her own heart. At present, we are both so situated, I believe, that either would advance, if sure that the other would accept. “In this letter, I have laid bare my whole life—exposed all my follies—reasoned with her, as if I were not concerned in her decision—as if I were her brother, not her lover. All my aggravated guilt is there —all my exasperated feeling. She thinks me altogether darker of principle, and more dangerous of temper than I am. Yet—I never deliberately wronged a human being; and never, even without deliberation, but I atoned for it afterward. My vengeance has been only a pious desire of seeing my enemies humbled! —I did not wish to set my foot upon their necks—no! —I wanted an opportunity to be magnanimous—I would have raised and embraced them—but for this, I would have tracked them the world over!—merely to forgive them—in my own way. That letter is my last. If she forgive me—she may name her own terms—I care not what they are. I am, with all my faults, Hammond, upon my soul, I am worthy of her —and I know not another woman on earth, whom I think so well fitted to make me happy. If I did not think so—you know me well enough to believe me, when I say—that I not would turn my hand upside down to change her opinion of me. Nay more—I do feel that I was “never so worthy of the love and veneration too, of any woman, or any man,” as I am at this moment. If she forgive me, and bless me—though she should require whole years of trial and proof, before she is mine, I will be all that she requires. If she say no— why then, no it is—and we never meet again. I shall bear it better than she will. I shall have as much consolation in reflecting on the past, taking it all together, as she will. I have less sensibility, am older, have more experience in these maladies of the heart—and can, immediately, turn the course and tide of my spirit into new channels.” “The letter was sent. I was astonished at Oscar's tranquility. He told the truth. He did not deceive himself. It was her happiness, not his, that he sought to insure, by this sacrifice of his master passion. Having done his duty, as a man, as a christian, a lover —he was at rest. Never shall I forget the deep and sweet composure of his manner, at the time. It was so unlike him—that it seemed little else than a miraculous quieting of his soul, by the hand of his Maker—pressing upon its tides—and lulling its currents. There were no intermittent flashes—no inquietude, and restlessness of movement in him, after this. All was calm, collected, and observant, as of one, who is at peace with all the world, without, and prepared for every thing within. The answer came the next morning. I remember that we were sitting near the breakfast table—as it was handed to Oscar. There was a sprightly, thoughtless child of mine, sitting by him,—a plump little creature —of unmanageable vivacity.” “I declare,” said she, “I wish that you would break the seal, at once—and not keep fumbling about it, all day —bless me!—why, I know that writing, I am sure—it is a Lady's—ah!— “It is,” said Oscar, in a faint voice—but his countenance altered not. “And whose, man?—out with it—not the lady, I hope—would she whistle you back?” “Octavia—” said he, mildly (and he turned his mournful eyes upon her, with such effect, that hers instantly filled.) “It is the lady—but I pray you—do not speak of her irreverently. If you should ever know her, the recollection of it, would make your heart ache.” I was utterly dismayed at his calmness—and just then, I saw his lip turn to ashy paleness—and then a swarthy crimson pass over his forehead, like a flash.— The next moment, I was aware of the result—he spoke to me of some indifferent matter, in a tone of levity, levity—but with the deep, melancholy eyes of one who is bleeding to death—inwardly.— Whether it was, that Octavia was really light headed at the time—or that she was deceived by Oscar's manner, I know not—but she pushed the arrow home. *19 “She has jilted you, I'll take my bible oath of it —look at your eyes—look! look!—” “Jilted me,” said Oscar—catching her manner, with surprising felicity—You cannot believe it possible!” “Upon my word, Sir—” was the reply—“that was prettily said! O,—if you were only my beau—lud— lud!—if I would not teach you another song!—” “I mean,” said Oscar, more seriously, “I mean, Black Eyes, that a woman of so little principle as a jilt, could never deceive me: Do you not know that.” “I!—I know of no such thing, I promise you—was'nt there that—that—confound her long unintelligible name.— “Do you mean the German Lady,” said Oscar.— “Pray Sir—let me interrupt you one moment,” said Harold, here—“I have met that Lady, I am sure—your description reminds me of her, most forcibly—but her name, if I remember, was not Octavia.— “You have! pray where?” “On my passage here—.” “An explanation followed, and Harold found that Octavia was the sister of that wild, careless creature, whom he had been so delighted with, on board the ship. She had never seen Oscar, had been to India—and was returning in a government vessel, when he met her. Mr. Hammond then continued— “Yes—the German Lady. You talk about principle—was'nt she one of your principal ladies—? and did'nt she jilt you? But I see you wont confess: So —I'll only tell you—Do you know that I am ashamed of you. You have trifled with another fine girl, here, I suspect. Oscar—I am but a child, it is true—but if you have—if you have jilted her,—O, I dont mind your terrible looks—if you have, mind now—I will quarrel with you, on the spot. You told me once that you meant to marry her. Why hav'nt you married her? Why dont you, at once? You have been of the same mind a dozen times before—within the last dozen months too, I vow—ha! ha! ha!—there is the Miss A, and Miss B—C—D—and the whole alphabet beside—and —and you have been dying for the whole of them, within a year—! O, it is a shame cousin—Is'nt there a good dozen, now—come, tell the truth, and shame the—but you'll excuse me—I dont like to be personal. Is'nt there a round dozen?—” “No”—said Oscar, in a voice that was irresistibly touching—and Black Eyes grew instantly serious—nay, the tears started again, before he had done. “No— not quite so many. But—(taking her hand)—look at me, Octavia—I loved this girl—I tried to make her love me; I succeeded. I would have married her, in time—but, much as she loved me—she has cast me off forever—.” “Why? Oscar?—” “Because her principles were alarmed.” “But—this is the—pray how many times have you been turned off now, according to the best of your recollection?” “I hardly know,” said Oscar, smiling, at the strange creature, whose lips were wet with tears, while her eyes were laughing—“but, to my best belief and understanding, I have seen, lately four or five different women married, each of whom I had thought of for a wife!—” “Did you go to their weddings? You ought to keep on good terms, coz,—for in time, it might be very convenient to dine among them—after a few more years, you might save your board by it, I dare say—by going the rounds among your rivals. But can they all give dinners?—It is dreadful to be cut out by a poorer man!” “Not so dreadful as to be cut out by a fool.” “Take care,” said Octavia—“you know not whom you may offend—we dont put up with every thing. And so they wouldnt any of them have you?” “Not one! not one!” said Oscar, in a tone irresistibly comick. I wondered at his self-command; and Octavia clapped her hands with delight. “But come, cousin,” said she—“how was it? And what do you think of it?” “I think” said he, “that Heaven has something particularly choice in store for me. And she turned me off —because—” “For what, pray?—your modesty?—your mild, amiable temper. Your—O, I am dying to know for what!” “Well, then—that you may not die in your chair—I” (And may live to die in my shoes! why dont you say— said Octavia, interrupting him)—“I will tell you.” “I shant believe you, I tell you now. If you were really turned off, you would not be so willing to own it. No! you have abandoned her.” “By Heaven!” cried Oscar, in a voice that went through and through me—“it is false!” The child was terrified— “It is false!” he repeated gravely—but firmly and distinctly. “She turned me off:—and that, too, for a fault which any other woman would have forgiven. And she never loved me more truly, I am sure, than when she tore her heart from mine.” That said, Oscar was another man! Never saw I such a sudden and complete transformation. He, as by the action of his own powerful volition alone, seemed all at once, to have reinvested himself in all his prerogatives. “A few moons,” said my child, “a few moons more, dear cousin, and all will be right.” “No—never. I have done all that I shall do. I will not—cannot advance another step. She cannot forget me—I have no fear of that:—nor do I believe that she will soon, if ever, love another.” “But she may cease to respect you, cousin, and then her love will die a natural death, you know.” “No—I have no fear of that. For a time, just for the present, under the agitation and distress of her disappointment, I believe that she may try to crush her respect for me. But it will arise again—with tenfold violence, when she comes to compare me with other men— and when she reflects on my honourable and sincere deportment toward her, during all our eventful intercourse. These recollections will come home to her heart, in the solitude of her chamber—at midnight. She cannot shut them out; and she will find then, that she has been too severe for her own happiness. Octavia—I do not pretend to prophecy—but that woman's pillow will be wet with tears yet, I am sure, for having done what her heart is now, in vain, attempting to assure, her, was her duty. She will see other men. She will become intimate with them—and when she least expects it, they will disappoint her, more cruelly than I ever did. She will compare us together, then—and she will find, perhaps, that I told her the truth, when I said that she would meet few persons with more good qualities and fewer bad ones, than I had —whom she could love. Nay more—I am sure that her respect for me, will continue to augment, until my dying day—then, and then only, perhaps, will her judgment be sufficiently illuminated to do my devotion justice. Then— when she looks up for mercy—she may remember me— when she asks to be forgiven—she may remember that I besought her forgiveness—and in vain. “I have determined upon making her venerate me: and what I have once determined on, if my Maker spare my life, and health, I already regard as accomplished.” “But I thought that you were never baffled—never disheartened, coz.” “I never was. I am not now. If my principles would let me—if I would permit myself to violate a sacred promise, or to break up the quiet of a family—one of the happiest families, too, on this earth—I would never rest now, until, by some means or other, I had that woman in my power. I should succeed at last; for desperation and perseverance never failed. But why do I not attempt it? Why!—Because her happiness is dearer to me, than my own; and because I should wrong her, my Maker, and myself. No—we are as far apart now, as we could be, in separate graves. But enough—you understand me. And for her sake, dear Octavia, if you hear this affair misrepresented—or her censured—or spoken of, as one deserted—I entreat you to say—that I love and respect her yet—and shall to my last hour—that she has deliberately turned me off—and that we are apart, not by my consent—not in a quarrel—but in consequence of her deliberate manifestation of high principle.” This was his last conversation with us, on the subject. A few days after, he embarked for France, and passed eighteen months on the continent. He came home wounded, bearing despatches to his king. He was altered yet more—was more melancholy—but very kind and solemn in his manner. In short, his deportment was princely. All hearts beat, at his approach, with the desire of making him happier. We never mentioned Elvira's name to him; yet he sometimes pronounced it, in his thrilling way, but without any apparent emotion. At length however, he heard that she was to be married—nay, we had reason to believe that he had heard of it abroad, and perhaps, that had its influence in bringing him home, so unexpectedly. I mentioned it to him—but his countenance immediately lighted up. He was constantly occupied in searching out the history of his successor; and all went well, until one day, he arrived at the bottom of a transaction, which showed that successor to be a consummate villain. Oscar assured himself of the facts—pursued him through all his haunts—and found him at last—alone—in his chamber. “Young man,” said he—“I have come to see you on a matter of some moment. Hear me patiently, I will not be interrupted. I have just left the grave of Matilda—are you shocked?—I am glad of it. You are a better man than I thought you. Her mother is at this moment standing before the bar of Almighty God!—I left her dying!—she is denouncing you, you Charles Ortley—you! as the murderer and seducer of her child! What say you—are you guilty.” “I will not be questioned in this way sir. Who are you?—I will call the watch—.” “The watch!—Boy, boy—if you but raise your voice, so that you can be heard in the next room, I'll blow your brains out on the spot. Sit still—and hear me out. I shall not harm you, if you dont provoke me.” “You are a young man of uncommon abilities, I am told—of insinuating manners—plausible—bold—and frank; specious and eloquent.—Damnation!—I cannot talk with thee, thou reptile—where is that purity—that exquisite innocence now? with thee—she coupled with thee, thou miserable wretch—polluted and stained, as thou art—will she ever permit thee to approach her—ha! ha! ha!—O, no.—” Ortley was inconceivably terrified—the incoherent manner of Oscar now, was that of a madman:—at first —his collectedness was awful—and Ortley shook like a criminal about to receive judgment. “Shall I interfere?” said Oscar, in a low soliloquy (all which was related to me, by Ortley himself afterward—) “No—that would be mistaken. I may not be believed—may not be thanked. Where are my proofs?—I have none. I am satisfied—but how can I satisfy others—without a breach of confidence. Shall I abandon her? no—no—I will not stand by, with my arms folded, and see a woman that I have loved— bound hand and foot, and offered up, a living sacrifice, before my eyes.—no!—now look you, Sir—You are pretending to the hand of Elvira—Are you not?” “By what right, do you dare to question me, in this imperious way?” said Ortley. “I shall not answer you, Sir.” “By this right,” said Oscar, “taking out his pistol, —and levelling it.—You shall answer me sir—.” “Sir,—by your bearing, I am led to believe that you are Oscar Salisbury. If you are—you cannot be a coward—for I have heard one whose opinion, is not to be disputed—bear testimony to your valour. Do you mean to murder me?—If so—fire!—I shall not flinch—or —if you will hand me another pistol—I will amuse you to your heart's content. Are you an assassin or not?” Oscar was thunderstruck. He thrust his hand impatiently into his pocket, in the hope of finding another pistol—but in vain—not perceiving the possibility of such a reception, he had come provided with only one. “Young man,”—said he—biting his lips, till the blood spurted forth—“I respect you—We shall meet again. In the mean time—there is my glove—either renounce the hand of Elvira—or prepare to meet me to-morrow, at day light—.” “To-morrow at daylight—and where you please, Sir!” said Ortley, and with such a sneer, that Oscar hurled his pistol at his head—it missed him—Ortley snatched it up and pursued him as he left the room, and snapped it at his ear—but the cold, awful aspect of Oscar, as he turned upon him, at the same moment, prevented him from renewing the attempt, and being of a spirit as generous as Oscar's, he flung the instrument through the window—and returned sullenly to his apartment—while Oscar pursued his way, as if powder and ball were harmless things. Ortley did not meet him—why, we never knew, until after his death, when we had reason to believe that Elvira had prevented it. And the next time that they met, was in my presence. I thought well of Ortley, I confess. Oscar entered the room where we all were, a few days before the time fixed upon, for Elvira's marriage, without being announced. I saw him, just as he arrived opposite Elvira, who was that moment turning to a window, which had been thrown open, and was preparing to make a sketch of the landscape. Whether it was his tread—or his suppressed breathing—or some mysterious sensation that announced the presence of Oscar, I know not—for I am sure that she did not see him—she turned deadly pale, and sunk into the window seat.— Oscar trembled—and half extended his hand, with shut eyes,—when Ortley dashed between them, and caught her, as she was falling. What a profanation, for Oscar! For a moment I thought—for I knew Oscar's temper—that Ortley would never rise from his knees again —for the red blood darkened the whole face of Oscar —and he shivered from head to foot—as he put out his hands, evidently with the power of sundering them, if they had been one body. But, at this instant, Elvira opened her eyes—coloured all over—and as if really detected in guilt, put away her second lover with an air, that I never saw upon her forehead before. At that moment I would rather have been in Oscar's, than in Ortley's place. “Lady Elvira,” said Oscar—calmly, haughtily—“I have come here on a matter of grave import. I am about to leave England, and do not mean to return. Can I be favoured with a few moments' conversation —not alone—I do not ask that—I would submit to the presence of whom you will—except that of—” He stopped—and she bowed—but merciful heaven! —never shall I forget the paleness of her mouth— and the settled, despairing, meek expression of her eyes.— “Sir,” said she—“this gentleman has a right to be present—I cannot see you alone.” “O, no, Elvira—I shall leave you. Nay—I insist upon it” said Ortley—“I waive the right to be present at such an interview—.” “Oscar—O, he stood at the sound of these words, and looked, like what he was, a being for great occasions—upon his trial. His manner and voice were solemn, deep, respectful, but nothing more, when he began; but as he proceeded, a tone of tenderness sometimes escaped him, that thrilled through and through me—my tears fell before I knew it—It was the musick of a broken heart—touched by memory—in its holiest place. He stood, I remember, as you stood this morning, when we were about to depart—with his hat under his arm. His attitude was martial and enforcing—like one familiar with dominion. “Are we alone?” said he —“free from interruption?—for only ten minutes?” He put his hand to his forehead—the sweat stood there—and Elvira was like one death struck and bewildered—the tears were gathering under her waxen lids—till they looked to me, like the tears of a corpse. I felt for him, but more for her. The trial had only begun; and, although I was sure that his manhood would carry him through it, yet I feared much that, when it was all over, like some subtly organized Vol. II. 20 machinery, held together by an invisible, mysterious power—as by the pressure of outward matter—he would fall to pieces of himself, like that, the moment that the pressure was withdrawn. I expected to see him go through it—yet I looked to the morrow, with equal certainty, that he would be delirious. I knew him, and all his springs, and self-sustaining, hidden and delicate powers. “You shall not be interrupted,” said I—“for just ten minutes,”—laying my watch upon the table, and locking the door—“whatever may be the consequences.” “Proceed, sir,” said Elvira, in a faint voice;—but the beautiful dignity of her nature was never so conspicuous. He felt her calm, majestick supremacy: but he stood before it, unreproved, unabashed. His manner, like hers, was full of simplicity and steadiness. And I—I felt that it was sublime. He was no longer the lover. She saw that. He was on some visit of duty. She trembled. While I was looking at her, her thin drapery shivered all over—her cheek flushed—and her half shut eyes shone dimly through her tremulous lids, as with some faint, but inward recollection, of a nature too tender and mysterious, for concealment or avowal—she raised them to him—and their very colour changed, as she did so! It was the deep, strange dye of passion. “I am come,” said Oscar, at last, “on a matter of momentous concern to you—lady. To yourself, alone, I would have preferred to make the disclosure, but it is more proper, perhaps, that I should not. Will you permit me to ask you—(his voice faltered)—Lady Elvira— with the privilege of one who is not entirely forgotten— as a friend—who is interested, deeply interested in your happiness—and has confidence in your sincerity—and who, if he ask a rude or abrupt question, must be charitably supposed to have a good reason for it—in one word, then—are you not soon to be married?” Elvira bowed. “I thank you,” said Oscar. “From my soul I thank you! This is what I expected from you. I am now satisfied. Remember my words. Beware of your intended husband. Be not precipitate. It is enough, I hope, for me to say, that he is unworthy of you.” “Sir!”—said Elvira, somewhat haughtily. “Yes, lady—I have not forgotten you, nor myself. You may not believe me now, but when I am gone, you will. You have no brother, no friend, to inquire into the mysteries of that man's character. I have been occupied, day and night, for three months. I am satisfied, in my own mind, that he is a—No matter—I would not unnecessarily wound you, Elvi—lady,—I beg your pardon.” “Where are your proofs?” said I. “I have none to offer. But you know me. My word ought to be taken. I have satisfied my own heart; and all I ask is, that you take a little more time, before you—I cannot speak it—lady, you must not marry him—you shall not. I will strangle him with my own hands first!—Nay—I am not to avail myself of this advice—you shall not be thwarted, in any plan of happiness by my presence. I shall depart, in another hour, for the continent. May I ask when the marriage was to have taken place?” “I shall deal plainly, fearlessly with you, sir,” said Elvira. “We shall be married, I believe, immediately.” “Immediately!”—echoed he—“are you so impatient?” Elvira coloured to the eyes;—and she arose. “One week,” said he—“only one week—and I will never trouble you again.” “Impossible,” said she—“the time is fixed.” “Well, then,” said Oscar—“then I must strike home. I cannot help it. The fault is not mine. I would spare you—but I cannot. I would save you—and there is only one way. Your lover is a married man.” “It is false!—on my life and soul, it is false—thou evil minded man!”—answered Elvira. “Lady—dare you tell Oscar Salisbury—dare you— after all that you know of him—that what he says is false! I am sorry—I had hoped other things of the woman that I once—but no matter—it is time to end this conference. You will find, in these papers, the proof that Ortley is a married man—that he is no other than Sir Charles Larence himself—and that the woman whom he betrayed, is now in a madhouse—and the poor innocent girl, who last doated on him, in her grave. Yes— with her babe at her bosom—broken hearted—and dead.” I looked at Elvira. Was she death-struck? She betrayed no emotion—no distress. Her utter lifelessness was followed by a hasty quivering of the lip, and she raised her delicate hand to her forehead—and parted her damp hair—as if the chills of the sepulchre were upon it;—but still she spoke not:—she was pale, deathly pale. A horse dashed by the window!—She turned her head, and shrieked. The next moment the door was burst open, and Ortley entered the room—but he encountered the awful rebuke of Oscar, and fell back. Oscar turned to me—“Are the ten minutes expired?” said he. “No, sir.” “You interrupt us,” said he, turning to Ortley— “Will you leave the room?” “Yes—if you will accompany me.” “With all my heart!” was Oscar's reply;—but Elvira threw herself between them, exclaiming—“O, no, no, in mercy! do not go!” “Lady,” said Oscar—“I am determined—Mr. Ortley seems to hesitate—he has his reasons undoubtedly. I have a duty to perform—a religious one. It is possible that I have done a fellow creature injustice. I shall not live long—and it would be well to make all the atonement in my power, while I can.” I was struck with the solemnity of his tone. There was no passion in it, and Elvira seemed to regard it as propitious. “Will you walk on the terrace, gentlemen?” said I, thinking the place far enough off for conversation, and so near that they would not quarrel there. “Both took their hats. Oscar was the first to the door—he turned a moment, and I observed the scornful writhing of his lip, as his eye passed Ortley; and its blackening, melancholy, effulgent beauty, when it dwelt upon Elvira. He hesitated—something was at his heart —he looked like one that cannot die in peace, till he has uttered some secret. “Lady!” said he, in a low voice—O, I never shall forget it—it was so unearthly, so inward, so touching!— “Lady—we never meet again. I shall haunt you no more. We have been friends. May we not be so yet? You have done, and I have done, what, perhaps, we may wish undone—even in this world—farewell”—(he extended his hand—majestically—but tenderly)—“for the last time—farewell!” Who could refuse him? She gave him her hand. He held it for a moment, and looked her in the face—her eyes filled—“Elvira! Elvira—the past is over—may the future comfort thee!—Heaven bless thee!” He was gone—and ere the light shone into the door again, through which he passed—Elvira was stretched upon the floor, utterly insensible—and lifeless. We heard their steps, a few moments afterward, upon the terrace. Their conversation was loud, at intervals, and angry, and continued so long, that Elvira recovered, and went to her room. I remained at the window, ready to interfere, if occasion required it, and determined not to permit the marriage, until I was satisfied respecting Mr. Ortley: for I knew Oscar too well, to believe that what he said, was said upon slight evidence. I was startled by a shriek—and the next moment, a violent scuffle, in the room over my head—the very room that you now occupy. I ran up, and as I entered, I heard the words villain! coward! and saw Oscar dash Ortley against the wall, as if he were a child—the collar of Oscar was torn open—and Ortley held a sword, broken at the hilt, in his hand—another lay upon the floor. All this I remembered afterward, as the first appearance of the room:—just as I approached, Ortley broke loose from *20 Oscar, caught up the broken blade—which Oscar wrenched from him, at the moment that Elvira rushed between them—unhappy woman!—Oscar drove it through and through the side of Ortley—and wounded Elvira herself —they fell together, and their blood mingled. Ortley never spoke again—he had barely life enough to press his hands together, and turn his lips toward Elvira, as he saw her, with her shut eyes, sinking at his side. “The room was immediately cleared. Oscar stood like one, suddenly turned to stone. Elvira was taken away— and the body of Ortley, with the blood oozing from his side, and plashing, thickly and heavily, upon the floor, drop after drop—was laid upon a table, before which Oscar stood, with his hands smoking. He was motionless —even his eyes were so—his brow was knitted—his arms folded—and his tremendous countenance, under his luxuriant and disordered hair, was unearthly—he stood like some minister of the Most High—commissioned to do such deeds. Yea—there he stood!—speechless—motionless—as if the blood and horrour about, were matters of little moment to him. “I meant to commit him to custody. I motioned to him to follow me, therefore, as I left the room. But it was in vain—and, as he then stood, I do believe that no human force could have moved him—but at the peril of annihilation. I left him, therefore, doubly locking the door—and barring every chance of communication— leaving him, face to face, with the dead body—the floor stained with blood, that stood upon it in puddles—the light scarlet foam whizzing upon the dark surface—(as if blood that was so spilt, could not stagnate,) long after it had settled—and the white curtains bleeding, drop after drop, from the first spurting of the wound—when Oscar drew out the broken sword, as Ortley fell. “As I left the room, Oscar took hold of the dead man's hand, and placed his own palm, bloody as it was, upon the ghastly eyes before him, as if they were alive— Never shall I forget the expression of his face, as he did so. It was awful indeed!—Yet he did it calmly—very calmly. “All that night, he remained alone, in the pale starlight, sitting by the side of the body, and watching the horrible eyes—swollen, and blood shot. Not a step was heard in the apartment—not a groan. Toward morning, however, I was told that he had struck a light, and was writing. “In the morning, he was gone—how, or by what means, we know not. We found the door fastened within, and I ordered it to be burst open—Harold!—imagine for yourself, my horrour—a lamp was glimmering feebly from the mantlepiece—and we saw a naked man, sitting upon a white sheet—it was soaked through with blood!— and a part of it, stiffened and compressed, adhered to his side, as if it had been thrust into the wound—the eyes were open and staring—the lids imprinted with the touch of bloody fingers—and the pale—pale lips—drawn upward from the bare teeth—Oh!!—it was horrible. My brain whirled—and it was long before I could go near enough, to become assured that it was not Oscar himself! But when I found what it was—the dead body so awfully arrayed, as in mockery—then the dreadful thought flashed itself, all at once, over my brain—my blood froze—my bones rattled—my very heart seemed to shrivel and wither, as I looked. I was then sure that Oscar had gone mad under the trial—that I had subjected him to.—I!— “Was Oscar a shedder of blood? Then what was I? Had I not wrecked his noble brain—forever and ever!— O, Harold, the desolation, the convulsive blackness that descended upon me, as I thought of it, is inconceivable. I felt as if I were the murderer—I alone. “We found these few lines upon the table.” Here Mr. Hammond took out a paper, and read as follows: “I am beyond your reach—the commission is executed. I have set in judgment upon him. Take him—bury him— his soul is now shivering over the green turf, where she —the betrayed—the innocent—the beautiful—the dead —is mouldering. This is written in blood—his blood —his blood—his heart's blood. “They, the innocent, are at rest. The avenger of blood hath been abroad—go to his presence chamber— there you will find his victim. Give him to the surgeons —the wolves—the worms. I care not. “Pursue me—it is in vain. I go, commissioned by God, to lay waste and desolate the habitations of men. I have touched the pestilence, and it awoke—I have summoned the strong wind, and the earthquake—and lo! they are on the wing! “Is she dead? My hand erred. Poor Elvira—I could weep for thee. Thou wast very dear to me. It was he only, that I was to bid to the carousal of the night—the festival of the charnel house:—not she. If she come—she comes an unbidden guest. But I will be by her—no skulls shall mock at her—no bony hand profane her lips—no socketless eyes—damnation!—the king of terrours himself shall not approach her! Bid her be tranquil. I will be there. Stay—she is here—” “—Well. All is settled now. I am ready. She has left me for a few hours. She does not complain— poor, dear Elvira—how could I help weeping!—No, she says she does not, cannot, for she fell by my hand. Was there ever such love! such consummate love and tenderness! “I have watched by the dead body. I was troubled, for a season, with its ghastly and distorted lineaments. I was even in doubt, for a moment, whether I was really the minister of God. I asked myself if he were guilty?— An angel—full of terrible beauty, stood by me—arise! said he, to the dead body—arise! It obeyed. Unveil thyself! heart and soul! Stand there naked before me! The corpse arose, and the clothes fell from it, into dust and ashes, as you will perceive. I read his heart—and I have left it, that you may read it! Read it, and be wise. “Did you hear the thunder? Did you tremble? I did not—no—though my hands were smoking with the sacrifice—no! Not even when I saw a multitude of pale, naked men—belike that had been murdered—moving about in the sky—constantly emerging and disappearing, in the darkness—like shapes seen in a deep, deep cavern. No!—Not even when I heard the voice of Elvira in the wind, calling out to me, as she passed. No!—not when the blue lightning hissed by me—and I saw the room swimming in blood—and the whole air was a hot steam —and all about me were shattered hearts, and rivetted eyes—and dishevelled hair. Nay,—not even when a horrible portent thundered by me—and the sky, for a moment, turned red—and a great steed dashed over the firmament—in smoke and flame—with a rider, naked and shrieking—urging him onward—who was the rider?—it was myself!—The reins were loose in his hands—and the blood fell like rain from the flanks of his charger. But why should I tremble?—Am I not the minister of the Almighty?—Am I not! “The dagger I leave upon the table. I pray you, let it abide there. You had better not touch it. He that touches, it shall die by it. It is written. Bye and bye, when you least expect me, I shall return.” Such was his letter. It confirmed all my apprehensions. We scoured the whole country, but could hear no tidings whatever of him. At last he returned—and his presence was like a clap of thunder. We had not the strength to lay hands upon him. He went and came, unmolested, like some angel of darkness. But the country, far and near, was agitated. By some strange fortune he continued ignorant of Elvira's fate; and, I believe, thought her dead, to the last hour of his life. A thousand marvellous stories were invented, circulated and believed. Oscar surrendered himself to justice, in silence. He spake not—moved not—when they ironed him—but there was an appalling calmness in his manner, that awed his oppressor. I went to see him in his dungeon. “Do you know,” said he to me, after a silence of a full hour—“do you know that there (pointing to a dark part of his cell—) there! is the dead body of Ortley?” I shuddered. “It is near bed time,” said he, in the same tone, without lifting his eyes—“He sleeps with me to night. To-morrow night I sleep with him—He is a cold bed fellow. Did you ever see him after that night? —Ortley!—Ortley!—come out into the light!— come!—” I trembled in every joint—had the grave opened at my feet, I should not have been more terrified—nay, while I looked into the darkness, I almost fancied that I could see him—Ortley—himself, sitting as I last saw him, upon a white sheet.— “There!—” continued Oscar—“Is he much altered? That is just as he appeared to me, the first night. Just so pale—so deadly pale—Ortley! this is the last night —there, there—that is near enough. There is something, is'nt there, in his dark matted hair, and wild eye —what—gone!—gone, so soon!— * * * “No matter—He arose last night,—it was the third time—he was sitting there, —just where you are—ha! ha! ha!—what! are you alarmed!—poor fool—he cannot touch you. Do you see that wall—there, where I am pointing? He walked directly through it—and laid himself down there—just where you saw him when you came in. Ha!—what are you crying about?—are you a relation of Ortley's? —his father perhaps—well, well, I am sorry for it. He was a murderer, he stabbed a man—who?—why Oscar Salisbury—hear him! the bloody wretch—he is laughing at us!—ha! ha! ha!—Do you know his laugh? That's he. “And so, and so-I thought that he was alone, and I went to him. I was mistaken, there was a woman with him. The blood was crusted upon his side—his grave clothes were black with it—she leant over him, and wept. The blood flowed again—and bubbled all round the room, was that right?—I have protested against it. I called to the officer—I pointed them out—I spoke to him of the impropriety of such things—threatened him—and demanded another room. I will not be disturbed in this way. I cannot sleep. But he is bribed—I am sure of it. Is'nt it shameful:—every night—if it were one night, or two, I should not mind it, but every night, to have him let in—and then he comes, and lies down by me—and he is so cold—indeed it is very disagreeable. I wish that you would interfer. It would be very kind in you. They wo'nt heed me—and a little mercy of this sort, that I may have one night's sleep—before I die. But he won't lie down—if he would only lie down, I could bear it better—but there he comes, and—all naked as he is—cold as death, too—he sits up in the bed all night long, and looks me, all the while, in the face.—Indeed it is hard to bear—.” “What—ha!—Begone Sir!—this is a publick prison —this is my apartment!—I will not be intruded upon —!what, were you not decently buried?—There's money for you—begone!—” “—It was midnight, black, thick midnight, when he first came in—I awoke and found him sitting by my side—it was very dark—but—and I shut my eyes—but I could see him nevertheless, through my eyelids and fingers. Nay—dont go yet. Elvira will be here at twelve. Did you ever see Elvira, she is very beautiful—pale—remarkably pale—but oh, such eyes—!— who is that sobbing!—Ortley—Elvira—appear!— Hark!—that is she—I know her step—.” I was overcome—I fell upon my face. He lifted me up—appeared bewildered, and the first thing that I recollect was, that his face was close to mine, and he was feeling it, with an air of strange perplexity. “Begone,” said he, at last—“begone!—(in a voice of thunder—) I know you! You are Oscar. Begone this instant, or I will tear thee limb from limb—Begone!—” “What could I do? I left him. His trial came on. He was arraigned in spite of all my interference, and his madness, his incurable madness was mistaken for melancholy. He pleaded guilty, in a gentle, firm voice. And he would have been condemned; an everlasting reproach to our laws, and to humanity, notwithstanding my testimony, for I was the only one that had seen him at night, and he was rational at all other hours, and on all other subjects but these. “The jury found him guilty. He made no defence. He was brought up for judgment. We were awestruck by the dark sublimity of his countenance. “Stop!” said he, to the judge, with an air of authority, as he began to sentence him. “Stop! my time is not yet come. I retract my plea. The charge is murder. I deny it. I am not guilty. I am willing to die, I desire to die. I care not how, nor when—the sooner the better—for I am weary of living. But—I will not die as a murderer. I slew him—I confess that—but why?—at the command of the Everlasting God!—You are terrified—you quake upon the bench—I do not wonder at it—light your candles—bar your doors—and sit here till midnight, if you dare. He shall stand before you—he!—and bear testimony to my innocence. Look at me!—see these hands—these fetters—if I but touch them, they crumble and dissolve in vapour—there!— where are they now!—do you doubt me now! Am I not free now! Who hath done this?—the Almighty. Man!—man!—I tell thee, that there are other hands at work in the darkness. Woe to thee, and to all that lay theirs upon me or mine!” “What could be done? He was silent. And the court remanded him to prison; but not to the same; their humanity appointed to him a more light and pleasant apartment. Yet, he grew worse—daily—hourly worse. At last, a fire broke out in the prison, and—he saved a woman's life, instinctively—and the torch of reason touched by humanity, blazed up all at once, with a sudden and beautiful lustre. I saw him—he had been reduced to a skeleton. The sunken eye, the bony cheek and forehead —the blueish lip—the hoarse, unusual, inarticulate utterance, and the difficult breathing, with the foam that collected on his lips, which he had not the strength to wipe off, all showed that he was near his dissolution. I took his hand—and, fearful of distressing him, was silent. “Hammond” said he—“I am glad that you are come. I am going—going, all dead here! (he added, raising his feeble hands, with a patient, slow motion, singularly expressive of a mortal decay about the region of vitality—and passing them over his chest)—all dead—all dead here!” “I wondered at his composure. In time, however, the weakest become familiar with death; and learn to contemplate his tremendous features unmoved. And why not? The strong—it is they, who are likely to die hard. They know it. Their thread of life is broken—that of the weak untwisted. But the weak are not such men as Oscar—so impatient—soaring—heroick and terrible— no!—and I wondered at his meekness, tranquillity, and steadiness. What was the cause?—He had made his peace with God! His eyes showed it;—his soul—like a forgiven spirit—purified and weeping, was in them. He was willing to die—willing to live—had no hope—and believed that every breathing of his heart was numbered. “I was inexpressibly affected. I wept and prayed with him, midnight came. He desired to be raised in the bed—he was suffocating—and the thick phlegm upon his mouth was only to be wiped away by the hand of another. He had not the strength to lift his own. I heard a sudden, increasing, dry, convulsive rattle—and then all was silent, and his eyes were fixed. “Judge of my feeling—I was alone. It was midnight. At this instant, thought I—his spirit is standing before the judgment seat, and lo, I am the only witness. But now, he was here—and now—where is he? “Harold—I have been in many trying situations— many of peril and death; but never was I so completely overcome, so utterly dismayed and prostrate, as at that moment; nothing could have affected me more, I am sure —except my own arraignment, at the last day. Vol. II. 21 “I thought that it was all over with him—and was just leaving the room, when I fancied that I saw a slight motion of the linen, over his chest, in the pale light. I was not deceived. He was in a trance. He recovered —yea—after all this, he recovered. He came abroad— demanded another trial—and was triumphantly acquitted. The Court was crouded beyond example. His deportment was noble and affecting. His voice was thrilling and solemn. There was not a dry eye about him. His alone, was sad—calm—and deeply beautiful. “`I thank the court,' said he. `Gentlemen of the jury, I thank you. To my counsel too, I owe much acknowledgment, and to the audience for their sympathy and indulgence. But, I am not satisfied. The verdict was wrong—the evidence wrong. I was the aggressor; not a murderer, it is very true, but the first blow was mine. He attempted to stab me. Such is the fact. I deserved some punishment—perhaps a worse than that appointed for manslaughter. I have received it—and withstood it. My lords, I have been closeted every night—in imagination—with the dead body—but I am getting unintelligible—' “The Court shed tears—” The attention of Harold was here suddenly arrested by a shot, which wounded Mr. Hammond's horse—and, the next moment, three ruffians dashed through the hedge, and planted themselves before Harold—but Mr. Hammond, carried off by the wounded horse, which he was unable to arrest, was instantly beyond their reach. A blunderbuss was levelled, and discharged after him—but Harold had the satisfaction to see that it was without any effect— The foremost presented a pistol—“Deliver! Sir,” said he, and the others prepared to second his demand. “Stop Sir!” said Harold: and put his hand very leisurely into his bosom. One of the robbers saw the motion, and would have brought him down with his pistol on the spot, had not his companion, struck with the singular steadiness of Harold's youthful countenance, interfered at the instant. “Young men,” he continued, “your object is money. I have but a trifle, and before I give up that, I will state the case to you. It may save bloodshed. All my money is ten guineas. Now, I will not part with one sixpence in this way, while there is breath in my body.” “Damn him—down with him!” answered one. “No, no!—Tom—no, no, he's game—give him fair play,” said another. Harold continued, unmoved—ready to dismount, at a moment's warning, and preparing for a mortal conflict, as he went on—“If you rob me, you must kill me—and I will promise you to take, at least, one of your number along with me—do your best. In that case you will lose one life, and commit a murder for ten guineas. Can you afford to do this! Are you prepared to take your chance? I am. Besides—I ought to inform you, that if you kill me, you will as surely be hanged, all that survive, as you are now standing there; and if you attempt it, and do not kill me, I will never rest—never!—till I have brought you to justice.” As he uttered these words—he stood suddenly upon his feet, before them! with a pistol in his hand—and his horse was thundering along the high road. The fellow with the pistol was so startled, that it went off on the spot, without injury or aim. Harold smiled. “You see,” said he, “in what an unprofitable affair you have engaged. My horse will alarm the whole country the way that he has gone—and my friend, the other way. Before you could bless yourself, you perceive, that I could have stretched one of you at my feet—and then, I am pretty sure, that I should have given a good account of one, if not of both the other two, before mortal aid could interfere. But I forebore. You are all young—all!—and I pity you. What say you? Will you have the money?” “Go to the devil with your money!”—said the first ruffian, laughing in spite of himself, and turning to go off. “Give him a slug, Bob—one, Bob—just to remember you by”—said the other. “Curse me, if I do,” said Bob—“he's no chicken. I like him—though, blast my eyes, if I feel safe with him —let us be off.” “My honest fellow”—said the first, amazed at Harold's composure, “you must be damned poor—will a few guineas be of any service to you? By your appearance, you seem to be a gentleman—but then, damme, gentlemen don't play such games. Are you mad—a little— or may be—I beg your pardon—may be, you follow the road yourself? Give us your hand.” “Begone!” said Harold—sternly. “I'll tell you what it is, Mr.”—said the robber, (leisurely knocking the powder into the pan, and looking at the flint)—“you had better give fair words. My notion is, that you are a play actor—or a little damaged in the upper story—what say you?—but if I thought that you really knew better, and meant to be saucy—curse me, if I would'nt slash your weazen for you, before you could say Jack Robinson.” “Do—if you are disposed,”—was Harold's reply. “Come along!” cried his companion—“damn the fellow—he is some poet—come along—and leave him to his rehearsals!” The man stared—“By the Lord, you are right, Billy,” said he, “I never thought of that!—So, sir—Mr. Poet— I wish you a pleasant walk, after your horse—Good morning, sir!” Harold could not, for his soul, help laughing: there was somewhat so irresistibly droll in the profound bow, with which the fellow, after staring at him for a second or two, took his leave. They disappeared across the country, and Harold pursued his way with his pistol in his hand, till, in the mere listlessness of his mind, he happened to look into the pan —there was no powder in it! He examined it—it was not loaded! Gracious Heaven! What an escape! Thus is it with genuine courage. The stoutest heart is intimidated, when, in its guilt, it encounters a man in the full possession of his faculties. He was aroused from the revery, by hearing the hoofs of a horse, approaching at full speed. He looked about, and had the pleasure of seeing his own, with a peasant upon it, armed;—as he approached, he presented his pistol to Harold—and it was some minutes before each was satisfied that the other was not a highwayman. At last, however, they succeeded in explaining themselves; and Harold mounted, and continued walking on until they heard the quick report of fire arms, at a great distance, in the direction which Mr. Hammond had fled in, as Harold thought, with much joy, yet some little indignation, for he did not then know that the horse was wounded. Harold threw away his pistol—caught that of the farmer out of his hand, and put his horse to full speed, telling him to follow as he could. At the very next turn he encountered a carriage and four—but one of the leaders was wounded, and fell just as Harold appeared:—he heard a continual shriek, and seeing a man, at a distance, engaged with two others, he rode to his relief. As he approached, he was recognised—and all hands turned upon him—he brought one man down—but his horse fell—and had he not caught the sword that was raised to thrust him through, while he was entangled in the stirrups—and the ruffian was afraid to approach too near the struggling horse—with his hand, at the expense of being cut through sinew and bone almost—he would have been killed upon the spot. But the sword once in his hand, even by the blade, it was his forever!—he tore it away, and giving the wretches no time to load their pistols, he dealt about his blows, with such effect, that he stretched a second at his feet, in the twinkling of an eye —the other flung his broken rapier at Harold's head, with a hearty curse, for a poet, and scampered over the fields. Harold attempted to pursue him—but he was too weak—he was wounded—and yet he had never felt the *21 weapon, nor knew when or how it happened. He fainted —and when he came to his senses, all traces of the past were obliterated. He was in a strange room—and the voice of a child only was heard, whispering its musick, in a tone that thrilled into his heart, on the far side of the room. Harold drew the curtains, gently, and just so as to peep through. Where was he? The room was beautifully neat—decorated with exquisite little paintings, and full of fragrant plants, and sweet flowers. “Another! and another!” said some female in a faint voice—as if in prayer. He looked out through the curtains, in another direction, and saw Caroline, with her hands raised—and her fine eyes, full of solemnity and tenderness, lifted with a disconsolate, and yet touching, expression to Heaven. Yes! there she was, in all her innocence and loveliness! She arose, and he fell back upon his pillow, and shut his eyes, willing to enjoy a little longer, the luxury of his situation. She approached—drew the curtain—and leaned over him. He felt her gentle breath stirring his hair—her patient, soft, delicate hand, touching, quietly and tenderly, along his brow—so caressingly—so affectionately—that he caught it to his lips! Caroline almost shrieked—but she had just command enough of herself to suppress the cry, and a sweet, terrified murmur of mingled agitation and delight, only escaped her. She saw his eyes—he opened them with a smile— “Dear, dear Caroline”—said Harold; and Caroline, already overcome with her emotion, then lost all command of herself, and fell upon his bosom, and sobbed aloud. This was the second time that Harold had been called upon, for all that was touching and thankful in his nature—the second time, that his hot forehead, and dry lips had been ministered to, by that creature, so tenderly fashioned and fitted by our Father, in mercy to our infirmities, for our consolation in a cold world:—the second time, that gentle eyes and affectionate lips had been near him, when he was alone;—so patiently waiting on him—so affectionately soothing him;—that the very touch of her dear hand was a relief to his aching temples— and her tears, when they fell, like the dew from an angel's wing upon a sore and agitated heart, were soothing and healthful to him. O woman!—it is only at that hour, when the cold world rolls away from us—when the golden pageantry of life wanes and darkens—when a desolation is about us, and they that have loved us— love us no more—when Sorrow is at her incantations, and Melancholy is already chisselling an epitaph for our broken heart—O, it is only then that woman is truly known! That is her hour of light—when all the world is dark to us. That is her time of gentleness and tears, when we are forgotten by all else, and the rude sound of the world's hilarity breaks through the shut curtains of our bed—and rings about our darkened chamber, like unhallowed mockery. It is then, that her soft foot falls, like the innocent tread of a naked angel; it is then that all sound from her lips—and all motion from her beauty, is melody, tender, mournful and weeping—O woman! rather than not know and experience thy consummate value, in the tender offices of the sick chamber, —rather than never see thee, about it, like a spirit on tiptoe, bearing health in thy delicate hand, and compassion in thy pure eyes—I would consent to inhabit and dwell, forever and ever, within the chambers of pestilence and death! I would, indeed! “And do you know me, Harold—my brother!” “Know thee love!—O Caroline! wert thou near my ashes, they would testify their sensibility to thy presence, I am sure!—wert thou to pass near them, though the green turf oppessed me, there would be a commotion beneath it!—In my dreaming dear, my heart hath kept time to thy voice, involuntarily, like our fingers to sweet musick! Know thee my sister—O yes—thy timid mouth has been near me, I am sure, during my delirium, for I feel pleasantly about the lips and eyelids—thy bashful cherishing I have felt—and thy lovely arm hath embraced me, I am sure, Caroline, while all my senses, but the sense of thee, had departed, for I feel happy, so happy, that I cannot express what I feel, about the region of the heart. Know thee, Caroline! thee! whom to hold affinity with, is to be nearer heaven—thee! my blood's idol! thee! for whom any martyrdom were sweet!—O Caroline, I have felt thy presence insinuating itself like a subtle fluid, while I slept, into all the unlighted, unheathful, and unholy chambers of my soul—like some blessed spirit, that bears light, and air, and incense, in her look and breathing—before whom Impurity veils her form—and Voluptuousness prostrates herself, supplicating to be annihilated or redeemed, as she passes by the place of their dwelling.” Caroline wept with delight and tenderness—and was only recalled to herself, by a little creature, that plucked impatiently at her frock— “Mamma is come!” said the child, in accents, that sent the blood, with the velocity of light, through all his arteries.— It was Leopold! My child! Harold faintly articulated, as he put out his then wasted arms to embrace him—“my child!” Leopold leaped into them—and Harold, hearing some movement near, had just turned his eyes in the direction, when the boy whispered softly in his ear—“You are Mr. Salisbury now, you know—I must not call you pa —no more—no more—I dont love it—do you?—I wish she would let me call you pa.—” A presence that he knew, here put forth her hand, with a melancholy smile and sore confusion—the deep concern of her eyes trembling, in their depth, as to arrest the prattler—but he eluded her touch, and crept under the bed clothes, laughing aloud—and talking as fast as he could talk, all the while.— Caroline was inconceivably distressed—was it that she had any, the slightest suspicion of the fact?—It were difficult to tell. But her agitation became extreme, when Leopold, peeped out, and promised to be a good boy, only on one condition—that he might call “papa—his pa—and why not?” said he, “he is my pa—nurse says he is—and Miss Caroline says I am his picture—is I his picture, ma?” Harold was obliged to interfere—“Leopold!” said he, in a voice, at which, the moment it was heard, the little fellow looked up in his face a moment, with eyes running over, to see if he were in earnest—and then crept to his bosom—burried his little face, and sobbed aloud.— But nothing would do—He was not to be trusted; and the amazing resemblance between Harold and the boy was becoming every day more and more alarming. Lady Elvira was like a guilty thing, and had, till the sickness of Harold was extreme, kept the child away, and only then took him with her, as she came herself to reside with Caroline, because she apprehended no indiscretion in Harold, and was known to be so passionately fond of the boy, that if she left him behind, it would appear more extraordinary than if she brought him. Leopold was taken away. It was fatal to him—he pined and wasted—and when Harold next saw him, he was so pale, so thin, and his innocent eyes were so hidden, under their meek waxen lids, that he shuddered, and the tears fell upon his little mouth, while he clung to him, as if his heart were breaking. He was upon his mother's lap—and as Harold leaned down to embrace him, his cheek touched her hand. The touch was like electricity: he lifted his eyes, and saw hers so deeply, passionately, darkly expressive of her thought, that he blushed and trembled like a young girl. But Leopold was deadly sick—he had some symptoms of a disorder that they knew too little of, to be alarmed about—the croup. The boy was well, and in remarkable spirits, save that he looked thin and pale, at sunset the evening before; but he was now so altered for the worse, that they were terrified. Harold loved the boy—doated on it. Elvira too, she was distractedly fond of it—but, their suffering was not yet at an end. Leopold grew worse—his mother could no longer support his weight, and he was put to bed. Harold approached, softly, a moment after, that he might be near the helpless, endearing little creature; but was shocked at the change in his countenance. Was it death struck!—Merciful Heaven!—can a cold be so perilous? And now came the bitterest thought—the physician was again sent for—“Did you give him the powders?” said he, anxiously, as his eye fell upon the child's face—“No—sir”—said Elvira, watching him, while he removed the lamp, with a trembling hand, as if to see if the death-like hue were not owing to that—“we did not think it necessary—we were unwilling to distress him” “What!” cried the good man, in evident terrour—while his eyes grew dim—“You have not—Lady—(his voice faltered—he could not proceed)—and Elvira's attention was called off to the child, who exclaimed in a broken voice, while his little blue lips trembled with a faint smile— “O, ma!—my ma!—I do love you, ma!—I can't see you, ma!—where are you?—O, how dark it grows.” This was too much. The appearance of the physician— his tears—his voice—all was explained now—it flashed like a thunderbolt upon her brain—she fell upon her knees and wrung her hands—“O, my God! my God! I have murdered my child!—O save him, save him!—Merciful God!”—and swooned upon the spot. Harold staggered to her assistance—but he had only the strength to raise her drooping head upon his knees— while the hoarse breathing of the child, became every moment, more distressingly audible. But why prolong the detail!—The babe died!—died before his eyes!— Ye that have had children—ye that have seen the dear, helpless, beautiful expression of their dying eyes—to your memory I leave it!—I cannot go on—I cannot!— His sweet, violet pupils, dewy and dim—there they are yet!—O, my child! my child!—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. Men are most anxious to appear what they are not. We care little for what we have; but we are covetous of all else. Thus, we learn to affect that which we are most desirous of being: and affectation soon becomes habit. But when the trick is discovered, ashamed of our own folly, we affect to be unaffected, and live and die in a state of perpetual vascillation, between what we are, and what we would be. Thus a man of sound judgment, without one grain of imagination, shall dabble in poetry, to the neglect of all useful science. And the man of imagination, without one ounce of practical good sense, will be breaking his neck after the mathematicks. A chicken-spirited, mild, amiable man, will sometimes affect to be very implacable and bloodthirsty; while he who really hath a devil, will affect kindness and benignity. An impudent dog will remember, and dwell with emphasis, upon the proof of his modesty and backwardness; while he who is really bashful, is forever telling you how fearless and saucy he has been, on this and that occasion. Thus, our whole lives are spent; and it is a good rule of judgment to set that man down for not being, at heart, that which he appears most desirous of being thought. So with our hero—While he was wild, as the unharnessed colt of the desert, he was perpetually struggling with himself, and concealing it. But now, as his disposition softened, and newer, milder and more beautiful visions passed before him; his chief occupation lay, in persuading himself, (and others indirectly,) that he was the same unbroken, irresistible and triumphant savage that he had once been. Nay, he succeeded in vindicating himself, to himself, from the alleged degeneracy that his conscience sometimes charged him with. “I have come,” said Mr. Hammond, entering the room one morning briskly, “to inform you that you can now write directly to M. De Vandreuil, at Paris—he is there!” Harold turned pale—“A French nobleman, the lover of the lady whom you so gallantly protected the other day (alluding to the robbery) is going to France immediately and will undertake to deliver any thing you please, into the hands of the Count himself.” “God bless him for it!”—said Harold, shivering from head to foot—“It is so long—Gracious Heaven—I know not what to think or say—yes—I will write.—” His eyes filled—he embraced Mr. Hammond—he wrung his hand—he appeared for a moment delirious— to the utter astonishment of the good man—with the effect of this intelligence. He ran to his chamber—fell upon his knees—softened with recent calamity—the tenderness of the past rose like a fountain in his heart, and bubbled through all his veins. He saw the green leaves dancing again over his head— and the transparent water rushing away, beneath his feet, and the beautiful dark, shady wilderness all about him. “Oh, Loena! Loena!” he cried—“thou unspeakably dear one!—I shall—I shall!—I shall be near thee again!—hear the wild musick of thy voice—and then— Oh lay me in my grave! I shall have lived long enough!” VOL. II. 22 After pacing his chamber till his agitation had, in a great measure, subsided, he began a letter to De Vaudreuil, in the following words: My Benefactor! I have this moment heard that you are in Paris; and am all in a trepidation with the thought. What shall I say to you, you who were my first and best friend? Shall I come and throw myself into your arms, at once, and there tell you, my father! for so you have commanded me to call you, all that has happened to me? But I cannot—there is a reason—or at least, I hope that there is, and believe that there is—if I did not, I should go distracted—which forbids my visiting you, before I hear from you. You have, undoubtedly, heard of my capture; and you have had the charity, I am sure, to believe that I have written you a hundred letters since. But they could not reach you—they have all gone to Quebec, as they could, by cartels, &amp;c. &amp;c. But that you may know all that I have experienced, and who I am, and what, I am about to repeat the whole story again.' (Here he recapitulated all his adventures—and then continued as follows:) `Are you not gratified, my dear count, my father! Yes, you are. I see your eyes glisten as you read it. If—there is a dreadful subject for me to approach— can you not imagine all that I would say—? If—oh, no, I cannot suppose such a thing—she is alive, she is!—I am sure of it—Give her the enclosed—do, my dear count. `Can she write yet?—poor Loe—no, I cannot write her name. Remember me, affectionately, to my lady— and the whole family—tell them that a son and a brother, who is not entirely unworthy of their love, will never forget them. Let them use their influence that she may write me. I so long to look upon some of her thought, traced with a beating heart—but I cannot go on— `If she cannot write yet—why then, I hardly know what to say about the enclosed. I would not have any mortal eye see it except hers—no, not even yours. So —whether she can read it or not, now, give it to her, and let her keep it until she can. In that case, you will not forget to inform me of every thing. Heaven bless you! I would write more, but I cannot, for I remember that the sooner this is on its way, the sooner I shall receive an answer.' The enclosure was expressed in this manner: `Dear Loena—(but these words were badly erased, and the letter began again)—`I would not again intrude upon your presence, dearest of women, if I did not feel that, with all my faults, I am not so utterly unworthy of you, as you have believed. Loena, dear Loena, have you forgotten me? If you have—there is only one course left for both of us—it is for you to tell me so, and for me to tear your image from my heart. I have loved you, Loena, God knows how passionately, how truly; and I love you yet—Yea, I shall love you forever and ever. Can you return my love? I ask you a plain question. This is no matter for circumlocution. Will you, can you, forgive and bless me? If yes— behold me at your side, ready to prove, by a life of sincerity and devotion, how unspeakably dear you are to me. If you cannot, I pray you, do not conceal it, do not deceive yourself, or me. It is the last favour that I may ever ask of you, and I ask it by the memory of our former love—by our agony and tears, that you would deal plainly with me. Loena, I am entitled to that, at least. I know not what new laws of etiquette or decorum you may have learned, since we last parted —but, be they what they may, yours was a heart that needed them not; and I do trust that you will, whatever they may say, inform me in so many words—that I have nothing to hope—or, that I am forgiven. `In the meantime, farewell! Do not rashly resolve. I am better, and wiser, than when we parted, and, I do believe, am capable of making you happy. My prayer is that you may believe it. If you do, we shall be happy; but if you do not, it will be your duty to say that you do not, plainly and directly, for by your silence, I shall infer that you have forgiven me. If your letter be no, I shall never trouble you more. Once more farewell! I tremble in writing the word; it may be that I shall never write it again; I hope so, and yet, I cannot lay down my pen. Yet it must be, and I entreat you to remember that this decision of yours will be final. Farewell! farewell!' This letter completed, Harold descended to the parlour, where he found the young nobleman himself; his features were uncommonly expressive and handsome, and Harold could not forbear disclosing the ground of his anxiety. The Frenchman embraced him, and, with tears of thankfulness, poured out his gratitude to Harold, for having saved the life of his dear, dear miss Anna. It was some minutes before Harold was able to comprehend the meaning of these transports; but, at length, with the assistance of Mr. Hammond, he discovered that he had, in the late affair with the highwaymen, probably, saved the life of a very beautiful and intelligent girl, whose friends were ready to die for him in return. This young Frenchman, with that readiness, so characteristick of his age and country, seemed instantly to comprehend the subject of Harold's distress; and after half an hour's conversation, privately with him, departed. That day three weeks he returned. And the sum of his information was this—that De Vaudreuil was dead —his family scattered—some dead, some married, some in Quebec, he having encountered the displeasure of his sovereign, and fallen in a duel at the same time. Of Loena he could only learn that, a young, and singularly beautiful Spanish girl, or Italian as she was thought that had been educated in the count's family, had run off with a young officer named — `Lightning blast him!' cried Harold, when he heard his name, `by the living God, I will never rest till I find him! I will hunt him to the ends of the earth!— See if he escape me again! Why did I spare him before? Why not pursue him, and rend his heart out? This comes of my clemency. And she—she the faithless! the wanton! O, Loena, Loena—farewell! farewell forever. I could have borne all but this—to find thee worthless—thee!—where I had given up my heart— but farewell! farewell!—I am blinded, and sick with the thought—thee!—' The young Frenchman respected his transports, and left him. And Harold, poor Harold, was desolate, heartbroken indeed. This was a calamity, so unforeseen, so unintelligible, that she should have been seduced by one so utterly worthless; one too who had wrestled with her, even at noon day, for her innocence. Could it be! could it! that she could be won, or violated by him! Enough; there was only one route now for Harold—through the storm and darkness forever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. We have now come to a new and trying period in the life of poor Harold. Two whole years have passed away, since we left him, plunged amid the foam and darkness of life's ocean, without one star to shine upon him, as, shipwrecked and shattered in heart, he drifted upon his tempestuous way. Two years have gone, since we left him, leaning upon his hands, the blood of his whole body rushing to his brain—the atmosphere darkening about him, and within him, and his broad eyelids shivering and shutting incessantly, over his mournful eyes, with the excess of his passion. He went abroad, after the shock, but it was like an enchanter; the world was a blank to him, covering the mysterious and hidden dominions where his spirit revelled. He breathed upon it, and it was, as if he had breathed upon a white canvass, and straightway the colour and shape of beauty had arisen, in the vapour of his breath, and passed away again, when that vapour passed away. Many lovely and sweet things, with music, and lustre, and fragrance about them, hovered over the void into which he looked, and haunted him, at a distance. But they would never permit him 22* to approach. If he did, they shut their bright wings, hushed their chanting, and vanished. The strong man had become weak, yet he was formidable, even in his weakness. The creature of vicissitude, for two years, he upheld himself alone, amid the shattered relicks of all that he had leaned upon, and all that he had loved on earth:—trembling and aching with sensibility, his heart, for two years, had been gradually encrusting itself in a panoply of living adamant, of tears and blood:—from the crown of his head, now, even to the sole of his foot, is he invulnerable! His bosom, once the abiding place of ambition; the heart whereon she sat forever, in travail, with portentous dreaming, that heart was now darkened, and quiet, the sanctuary of pure thought and melancholy recollection. The angel of its innermost chamber is now a slumbering child, innocent, and beautiful, as the hallowed light of his own dear eyes. Yes, and the red arm, the ensanguined forehead, and the lofty eye of the young savage—the unsparing and deadly harnessing of his spirit have all passed away. He is a man now, and a christian. Calamity hath tamed him. His proud heart hath been smitten, and the waters of it, like the innermost light of a broken crystal, rushed out and sparkled, with a mournful sound, at the touch that shattered it. He is now—alas! what is he? A sweet solemnity is upon his front; his eyes are full of dark, deep, settled concern—an awful, and abiding steadiness and self-possession are his, now, as of one familiar with holy, and high thought. The burning pathway of passion and excess upon his countenance, hath been obliterated—by whom?—by a gentle, and weeping spirit! one, that stole upon him in his solitude, and with her soft fingers retraced the map of his heart, blotting out the volcano, and illuminating the lonely, and dark place; peopling the solitude, and refreshing the desert. A timid mouth went over his contracted brow, and touched, just touched, his writhing lips, and lo! they relaxed, and smiled, and straightway, were benignant and merciful. He is out upon the hills again, the everlasting hills! and lo! the wilderness beneath his feet. The clouds are in commotion, burning with crimson, and gold, and sapphire; and the far thunder is rolling about, like innumerable drums, through all the circumference of heaven! Hark! the steadfast hills are quaking to the tread of HIS angels! that subterranean echo is the loud presence of the Deity! The clouds are drifting with intelligence and aim! They assemble, and roll upward, barrier over barrier, bridges and arches over flaming voids, like a range of magnificent mountains, parting asunder, all at once—with their rocks, and turrets, and battlements, and precipices, and caverns, and mines, and torrents, all disclosed!—with all their majestick population sitting, and walking about, unconcerned— the cabalistick writing of the divinity, glittering in metallick veins and spots, like the stars of heaven, in deep water; the whole concave above, blue, and boundless, opening like a moonlit cavern.—The architecture of heaven, and all her pillars and constellations shattered, and lying about, like coloured crystal in disorder, and magnificent spectres striding hither, and thither, over the fragments; and the clouds parting, like hills, with harnessed giants standing in the passes! such is the aspect of heaven, at this moment! Harold is in America!—at home! The wide Atlantick is rolling between him, and all his family, and kindred. He is a sceptred hermit. He hath arrived, buckled anew his sword upon his thigh, and gone out to battle, as the Lord's anointed, for the red men of America. He has resworn allegiance to her greatness, and lo! he is now standing up, above the wilderness, under the pictured and animated dome of the temple, that God hath built, for the free in heart; like some high priest, about to offer his sacrifice, to the Everlasting, and Unchangeable.—Every tie of his heart is ruptured. His sister hath gone, blighted, and profaned, to her grave, and blood hath been spilt thereon—blood for tears—drop for drop! Elvira, too— she hath knelt to him, and was scorned! He leaped into his chariot, and flung the loose reins upon the wind, as she, the apparition of beauty, and power, broke out, like a vision, upon his benighted way. Did he pause? No! The Indian girl, too, O, where was she? helpless, broken-hearted, and dying! Over the wide world had he wandered for her, over sea and land, over heaven and earth, in prayer, and in pilgrimage—in vain! in vain! Ah, what accumulated, what consummate treachery and love must she have experienced; the pure and proud of heart, the innocent, the lofty! `Once more, O, our father!' cried Harold, kneeling down, as he stood, barefooted, and bareheaded, where he had first met her—`once more! if it be thy will— and she yet love me, wretched and desolate as she is— O, let me lean once more upon her bosom! once more hear her innocent, quick breathing! once more behold the deep languishing of her eyes, through their beautiful fringe—and then, O, I care not how soon I am bidden to lie down, and die.' Man, man! while thou wast in battle and bloodshed, traversing deserts, she, whom thou didst so love, was crying for thee! Harold threw himself upon the rock, and slept, for the overwatching of his heart could not be appeased by prayer. He dreamt. But still, he was in the wilderness— naked feet were forever passing about him, and dim eyes incessantly glancing under his lashes. And when he stirred, there were voices about him—the wind was harmonious, and pleasant to his lips. A rapt abstraction of the spirit stole over him. He plunged into the mysterious depths of his own heart, and put all the elements thereof in commotion, and brought up the sunken and dimmed pearls and precious things, that Memory had thrown overboard, in the shipwreck of his senses. He was astonished and confounded at their aspect; the inexhaustible and wasted riches of his own nature, upon which Imagination and Enchantment had engraven the sweetest incidents of his life. He attempted to read the characters, but straightway they turned to weeping eyes, and parting lips, and trembling white eyelids, coming, and going, with sweet musical cadence, and pauses of enraptured solemnity, and tenderness — Then brake out upon him, all at once, like a troop of naked, and rejoicing children, all the forbidden and delicate recollections of his love—revisiting the haunted chambers of his imagination—and then, O, the thrilling and delirious fever of such dreams! a sweet face would float by him, in the blue air—wane, and reappear, her meek eyes changing their colour, as they passed him—her soft breath, and rapturous pulsation, so audible! These were his dreams! these! what wonder if he were wasted to a skeleton? An august spirit sat enthroned within his heart, and when her dominions were too fiercely agitated by the rebellion of his thought, she arose, and waved her arm, and all again was peaceful. Out of these trials, there grew an undissembling and obedient submission to his Maker, and Harold took counsel of his meditations, and chose a new faith. In that faith he trod. No obstacle could daunt him; no force could move him; no calamity, no humiliation, no suffering, no menace, could intimidate, or dishearten him. Only one thing could disturb him, now. It was the name of Loena: at that name, his heart shook in his bosom. `What shall I do?' said Harold, as he awoke, on that very spot where he had first loved—a spot, that he had now visited, as something hallowed, and religious. His hands were locked, and the sweat stood upon his lip— `O, woman,' he continued, `even in the solitude, the silent place, yea, even at the home of the altar, the purity of your hearts may be violated, polluted, by the breathing of man!' The thought was suffocation! `That reptile, too, O, that the daughter of Logan should so fall! what shall I do? what can I do? The world is all weariness to me. Ah, if I could find but one, only one kind heart to turn to, at this moment, I might—gracious heaven! what art thou?' A woman was kneeling at his feet, barefooted, like himself, bleeding, her hair falling over her face, and her forehead bowed to the very earth! Harold shivered, with dismay. The apparition raised her head, and Harold covered his face with his hands. `What art thou?' he said, in a hollow voice; `whence? O, Harold, Harold, wilt thou not look upon me?' `Merciful heaven!' he cried, staggering toward her, `where am I? what art thou? I fear to touch thee! and yet, thy voice is the voice of one that I have loved.' `O, bless thee! bless thee! Harold—barefooted and alone, Harold—my master, and my lord! barefooted and alone, have I followed thee! Thou didst spurn me, but I have forgiven thee. Thy proud foot was upon my neck, but I have forgotten it. Thou didst scorn me, and yet Harold, behold me at thy feet! I have followed thee, day after day, night after night, asking only to see thee once more, dear, and die at thy knees! Harold, thou wilt not spurn me again! I cannot leave thee, dear—I cannot—make me, thou man of sorrow, make me, thy handmaid! O, Harold, thou art very dear to me; wilt thou not let me die at thy feet!' What could he do? be fell upon her bosom, and wept —whence came she? from the skies? the clouds? had she emerged suddenly, from the blue water below, or had the mountain given her up? Harold was bewildered—but his prayer—the first that had ever come truly from the deepest place of his heart, had been answered on the spot! He had prayed for one true heart, and lo! it was at his side. He had wished for one that loved him. Here was that one—and O, with what truth and sublimity of devotion, did she love him! She had listened to his delirium and marvelled not— to his chiding, and murmured not; to her, he was all in all, and she, the proudest woman of England, casting aside her rank and authority, lay prostrate, timid, breathless, bowed down, unconditionally, upon the bosom of the Indian boy, under the awful influence of love! Lady Elvira, (it was she,) had returned to America, under the condition of her husband's will. Harold knew not that she was there, and in his wandering he had never heard her name pronounced, thinking of her only as he last saw her, broken hearted, and majestick in her mournful sweetness. And now, to find her here, at his side, so suddenly, so unexpectedly! it was portentous. How happened it? Let only the loving and the loved imagine; them only that haunt the spot forever and ever, sleeping and waking, where their young hearts were first propitiated, had first palpitated together, hallowing every mossy seat, every broken rock, every stump, every fountain, every shadowy place, great tree, and sober wood, with every hue of heaven and earth, with the sanctifying remembrances of affection. O, for the ruptured heart, how melancholy, yet how sweet, to travel o'er again, the green road of its first love, to sit again where she sat, to lean where she leant, and listen where she first learnt to throw down her timid eyelids—Harold the idolater, the profoundest too, of Love, almighty Love, had been lingering awhile, about all this precious scenery, with ten thousand wild, thrilling, mournful emotions; treading, at midnight, the high hill where he had first met Elvira, even while thinking only of Loena, so strangely capricious and unaccountable is the loyalty of the heart. But no matter; there is a treacherous, a subduing tenderness, in revisiting scenery so embalmed by our dear memory; and we are happy to tread it again, even with a stranger. So felt Harold, so Elvira. But the surprise was altogether his. She had seen him before, heard of him, and ordered her presence to be scrupulously kept a secret in America. But at last, in the distracted and sublime veneration of her heart, the unspeakable confidence of a haughty and loving woman, hunting her love even in the solitary place, without fear, or doubt, or apprehension, she had trodden in his footsteps, overtaken him, knelt, wept, and prayed to him. They descended, and were soon within a place of much peril. `What can we do?' cried Harold. `Thou art mine, lady, my first love—no, no, forgive me, forgive me, dear Elvira, not my first love.' They were close together; no living soul near them, in the very room, too, where Harold had stolen upon her slumbers; where—oh shame on him!— `Nay, my beloved,' he continued, as she sat by him, and leant upon his shoulder, `nay, nay, do not tremble; I cannot bear thy tears, they make me doubt thy forgiveness, love. Thy pallid face, thy tremulous lip, thy hidden eyes, oh, do not break my heart, Elvira, look up, look up, dear, once more.' `I cannot; ah, Harold,' murmured Elvira, in a voice scarcely audible. Harold pressed her beautiful hand to his lips, wrung out the rain from her redundant tresses, and drew her, cold and shivering as she was, to his heart, as her home, her fire side, forever and ever. `And can it be, Horold,' she whispered, or rather murmured in his bosom, `that thou too, hast loved another—that—oh, I cannot speak it.' There was a thrilling, tender plaintiveness, something so desolate, mournful, and beseeching in the sweet cadence of her voice, so melancholy, so faint, that Harold put his lips to her forehead, in silence, and let their tears mingle on their cheeks. He could not answer; how could he? The truth, and nought but the truth could he tell; it would be death, he was sure, to the broken in heart, whose dear, dear, voice he had just heard, like one that whispers in her sleep, while her arteries are palpitating. Should he deceive her? He coloured, forehead, face, and eyes, at the bare thought. `No! no!' he cried, aloud, `I will perish first, myself, yea, see her perish first.' He held her yet closer to his bosom, she scarcely breathed, and he was like one suffocating, in the bitter and terrible trial. Her heart had never doubted, never, except for a moment, and that had been forgotten, that Harold's love for her was his first love. And as she thought what that first love, in such a nature must be, so passionate, so unreserved, so delicate, yet so enduring; it had been the keenest luxury of consolation to her afflicted and broken spirit, in her bereavement and desolation, to have inspired it—But— Harold held her hands pressed convulsively to his heart; this was the very room; that, the very window through which he, the spoiler, came—that perhaps the— `Oh, Elvira,' said he, in a voice inarticulate with emotion, the dim moonlight about them, her wet hair parted upon her pale forehead, and her cold cheek resting, like marble, against his mouth, `oh speak to me, banish me, trample on me, kill me, but speak to me, Elvira, mother of Leopold.' At the sound of that name, she uttered a faint cry, and attempted to break from his encircling arms; but no, no mortal force could have plucked them asunder, without his consent. `Oh Elvira, my beloved, listen to me, I cannot deceive thee. I may be pronouncing mine own death, I may, but I love thee too tenderly, too devotedly, to deceive thee. I have loved another—I love that other yet. There, thou art free now, forever free, if thou wilt not forgive me.' His arms dropped lifelessly at his side, a brief tremour followed, as she haughtily put forth her hand, and turned away her eyes, but his were upon her, and he saw her countenance fall, and the tears upon her lip like rain; and he felt that she had forgiven him. `Oh bless thee! bless thee, love!' he cried, straining her again and again to his heart, as she leant over him, and, timidly, put her soft mouth to his eyelids. The struggle was fearful indeed. His chest heaved, and his breath rattled, like blood falling upon a marble pavement, as he awaited her forgiveness. His manly frame was convulsed, the sweat fell from the ends of his fingers, and the hot tears bubbled under his lashes. She thought he was suffocating—he was—it was a mortal struggle, and another minute he would have been dying at her feet, with his heart burst. What could she do? She was a woman—she forgot her own sorrow—drew him to her lonely heart, pressed his cheek to hers, and whispered, in the tenderest musick, `I do forgive thee, I do.' VOL. II. 23 At the touch, Harold shivered from head to foot, with delight. All the earthiness of his heart was instantly precipitated, and the purer part went up to heaven, sublimated, and etherealised, in prayer. He sat down, and, with his arm around her waist, her head upon his shoulder, and her hands in his, recapitulated all the adventures of his boyhood. Elvira fainted. What troubled the lady? Was there a more glowing distinctness of passion in his manner, when he spoke of the Indian girl, than when he addressed himself to her? What shook her so? Was it jealousy? Why did her heart fail her, when she attempted to speak? She desired to be, but trembled so that she could not be, very minute in her questions. She would have known something more than Harold had told, yet she dared not ask him. What was it? Whence was that delicate perception, which, like another sense, looked through all his looks and words, and ached over a more mysterious meaning. He had loved another. He had loved her. But how had he profited of his love? Oh Harold, where was the holiness of thy flame, when thou didst quench it in passion? `Had he—it might be—the rifler'—but no, no, she would not think of it. The thought was hateful. They were silent, and their silence was devotion. Their hearts were too full to utter a word. The palpitation of hers had subsided, and, by her breathing, Harold thought that she was asleep. How delightful the thought! What a moment for the devout and loving! He feared to move or breathe, and when her gentle hand, as he unwillingly released it, fell down, in its sweet lifelessness, and she raised her head and murmured, poor Harold was really the happiest creature on earth. `Where am I,' said she, `oh! Harold dear! is it thou? I have been dream—thinking of thee, and I was afraid to open my eyes, lest it might be a delusion.' `And couldst thou sleep, so quietly, in my arms, dear, if I were not now worthier than I have been?' `I could sleep there forever, worthy or unworthy, I had almost said, dear Harold—but no, only while thou wast what thou art.' They had watched so long of late, and Elvira was so full of purity and confidence, being too, in her own house now, of which she was the undisputed mistress —this chamber so communicating with that, where Harold had formerly slept, that he could escape at any moment; and he, too, was so happy, and so weary with his happiness, that before they knew it, they were sleeping again, both together, in the moonlight folded in each other's arms—it was but for a moment, with Elvira; for the instinctive delicacy of her mind forsook her not, even in slumber, and she gently disengaged her arm, and was on the point of pressing her lips to his forehead, and leaving him, while he slept, when, just as they approached, she was struck with a ghastly paleness in his face, and a quick convulsion of his features, as they darkened with the agitation of his thought; and she paused, and her eyes filled, as he continued talking in a low, deep, passionate voice, as to some loved one— `Yes, yes,' said he, `believe me, I do forgive thee. I do not even charge thee with my death, love. I murder thee! I! I deceive thee! I talk unkindly to thee! I! Mistaken girl! I have loved thee; I still love thee; I shall love thee forever. I am weeping, not for myself, death has no terrours for me; nay, I do not repine that I am dying by thy hand, love—I weep only for thee, for the time will come when thou wilt think of me, of my love, and faith, and tenderness; and then, oh, thou wilt weep such tears as I am now shedding. No, my still beloved one, I am not angry with thee; by these tears, these kisses, I do forgive and bless thee—' Here Harold awoke, and seeing a woman, meekly leaning over him, it seemed that he took her for the creature of whom he had been dreaming, for he continued his incoherent murmuring, until she broke from his grasp, at the sound of a name—it was not hers, it was Loena's! He outreached his arms to her, as she fled—`what, art thou not Loena? Oh, I am sick at heart; thou art not the murderess—stay, dearest, stay, Loena would have killed me, but thou, thou wilt not desert me, wilt thou, dear?' Elvira returned, listened to his disturbed dream, blessed him with her gentle lips, and departed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. `What shall we do, now?' said lady Elvira, to Harold, as they sat, leaning in the starlight, against an old, and decayed oak, that outspread its wilderness of branches over a bed of spotted rocks, that glittered in the thin water, as it rattled by them, and sprinkled the rich and variegated moss with a profusion of fine drops, like seed pearl, or crystal dust. It was their favourite retreat of late. From it, they were now accustomed to see the lordly sun descend from his chariot, and trample over the hills, while the whole concave of heaven was flashing and changing with the irradiation that issued from his garniture. `What shall we do? This life is not worthy of us. Where is our ambition? thine, and mine?—Ah, do not look so sadly, Harold. It is not utterly extinct. Thy path is not yet over the bleak and iron precipices of life—but thy stature is too lofty, and thy stride too far, for the plains. It hath not perished—hath it?' `No, Elvira, no! it hath not, cannot perish!' said Harold, pressing his hands to his heart, with strong emphasis—`But our Ambition—no, not ours, but mine, has been a wasting, and discontented spirit. I should tremble to see her resuscitated.' `So should I, Harold. But there is something to be done, here, is there not?' `Yes, much, much. A world is opening before us: and might I be permitted to avail myself of its mysterious and wonderful resources—then, Elvira, then (his eyes lighted, and he stood suddenly upon his feet) then! God himself, only, could shorten my arm, or limit my dominion.' Elvira caught the lustre of his eyes, and reflected it, like a panoply of steel—she turned, and gazed upon him with rapturous astonishment. His fine face was all on fire—his broad forehead, so spacious, so sublime— and his parted lips were full of gallant intensity. `What wouldst thou, Harold?' asked she, tremblingly, with her beautiful arm reposing on his shoulder, and her hand locked in his, and holding back her luxuriant brown hair, her eyes shining in their moisture, the moisture of an overflowing heart, sending up its exhalations to heaven—and eyelids quivering, like white blossom-leaves, in the starlight—`what wouldst thou, Harold?' `Indeed, I know not what. All about the future is vague and indistinct; but this I do feel, (turning about with energy, and facing her, like a prince; with a look, that spoke volumes)—this! that I should be, if I might, something worthy of thee!—or perish—nay, love, tears! yet, who would not weep? I, even I, who never weep but in suffocation, never in pain—even I could fall upon thy bosom, at this moment, and weep, aloud. For thou, Elvira, even thou—wast the first, strong, generous impulse of my nature. Thy hand was the first that awoke, and stirred up the embers of my heart. It was a solitude, a cold hearth stone, till I saw thee. My first passion had blazed brightly, but there was no warmth in it—at thy voice, my mind, a desert till then, swarmed with a gigantick, and kingly population. Nay, do not doubt me—even she whom I first loved—she, who would have sold me, but the other night, to bondage and death—even she, at the moment of my first thrilling, and passionate love, when my veins tingled, my temples throbbed, and the blood gusned from my nostrils, at the sound of her voice—even she could not awaken me as thou didst. But I disturb thee love; why so melancholy? surely thou wouldst not covet such a passion, so unreasonable, so merely constitutional!—O, Elvira, thy deep breathing, the lifeless slumbering of thy hand in mine, betoken a strange answer to my supplication. Art thou unhappy? have I done aught to offend thee? 23* I have. Thou art weary of her name. I do not blame thee, thou majestick creature. Nay, do not tremble so. Do not doubt me. Be assured, love, that it is better for me to speak of the past, though I speak of it in convulsion; no matter at what expense of agony and terrour, than to shut up the poison and death, in the darkness, and solitude, and loneliness of my heart. The silent, secret, settled brooding of the spirit, that may be fatal. This is not. No remedy can reach the hidden wound; to be touched, the sore heart must be unclothed. Then do not doubt me; have I not told my love, openly, freely.' `They love, oh, Harold, Harold, I cannot bear it. To hear thee tell of love to another, is insupportable. My heart sickens at the thought.' `Nay, why that look of terrour? what seest thou?' `Oscar! oh, it is Oscar, himself,' she exclaimed, throwing herself upon his bosom. `Elvira!' said Harold, in dismay—`what ails thee?' She bowed her head upon his hands, kissed them, and wept upon them. Had he understood her? his agony was now like hers. She had loved Oscar: thought of him, even in his arms! It was a pang, a bolt of lightning; it seared his heart, and blinded him, as it hissed through the blood of his overloaded brain. He was speechless. There was a silence—a breathless, melancholy, and almost resentful silence, followed, boding much evil to their haughty, and still trembling hearts. Harold was the first to break it. They were approaching the house; a few paces more, and they would have passed the threshold—a few paces, and they might have gone too far for reconciliation; they would be observed, and every moment of delay would be a new impediment, hindering each, from advancing first. Harold gasped for breath. `Elvira,' said he, pressing the hand, which had hung coldly in his, for many minutes—`can it be? must our acquaintance end here?' She trembled, attempted to reply; but her voice failed her for she was as proud as he, and felt as sensibly, the peril of such a silence, at such a moment, and she leant a little more heavily, for a single moment, upon his arm. He understood it! involuntary, as it seemed, for what will not the heart that truly loves, understand? He understood it, as pardon, and light, and life, and reconciliation. `Heaven bless thee,' he cried, and fell upon her neck, and gently touched it with his lips. `One moment, dear Elvira,' he added, detaining her near the entrance, `let us beware—there are some themes, some! that are treacherous, desperate. Let us not rashly take offence; let us be patient, forgiving. O, Elvira, we shall have much to forget, thou especially, above all—(her countenance was here turned toward him, full of noble, and tender expression; and her eyes overflowed, and her lips murmured like some fountain, hastily gushing out, in harmony and light) above all! let us swear, here, in the sight of heaven, with the recollection of the last few moments upon our hearts, let us swear to be patient, not to resolve, precipitately, not to believe hastily, whatever may happen— thou hast loved before?' `And thou!' `Yes, I admit it. Our experience is alike. Why shouldst thou tremble for me? I do not for thee. I do not feel my heart sink within me, at the mention of his name, though I confess—' `True—but he is dead.' `And how knowest thou, that she is not?' `O, I know she is not!'—She checked herself suddenly, as she said this, but Harold did not appear to observe it, or if he did, the troubled shadow upon his forehead, probably arose at the mention of her name.' `Beside,' said Elvira, reproachfully, `Ye are not faithful in love, as we are.' `O, believe me! we are, indeed we are! we feel with a masculine steadiness, and strength, in our brain, artery, forever and ever.' `I hope not.' Harold paused, and looked down. `Yes, it is true,' he added, `I shall feel a vital tenderness for her, to my last hour—so helpless, so impassioned, so dependent as she was on me, for her whole happiness. Yet, my love for thee is a much grander feeling. I have never felt aught that resembled it, before: so exalted, so pure, so respectful, yet so tender and thrilling. And love, dear woman, like friendship, may differ in degrees, and quality.' Elvira sighed. `My own experience proves this to me. Why that sigh? do I not love thee, as tenderly, as devotedly, as thou lovest me? and why shouldst thou feel a more agitating emotion, at hearing the name of—of Loena, than I do, at the name of Oscar—merciful powers! that cry! Is his name so terrible yet?—`Elvira!' (his voice grew solemn, awfully solemn) `beware!'—a moment's silence followed, which was interrupted, by a sudden alteration of his whole countenance, as if some uninvited, strange thought, had suddenly flashed into his mind, and he continued, in a suffocating, earnest tone. `O, Elvira, hear me—am I—hear me—I will kneel to thee! I do, behold me here. Let me die here, die at thy feet; but oh, speak the truth—O, speak it I conjure thee, by all that we have suffered, or hoped! by all that we have felt, or feigned! by our hopes of happiness here, and mercy hereafter! O, speak the truth, tell me, am I beloved, for mine own sake, or O, is it —is it only for my resemblance to my poor brother! O, speak to me, thy tears are blistering, they fall upon my forehead, like a rain of fire—thy tenderness for him—' `For thine own sake, and thine, alone, beloved of my soul,' said Elvira, sobbing against his cheek. `Now, I love thee, for thine own sake; at first, I did not. At first, I loved thee, without knowing it, for thy resemblance to him, the lord, the sceptred one of my broken heart; but as I came to know thee better, and found in thee all his heroick greatness, with other, and more awful virtues, O, I could not but love thee, then, for thine own sake, alone!—tenderness for Oscar! tenderness! O, no believe me, I never felt aught that resembled it, till I encountered thee. Why, Harold, at the very sound of thy voice, thy tread, I could fall flat upon my face, and weep for joy, sometimes—a delicious and strange languor comes over my heart—a kind of—a something, that I cannot express, makes me so humble, so thankful, when I am near thee! Ah, I am then too happy! I tremble for myself, when I am alone—I look for some calamity to follow; nay, I expect it.' `It is wise, Elvira,' said Harold, tenderly, `we must expect it—be prepared for it—change—suffering —death!' Such was the nature of all their conversation, evening, after evening, until Harold, who had been sending his emissaries all over the continent of America, to obtain accurate information respecting the number, disposition, and resources of the red men, received enough to authorise his revisiting some of the deep solitudes that he had haunted in his youth. `I cannot rest,' said he, one morning to Elvira, as he sat with her hands held to his heart, `I cannot rest. The god of my fathers, the red Logan is upon me! I must redress the wrongs of his children—I must. I must learn their fate.' A few tears, a few expostulations, a parting kiss, and Harold slung his rifle, selected his dogs, the fiercest and strongest of the breed, and with one servant successively visited the Canadian Indians, the Penobscots, the Five Nations, and the southern Creeks and Cherokees. Wherever he went, he was hailed with enthusiasm; he sought for the vestiges of his kindred. There was not a trace left—some said they had amalgamated with a tribe of the Iroquois—others that they had gone to the western world—and others that they had passed that, to the land of souls, and that they had been seen, running their wild horses over the steel pavement of heaven. Everywhere—yes, everywhere, he found the Indian trampled upon, derided, mocked at, scorned, and cheated. His great heart arose within him. Should he build up a coalition, a confederacy? Might he not erect an empire of his own, and roll back, upon the whites, the flood of encroachment, with which they had swept away the red nations of America? Night and day he fevered with this thought. Night and day, was he haunted by wild beasts, and spectres, with crowns upon their heads. He could not sleep; he had no appetite, and was wasted to a shadow, before he brought his menacing and ambitious spirit to confess that war was no longer a profession worthy of the good man; and least of all, such a war. This was his determination. Was there then no remedy for the red men—no punishment for their oppressors, no employment for his power? Although he might not lay waste and scatter the habitations of the white, was there nothing to be done? He returned to Elvira. Weeks of enjoyment, and confidence, passed away, but his countenance was still thoughtful, and even stern at times—yea, wrathful. She was leaning upon his shoulder, one day, and her beautiful arm encircled his neck, negligently, but affectionately; he had been silent for many minutes. `I must go—I will!' said he. `Well, then, go,' said she, smiling, `if you must and will.' Harold put his hand to his forehead, `he did not understand her,' he said,—`not from thee, love—not from thee.' `And whither, then?' `To England! Aye, woman of my heart, to England, brave old England,' pressing his lip to her snowy forehead, while the scarlet flew over it, like a flash of fire. `To England! how? when? for what?' said Elvira, turning deadly pale. `Immediately; in the first ship, to get law and right for my derided countrymen.' `But how?' `By shaming to scorn the ministry, the plantation committees, and the council board. Gracious heaven! how blind and deaf they are!—here have they parcelled out an empire, and given kingdoms to the petty, depredating pedlars of the country—loosened a set of hell hounds, hungry and fleet, among the naked population of a continent, to lay waste, and spoil. It shall not be, Elvira, it shall not be! One effort, and we shall be happy. That effort be mine. Yea, love, thou and I will then be happy.' She understood him. This was the first time that he had ever audibly alluded to that event, and she thrilled and shivered from head to foot, as he did so now. Harold was rapid in resolve, but more rapid in execution. His materials were ready. In two weeks from that day, he was under sail, with Elvira, from America —preparing his proofs to confound the ministry. He soon arrived, and strong in the consciousness of his power and honesty, he carried his remonstrances directly to the Premier, (the greatest that Britain ever saw in her cabinet.) `The question shall be taken up,' said the Premier, returning the papers, with an eye of strong anxiety and respect, `in due season. We shall want your assistance. You will take care not to be out of the way. Leave your address, and we will send for you.' The Premier was as good as his word. Notice was given in the house, the very next evening, that a parlimentary investigation would be moved on the following Monday. The motion, at first, appeared to excite little or no attention; but, as it came to be considered, in all its consequences, and relations, the genius of the British constitution herself was invoked, and arose with a disturbed and darkened countenance. Confederacies were formed, council engaged, and most of the chartered communities of the empire were agitated. Even the East India Company participated in the general sensation, and manifested their solicitude by vehement efforts to suppress the inquiry, probably as a precedent, by which they might be reached, at some future day, if it were not protested against, in its very conception, or strangled in its birth. The momentous day came, and after a desultory debate, a formal motion was made to appoint a committee from the house to inquire into, and report upon the manner of treating and trading with the North American Indians, by the British colonial governments, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Harold was in a fever. The house of lords had been two days vehemently occupied, when Harold, who had regularly taken his seat in the gallery, began to be pointed out, and talked of with eagerness, enthusiasm, and extravagance. On the third evening he had scarcely taken his seat, when he was called out by the serjeant at arms to attend the house, in a committee of the whole. He trembled from head to foot; all eyes were upon him; and when he descended, it was with a desperate courage, that blinded and stupified him for some minutes. Behold him now. He is standing near the great table. The lord Chancellor is before him. The judges of England are about him—her greatest men before and behind him. He dares not lift up his eyes. There is, at first, a continual hum of bustling eagerness and preparation, followed, at length, by a more appalling silence. It grows dark about him. His lips and throat are parched; he sees nothing, hears nothing but a confused ringing in his ears. `Young man,' said somebody near him, `remember your duty—yourself.' Harold trembled the more, for as he turned the flash of his eye in the direction whence the voice proceeded, he was unable to detect the speaker. There was a mist, a darkness before him, and the ermine that he saw was like a white vapour, moving in the wind; the very atmosphere appeared full of faces. He was ready to sink down upon the the floor. `Harold! Harold! Harold! was distinctly breathed in his ear again. He turned, and the wildness of his eye, and fixedness of his look, in the mortal silence of the place, as it wandered over the countenances near him, and then turned away, sicker, and sicker at heart, gave a more noble and interesting, though deathlike expression to his countenance. There was a general, and delighted murmur of encouragement. `Son of Logan!' said the voice aloud, as if passing over him in the air. `Powers of heaven!' cried Harold, his great spirit breaking out, all at once, at the sound, as if he were suddenly transported to the wilderness—as if, at that instant, he stood before, no ermine and coronets, but naked men, under no dome but the dome of heaven, lighted by stars and council fires. The change was instantly greeted as portentous. To the looks of compassionate solicitude, doubtfulness, dismay, and trembling expectation, there instantly succeeded an animated and confident expression of hope, in the whole house. Harold's arms were folded. He spoke! the sound of his own voice would have frightened him the moment before, or even a moment later—he spoke! exactly at the extremest moment of his power and self-possession. `Englishmen,' said he, `my lords, why am I summoned to your bar? arrayed against all this formidable accumulation of power and magnificence. Would you oppress me? would you intimidate me? I was born an American, of an Indian: an Englishman was my father, a daughter of Logan my mother. `I have been told, nay, you have all been told, that I appear as the advocate, the champion, of Indian rights. I am not. God is their advocate, their champion. God himself, with whom my countrymen, the red men of America, hold their communion in the deep solitudes of another world. `These forms, shame on them—I have submitted to them, my lords, that I might be heard, not for my own sake, for I have no interest apart from my countrymen, but for them. And therefore have I stooped to appear before you, not in my true character, one of the oppressed bowing before his oppressors, and praying that a whole people may be heard at this bar—no!—but merely and only, for so your ceremonies have prescribed, as the friend of one poor creature, one that is helpless, friendless, and naked; one whom you, yes, you, my lords—for your ministers have done it, and you are answerable for it—have stripped of his possessions. Do you ask who this is? It is Logan, Logan himself! my ancestor. VOL. II. 24 `The petitioner, my lords, with his whole family, is in his grave. But their spirits are here, here, at my side! At this moment, Logan himself is whispering in my ears—my voice flows only at his prompting. He comes before you, over the Atlantick; stands before you, in the shape and presence of his child, outstretches his arms, and proclaims aloud the wrong and suffering that you have afflicted him with. He was a monarch. You have shattered his crown, mocked at his calamities, and trampled him in the dust. He was a father. You have left him desolate and alone. He was an ally. You have degraded him to slavery; and the wages of his devotion to you, have been scorn, and oppression, and misery. `His dominion was an empire. It was given to him by Almighty God. He held it by no earthly tenure, no vassalage, no feud, no mediate nor intermediate sovereign, lord or man. How have you reverenced his title? You have spoiled him of his inheritance, butchered his family, and banished him beyond the mountains. `Yet this, even this, is not all, my lords. `The time has now come, when you, as the supreme tribunal of this empire, shall learn the truth of the red men. Oh, you know not what we have suffered. Outrage and derision have been measured out to us, till we have learned to turn sick with hatred and abhorrence, at the very name or approach of a white man. We are numerous, warlike, generous—faithful!—Oh! yes, strange as it may sound, faithful, accustomed as you are to hearing all that is perfidious, and treacherous, associated with the name of the Indian, still—faithful unto death. I know what I am saying, my lords; I am not beside myself. I know what I owe to the dignity of this house; and I am not desperate enough to provoke its power; but I say to you that the red men of America are, and ever have been, and always will be, faithful to them that are faithful. `My lords, you have been abused, shamefully abused. You have been cheated and played with. It is time that you awake—I have come prepared to disabuse you—The proofs are in my hand—these documents will prove to you that your patience, and magnanimity, have been set at nought, blinded, and sacrificed, by your rabble authorities in America. `Remember, I pray you, my lords, that here, in the face of this awful assembly, unused as I am to such a presence, inexperienced as I am, I am prepared to encounter the wrath of all that shall dare to contradict me. Hear me, my lords, hear me calling on the Judge of the quick and the dead, to record my testimony, and smite me with his heaviest hand, here! to dust and ashes upon the spot, if I err, or prevaricate—and now behold me: I lay down my hands upon this gospel, and swear in his presence, and before you, that there never has been a fair treaty violated by the red men of America! Are you amazed? Treaties! gracious heaven! what treaties were they? One party took, and the other yielded. One struck and the other stood still. Kingdoms and states and empires were bartered for baubles; and peace lasted only till these territories were taken possession of, and the white spoiler saw that there was something yet left, beyond, to the red men of America. And yet, even these treaties were kept by the Indians. `Sometimes, it is true, my lords, the Indian, who had been drugged with your infernal poisons, and made drunk by stratagem, would awake in delirium, from the infatuation into which you had beguiled him; and then, like the wild beast in the net, he would rend, tear the meshes with which he had been encompassed. Was this wonderful? Is it wonderful, that men who went to sleep, with whole provinces in their grasp, and awoke, without land enough of their own, to bury their abused children in, should be wrathful and vindictive?' `No!—they were cheated in their treaties. The law of nations permitted them to break and scatter the parchment, that imprisoned them. When their treaties were fair and honest, the red men always kept them. Do ye as much? Is it not, my lords, is it not a part of your political religion, creed—that a treaty imposed upon a nation, by power, terrour, or fraud—in cruelty or wickedness, is no longer binding upon that nation, than while they are unable to break it.' `You keep your treaties, when fair and honest. So do we. You break them that are questionable. We do not. You disdain and scatter all fetters, that are unworthily rivetted upon you. So do we! In what particular then, are we worse than you? Nay, are we so bad? The men of North America adhere to treaties, that the people of Europe would burst asunder, in wrath and ruin, the first moment of their power.' `But facts, facts, are called for. You shall have them. Look at William Penn. Were his treaties fair? Were they ever broken? No! Was the Indian faith ever doubted or denied in that province? No, no! The very women and children slept quietly, with their doors open; and my brethren, the red men, coming in, and going out of their habitations, at all hours of the night! So much for that government. `Turn your eyes eastward. Look into the doings of New Plymouth, and the Providence plantations. Their history is the same. Look to their treaties. All that your lordships would not blush to acknowledge your countrymen as parties to, all!—without any exception, were religiously observed by the red men. I appeal to their history. Their history? God of heaven! From whom have we the history of Indian wrongs, and Indian outrages? From the wronged, and abused, and insulted!—oh, no—no! but from the insulters, the oppressors, the spoilers themselves! O, that some Indian had arisen, to record the doings of the pious and benignant! What a bloody and perfidious tragedy it would have been!—for even now, my lords, even now—I say it because I know it—with my own eyes and ears, have I seen and heard what I say; because I have journeyed from the Atlantic to the Pacific—from the north to the south, exploring the character, history, and sufferings of my poor brethren; even now, are your doings as wise and merciful!' `Look to your own histories. Even to them do I appeal; to them, the records of the zealot, the persecutor, and the fanatick, the interested, and profligate. Look at them! and lo! there are records of such doing, such barbarity perpetrated upon us! there are voices that ought to shake the genius of your empire, were she slumbering within the ashes of its ruin; like the sound of the last trumpet, ringing abroad through all heaven and earth, the empty skies, and the subterraneous solitudes of this globe—and awaken her in fear and trembling.' `But the treaties. Do the French ever complain that the Indians break their treaties with them? No, never. They are magnanimous and wise. Will you go with me, awhile to the south—to the Carolinas? So truly were all the treaties, that bear the common marks of decency, observed by the Indians there, that not one instance of violation on their part, can be found. Nay, so well is this known by the white settlers, and so confidently trusted to by them, that, when a treaty is made with the Indians, it is only necessary to publish it abroad by proclamation, and the very frontier lands, those that touch upon the Indian possessions, are instantly swarming with an awakened, unarmed, yet secure population of young whites. Read it to one of the whites, and according as the terms are, he will abandon his lands; or go to his tillage, with his rifle slung and cocked; or ramble about, with no other arms than his implements of husbandry.' `If the treaty be not more reproachful, more humiliating, more outrageous, than was ever imposed upon conquered rebels, living among the nations of Europe, your Indian allies in America will keep it, as the faith of their fathers. But there are none such of late. All the treaties of purchase, are treaties of abandonment, and surrender; like these made by the abject to, not with, those who have held their hand in the extremity of their provocation, and refrained from annihilating them, even in the excess and rashness of their power.' `Thus much, my lords, for treaties. There are yet other subjects, upon which you are mightily abused. Would you know the Indian character? You talk of your Spartans, your Greeks—you are surprised, my lords, but Indian as I am, I am familiar with the deeds 24* of the Spartan and Roman; and I have read thereof, till my blood thrilled. Why? By heaven, I thought that I was reading the history of my own people. As I passed along, generation after generation of their history, there was not a great act, no, not one, which I could not have paralleled in the history of my own little tribe. Were the Spartans fiercer in combat? more deadly, no! were they more adroit, subtile? persevering? immoveable, taciturn? no—are we more effeminate, luxurious? no—was their chastity like ours? their self-denial, their fortitude? It will not be pretended. Was it ever heard that an Indian offered violence to a woman? never! that he ever cried out, though his vitals were broiling at the stake, though he were blinded and choked by the vapour of his own blood, as it fell, mingling with his sweat, and hissed upon the living coals that encompassed him? no, never!—were they cunning, cautious in war? so are we. Is it a reproach to us? then is it to yourselves. The Indian holds it a mortal reproach to be taken alive in battle, or even to fall— and so should you. Ye are inconsistent. They are not. They would capture without losing a man, if they could, and so would you. What is your art of war? your most consummate generalship? what! but the perfected, scientifick stratagem of the Indian? Is it not the essence of all military knowledge, to do your enemy the greatest injury, with the least injury to yourself? It is; yet the red man is called a coward, and the white, a general! What has given Hannibal his name? Was he more wary, fuller of resources, more indestructible, or vigilant, that the commonest Indian? no! why is Xenephon remembered? for his retreat! why? such a retreat has nothing wonderful in it, except in the strength of them that retreated, to the Indian ear. Our parties, ours! penetrate for hundreds of miles, into the very heart of an enemy's country, and return, often and often, encumbered with spoil, without the loss of a man.' `But, let us speak of their religion. It is said, that they have none. No religion! the red man of North America, no religion! Almighty God! Thou, whom the Indian babe contemplates in his cradle of interwoven tree branches, swinging in the hurricane—Thou! whose thunders and voices are his familiar musick, from his earliest hour—Thou! whom he has listened to, through all his childhood, while thy ten thousand chariots rattled over the rocky mountain tops that surround him—Thou! whom he pursues, and worships, at all seasons—in winter, and summer; in day, and night; in the caverns of the earth, or upon the rude water; in blood and sweat, with the truest veneration; a veneration that can only be felt in his temples, that shame to darkness the most gorgeous of yours, with a simplicity and nakedness of heart, like that of our first parent, when he stood first under thy blue sky, and chanted with the rejoicing elements—Thou, alone, shalt judge if the great heart of the Indian does not palpitate more loudly in his devotion, amid the awful silence of his sanctuary, than any heart among the habitations of the white men! wilt thou not judge us!' `No religion! behold yon patriarch upon his face! There hath he been ever since the sun went down. Look at yon warriour, stretching his glossy limbs in the shadow of yon rifted oak, teaching his naked boy how to feather his arrow and barb his javelin. He is a father. Is he not religious? lo! he is teaching his child to defend his inheritance. He is training him in the first lesson of patriotism, and is not patriotism, religion?' `Would you hear of individual acts of heroism? Hearken to me. I have seen a nation sitting in council—such was their pride and grandeur of spirit, when their liberties were in peril—and calmly deliberating whether they should put all their women and children to death! yea, and I have known the proposition rejected by only two votes![1] [1] This is a fact. General Coffee relates it in one of his official letters, during the last war between the Americans and British. Can ye parallel that? the men of Jerusalem did it, but what other people ever conceived a thought so terrible, so sublime, so surpassing all that Athens thought of, when she fled, with her very gates, and embarked upon the water?' `Look through our whole history. Take the malignant and scornful misrepresentation of our enemies, who dared not tell the truth, and you will find heroick examples, of every virtue, nay the most heroick— love, fortitude, bravery, perseverance, chastity, and all others. There are Pocahontas, Alexander, Logan, Philip of Mount Hope, Opechancanough, and a host of others. Ransack the golden archives of history—tear out every bright and burning page, and I will pledge myself to produce, from the testimony of our enemies, who knew not even our language, and we were a little people, and but little known, and for a few years—an army of blazing parallels, martyrs, heroes, orators, and kings.' `But why pursue the theme of their greatness. Our fathers, where are they? turn your eyes to the south— where are our people? rolled back, nation upon nation, people upon people, from ocean to ocean, from river to river, from forest to forest, from the Atlantick through the wilderness, over the mountains, into the Pacifick! Look at the map! where once their possessions were from the rising of the sun, even to the going down of the same, where there was no outline, no barrier, no boundary, you may now trace, with your fingers, all that remain to them. They are cooped up in a corner, a mere corner of the world, that they once inhabited! My lords! I am authorised to say, and I do say it, with a knowledge of the fact, that of twenty-eight Indian tribes that inhabited South Carolina, in 1670, when it began to be settled by the whites, twenty-six have entirely disappeared.'[2] [2] See Ramsay's South Carolina, 1 vol. 197. `Do you not tremble? will you not weep? have you no compassion for such men, nor for their descendants, so wasted, so scattered! Think of your treatment to them—yes, yours! know ye, ye sceptred, and crowned princes of the land; ye ermined men, that occupy the high places of power and glory in the dominion of your countrymen, as a dominion of the righteous—know ye, that the free-born savage of America, the unfettered roving creature of a continent, is often hunted down, mana cled, bound hand and foot, and sold to slavery, under your authorities. My lords, I do aver, that native Indians have been kidnapped by men of high rank, in your province of South Carolina, and sent to the West Indies, and sold as slaves!—Yes, wars are provoked, and bounties are offered for the capture of Indians, and whole cargoes are shipped to your plantations.[3] [3] Even this is a fact. The history of South Carolina will show it. —Yes, wars, wars, are excited between us, that you may purchase the prisoners on each side.'† † See Ramsay's South Carolina. `You complain of our scalping. You threaten us with the malediction of your God for it. Will you believe me, my lords? I declare it of my own knowledge, that there is not a single province, not one, among all your North American possessions, where the white government has not offered a reward for scalps—The holy charitable, and gentle fathers of New Plymouth, not excepted.' `But let me dwell a moment longer upon features of individual greatness—you will forgive my desultory rambling, my lords, I hope, and attribute it to its true cause, inexperience in these matters, and unsubdued feeling. I have not yet learnt to be calm, or stormy, after the rules of Quintilian. Have you forgotten the Virginia princess, a creature moulded in loveliness, flashing from head to foot, with the irradiations of Divinity—beautiful, even in her complexion, like the Moorish girl, or the young Spaniard—of surpassing grace, and majesty; so devoted, so tender, so passionately tender! need I repeat her story? when the bravest of your name, he, who among adventurers was the chief; among knights, the loftiest, and among the romantick and chivalrous, the first, and foremost; she was his preserver!' `Have you heard of Philip, Philip of Mount Hope? By the eternal majesty of heaven! Greece, and her Philip of Macedon, with all his intrigue, are less terrible, less wonderful in history, than are Philip of Mount Hope, and his confederacy! For thirteen years, the Indian Philip held all the jarring spirits, and warring materials of the north, in a coalition, that laughed to scorn all the strength and subtility, all the intrigue and suspicion of his encompassing enemies! He amalgamated whole tribes, bound together mortal and hereditary foes, the timid and haughty, the wavering and arrogant; yea, built up to himself an empire, almost of elements, more conflicting and volcanick, than were ever assembled before, by the might or wisdom of men. And they obeyed him; they! for thirteen years of darkness and temptation. For thirteen years, that man continued at his work, day and night, augmenting his power in silence, and concocting his tremendous drugs in darkness, and they who begirt him, round about, who looked upon him as their prisoner, vassal, slave—when they awoke, and saw the chain of annihiliation contracting about them, like a tremendous serpent, knew not where to touch a single link or coil, with any hope of escape! Ruin and death had enmeshed them, while they watched like armed sentinels over naked men! For thirteen years, did Philip of Mount Hope play this game. Did he of Macedon do as much? no, no, he could not have done it, he was not the man to do it—Not the statesman, the captain, nor the politician, to do it! The Indian Philip was the more wily, indefatigable, resolute, and unappeasable of the two. I appeal again to history. Your whole population were within a few hours of being exterminated, and how were they saved? Great God! you talk of treachery! you talk of faith in war! you, ye men of Plymouth! O, shame on your memories! ye cruel, cowardly assassins! Ye were Philip's murderers, not his conquerors! You bought his blood, the blood of a monarch; set his confidential friend, his minister, to the work of death, yea, and boasted of it when it was done! What Indian ever did this? what barbarian, whose name has not been left weltering and accursed, in the blood that he had so basely purchased!' `Would ye have another instance, another, of your damnable perfidy? My lords, my lords, let me mention one more, one only, for my heart is bursting!' `Some of your whites, in their wantonness, were robbed of their horses, by some of the western Indians. A quarrel ensued, and some whites were killed. Governor Littleton of South Carolina, demanded the murderers. The Indians treated his demand respectfully. They called a council. They selected thirty-two chiefs from among them, of the best blood, and bravest name, in their nation, and sent them all, as ambassadors, mark me, as ambassadors, to the governor, to remonstrate, and conclude some treaty, promising to deliver the murderers, when they were known, and caught. And this was all that they could do. These ambassadors were thrown into prison. Their countrymen heard of it, and their proud hearts boiled over at the indignity. They entered the territory of the whites for vengeance. What then? these thirty-two ambassadors, coming under the holiest sanction of religion and law, the law of nations, were imprisoned in a room not large enough for six persons;[4] [4] See Ramsay. and then, for this was not enough, it seemed—it was afterwards ordered that they should be ironed hand and foot, aye, ironed! The attempt was made, and he who first proffered the manacles, was struck dead at the feet of the Indian. This was the signal for massacre! the whole garrison fell upon them, unarmed, and defenceless as they were, and butchered the whole thirty-two, and threw them out, to welter and bleed, like carrion, under the beak of the vulture.' `There was another affair too, in Pennsylvania, where a body of helpless Indians, who had given themselves up to the faith of the government, were broken in upon at night, even in their place of refuge, the common jail, and butchered, every living creature, in cold blood.' `But I cannot go on. My heart is too full—O, my lords, believe me. You know us not. You are profoundly ignorant of our qualities. We are powerful and warlike, stern, vindictive and implacable, where it is a virtue; but kind and generous, and devoted to excess, where it is wise to be so. `My lords, I tremble for you! You have made us desperate. Twice, nay three times, have we associated in a coalition so tremendous, as to involve every living creature of the whites, in its contemplated work of wrath; and thrice, almost by a miracle, have you escaped, when our plans were matured, and all the dangers of preparation were passed. `This day, my lords, I have heard language in this house,—that—oh, if I were but one of you for a few hours, I would lift up my voice like the thunder of my native hills, and pray you to forbear—this day have I heard such language, such consummate misrepresentation of our rights and history, nay of our very geography, that I should have been moved to pity and scorn, were it not that my tears blinded me. Our continent has been cut up into islands by one of your members, and whole provinces converted into lakes and rivers, by the blundering of your statesmen. You smile, my lords; I am sorry for it, the solemnity of the subject would—but I forbear—I could have wept, aloud, but I am an Indian. `We have been called Scythians. Call us so—we bend the bow of the strong man, and our enemies are sacrificed in blood, and flame. Great names have been cited, yet I, Indian as I was, I did not tremble. I dare to evoke the same. Grotius has been cited, yes, Grotius, he who so gravely deduces our relationship to the Chinese, from a number of ridiculous fables, which, theory and all, he has stolen from another.[5] [5] Hornius. Orig. Gent. Am. Lib. 1. cap. II. et III. He says that wrecks of Chinese vessels are found upon the shores of the Pacific, that we worship the sun, that we write, like the Chinese, from the bottom to the top of the page— `Others affect to find traces of the Jewish ritual among us. Others the customs of Tartary. Others that we are Christians. And others say we cannot be descended from the Tartars, because we have no horses!—no horses! because, say they, the Tartars would have carried their horses with them, even in shipwreck and storm. Others say that we are from Norway, and that much of the Norwegian dialect, and German language, is to be distinguished among us. And others again would make us Welchmen!—But why reiterate such nonsense. It is only the childishness of learned men. It is no matter whence we are sprung, from the sun, or the earth, the whirlwind; or, like Adam, from the nostrils of the Deity. Enough for us, that the everlasting God is our friend. Your Creator is our Creator. Of the same elements, the same materials, as you are made, we are made. We have all the same passions, the same infirmities, and are accountable to the same God. Are we not also in his image? Woe to the hand, then, that defaces or pollutes it? But who has done this? You, you have done it. You have wronged us, mocked at us, trampled on us, trodden us in the dust, rolled us back, nation upon nation, people upon people, until we know not where to set our foot, or lay our heads. Beware! Ye have mightily wronged us. `You complain—of what? Because we have made war upon your wives and little ones. Men! men! would ye not do the same? How came you upon us? We were naked and helpless—you, invulnerable—we met you with bows and arrows; and you wielded the thunder, hurled the lightning, at our hearts. Was it not so? Suppose that some people should descend upon you from the clouds, and literally charge upon you in a tempest of fire, shod and sheathed and panoplied, from head to foot in armour, and rain down blood and death upon you. Suppose that you should be persuaded to receive them, feed them, watch them; and that in return you should be driven back, back, back, forever back from the fires, and dust and bones of your ancestry, having left no hunting grounds, no burial places, no land that was your fathers', would you not turn upon them in your desperation? would you not? Would you not yearn to requite upon them, living or dying, the evil that they had visited upon you. Would you spare them? or their old men, or their women, or their children? Would not the law of self preservation command you to their death? Oh, let me beseech you, ask yourselves. Would VOL. II. 25 you not lay them waste with fire and pestilence, grinding their bones to dust, and giving their ashes to the wind and water, their blood to the desert?' `Such was our case! Ye came upon us with fire and thunder; not, it is true, of the clouds, but of the earth. You arose from the Ocean. Ye sat yourselves down upon our altars, with our household gods, ate with us, slept with us, drank of our cup, and ate of our bread; cheated, poisoned and murdered us. Ye drove us backward, league after league, into the black wilderness, where a perpetual rain falls, and the sun is shut out. Yea, even there, when the solitude and silence had become supportable to us, even there, you pursued us; but we were at bay! we turned, we fell upon your tombs, your sepulchres, your hearths and fire places, your cradles; we spared neither wolf nor whelp.—Tremble.—I have done.—Tremble!—The vengeance of the Almighty will not sleep forever.—I have done—My strength, but not my courage, is exhausted. God forgive you, men of England, if you slight my voice. My voice!—it is not mine. It is the voice of congregated multitudes, of whole nations, lifting up their pinioned arms, and shouting for redress. It is their voice that you hear. Bear patiently with it. It is their right. Do you righteously with them, and so as you do unto them, and theirs, this day, may their God, and your God, do unto you, and your posterity, forever and ever, in the retribution of his power.' He sat down, overwhelmed and speechless, amid a general burst of feeling and consternation. The house literally trembled and quaked with his presence. Never had the walls of the Roman capital shaken to such tremendous denunciation, so original, so majestick, so wild and vigorous. His front and bearing, the impressive action of his limbs, his illuminated eyes, his gathered brow, the changing of his cheek and forehead, the planted tread, and free, lordly motion of his arm— Oh, they were astonished and dismayed at it. They who, for half a century, had been familiar with all the sublimity and power of a British senate, in all its beautiful and majestick proportions; they, who had been accustomed to having their passions assailed, for half a century, by wisdom, eloquence, and address, without effect, without excitement, without emotion; they, even they, their eyes were flashing, and their lips quivering, when Harold sank down, like men that are contemplating a great battle, between giants, within the solitude of a continent. Harold fainted—and whole years afterward, he would turn deadly pale, when he thought of what he had encountered, on this occasion. So it is—our blood will run cold in thinking of a transaction, which, at the time, scarcely disturbed us. The effect was, indeed, most flattering. A thousand officious hands were thrust forward to his support; a thousand eyes glanced encouragement and delight upon him. But one countenance—one, the first that he saw when he awoke, one that he never forgot, it haunted him to his last moment, its awful front, so high, so full of composure and solemnity, so steadfast, so dignified, a face for Michael Angelo to dream of, so mild, and old, and resolute, and august, oh, I cannot describe it—that countenance was nearest to him. `Young man,' said a voice, bending over him, `when you have recovered, you will follow this gentleman.' Harold bowed, he could not speak, there was such an air of royalty about the retiring presence, that he could have sworn it to be of the blood of kings. Harold was mistaken. The princely stranger was not even of the nobility. But he was more. He was a man, a statesman, one who watched and revered the first working of greatness in the young. Harold followed his conductor. They arrived at a magnificent old-fashioned pile, so retired and built round about by trees and walls, that, but for the court yard, thronged with splendid equipages, Harold would have believed himself approaching some battered fortress of gone-by days, that had withstood the tempestuous visitation of battle and earthquake, wind, age, and thunder. His guide passed on, looking neither to the right nor the left, through a long antichamber, crowded with well dressed people; and Harold followed him, breathing with difficulty, and feeling an awe that he would have blushed to confess, at the presence of so much parade and ceremony. His guide too, youthful and kind as he was, appeared to move with more stateliness, and tread with a less vascillating emphasis, as he passed through the throng of anxious eyes and throbbing hearts, and approached the abiding place of the great man. Nay, was not that action of his hand, that careless nod, somewhat haughty, arrogant, supercilious? Was he one of those who reward with smiles, because they are too dastardly of spirit to frown? No, he and his master were alike. They gave the whole, or nothing. One more step, only one more, and Harold stood before the stranger. His presence was unexpected, it seemed, for the latter appeared to thrust something into his bosom, with a little trepidation, as he looked round. `Young man,' said he, `sit down; Mr. Morville will call in an hour for his instructions.' The conductor bowed, reverentially, affectionately, and departed. The stranger took out his watch, looked at it, `three quarters, yes,' said he, in a low voice, and then laying it on the table, repeated in a louder tone, `I have just three quarters of an hour to devote to you. Tell me who you are? what? whence? your pursuits, temper, and views. Treat me as your friend, as if I had known you from your birth. If I find you deserving, I can, and will be of service to you. You have astonished me to-day. But that is not sufficient to satisfy me. It is easier to astonish, than to reason, to electrify than to convince. Make it appear that you are, what I think you are, and I am your friend.' Harold bowed; he was unused to such majestick kindness and frankness. He told his story, however, distinctly, bravely, with all that natural and burning energy, so eminently his own. The other's eyes darkened with pleasure. He had never witnessed aught that resembled this. It was a colloquial power, of such direct, downright, intrepid promptitude, that it amazed him. Harold was naturally modest, very graceful, and full of energy. His language was sometimes, and particularly on this occasion, bold, accurate, and singularly beautiful. `It is very remarkable,' said the truly great man, as in a revery, when Harold had finished, `there is one thing that you have omitted. I remind you of it. If it be an unintentional omission, say so, at once. I shall pursue you no further. No matter what may be your motive; I shall respect it. But, if you can answer me, and will, I shall be gratified. I would have no half confidence. Enable me to say that I know you.' `I will withhold nothing from you sir,' said Harold. `Well then—your family name, birth?' as he said this, his eagle eye glanced upon Harold, with a peculiar and mysterious earnestness of expression. Harold replied distinctly to both questions, watching his countenance the while. No emotion was visible, none! in his great forehead; but his noble chest heaved slightly, at long intervals, as with some deep and ancient recollection. Tears, gracious heaven, tears. It was too true. Harold could have fallen upon his knees before the august creature, but he waved him off. `Leave me awhile,' he said, `the time has expired. There is my hand. I am your friend. I knew your father. (His voice trembled.) Come to me, to-morrow, at the same hour.' Harold obeyed, and the next day, precisely at the moment, stood again, at the door of the chamber. He was instantly admitted. `Harold,' said the mysterious man, after a distressing silence of some minutes, during which he sat leaning upon a table, with his face buried in his hands, and his dark hair moving of itself, over his wrought and agitated brow. `Harold, come nearer to me. I knew your father Hush, we must not be overheard. We will retire to that closet.' `Harold followed him thither, and they were seated. `We were school fellows,' said he. `He had the elements 25* of a disorderly but great nature within him. There was no boy that bid so fair to be great, as your father. I trembled in his presence. I was afraid of him; and no man ever made me afraid. He carried authority and dominion in his very tread. We had a quarrel. It was on my account—' He paused. The working of his forehead spoke grievously of what he had suffered; there were grief, sorrow, and passion in its movement, sullen and distant, and indefinite, however, like shadows painted from recollection. `It was on my account that he left England forever-' Here the speaker's voice trembled, and his whole frame shook; he arose and walked, several times across the apartment, struggling tremendously with some unintelligible feeling, and exclaiming at last— `No, no, I cannot.' Harold was amazed—such perturbation in such a countenance! Why, it was as if some pyramid had grown tremulous with the stirring of its buried, blasted and withered inhabitants—the spectres of the past. `I read your astonishment, sir,' said the speaker, `I do not wonder at it. I have deceived myself, mightily, mightily—there are embers among the dead ashes, here, here. Nature will arise, and will be heard, though you bury her with years and snow, yea, though you pile upon her the affairs of an empire. At this moment, (he dashed his hand over his eyes, as he spoke, and frowned, as at his own weakness,) `the warmest, noblest, most romantick feelings of my youth have arisen, like spirits. They have touched me, and I thrill from head to foot. I feel as if a score of years were suddenly taken off my heart; as if the darkness were suddenly brushed away from the beautiful tablets of memory, and all her first record and inscription were illuminated.' He still continued walking about, in great disorder, but at length stopped, abruptly, before Harold, saying, as to himself, `boy, boy, how like his father. Yes Harold, Harold is thy name, I think, (Harold bowed,) thou art like thy father. Woe to thee. It were better that thou hadst never been born. It were better to herd with the vilest, weakest, the most abject and insensible, forever, than be wrung by one such pang as we feel, daily, hourly, even in our pride of power. No sympathy, no affection, no holy consecrated sweet communion of the heart, no stillness, no solitude, are ours. We have nothing in common with our fellow-men, nothing in love or friendship, nothing but the incessant cold, and lifeless glitter of ceremony and pomp. Boy! beware of thy nature. Trample down the fierce spirit that I see in thine eyes. Wrestle with it, subjugate it. We are always tyrants or slaves. Choose thou, this day, which of the twain thou wilt be. But time passes—It is the last time, too, that we shall meet. I dare not trust myself with thee. I would fain do somewhat for the son of my earliest friend, and, if possible, teach that son how to avoid the melancholy consequences of his own nature. Sir, your intrepid, fearless, resolute, adventurous manner is alarming to me. True, it has that bearing of noble confidence, which only the generous and great can feel, what no human being can affect or counterfeit; but it is dangerous always, and often fatal. Harold, I could have come down from my seat and embraced thee, yea, knelt with thee, upon the floor of parliament, had not this apprehension disheartened me. But stay—' `Your father, as I have said before, was my friend. I was his. We loved the same woman. But we knew it not. He was haughty and implacable—I would not go on, but the truth must be told, shall be. He married her, married the woman of my heart! (he covered his face with his hands, and his fingers were convulsed upon his temples.) It was that, that which made me what I am, a wretch, of kingly power and dimensions, it may be, but a wretch. That marriage kindled a spirit in me, which has blazed for thirty years, is blazing yet, will blaze, while there is life enough in these vitals to feed it.' `About a year after his marriage, and after the birth of Oscar, I saw his wife. We had loved. I know not that I ought to blame George of Salisbury; but though he did not unfairly win her, yet I lost her unfairly. I saw her, for I was going to the continent, with the intention of bidding her an eternal adieu. We discovered that she had been wrought upon, cheated, and betrayed, not by him, I verily believe, but by her relations. The whole conspiracy came out in our interview; she was agitated to tears, pale as death. We heard his footstep. I knew it not, but she did, and fainted. I caught her in my arms, her dishevelled tresses floating—great God! I cannot go on—Suffice it to say that he assaulted me, wounded me, and left her for dead upon the floor. He fled; we knew not where, but we soon discovered that a devil had been his ruin, the devil jealousy. I had kept my attachment to his wife before her marriage, a secret; whether wisely or not, it is now too late to determine; and she, too, had adopted the same secrecy. Believe me, our reasons were good. Your father was actually married before I knew the name of his wife, (I had known her abroad, in Spain, for she was born of a Castilian mother,) and, when I discovered it, I was stunned, blinded, as by a clap of thunder. She had been treacherously wrought upon, and, in an evil hour gave her hand to him, at the same moment, burying my name and memory in her heart, never, as she thought, to be again disturbed. Such is an outline of our reasons. But your father knew them not—all that he knew, was the prompting of some fiend, who persuaded him of his wife's—curses! ten thousand curses on him, and his, for the insinuation!— her infidelity. He watched us, attributed our accidental meeting, for it was purely accidental on her part, and almost so on mine, though I had long wished it, to premeditation. But—you know the rest.' `Your father fled, to America, it seems now, for, many years after I have reason to believe that he reappeared for a season, with some fell purpose of revenge, and that he was appeased by his desolate wife. I never saw her afterward. I knew her pure spirit, her exalted nature too well, to hope for aught in my favour, although we had been assured of his death. She never could, never would have married me, though she loved me, and would have died for me, after an event so disastrous and malignant. She gave birth to another daughter, in her retirement—that sigh! ah, she was the very picture of her mother, so gentle, so beneficent, so beautiful, timid and pure—Oh, my heart, my heart fails me—I could throw myself down and cry like a child, at the memory of what the mother was. I feel, Harold, just as I felt, when we last parted, in Andalusia, of a starlight evening. I never could abide the starlight since. Harold, I confess that I am weak, very weak, but I love thee; I feel as if thou wert my son for thou art his, and he was her husband. Would that thou wast her child! Statesmen are but men; ministers, disguised as they are, encumbered as they are, with the parade and pageantry of dominion, are but men.' `Nay, our feelings when touched rightly, in mystery and power, flow but the more fiercely, for the unnatural secresy and restraint in which they have been held. I have now done. You have heard all. What can I do for you? The army? the navy? a post? are your circumstances easy? Are you ambitious? You are, and there is my hand. The world will have it so—I will make your fortune. And yet—for there I spoke like a man of the world, a politican—now I speak like a father—I could almost go down on my knees to thee, my son, and pray thee to turn thy back upon my offers. Refuse them, and thou wilt be happy. Accept them, and thou wilt be great, great as the world goes, but wretched, wretched!' Harold replied, modestly and firmly; thanked him, and declined all assistance, all countenance. `Your reasons, Harold?' Harold gave them, in his temperate, assured way; and the minister embraced him, and wept upon his neck. `Boy!' he cried, with enthusiasm, his old eyes sparkling through their lashes, like lamps abruptly kindled; `thou art an honour to thy name and house. Bear that spirit with thee, to thy grave. Go back to America. Be there, as thou art here, the friend of the Indian— his champion. God prosper thee!—embrace me—again! there! there! farewell!' Harold turned to depart, when the great man embraced him a third time, and buckled upon his thigh a magnificent sword. `Wear that,' said he, `in memory of me.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. How changeable is man! Harold had withstood, resisted, derided all temptation, in the presence of a monarch, for the power of him that he had left, was that of a monarch. Royalty was upon his forehead, command in his tread, and greatness in his hands. While there, there, in the very abiding place of Ambition, whom he had so long idolized, there, he had resisted her dominion, and taught her to cower before him. With this feeling, he had descended, and trod through all the glittering retinue of the audience chamber, and court, with the stately, free step of a native Indian; but, as he approached his own home, a deep sigh escaped him, it is in vain to deny it, and a half articulate wish that he had taken a little time for consideration. `But perhaps, perhaps, he will repeat his offer,' said he. O, how changeable is man! `Come hither, Elvira,' said he, as she met him, with open arms, and parted lips, at the door—`and let me tell thee all.' He did tell her all, and her heart palpitated aloud at the recital. The fame of his eloquence had already reached her in his absence, and was yet ringing, like musick, in her ears. She had just left her chamber, where she had been weeping with joy and thankfulness. `How proudly thou standest before me,' said she, as he locked her arm with his, and she felt then, as if she could have gone abroad, and heard it proclaimed through all the world, by the sound of trumpet, that he, he was her chosen one—`Behold him,' she dia say, `how calm he looks, and yet, he hath just shaken a British senate with the thunder of his eloquence! This pale, pale brow hath just been elevated, amid the princes and magnates of the land!' A few days more, and it was determined that they would marry, as men and women should marry, in silence, and apart from the world. Harold detested the shameful fashion of marrying before a mob, but still more, the indecent practice of exhibiting your wife to strangers the day after marriage, that day of all others, which ought to be most exclusively given up to love and tenderness; when each is most eager to be near the other, to give and impart consolation, which, to the loving and beloved, who see omens in everything, while the heart is too full for company, and too happy and too distressed for parade or compliment, is so apt to be taken for an epitome of their new life. O, it is a shameful, a brutal profanation, to exhibit a pale and trembling girl, sick, sick at heart, with expectation and disappointment, and anxiety, while she is ready to sink into the earth with her newly awakened emotion, to the cold, saucy, and significant observation of gossips, gossips, with, or without petticoats. Strange! but woman, the lovliest, meekest, and most helpless, will brave it out, yea, submit to that, before a multitude of ruffian strangers, which she would shrink from at home, among her brothers and friends. How often will you see a delicate creature exposing her bosom, naked, to a herd of coxcombs, and fools, and profligates, at a fashionable party, who will sit at home, at her own tea-table, among them that she loves, covered to the shoulders, and muffled to the chin! But why preach against such indecency? Is it not the fashion? and although the tamest spirit acknowledges that fashions are generally set by fools, and are generally absurd and ridiculous, and invented only, like the tricks of masonry, to distinguish the patricians, who, heaven knows, have generally most patrician brains withal—that—that—but no matter, it is idle to talk against their dominion. The following Thursday was to be the day. It was now Sunday—the day of peril and trial, consternation and dismay; for who does not feel all this, who reflects on what duties he is about to undertake? to cleave unto his loved one, forever and ever, to comfort and sustain her, watch over her, instruct, and bless her. O, such a vow is enough to make one tremble! It was determined to have the ceremony performed privately, and then, that the new couple should immediately set off for Dover, and then to France. It was near evening. Harold was sitting in his room, the room that Oscar had occupied. It was all in a glow, with the flooding sunset. He was leaning upon his hands; a strange, sweet melancholy filled his heart, up to the very brim. A few bright tears trickled through his fingers. It was delicious, and Harold indulged the feeling, like one that listens to a low, inward, mournful musick, till it operates upon the heart, and his very breathing is an echo. A light, soft step was approaching; it hesitated, hurried, paused, as if doubtful of the reception. `Elvira,' cried Harold, leaping from his chair, and catching her delicate hands, and he would have touched her forehead, perhaps her lips, as usual—but why paused she? what withheld him? O, how sensitive are lovers! Her manner was kind, very kind, and her countenance but slightly altered; yet Harold, as he looked upon it, shivered all over, and was unable to speak. A distressing silence followed; her eyelids were thrown down, and he knew not what to say, or think. Not an hour had passed, since they parted, and she, all light, and love, and tenderness. He was silent, first, from inability to speak; and he continued so, because he was wounded, his affection and dignity were wounded. They sat down. Harold breathed not, moved not, he felt as if some tremendous evil was about to overwhelm him, but of what nature, or whence, he had no conception. `Harold,' said Elvira; `dear Harold.' (She disengaged her hands gently, as she said this, and spoke with a faint, quiet, but very deliberate voice,) `we must part.') `Part, Elvira,' cried Harold,' seizing her hands with a wild cry—a shriek!—another answered him! He had heard it before. All his sufferings broke in lightning, over his brain! He covered his face. He knelt to her!—he pressed her cold hands to his lip—kissed them over and over again, and wept upon them. `O, Elvira,' he sobbed out at last, `O, Elvira, O, it cannot be!' `Hear me,' she replied, faintly, `hear me, arise, let me proceed. Be prepared for every thing. Your first love, she whom you have wept as dead, dishonoured —Loena—nay, nay, dear Harold, not so wildly, pray be more composed, do not look so wildly upon me, nay, nay, let me soothe thee, she is alive.' `Alive!' cried Harold!' she! O, where is she? let me fly to her. No, no, no! wretched girl, no! would that she were dead! O, forgive me, Elvira; I would comfort her for thy sake—but I will not see her; I cannot.' `Yes, Harold, thou canst, and shalt. She is worthy of thy love—there!' Harold fell senseless upon his face, and when he recovered, his head was upon Elvira's knees, and she was chafing his temples; he opened his dark eyes, but shut them again instantly, and his brow darkened with some mournful thought, or some deep, deep, pain.' `She is still devotedly thine—' (Harold pressed her hand, and her tears fell like rain upon his face)—`She was your first love, your only love. You have never loved but one, Harold, as you are capable of loving, I mean.' `Elvira! do not, do not blaspheme.' `O, my dear Harold,' said Elvira, bashfully leaning over him, while her delicate lids quivered with excess of tenderness over her lamping blue eyes, `how I have loved thee, God only knows! Thou hast been a religion with me, my dream by night, my prayer by day. Harold hath haunted me, forever. Gradually, for who can withstand the incessant solicitation, allurement, and importunity of her fancy, gradually have I brought myself to associate all my hopes of happiness here and hereafter, with thee, and thine. I dreaded to VOL. II. 26 do this, yet I did it. My heart had been broken once before, but now, it was to be reduced to powder, dust, and ashes. Nay, nay, Harold, I entreat thee not to interrupt me. This may be our last meeting. Why dost thou cling to me so? I am doing only what thou wouldst do—what thou knowest, is right.—Thou wilt go to thy duty—I—I—to mine—I.' `And, now, O, Harold, now, that we are about to part, for I have determined, and nothing on earth can move me—now I am at liberty to speak, and my heart, swollen to bursting with the fountains of its tenderness for thee, will no longer bear this darkness and concealment—behold! it discharges them now, without shame or trembling! O, Harold, Harold, how I have loved thee! better, ten thousand times better than light, or life, or reputation. Thou hast been to me, all in all, my friend, lover, husband, father, and even my God! for all were forgotten when thou wast near me. O, Harold, thou dear one, may she love thee, as I have loved thee'—poor Elvira's passionate emotion had gradually increased, until she sobbed aloud, as she concluded. Harold knelt to her, and threw his arms about her, in wonder and consternation, dreading it as a dream, yet dreading to awake, and shivering all over, while her temples throbbed against his, and her hot tears fell into his bosom. `It is too much, too much, by heaven!' he cried, `I shall go distracted. Woman! woman! am I mad? or art thou? where am I? who art thou? whom do I hold in my arms?' `Calm thyself, dear Harold,' said Elvira, raising her sweet face, amid her dishevelled tresses. Be happy thyself, and thou wilt make me happy. Thou wilt say, when thou art happy, very happy in her, her arms, —let us bless Elvira! O, think Harold, what a wretch, what a vile and execrable wretch, thou wouldst have had for a companion, for a sharer of thy glory and heart, if I had usurped wittingly, a heart like thine, while its lawful and abused tenant was ready, after the exile of many a year, to re-inhabit it. By heaven! nay, thou must, and shalt hear me! O, do not, do not press me to thy heart so frantickly—O, do not, there, release me, hear now my confession, and remember it. It will be a comfort to thee, in thy dying hour, and Harold, O, believe me, even thy great heart will have need of comfort, in that hour! I have been wicked, very wicked. I have prayed, yes, prayed for the death of Loena—yes, I deserve it, but do not kill me with these looks—forbear a while, I shall not trouble—thee, nor her, long. I have prayed that thy heart might be alienated from her. But I repented. I set an inquiry on foot, and after years of toil and perplexity, I am able to say, thank heaven! thank heaven! that she is innocent, and loves thee yet. And well for her, that she does, for I should hate her else. Harold, I have told thee that I did love thee; and I now tell thee that I love thee now, to adoration—that I never have loved any other human being as I love thee, that I had hoped to live here, and hereafter, within the circle of thy arms. There was to be my paradise, nay, more—' A faint blush passed over her beautiful neck, and was followed by a deadly paleness, and her eyelids drooped— `I have dreamt, and I know not why I should shame to confess it, that—that I had borne children to thee— that we were—merciful heaven!—and is it come to this, and must we part?' `Oh, Elvira, must we indeed?' said Harold. `We must indeed, so intermingled too, so—our very existence blended, in spirit, heart, and blood, and intellect. There! I have told it all now, all! My poor heart is easy—the tightness is over—I can breathe freely now—Yet think not that thou wouldst ever have known the extent of my love, but for this determination, which nothing can alter, that we must part, and forever.' `Judge then, Harold, of the sacrifice that I make, in parting with thee, to my rival too. I do it, to punish my transgression, my idolatry. And now, Harold, now, am I not worthy of thee?' Harold bowed down before her, bowed down, in the profoundest adoration. It was the homage of all that was lofty in his nature, so deep, so awful, that his blood forgot to flow, as he put his forehead to the earth before her, with the movement and veneration of one, who, prostrate in the lonely solitude, hears musick in the wind. `Heroick woman,' said he, rising and standing majestically before her, with his dark eyes flashing rivulets of light, `I never knew thee till this hour! But now, I do know thee. Take me, even as I am, take me, and let us be happy—but—no, no, if that disturb thee, I will not even ask that. Let me be worthy of thee. Let us live and die in martyrdom to our love. I do not attempt to shake thy resolution. I will not. Wert thou one jot or tittle less magnificent, I should cry out—Behold me, me! Elvira, at thy feet, take me from the earth, retract and bless me! But now— oh, I could not. I respect, I revere thee too much, to intercede for myself. I bow, unresistingly, to thy determination. For myself—there is my hand. I cannot abandon the Indian girl, if she be what she was. I cannot wed another, while she lives, and is innocent, and helpless. I must wed her, and love her, and protect her. She shall die in my arms, or I in hers; for this I promised her, before I saw thee. I shall be a husband, and perhaps a father. If I shall be, my babes shall learn to pray for thee, dear, as the priestess of love, the divinity of honour. My children shall bear thy name; and now, while my poor heart is aching, with the rupture of all its ties, and the derangement of all its elements, and ready to die, to burst, in martyrdom to love and duty, my love to thee, thou heroick woman, my duty to the poor Loena, I can only say, that I have loved thee, even as thou hast loved me, with all that boundless love and devotion which thou hast manifested. Farewell! For thy sake, dear woman, I will be a good man, for that is always in our power, and great, if it shall please heaven: a husband, and a father, if I am so blessed, the kindest and truest, for thy sake; farewell! Heaven forever bless and protect thee!' `Oh, Harold, my heart cleaves to thine yet,' said Elvira, still weeping, and they embraced, again and again, treacherous as it was, and then separated, in the delirium of their spirits. It was passed and done, the sacrifice accomplished, ere they had once looked upon it steadily, and learnt to contemplate its appalling magnitude, and then, oh then, like all other living creatures, their pride, their unwillingness to be the first in repentance and atonement, continued to hold them with the hands of a giant, upon the path which they had so precipitately chosen. They separated; a voice was heard at the door, and the next moment, angels of heaven! what was it? something stood before him, a creature, who was it? the deep, dark, passionate languishing of her eyes, the sweet and beautiful solemnity of her countenance, oh surely—She extended her hands, they shook slightly, and Harold, blinded and dizzy with her overpowering presence, caught at it, with shut eyes, and staggered to her arms. He was speechless. It was, indeed, Loena; her queenly carriage, the melancholy, black lustre of her eye, the transparent olive, the jetty tresses, gathering round and round her low forehead, like matted silk, the perfectly Grecian outline of her face, the undulating movement of her neck, that inexpressible something, the first raciness and purity of nature, oh—it was enchantment. `Can it be,' cried the bewildered Harold, gasping and choking. `Well, Harold,' said Loena, timidly, as their cheeks touched and thrilled. `Her voice, oh, it is she! the same, the same!' he cried, unable longer to restrain himself, and falling upon her neck, `just as we parted last, ah, it thrills through and through me. And art thou, oh, Loena, dear, dear Loena, art thou mine, at last? Oh, what have I not suffered. But let me ask thee—nay, not now—but I have ten thousand questions for thee. `And can it be,' he repeated, over and over again, holding her beautiful hands in his, and standing off 26* from her with an expression of awe and rapture, till his eyes danced in their sockets, `ah can it be?' For his soul, he could not utter another word, he sobbed, and laughed, and clapped his hands, and shouted, hysterically, as all the past, like a tempest of mingled cloud and light, came driving over his memory— like the cold rain, falling heavily from a thunder cloud, in a blue sky—mingling terrour, and beauty, and chilliness. His countenance changed rapidly, his joints shook, as with the palsy, and Loena was obliged to lead him to a seat. And she—ah then, her composure had passed. She had been prepared for this, he had not. She knew all, and was on her guard for all, that could happen; but even she was now overcome. She covered her face, and leant, could it be otherwise? upon the bosom of her lord. For a moment, a prompt feeling of fidelity to Elvira, caused Harold to repel her approach, for he had been, and would have been hers, and hers alone, but for Loena; but the next, they were locked anew, anew, after years of agony, and trial, and separation, in each other's arms. `Oh, Harold,' said Loena, after several attempts to articulate her joy, `but no, no, I cannot speak. I am still, still the Indian girl, my heart is too full; and yet, it is a pity but thou shouldst know, what I might never have told thee, but for our separation, that Harold I do love thee, wicked as thou art, I do indeed.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. Thus passed, hour after hour, between Harold and Loena, while Elvira was weeping in her room. `Can there be such desolation, such wretchedness in doing rightly?' said she, as she parted her wet hair, and suffered her thin hands to fall, lifelessly, into her lap, `and yet, was I not prepared for all this? Do I envy her? Oh my poor heart, art thou indeed bursting? Well burst, burst, the sooner that thou art insensible, the better. Oh, is it not bitter, very bitter, to be forgotten, so utterly, and so speedily?' But Harold, himself, entered, and put a stop to these meditations. Loena was hanging on his arm, so fondly, so modestly, yet with such an assured expression of comfort and repose, that Elvira, though she smiled faintly at her approach, could not bear to look upon her, and turned away, in tears. `There!' said Harold, gently detaching Loena's arm from his, `there! that is the woman who has given me to thee!' Loena knelt, while her dark eyes filled with tenderness and lustre, and put her forehead to the hem of Elvira's garment. Elvira raised her sweet, noble face. It was very touching, and sad, yet altered beyond expression, within a few short hours. Her eyes, too, they that were wont to glitter, like revolving sapphire, they were now of a dim wintry blue; and her fresh lips were languid; her— `How changed,' sighed Harold, putting his hand, softly, upon her head; but the smile, and the tearful, gentle upbraiding of her lifted eyes, as she put up her hand and pressed his, as it lay there, were almost fatal to his resolution. Harold proceeded; but Elvira, who saw, or suspected something of his purpose, would have prevented him. `No, no,' said he, `she shall know all, all, even at the peril of losing her.' His brow darkened in terrour, as he said this, for he remembered the words of Loena. Were they portentous? he faltered; but, after a momentary struggle, continued thus, with a solemnity that alternately chilled poor Loena to the very heart, and sent her blood, like flashes of scorching fire, over her temples— `Know, my beloved,' said he, `my first love, thou who hast come to take possession of thy lawful inheritance, my whole heart—that—know that, that—but for this noble creature, this! thou wouldst have found it in the possession of another, yea, even of herself. Another week had been too late. I was to have been her husband. I see thee turn pale; I remember thy words. I use no concealment with thee. I see my destiny, and yet, yet Loena, thou shalt know it all. Thou, perhaps, wonderest at my constancy and love for thee—wonder no longer. Both were offered up to her—both, I could have crushed and trampled on—(for I believed thee unworthy)—and both would I have offered up to her, but she turned back the offering, and now—gracious heaven, Loena, what ails thee—speak to me, dear; O, speak to me!' `I cannot speak, I cannot, I am choking. Leave me, leave, I must be alone. Woman! lady! Elvira, let me embrace thee—no, no, no! my pride is over and gone —O, bless thee, bless thee! O, my poor heart! my brain, dear Harold! my brain, my heart—nay, nay, let me lean on thee awhile—there—I have now subdued my feeling—we will meet this evening. I must be left alone till then—I would meditate, and pray.' She departed; and Elvira accompanied her. But how passed Harold these hours of absence and trial? O, ask him not. All about him was black as death. The earth itself, felt unsteady to his tread, and the sky was a tremulous vault, seeming about to pass away, as he looked upon it. The thick sweat, like that of the charnel house, oozed out of his flesh. All the colouring of nature ran together. All her sounds and sights. His heart grew cold within him, and his pulse was sudden and fitful, like an artery discharging its thickest and hottest blood. What a fate was his! to play the hero, and die for it! to be magnanimous and great, and wretched! Where was he to find rest? Where a companion, a friend, who could understand, and glory in his character? Where, that unwearied one, whose dear eyes would be always seeking his—whose bosom would, forever and ever, be his abiding place, aching only when he, its lord, was not leaning upon it—O, where, where, was he now to turn? But they met again. The manner of the ladies was essentially changed, and yet it was mysterious and unsatisfactory. They, and wo to them who are without such infirmities, wore a stately, artificial, and very polite deportment toward each other, in which there was nothing in the world for one to complain of, unless, that it was just exactly the manner that was least worthy of both, on such an occasion. But they were sick and uneasy, not perhaps with jealousy, exactly, because that is such an oriental sort of passion, that it would hardly do to charge such northern ladies with it; but no matter, was it not strange? One had voluntarily resigned him, and begged to be forgotten, and the other held him in the very core of her heart, and yet each trembled with apprehension of the other. And Harold too, discharged as he was in his allegiance to Elvira, while his eyes wandered alternately, from one to the other, as in search of some kind greeting, felt a strange uneasiness in betraying his affection for the newly found, and a deeper disquietude and unwillingness, to be near the newly lost. But Loena was an altered woman. The lifted forehead, and the deep, deep languishing of her dark eyes had passed; her head was bowed now, and the lids and lashes were surcharged no longer with their shadowy, tremulous lustre, but with tears. Yet her voice, and the transparent olive of her complexion, except that a little more of trembling mournfulness, at times, in one, and the alternations, from the deepest crimson to a death-like paleness, in the other, were more frequent than formerly, were just what they were, when he left her in America. Every movement was an effort now, and there were moments when Harold was sure that she could not open her lips, without a sob. `Harold,' said she, at last, when they were alone, (putting her hand affectionately into his) I cannot yet inform thee of my determination; and before we renew that subject, it is my duty to deal as sincerely as thou hast, and relate all that has happened to me. You have not forgotten the young officer?' A quick carnation flashed over her whole face and neck, as she said this, and her eyes, although cast down, shot forth ten thousand expressions, that Harold felt in his very brain. Harold nodded in silence; but his heart beat hurriedly, and he averted his face. `He persecuted me cruelly, bitterly, after you had departed,' continued Loena; but I found a protector. The count was like a father to me. And his family, O, how deeply do I feel their kindness! To them, it is owing that you see me what I am now, a living woman. They saved my life! yes, Harold, and what is dearer than life, they saved me, or rather the count himself, old as he was, at the peril of his life, saved me, from—from dishonour.' Harold leaped into the middle of the floor, and the blood started from his nostrils, but he said nothing, nothing, although his breathing could have been heard in the next house. `Harold, I tremble for thee; these bursts of passion will be the death of thee. But this is not all. I owe yet greater obligations to my mother, the good countess. She taught me to forgive. She taught the Indian girl to be meek and humble—Harold, let me pray thee to be so, too. In short, I was educated as their child. We suffered cruelly at your silence; but, at length, we learnt the capture of the vessel; and just about the same time, the count was recalled, in displeasure, by his king, and, I was left, dependent almost upon the charity of a noble, destitute, and desolate family. Merciful heaven!' `Loena, dear, why that cry? What means it?' `Can it be possible,' continued Loena; turn thy head round again, a little further; there, there, no, not so far—what a resemblance!' `Pray, what means this?' said Harold. `Hast thou a brother, Harold? What an astonishing resemblance! and how strange too, that it never struck me before; but thou art so altered since we parted.' `No, dear, none. I have no brother, no sister.' But Loena continued, gazing at him; `no brother!' said she, running on, in French and English to herself, as if unconscious that she was overheard, and not heeding him at all—`en verite—so exceedingly alike—ma foi!—no brother, none,' and then abruptly addressing him—`O, que j'en suis fâché.' `Pray, place thyself so again—really, I must have a sketch—Je ne saurais m'en passer—there! why, it is Oscar himself!' `Who? what?' cried Harold, awakening all at once, as from a trance;' `what is is the meaning of all this? What Oscar? Who is he? Didst thou know him? my brother!' `Hadst thou a brother, then?' said Loena. `Alas!—poor Oscar—I had!' `Poor Oscar!' she exclaimed, clasping her hands, and uplifting her dark, wonderful eyes, streaming with lustre, and light, and tears, to heaven—`poor Oscar! O, where is that hero? Kind heaven, where is he? O, I would follow him the wide world over, barefooted, and alone—I—' Harold's arm, which, till this moment had encircled her waist and supported her, here fell lifelessly at his side!—Pourquoi?—`Il faut ou qu'il reponde, ou qu'il dise pourquoi!' `And didst thou love him?' said Harold, faintly. `Love him! O, yes, with all my heart and soul—yet stay, Harold, stay, now I bethink myself, not as I have loved thee—O, no! but—where is he? Thy voice now, thy very eyes remind me of him—tears! what has befallen him? Nay, nay, do not look so upon me. What have I done? Unlock thy hands, dear; I pray thee do; throw up the window—O, what have I done? Who is Oscar? and where is he?' `In his grave—the ocean,' answered Harold, convulsively. `Where is he? Shudder, woman; he is standing at the judgment seat of the Eternal—suicide!' `What, dead! dead!' shrieked the Indian girl. A rattling was here heard from the study, and, the next moment, the sound of some person falling. Harold rushed in, and found Elvira utterly senseless, but just opening her eyes, through her dishevelled and encompassing tresses, like one suddenly struck with delirium, by some unearthly cry. `Dead! poor Oscar!' she whispered wildly, and by starts, `dead! where! when? poor Oscar! there! there! he struggles! O, the ship! the ship! mercy!' `And is he really dead?' said the Indian girl, looking up to Harold, while she held the poor blinded, desolate Elvira 's head upon her bosom. `Yes, and destroyed himself,' answered Harold, solemnly. `No! impossible. I know him too well for that. He would never forget his first attempt; his miraculous preservation—his—' `What meaning is there in thy words? I tell thee, Loena, that I saw him; I, with my own eyes, leap overboard at midnight, among the white foam of our ship's track, and vanish, forever and ever!' `Overboard, a second time?' said Loena, with a perplexed and bewildered look, which instantly cleared up, as she asked him eagerly, `when this was? when he leaped overboard?' Harold told her, to the very moment; the year, and day. `O, heaven!' cried the Indian girl, with a look of rapturous acknowledgment—`kneel down with me this moment, Harold! O, thou hast much to be thankful for—yes, yes, kneel dear, the living God is about to bless thee! and thou too, woman of the mighty heart, awake, awake, and kneel with us—the man that you weep for, is alive!' `Who? what!' cried Harold. `Oscar! Oscar himself is alive, at this moment, I have no doubt, for he survived his mad plunge. It is not long since we met. Look to the lady!' `Art thou mad?' cried Harold, putting his hands, terrified and trembling, upon Loena's brow. `Mad! mad!' answered Elvira; `who is mad? Oscar, where art thou? Come to me, love—is the foam over thee? I will wash it off—the sea-weed binds thee, dear—my hands shall untangle it—Is thy hair frozen and matted? O, I will thaw it in my bosom—come, Oscar, come to me, love. Where art thou? O, speak to me! O, yes, yes, yes, I am mad, very, very mad, and weary, and wretched—O, I would give the world to die—but no!' she added, rising up and standing apart, unaided, and alone, with unconquerable, and irresistible majesty and self-possession—`No! I am not mad!' `Harold,' said Loena, catching the awful spirit that illuminated the countenance of Elvira, `the man Oscar is living—the assured resemblance of thee, older, by many years, scarred too, and—' `Scarred!' cried Elvira, relaxing a little in her stature, and trembling as she leaned forward, with glittering eyes. `Yes, Oscar, he who leaped overboard, at midnight, on seeing the spirit of his beloved, his own Elvi—gracious heaven! how blind I am of late—art thou that woman? so proud! oh, thou art an enviable creature! Yes, yes, thou art that cruel, majestick woman, that wrecked the brain of the bravest and best of men— sent his great heart a wanderer, among the bleak and barren places of the earth. Oh, can it be, art thou truly his dear, dear, dead Elvira?' `Yes, I am she. He had reason to believe me dead —reason enough, for I fell once, by his own hand. But go on, go on, I do not believe thee, yet I do love to hear thee talk of him, go on.' `I will. Heaven! what miracles are these—dead, dead, both of ye, and yet, but no matter. He saw thy spirit, he says, but he never spoke of his brother, never!—it is very strange.' Harold interrupted her here, for a moment, and explained that fact; (and the reader will recollect that they were not known to each other at the time when they met.) `It was a very dark night, was it not?' `It was—just before—and afterward—'said Harold. `Well—the spirit passed before him, he says, and beckoned to him, and he followed it, walking awhile on the water, as it appeared to him. The vessel ploughed away upon her course; but whether it was, that the sudden shock of the cold water, as he plunged into it, or that the loss of blood, which followed from a severe blow on the temples, which he received from some floating wood that passed him, (probably thrown over from the vessel, in the alarm that followed,) restored him to his senses, he knew not, but he could not have VOL. II. 27 been in the water long, a few minutes at most, when the spectre vanished, and flashes of fire went over his face, hot and scorching, as if the surges themselves were lava. A preternatural terrour of death arose, at the same moment, and he gasped, and gasped, in horrour and distraction, until he found that he was sustained by something, which he had grappled at, in his delirium. The ship was still in sight; but the clouds fell down, like a curtain, between her and him; and he floated about, until, immediately after daylight, the next morning, when he discovered a vessel, lying to, at no great distance, with several boats out, fishing. He was discovered, taken on board, and carried into Dunkirk.' `He has often described his feelings to me, until the sweat stood upon my own forehead, as I listened to him. At one time, he says, that he distinctly felt the weight of a heavy, great hand, pressing upon his head, and others plucking at his feet, in the water. He strove against them both, and shrieked, and God heard his shriek; and the next time that he looked upon the ocean in quiet, it was a mirror of steel, stained with a shadowy crimson, and undulating beneath the most beautiful sky that mortal ever prayed to. It was all round and about him; and the white winged ships, like some swan-like creatures of the bottomless water, and blue sky, were constantly emerging from the horizon, coming out of the very air, it appeared, spreading abroad their beautiful pinions, and sailing about, in the wind and light. Ship after ship went by him, thus: and all was so calm, so beautifully calm, with the wavy gold, and crimson of sunset, flowing about the smooth water, like coloured shadows, that every substantial thing stood and moved like a portent, in its solidity and blackness. But, why dwell on this? only because the emotions which arose in his heart, the noblest—bless me, Harold, how pale you look—surely no—I will not believe it—but thy brother had the noblest heart, except thine, there!—will that do? that ever beat. These emotions were the beginning of his reform. `He came to Paris. I saw him—it was a singular adventure, and, some day or other, I will relate it— but—' `Nay, Loena, now if you please, there never can be a better time,' said Harold, with a little seriousness. `Very well: It was at the opera. The count was with me. He had just been wounded in the sword arm, and was, nevertheless, deliberately affronted by a young officer, who did not know him, it was evident. The count's eyes flashed fire, and I saw him place his hand upon his sword.' `I am wounded, sir,' said he, `or I would chastise you upon the spot, for your insolence.' `The other bit his lip, scornfully, and turned upon his heel. `Your name, sir,' said the count, at the same moment handing him his card. The latter was enough— the other turned pale, at first, and then red. `Sir,' said he, haughtily, I mistook you. I beg your pardon—but—(with a significant look, which made me tremble in every joint,) you are so well known for an accomplished swordsman, that I cannot make any satisfactory apology to you. You will perceive why. I shall see you to-morrow. `As he said this, he was turning to depart, but was arrested by some person, who lifted his head slowly in the light, saying “`Boy!”—and then stopping abruptly— `The officer's lips quivered, and it appeared to me, that he was struck with terrour;and he paused, as if rooted to the spot.' “`Go this instant, sir, and beg that gentleman's pardon.” `The officer obeyed, mechanically, faltered out a few words, but was so blinded and choked with some sudden passion; (for the moment he had commenced his apology, he seemed suddenly to awake and wonder at himself) that he turned, his cheeks glowing with shame, and the tears gushing out of his eyes, and struck the stranger to the earth.' `That stranger was Oscar. He arose deliberately— my eyes were rivetted upon him, I knew not why then, but now I believe that it was his resemblance to another.' Harold smiled. `The other ladies fainted, but I looked on. He arose deliberately, followed the young man out, and, as we heard the next day, disarmed him, broke his sword, and sent him home, for the second time, humbled to the earth. Nay, a gentleman, who was present, related the affair to me. He said that the first thing which struck him, was the coolness of manner, and the settled darkness of eye, in Oscar, as he came upon guard. Next, the astonishing quickness, precision, and entire correspondence of his eye and hand. And finally, the melancholy tone of his voice, as he stopped a moment, before the deadly aspect of his young adversary, his lids glittering with compassion, in the lamp light, beneath which they fought, and said to himself, `nay, nay, I will not kill him, it was a blow, to be sure, but then, he is young, and very brave, and I must not kill, no—no, no, it is a childish affair.' `At that instant, the sword flew out of his adversary's hand, and Oscar's point was against his breast.' `The sword was broken, and the young officer, too passionate to speak, departed in shame and terrour from before him.' `Had the sword been shattered in his hand by a thunderbolt, it could not have been more unexpected and sudden to us, or to him,' said the gentleman, who informed me. `And I afterward found that Oscar had been set upon, some evenings before, by several young men, in a frolick, four of whom he had compelled to leap into the Seine, and the fifth, whose life he had spared, was this very officer. At any rate such was the story.' `But when did you see him, dear Loena, when, tell me?' said Elvira, faintly, as if just awaking from a long trance. `About six months since; but, stay, he was then coming home, for the second time, and, I dare say, is hereabout, at this very moment.' `What mean you,' said Harold, `by the second time?' `Nothing more than this—that he is subject, or was, until within the last two years, to fits of derangement, in one of which, he says that he has reason to believe that he visited the home of his childhood, for, when he recovered, he found a dagger in his possession which he distinctly recollected having left upon his table— and—' `By heaven,' cried Harold, kissing her red lips, in a transport, `that was the only thing that troubled me on earth: to have that explained, I would have gone through fire and water; I was sure that my senses could not deceive me; oh, I am rejoiced, indeed I am. Ah, Elvira, look up, love—my friend I mean—this only was wanted, to complete our happiness—we must all meet again, we shall!—oh, do not weep.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. Three weeks after this, Harold had good reason to believe that Oscar really was in England. How his heart swelled. Loena was weeping with joy upon his bosom, and Elvira stood by, like a queen, in her power and solitariness. `Do not go,' said the latter, as Harold prepared to go again, where he had reason to expect intelligence of Oscar, `do not go, at least, not yet—I know not what I say, but, thy brother and I are strangers, forever— must continue so, unless—' `Well,' said Harold, `unless what?' `Unless—' she replied—`I tremble to pronounce the word. My fate is on it. I am not superstitious, but some calamity, I do feel assured, is about to befal us. My brain is so racked and swayed by distracting emotions that I have not left the firmness, that is necessary for this trial—indeed I know not what I was going to say.' 27* She pressed her hand to her heart, as she said this, and her eyes grew strangely dim, and her parted lips vibrated with a quick motion, as if her breath were drawn through her heart; nay, for a moment, she looked like some lovely thing, in the extremity of her awe and sorrowing, suddenly chilled to marble, while the words trembled in broken, inarticulate murmurs, like inward musick, from her open mouth, and her motionless hands were pressed upon her poor heart—the haunted cavity, tenantless now, and desolate—dark and silent, to all but the spirit of other days, and his sweet ministering. `I must be plain,' said she, at last, `if Oscar be indeed alive, and if he be that Oscar, the same that I have known, our fate is sealed. I care not then, how soon I go to my long home,' (the tears rolled down her cheeks, as she continued,) `nay, even now, my brother, for oh, thou art my brother, the brother of a broken hearted woman—I could lie down upon my death bed, and weep myself away to my last, last sleep, with a feeling of unutterable delight; and oh, if it were meet for me to die, how devoutly would I kneel down at thy feet, my brother, and pray for death, at this moment.' Harold caught her thin, weak hands and pressed them to his lips, while his tears fell upon them, like a shower of cold rain; and his Indian girl wiped them off as they fell, with her beautiful thick hair, and kissed her again and again, on the forehead, lips, and eyes, sobbing herself, all the while, like a distracted creature. The door opened. A stranger walked into the room. It was twilight, but he was not to be mistaken. The Indian girl shrieked, and ran forward to meet him; and Elvira sank down, in silence, powerless, and motionless, upon the floor. But Harold, heedless of aught but the majestick presence before him, leaped forward, and extended his arms. They embraced, and parted, and the stranger, motioning the others to depart, was instantly left alone, supporting the lifeless Elvira upon his knees. Did his touch thrill so sensibly? why then, lifeless as she was, did her flesh tremble, when he laid his hand upon her forehead? She opened her eyes, gazed upon him, until their insupportable dimness made his brain reel, and his heart sicken, and then he murmured her name. She showed no symptom of recognition, but continued gazing upon him for some minutes, like one that studies the chart of a country defaced by continual storm and irruption, earthquake and inundation— `Surely,' said she, at last, `surely,'—putting back his hair, and looking into his eyes, with an expression of reviving intelligence, and then over his forehead, where the most tremendous inroads of passion and suffering had been; but the stranger faltered not, a little paler he might be, but it was evident that he was waiting for some symptom of recognition, before he told her what he felt, that he was a dying man, and that his heart too, was in decay. Her colour came at last, like a flash of fire, over her whole face, and she faintly repulsed him; but the effort was too much for her, and her head sank upon his bosom, and the stranger's cheek was thrilling with the touch of her mouth, as she murmured his name, from the deepest place of her whole heart, and gave herself up, entirely, and forever, to the tenderness that gushed after it. `Oh, Oscar,' she repeated timidly, again and again, while her half shut eyes glittered through their tears, like some dark flowers, opening in the dewy starlight and shadow. Oscar arose, and Elvira leaned upon his bosom. His tread was still undaunted; and there was a sternness, a sort of reality in his outline, somewhat intimidating, perhaps, to the visionary and passionate, but not so to Elvira, not to the heroick and sublime. Here Harold broke in upon them again, his heart leaping from his fine eyes, and Loena clinging to him. But Oscar appeared to shrink from him, not haughtily, as he was wont, but doubtfully; and when he spoke to him, it was in a voice so deep, so melancholy, that the blood ran cold at the sound of it. `Who art thou?' said he, `what is the meaning of this? who art thou, young man? by what right—' `Still so imperious!' said Elvira, `he is thy brother.' `My brother!—how!—' (a rapid, slight convulsion passed over his face,) `where am I?' he said, as he gazed upon Harold, who stood awestruck and abashed before him—`at first, I embraced thee, I know not why. Thou art a stranger to me—and yet, thou seemest—art thou not? some spirit that I have dreamed of in my delirium? nightly, yea, nightly, for many a year of sorrow and wretchedness, in the misgiving of my heart, and desolation of my soul—hast thou, or has thy visage, young man, haunted me. Art thou indeed my brother? Speak! What means this yearning of my heart? Speak to me. Whence this mystery? Have I approached thee too haughtily?—Forgive me, thou knowest not how much I have had to make me haughty. Oh, speak to me—but—maybe thou art a spirit, and she, too, and she, wretched Oscar! Why do you not speak to me? What have I done? Shall I be as one of you? But give the sign, and lo, I am disembodied like yourselves. Oh speak to me. I want a brother. I have always wanted one—tears!—nay then, ye are living creatures —forgive me, I entreat you. What have I said to you? Nothing unkind, I hope.' Here he fell upon his knees. `Father,' he cried, `forgive me, I am very wretched; thou hast visited my transgressions upon me, in mercy —and—' Elvira stood breathless, with all her faculties spell bound, before him. And Harold, too, stood still, still as death; not a muscle moved at this adjuration, not a nerve trembled. `Arise, brother,' said he, at last, in a firm, low, but distinct voice, full of manhood and self possession; `arise! Thou art my brother. I am thine. Thou art proud, it seems. So am I, very proud. I have thrown myself upon thy bosom—thou hast thrust me from thee —no matter, I forgive thee, I have learned to forgive men.' `By heaven,' cried Oscar, leaping into his arms, `there spoke the blood of Salisbury. Thou art my brother! I am sure of it! I glory in thee. Thy voice, thy look, thy emphasis, are all of my father. No other man on earth ever spoke, or looked, or acted like him. What is thy name?' `Harold,' answered Loena, quickly, her countenance flashing with vivid and intense delight. `Harold,' said Oscar, `why that seems strange. I once knew, or thought that I knew, a man of that name, but where it was, or when, I have forgotten.' Harold interrupted him, and told him where it was, and how it terminated; and his brother's face clouded, as he went on, till his eyes shot lightning. `Yes, yes, I remember it now; oh, I was a madman then; it is all here, here, burning and whirling yet. But no more of this—I thank thee. I acknowledge thee. I have now a brother. I am not alone now, not quite alone, in the wide, bleak world. Let us kneel.' He knelt; and who could resist the temptation to kneel with him? He bowed his great forehead, and there was in that very movement, so slow, and reverential, a something so awfully impressive, so august, that, without uttering a word, all felt the unction of a truly religious spirit, a presence of devout sincerity doing, like some high priest, his appointed and acceptable service, in silence and mystery. Not a word was spoken, not a single word, but the whole four knelt together, and arose, with an unspeakably deep religious feeling, to the expression of which, no form, no words would have been competent. `My brother,' said the stern, implacable man, as he arose, with his eyes clouded, `my brother, I am happy. I am forgiven. I feel it here. I am ready to die now. I care not how soon I go to martyrdom.' As he said this, he turned, with a majestick step, to depart, but his course was impeded by Elvira; he extended his hands, and his very fingers shivered with a mixture of passionate delight and horrour. He was cruelly disturbed, that was evident, and he undoubtedly took her for a spirit, as he dashed away the tears from his eyes, and addressed her in a broken whisper, as if afraid that, at the sound of his voice, she might vanish. `Still there!' he said, `still there; oh, Elvira, just as thou stoodest once upon the waters.' Elvira reached out her arms to him, and Oscar, poor fellow, in the reeling of his brain, and the wild rioting of his heart, approached, with his arms as wide apart as he could hold them, as if he caught at some sweet, airy mockery, that he knew would disappear. But he caught a living woman in his embrace— `Alive! alive!' he said, shuddering, passing his damp hand, first over his brow, and then over hers, as if to assure himself that, whatever they were, spirits or substantial things, they were alike. The thought seemed to give him pleasure, and he smiled. `But what art thou, dear?' he said, pressing her temples with his fingers, and gazing on her shut eyes `do not let me wake; cheat me forever, and I will forgive thee for all, and I have suffered much—oh, my brain! Thou'rt very like her, that's certain, but not so young; no, no, not so very young and beautiful, but more majestick; say, dear, what art thou—poor dead Elvira.' Elvira opened her eyes again, at the sound of her own name; and, in the delirium of her heart, caught the hand which yet rested upon her temples, to her lips, and kissed it eagerly. Oscar almost plucked it away from her—`Woman,' he cried, sternly, `what art thou? wouldst thou tempt so dreary, so desolate a heart as mine? Nay, nay, do not weep, I meant not unkindly, dear; and thou art so like my poor girl, that I am sure she would forgive me for loving thee—I do love thee, I do indeed, child—Ha! her very eyes, open them upon me, again, love. Indeed, indeed thou art marvellously like the only human creature, whom I never spoke or looked unkindly to. Didst know her? She rifled my proud heart, scorched my brain, scorched it to cinders, plundered me of all my treasures, reason, goodness, religion, and left me—what I am—a maniac, a murderer! — — — — — — Oh God, have mercy on me! But yet, unkind Elvi—yes that was her name, I can bear to speak it, I'm not afraid, no, I will speak it—Elvira! there, was it not bravely done?—yes, her name is still dear to me, very dear. Why lookest thou away from me? Didst thou know her? I'll swear thou didst, for thou hast caught the very motion of her lips, the languor of her look, the—the innocent tranquillity of her whole countenance. And oh—I cannot spurn thee from me, thou tempter, I cannot, as I would and have, every woman that hath breathed upon my cheek, since Elvira touched it — — — — — — yet, yet, do not weep—farewell; I cannot love thee, farewell.' He stopped a while, exhausted, and then recommenced, in a tone of more thrilling tenderness, and melancholy. `No, there was only one, one, on the whole earth, of all the countless myriads that heaven hath thrown in my way, only one that I could love, and be beloved by—and she, she hath forsaken me. Thou lovest me, blue-eyed woman; I see it, I were no mortal not to see it, but beware, thou wouldst abandon me too—thy swimming lids—thunder and lightning!' (He shrieked aloud, covered his face with his hands, and suffered Elvira to fall at his feet.) `Merciful God! where am I? what new dream is this? where am I? in the dominions of heaven or earth? what art thou?' he added, firmly grasping Harold, who, incapable of resistance, from the suddenness and unexpectedness of the attack, shook in all his joints, as if he were in the paws of a lion, `speak! I will be obeyed. Who hath planned all this? You would drive me mad? wreck me anew, ye cruel creatures, soul and body, forever and ever—plunge me again, up to the eyelids, in hot blood, hot! hot!' Here Loena interfered and, with a manner, that showed her to have been familiar with these moods, laid her soft hand upon Oscar's brow, until he gradually relaxed his iron hold of Harold. `Be calm, my preserver,' she said, `oh be calm, be thyself again. Remember thy vow. Unbend thy forehead. Call up thy noble faculties. That woman—nay, look upon me more quietly—now for the trial of thy manhood—art thou prepared?' `I am,' was the reply. `That woman then,' said she, `is Elvira.' A silence of some minutes followed, which was broken by Oscar himself, who observed, in a calm, dispassionate tone, as if bewildered: `I cannot understand. There is a period of my life, that is a blank to me. It is all—darkness and delirium; what happened then, except at intervals, I know not. But I have a terrible, indistinct recollection, that Elvira is no more —that—' (he shuddered, and his very teeth rattled,) that—I murdered her! Did I! Tell me the truth. I can bear it, believe me. It has been a life, this of mine, all of shadowy dreaming, fire and smoke; and, in my memory, all substantial and beautiful things hold an uncertain place. Give me time to think; this lady— no, no, I will not speak of my beloved in such words. I will believe thee, I will—there.' As he said this, he approached the insensible Elvira, and pressed his lip to her forehead. `There! I acknowledge thee, dearest; by that kiss, I wed thee, love, living or dead.' She moved. `Ha—living!—awake then, awake, love—give me our ancient pledge. Then shall I know thee, indeed.' Elvira had just life enough left, to lock her hands together, and place them in his. `By heaven, it is true!' he cried, the tears gushing out of his very heart, for the first time, almost, in his whole life. `Thou art indeed, my Elvira! mine own! I believe thee now. No mortal can make me doubt thee!' Now then was Oscar happy beyond the reach of vicissitude or calamity. He was still beloved—still! and forgiven too! The woman of his worship was in his arms. She whom he had so long loved; so secretly too; had loved him as long, and as secretly. True, they might die. They might be torn asunder again. Again, she might banish his heart, like the dove—shutting up the only ark upon the face of all the waters, to which it could return— but no human being, no, nothing in heaven or earth could alter the past—the assurance of her love was like a fresh fountain, springing out of a barren and rocky desert to him in his journeying. He had tasted, and lain himself down by it, willing to die, ere his thirst returned. O, he was happy! Had she not locked her beautiful hands together, and renewed the pledge of mystery and love? Let us leave them. It were vain to dwell upon such scenes. The full heart, filled to repletion, to bursting, with unutterable thought, must be left to repose and languor. Go ye to your dreaming then, ye that have loved; go, and dream anew of your dearest one—the touch of lips that thrill—the glance of eyes that weep for rapture—the sound of a voice that murmurs, like the musick of a broken harp swept by the wet wind—go, and dream of tears, and whispers, and intertwining arms, and half-closed eyelids, and the innocent surrendering of your whole heart and being to that beloved one!—Go, and believe, as you sit together about the family hearth; as you worship together at the well-known altar, where every thing breathes, and sounds, and touches of the friend that you have lost— so hallowed by ten thousand sweet and solemn recollections; so mournful, so tender, that you learn to believe that the dear spirit is forever about you, forever near you; watching with you; listening to your voice— gazing into your eyes—worshipping with you—and then at night, too, when you are helpless and alone, to believe that all that you have loved and lost, are tenanting your apartment, and praying over you—go—Go to your dreaming, ye that have wandered, and be forgiven again! Go, and be restored again, to all that you have lost. But beware how you awake! O, it is no light matter to awake from such dreams—such! with the tempter at your elbow, and the means of destruction at hand. O, God! is it not?—to awake with the cold tear upon your cheek, the tear that was warm VOL. II. 28 but a moment before, and flowed from your overcharged eyes, in the fullness of your joyful dreaming!— to awake, and outstretch your desolate arms toward the untenanted pillow at your side—to turn to it, with your heart heaving, and away from it again, as if struck with sudden death—to awake, ere the palpitating of your breast hath ceased—with all your arteries tingling, and your temples sore and aching, with the trance into which your dream had plunged you; and find it all cold and dark about you—O, there is no death so terrible! Woman! look at me. Hast thou never dreamt of starlight, and musick, with all the innocent revelry of the heart? Dreamt that some dear one was weeping upon thy lips—and awoke—alone, all, all alone, within the four walls of a dark, solitary chamber, with perhaps no other living thing awake, in the whole world! Angel of dreaming, why art thou our visitor? Is it in mercy? or comest thou, like the tempter, to make men mad and blaspheme, in the suddenness and excess of their disappointment? Why are they disturbed at midnight, with parting lips and closing eyes all about them? and then shaken, by fleshless hands, till they awake and find, that what they have dreamt of, are the lips and the eyes of the sepulcre! — — — — — — And now let us return again to our friends. Behold them once more in tranquillity—such is the reward of well-doing; such the operation of God's spirit upon the stubborn and vehement. Oscar's proud nature is bowed to the earth—he is now the very apostle of sorrow and humiliation. His high faculties, forgetting their imperial sway, are no longer blazing about, like the lighted thunderbolts of heaven, upon all that oppose him. No, but they are burning now with a quiet, mild lustre, like balls of pearl, with a coal in the centre. The fiery and impatient spirit of Harold too, is curbed and subdued. He is now another, and a nobler creature. The two brothers are christians now, as well as men; brave, cool, and wise: and even the untamed, untameable Loena, hath learnt to bear herself meekly, amid the encompassing brightness of HER destiny.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. `Farewell!—farewell!' Par pitié, laissez moi mourir!— `Brother,' said Oscar to Harold, as they sat together one evening, after a day of uncommon activity—`I have a great mind to pay a visit, myself, to America. Why, how your eyes sparkle! and to tread the very spot, of which I have heard you talk so much. What say you? and you? and you?' `With all my heart! and mine, and mine,' answered Harold, and Elvira, and Loena, all in a breath together—`nothing would be pleasanter,' said Harold, than to retread the haunts of my—my—' `Of your love—I know—out with it, brother.' `No; of my childhood, I was going to say.' `O, that's altogether the same thing, you know,' said Elvira, smiling, and faltering too, at the same time. `Make no stranger of me,' said Oscar, his dark eyes flashing fire as he spake, `I know it all, all!' (his countenance grew dark as he proceeded, and his voice deeper) `and brother, brother! I forgive you!—So—' (his face brightened)—`no more on that subject. Shall we go?' `Yes,' answered Harold, stammering, `I will go. I have many reasons. I so love that country, that, that, I do believe my bones would not lie quietly any where else. Loena loves that country too, and I hope, I hope that— Elvira has not forgotten it. My father died there— (he shuddered, and his voice was lost, for a moment, in the suffocating emotion that followed. `O, my brother, what painful recollections, what fearful and bloody deeds come over my memory again! Upon my word, I should quake now at the sound of our own war whoop.' `I know not,' he added, standing up, with the Indian princess at his side, their eyes glittering like dark jewelry—I know not if my heart will ever heave again, as it hath heaved, in the mountain air, when the shot rang, peal after peal, among the rocks—but shame! shame! everlasting shame on the wretch, born of the blood of Indians, wedded to the blood of Indians, who would not feel their war cry, when rightly awakened, thrilling along every fibre, vein, and artery! yea, let us go. The mighty men of America, our progenitors, are beckoning to us, and rebuking us. Our minds are dwindling here. We are here—O, what are we? useless and abject. Let us begone. There is our inheritance. There our virtues will have scope. Let us go, and be the friend of the red man. Let us go, and swear a covenant with the Indian God!' Oscar first smiled at his enthusiasm, and then hugged him to his heart. After which, it was soon determined upon to embark for the new world, not to `live, love, and die alone,' but to do their duty as men, and accountable men. A few weeks more, and they were upon their passage, the happiest human creatures in this world—feeling a reverential seriousness, approaching to melancholy at times, but never any thing like depression or sorrow. The ship ran her course merrily, and after a long, but very pleasant voyage, they arrived in America—that magnificent combination of all the elements: showing the earth, air, sea, and sky, in all their most wonderful exhibition—the— My history draws near the close. I have no heart to continue it. It were better perhaps to leave it here, and let the imagination of the kind hearted consummate the happiness that—but no. It must be told. It shall be told. I look over my papers, and struggle to postpone the catastrophe. But no, it will not be. The dying and beautiful tints of the olden time will not pass away, and they shall be perpetuated, though they be so, with weeping eyes, and a thick breath. Sometimes, there is a strange, vivid brightening of the past, under the vindictive blazing of my temper, as if some rude spirit had passed by the ashes of my heart, and unkindly stirred them, till the uncovered embers flashed up again, like the red light of ruin and desolation, which I have kindled so often in my boyhood. And then I see the whole air full of sword blades whirling and shining, and the whole sky is like the hue of some metal, burnished in an intense fire; and sometimes, while I am meditating, with shut eyes, upon the forgotten and absent population that have preceded me, to the congress of the dead—a little of the heart's own exhalation—an old man's tears will escape, and revive them all, like forms pictured upon ancient walls—and lo! the men harness themselves for battle! the horsemen of Israel, and the chariots thereof! the colouring waxes fresh; the waters flow, and the skies roll, and the green trembling garniture of the wood looks showering with dew—yes, yes, my history draws near the close. A little longer, and the garrulous old man will be gathered to his fathers, and forgotten. Will this survive? No! it were prodigal, indeed, to waste a hope on such a thought! Why am I so touched with melancholy? Why is my heart heavy, as if it had been listening till it ached, to its own musick? for the sick heart, like the mother, o'er her sick babe, will make a sweet mournful musick, for itself, at times. Can it be that I am parting forever, with the last friend of my solitude? This broken and long, long narrative? What wonder that I sorrow at the parting? It has been my only companion, for many a weary night, and when it hath left me, unless I may lay me down, and die immediately, unintruded on, undisturbed —I shall be very miserable. If I were young, with these feelings, I should have no wish to live, but as I am—O, may it please heaven not to leave me so utterly alone, as I shall be, when this is gone from me!— over this, I have wept; and what men weep over at my age, is apt to be very dear to them. Nay, my last tears; I am sure that they are my last, have been shed over it. I have knelt by it, and laid my two hands upon it, and prayed upon it, as Jacob did, upon the 28* head of his first born; and what old men pray over, cannot readily be forgotten by them; no, nor readily parted with. Yea, more, I have grown young again, at times, as I retrod the earliest scenes of my boyhood, cliff and cavern, hill and sky, wave and wood, in drifting rain, and wind, and snow; and my heart, my poor old heart —for shame—I will not—tears!—they are blinding— I'll to my task. `Harold,' said Oscar, after describing a strange, and terrifick dream that he had, the night before, to which Harold had listened, with an attention that was very alarming, `Harold I think that I could sketch the place.' `Do,' said Harold, reaching him a piece of paper; and after working a few moments, he reached it back to Harold, who, the moment that his eye glanced upon it, uttered an exclamation of astonishment—`That tree!— yes, I remember just such a tree as that, somewhere; but, for my life, I cannot tell where I have seen it. It is associated, too, with something terribly indistinct in my fancy, something that turns my heart cold, when I look upon it. But the rock, I know nothing of the rock; but why so melancholy, brother?' `I know not,' said Oscar, `but I feel a strange oppression at my chest. This dream has affected my spirits. Something—there—there it went again—but it is in vain for me to attempt catching it. Somewhat dark and threatening seems to be connected with it, and to me, appears continually flitting about me. Harold, do not smile, I pray thee. I am not terrified; but I tell thee, in all seriousness, that I expect some calamity to be near us. Nay, so distinctly, is that dream impressed upon my faculties, that, if I but shut my eyes, for a single moment, I can see the same dead body, gashed and bloody, lying in the cold moonlight; and hear the thunder break over my head again, like a discharge of musquetry, just as it did last night, when I awoke, bathed in my own sweat. Nay, when I awoke, I could have sworn that I saw the same body in my chamber, the blue water running at my feet, that tree making its wintry musick over me, and that great eagle sitting calmly on that rock, with his black shining eyes, and talons clotted with flesh and blood.' `No more, I entreat thee, brother,' said Loena, who had entered unperceived, and stood over against Oscar, as he related this, with a solemnity that made her quake, `beware of these fancies.' About a week after this conversation, Harold and Loena, and Oscar and Elvira, were strolling in the moonlight, at some distance from the house, and Elvira was pointing out the places of most interest to her. `What a beautiful scene,' said Oscar, in a low voice, pausing to show his awful sense of the midnight loveliness about him,' (for it was near midnight, but a summer sky, and so mild, that it seemed profane to shut it out,) `nay, why so fast? I like this seat; let us sit here awhile.' But she hurried on; and Oscar observed that Harold's voice became suddenly mute, as he passed it. `Elvira,' said Oscar, pausing, and laying his hand upon her shoulder, `what is the meaning of this? what has happened here? I know not what, but something, I am sure, has, for the changing colour of thy beautiful eyes, thy trembling—nay, I distress thee, dearest. Well, well, let us pass on, and I will never ask thee more, why thou didst so hurry athwart that shining and beautiful spot. I am sure that thou hast reasons, melancholy they may be, and tender, but good reasons, I am sure they are, for it.' This was said, but not meant, in a tone of tender reproachfulness. Elvira pressed his hand, and carried it to her lips. `I could not abide that spot, Oscar, for there I was faithless to thee—what!—drop thy arm, for that. Have I not told thee all—it was there, that I knelt to thy brother, barefooted.' `Thou didst!—oh, Elvira,' said Oscar, drawing her nearer to him for a moment, with suspended breath, `thou didst!—oh, how hard it is to forgive thee; but I do forgive thee, I do indeed. And so, thou didst love Harold.' `I did, from a stripling, a child. Why did I love him? I know not, or rather, I knew not then. But it was the unconquered, unconquerable fidelity of my heart to thee! In Harold, it renewed its allegiance to thine image—thine!—defaced, and banished, and broken. In loving Harold, I loved thee—and there, on that shadowed turf, by that rock, so high above all the earth, I most suffered, and therefore did I tremble, when I approached it.' Oscar turned and saw that Harold too, lingered, and that the dark eyes of Loena, radiant with tears, and spirituality, were lifted to the moon—her forehead glittered, and her parted lips, her smooth neck, and her swelling bosom, heaving with the exercise, and the night air of her own country, were all before him. At this moment Elvira turned, and begged Harold to lead homeward, `for the night was far advanced, and she was weary.' Harold obeyed, but in the intensity of his occupation, he walked forward, through a tangled and unfrequented path, without looking up, till he heard an exclamation of horrour from Oscar. He turned, and saw him standing, like a distracted man, and gazing upon a tree, shattered and peeled of its bark. One glance was sufficient, and Harold turned to fly from a spot, so terrible to his memory, when a loud groan from his brother arrested him—he was leaning upon the bosom of Elvira. `Away! away!' cried Harold, with a shout, as loud and distinct, as if there were the beleaguering of entwined adders about his heart, all striking their fangs into it, at the same moment. `Away! away! away!' answered the rocks above, in an unearthly shriek—like a line of challenging sentinels. But he could not stir, hand nor foot. There was the very rock—there!—even there, had he lifted his hand against his own father—there had his angry blood bubbled upon the wood—and there had he left him!—stripped, torn and prostrate upon the shattered rock, like some one, that had been shivered in a tempest, or destroyed by the thunder, plucked down upon his own head. `Let us begone,' said Elvira, `this must be the place that I mentioned—we may be the next victims, here, to this mysterious power, whatever it be that— ha!—what was that?' `The eagle, the vulture!' answered Oscar, wildly, looking up to where she pointed, `I dare say that she is there, with her clotted beak.' `It was there, that our father fell,' repeated Harold; and Loena, who knew all the circumstances, shook through all the pulses of her frame, at the mention of his name. Their countenances were sad, sad beyond the expression of humanity. It was the look of mortal apprehension and dismay; and Harold, as he gazed upon the blasted tree, felt his knees knock together. `Yes, yes!' said he, `there it is, just as I left it. But why did I not remember it, in the drawing? Brother,' he continued, recovering more command of himself, `brother! whatever were the sins of Logan, he was our father, and we must forget them. Let us go to his death bed, to that rock—I will lead thee to where he fell. Follow me—our beloved companions will stand here—follow me, brother; and, haply, we may renew there, with some hope of acceptance, our heartiest acknowledgment to HIM that hath turned our hearts, changed our destinies, and made the children of him, whose trade was blood, more peaceful and lowly of heart.' Here the moon shone out dimly on the left, and the water rippled coldly to the bank. `How like that night,' said Harold to himself, as they approached the tree. It was like that night; and he who had been there in both, would have forgotten, as Harold did, for a moment, all that had intervened, all! of toil, and agony, and humiliation, and suffering, as a dream. There was the same water, too, the same wintry blue—he paused to dwell upon it—there, too, the undulating outline of the opposite shore, so darkly and dimly seen, on that night of horrour, and there, too, the very shadow, out of which, the wounded horse emerged, snorting and plunging, when he swam to the shore—and there, too, the tangled branches, weighed down, and heavy with their load of matted wild flowers, perishing in their autumnal beauty—nay, was not that the sound of the young horse plunging through the wood!—by heaven the branches do rattle, and crack, and recoil, under the impetuous charge of something! A shriek! `Merciful God!' cried Oscar, `that was the vulture! —the same cry! the same! I heard it in my dream.' They stood together, and Elvira and Loena were with them, all trembling and gasping for the result— Harold and Loena were prepared—it was the voice of some wild beast, they thought—but his countenance was full of terrour nevertheless, for they were unarmed. The path was narrow here, and Harold stood upon the rock alone, for a moment, looking about. `For God's sake. Harold, do not—' Elvira was prevented from finishing her sentence, by the sound of a shot. The ball whistled past her, and struck the tree— but as the bark flew, Harold put his hand to his side, and staggered. The ball had gone through and through him. He reeled, raised his arm, uttered a faint cry of horrour, and pointed, with a convulsive hand, that dropped, the next moment, lifeless at his side, to the top of the cliff. There stood a gigantick figure, that clapped its hands deliriously, and shouted, in the voice that they had just mistaken for a panther's, with unutterable joy, as Harold fell upon the rock, the very rock, beneath the tree. `Seven! eight! nine!' shouted the giant. `One more, only one more,'—and he levelled his rifle again—but in vain, in vain, for Oscar, with the wrath and power of the waked lioness, smote his way through the wood, unarmed as he was, up the precipice, where the spectre stood, laughing, to receive him, grappled with him, and hurled him headlong down to the earth. But Oscar went with him. No mortal force could have released them. And there they lay, rolling on the earth, bloody and gasping, while Loena, who had stripped off her garments, was kneeling and staunching the wound of Harold, with her hair, shedding no tear, uttering no word, heeding nought of the terrible work that was going on at her side—and poor Elvira, she was senseless and motionless. Harold had just life enough to open his eyes upon Loena, with one look of dying tenderness and worship, when, by a glance of his eye, he beheld Oscar panting, with one knee upon the chest of his horrible enemy— he gazed a moment—rose, with a preternatural force, and shrieked out, as with his last breath, forbear!—and fell forward upon his face. Oscar arose, giddy and sick. Where was he? he knew not. And who was the savage? with whom had he battled? was it man or beast? It was overgrown with hair, and covered with skins—his eyes, too, were ghastly and red, emitting livid flames, as he lay upon his back, exhausted, but unrelenting, like a dethroned devil. He attempted to arise, but Oscar wrenched his rifle from his hands, and threatened him with the butt end of it. `Nine! ten!' said the monster, `one more, only one more, and what matters it who that one is?—Ha! what do you all here—one, two, three!—poh, poh—can't ye let a man die in peace.' At this moment Oscar turned his face toward him, in the full light of the moon, as he rested upon his elbow. `What! what! speak, speak!' cried the savage; his brow convulsed and working, and the sweat trickling down it. He then attempted to arise—his countenance changed—it took something of humanity, for a moment, together with an expression of unutterable horrour and affright; but was unable, and rolled over to Oscar's feet, with his face to the dust, and his eyes fixed, and staring, wide open. Oscar felt, for a single moment, touched with an unaccountable feeling of compassion. He raised the other, but only to be skaken off, like some unclean thing, as if the stranger's flesh crawled, at his touch. Nay, the stranger arose; arose, in his supernatural strength; and Oscar stood, powerless and quaking, before him, like a babe, a sick babe. Oscar attempted to advance—`But, no, no!' cried the terrible old man, in a voice of thunder—`no! off! off! leave me! seven, eight, nine! nine sons—judgment! judgment!' and turned to depart—but Oscar plucked him back, and then, with strange, awful eyes, ran to him, placed both his hands upon his shoulders; breathed quick and gaspingly into his face, and measured him from top to toe—his broad shoulders, his tread, all, became successive matters of astonishment, while the other stood motionless, and dark, and unresisting, under his hands. `Can it be?' cried Oscar, at last, in a voice scarcely louder than a whisper, while his face changed instantly to the deathlike hue of a drowned man. `George of Salisbury!' `Almighty God!' cried the savage man, `whence art thou? who of ye all! ye, ye bloody, mangled, murdered wretches—who of ye all hath dared to summon me?—who of ye? speak!—who of ye all hath right and power to commune with George of Salisbury?' `Tis he, by Heaven! my father! my father! my poor, broken-hearted, delirious father!' cried Oscar—`O, my father, look upon me, look upon me! I am Oscar, Oscar, thy first born!' `What! what! what!' said the savage—`Shadow! what art thou? Tempter, away! I know thee—thy haggard lips, I know it! Here am I, here, in my own dominion, and wouldst thou lie to me?—ha! ha! ha! no, no, poor innocent—eight, nine, ten—all here; well, ye are welcome—your jubilee, perhaps—a festival—ha! ha! ha! cold ar'nt ye? what business had ye with that rock? That was my throne. Another! so—what? are ye all come to the place of sacrifice?—well, ye are right welcome. No Indians among you? that is strange, but they were afraid to come here; that stone is stained with too red a dew for them. But who is that—a groan!' Here Loena stretched herself out upon poor, dead Harold; put her lips to his, once more, and never breathed again. `Who is she? and he? speak to me?' He lifted her up, and she fell lifeless at his feet; and then he turned over the body, and began to gaze upon the face of Harold, gradually sinking down, nearer and nearer to it, until, with a convulsion, and a cry, like some wild beast, strangling in his own blood, he gave up the ghost. And so Harold died; died on the very spot, where so many years before, he had wrestled in blood, with his own father. Yea, he died, and was buried beneath the very stone, upon which he had once offered up the sacrifice of two immortal souls, hot and smoking in blood, to the unstained midnight sky; before the very throne, and in the very presence-chamber of Jehovah. And the Indian girl—she was buried by his side— heart to heart; and her people, for all that knew her ancestry were her people, came and wept upon her grave, and their beautiful superstition taught them to see her, often and often, with a star in her hand, moving amid the clouds, arm in arm, with another, whose face was always turned to hers. The father too, the adopted Logan; the fell George of Salisbury—even he was buried among the bones, that, year after year, in his madness, he had heaped up under the soil, where he had once bled; under the very tree, which he had haunted with a spirit so deadly, that no passenger ever rested upon it as he passed by, without resting there forever—a place, which had at last become a terrour to the very red men, and was overgrown and tangled so, that the whites were fain to choose another route. Nine different persons had he slain there, and one of them was his own child; on whom, in the vivid, brief intervals of his reason, he had called, until the name of Harold was familiar to all the solitary places of the wilderness, and the tradition went abroad among the nations, that the destroying spirit who inhabited the place, was named Harold. No one ever knew how he had been preserved, or by whom; but he haunted the place and made it a desert; for ever and anon, some passenger, who chose the VOL. II. 29 river path, was heard of no more; and when sought for, would be found dead upon that rock, unrifled, but pierced through and through, with bullets, under the shadow of the blasted tree, and near the sweet, bubbling fountain, that had tempted him aside, for a moment. But by whom was this done? Nobody could tell. The place had become a solitude; and the Indian demons were believed to make it their congress. No living man dared to track it, at last. A new path was worn, and this, winding by the river, was utterly overgrown, by the luxuriant and dark beauty of the wilderness. Yea, such was the terrour of the place, that the very skeleton of the last, that had fallen beneath the accursed tree, lay there yet, undisturbed, just as it fell, with the flesh dropping off from it, piece by piece; and had not Harold been sentenced and doomed at an unexpected moment, the bony tenement, wherein a spirit like his own had once dwelt, would have rattled at the next tread of his foot! There it lay! ever there! just as it fell, unless, perhaps, in sport, it had been rolled from the rock into the mud, by the madman who inhabited the cliff. Ten thousand terrifick stories were related of the demon. He had been seen, where no mortal could keep his foothold, when the sky was all of a bright blaze; the thunder raging and rattling about his feet; his panther skin breaking and flouncing in the wind, like a heavy, tattered, black banner—nay, at midnight, in the stillest and holiest, the traveller would often hear the sudden ringing of a rifle in the heaven above him, and then the crackling of branches, as he turned and fled from the Evil spirit of the cliff. —But would that I had never begun this story—it is too melancholy, too sad—there were yet one pair of happy human beings whom I would—but no, I cannot —the truth must be told, even of them. Elvira had not told all—not all—though she might have told it, innocently—and it happened one day, when Oscar was leaning upon her shoulder, and holding her locked hands to his heart—that—no matter—her noble nature could endure it no longer, and she revealed the secret of her shame. Oscar heard her through—heard all her justification, but said not a word in reply—shed not a tear—put his lips to her forehead—it was the kiss of forgiveness and reconciliation; such as one would give a sister, that had been profaned—they moved; and Elvira thought that their motion was that of them that say, `fare—farewell—farewell for ever!' He never spoke again. His heart had been long in decay, and his brain too; and this was only a rude wind, that swept them both, like dust and ashes before it. He merely pressed her locked hands to his heart, lifted his dying eyes to hers, once more—and—no, no, I cannot forbear, lived and died a madman! and slept in the same chamber of death, with his beloved. Such was their bridal chamber—the place of broken hearts, and shattered intellects!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONCLUSION. I have now done. I am dying. I am an American. England! land of the noble and valiant, farewell! Thou hast wronged thy brave children of the west. Englishmen! Let me utter some plain truths before I depart. There are multitudes among you, who rank my countrymen with the men of Botany Bay, the refuse of your most degenerate and profligate children— multitudes, that have never heard of our revolution, and know nothing of our history, but regard us yet, as rebels. Men of England! Be generous to us. Glory in us, as we do in our ancestry—we were your youngest born. Believe not in your scoundrel politicians, the vile and abominable creatures of your corruption, out-numbering your good and great, as reptiles outnumber men. They have kept you ignorant of a people, that have changed the destinies of the world, shaken the foundations of your own empire, and filled the earth with republicanism. I am an American. I remember when first I set my foot upon your shores. Then was the name a reproach. Our Eagle too, was only a butt, for derision and ribaldry. How is it now? I have lived to see that name ringing from kingdom to kingdom—to see that BIRD breaking onward, through cloud and storm, even to the four corners of the sky. I am an American. But I know, and venerate a true Englishman. His heart was godlike, full of heroick thought, and high purpose—magnanimous by constitution, generous by birthright, brave by habit. But ye—O, ye are degenerate. It is now a part of your loyalty to revile America. Nay, your very ministry are stooping from their high estate, to blaspheme the destinies of my country. Hearken to your lying witnesses, with hearts of gall, and fronts of brass! Nay, some of your reviewers, men who affect to handle and govern secretly—the machinery of state—are they not drunk and delirious with arrogance and hatred toward us?—and there are your travellers too, a vagabond horde, wandering, like hunted convicts, over the face of our fair and beautiful inheritance, proscribed and interdicted by their very manners, from all intercourse with whatever is dignified, pure, or excellent; herding, when they get to America, with the outcasts of all the earth, the offscourings of all that is base and licentious, the rejected and disgorged of dungeons and galleys, bloated and diseased with spleen and envy, and re-absorbing in their contact with such detestable natures, all the bile and bitterness that their heart, sore with repletion, and festering with disappointment and corruption, have discharged—and, they, they are the men, to whom you trust for all that you know of a great and gallant nation! O, shame on you! Why, when you are sending whole classes of the learned and magnanimous, to all the corners of the earth, why not send some one to America?—who shall dare to dwell among us, till he knows us, and then dare to tell you the truth? Not that we want to be flattered, no! it may be well meant, but flattery is not the aliment for a nation, and least of all, to a nation of republicans. But this will not always be. I will venture to predict that you will yet do us justice; that you will acknowledge us, as we are, the strongest, (though boastful and arrogant) progeny of yourselves, in your Herculean vigour, when your nation was a colossus, reaching to Heaven, setting her foot upon the east and the west, and shadowing the ocean with her garment. Forty years ago—you must bear with me—I am on the threshold of eternity, and what I say to you, is said in the presence of the Almighty, nay, in the spirit of prophecy. Forty years ago, you employed generals and statesmen to destroy us, and they that were proud of heart, were handcuffed and pinioned to the service. But of late, you are served by volunteers, ballad-mongers, and blockheads. Then you caused power and character to advance against us—now, the lewd and puerile are detached for our discomfiture. You assail us with the sparkling nonsense of some poet, the lumbering detail of some farmer, or push forward the burning, acrimonious, and vindictive demon of Gifford; his cold, thick blood crawling, like a blind worm, through his palsied arteries, clotted and ropy with the venom concocted at the fountain—having all the shrewdness and foresight, and anatomical insensibility, but none of the holy probity of a Scotchman—hated, not for his strength, but for his disposition—the contempt of the magnanimous, and terrour of the feeble—his heart dissolving in the mortal poison of its own nature, with the sense of his solitude and desolation, encompassing him like death, and knowing that a vapour of repulsion is forever escaping from him in the fearful process of decomposition. Forty years have passed away. Great God! what a revolution! My beloved country standing up, with her forehead in the sky, her bright hair streaming from ocean to ocean—helmeted and cuirassed—starred and glittering with `intolerable light!'—and lo! her tyrant in the dust!— where is his manhood now?—where the presence, before which Europe trembled and was afraid? —he, before whose bidding, the Great Spirit of the ocean walked over it, from sea to sea, in earthquake and thunder?—and where the strong children of his youth? —the vast machinery of empire?—gone! gone! forever gone, in the retribution of the Eternal! You trod upon our shores, once—I have not forgotten it, and poured out your vials of wrath upon a poor, manacled, and bleeding people, till the very earth reddened to its centre, and armed men leaped through the smoke and flame of sacrifice, and rescued your victim, even at the altar. Forty years ago—but no, I must have done—the dream is passing—the last of its musick is now in my ears—a little longer, and I awake! awake! to what?—O, my wife! my babes! —Father of heaven! let not the curse of the widow and the fatherless—the broken in heart, and the wasted in spirit! O, let it not be cast up to this people, in their day of retribution! I forgive them—I do—I did not thnik that I could, but I do forgive them—my wife! I am coming, my poor, dear babes, I am coming! Englishmen! I have cursed you—I am sorry for it— I was sorry for it, even when I did it, but it was prophecy, and I was constrained to utter it—I now forgive you, and O, it may be, for my curses have been heard—that—in the tempest and wreck of your greatness, ye shall hear my voice! when the great God shall rain fire upon you, I will be there! When the earthquake shall upheave your proud cities, there will I also be; and there! when your great navy shall strew the waters, of all the earth, with its burning and blasted fragments, O, it may be that ye shall then hear my spirit weeping alone, amid the general exultation of the world, at your almighty downfal! Farewell! A DESCENDANT OF LOGAN. THE END.</field>
