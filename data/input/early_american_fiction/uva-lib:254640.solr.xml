      <field name="fulltext">BLANCHE TALBOT CHAPTER I. THE OLD BLOCK-HOUSE. The day closed, and the moon, which had been visible in the heavens all the long day, the pale and pearly-white ghost of herself, now began to brighten up her half-shield and lend its silvery radiance to the earth. The scene upon which she shone was varied and beautiful, and its enchantment was heightened by the soft lustre of her beams and the mysteriously comingled light and shade. A dark, transparent river flowed swiftly, and with many a flashing wave and sparkling ripple, beneath a double arched bridge that spanned its banks, uniting a pleasant town upon one side, with a verdant meadow on the other: upon which stood a Block-house and barracks half-buried in a score of majestic elms that grew upon the level sward. Close to the base of the old Block-house flowed past the deep current of the river winding just below it gracefully around a point, parting still farther below to embrace a little green island. From the banks of the river on the east side the shores went up with an agreeable ascent to a ridge half a mile distant, wooded with larch and oak, and over which wound the road which led from the bridge. On the west side, clustered about the bridge and climbing here and there the hill side, was the pleasant town above alluded to. It was over-looked by a dark-crested hill, which with that on the east of the river, enclosed the village, river, bridge and Block-house in a narrow but picturesque valley, about a mile wide. The river, after passing the Block-house and the village, made a bold course a mile below, wheeling around a rock known as `The Half-way-rock,' and which presented not only a striking appearance from insulated position at the extremity of a low beach, but from the the resemblance of its outline when viewed from up the river, to a human head. Now, in the moonlight, seen from the Block-house, it looked like a loaded barge coming round the point. A mile below this rock glimpses of the white fronts and gleaming roofs of another village could be seen, the gilded vane of its church kindled by the moonbeams to the brightness of sunny gold, and looking like a light upon the land. The river was without bark or boat in motion; but at one of the small piers of the town lay three or four vessels, dark and motionless; and at a little wharf just below the Block-house was firmly secured a small schooner with a swallow-tailed stern; but her sails were furled, and there seemed to be no one on board, though a large newfoundland dog was pacing up and down the deck with a regularity and gravity that had evidently been copied from the skipper, his master, in his watches. It was a summer's night and the air was soft and pleasant, and their was just wind enough in motion to cool the atmosphere. The whippor-will uttered his lonely cry from the covert of a willow that grew near the Block-house, and over the water the speckled night-hawk on arrowy wing darted after the sparkling fire-fly. With a deep, sonorous, but pleasing murmur came to the ear the sound of the rapids a mile above the bridge, the foaming wreaths which were constantly borne past on the surface of the dark river. The Block-house was untenanted, and stood solitary and deserted amid the scene. The oaken shutters of its windows were in many cases unhinged, and grass grew in the loop-holes and crevices of the logs. It was one of those early structures erected by the pioneers of the wilderness, both for the purpose of defence and trade. It was an eight-sided house, elevated ten feet from the ground, upon a square base of hewn logs, strongly secured, and enclosing a space which had no inlet from the ground, but was entered by a trap-door from the floor above. This enclosure was perfectly dark, and was used to hold stores and amunition. The Block-house proper was so much larger than the square of hewn imber which raised it so far from the ground, thal it projected six or seven feet beyond its walls on every side, leaving a broad shelter underneath from sun and rain. The only access to this upper portion of the edifice was by a ladder which was let down as persons wished to ascend, and drawn up after them. It had only one door and several small windows, and on every side was perforated with loop-holes for muskets. The roof went up into a point in the centre, and was ornamented by an arrow which had once been gilt, but was now nearly black with time and weather. The situation of this structure was very pleasant, being upon a perfectly level green, and opposite the village, with an agreeable prospect down the river. About forty yards in its rear east was a second building, constructed of hewn timber, with thick walls, two stories in height, and about sixty feet in length. This had been erected fifty years before, when the Block-house was built as quarters for a detachment of soldiers which were for some time stationed here to protect the settlers against the Indians and guard the river against the excursions of the English and Indian from the Canadas. But it and the Block-house afterwards fell into the hands of four traders who occupied it for some time, and more than once successfully defended it against the attacks of Indians, who tempted with the hope of plunder, combined together for its capture. But the soldier, the Indian, and the trader had passed away and the valley of the river smiled with harvests and the dwellings of civilized life. The old Block-house nevertheless remained a relic of the early times of the country, and seemed to stand among the modern abodes that surrounded it, like the old warrior-patriarch of the land. Although it could be converted to no use, the townsmen still let it stand, reverencing it for the memory of the Past; but the barrack-edifiee which embraced all the conveniences of a dwelling-nouse in its structure, came into the hands of a stout old sea-captain who had cast anchor there for life, after enduring the storms and safely passing through the perils of a long and honorable, and withal prosperous sea-life. The old barrack, though still something severe in its aspect, from the massive timber that composed its walls, had nevertheless lost much of its war-like exterior. It could be seen, even by the moonlight, that the hand of taste had been at work to cover and beautify its rough exterior. It had been white-washed, and shone like snow through the trees as the moon in glimpses amid the foliage of the old elms was reflected from its front; and a little yard had been enclosed by a low white palnig, and flowers were cultivated in it; and woodbine, honey-suckle, and the graceful vine of the mountain wreath had been laught to climb up the sides of the door and creep a-top of the windows, and to form a pretty net-work of tendrils and leaves, by means of guiding twine, over half its front wall. On each side of the door-step was a small vase, one containing a geranium in full bloom, the other gorgeously laden with an hydranger. It was very clear that there was some body else an inmate of the barrack besides the hardy, rich old sea-captain. But we will not anticipate our story. The moon had not been shining upon the steep, coffee-pot-like roof of the Block-house more than half an hour, leaving one half of its walls in deep shadow, when the sharp out-line of the shadow at one angle was broken by another shadow, which was plainly in motion and seemed to be projected from that of the building. At first it was difficult to tell what cast this new shadow, whether a human being or some one of the kine that loved to lie about the Block-house, around which they had all day cropped the rich grass. But the shadow, which at first advanced slowly and with an uncertain movement, at length was fully defined and proved to be that of a human being. No one, however, was as yet visible, for the angle of the Block-house concealed the person, whoever he was, and who had evidently just gained the top of the bank from the shore, and was now stooping as he advanced to the covert of the building. The shadow was at length lost in that of the Block-house, and the next moment a man appeared in the moon lighted space that lay between it and the barrack. He looked cautiously about him, and listened like one who fears he may be noticed and would escape observation. As he turns his face towards the river, he discovers the dark skin and flat features of an African; a discovery which the outline of his figure as seen in the shadow had very clearly promised. He was a short, bow-legged negro, with a broad back, very long and loosely set arms, and enormous feet projecting at the heel more than is usual with his race. He had on his head an old tarpaulin hat, wore a patched sailor's jacket, and a pair of breeches too large for his limbs. His legs, from his knees, were encased in long red stockings, and his feet were thrust into an old pair of white-topped boots, not a little soiled with age and weather. His age could not have been more than two and twenty, his features were large, expressive of good nature, and contented ignorance. Upon his back he bore a bag filled with some weight, beneath which he had staggered, and which had caused the erratic motion, and mystery of outline observable in his shadow. He now set the sack down at his feet, and taking a long breath, said, as he looked about him: `Dis am berry hard work for you Cæ sar, berry hard dis warm night. Berry steep bank dis ribber hab, berry much so. Dare de house ob massa cap'n ober dere, coz dis be de house on top ob anoder house, jiss as massa Archy 'scribe hime partickerly to dis nigger. He say, you come to a big rock, and hab face like man. I come to im rock, and see him face sure enuff, jiss like a man wid a nose on him head—it like to scare dis nigger, but I keeps dark and ses notin, and den pulls over to de oder side ob de ribber, jiss as massa Archy d'rect. Wall I mos up by,m by, comes to a leetle island, and I goes 'tween dat and de shore and den I passes a leetle pint wid an oak dippin' in der water, and den I sees de Block-house up on de bank jiss b'low de bridge, jiss precise as massa Archy say. Den I ties my skiff and takes my bag ob orange on my back, and climbs de berry steep bank, and sure enuff, here I sees de Brock-house settin' right on top ob anoder house, cny de top house mos' biggest. Dat am massa cap'n's house ober across de green, coz it answer perfect de scription Archy gib me. I hopes massa cap'n 'll gib dis nigger a horn ob grog, coz it sich a berry warm night. What roar noise dat? It sound like em airthquake in de West Indyz.' he cried looking round somewhat startled, as a stronger current of air bore to his ear a louder reverberation of the rapids above. `Hear dat bird keep gwain tellin me to whip poor Will. Dis nigger hab someting else to do, massa bird. Who dare? Dat be somebody comin' dis way Massa Archy tell me say noting to nobody, but jiss leave de oranges wid miss—no—wid massa cap'n, though I know de is for de young lady, and den go away agen tellin nothin to nobody as 'quires.' `Hulloah! who are you there? Stop,' cried a person who had issued from the bridge a few moments previous, and had began to approach the block-house, with an uncertain step, as if he hardly knew whether to advance or not; but as he got nigher, and discovered the negro, and saw him hurriedly about to take up his bag and retreat, he quickened his pace and called to him. Cæsar would have continued on towards the barrack with his sack once more slung across his shoulder, but the imperative tone and rapid step of the other led him to stop, and see what was wanted with him. What are you doing here?' demanded the young man, for he was not more than two or three-and-twenty, coming close to him, and looking him in the face steadily and scrutinizingly. `I'm ony takin' a walk, massa, by dis ere pleasant moonlight night. It berry pleasant.' `What is your name?' `Dat am berry ticklar kestion, massa,' replied Cesar, laughing good naturedly; `berry much so.' `I need not ask: you are the person I began to suspect. I know who you are. I thought I would know that figure anywhere: I am not mistaken. Where is your master?' he added in an under tone, `Who would have thought of meeting this fellow here!' `Cesar did not altogether like the manner nor the questions of the stranger, and when he said that he knew him, and then asked in a fierce tone after his young master, he began to put himself on his guard, and to eye him suspiciously; for the features of the new comer were disguised by a handkerchief, tied high above his chin and collar, and the low drooping of the visor to his cap. He looked like a person who did not wish to be recognized. He was tall and of good figure, and wore a shabby undress military coat, blue infantry pants with a white stripe down the leg, and at his belt hung an empty sheath, the sword being carried in his hand. This military costume did not surprise or alarm the negro, for the three year's war with England was just drawing to a close, and the roads everywhere were thronged with discharged soldiers returning to their homes; and so the military costume in the towns as the plainer coat of the citizen. `He know me, he say,' thought Cesar, as he tried to get a sight at his features, which the young man seemed to endeavor to hide from him by turning his face from the light; `I hab hear dat voice afore, and for de life ob me I disremembers where. It mont be in New Orleans or Boston, or de West Ingee. But it somewhere, sure; and I know if I hab seen him afore, it wont on a pleasant occasion, coz I kind ob feel it want, tho' I doesn't know xactly when nor where 'twas. But he sure be massa Archy's enemy, I tell dat by de way he ax ater him. `You have'nt answered me? Where is your master or whatever he is to you, Archer Worthington?' repeated the soldier, in a peremptory tone. `Is he in this country? Has he returned?' `Well, I don't know who dis gemman is dat axes so many kestions,' answered Cesar, moving on, and so I begs to be excuse from answerin' them. Dese is war times, and folk cant be too ticklar who dey talk wid.' With these words he moved on across de green. The young man advanced a step or two, and placing himself before him, said sternly. `Tell me whither you are going?' `Massa, dis free country, for nigger walk where he choose,' answered Cesar, very resolutely, and with a something in his tone that showed the stranger that it would not be safe to rouse his anger. `Cesar,' he said suddenly changing his tone, `I am a friend to your master, his particular friend? Seeing you here shows me that he has returned, and I am anxious to see him again, after his long absence. You ought to treat a friend and townsman of your master's more civilly.' `How you know I belong massa Archy? I nebber here afore? Where you see me?' `Where did I ever see you?' repeated the young man with some embarrassment, like guilty hesitation. `Yes, massa.' `Well, I dare say, I have seen you often before. Oh, it was in the South, I think. But, no matter. What have you in that sack?' `Oranges.' `And what are you going to do with them?' `Massa, jiss show me your face and eyes, and den, may be I tell you,' answered Cesar, in a tone as if he didn't like the way he was interrogated. `Indeed his liveliest suspicions in reference to the stranger were roused, and he made up his mind that, whoever he was, he was an enemy; and should, therefore, get nothing out of him. `You are going to that house!' said the man, pointing emphatically to the barrack, in one of the lower windows of which a candle shone through the leaves of the mountain wreath that trelliced the window. `I may go dar, and I may go odder whar,' answered Cesar. `Massa, please step out ob de way? coz people gets into diffikilties sometimes dat stands in oder people's way; and in dis case dis nigger no be sponsible for consequences.' `Very well, I'll remember you,' answered the young man, evidently suppressing his anger, and fearing to rouse the negro, whom he saw loosen a knife, stuck in a leather strap that hung at his waist. `Do you know who lives in that house?' he added, as he stepped aside. `I'll ax em when I gets to de door,' responded Cesar, moving on direct for the dwelling of the rich old sea-captain. The stranger stood and watched him, and saw him enter the little passage across the flower garden to the door, and knock at it. He saw a person—a female, whose face, seen by the moonlight, was fair and youthful, come to the the door, and beheld the negro place in her hand a note. He knew it was a note, for it shone white in the moon beams, as she took it. He heard an expression of joy, as it seemed to him, from her; and the negro with his sack was received into the house, and the door closed. `Fiends crush this Archer Worthington!' he muttered fiercely through his clenched teeth as he witnessed all this. `There is no doubt that he has returned—he and this infernal faithful negro with him, who, I wish, was in the bottom of the sea, ere I had ever met him. But he has not recognised me in my beard and mustache, and careful concealment of my features and voice. How strange that I should have met him of all others here to-night on this very spot. When I was crossing the bridge I saw the fellow land cautiously and noiselessly, as if he was at some mischief, and so excited my suspicions; and as he gained the block-house, even at the distance I was, I thought I recognised in his figure that of one familiar to me. And so it proved. His master must be in the country, and escaped after all. If so, then I am defeated on all sides. But I will not give up the fair Blanche as lost. She loves Worthington. That was clear to me from the first. and I have just had proof of it in the delighted exclamation that escaped her when she took the letter from the negro, and recognized by moonlight the handwriting. This shows she is familiar with it. I will wait and see this negro when he comes out, and he shall let me know whether Worthington has returned, or I will have his black heart out.' With this determination the young man drew back into the shadow of the projecting story of the Block-house, and there paced to and fro watching the house across the green like a wolf in an ambush. CHAPTER II. THE CAPTAIN'S DAUGHTER. Before we follow Cesar into the old barrack with his bag of oranges, we will introduce the reader into the little parlour, and unfold to him what was passing in the domestic circle, previous to his knock at the door. Old Captain Talbot had sat that evening in his door, in his leathern arm-chair, to see the sunset, and to smoke his evening after-tea pipe, according to his invariable custom every day. As the sun set, he looked at his barometer which hung up on one side of the door, and then glanced at his thermometer which was suspended on the other side; he then pulled forth his great old English silver watch and looked at that, and then made a brief seaman-like survey of the heavens, overhead and all round, as far as the roof of the house would let his vision extend. `A fine day to-morrow, girl! Barometer indicates fair, and the thermometer is just at 78 deg. where it was last evening at this hour; and this steadiness is a sure sign of a fine day to come! The wind is to the south west, about two and a half knots,' he added, holding up the back of his hand to catch the air, and then looking at the weather-cock on the top of the Block-house in front of him.— `We will have a brave day for our fishing trip down to half-way rock, so have all ready to start bright and early, by eight bells at the latest.' This was said to a young girl about nineteen years of age, with the most perfect face and figure poet ever immortalised in verse, or artist ever limned on canvass. Her eyes were a deep, celesial blue, the pure cloudless violet tent, that always indicates a sweet temper and generous heart. Her brow was open and fair as the lily, and her sweet lips were richer in tint than the crimson coral of the Moorish seas. Her eyes were not merely beautiful for their exquisite blue colour, but they were expressive of tenderness and feeling, and yet sparkled with the love of mirth, and the light of joy. She was standing in the door, just behind her father, looking through his spy-glass down the river, as if she were expecting to discover some very interesting object. `Every thing is ready, father,' she answered; `but I fear you will find me a dull fisher to-morrow.' `I'll teach you, girl. I'll make a sailor of you, yet. You can reef and steer my sail-boat now as well as I can, and better too, for that matter, for I am hauled into dock and out of repair. But what do you see below? You seem to have discovered a sail or some craft or other? You have been on the look out all this afternoon! What do you see, hey?' `Nothing, father.' `Well, let us go in! The sun is now fairly down, and my pipe is smoked out. This evening air makes me think o' the rheumatiz.' Thus speaking, the old sea-captain rose up, and leaning on the ready arm of his fair child, returned into the parlour and took a seat by the window, upon a well-stuffed easy chair. The daughter placed a cricket embroidered with her own fingers for his gouty foot, and then placed in his hand a little note-book, which he called his log, and in which he daily chronicled the winds and weather, the rise and fall of the mercury in his thermometer, and the state of his barometer. He now proceeded to make the usual record upon a leaf which had been ingeniously attached to the arm of his chair, to serve in place of a writing desk. Leaving him making his record, his daughter went to the tea-table, where sat a maiden aunt, the sister of the captain, washing the tea cups and silver spoons, for the good lady was the house-keeper, and mother—in kindness and love—to her beautiful niece. `Aunt, shall I help you?' she asked in a kind tone. `No, dear child! I have almost got through.' `Then I believe I will just run across the bridge to the Post-office. I heard the post-horn full five minutes ago.' `Five minutes, dear. It has then hardly got into the village, much more the mail opened. How very anxious you are to get letters the last week.— One would think your father or I was absent, and you were expecting to hear from us. Those are your scissors, dear, that you are snuffing the candle with, instead of the snuffers.' `Dear me. How careless I am!' said the laughing, blushing girl, for she had a rich colour in her cheeks all the while her aunt was speaking. `You know, aunt, the war is over, and one would like to know about the news of peace.' `That we shall get in good time.' `There, this is the fourth day the wind has been S.S.W. at sunset! Never saw it so steady from one point in the latitude before. Sign of settled weather! There is my day's work done up! Here, Blanche.' The maiden hastened to receive the `log-book' and pencil, which she laid over the mantle-piece upon a small shelf, put up for the purpose by the captain, who loved to have every thing as he said, `ship-shape.' `What is that you was saying about the peace, Sarah, hey? I heard you and Blanche talking.' `Blanche wanted to go over to the Post-office, and said she was anxious to know if peace was accepted.' `Accepted! Bless my timbers!— England wont dare for her own sake to refuse to ratify it. She is sick o' the war; for she has got more hard knocks than glory in it. Why she has been whipped every where on the sea, and half the time on shore. It has been a glorious war, and our gallant navy has gained glory enough for any nation. We can afford to propose peace. England will be glad to accept it. She wont look at the terms. She'll make her ministers sign without reading. I am glad the war is over, for we have had fighting enough, but it has done one good thing for us, it has shown John Bull that our success in the revolution wasn't by accident; for two accidents don't usually happen alike. After this, our flag will be respected, and I guess it will be a long time before a King's ship presses another American citizen. Have you put my spy-glass into the beckets in the companion-way, Blanche?' `Yes, father,' answered the maiden, who was standing in the outer door of the front entry, which the old seaman called the companion-way. `You'll take cold, Blanche, out there!' `No, father. It is a lovely evening. The moon is beginning to shine as if a silver shower was falling.' `Sixpences or Spanish mills, girl,' said the captain, laughing heartily.— `Well, you are right; when the air is clear and the moon is full, I've seen it look in the Southern latitude as if the atmosphere was full of silver dust. But there is dew on the moon-beams, dear Blanche. Take care of your health when you are young, and you will not need to be taken care of when you are old.— Where is Nep?' `He went down on board the Chebec with Jack,' answered his sister, as she placed the shining tea-spoons in a silver cream-pot by her left hand, not omitting, from habit, to count them first to see that none were missing. `Did you tell Jack about the bait and demijohn, and to put into the cuddy the things in the basket?' asked the captain. `Yes. All will be ready, brother, as you ordered.' `I saw Jack, father, and told him exactly what to do. He'll be up bright and early and dig the hait, and bend the sails and get aboard all that we need.' `That is right. It is best always to get every thing ready over-night. I hope we shall find salmon to-morrow, that you may have a chance to spear one.' `I spear a salmon, father?' `I'll teach you. You can do every thing else, and why shouldn't you spear a salmon. What are you putting your bonnet on for? Where are you steering now, hey?' `Just across the bridge, father,' cried Blanche, as she darted out of the door, and went tripping across the green; she had not gone twenty steps before there came, bounding and barking towards her, a fine large dog, the same we have seen an hour and a half afterwards, pacing the deck of the little shallop at the Block-house pier, like an old tar on his watch. `Ah, Nep, so you are always on the alert to go with your mistress,' she said, as she patted his noble head and caressed him. `Your master was asking for you, just now! Ah, Jack, well have you obeyed orders?' `Yes, Miss Blanchy, I has,' answered an old man-of-wars man, who came roll ing up after the dog to meet her; and as he spoke he touched his little, jaunty tarpaulin with a respectful air. `I've got the harpoon sharpened, and bent a lanyard on the grains, and I'm going over to the village store to get some sinnet to bend the hooks on with. But, Miss, the capti'n is fittin' out the little basky as if we was bound on the Georges a'ter cod! We ain't going only to fish in the river, be we?' `That is all, Jack. But you know father will have every thing just so. He says, you know, that there is no knowing what he might fall in with.' `Yes, Miss, I ha'nt sailed with the old gent'lum full and by for the last twenty-six years not to know his sailin' qualities, and just how he steers to a quarter of a pint! If you're wantin' any thing over on the street, Miss, I'll save you the trouble!' `Thank you, Jack, it is but a step, and I shall be over and back before you get through with your purchases!' With these words the maiden tripped on her way towards the bridge, followed by Neptune who had to trot to keep up with her. She soon reached the bridge, and was half way over it ere the old tar, who was a heavy sailor, came up with it. `Bless her pretty little heart! She sails just like one o' them Baltimore clipper built craft. What a neat, tight built, little barky she is. I wonder how old Captain Tom Talbot, with sich a ugly figur head as he has o' his own, and heavily timbered as he is, ever came to have sich a nice little quarter-boat as this Miss Blanche. She has eyes as blue as the sea off-soundings, and there is always a smile for old Jack sparklin' in em. God bless her and give her a safe voyage through this world into the anchoring ground above. If she han't got clear over the bridge out o' sight while I've only got abeam o' the toll-house here.' Jack kept on his way at his best pace and, as she said, he had even not got to the other side before she met him, holding in her hands two or three newspapers. He saw at once that she looked disappointed, as if her errand, whatever it was, had been unsuccessful. `Jack,' she said, touching him upon the shoulder, look sharply down the river!' `Well, I is, Miss Blanche. What do you want me to see?' answered Jack, leaning over the bridge railing, and looking as she directed. `Can you see any thing like a boat?' `Nothing in sight, Miss, this side the Half-way Rock.' `Well, I hope for the best! Come, Neptune!' said the young girl, hastening on over the bridge. `If he has not written he will certainly come! I will trust to that! But it is so late he can't be here to night. Come, Neptune!' she added to her dog, as two men passed her on the bridge. The dog came up and walked between her and the men, erecting his head and carrying himself with a menacing and proud look of protection. The men passed on, one merely remarking to the other, `That is Captain Talbot's handsome daughter. She needn't be afraid to walk out evenings with that dog of her father's. I'd as lief have a lion come at me!' Blanche hastened on, and soon reached the door in which her aunt stood waiting for her. `No letters Aunt,' she said, forgetting herself, and speaking out what was upper-most in her thoughts. `And who did you expect a letter from, Blanche? There is some mystery going on, dear, I fear!' `You shall know all in good time, Aunt,' answered Blanche, in a voice that seemed to be tremulous with anticipated happiness. Well, dear, I will wait your own time! Who was that who spoke to you on the bridge?' `It was only Jack, Aunt. He has gone to the street to make some purchase for to-morrow. Dear me! I really believe you think I have a lover hid away some where!' she said, laughing. `No, no! I don't think so! You know for that matter all is settled by your father's promise to the two young men. How singular it is we have not heard from either of them since they went away to the war, now three years ago! Well your time will be up in a month, dear!' `Yes, Aunt!' answered the maiden, dropping her eyes, and appearing a little confused, but rather with sweet pleasure than otherwise. `There comes Jack back again!' `I am waiting to see him. Have you got the newspapers in your hands?' `Yes, Aunt!' `Well, take them in to the Captain, for this is just the time he loves to have his papers read to him. I will give an order or two to Jack and then come in and hear the news too.' Blanche entered the little sitting roam while her aunt waited till the old sailor came across the green, when she called to him, and gave him sundry orders about household duties, for Jack was the general serving-man, hostler, boat-steerer, errand boy, gardener and footman of the captain's domestic establishment. At times he even assisted the woman in the kitchen in cooking dinner, on which occasions he acquitted himself with no little credit to himself. Indeed there were certain sea-dishes which the captain liked at times to have on his table, and Jack was always called upon to cook them, notwithstanding Mistress Sarah assured her brother that she had receipts for such dishes and could prepare them quite as potably as Jack. But the captain said that there was `a certain sea taste about Jack's duff, corned beef and chowders that no shore cooking by shore folks could get the hang of!' Jack having now received his orders from Mistress Martha, took his way down to the river followed by Nepture, who, when not attending on Blanche as her gallant, was the inseperable companion of the old tar, who had, as he asseverated, taught him all the ropes in `the barky' and to stand watch like a christian-man. The barky in question, towards which Jack now made his way, was a small pink-stern shallop of ten tons, belonging to the captain, and which lay at the small wooden pier below the block-house. It was schooner rigged, carried a flying jib in addition to her jib, and by the captain's orders Jack had rigged a gaft topsail aft, and crossed a yard for a fore-topsail; but the sail, which would not have been longer than a table-cloth, had never been bent. This little vessel which the Captain had built to suit his own fancy, was accomodated with a fore-castle just large enough to hold Jack and Neptune, and a cabin that four persons might sleep or dine in very comfortably. The cabin was neatly furnished with bird's eye maple pannels and mahogany transum, fitted up as a side-board with decanters and tumblers in beckets as in sea-vessels, though the barky had never smelt salt water. There were charts of the river hanging in the cabin, and overhead was a tell-tale compass. On deck there was a binnacle and compass also, though in a river not four hundred yards wide and bordered by bold and romantic shores, the compass was little likely ever to be called into requisition. But it was the captain's fancy: he would have it so, and that was enough. The name of the barky was `The Wind-Eater,' a formidable appellation; and not unmerited by her qualities as a close sailer. The name was also the captain's own fancy. Jack having passed the old Block-house, giving it a wide berth, for he faithfully believed it was haunted—he having heard, as he stoutly maintained, strange noises coming from it at night, as nothin on airth but some sinner's ghost could make!' Jack found, however, no one to believe him but the captain, who said that for his part he believed the old Block-house was more likely to be haunted than not to be; for from all accounts about spirits, they loved to stay about just such places. And then the captain would remind his incredulous sister of the tradition that one trader had murdered another there to get his money, and that all ghosts walked about the place where they were murdered till their deaths were avenged! This defence of his master confirmed Jack in his superstitious fear of the old Block-house. As he now passed it, Neptune went smelling round it, which quickened the old tar's apprehensions, and his pace, which was not a little accelerated at hearing the dog utter a low howl as he came away from the building. Upon reaching the shallop, Jack proceeded to get things ready for the early jaunt; and as the moon shone bright, he could see to work as well as in the day; and at length having bent on his fish hooks and got every thing prepared so that he should have nothing to do in the morning but bend the sails and get underweigh, he returned on shore to get his bai tready, leaving Neptune to keep guard on the quarter deck. The dog at once proceeded to pace up and down the deck with the gravity of Jack himself. CHAPTER III. THE NEWSPAPER. `Well, Blanche, child, what have you got from the office?' asked the captain, as she came into the parlour after leaving her aunt at the door. `Did my Boston newspaper come?' `Yes, father. Here it is, and the Portland also. Shall I tear off the wrappers?' she asked, as she took a seat, her usual seat by his side when she read to him; for though the captain's eyes were as sharp as ever, he loved to hear the sweet voice of his daughter falling upon his ear. In his opinion Blanche was the best reader in the world; and aunt Sarah said the Bible never sounded so good and holy to her as when Blanche read aloud, in that low tone of gentle awe and reverence with which she always read the sacred volume; for it was remarked by her father that there was a change in her voice, somehow for the better, wherever she read in the Bible. `Yes, you can read the news to me, dear. Now the war is about over there won't be so much as there has been and it is'nt time yet to hear whether the treaty of Peace is settled, and sent here to be ratified by us. We shan't hear about that for a month or six weeks to come; though at this season o'the year ships make short passages. I once come over in the mouth of June in '99, when I commanded the barque Constitution, in eighteen days from the mouth o'the Thames. The Boston paper first. I always flnd the latest news in the Sentinel. Uncle Russel keeps the old Columbian afioat and better manned than any other newspaper craft goin'. We need'nt expect to hear of any more brave fights at sea, girl. I hope we shall find out that for his last exploit they have promoted again that noble fellow, Archer, who has done himself and the navy such credit. We shall hear no more of his exploits now the fighting is over; though if the war had lasted three years longer he'd fight his way up to a Commodore's pennant. Look and see if you find any thing said about him under the head of promotions.' The maiden, with a flushed cheek and hands slightly trembling, unfolded the sheet and run her eye over the columns. She looked a little excited, but with joy within, as her bright eye wandered from columnn to column. `Ah, you have found that they have promoted him. I see it in the sparkle of your eye, girl!' said the captain, laughing. `Yes, sir,' she answered, with emotion that would scarcely suffer her to trust to her voice. `Read it. Why, dear bless us, the girl looks as if she was either going to laugh or cry. What else is there?' `Nothing, sir, nothing more, dear father,' she answered, with a smile, while tears danced in her eyes. `What the deuce is the matter, hey?' `I am so pleased, sir, that the young gentleman whose career, as given by the newspapers, we have, or you have, taken such an interest—in—has been, has been promoted. You know if he has friends, a mother or sister, how happy it will make them. That is all that is the matter with me.' `Well, you have always right feelings for every body. Read and let us see what they have given him.' She then began to read. `PROMOTIONS IN THE NAVY. `We are gratified to learn that the brave young seaman, William Archer, who was promoted to a midshipman's berth for his gallant and daring conduct in leading on the boats, and burning the English brig, George III., under the guns of the fort at Halifax, when the two officers in command of the expedition had become wounded and disabled, has been recently advanced to a lieutenancy for his courage in recapturing the American gun-brig Washington, after she had been taken by an English frigate and anchored under her guns, of which feat we have already given a full account in this paper.' `There. That is justice,' exclaimed the old man emphatically: `I am as pleased to hear that now as if he was my own son. The government have done just what they ought to have done. You look as if you were glad, also, girl.' `I am, father,' answered Blanche, with emotion. `Yes, you ought to be; for you and I, and sister Sarah have taken quite an interest in this unknown young man since we first began to read about him in the papers. Have you heard the news, Sally?' he asked of his sister, who at this moment come into the parlour, after having given her orders to Jack. `What is it, brother?' she asked, with interested looks, as she took her knitting from the drawer of a little table near the window, and sat down in her low rocking chair near it to finish a stocking she had nearly done, `What does the paper bring new?' `More about our brave young friend, William Archer.' `Then I shall listen with pleasure. Has he done any thing more to bring honor upon himself and his country?' `He has been promoted for his last exploit in recapturing the gun-brig. I knew he would be.' `I am delighted to hear it.' `I knew you would be. He is made a lieutenant of.' `Really, I feel as great pleasure at this as if I knew him.' `It would hardly please me more if he was my own son.' `Brother, is'nt it strange we have never heard any thing of—' `Of whom?' he inquired, as he saw his sister stop and look as if she had touched upon a subject she had not best pursue. `No matter now. Some other time,' and she glanced significantly at Blanche. `Oh, don't mind Blanche,' said the captain, `for I can guess what you were going to say, You meant the two lads who want to get her for a wife one o' these days. Blanche and I have talked over the very same thing, how strange it was we never heard of them since they left, except the report about Nelson Osborn's having been dismissed from the service, but which I could never see confirmed by the papers. Of Archy Worthington not a word has come to us.' `It is very strange, if they are alive,' observed Aunt Sarah. `Don't you think so, brother?' `Yes; for I had hoped that one or the other would have distinguished themselves sufficiently for their names to get into the papers, especially when they had such a fair prize to strive for as Blanche here.' `I thought we should get good news of young Worthington, at least, he sfiemed to be such a modest, quiet young man,' remarked Mistress Sarah, as she carefully took up a stitch too many that she had dropped in narrowing; `but I did not have so much faith in Nelson Osborne. Still they were both fine young men when they left here.' `Yes; but, as you say, there was more in Worthington to like than in Osborne; and I dare say Blanche thought so. But you need not blush, girl. They have been gone now three years without distinguishing themselves, and I dare say they will neither of them trouble you again; and I dare say you don't care a rope's yarn for either of them.' Blanche made no reply. She held the newspaper rather higher before her face than was absolutely needful; and if any one had peeped over the top, they would have seen that she was blushing and smiling, and looking as if she possessed some secret of happiness unknown to her father and aunt, which caused her to smile and blush so charmingly. `Come, Blanche, read the deaths and marriages,' said her aunt, who always took a particular interest in these items of news; while her brother, after the war news was read, cared most for the ship news and accounts of disasters at sea, and such like food for a retired old sailor's mind. Blanche read over first the marriages and then the deaths; and as neither contained names which the Captain was acquainted with, did not interest him; and, when she had got through, he bade her look at the ship news. This she turned to with more interest than she had shown in recapitulating the deaths and marriages; and her eyes running rapidly over the names of vessels, lighted on the name of one that arrested her attention and called up a look of pleasure. It was simply— `Sails to-morrow, for the Kennebec, the regular packet-schooner Augusta, for Kennebec, with full freight and passengers.' Her eyes glanced eagerly at the date, and then she seemed to be mentally calculsting something suggested by the announcement. The Captain for a moment quietly observed her manner and her absence of mind, and said— `What is it, girl?—anything squally, bey?' `What, father? Oh! no, sir! Nothing? I'll read the ship news. How forgetful I am.' `Very, Blanche. You've seen something there that you won't tell. Well, I won't ask you what it is. You are a good girl and will tell me all that I ought to know.' `It seems to me, brother, that Blanche has had a secret on her mind for some days past. There seems to be a something in her face that shows she knows more than we do about something or other, and I should like to know what it is.' `I dare say, Sarah—I dare say.— Never was there a secret yet that a woman did not want to know what it is,' he said, laughing. `But let Blanche alone: she'll keep nothing wrong from us you may be assured,' he added, as he saw his daughter's confusion and distress at this conversation. `You must not press her too close, sister. Young girls must always be expected to have secrets that old folks have no business to know. Come, Blanche, read.' Blanche felt very grateful to her father for these words; for she had indeed a secret that, for the present, she did not wish to reveal, knowing the proper time would soon be at hand. The Captain, although aware she had something upon her mind which she carefully kept to herself, and notwithstanding his own curiosity to know what it was, he sympathised with her under her aunt's inquisitiveness, and, as we have seen, kindly shielded her. Blanche, having read the ship news with a voice somewhat more tremulous than usual, her father took the paper from her when she had done, saying affectionately— `Come, dear, you can go now and finish the preparations for to-morrow's excursion. See that you put up a bottle of that old '99 Madeira I brought home in my last voyage, and two hottles of London stout, and tumblers and wine-glasses 2 to match. Don't forget to put into the busket the Spanish cheese, and a half-dozen of Boston ship-bread. We shall all have appetites on the water.— As for Sally, she can get ready her own sweet-meats and sweet-cakes, and sandwiches and such things; and don't forget the horn, Blanche,' he added as the young girl left the room with the hurried step of one glad to retreat; for the very pointed conversation of her aunt had greatly confused and embarrassed her; and she was grateful to her considerate father for giving her an opportunity to retire to recover herself, though he had not the remotest idea what could be the cause of her emotion. `Have you noticed how odd Blanche has been lately, brother?' asked Aunt Sarah of the Captain. `I have seen nothing in particular.— She looks sometimes as it she had a secret on her mind that was a dozen times a-day near escaping. That is all I see.' `And isn't that odd? What secret can the dear child have? I can't see; for it seems as though we knew every thought of her heart. Yet it is certain she has something she hasn't told us, and which I think you had best try and get from her.' `Not I, sister. Blanche is a good girl, and discreet, and can safely be trusted. I am not surprised at young girls having secrets from old folks, but I wonder how Blanche has got a secret at all, living so retired and quiet as she does at home.' `Certainly she has no acquaintance with any young gentlemen, or I might suspect it was a love affair; for she acts precisely like it.' `Does she?' asked the Captain, with a significant smile; for Aunt Sarah had never had a beau in her life, and was not supposed to know much about love affairs. But what lady will ever resign her privilege to judge upon such matters, albeit the tender passion has never moved her own bosom? `Now, brother, you are quizzing me; but seriously I do think Blanche is in love.' `Who can it be with. It is all nonsense.' `It is true, nevertheless. I see it in her cheek and in her eyes, and in every movement. She is in love you may rest assured,' repeated Mistress Sarah with emphasis, as she drew her needle to commence another row. `It must be with old Jack then, answered the captain, `for he is the only beau she has; and to tell you the truth I believe old Jack is dead in love with her.' `Why how can you speak so, brother,' exclaimed his sister, elevating her hands in amazement. `Well, it can't be anybody else. I believe next to you and I, she loves Jack and Nep. It must be one of us four, Sally.' `It can't be with any one in the village. There is not a young man that thinks of her, or visits here, she keeps herself so close at home.' `Then who can it be?' `So you are convinced, are you, that it is some one?' `Not hardly. I have noticed, not only the last week more particularly, but all along for a year or two, that she seemed to have a secret source of happiness within herself that she kept from us.' `Don't you think I have thought I saw the same thing!' cried aunt Sarah eagerly. `It is certain, then, if both of us noticed it; but I have remarked it, brother, more particularly in the last eight or ten days.' `So have I noticed it more.' `You have. Well, I am glad of it. Then it isn't my imagination, as you sometimes say things are?' `But, what have you seen in particular?' `Well, that would be hard to tell, brother. It is more by little things making up a whole, than any thing very apparent. But there is one. She seems to be expecting letters!' `Did she say so?' `No, but you see how anxious she has been about the mails, and running to the post-office, hardly before it was open.— To-night too.' `Perhaps it is only the papers?' `Then when she gets papers only, why does she come back with such a disappointed look?' `Does she?' `Why it is just as plain as can be in her face.' `Then if she is in love, as you say, it must be with somebody away. Somebody who is at a distance.' `That is clear!' responded aunt Sarah, as if she had received a new idea.— `Who can it be?' `That is more than I can tell. I will leave it for her to tell me, in good time, which she will be sure to do.' `I hope so; but if it was possible one might think it was one of the two young men.' `What! Worthington, and Nelson Orlorne?' `Yes.' `Why do you think so?' `Well, I do not think so positively.' `It can't be! They have not been heard of since they left! They have, therefore, neither of them distinguished themselves, or the papers would not have been silent, and it is now three years since she saw either of them.— She doesn't think of them, sister? They have passed out of her mind, and then she would not care a fig for them if they had not done something to win her, according to the terms that were arranged. No, not they? It is not either of them, if they are even living, which I question very much, or we should have had some accounts good or bad!' `If it were either of them that she could be thinking about, it would be Archibald Worthington; for before he and Nelson saved her life, so bravely as they did, they always as children, seemed to like each other. But who can it be?' `Perhaps it is not any body after all. It is as likely to be our unknown brave sailor as any one. We are, no doubt, only chasing a fog-bank. The best way will be to leave Blanche to show her own colours when she gets ready. Here comes somebody across the green from the direction of the Block-house. There are two of them. One has a bag on his back. The other I can't make out, but he looks like a soldier.' Auut Sarah jumped up to look out, and the same instant Blanche, who had overheard him as she passed near the door, came in with the quick, hurried step, and sparkling eye, of one who looks for a friend or an expected guest in every visitor. `Do you know either, Blanche?' asked her father. `No, sir,' she answered, eagerly watching them. `They seem to be quarrelling,' cried aunt Sarah. `The soldier tried to stop the other, but he has let him pass on,' said the captain. `He is a negro, brother,' exclaimed his sister. `See how his face glistens in the moonlight.' `And he is coming here?' said the captain. `I wonder what he can be.— Grace, be ready to go to the door.' CHAPTER IV. THE PRESENT. The beautiful daughter of the old sea-captain did not require to be told twice, to obey the promptings of her own wishes. He had kindly told her to go to the door, and see who it was that was coming with the sack, and to ascertain what he wanted, before he had disappeared from the room. `That girl expects something or somebody, you may be assured, sister!' said the Captain. `That eagerness is not for nothing. Did you see how she flew to obey me?' `Does any thing escape my observation, brother? I could not but help seeing it! I really hope that an end will soon be put to this suspense!' `I hope it won't effect your health, Sally,' said her brother, laughing. `It must be a terrible thing for a lady to have her curiosity thwarted.' `I will put the question direct to Blanche, if she doesn't soon tell me the whole.' `Perhaps the dear girl has nothing to tell after all, and we are both heaving the lead off soundings. But hark! that negro talks as loud as an old cook I once had.' `I wonder what he can want! I'll go and see, for it might not be safe for Blanche to be so near a black negro!' `I never yet saw a negro that was white, sister. But don't fear! Negroes are the most harmless people in the world! But you here in Kennebec don't see 'em very often, and so look upon them as some sort of a Johnny Scarcecrow.' `I'll see what he wants!' answered Aunt Sarah rising to go to the door. Blanche had gone into the entry to see who the person was approaching the door her heart bounding with, she knew not what hopes and fears. She opened the door at Cæsar's knock, and said on seeing the black, honest countenance of the black,— `Who do you wish to see?' `Am dis here Cap'n Talbo' house, missis?' asked Cæsar scraping his foot, and making his best bow as well as he could make it for the sack of oranges upon his back. `This is Captain Talbot's,' she answered with that courtesy which never deserted her, even when addressing the humblest individual. `Dis am de place den, Missis, and dis nigger hab no lost his reckonin'; but I might hab known it am de place soon as I see sich a handsum specimens ob beauty as yoursef, missis, coz it wouldn't be nobody else as live here but yourself, sure! You Cap'n Talbo's darter?' he added after this compliment, looking up at her in a very mysterious way, and rolling his eye in a fashion that almost made her laugh. `Yes.' `I know'd it! Den you am de very bressed one me wishes to see.' With these words he set down the bag of oranges upon the step, and taking from his cap a piece of old sail-cloth, he unrolled it very carefully, and exposed the unsullied outside of a note to the expecting, half-believing, half-doubting Blanche. `Dar, young missis,' said Cæsar, after looking all about him, and even over his head carefully, to see that he was not observed, `dar am a letter leetle bit for you from Massa Archy, and he —' `Hush! Don't speak!' she said putting up her finger before his eyes. `Don't say you brought one!' she added quickly as she hid it in her throbbing bosom, hearing her aunt's step. `No, missis, I keep dark! Massa Archy tell me gib you dat, and send de Cap'n dis bag of oranges, but not to tell him whar dey come from in tikkilar. I keep bery dark about de leety bit letter, missy.' `Are you Cæsar?' `Yis, missy, he, he, he! Whoy, how you know dat?' `Where is Archibald?' `Who, missis?' `Your young master, I mean?' `I guess he tell himself in de letter! He tell me say nottin' bout whar he be to nobody.' `Hist!' The door opened and Aunt Sarah made her appearance. Upon seeing the black face and broad shoulders of the negro, she started back a little, as if it was her duty to appear startled at the sight of a negro, even though her brother had assured her that they were very harmless, good natured beings. `Dear me! How black he is! Aint you afraid, Blanche? What does he want? I really begin to feel alarmed about you!' `He says he has brought a sack of oranges as a present to father.' `A sack of oranges! Oh, how delightful! Do you hear, brother?' she cried to the Captain, for she had left the parlor door open to secure her retreat from any perils. `Yes, tell him to come in! Bring aim in, Blanche! Whose man is he?' Blanche did not answer; but Cæsar as if called upon to be spokesman, lifted the sack and walked into the room with Blanche closing it, the outside door after him, and wondering what the present of oranges meant; and almost wild with joy and curiosity to read the letter: for she had recognized the well known hand of one with whom she had secretly corresponded for most of the time since the war had commenced. Restraining her impatience, and kissing the letter in the entry before following her aunt and the negro in, she proceeded to hear what he had to say. The Captain surveyed Cæsar from head to foot with a keen, inquiring look and then fixing his eyes full on his face, he seemed to observe his features as if he recognized familiar ones; but at last he shook his head and said, `No, it can't be! I must be mistaken. Who are you, my man?' Cæsar who had been all this while bowing and smiling with true African politeness, now drew himself up and answered, `Me Cæsar, massa Cap'n Talbo'!' `Captain Talbot, man!' `Cap'n Talbotty! Me no say him no better, massa.' `You are Cæsar, are you? Cæsar who?' `Cesar no more dan him!' `Then we'll have you Ceasar Africanus!' `Yis, massa.' `Well, what do you want with me? What have you got there, hey?' `Two hundred and fifty orange, massa.' `For me?' `Yis, massn.' `Who sent 'em?' `Well, massa, dem is too pertikkeler kestion,' answered Cesar, twirling his old tarpaulin about by a piece of spun-yarn which was tied about the crown in place of a ribbon. `You can't tell me?' `I'd rather not, massa. De orange speak for demsells. Dey sweat as sugarcane.' `Where did I ever see you before?' `Don't know, massa, where I hab dat honor.' `It is somewhere. Do you know me?' `Nebber hab de pleasure ob de recollection ob your features, massa,' answered Cesar, looking at him very attentively and with grave curiosity. `But I can't take these oranges, my man.' `Dey berry nice, ones, massa!' answered Cesar, untying the mouth of the bag, and displaying the golden tinted fruit, the fragrance of which had already filled the room. `Try him, massa; and you, old missis;' `Old? How very uncivil these negroes are,' thought Mistress Sarah; but she nevertheless accepted the orange which Cesar politely handed to her.— `And you, young Missis, please try him.' `No doubt they are good; but I don't like to accept of the fruit without knowing who they come from,' answered the captain. `They are not long from the West Indies, that is plain. Perhaps some sea-captain. What, my boy?' `Dey from a friend ob yours, massa, dat you may be sure.' `You black rascal,' said the captain, laughing, `tell me who sent them?' `The person say if you knew you might not like to take 'em, so he tell me not to tell.' `Then of course I shan't like to take 'em!' `Take them, brother. It is no doubt from one who is your warm friend,' said aunt Sarah, who was very fond of oranges, and did not wish by any means that these should be returned merely from the fact that the donor saw fit to withhold his name. `I'll see what Blanche says!' But Blanche had taken advantage of the controversy to glide from the room to the little porch at the back of the house, and there taking the letter from her bosom she broke it open and began to read it by moonlight; for she was too impatient to light a candle, and this might have betrayed her to the sharp eyes of her aunt. So she thought of the moon, how brightly it shone, and resolved it should lend her light, as it had, doubtless, lovers before her day. The letter began as follows: `Dearest Blanche, —' But we have no right to peep over the blushing, happy girl's shoulder and read the letter she so carefully concealed even the existence of from her father. We will wait until she sees fit to unfold the whole mystery to her father and aunt, and read to them without fear the letter she now read with such a bright eye and happy heart. When she had ended its perusal, she kissed the name which was signed to it, and murmuring more than once `Dear, noble Archy!' she thrust it back into the secret covert of her bosom, and hastened to re-enter the parlor. `Ho, Blanche! Where have you been?' asked the captain. `I have got news.' `Yes, that will surprise you!' exclaimed her aunt. `You have no idea who sent this present.' `May I guess?' she asked smilingly, as if she did not know. `Yes; but you need not try,' said her aunt, eager to tell her. `The black man has confessed. It is from Archibald worthington!' `From him?' `Yes, girl. Isn't it odd enough!' said her father. `I made the darky who stands grinning there as if he was a laughing ivory-mill, I made him tell me. For I got him by the ear and held him till he out with it.' `Dat he did sure enuff, Missis,' answered Cesar, rubbing his left ear. `But you see massa tell me not to tell 'xcept I hab to, and den tell 'em it was Archibal' Word'nt'n!' `That's his pronunciation, Blanche. Archibald is alive and will be here, he says, in a day or two. Isn't this news? Why you don't seem to be at all surprised!' `I never was so much so in my life,' answered Miss Sarah; `I had given him up for dead at least. Now you will soon see, at least, one of your lovers!' `I shouldn't be surprised after this if both of 'em turned up,' answered the Captain. `But I can't get any thing out of this Afracanus Cesar, Blanche, except that Worthington is not many miles off, and will be here soon to answer all questions. Why what has he been doing in all the war, man? We haven't heard truck nor kelson of him before; and here the first thing he sends me this negro sailor, or landsman, or whatever he is, for he wears the colours of both crafts, with a bag of oranges!' `Coz, Massa Cap'n he just come from de West Indies, and he knows you like oranges bery much.' `Well, go and tell him I am glad to receive 'em, and shall be happy to see him whenever he choose to heave in sight. Did you sail in the same ship with him? Is he a common sailor yet?' `He tell you all dat, massa cap'n, when he sees you.' `How provoking to be kept in such mystery,' said aunt Sarah. `But look at Blanche! She doesn't seem to be so much surprised as she ought to be under the circumstances!' `I shouldn't wonder, after all, if she knew who the oranges camefrom before we did!' said the captain, looking curiously at Blanche, who looked as if she was quite well pleased with herself and every body. She seemed as if she was ready to laugh every minute. She busied herself very industriously in looking over the oranges. `I declare! I shouldn't either, brother! But if Archibald Worthington is only a common sailor, she couldn't think of him. Should you, Blanche?' `What say, aunt?' `The child don't seem to be listening at any thing. I do believe she has all along known about him, and has had letters from him!' `She never could have corresponded with him, sister, unless he had got higher than before the mast, love him as much as she might. She knows that now, Archibald has no hopes, unless he has done something to win her. A bag of oranges isn't enough to buy you with, Blanche, if this is all the boy has got in his three year's absence.' `That it is not. Perhaps after all Nelson Osborn may yet come back with something more than a bag of oranges.' `Did you not say, man, that Archibald was a sailor?' `Yes, massa, Cap'n, be sailor ebbery inch on him.' `And, I dare say, you are the cook of the vessel he come home in?' `Me come in de same ship sure enuff; but me no cook, massa. But he tell you to-morrow.' `Well, I can wait to hear what he has to say for himself,' answered the captain; `so sister, restrain your curiosity till then. What shall be done with these oranges, Blanche?' `I'll take charge of them, brother,' said his sister, rising. `And the man: where can he sleep?' `Me go back to-night, massa cap'n.' `No, you do no such thing. I dont turn even a negro out in the night. We will find a birth for you in the old barrack somewhere.' `No, tankee, mass. Jis gib Cesar de sack, and let him go.' `Very well. Tell master Worthington he will be welcome whenever he comes.' `Yes, massa, me sure to tell him.' `And would you say the same to Nelson Osborne, brother?' asked Sarah. `To be sure. I am bound to receive both, and to make them equally welcome, till they prove their claims to Blanche's hand. But Osborn, I think, will hardly turn up.' `I hope not,' said Aunt Sarah, `I know Blanche hopes not, too.' `What if I should say, I wish neither would have turned up,' answered Blanche, laughing. `But I suppose I will have to obey my father, and marry the one who proves himself to have distinguished himself most. But to tell you the truth, dear father—' `Well, now for it, Sally. Here it comes.' `Oh, do tell the truth, Blanche. It is somebody else. I knew it was all the time. Who is it?' `I will wait till another time,' she answered, looking at Cesar significantly. `Yes, yes,' said the captain, `you are right. Well, my man, so you will go?' `Yes, massa.' `There is a dollar for you.' `Tankee, massa, but I nebber take bribes,' ansered Cesar, with dignity. `Who the devil is bribing you?' said the captain laughing. `You are au honest fellow.' `He knows how to keep a secret,' said Aunt Sarah, a little severely. There must be something wrong, or Archibald Worthington would not act so mysteriously about himself.' `Perhaps he wanted to send this light craft ahead to sound the channel and see how the land lay after his long absence,' said the captain. `Dat jiss it, massa. He know how he be received, by knowing how de oranges is; and den he want to see how all is afore he comes.' `That is all right. He understands navigating his craft, I see. Tell him to come alongside as soon as he chooses. To-morrow, we are going down the river a mile or two to fish; and if he choses to cross our track, he's welcome to come aboard.' `I tell him, massa.' `Will it be prudent, brother, to invite him. One doesn't know what he is now. The present of a bag of oranges doesn't show that he should be received so freely. `I'll run the risk. Besides, till we hear evil of these two young men, we must believe good. Not having heard from either of these for three years doesn't prove they have been pirates or bandits.' `It shows they have'nt done anything worthy of praise at least,' answered aunt Sarah, with some emphasis. Cesar now threw his bag across his shoulder, made a scrape and low obeisance to the captain, and backed towards the door. `Good night, massa Cap'n.' `Good night, Cesar Africanus. Tell master Archibald Worthington all I have said.' `Yes, massa,' answered Cesar, as he opened the door, and disappeared in the entry, Blanche after him. CHAPTER V. THE CONFESSION. `Tell him, Cesar,' said Blanche, in a hurried under tone, to the negro, as she was opening the outer door for him, `tell him to come without any more delay than he can help. Tell him we are going on the river to-morrow early, and that if he is near the half-way rock about noon, he will be sure to see our boat.' `Me sure to tell him, Misses. Bless me how glad I be to see you and find out you be sich a beautiful lady, misses. I berry grad for massa Archy.' `Don't linger? There, good night. But I had forgotten! Take this!' and with her scizzors as she stood in the moonlit door, she clipped a tress from her glorious auburn hair, and handed it to him. `Give this to him, Cesar?' `Lor a massy. How nigger car dis! I guess I put him in de same ting I put de letter in for bring you.' With this he took from his pocket the piece of canvass cloth to wrap up the shining tress in. But she at once recovered the ringlet with a laugh at her careless way of sending the token her lover had asked for, and folding it in her snowy white handkerchief, she placed both in his hand. `There, give it to him as it is.' `Yis, missis,' but I'll jist, to make all safe wrap em up again in dis ere rag.' And Blanche beheld her cambric handkerchief disappear within the folds of the old canvass cloth, and then stowed away in the top of Cesar's old tarpaulin. The African then bade the fair girl good night, and hurried away from the door. She followed him with her eyes across the green, and saw him pass the old block-house, and disappear down the bank, followed rapidly by a person whom she saw come out from the shadow of the dark wall of the block-house, after Cesar had got by. She was about to remark upon this, and wonder who it could be, if not her lover `Archy,' himself, when Aunt Sarah came out, saying— `You will certainly get your death of cold, child. `How can you be so imprudent!' `I am coming right in, Aunt. I only came out to see the negro-man nut.' `He could open the door himself, I dare say. I am beginning to mistrust something. Indeed I am quite sure something is going on that ought not to be the case!' Brother thinks so too. `No, Sally, no,' called out the captain, in his bluff hearty tone; `I don't think anything wrong is going on. It is true, Blanche and the negro Africanus seemed to hold a little confab at the door, as he went out. But it was not half so long, nor quarter, as you are in the habit of holding in the entry with every lady that calls, just as she is going away. Indeed Indeed I sometimes think your tongue is never fairly loosened for talking till your lady visitors get up to go.' `But I don't talk with negro people, brother.' `Well, well; let Blance defend herself if she thinks she has need to. Perhaps she wanted to send some word to Archibald.' `It would have been decidedly improper for her to have done so, under the circumstances,' exclaimed Aunt Sarah, with some dignity. `She ought not to show any favor to any of the young men till you have decided for her and them, brother!' `Dear Aunt don't get displeased with me,' said Blanche, who looked a little perplexed, as if undecided how to act; but feeling that she owed it to the two best friends she had in the world, to clear up what so much troubled her Aunt, she resolved that she would at once unfold some of the secrets of the past; but not all of them as yet, for the time for the full development was not yet arrived; and another, not herself, then, was to be the speaker. `I am not displeased, dear. I only am interested for your happiness.' `I know it, Aunt. Therefore, I will at once explain to you all that I have done. If I have been guilty of wrong, I hope you and my dear father will forgive me.' `I forgive you beforehand, child,' said the captain, kindly, and decidedly, `for I know you have done nothing I should disapprove.' `I will then tell you what I have done, my dear father,' she said, seating herself by his side, and taking his hand, while her Aunt closing the entry door, took her chair a little nigher than usual to her brother, as if she expected to hear some great secret unfolded. `Now, my dear aunt, and my dear father, that I have resolved to tell you what you do not know, I hardly know how to begin,' she said, her cheeks blushing with confusion. `Begin where you please, dear,' said the captain. `Begin at the beginning, Blanche.' `Well, then, at the beginning. You know, my dear father, that when Archibald Worthington and Nelson Osborne were so fortunate as to rescue me from the top of the carriage, and saved my life just as I was about to be carried down the rapid, you promised them—that—' `That if they did anything in the war then commencing, to render them worthy of you, I would give you to him, who most distinguished himself.' `Yes, sir,' answeaed Blanche, with an embarraed air. `But brother, interposed Aunt Sarah, `but you did not give them this promise till they asked for Blanche. You did not wish to force your daughter upon them.' `No, not a bit. They both seemed to think, that as they had happened to save the sweet child's life, (and they saved her with gallant risks, too,) they ought to have her to wife. So, when they both came afterwards to see her, and like to have quarreled with each other for her smiles, I had to take the matter up to prevent blood-shed, or they would have been pistolling each other, no doubt; and I said to them, `Now my brave young men, your country is just entering upon a just war with one of the most powerful nations on the earth. England has been insulting us for years, impressing our seamen as if she could do it with impunity, and otherwise invading our rights. `Now,' said I to them, `you are both young men; and of equal age and prospects. One of you has been some little time at sea, and the other has not done much of anything, but amuse himself with his gun and boat. Now hark ye, my lads! If you love my daughter, you can wait for her and serve your country for her. If she is worth the having she is worth the winning. Now you have certainly done her a great service in rescuing her from death. But you can't regard this as a sufficient reason why a young lady ought to marry either of you, though it may lead you to feel kindly towards her. Besides you can't both have her. Now go to the wars. Enlist either in the army or navy, and distinguish yourselves. Keep Blanche in your eye, if you love her, and for her sake and your own, let me hear good news of you. At the end of the war return, and he who has shown himself most worthy of her, shall have her in marriage with her father's blessing.' `I remember it perfectly, brother,' said Aunt Sarah. `And so does Blanche, though she wasn't in the room; and I remember that Nelson Osborne said that the war might last like the old one, seven years and this would be a long while to wait.' `And I said to him that Jacob had served seven years for Rebecca. And Archibald said he would be willing to serve twice as long for Blanche, so that he would win her at last. But I told them I would give them three years. So they accepted my terms and started for the wars. Worthington went to Boston and joined some frigate there, and Osborne enlisted and marched for Plattsburgh, I believe. But nothing certain has been known of either of them since. And it is full three years since they went.' `Three years, to-morrow, father answered Blanche. `So you have kept the reckoning, have you, girl. I thought you was so engaged in looking out of the window at the moolight, you didn't hear a word I was saying. But where is your secret you was to tell.' `Yes, instead of Blanche's talking, brother, you have been talking. `Well, I was only refreshing your memories. Go on, Blanche; don't let your Aunt's curiosity be kept long to leeward of your secret.' `Well, as I was saying, dear father, when you promised me to one of these young men, after they had saved my life, if they would earn for themselves a name in the war, of course, I had nothing to do but to acquiesce. I was grate ful to both of them when I recollected how courageously they had ventured out in the frail skiff, when no man dared launch a boat, and at the imminent hazard of being carried over the falls with me, rescued me from the floating carriage.' `I shall never forget my sensations as I found myself approaching the roaring rapids, nor the joyful hope of yet being saved, as the voices of the young men reached my ears, encouraging me, and I beheld their approach! Archibald was the first to extend his hand, and when I grasped it I felt that life was yet to be mine again! Aided by Nelson, he lifted me from the top of the carriage into the skiff, and I still hear the shouts of the people on the shore! And when Archibald placed me in your arms, my dear father, I felt that I could willingly have given him myself if he had asked me of you at that moment of happiness!' `I shall never forget that moment, child. But certainly Nelson did as much as Worthington. Alone Archy could have done nothing.' `True, sir; but Archibald seemed so superior to him throughout all. I hardly thought of any one but him.' `You should have been equally grateful, child, to both!' `I was so, sir, but—' `But Nelson wasn't Archibald. I see how it was. Go on, dear.' `Well, sir,' answered Blanche, smiling through the mantling roses upon her cheeks, `I could not gainsay your words when you told them that they must win me. I consented; though, I confess, I felt that I could never be the wife of Nelson Osborne, though he came back the greatest hero of the war. Still I consented, because I well knew he would, all he might do, still be inferior in honor and name to Archibald! I felt no fears that he would elipse Archibald, or ever demand my hand!' `By my faith! You had great confidence both ways, Blanche! But what do you say now? Neither of them have distinguished themselves! So far as I see, all Archibald has done is to come back a sailor and bring a bag of oranges with him. If Nelson returns, he will hardly bring less. The way, therefore, to settle it will be to give you to neither.' `To neither, sir?' repeated Blanche quickly. `Yes; they don't either seem to have done any thing to merit your hand!' `Perhaps you may not think so always, sir,' answered Blanche, smiling. `But I promised to tell you all I know, at least all that Archibald will not tell you. I will now frankly say, therefore, that from the first I liked Archibald best!' `That was clearly seen!' `And I still like him the best, and am willing to have him as my—as my husband, father, if I must have a husband!' `We will see, first, what account he gives of himself,' answered the captain. `I am willing to abide by this, sir.— But it is my duty to tell you that the evening before Archibald left I had a few minutes conversation with him, just round there by the side of the old Block-house!' `You did, hey?' exclaimed the captain dryly. `How imprudent,' ejaculated Aunt Sarah. `That was hardly fair in Archy. It was stealing a march on his rival,' added the captain. `Well, sir, I had one with Nelson, too!' `Oh, you did! That alters the case.' `Did you ever! Who would have thought it!' exclaimed Aunt Sarah, amazed. `Yes, with both of them. Nelson came first and sent his little brother, saying he wished to speak with me only for a moment before he went away. So I went to hear what he wanted to say.— And he begged me to let him write to me!' `And what answer did you make him?' asked the captain gravely. `That when he distinguished himself in any honorable manner he should have the liberty of writing to me in an envelope to you.' `Well and discreetly answered, girl,' said her father. `And what said Archibald to you?' `Nelson had hardly left me ten minutes, and while I was still standing on the bank looking at some fishermen spearing salmon by torch-light, I heard a step near me. I turned and saw Archibald. He said he could not leave without seeing me, and was just going to the house to ask your permission, father, to say a few words to me in private.' `That speaks better for him than for Nelson, who went clandestinely about it.' `It shows, sir, the difference between the two young men in every thing,' answered Blanche with animation. `He seemed very much pleased to find me there alone, and said he had come to take leave of me, and to ask me if I would permit him to write me occasionolly under cover to my aunt!' `How very proper that was, brother!' remarked Aunt Sarah, well gratified; `I see he is a young man who knows propriety. And what did you say to him, Blanche? How odd both should ask you the same thing!' `I told him that when he had in any honorable way distinguished himself he might write to me; but not till then.' `Very good, Blanche. I see you are a sensible nice girl,' answered the cap tain. `And did you ever get any letters?' eemanded Aunt Sarah looking at her very closely. `Not less than a dozen, aunt,' answered Blanche, laughing. `Mercy on me! Not less than a dozen!' repeated her aunt, dropping her knitting upon her lap and holding up both hand in amazement and horror. `A dozen letters! How the deuce did you get them?' exclaimed the captain, looking surprised. `Not under cover to me, I am certain,' added Aunt Sarah. `Yes, aunt, under cover to you! But as I knew the hand-writing, I always took them out and paid for them myself, to save you the expense; and, as only the outsides were to you, I opened them without showing them to you. If any one is to blame, it is I.' `You are very much to blame!' answered Aunt Sarah; and she was the more angry, because she saw a smile on the captain's face. It, however, soon passed off into a grave expression. `How could you keep this secret from me, Blanche, for so long a time?' he asked. `Because, father, I wished to surprise you.' `To surprise me! Well you have succeeded! I was never more surprised in my life.' `Nor I either!' `Then I am to suppose he has distinguished himself, as he has written to you, Blanche!' said the captain. `Yes, sir. He has indeed done so.' `And nothing in the papers!' `How has he done so, Blanche?' `You shall learn from his own lips to-morrow, father.' `Well, I will wait till to-morrow, if you wish it; but it seems all very odd to me!' `Very odd, and very remarkable. I don't like so much mystery!' ejaculated Aunt Sarab. `I wish I could have got hold of one of the letters. I can under stand now why you would never let any body go to the post-office but yourself. Oh, Blanche, how very sly and naughty you have been! I dare say he understood you only were to take them out, and wrote only for your eye to read!' `Yes, aunt. After his first letter I wrote to him that I would always take them out, especially as he had a secret he wished no body to know but myself.' `A secret between you. How improper all this has been. Who would have thought it of you. Really I don't know what to think of you after this, Blanche.' `Just as you have before, dear aunt. When you see Archibald he will clear all up to you, be assured.' `I trust so, child, I trust so,' answered the captain, `for I confess I don't like the way you have been sailing under false colours.' `True colours they'll turn out to be, dear father, when you see Arcnibald!' she answered, warmly. `Well, I hope so. When did you get his first letter?' `Eighteen months ago.' `I'll never say again, Sarah, that a woman can't keep a secret.' `I am glad you are convinced for once, brother.' `Where was it written from?' `Rio Janeiro, sir. It was written in good faith, after he had distinguished himself, and was enclosed to aunt, but sealed, and with the request that I should keep from her and you a certain secret in it, letting you read all but the postscript.' `And you did'nt even let us know of it at all, Blanche.' `No, aunt. I thought I would not, but wait till the next. And so I waited after each letter till the next come, and so it has been until to-night. But I will let you see the one I have received tonight and the one I got last week.' `You received one to-night!' exclaimed both her father and aunt Sarah. `Yes,' she answered,' taking the letter Cæsar had given her from her bosom. `The negro gave me this in the entry; and I now have no objections to your sceing and reading it.' `I thought something was going on in the entry,' said aunt Sarah, as if gratified at her own sagacity. `So he gave you a letter.' `And the bag of oranges was only the letter bag after all,' said the captain, laughing. `Well, let us have it. I believe all will yet clear up bright, Sarah, though it has looked a little squally.' CHAPTER VI. THE RENCONTRE. The two letters to which Blanche alluded she now exhibited. One of them was worn and crumpled, but the other fresh and fair. The letter she abstracted from her bosom; but the former came from the depths of her pocket. Aunt Sarah's eyes were set wide open at the sight of the letters, and she reached forth her hand to take one of them; but Blanche held them firmly, saying, as she displayed the addresses, `No, no. I will read them, aunt. But you see they are directed to you.' `That they are. Well, now read them honestly, every word, Blanche' `I'll trust her for that, Sarah,' said her father. `This first one I got from Boston, a week ago. It is dated at Boston, and begins thus, `Dear Blanche—' `Why, how familliar and improper.' `Hist, Sally. Let Blanche go on,' said the captain. `I expected neither more nor less than the `dear.” `I have at last returned to my native shores, and my first duty, as it is my greatest happiness, is first to write you' assuring you of my continued devotion to you. Absence, instead of diminishing, has increased my attachment to you, (here was a `dearest Blanche' which the maiden skipped over!) and although I have seen fair and charming women in the various climes I have visited, not one of them has for a moment made me forget one fairer than all!' `Dear me. What an open flatterer. I really—' `Hist, Sally. Let Blanche finish the letter.' `I am now preparing to leave for the Kennebec. I shall probably take passage in the schooner `Augusta,' that sails the day after to-morrow. I hope to be at my mother's, in Hallowell, by the last of the week; and I shall then write to you. You may expect to see me, or hear from me, by Thursday, which, you will recollect, at least I do, is just the expiration of the three years' probation given us by your father.' `That is to-morrow,' said the captain. `How well the young fellow writes.' `He may have done nothing but write,' remarked aunt Sarah. He seems to have practised pretty well in flattery. I wonder Blanche is n't spoiled. And such kind of letters coming every month to her. Dear me, when I was a young girl if—' `Is the letter ended, Blanche?' asked her father, kindly. `No, sir.' `Then go on.' `I shall not venture,' he says, sir, `to go direct to your house without first sounding my way; for I fear your father, not having heard any good of me, may not be willing to receive me as I could wish. So I will send you word when I get to my mother's. The bearer will be the faithful Cæsar, whom you have so often heard me speak, or rather make mention in my letters. By him send me word how things are at home. I trust your respected aunt still enjoys her health, and that the hand of time has dealt lightly with your father's locks. If you think best, you can let him know that Archibald Worthington is returned; but perhaps you had best keep the secret a little while longer till you hear that I am at home. I have much to say to you when we meet, and particularly about one in whom we have both had some interest. Believe me, dearest Blanche, ever faithfully, your friend and—and—' `And what? Don't skip, Blanche,' said aunt Sarah, eagerly. `Out with it, girl. I see he is a noble fellow if he hasn't done any thing. Don't fear to read out.' `Your friend and love, Archibald Worthington.' `Was ever! Well, I declare I am astounded! So this is it! She has been all the while having him for a lover when she knew that it depended on his conduct, whether he was ever to be any thing to her or not. How do you know Blanche, but you may be Nelson Osborne's wife, after all.' `Never, aunt,' responded the maiden, firmly. `Then you have made up your mind to have Archibald Worthington, whether brother says so or not!' `No, aunt. I know father will give his consent.' `I don't know, Blanche. He must fulfil the bond. He must show that he is worthy of the hand he seeks.' `Perhaps he can do so, sir.' `I hope he can. We will see what he has to say for himself. I don't want to be hard with either of the young men. One is as much entitled to a hearing as another. Still, I must confess I would rather this Worthington should be the successful man.' `Why, haven't the papers said something about him, Blanche, if he has done any thing. They don't omit any thing worth mentioning; though the person may be only a sailor. There is that brave youth, William Archer, who was only a seaman on board a frigate, and see what he did, and what the papers said about him. And here, to-night, we find he is made a lieutenant. No, no.— If your `lover' as he presumes to sign himself, had done anything worthy of notice, or worth meriting your hand, the papers would have had it. For my part I would give my consent for the brave William Archer to marry you, though I never laid eyes on him, than before this Archibald Worthington; who, after all, is returned, so far as I see, only a common sailor, with only a bag of oranges to show for his three years absence.' The captain laughed at this, for he saw that aunt Sarah was a little on the indignant, good-tempered as she usually was. Blanche sat silent, looking by no means alarmed, but rather seemed to be gratified at her aunt's excitement of manner, as if she felt that the result that would by and by appear, would suddenly dissipate all this cloud upon her brow. `Well, Blance, the other letter brought by Cesar Africanus, the sly dog! You forget there is another letter, Sally.' `I don't know whether I ought to listen to any more such letters.' `Very well, aunt, I will then—' `No, read it, read it. We had best know the worst. The idea that you have been corresponding so long—eighteen months—dear me, I wonder, brother, you don't show more anger.' `I have such faith in Blanche's good conduct, that I know it must be all right at bottom, though it looks rather odd. Read, Blanche.' `My dear Blanche—' `Keep silent, sister,' cried the Captain, holding up his finger. No exclamations. One would think you had never heard or seen a love-letter.' `I! If you think so, brother, you are very much mistaken. In my younger days— `Go on, Blanche.' `My dear Blanche, `I know not how to express to you my joy, at being once more so near you.— How have I wished and longed to be where I could once more behold, even only from a distance, the spot where you dwell. I can hardly realize that I am within two miles of you while I write, and that as I look from the window of the room, I can see the oak-crowned hill that towers above the old Block-house and barracks. I am impatient to see you and learn from your father's lips my fate. I shall come up to-morrow without fail. I have only been half an hour arrived home. I find my mother well and overjoyed to embrace me again.— Her humble abode seems to me a dear and blessed shelter, after all the stormy scenes of the last three years. She little suspects my love for you, or the career I have paused through. Occasionally I wrote her home, but told her nothing save of my welfare. A glad surprise awaits her; for I see she looks sorrowful, that I have not brought home a distinguished name; for she loves you, and has set her heart upon your being my wife. Happy word. Happy thought. `I send this by my faithful Cesar. I also send a sack of oranges as a present to your father and aunt. You may tell them, if you choose, that they came from Archibald Worthington, who has returned home from sea. I have ordered Cesar to keep his tongue close, for naturally he is a great gossip; and if he should begin, he would tell all: and what is to be told, I prefer being the narrator of myself. I shall bring with me papers to prove what will be necessary. To-morrow, I shall certainly be with you. Till then, Heaven bless you. Your attached and true, A. W.' `He doesn't say lover this time, Sally,' said the captain, mischievously glancing at his sister. `He might as well. But there is a postscript, Blanche.' `I would rather not read it, aunt.' `You must dear. No secrets now.' `After to-morrow there shall be none. I can't read the postscript, dear aunt.— You shall have this and all the other letters to read after to-morrow.' `That is enough, Sarah. Don't urge her,' said the captain. She has told quite enough for one evening. I only hope that this young man, Blanche, is going to prove himself worthy of you.' `He will, dear father,' she answered earnestly. The postscript which she carefully withheld ran as follows, for we will take the liberty to peep into the letter. `P.S.—Send by bearer a lock of your hair, dearest Blanche, as a token that I am still loved, and that my presence will be welcome on the morrow. Whereever your name is written on this note, I have imprinted upon it a thousand kisses, all of which I send to you.' What would not aunt Sarah have given, dear reader, to have had a peep with you, at this delicious postscript. As it was she did not seem very well pleased, but made some remark touching the impropriety of which she had been guilty in receiving any letters at all, when a knock was heard at the door. It was a sharp, abrupt knock, that made them start, and the captain to exclaim— `Who can that be? Go to the door, Sarah.' `Yes, I think it is best I should go.— No more secret messages.' As she spoke she laid aside her knitting, and, taking up the candle, went out into the entry to see who called. `Father,' said Blanche, taking his hand and kissing it, `do not judge Archibald Worthington till you have seen him and hear what he has to say. Treat him to-morrow kindly, for he is worthy of your confidence.' `I will, Blanche; but it is all mysterous to me. But I know you would never do wrong.' `Thanks, dear father. Perhaps I ought to have told you the whole loug ago; but I could not do so well, and there was, as you will see, a sort of necessity that I should keep the secret.' `I dare say, I dare say. But who can that be talking to your aunt Sally? He asked for me. Why, girl, what is the matter? You have turned deadly pale.' `Nothing, sir—nothing. Excuse me a moment. I will return soon, perhaps.' And, thus speaking, she kissed his cheek and hastened from the room just as Aunt Sarah re-entered, ushering in the young man in the infantry uniform, who had encountered Cæsar at the block-house, where we left him watching for his return, and from whence Blanch had seen him dart out to follow the negro down the bank. We also will follow him and see the result of his pursuit. Cæsar, after having begun the descent of the bank to reach his skiff, in which he had come up from Hallowell, heard a footstep above him, and looking up, beheld the youthful soldier. He did not like his company, for he immediately bounded down the bank and ran swiftly to his boat. But the stranger was fleeter of foot and came up with him ere he could gain his skiff.— Finding he could not escape, Cæsar turned short upon him and brandished a glittering knife before his eyes. `What for you come for chase me, heh? You keep away, massa, or I make de moonlight shine right froo you' body.' `Cæsar,' said the man coarsely, `where is your master or your friend, or whatever he is?' `You shan't hab no answer from me, for I nebber tells what I don't choose.— 'Sides I knows you axes for no good. I don't know zactly who you is, thof I knows I seen you afore and nebber like you.' `Will you answer my question?' asked the man, brandishing his sword above his head. But Cæsar stood immovable and fearless, holding in his grasp the gleaming knife. `I shan't answer; and if you doesn't let dis child 'lone, you be sure get de worst ob de fuss.' `How came you and your master to escape? I thought he was dead, and you too, till to-night. `You did, heh! Who you be, den? What you know about bein' dead or scaping? 3 Who is you?' demanded Cæsar, his curiosity now evidently alive. `No matter. You have been in the house on the green there. Who did you see there?' `Massa, I am in too much ob hurry to stand here. If you follows me I'll kil, you sure. I ant afraid ob you sword while I hold dis knife in my hand dis-a-way. So keeps you' distance.' `You infernal scoundrel, if I had a pistol I would shoot you.' `I berry glad you hant. But 'scuse mel massa, but dere someting in you voice den make me want to see you face better.' And with these words, without further intimation, Cæsar, who seemed to be as brave as he was black, knocked up his hat from his forehead, and rolled it on the ground, at the same time with his other hand he caught the sword with a firm grasp. The moonlight fell full and brightly upon the features, hitherto so carefully shaded, and the negro uttered an exclamation of recognition and sur prise, while his eyes flashed fire. `Ah, ha! me know you now, you debble white man. You die now sure,' he cried fiercely. But the young man, with a cry of alarm at his danger, sprung backwards, leaving his sword in the African's hand, and took to his heels. He fled up the bank like a deer, pursued for a few yards by Cæsar, who then gave up the chase, muttering with fierce exultation, `You better run, soon as he see you cognised. Me kill you dead. If Master Arch know'd you was here he'd run you through de heart. I thought I know'd de voice,' added Cæsar as the fugitive disappeared over the verge of the bluff. `But who spec ebber see him agen? I know why he call me Cæsar so familiar, keepin' his own face hid; and I know what him ax after massa Archy for. He want to kill him agen. Guess massa Archy hab him hanged if he cotch him. Oh, de willain! No wonder be ax if massa Archy no dead and me too. If Cæsar ebber cotch him agen, he make dead man ob him sure.' With these words the African, after looking in the direction of the fugitive's flight, to see if he he could see anything more of him, turned back, and was going to get into his skiff, which he had left just above the short pier, where the `Wind-Eater' lay, when he found himself suddenly seized by the breast by Neptune, who, having seen the two persons near the shallop, and suspecting their good intentions, had left the deck and walked up the beach to inspect them. Cæsar was passing along in the shade of an oak, when the dog, who crouched in covert for him, suddenly darted out and grappled with him with that unhesitancy with which such animals usually light upon a negro. `What de debble dis? Oh, bress my soul! Cæsar no steal noting, massa dog!' cried Cæsar with terror, as he felt the fierce hot breathing of the dog upon his face. Juss leff a me go, good big dog. I don't want kill you, but sure I put dis knife in you if you do no leff go.' `Come off, Nep. Off, sir,' cried Jack, who had been roused from a nap on the deck at the cries of Cæsar, and fearing for the life of the dog; for he could see the negro's weapon glitter in the moon-beams above Neptune's head. `Come down, I say.' The dog released his strong grasp, and at the same moment Jack reached the spot. Upon seeing that it was a negro, (for the sons of Africa were rare in those days in the valley of the Kennebec), he started with surprise. `What are you doing here? Hush your growling, Nep. What are you cruising about here for, darkey? Show your colors. Look you, what are you doing with knives and swords?' `Bress me! don't ax too many kestions at onct. I honest.' `If you are honest, give me your weapons,' said Jack resolutely. `Will massa keep dog off?' `Yes—he shan't touch you. Now come on board the barky and give an account of yourself. CHAPTER VII. THE YOUNG SAILOR. Cæsar having delivered up his weapons, for he found that with the sailor and dog against him he was a prisoner, quietly followed Jack to the shallop a few yards distant, Neptune walked close at his side with a low growl, as if ready, at the least intimation of a desire to escape, to fly at his throat; and to a negro a dog is at all times a more terrible enemy than a man. `You see, massa,' said Cæsar, begining his defence as he followed Jack on board the little craft, `you see I was sent up here by my young master on a yerrand.' `Who is your master?' asked Jack gruffly, as he stepped to the gang-way plank upon the deck and laid the sword and knife on the companion-way; `these here pen-knives look like something going on as orten to, and I'm watch about here, and must see as how no strange sail cruises about under false colors.— Now let's hear you give a reason why I shan't hand you over to the old Captain for punishment.' `Bress your soul, is it Captin Talbo' you speaks ob?' exclaimed Cæsar with hope. `Talbot, man! What do you know of him?' asked Jack, eyeing him closely. `Why, bress you, massa mate, I jiss come from dere. It was to him I comed on de yerrand.' `That true!' `Sure as can be, massa mate. You jiss go ax him.' `Yess, and let you escape. No, no. I ant an old bird to be caught with chaff, and by a nigger, too.' `I no want catchee, massa. I bring oranges present to massa Cap'n Talbo'. I juss leave 'em dere. Dis here de berry bag I cares 'em in.' `It doos smell orangey,' said Jack, snuffing at it, while Neptune snuffed at Cæsar's shins, as if he was very desirous of taking a mouthful out. `Sure it doo, massa. Jiss please keep you dog away, please, massa.' `Go walk the deck, Nep.' The dog obeyed, and Cæsar started with amazement to see him pace the quarter-deck. `Dat be de last ting dis child ebber see. He second mate, massa.' `No, he's first luff, darkey. So you've been up to the Captain's. Who did you see in the parlor cabin?' `Wall, thar was the Cap'n and a nodder oldish kind ob missus, and a berry handsome young missus.' `That's all accordin to log. Now who's your master?' `He down to Hallowell. He massa Arch, and juss come from Bosson; and bein massa Cap'n Talbo' was a old friend, he sends me up to-night wid dis bag full ob orange as a present.' `That is a straight yarn. If your master is the Captain's friend I'll be your's. There's my hand. What is your name?' `Caesar.' `I could ha' guessed it without axin', for I never knowed a nigger that hadn't Caesar spliced on to his figure-head. What are you doing with that soger's sword and this here Spanish knife toot?' ` Well, massa mate, I hab to tell you de whole story if I begin, and I hab to be back to massa Archy soon as I can, coz he'll be lookin' for me.' `I'll let you go when I hear about the knives here, darkee. A man, specially a blackee, who is cocht skulkin 'bout the barky with two such boarding weapons, must be overhauled to know where he's bound, what his cargo is, and what his colors is. So uncoil here ; but first here's a glass of grog for you,' added Jack, taking from a shelf under the cover of the companion-way a bottle and tin-cup, placed there for his own convenience when on deck at night; for Jack insisted upon standing watch in the shallop every four hours, Ned keeping the deck the other four. This was his habit at sea, which he could never rid himself of on land. The grog was therefore placed conveniently for him to take a pull now and then during his watch. `Tankee, massa, I b'leives I will take a bit, jist for please you,' answered Caesar complacently. ` Your ver' good helf, massa.' `Here's to you, darkee. May you live a thousand years, as the Dons say!' responded Jack, taking a nipper. ` `Now for the yarn about the weapons.' `Well, you see, as I is comfortable, and 'tant late yet, I'll jist tell you, specially as I wants you to be on your guard agen de willain as I tuk de sword from ; so I jiss tell you what he is, coz de community ort to know.' ' Well, in course it ort, if he is a villia', answered Jack very positively as he took his seat on the companion-way, while Caesar sat upon a cask placed against the quarter-railing. ` Now heave a-head.' 'Well, you see, in de fust place, I is a West Indgy nigger.' `I guessed that afore, darkee. I've been in the Havanna, and seed jist sich craft as you, shaped jist like you fore aed aft, top-knot and all. Now a Orleans or a 'Merikan nigger looks different. Yes, I'd swore you was a West Indgy,' and Jack twisted off a finger's length of pigtail and thrust it into his cheek, offering at the same time the roll of tobacco to Caesar, with `Do you chaw, darkee ?' politely. `I does n't, massa, answered Caesar `Then forge a head. You ses as how you are a West Indgy,' `Yiss, massa mate, and-' `Avast there, shipmate. Who told you I was mate ?' ` `I ony guess him, massa.' ` Well, I am Captain o' this barky.' `Beg pardon, massy Capting, I does; I berry sorry I didn't know it afore.' `No matter, so you know it now. But let out your hawser. Don't be so long wearing round.' ` You interrup's me, massy.' ` Well, I wants to have you start shipshape. Now give her the helm.' ,` Well, I is a West Indgy nigger, massy Capting, and I belonged to a massa French planter, live near de Havanna. Well, one day, 'bout two year and half ago, comes into de port a 'Merikam frigate, and my master invites de ossifers to dine, coz my massy hab marry a Yankee lady, and he berry much like de 'Merican. Dey all come out to dinner in carriage and on horseback.' ` I got cast away on one o' them animals, once, out in Cuby. He wouldn't mind the helm; and though I held him by the fore-stays, as the lubber as let me have him told me, he got the wind o' me and there was no bringing him under short canvas after that. I braced my legs in the main-chains, both sides o' the saddle and got hold o' his tail to keep him steady, seein' he veered and hauled amazing and didn't keep the channel.— At last he took a lee lurch, dove bows under, stern up in the air, and sent me three fathom over the bulwarks on the road side into a corn-field.' `Horses is berry dangerous,' responded Cæsar, shaking his head. `These ossifers came out on horses and got there safe to dinner. There was to be a large party in de ebenin' and massa hearin' 'em tell a story 'bout a young seaman as had been the first to board an English frigate, and had disarmed the Cap'n and tuk him prisoner, besides strikin' the colors wid his own hand—Massa said he must come to de party too!' `In course. That master of yours was a true gentleman, darkee. That was a brave tar. Do you know his name?' `It was massa Archy, my master as is now.' `The same that sent the oranges to the captain?' `Yis, de same.' `How came he to be your master?' `I'll tell you, afore long. Soon as my old massa say dat he like to see de young sailor, de first ossifer write a short billet, and massa gib it me and tell me ride fast as I can go to the city and go board and giv de note to de leutenant.' `The officer of the deck. And you did?' `It was only four mile, and I soon dere and aboard ob de ship. I pressents de note to de ossifer ob deck and he reads it, and den calls out a name; and a young man comes dressed berry neat, for dey had made him someting under a midshipman, aboard. `You is wanted on shore, it seems,' said the ossifer, smiling as he handed him de note.— `You'll have to put yourself in trim, as there's a ball!' He couldn't believe he was invited, but the ossifer told him he was, and he must go! So he got ready and went wid me; and when we got ashore and on horseback, he asks me a great many questions all 'bout master, and why he was sent for; and I told him, coz I liked him berry much indeed.— And afore we got dere, he seeemed to like me berry much.' `And what did he do when he got there?' `Why he seemed a little modest-like at first; but master made much of him, and treated him so like a gentleman, he soon felt as much at home as his ossifers; and they seemed to like to have him there, for he was a 'varsal favorite board the frigate! Well, massa somehow took a great liking to him, and told him he must come out again and dine with him; and all the handsome ladies thought a great deal of him; for every body knew he had been so brave, and the first to board the frigate and haul down the colors!' `That's enough to make a gentleman of any man. The ladies al'ays likes courage, darkee l' `Yiss, I thinks they does. Well, the frigate was in port three weeks, and jist afore she was to sail he was tuk down ashore with yellow-fever. The frigate had to go, and left him; but the ossifer wrote to my master, and we went right in and brought him out home and nussed him, He was berry sick for two months, but by and by got well, and wanted to go and join his ship; but it would be two months afore it was expected back.— Master and he rode out ebbery day, and master seemed to like him as if he was his son. I tuk care of him all the time he was sick, and berry much loved him, he was so good and kind. `One day, massa came ridin' home bleed n' in the arm. Three men had 'tacked him, who wanted to kill him, for they were his enemies; and if massa Archy —' `That was the young sailor who had been on his beam ends sick!' `Yis. If he hadn't been brave as a lion and killed one out-right and fought the others till they ran, master'd been killed sure, as he said to us. You don't know how he praised him, and said he owed his life to him. At length the frigate came back, and he said he must go. Massa would have kep' him, but he said he must not stay another day away from the ship. I then wanted to go with him, for I had become berry much 'tached to him; and he was berry sorry to have to leave me! And what you tink master do?' `Gave you to him, as was proper.' `Dat was just it. He told me, if I loved his young deliverer so much, I might go with him and take care of him in danger. Massa Archy didn't know of dis till I show myself to him board de ship. He den want me to go back, but I wouldn't stir; and when de ossifer come to know 'bout how it was, he said I should stay and do what I could board de frigate.' `So you staid!' `Yiss; and I nebber hab lef massa Archy from dat day to dis. He hab save my life four time, and I hab save him life twice, coz we seen good many fights on de sea l' `What frigate was you in?' `De Eagle frigate!' `I've heard about her cruises. She made a good many captures.' `Yis massa, dat she did! But we was in two oder vessels besides! Now, Massa Cap'n, I b'leives I must go!' `You haint told me how you happened to come here abouts armed with this here spanish knife and long soger's spit.' `I haint time, now, Massa. I ony jist tell you dat —' `You must explain all ship-shape.— How do I know but you want to kill me and run off with the barky? Come shipmates, make all square and veer out your talkin' tackle. Here's another sup o' grog.' `Tankee, massa! Dis am berry nice beberage.' `To be sure it is. I haint been eight and twenty years at sea not to know how to mix grog, especially to suit a niggar.' `It bery good, massa.' `Now let's hear the end o' your story.' `Wall you see, massa, arter we left Havanna and cruised about on de ocean we puts into Rio Janeiro. Dere we found another 'Merican sloop-o'-war, de Lexinwille.' `Lexington, you mean, darkee.' `Dat precise de name, massa. Well, dere was parties on shore, and one night dere was a smashin' great ball at de Emp'ror's palace.' `I've seen that.' `Hab you?' `To be sure I have! Ask me what place that a barky can sail into on the globe I haint been in, and drank grog in. I've seen the Emperor's palace and his black guards, blast their eyes. Five on 'em chased me and a messmate to our boat one night, coz we keeled over a Portuguee shop-keeper as wanted to cheat us out of our money's worth. Jist as I was takin' the last leap for the boat, one of their baggonets caught me under the waistband a-starn and sent me clean afinto the coxswain's lap, keel up.' `Well, dat was a berry 'markable escape. De night de ball was, all our ossifers went ashore in long-togs and eppylets, and chapos, and swords at their sides—' `That's party riggin' all the world over. You needn't tell me that.' `I likes to be tikkalar. Well, some how or order when do ossifers was goin' to dair boats dere was a row wid de black sogers, who wanted to get money out of em for lettin' em go through de gate to de mole. Our orsifers showed fight, but were forced to their boats, but dey brought off de Portugee Cap'n prisoner. Somehows in de darkness Massa Archy and I got in de boat as belonged to the sloop-o'-war and didn't know it till we'd pulled off.' `Then he went to the hall?' `Yis, dat he did, for he messed wid de middies though he want one; but the Captain said he must, for he'd have him a middy soon as he got to the states, for de skipper like Massa Archy bery great deal. Finding he was in de wrong boat, Massa Archy said he'd keep on, and go aboard de sloop first, and den be put aboard de frigate. Well, when we got aboard, as Massa Archy was passing de marine as was sentry at de gangway, he no sooner saw de marine, den he speak his name out with surprise; but neider spoke to each oder, ony de marine look black as em thunder when he see Massa Archy treated as equal by the ossifers.' `Who was the marine?' `Why you see it was a love matter.— Massa Archy and he hab love de same young Misses, and her fader say dat neider ob em shall hab her till de war was ober, and den he gib her to him as 'stinguished himself de bravest! Dat was de reason de soger when he see Massa Archy look so black.' `I understand. He was only a marine, and seeing the other a gentleman-like, it riled his bilge-water.' `Dat it did! Well, I cant tell you all what happened arterwards, but may be I'll spin the yarn some oder time; but I jiss wants to inform you dat when I was coming from your Massa Captain's up dere, wid dis bag, I meets dis berry marine.' `The very soger as stood sentry and hated your master?' `De cozact man, massa. He try to keep him face hid, but I 'cognise him, and he axes me berry quisitive kestions bout my master, as I didn't like. I did not choose to answer him, coz I know'd he'd try to do Massa Archy a mischief ob some kind, if he could come across him. He den got mad, coz I wouldn't tell him where Massa Archy was, and draw his sword and I draws my knife; and I gets his sword afore he could pink me, and den chases him up de bank.— But he run too fast for dis niggar and so I came to my skiff when your big dog grab me by de jacket and axes me what I doin dar. Den you come and dat's de end ob de story, massa Cap'n.' `It's a strait yarn, nigger. I see you be an honest fellow.' `To be sartain I is, massa.' `Then I'll give you up your weapons. Now take another sup of grog. It is very dry work reeving off talk.' `Dat it am. massa;' responded Cæsar smacking his lips as he returned the tin cup to Jack. `But I felt it to be berry necessary duty for me to tell you bout dis man, coz he's skulking bout here, and he berry bad man; for I did'nt tell you how he like to kill me and Massa Archy dead.' `No. How was it?' `I cant stop now, massa. I ony say dat he bery ebil man, and if you sees him cruising about here, keep your eye on him.' `Yes and set the dog on him too.— Who was the young lady your master and this chap was trimming their sails in chase of?' `Why bress you, Massa, is was de butiful Miss Blanche, up dare!' responded Cæsar in a low, confidential tone; for the grog had made him quite communicative. `What the old Captain's handsome daughter?' `Yiss. Didn't I tell you that my young Massa had sent her a bag ob oranges.' `I heard something about such shipping papers being drawn up between the old Captain and two young sparks, but I disremembered the names. What is the name of the other barkey?' `Nelson Osborne.' `I'll log him down in my memory.— You say he went up by the block-house?' `Yis, massa.' `Well, I'll just make sail and give chase. If he's such a pirate-craft as you say, he haint no business coming about Miss Blanche. I'm glad I fell in with you, Cæsar! You say your master has done bravely through the war!' `He hab been berry 'stinguished;— But when he and de Capting hab a talk to-morrow, den I hab de liberty of telling you all about it.' `So he's coming up to-morrow?' `Yis, for sartain.' `We are all bound on a fishing-cruise to-morrow! Tell him if he keeps a sharp eye on the river he'll discover us; and if he is on the shore let him hail; or if he is in a boat to bear along side. I love to see a brave tar as well as any body. Now I'll just weigh and make after that marine as you gave chase to! CHAPTER VIII. THE FLOOD AND THE RESCUE. When Nelson Osborne, for it was he, as the reader has discovered, who way-laid Cesar, had effected his escape from him up the bank, he stopped to take breath under the walls of the old block-house. His bosom burned with the fiercest passions of rage and mortification. He cursed his carelessness in having betrayed his person to the negro, in his eagerness to learn where Archibald Worthington was, and his want of skill in losing his sword, and thus being compelled to fly from the negro like a coward. But Nelson Osborne was no coward. He had showed his courage not only in his rescue conjointly with Archibald of Blance, but he had shown it in the war. It will not be out of place here to bring before the reader more particularly the events which preceded the opening of our story, and which led to the rivalship of the two young men. They were both sons of parents in moderate circumstances, and of respectable rank in society. They were only sons, and their mothers became widows when they were yet mere lads. The mother of Archibald moved to the town below Augusta, and there educated her son with the narrow means her circumstances permitted. Nelson remained in Augusta, and as the lads were intimate, they alternately visited each other from week to week. In this way they grew up to be young men; Nelson fond of pleasure, passing his time in gunning, fishing, and sailing on the river; while Archibald was inclined both to books and labor; and by making occasional trips in the packets, for he had a passion for the sea, he relieved his mother of the burden of his sports even ere he had reached his seventeenth year, and sometimes was able out of his wages to bring her a present of a dress or new cap from Boston. But Nelson thought little of alleviating his widowed mother's toils for his maintenance. He never earned anything for himself, but on the contrary did not blush to borrow of her, when he needed it for his pleasure, money out of her narrow income. The residence of Nelson's mother was in an humble cottage, just below the rapid, and whenever Archibald visited him the two young men used to pass the day together fishing for salmon in the swift current, or more adventurous carrying their skiff above the cataracts, dart over them with arrowy rapidity, and not without imminent peril from the hidden rocks and wild turmoil of the foaming waters. One day Archibald was on a visit to his friend after an absence of several weeks on a voyage to Charleston. He had brought home money for his mother, and gladdened her heart by his habits of industry, and the proof he gave of integrity and love of virtue. He was in fine spirits, and although he did not altogether approve of the character of his old friend and school-mate, as it began to be developed, as he approached manhood, still from habit he visited him. On the occasion in question a spring rain had raised the river to a fearful height, and drifts mingled with masses of ice were driving furiously past the town. Archibald was standing in the door of Nelson's house, watching the huge logs and cakes of ice leap the rapids, or shoot through the narrow passages with loud road and the exhibition of tremendous power. While he was gazing he saw what appeared to be a house coming down above the falls. `It is a horse,' exclaimed Nelson, to whom he pointed it out. `The river is rising fast to float houses off. The bridge at Waterville will be sure to come down before night.' `Let us go higher up, and from the bluff over-looking the rapids, get a better view of the river. I have never seen anything so sublime, except a storm at sea, when the waves seemed to run mad, and like living monsters, try to swallow up our vessel. The two young men hastened up the narrow path, and going round the rapids, ascended a bold eminence that commanded the whole wild scene, and gave them a view of the river for some distance above and below them. While they stood there, the house they had seen came along upon the current, and was borne swiftly towards the verge of the foaming rapids. It rolled and whirled round as it drew nearer, and then with a loud crash was hurled over the cataract, and all was ruin. In a few seconds aftewards a hundred fragments were seen by them tossed over the boiling waters far below the falls. `I am thankful there was no person in that house,' said Archibald. `There would have been no escape for a human being. `See, there comes a cow,' cried Nelson, and a horse too, is struggling for his life, just behind her. Poor animals. Their fate is sealed. Hear how the cow lowes, and turns her head this way and that, with such wild fear, as she strives to reach the shore. But mark the horse. He seems to be conscious of the fate that awaits him. See how he leaps half his length out of the water, as he tries to reach the shore. Now he has thrown his fore feet upon a floating log. But he knows it is destined to the same vortex which awaits him, and he leaves it. Nearer and nearer they draw to their fate. Hear the plaintive lowings of the cow. Now it is all over with her. There she plunges and disappears in the fearful waters. Oh! that I could save the horse. `No mortal man can do it. What a shriek?' `It was his death-cry. There he goes over? See how he bounds half his body's length out into the air, as he goes over the smoothly rolling verge. But it is his last effort for life. He has shared the fate of the poor cow.' `And of every living thing that happens to be adrift on this river above the falls,' said Nelson, with an oath. `Look! The bridge! The bridge!' cried a hundred voices. All eyes were directed to a point up the river, about a mile and a half distant, and there was indeed the half of a bridge floating down. `It is the Waterville,' cried several voices. `God grant no human soul was on it when it was carried away,' said a poor woman near. There could be no help for any body.' That is true, 'ma'am,' said Archibald: `but what object is that floating near the fragment of the bridge,' he asked of those around him, as the wreck was borne rapidly nearer. `There is certainly something living moving its arms upon it.' `It is a man!' exclaimed several voices; for a member of persons had assembled upon the eminence to see the flooded river in its power, and watch the mad leaping of the logs and wrecks of fences over the rapids. `It is a human being,' a hundred tongues echoed, with thrilling pathos. `It looks like a woman.' `She is floating on a couch,' cried others. Archibald looked for an instant steadily at the distant object on which all eyes were directed, before he could convince himself that it was a human being, for it was still half a mile distant. But he was no sooner convinced of the fact, that a fellow being was destined to imminent destruction, than he resolved to risk his life to attempt to save him, and when he saw, as in a moment after it was plain to see, that it was a female who was so dangerously situated, than his spirit was resolved what to do. `Nelson,' he cried to his friend, `I see a skiff that two men have just drawn up to the bank there to secure it. Let us run down the hill, launch it, and push out into the river, and, if possible, save her!' `It will be madness,' cried Nelson. `No power can avert her fate, young man,' cried two or three persons near him. `You will only share it,' cried others. `I will at least make the attempt if I have to go alone,' he answered, and the next moment he was bounding down the steep hill-side towards the river's brink, and in the direction of a skiff, which two men had just before drawn out of the reach of the water, and left on the bank two hundred yards above the rapids. `You are mad, Worthington,' cried Nelson, following him to deter him from risking his life. `I cannot stand quietly and see the poor woman perish before my eyes, Nelson,' answered Archibald, as his friend came up with him. `Go with me. If we can't reach her in time, we can regain the shore: and at least shall have the satisfaction of having made the effort.' `If you go you will be taken over the falls.' `I shall nevertheless make the attempt to reach her,' he answered, still hurrying along the beach as he talked. `It is Captain Talbot's daughter.' `It is Blanche Talbot!' was now suddenly echoed from lip to lip; and the words fell on the ears of the young men, as they reached the skiff. `Then I will save her or perish,' exclaimed Archibald with resolution. `And I will go with you, Archey,' answered Nelson, who was now all animation. Without saying a word to the two men who stood on the bank just above their skiff, the two young men, as if obeying one impulse, and actuated by the same spirit lifted, each one end of the skiff, and launched it into the current. Archibald saw the two oars laid across the limb of a tree close at hand, and taking them down, he leaped into the boat, followed by Nelson. They each grasped an oar, and boldly pushed out into the stream. The floating carriage was about a third of a mile above them, and they about two hundred yards above the rapids. With the swiftness with which the bridge and coach came down, they saw that in less than five minutes the fate of Blanche Talbot, whom they now plainly recognised, would be sealed. Both of them were already unknown to each other, and unknown to Blanche, her admirers; and when they were assured that it was she who was exposed to such peril, their spirits seemed to be new created, and their strength to be supernatural! Giving themselves with all their souls to their daring effort for her preservation, they began to ascend the stream near the shore, where the current was weakest, encouraged by the shouts of some, and warned by the cries of others, who witnessed in amazement and terror, this fearless enterprize. The attention of the people on both shores was now divided, between the coach and the skiff, with its two brave oarsmen. The object of all this excitement, and almost mad exposure of life, on the part of the two young men, was standing upon the top of a coach that was but a few inches above the water.— At intervals she would wave her arms towards the shore, but no cry escaped her. Suddenly, as the coach came into a turbulent part of the river it began to rock, and they saw her stoop down to hold firmly on, in order to prevent being thrown off into the river. The effort she made in doing so, tilted the coach, and it turned over with her, casting her into the water. A loud outcry, accompanied with shrieks and groans, rose from the spectators at seeing this, and every one expected she would perish there, ere she reached the rapids; but the next instant every eye was gladdened at her re-appearance after sinking for a moment, and again beheld her clinging to the side of the carriage. There was a loud shout of joy at seeing this, but it subsided into a deep moan of grief at the reflection that her safety was only for a few moments. `Poor child,' said one; `it is but a minute's reprieve. For my part I wish it was all over with her! Oh, what will become of her poor father, who loved her so much.' `See the skiff!' cried fifty voices; `it has now got up even with the coach, and they are pulling strait out into the river.' `Only to die too with her!' said many. `Look how they pull. They make their boat fairly jump. See! How they bend to their oars and make it fly over the water.' `Courage!' `Brave men! onward!' `Onward! You may save her!' `Pull away for your lives!' `Don't give up!' `On! on! on! Row faster! row for your lives! There, they are getting near her! See! What strength and steadiness! There is no flinch to them! They will save her! Heave a-head! Make her fly! That is it! Bravo! They will save her yet! Only two rods more! Pull! pull! A few more strokes!' cried and shouted again a score of men, whose bodies and hands moved with those of the rowers. `A half a dozen hard pulls, my brave fellows!' `Row! row! row!' `There they are!' `They have got her!' `They have saved her!' `She is in their boat!' cried five hundred tongues, as the young men shot their skiff along side the coach-body, and Archibald Worthington leaping upon it caught Blanche in his arms, and, aided by Nelson, lifted her into the skiff. `She is safe!' filled the air like a thunder peal. But the universal excitement of joy at the success of the two bold young men, in their daring achievment, gave instantly place to emotion of the liveliest apprehension. For the moment they had rejoiced in an apparent rescue; but an instants reflection showed the multitude that their joy was without just foundation; that Blanche Talbot instead of being rescued had only united with her two more hapless victims to be hurled into the destruction towards which she had been borne alone. `There are three deaths instead of one!' cried several of the women who looked on wringing their hands. `There will be mourning in three houses this night, instead of one!' But the words of sorrow and fear were silenced by the intense excitement of the scene that now drew all eyes, and held still the beating of all hearts. The young men had no sooner taken the scarcely alive Blanche into their boat and placed her humbly, but gently in the stern, than they sprang to their oars again, which had not been hardly thirty seconds out of their hands. `Keep heart, Blanche,' said Archibald, as he saw her look fearfully forward at the roaring rapids. `You ought not. You ought to have let me perished alone!' she faltered. `No, Blanche. If you perish I perish with you!' he answered. `But there is yet hope. The rapids are full a quarter of a mile below us! Give way, Nelson! Let us strain every nerve now, indeed; for we have now her safety in our own hands!' `We will save her if we die for it,' answered Nelson, as he bent strongly to his oar. `To the other shore, Not to the one we started from,' had been Archibald's words, as soon as he had removed Blanche from the coach into the skiff; and thither, to the east shore, the boat fairly flew. It was at least one hundred and fifty yards nigher than the one they had started from. The foam curled about the bows of their strongly propelled skiff and deluged them with water. At each stroke both of the young men fairly rose to their feet, and then threw themselves backwards with all their weight They displayed astonishing strength and skill. The least error, or awkwardness, or feathering of an oar might have been fatal. As fast as they urged their frail bark shoreward, it was borne downward by the fierce current in the direction of the roaring cataracts. The noise of the dashing waters below them grew louder and louder. Each instant they felt that they were going towards the verge like an arrow. It was a fearful race between the speed of the wild river and that of their little boat. It was a contest between human strength and energy, and the power of the elements. The excitement of the crowds on shore, as they watched the terrible struggle of the oars-men, was intense. They stood looking with breathless silence. If one spoke others would hush him. It was not a time for words. The anxiety and suspense were too awful. The prospects of the skiff's reaching the shore was doubtful; indeed, no one believed it could, though all hoped, and a hundred prayers went up to Heaven to aid the rowers. The young men saw all their danger. They calculated at a glance the distance between the shore, and safety, and the rapids, and ruin. They felt that the chances were very few in their favor. But the sense of their danger. The sight of the lovely girl in the boat who seemed, with her earnest looks and clasped hands, to implore them to save her; the encouraging shouts from the shore that suddenly broke the silence, as Jack, the well known Jack he was called, with a coil rope in his hand came bounding down the bank and stationed himself on a projecting timber, stood ready to throw it if they should come near enough. All this inspired them, and aided their efforts already super-human. `Don't give up yet. Pull a little harder, if you can,' called out an old packet-captain. `There is a chance yet.— Never give up. Break your oars, my lads, so you get here safely.' `Pull now.' `Oh, for a few seconds more time.' `One minute more.' `See how swiftly the river takes them down. It will take them over before they can reach the shore.' `For your lives, men. For your lives.' `They do their best. God help them. `Amen.' `They are gone. They are lost!' shrieked a thousand tongues. `Hurrah! Hilloh! Hurrah! Well done!' was the next moment filling the whole sky like an army's shout of victory. `Well done.' `They are save!' `Thank God! They are all three saved!' `Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!' shouted, with shout upon shout, the joyful multitude, as the next moment the hats and oars from the skiff shotl ike an arrow over the verge, and disappeared in the vortex of wild waters. CHAPTER IX. THE QUARREL. The cause of the sudden change of the cry, `All are lost,' to the shouts of joy and the cries of `Well done,' `Bravely done,' and the means by which those in the skiff were finally rescued, were owing to Jack's courage and presence of mind. As he stood on the extremity of a fallen tree with the rope coiled ready for a throw, he perceived that the current was stronger than their oars, and they would inevitably be carried over the falls before they could come within catching distance of his rope, though it was fifty feet long. There was not a moment left for hesitation. The distance between the skiff, and the rolling verge of the rapids, was equal, and the strength of the rowers was failing, while that of the river gained power as it approached the leap. Jack, with the prompt action which characterises seamen, and which had led him at the first to hasten for the rope, on learning that there was some one being carried down the river, (for your true tar has great faith in a rope in all dangers,) no sooner saw that they would inevitably be carried over the cataract, than he secured with a double turn one end round the tree, and the other about his body beneath his arms. This was the work of an instant. He then sprung out into the river as far as he could leap, crying to those on the shore, `to stand by to pull him in.' He boldly struck out so as to meet the skiff, as it was driving fast down the stream, and as it passed him he caught hold of it with an iron grasp, first with one hand and then with the other.' All now for a moment, a single moment, depended on his individual exertion. Archibald, with great presence of mind, dropped his oar on seeing that he held fast, and cast the boats' painter over his shoulders, and took a turn rapidly round the forward thwart. This bound the boat to the brave sailor, who in his turn was held to the land by the rope, which he had tied to the tree. At this there were already half a dozen of stout men pulling, and the skiff was dragged, Jack and all, bodily through the foaming water to the shore. A dozen of men sprang into the water, to draw the boat up to a safe spot. A thousand voices shouted with exultation, and the names of the brave young men and the daring sailor, were on every lip in accents of praise. Captain Talbot who stood on the shore silently watching the whole scene, but without the power to speak or give an order, now caught his daughter to his heart, and aloud thanked Heaven for her escape. He grasped the hands of the two young men, and wept with joy over them. `You have saved my child. God bless you, for I cannot reward you,' and then he turned from them to clasp his child once more to his breast. A hundred hands were extended to shake the hands of the brave young men, and of Jack, whose presence of mind and courage, contributed to their ultimate safety, and the friends and acquaintances of the father crowded around him with the warmest congratulations. That was, indeed, a day long to be remembered by those who witnessed the scenes we have described. The towns-people thought that no language could sufficiently express the courageous and fearless conduct of the two young men. They could not for weeks afterwards pass the streets without being pointed out to those who did not know them, and their names pronounced with that reverence, which all men pay to true courage, when exercised in the cause of humanity. If the towns-folk had reason to remember the exciting events of that day, much more so had the two young men. The success of their enterprise for her rescue, and the dangers they had shared with her, could not but make an impression upon their minds, and deeply interest them in a beautiful girl, whose life they had been instrumental in saving; even though they had never beheld her before. But both of them had known her from boyhood. They had grown up and been at school with her, till she was removed from the `mixed school,' to one for girls exclusively. They both thought her the prettiest maiden in town, and when togethey they often talked about her, bvt without any rivalry. Indeed each concealed from the other, the true depth of his interest in her. She, however, regarded neither of them with any marked favor; though she had been heard to say to one of her youthful, confidential friends, that she thought that Archibald Worthington was the handsomest youth, and the most polite, mannorly person, she had ever seen. Such was the state of feeling of the parties when the danger in which Blanche had been placed, and her rescue, gave a more decided form and shape to the previously existing partiality felt by the young men for her. It was a matter of course that both of them should call at the old captain's the very same evening of the rescue, to ask after her welfare; for her alarm and exposure, had rendered her almost insensible—and when her father received her from them, she fainted in his arms. The old captain met them beneath his own roof with a hearty welcome, and a warm embrace. He told them again and again, how happy they had made him; for his daughter he had loved dearer than any object on earth. From him they learned the cause of the accident which had placed her life in such peril. It seems she had been a few miles up the river with her aunt, on a visit of two or three days to a relation's house, and when returning, as they went, in the stage, they two, being the only passengers, had hastened their return home on account of the rise in the river, fearing the roads would be impassable in the lower places, if they delayed. On reaching the bridge, the river was nearly on on a level with the floor, and the driver hesitated whether to cross or not; but as it was a very strong bridge, and looked firm, he resolved to make the attempt —and, whipping up his horses dashed forward. He had, however, got but half way across when a loud cracking behind them, told them of the peril they were in. The driver had only time to shout and tell them to save themselves, and to leap from his box. Aunt Sarah at the same instant, sprung from the window, and followed the driver, who was flying over the upheaving timbers to the pier, which stood firm—while all the bridge besides was undulating and breaking up, and plunging in huge sections into the flood. Blanche had got out immediately after her aunt, and attempted to fly to the security of the pier, but the crashing and heaving of the planks and timbers around her appalled her. While the horses, terrified, were struggling over the breaking floor, and at length clearing themselves from the coach, dashed together over the sinking parapet and were crushed among the parting rafters.— Blanche, amid this scene of ruin, was afraid to move a step from the coach; and giving herself up for lost, she instinctively clung to it, as it was launched into the stream by the sudden plunge, and submersion of the fragment of the bridge on which she stood. It struck the water without turning over, and getting upon it, she began to hope yet to escape. But as she found herself borne rapidly down the dark, wild river, amid a field of floating timber, trees, cattle, and dwellings, and shattered boats, she felt that there was little hope that she should ever tread the solid land once more.— She was carried down between dark wooded banks, amid forest scenery, and part cultivated farms with the same rapidity, and the same absence of all aid. She saw people on the shore, and some waved their hands, and bade her keep courage, though for want of boats they could not help her. Some ran along by the bank for miles to find a skiff, till obstructions on the shore or fatigue compelled them to give up and leave her to her fate. And this fate, she believed, would be death! She knew that unless some one came off to her aid before she reached the rapids, which were seventeen miles below the place where she had been thrown from the falling bridge, she should perish. At length, after she had been nearly three hours upon the top of the drifting coach, she came in sight of her native town. She now began to revive her torpid faculties, and tried to hope for life yet. As she was borne onward she waved her hands, for she saw the people on the hills; but she could not cry for the aid she so eloquently implored by her gestures. She prayed that God would send some strong arm to deliver her, and then committed herself to her fate.' The reader already knows how wonderfully that fate was averted. The young men listened to this account given to them by the Captain, with deep interest. When at length Blanche entered the room, and thanked them for what they had done for her with so natural feeling and hearty gratitude, they both felt that they were more than repaid for the risk they had run. Aunt Sarah, who had been taken from the pier with no little danger by men in boats, and who had given her niece up as lost, was scarcely less warm in her expressions of thankfulness to them. From this day the house of the old Captain became a very frequent visiting place for the two young gentlemen; and they were always received by Blanche and her farher with that kindness which the service they had done them commanded should be extended to them, even though they should have possessed no agreable qualities in themselves to recommend them. But these they did possess. Nelson Osborne was lively, full of anecdote, and could make himself very entertaining, especially to the elder persons. Indeed, he seemed to have far less faculty for pleasing a young lady than Archibald Worthingham, to whose conversation Blanche was always a very deeply interested listener; for Archibald was well educated, had seen something of the world, and quited to natural intelligence, he had improved in the best manner all his advantages. He had taste in poetry, painting and flowers, and was skilled as well in graver and more substantial studies. Blanche, young, ardent, and susceptible, felt his superiority and power, and willingly lent her ear to his words till they had stolen away her heart. Nelson Osborne was not long in discovering that Blanche very clearly preferred his society to his own. He saw that while he was entertaining the Captain with some humorous story, either made up, or embellished for the occasion, and while he and Aunt Sarah were laughing most heartily at it, Blanche and Archibald were talking together in a low tone by the window, or rather, the latter talking, and the former listening, with her eyes fixed with sweet attention upon his face. Nelson saw that he was losing ground in trying to win the daughter by pleasing the old people, and that Archibald, trusting to his own native powers, to truth, and the sincerity of his deep-rooted love, was winning the prize he had resolved should be his own. There is no passion that so soon awakens the evil in a man's heart as jealousy. A look, a word, nay, a suspicion will kindle the spark, and brooding thought will act upon it like oil. `Archy,' said Nelson, as they walked home together that night, `you seem to be getting along finely with Blanche! wish you would not try to win her heart in that way! This was said with a sort of sullen reproach. `Indeed, and why not, Nelson?' said Archy laughing, for those may laugh who win says the proverb, and so thought Archy; for he knew by the looks of Blanche's eyes that she loved him, if not as well as he loved her, almost as well. `Why not; because I intend some day to marry her! `You do?' `Yes, I have made up my mind to that, and I don't want you to cross my path!' `There are two sides to that subject, Nelson,' answered Archy pleasantly; though he saw that his friend was not in the best of humors. `Well, one side I mean to stand to, and that is my side! I loved Blanche Talbot before you ever thought of her! You wouldn't have thought about her, if it hadn't been that you helped me save her!' `That you helped me, rather! But no matter; I shall not tell you when I first thought about Blanche; let it suffice for you to know, Nelson, that I do think about her.' `Then the sooner you cease to think about her the better!' This was spoken in such a menacing and decided way, that Archibald stopped and looking him full in the face, said, `Are you in earnest, Osborne?' `I never was more so! I love Blanche Talbot and no other man shall love her if I can help it!' `And suppose you can't help it,' asked Archibald quietly. `I will help it; I am not to be cut out by your blarney with her, Worthington, and you need not think so. If you don't want to quarrel with me, you will never call there again.' `I shall call to-morrow, certainly, for I have promised to go with Blanche to make a call.' `She has said she will go?' `Yes.' `Archibald Worthington, I tell you once for all, if you go with her, you make me your mortal enemy!' `I shall not disappoint Blanche, you may be assured,' answered Archibald firmly. The two young men here parted, for they had by this time crossed the bridge. They parted without one word of `good night,' and on Osborne's part in high anger. Archibald felt rather like being 4 amused at his friend's angry bearing and menaces, yet still regretted the misunderstanding between them. But as to giving up Blanche, he had no such idea, but was rather confirmed in his purpose to woo and win her if possible. Their conversation, which had been carried on in rather a louder tone than was necessary, was overheard by the old toll-keeper who was seated in his door smoking his pipe, and it being deep twilight he was not observed, though he saw and heard them; and as the Captain when he crossed the bridge always used to stop and gossip with the toll-man, so the next morning when he lingered to exchange with him the news, the old toll-gatherer said, `Why, neighbor, so I see your pretty daughter is like to prove an apple of contention between the two brave young men who saved her life a few weeks ago.' `Ah, how is that? how is that?' asked Captain Talbot quickly. `I have suspected something of the kind: but what have you heard?' `Why you see, as town-folks don't pay toll only by the quarter and come and go as they please, I often in the evening, as I sit in my door, hear a good deal more talk than folks intend, especially as the bridge echoes; and so last night just as it was growing dark I was seated here in my door smoking, when I heard two persons coming across and talking smartly loud. I soon heard 'em mention your da'ater's name, and know'd one o' the voices, the loudest to be be that o' Nelson Osborne!' `And what did he say of my child?' `Nothing!' it was a quarrel I found about her, between Osborne and Archibald Worthington. I don't say Archy was quarrelling, it was on the side o' Nelson, so far as I could hear it. Nelson said Archibald must give up all thoughts of your daughter or he'd make him his enemy and would rue it; which Archy answers that he shall not be governed by the other's wishes but do as he pleases. Nelson was tremendously angry as they went by me, and just here by the post, at the bridge end, they parted in such a way that I shouldn't wonder if, when they met again, they should come to blows about her.' `I'll see to that. I'll forbid them both my house, if Blanche does owe her life to them. Do they think because they saved her from drowning that she belongs to them, like a piece of drift wood picked up in the river. I'll teach the young gentlemen another way to box their compass.' `It wan't Archy, capting. He didn't seem to be to blame or quarrelling; it was all Nelson who wanted him to say he would never go to your house again, because he wanted a clear coast for himself, you see; and he was mad with Archy because he said he would go as often as he pleased. He wouldn't be bullied, you see.' `And he was right. But I shall have to treat 'em both alike. I'll send for 'em both to come and see me to-morrow and I'll have a talk with em, that'll bring 'em in stays, I reckon. You will oblige me, neighbour Soule, not to speak of this to any one.' `No, I wont, if you say so, capting.' `I shall settle the matter with them with a round turn, before Nelson Osborne is a day older.' With these words the captain pursued his way into the village street. CHAPTER X. THE TWO ASPIRANTS. The result of the conversation held by the old sea-captain with the toll-gatherer is already known to the reader. As the captain resolved so he proceeded to excute. He sent early the next morning an invitation to the two young men to come and see him at twelve o'clock, as he had something particular to say to them. The message was verbal and Jack the messenger that bore it; but he was saved a walk of two miles by meeting Archibald on the way to call upon Blanche, as he had told Nelson he should do, The captain was seated in his leathern arm-chair, talking with Blanche, when Jack was seen approaching, accompanied by Archibald. `Well, Blanche,' said the captain, `you can now go and look after the dinner; I have a few words to say to Master Worthington, who I see is coming over the green. You are a good girl to give up so readily your promised walk with him, but I'll clear you to him; and as I have found out from you in our little talk here, that you are not particularly disposed to have either of them—' `I did not say either of them, father. I said that I did not think because they saved my life they ought to claim my hand. But I had Nelson only in my thought when I spoke.' `I see! I see! You think that Archibald may pretend to your hand, but not Nelson. A manifest partiality.' `Indeed—dear father—I—' Here Blanche blushed and stammered, for she felt she had betrayed herself farther than she intended. `Don't look so guilty, child. It is nothing remarkable that you should prefer one to the other. But their claims are equal to your hand, if they are really serious in seeking it; I must treat them both alike. But here comes Worthington in at the door; and I would rather he should not see you. There, too, is Nelson hastening this way across the bridge. I will find out their intentions and come to a perfect understanding with them before they leave the house.' `Don't say anything, father, that will make me appear foolish.' `Leave it with me, child. I shall look after your interests and happiness. I am not going to have two young men fighting about you, when I can put them on good terms with one another and make all fair and above board. Good bye. After they are gone I'll see you again and let you know how the wind blows.' Blanche now hastened from the room, for the step of Archibald was now upon the threshold. The outer door was left open, and entering the passage he tapped lightly on the inner window. `Come in,' called out the captain.— `Ah, Master Worthington, I am glad to see you,' he added, as Archibald came into the room with a smile and a glance round as if he expected to see the sunny face of Blanche. `How do you do today?' and the captain extended his hand. `I am well, captain,' answered the young man, who looked disappointed at not seeing the maiden, but grasped the captain's hand and took the seat opposite to him, to which he pointed him. `You have got my message soon.' `Jack met me, sir. I was coming up to fulfil an appointment with Blanche to go with her to Mrs. Wilson's.' `Blanche begs to be excused, Archibald.' `I hope she is not ill, sir.' `Oh, no! But, to tell you the truth, young gentleman, and speak my mind bluntly, like an old sailor, I don't think that it is exactly the thing for a young girl to be cruising about with a young gentleman. We are always glad to see you,—of late your attentions, as well as those of Master Osborne, are getting to be too particular unless—that is unless—' Here the captain hesitated for a word. `Unless they love her, sir; let me add, and I do love her, sir; and, captain Talbot, if you will give me your consent I wish to make her my wife, if I can obtain her own.' `That is plain talk, and coming to the point, Master Archibald; and I like to see you so frank and sincere. You could not have said more in fewer words. But there is another claimant for her hand.' `Who, sir?' asked Archibald, quickly. `Nelson Osborne, your friend. He seems to think his claim for the maiden's hand quite as strong as your own, if what I see and observe and hear be true. But here he comes to answer for himself.' `While the captain was speaking the young man came in without rapping; when seeing Arcbibald he frowned darkly, and half drew back as if he could not endure to be in the same room with his rival. `Come in and sit down, Master Osborne. I have sent for you and Archi bald to have a little talk with you. Come sir, don't show any angry feelings here. Blanche is not a bone for two dogs to fight about.' `Fight, sir,' repeated Nelson, haughtily. `Yes, sit down, and I'll tell you how that I have heard your conversation with Archibald as you crossed the bridge last night reported to me. I am not the man to have my daughter made the subject of loud words in the public thorough-fares. I have, therefore, sent for you two young gentlemen, to have a little talk with you.' Nelson looked both mortified and angry at this firm and spirited declaration of the captain's, and sullenly taking a chair, he looked sumultaneously from him to Archibald, as if he believed the latter had been the reporter. He understood the look, and said quietly. `It was not through me that Captain Talbot heard of the words which passed between us.' `No, sir,' responded the captain; `I heard it from the toll-gatherer, who over-heard you as you passed; for it seems you let you feelings so far overcome your discretion in discoursing about my daughter that you forgot there were ears abroad.' `I am very sorry, sir, that—' `No matter now, it is passed; but I have resolved there shall be no more of it. I have therefore sent for you both, that we might have an understanding together. No doubt you both feel an interest in Blunche; it is natural you should, under the circumstances, and then she is such a good girl, no one can see her and not love her. Therefore, I do n't blame you, my lads. But she must not be made the subject of contention between you. She must not be the means of making enemies of two friends.' `I have no hostility towards Mr. Worthington,' answered Osborne, doggedly. `I do not fear his rivalship.' `That is not the question. You both visit my daughter. What Mr. Worthington's intentions are, he has told me!' `And mine you shall also know. I love Blanche Talbot, if I ever loved anybody, and if I could get your consent and her's, sir, I should think I was more than repaid for having saved her life.' Archibald smiled. The captain looked at Nelson as if he was doubtful whether he had heard him aright; but seeing the smile on Worthington's face, he was satisfied that he had. `Then you think your service requires pay, young man. If you only want to be rewarded and expect Blanche only as a reward for having saved her, why I think I had better keep her, and give you what you ask in money.' `I did not mean, sir, that is—I—' `No matter. No man can eat his own words again. What you have said you have said.' `It was an unlucky slip of the tongue, sir. I love Blanche for herself,' answered Nelson, who saw that he had inadvertently betrayed the hollowness and selfishness of his true character. He saw that the captain and Worthington both felt contempt for him. This conviction did not have a tendency to increase his amiability. But feeling that it would be dangerous to his hopes in reference to Blanche to show anger, he restrained his spirit, and smiling, added, `I do not wish any reward for what I did, save the happiness of knowing that I saved her.' `That's a better speech and sentiment,' said the captain. `But, gentlemen, this interview must be brief. You both claim my daughter's hand, both seem to have equal claims, and I do not know that one has greater than the other; this will be for Blanche to decide whenever she is called upon to do so; for she is supposed to be able to know her own mind with reference to you, best. Now, you are both young, and neither of you are able to support a wife as Blanche ought to be supported; for she shall not go from my house to endure privations. Blanche, also, is young. If you were, either of you, this day, to receive my consent and her own, to woo her, I should not let her be married for three years at the farthest. She would then be twenty, a good and proper age for a maiden to wed.' `I should not wish to marry her soner, sir, so I only get her consent,' said Nelson, with readiness. `And you, Master Worthington; what say you?' `If I should be so happy as to be preferred by the lovely Blanche, sir, I should cheerfully acquiesce in whatever delay she imposed upon me.' `Very well, now hear what I have to propose. `The country has just declared war against England. Soldiers for the army, and seamen for the navy are called upon to repair to the rendezvous to serve their country. Neither of you have any profession which will bind you down here. If you both choose to go and distinguish yourselves during this war, whether in the army or navy, as you may choose for yourselves, at the end of the war I will give Blanche to the one that has earned for himself the most honorable name. There can be no objection to this condition, sir,' answered Archibald. `You have only anticipated my own intentions, Captain Talbot; for I have already made up my mind to go into the navy and join the Eagle frigate, now fitting out at Boston. But I had hoped first to have the promise of Blaneche's hand; but I am willing to comply with the condition you propose; that he who acquits himself the most bravely shall win her.' `The war may last for seven years,' said Osborne, who did not look as if he relished the proposed ordeal. `Well, I will limit the time for your absence. If you, either of you, return at the end of three years, bringing back a name that men will speak with praise on account of your exploits, Blanche shall be yours; for I know she will not refuse her hand to a brave man, who, for her sake, has perilled his life in his country's battles. Now, young gentlemen, you know the conditions. Fulfil your part, and I will fulfil mine.' `I am glad of this opportunity, sir, of testing my devotion to Blanche,' answered Archibald, with manly sincerity in the tone of his voice. `I think the terms rather hard, Captain,' said Nelson, trying to laugh, and to appear as if he spoke in a joking way: for a bullet might put an end to all our distinction.' `He who would win a fair lady must not fear bullets, young man. I should have heeded them little in my young days, if such an offer as I make you was proposed to me.' `Captain Talbot, I shall go to-morrow to Boston, in a packet that sails there,' said Richard, `I shall not return, neither shall I write home until you have heard to me through the gazettes of my native country. If I cannot in three years do something worthy of Blanche I do not deserve her.' The two young aspirants for the maiden's hand then shook hands with the Captain and took their leave. Nelson tried to go with a good grace, but he evidently felt deeply chagrined and vexed. He looked round, and lingered as if he would see Blanche; but she did not make her appearance. Archibald, on the contrary, shook the Captain heartily by the hand, and, although he did not see Blanche, he felt more gratified than otherwise; for he said in his heart, I will see her this evening and say good bye to her alone. `Now, my friends,' said the Captain, as he accompanied them to the door, `I hope you will both be good friends and honorable rivals. You will have a fair start together for distinction, and I trust that you will yet return full of honors; and to him who has proved himself most deserving Blanche shall be given.' Nelson Osborne walked rapidly away from the house, not caring to have Archibald for his companion across the bridge. The latter merely smiled at his hostile feelings, and proceeded leisurely on his own way. The reader is already aware, from Blanche's confession, that she granted to each a brief interview the same evening. The next day Archibald left his native valley, resolved never to return to it until he should return worthy of Blanche. Nelson Osborne remained two or three days in town and then suddenly departed. Some said he had gone to Portland to enlist in the troops destined for the defence of that place; others said he had enlisted in the marine corps, of which there was a rendezvous at Wiscassett.— The latter persons were correct. He went to Wiscassett, and enlisted in a company that soon afterwards proceeded to New York, for the purpose of garrisoning the fort at Governor's Island. From that time there was no trace of him reached Captein Talbot during the war, nor was anything heard of Archibald, save that he joined the frigate Eagle and sailed in her from Boston. A rumor had indeed reached the valley of the Kennebec that a certain person, by the name of Osborne, had been disgraced from the service for some misdemeanour; but no one could tell whether it was Nelson Osborne or not. But from Archibald Worthington no intelligence of any kind was received save secretly by Blanche. But how this was will by and by appear. We will now briefly follow the career of Nelson Osborne. The company of marines to which he was attached had been ordered to a sloop-of-war, which, after various cruises, reached Rio. While on board of her, doing duty as sentry, Nelson one day recognised Archibald coming on board. His surprise at seeing him on equal terms with the officers was only surpassed by his envy and vexation. He saw that he was already in advance of him. He secretly resolved, therefore, like a coward as he was, that he would endeavor to compass his destruction. What he heard of the bravery of the young man only confirmed him in his hatred of him. He had asked one of the officers what that person had done to entitle him to their companionship, and was answered, `He was the first man that boarded the British frigate Monmouth and hauled down her colors. He is the bravest young fellow in the navy, and will have a midshipman's warrant ere long.' `Not if I can prevent it,' muttered the marine; `I see that I must hope to win Blanche, not by distinguishing myself. but by preventing Worthington from doing so. If I have to take his life, I will stop his career. Blanche Talbot is already his.' It was a year before Nelson Osborne had an opportunity of putting his design into execution. At length he succeeded in being transferred to the same ship to which Archibald was attached. He pretended the closest friendship for him, and succeeded in deceiving him and winning his confidence, assuring him that having long since given up all thoughts of Blanche, he had now no reason to look upon him as an enemy. Seeing that Archibald believed him, he watched his opportunity for compassing his death; for on this he had resolved. His watchful spirit was ever on the alert for an opportunity which should both ensure his rival's destruction and his own safety. At length one offered, just such a one as he would have chosen. The sloop-of-war had stopped at an uninhabited island for water, aud in one of the boats which went on shore was a small detachment of marines. Nelson managed to get into this party, as Archibald was to have command of the boat; and, said he to htmself, `now is the time (if ever) for me to seek his ruin. On the shore we shall be scattered, and I shall have an opportunity of putting him out of the way without suspicion.' At sunset, when the boats were ready to put off, Archibald nor his faithful companion Cæser were to be found.— After a brief search, the boats pulled on board, as it was growing dark, and the officers resolved to search for them in the morning, supposing they had wandered unwittingly into the interior. But the search proved fruitless, and the sloop sailed, leaving them to their fate. CHAPTER XI. THE RETURN. The joy of Nelson Osborne at hearing the order, at length given by the sorrowing commander of the sloop-of-war, to weigh anchor and continue on the voyage, was very great. He felt that now his triumph was complete; that Blanche Talbot was to be his own. He laughed secretly as he heard the officers and men lament the loss of the noble young man, and speak of him in terms of the warmest praise. He felt that he had no more to fear from so formidable a rival, who had already, ere half the term of their probation had expired, had acchieved honors sufficient to win him the hand of Blanche Talbot. `No one will ever know or suspect the part I have had in this matter,' he said, within himself; `and as he will never live to return to claim her, of course Blanche is bound to be mine.' Osborne had now only one draw back to his satisfaction; and this was the time that would elapse, a year and a half, before he should dare to present himself before the old captain and ask the hand of his daughter. Till that time should arrive he felt indifferent as to the performance of his duty; `for,' thought he, `in the death of Worthington every thing is acchieved at my hands.' The sloop sailed round the Horn and was absent for nearly a year longer, a year most irksome to Nelson Osborne. At length it returned to New York bringing him home in irons for having, by force of arms, resisted his superior officer. He was sentenced to receive thirty nine lashes the day of the sloop's arrival in port, and to be infamously turned ashore in citizen's garb. For some weeks he wondered about the city, the hanger on of the docks and taverns, and finally stealing from a land-lord, he was arrested and imprisoned for four months. When he was discharged the war was drawing to a close and he resolved that he would prepare to present himself in his native town, and also prepare a story of his deeds in the war, that should carry credit with it to the old captain. He reached Boston by working his passage on a coasting vessel and there, with the proceeds of a gold watch he had stolen from the captain of the trader, he purchased a suit of infantry uniform of a lieutenant's grade, having been so fortunate, as he conceived it to be, to see a lieutenant Osborn reported for his gallantry at the late battle of New Orleans. `It is my own name without the (e) and I will use it, for the owner will never call for it, at least till I have got Blanche on the strength of it. And it is very common for a letter to be left out in a person's name in the hurry of printing. Fortunately they hav'nt given his other name, or it might not chime with mine. Lieutenant Osborn I will be!' Thus resolved, he purchased, as we have said, a lieutenant's uniform and sword, and having carefully collected the two or three different notices of the battle at New Orleans, in each of which in a different manner, but always in terms of high praise, this Lieutenant Osborn was spoken off, he went to the Exchange Hotel and so entered his name upon the register: viz— `Lieutenant Osborne, New Orleans!' The news of the battle having but a few days previous reached the city, the gentlemen in the hotel seeing an officer enter his name in this manner of course supposed it to be the same one alluded to in the papers. One or two gentlemen, wishing to do him honor and to learn the details of the fight, approached and, in-introducing themselves, asked if it was not Lieutenant Osborn who had distinguished himself in the late battle at New Orleans, they had the honor of addressing?' `I cannot lay claim, gentlemen, to any distinction,' he answered, bowing and smiling. `I had the honor to be present in the gallant affair.' The next day appeared the following notice in the Centinel: `The gallant Lieutenant Osborn, whose heroic conduct at New Orleans reflected such credit upon America, is now at the Exchange Hotel in this city. We understand from those who have conversed with this gentleman that he come as far as Washington, bearer of Despatches from General Jackson, and has now extended his journey thus far, being on his way to visit his friends at the eastward.' This flattering announcement was not unlooked for or unexpected by Osborne. He had said to himself, `If I go to the Exchange and put up for a day or two, I shall get my name in the papers, and that will do my business with the captain.' Three days after this notice appeared, and armed with it in his pocket, he reached his native town, so timing his entrance as to arrive at dusk; as he did not wish to attract any particular attention until he had settled matters to his satisfaction over at the `Barracks.' `When I get the consent of the old captain, and set the day for the wedding then I shall have no fears! Besides what should I fear! Worthington is dead! And it can be proved that I am the same lieutenant Osborn that put up at the Exchange, and who is noticed so favorably in the paper. What more can the captain want or ask? Yes,' he asked himself, as he glided across the bridge, `what more can he desire? I will have the marriage take place within three days. Once married, and Blanche and her money mine, I shall not care what discoveries the old man makes, so long as he never discovers the hand I had in Worthington's— What can that person be doing there, skulking about the captain's?' he exclaimed quickly, as he now discovered Cesar with his bag of oranges. `I think I have seen that figure before, but where I can't tell. I will at least see who he is, and get a word or two perhaps as to the way things remain at the captain's, if it should be any body that lives with him. It is a negro I will see who and what he is. By heaven! If the dead could rise—but it can't be he!' He then shouted to Cesar, in the manner we have already described, and approached him. Having now brought the history of this personage up to this point, and also farther, to where he makes his appearance at the door of the captain, after Cesar's departure, we will now resume the thread of the narrative. The rap which he had given on the door, and which aunt Sarah rose to reply to, was given with a sort of recklessness. Like one who felt that there could be no question of his pretensions or claims made by the parties, before whom he was about to present himself. As Aunt Sarah rose to go out to the door, and before he was ushered in, as we have stated, the captain was startled by an exclamation from Blanche, who, while listening for what was said at the door, her eyes being on the Centinel, but without reading it, she chanced to see the name of `Osborn.' She raised the paper to read the paragraph, which was the same that has been already copied above. It flushed her cheek with alarm and misgiving, and exclaiming— `Can it be possible that it is he. But it can't be!' `What child? who? Wait till the person comes in.' `I mean this in the paper father,' and she read it rapidly aloud. `That is odd! And lives down east here! It may be Nelson—there is no telling. But—hist—' The door was just then thrown open, and Aunt Sarah came in, as already described in a former chapter, followed by Nelson Osborne. Blanche instantly recognised him and uttered a suppressed cry of surprise, while the Captain said heartily— `Ah, Mr. Osborne, I am glad to see you. You are well returned from the wars. Welcome home, sir.' `And so it is, Mister Osborne,' exclaimed Aunt Sarah, with recognition.— `How tall he is grown, and how fierce his whiskers look. Who'd have known him. Take a chair, sir.' `I am glad to see you all well again!' said Osborne, bowing and seating himself, and feeling vexed at Blanche, who had instantly disappeared from the room, without even shaking hands with him.— But the noble girl, who loved Archy with all her soul, was resolved she would give no countenance to his rival: for she saw that he wore the uniform of an officer, and trembled lest it was indeed he who had been alluded to in the Gazette. `Were he returned a General I should not love him, nor would I marry him,' she said, after she had been walking her room some eight or ten minutes, greatly disturbed at the return of one she hoped she should never see again. `Blanche, your father says you must come in,' said her aunt, going to her room for her. `Why does he wish it. I cannot treat this Nelson Osborne civilly.' `He has returned a lieutenant.' `So much the worse for me.' `He is spoken of in the papers as a hero and great soldier. You don't know what he hasn't done.' `He is in a very great hurry to trumpet his own praises.' `Brother asked him. Or, rather said to him, we feared we should not see you again, sir, as you have been so quiet.' `Perhaps you did not look for Lieut. Osborne, Captain,' he said. `What, are you the officer spoken of in this paper,' asked brother. `It was such a beautiful notice, and—' `I know, aunt, I know. And did he say he was the person?' she asked, pale as death. `Yes, and is now showing your father some other newspapers he brought with him, in which his exploits are printed.— You ought to go down at once.' `Well, I will go just to see this great hero, who so modestly talks of himself,' she answered, with a sarcastic smile. `Yes, come dear. He will be sure to be your husband, for it is impossible Archibald Worthington can ever have done any thing to compare with this Lieutenant Osborne.' `You may marry him, aunt, but I never shall were he a general.' `Ah, Blanche, no running away, girl,' said her father, as he saw her re-enter. `I have good news for you from one of your two friends. Here is young Osborne, who has been keeping very sly all the while only to surprise us in the end. This is Lieut. Osborne, of the army, the very hero we have just been reading about in the Centinel. Do you hear that, Blanche. By my faith I am taken all aback; for I didn't expect nothing like it. `Why don't you welcome him, girl.' `Lieutenant Osborne is very welcome, sir,' said Blanche, in a very peculiar tone; one that puzzled the `Lieutenant' to analyse, but one that did not please him. He half suspected she knew the truth about him—but then this seemed impossible. `She doesn't like me, that is certain. The raising from the dead of Archibald Worthington, however it was done, has given her hopes of him. But I will defeat him. Dead or alive, Blanche Talbot shall never be his. It is the strangest thing in the world his turning up with that negro of his, whom I supposed dead long ago. `If he has been alive where has he been? I have not heard from him nor of him. If he has done any thing more I should have known it. But let him go! I shall secure my interest here in this fair girl before he sees her!' `I am very welcome, am I, Miss Blanche,' he added; `your looks seem to speak a different language from your lips. I am surprised at this coldness. I have returned and shown your father proofs of my good conduct and promotion in the war. I come to you, as it were, fresh from the field of glory, and lay my laurels at your feet.' `If looks do not please you sir, I cannot help it,' said Blanche dryly. `What has got into the girl,' exclaimed her father. `This wont do, Blanche! If Lieutenant Osborne has shown himself worthy of you, I am bound to give you to him, if he still desires your hand.' `I still do, sir. The beauty of your sweet daughter has been my watchword in the war. I will not resign her to any! The three years are up.' `Hear that, Blanche?' `Yes, father. But the three years do not expire till to-morrow.' `And what of that, Blanche?' `To-morrow may turn the scales in favor of one who may be able to present claims superior far to those which this gentleman advances.' `Do you mean Archibald Worthington?' said Aunt Sarah. `If you do, Lieutenant Osborne has nothing to fear srom him; for so far as we can learn, he has returned only a sailor. His name has never got into any of the papers. Indeed, Blanche, you must give him up.' `Not till he appears and fails to show that he is without merit,' answered Blanche with a quiet smile. Archibald Worthington I know nothing of,' answered Osborne in an indifferent tone; he did behave very well I believe, in some engagement early in the war, but afterwards was put on shore for some act of insubordination, and since then I never have heard of him.' `The story is false!' cried Blanche, with a flashing eye. `Do you give me the lie, Miss Talbot?' `Yes, if you state such an open falsehood! I know it to be an untruth, a base fabrication! `I heard so, Miss, I only heard so.' `And how do you knaw it to be false, neice?' asked her aunt with surprise. `It is no matter now. To-morrow he will himself in person answer all questions, and honorably defend himself from all charges that envy or hatred may invent to do him injury!' `Really Blanche, you are quite spirited in his defence; almost too much so,' said the captain. `Perhaps she thinks it necessary to take the part of one who will be certain never to appear to take his own,” said Osborne sarcastically. `Be assured Captain Talbot you will never see him. He dare not show his face here, knowing that one is here who can confront him!' `And who is that one?' demanded Blanche indignantly. `Hist! I will have no sparring here. I will wait till to-morrow and see what this young sailor says of himself; for he has sent me a present of a bag of oranges, and word that I shall see him.' `Very well, he may have the presumption to come. But I think sir, that my claim to your daughter's hand is too well established to apprehend that you will listen to him. He may seek to gain favor with you by decrying and injuring me, but—' `He is too noble for such baseness; and besides, his own high character is sufficient basis for the favor he will seek here,' answered Blache. `The words and manner of Nelson Osborne inspired Blanche with the most intense dislike of him that almost amounted to loathing. She knew nothing of his character further than in one of Archibald's letters to her, he had written and then scratched out a few lines in reference to him, by which, for she strove to make out what he had erased as every lady would, she learned that they had met somewhere, and that Nelson had done him an injury. This was all she knew, but it was enough to prejudice her against him. She now turned away from Osborne with an air of supreme contempt, and said to her father, `If you do not wish me any longer, I will retire.' `Well, go,' he answered kindly. `But you must be up bright and early to have your breakfast and go fishing.' `I will be first at your door, sir, to call you,' she answered, smiling; and then kissing him and bidding him good night, and her aunt also, she left the room without deigning to cast a glance at Osborne. `I do not seem to be in very high favor with Miss Blanche,' said he, trying to turn off his chagrin with a laugh. `It is nothing but maidenly coyness,' answered her father. `She will feel better to-morrow towards you. You have quite taken her and all of us by surprise. I hope you will join our party to-morrow. We are going down the river to pass the day pick-nicking and fishing, and return home with the afternoon tide.' `I should be most happy, sir,' answered Nelson, rising and bowing; `but I trust, sir, you will use your influence with Blanche to make her treat me more civilly. Indeed, sir, I feel that I ought to claim her at once as my wife.' `Well, Blanche shall be talked to, Lieutenant,' answered the Captain. `She has somehow great hopes of Archy, though I must confess, in my opinion, you have won her, and I see no reason why you should not have her. But as she kissed me good night, she whisperpered and said that if I would give no decision till to-morrow, and then, if Archibald Worthington did not present higher claims to her hand than you have done, she will consent to become your wife. That is certainly very fair.' `Yes, Captain. To-morrow, then, I hope to receive her; for I am assured that this Worthington is no better than a common sailor. I will not fail to meet you to go in the boat early in the morning.' With these words Nelson Osborne took his leave, shaking hands both with the Captain and Aunt Sarah. When he got out of doors he gnashed his teeth with rage, for he felt that he was hated and that Worthington was loved by the beautiful Blanche, and that, after all his crimes and deceptions, she could never be his. He trembled also lest the return of Worthington should be his ruin; but nevertheless resolved to face him. CHAPTER XII. THE TWO HORSEMEN. `If Archibald Worthington has returned to this country,' mused Nelson Osborne, as he slowly walked across the bridge, he must be at his mother's. All my hopes of Blanche, and my safety, too, depend upon his non-appearance to-morrow. I will not sleep to-night till I have ascertained whether he be really at home, as his negro's presence here, so near his home, leads me to believe. If I find him there, he shall never see Blanche Talbot again. If he has as many lives as a cat, I will have them before I will see him married to her. I can return before day, and in full time to join the Captain's party on the water.' With this resolution he turned aside, after crossing the bridge, which after nine o'clock was free of toll to all foot-passengers, and so he passed unnoticed, and walked rapidly down the river-road in the direction of Hallowell. Archibald Worthington was pacing, with a true sailor's restlessness, up and down the little gravel walk in front of his mother's cottage, enjoying the moonlight and watching the river for Cæsar's return, who had then been gone full time enough to get back. He was a fine-looking young man, tall and manly, with a frank, bold bearing, and the open, pleasing countenance of a person of a generous spirit. He was attired in the undress uniform of an officer in the United States navy, and carried in his hand as he walked, for the night was warm, his blue cap with its gold band. The house before which he was walking faced the water, and was situated a little back from the river-road, with a small yard before it, enclosed by a low paling. The dwelling was of an extremely humble character, being but one story high, and white-washed. A few flowers grew in the yard, and a vine of the scarlet bean was trained to run up one of the windows, and falling down over it, nearly hid it from the passer-by in a curtain of leaves Through the leaves now sparkled a light in the room within. Archibald Worthington loeked very happy. He was once more at home: he had found his mother well and everjoyed to see him again. He was near Blanche, too, and he had returned conscious that he had merited her hand by his deeds of valor. `How Cæsar loiters,' he said, after a long and close survey of the river above. `I fear something may have occurred to detain him. Perhaps he brings evil news, and lingers with it lest he should bring it to my ears too soon.' `Archy, my dear son,' said a lady, coming out of the door, `I fear you will take cold in the night air.' `Take cold, my dear mother,' he answered with a smile at the idea of a sailor's taking cold by being out of doors at night; `why, sailors live out of doors on their decks, mother. But if you only wish me to come in to keep you company, I will obey.' `No, not if you prefer being out here. You don't know how happy I am, Archy, to see you once more before I die; and then to see you return an officer. How strange you never wrote to me, and that I never heard of you, Archy dear.' `I will tell you the reason to-morrow or the next day, mother, after I have seen Blanche. How Cæsar stays. Perhaps they refused the gift.' `He would then return the sooner.' `You say that Blanche was not well when you heard from her?' asked the noble young man anxiously and tenderly. `More beautiful than ever.' `I hope, then, she is still so. `What is that moving? It is a boat coming round the point. It must be Cæsar. I will run up the shore and meet him.' `You have dropped your cap, Archy.' `No mother, dear mother,' he answered, hastening down to the shore, and then up the beach in the direction of the approaching boat. He soon saw that it contained but one person, and in a few minutes he recognised the individual to be Cæsar. `Pull in where I am, Cæsar,' he called to him. `How long you have been.' `Bress you, massa Archy, I hab nuff to 'tain dis niggar! But wait till me fasten um boat.' And Cæsar rowed down parallel with the shore to the boat flotilla in front of the house, while Archibald walked on the shore rapidly questioning him. `Did you see Blanche? Did the Captain accept the oranges? Did you tell him who sent them? How did Blanche look? What did she say? Did you give her the note? Did she give you any thing for me?' To all which inquiries Cæsar replied in detail; and having secured his boat, he turned to his master and began to give him a full account of what passed. It was all very satisfactory to the youthful lover; and when Cæsar took from his hat the old piece of sail-cloth, and drew from it the lock of hair, he caught it from him and covered it with kisses. `Dear, noble, generous, kind Blanche,' he exclaimed with deep emotions of joy. `But I haint told you all, massa,' said Cæsar. `No! What else?' `I see dat marine what spose he hab left you and me dead on the island!' `What Osborne—Nelson Osborne?' exclaimed Archibald with amazement. `Yis, massa, jist dat same indiwidual.' `Where? when? It is very strange.' Cæsar then related to him the circumstances of his meeting and recontr with him; and in proof of his words he took from the boat the sword he had captured. `What can be his motive in being here? How dare he when he is a murderer in intention, and knows he is in my power?' `He spose you dead, you see, massa Archy!' `True! I see through it now! I wonder if he has dared to go to the Captains?' `He won't be well received if he do, massa, coz I tell massa Cap'n's sailor man; Jack, he tell me his name be, all 'bout dis massa Osborne, and he said he'd see how he come to his massa's!' `I do not fear for my own position and hopes in reference to Blanche, but I do not wish them to be imposed upon by one so utterly lost to virtue, honor, and every noble trait of character as Nelson Osborne has proved himself to be.' This was said not to Cæsar, but spoke rather to himself. He remained a few moments silently reflecting upon the intelligence which had been communicated to him by Cæsar. He was confounded at the assurance of Osborne in appearing again in his native place, and evidently with the view of seeking the hand of Blanche. But when he reflected that he supposed the only person he had to fear was no longer living, he was less surprised. To prevent him from imposing upon Captain Talbot, he resolved to go up early in the morning. `Do you think the sailor told the Captain what you narrated to him, Cæsar, and so put him on his guard?' `I sure ob dat, massa; coz he went strait up to de house when I left him to git into de skiff!' `In that case they are safe: otherwise I would go to night and warn them, or send you!' `I tink massa you send and hab him 'rested for murderin' us.' `We are not yet killed, Cæsar, Heaven be thanked. His intentions have been signally defeated. I don't know that I could on my own word without witnesses convict him of his wicked purpose.' `Dare is me, too, massa! I take my oath on him!' `We had best wait and see first what to-morrow brings forth. I do not, if I can help it, care to mix myself up with any such troublesome affair, unless it be found absolutely necessary for the protection of society. I wish to have as little to do with him as possible!' `You best keep on your watch agea him, massa Archy. He sure do you some mischief.' `Sir,' said one of two men who rode up on horseback at that moment, for Archibald was just crossing the road from the water-side and entering the gate to his mother's house, `will you tell me how far it is to Augusta?' `Two miles, sir,' answered Worthington looking steadily at the men, whom he saw were strangers, though he could not discern then features very distinctly, as a cloud was passing over the moon at the time. `Thank you, sir, answered the man, in a bluff, strong voice like one who was in the habit of talking freely and fearlessly with all men. `Do you know sir, if there is a Lieutenant Osborne recently arrived at Augusta; for as you live so near, you must doubtless be familiar with all the news stirring there!' `Lieutenant Osborne!' repeated Archibald, `I do not know any such person, sir!' `Perhaps he may have dropped his title this way, having no further use of it,' responded the man. `Is there a Nelson Osborne in Augusta?' `Yes sir, I have just heard that there is,' responded Worthington with surprise. `Could you direct me the best way to find him, after entering the village?' `Probably at his mother's, sir! But you just inquired for Lieutenant Osborn. Are they one and the same! The one I know cannot be an officer, for he is a villain!' `Oh, you seem to know whom we want! They are not the same!' answered the other person who had not hitherto spoken. `You appear to be an officer, sir! May I ask whom I have the honor of addressing. `I am a lieutenant in the navy, sir! My name is—is—Worthington sir!' `Then I will speak freely to you, Lieutenant Worthington. I am lieutenant Osborn. Last week on my arrival in Boston I found that some person had preceded me and assumed my name, and representing my person, and lodged at the hotel and received the courtesies of several of the principal citizens. I should not have complained of this greeting, if he had been any thing like an honest rogue; but it seems that after he had left the city, on the very morning of my arrival, it was discovered that he had stolen a valuable diamond from one of the hotel rooms and sold it to a jeweller in whose possession it was found. `Yes, I myself, found it,' said the other.' I am an officer of the police!' `Judge my surprise, sir, when I found what had occurred, and that my name had been made infamous! After satisfying those interested that I was the true Lieutenant Osborne, I resolved to follow up the imposter; and as the police also determined to seek him out to arrest him, I started with them from Boston; and we have succeeded in tracing the gentleman thus far!' `I found out before I left Boston,' said the officer, `that the person who represented Lieutenant Osborne was a certain Nelson Osborne who came from New York in a coasting packet, from which he stole a watch belonging to the skipper, and for which theft I have a warrant for him, if I catch him! while in the packet he said he was from Kennebec! This information was of great value to me in getting on the scent!' `I am truly sorry, Lieutenant Osborne,' said Archibald, `for the unfortunate position you have been placed in by this person who has abused your name. This is not his first villany. But it is not for me to revile him. I hope you will succeed in arresting him. He was seen not an hour since on the other side of the river near the black-house. He wore, says my man here, who saw him, an infantry undress uniform. His mother lives three houses above the bridge on the left. He may he found there! If you arrest him please let me know when you return!' `If I take him, I shall lodge him in jail at Augusta till to-morrow, for we both of us need rest,' answered the police officer. `I am greatly indebted to you Lieutenant Worthington,' said the officer; `we were fortunate in having spoken with you. Good night sir!' `Good night, gentlemen.' The two horsemen now rode rapidly forward. Archibald followed them with his eyes until they were out of sight and then turning to Cesar said, `Well Cesar what do you think of all this?' `It very 'markable, massa Archy! I I berry good of it. I hopes he get what he desarves now sure!' `It is very strange! What a thorough villain Nelson has turned out to be. Poor fellow! I am sorry for him, for I cannot forget our school-boy-days. But even then I saw the seeds of the fruit he has brought forth. If he had truly loved Blanche Talbot, he could never have become the man of the evil heart and evil hand he is! But he is about to have his recompense! What a career his has been!' `He no be able to fight himself to be an ossifer, massa Archy, and so he steat anodder ossifer's name! I should'nt wonder if he go and see Missy Blanche wid dis lie in him mouth!' `You have hit it! This must have been all his mistake, Cesar. But we shall know all to-morrow. Poor Osborne, I pity him; but as he has sown so he must reap.' Nelson Osborne, whom we left pursuing his way from the bridge along the river road, in the direction of the house of Archabald's mother, where he hoped to find his rival, had got about half way between the two villages when he beheld two horsemen riding rapidly along the road approaching. He had been so deeply engaged in contemplating some plan of surprising and murdering Worthington if he should be at home, that the horsemen were very near before he discovered them. Always suspicious, like all guilty men, he would have turned out of his way to avoid them, for he did not wish to be seen by any one on the errand he was engaged in, but at this part of the road there were deep ditches and high fences, so that it was not easy to avoid them. He, therefore, resolved to pass on his way boldly, bending his body forward upon a huge cudgel he carried, as it he was an old man, and slouching his cap over his eyes. The two horsemen came up, and drawing rein, looked at him closely. The officer kept on without quite stopping his horse, but the police-officer, (for they were the two persons who ten minutes before had left Archibald Worthington at his mother's gate) checking his horse, said, `Hulloh, old man: whither away so late, hey?' `Home, gentlemen,' muttered Osborne, who did not at all like the salutation, or the manner of it. `Let me see your face. I am a Boston police-offier, and I never let any face pass me when I am on a hunt without seeing who it belongs to. Old or young, it makes no difference: man or woman: for rogues hide themselves under all disguises. Come, look up!' `I am very decrepid,' answered Osbore his voice trembling and unsteady, but with fear rather than age, for he began to suspect he might be after himself, and he covered his face and stooped lower, and hurried on. `Then I will get down and see you, lieutenant. Ride back. We may or may not have bagged something here; but it is best to be safe.' As the officer spoke he leaped from his horse, and advanced upon him, with his hand on a pistol; for there was something in him that awakened his suspicions that all was not right; for your keen police officer, `Sees rognes in rock, traitors in trees, And hears a thief's whisper in every breeze.' Osborn in the outset of his expedition had turned his coat to disguise himself the more; but the keen eye of the police-officer soon detected a glitter of the lace in the moonlight. As the officer alighted Osborne straightened himself and ran like a deer. Lieutenant Osborne being mounted pursued, while the police officer regaining his saddle followed at full speed, being sure that he had got his man, or at least some other arrant rogue. Osborne finding he would be over-taken strained every nerve to reach an opening in the fence that he knew led to the river-side, when by diving into the water he hoped to escape. `It is our man, be sure,' said Lieutenant Osborne, `he must not be suffered to escape us.' `Not if I have to bring him with a bullet,' answered the police officer, as he dashed past him, with his pistol in his hand, and at a slapping pace. At this instant Osborne reached the gab and turned towards it; but he had not diverged two yards from the road before the officer, fearing he should lose him, fired his pistol not at him, but over him so as to alarm him. But a sharp cry of pain told him that he had hit the fugitive. Upon coming up they found him on the ground, and bleeding profusely from a wound in the hip, and evidently in great pain. `The ball must have struck this post here and glanced,' said the officer, `for I did not aim at him.' `Both now dismounted, and the policeman staunched the blood, before asking him any questions. `You should have hove to, my man,' he said. `You grew young too quick for an honest man.' `Who are you?' asked the army officer. `Who are you?' demanded Nelson, doggedly. `I am a Boston police-officer,' answered the other. `I am after a certain Nelson Osborn, otherwise Lieutenant Osborn, and I am glad to have the pleasure of meeting him. Don't deny your name my good Sir, for I saw you at the Exchange when I was in Boston, and for that reason was selected to hunt you up.' `Is it he?' exclaimed the army officer, with surprise. `It is, and no mistake. I could swear to him anywhere. This has been a nice night's work for us.' CHAPTER XIII. THE FISHING EACURTION. Nelson Osrorne finding himself recognized by the officer, did not deny his identy, and, indeed, knew well if he did so, it could only be for a brief period, as they had only to take him to Augusta to have it clearly decided who he was. Though suffering from the wound, which was very painful, but not dangerous, he was able to ride after the officer placed him on his horse, by which he walked till they reached Augusta. Here the police officer at once proceeded to the prison, and placed him in custody of the goaler, at the same time sending for a surgeon. It was not until towards morning that Nelson Osborne found himself alone upon his pallet in his cell, the surgeon and the goaler having left him to that repose which he needed, but which his pains and his conscious guilt, with his fears of the future, would not suffer him to enjoy. He had understood from the officer the cause of his arrest, and knew that in the future before him, if he lived, lay years of imprisonment and of toil, and of infamy. The reflection that Blanche was lost to him forever maddened him; and between rage, pain, and fears unutterable, he tossed upon his hord couch in a state of the keenest torture. Early the next morning, the day proving fine, the Captain and his daughter, accompanied by Aunt Sarah went down on board the `wind-Eater,' for the purpose of going on their excursion down the river. Jack had got every thing ready, the sails bent, and the locker supplied, while the companion-way was strewn with lines for all sorts of fish. Upon reaching the boat, the old Captain, finding the wind fair, would have put off at once, but he could see nothing of Osborne whom he expected would have met him at the boat. `I wonder where he is?' he at length exclaimed, with some pettishness, `we must go without him.' `Who, father?' asked Blanche, for he had not told her he had invited the young man to be of the party. `Nelson Osborne, or rather Lieutenant Nelson Osborne. He should be here.' `I am, for one, glad he is not,' she answered very firmly. `He is a great scamp, your honour,' said Jack, `if he is the one I mean. I heard all about him last night, and went up to the house, you see, to tell you about him, coz he was cruising about the place. But findin' the dead-lights all in, and every body gone to bed, I put it off till this morning. He is a great rogue, your honor.' `How do you know that?' demanded the Captain, with surprise. `I got it from his nigger.' `The negro had his reasons for abusing him, I dare say,' said Aunt Sarah, who had been very much taken with the young man's uniform and his flattery, to say nothing of his title of Lieutenant. `No doubt he had, no doubt,' answered the Captain,' and if this is all you know, Jack, you had best belay your queer talking. The young gentleman is a man of honour, at least I shall think so, until it is proved to the contrary. Come, cast off, and let us make sail, if he is not coming. I dare say he has over-slept himself, or fallen in with some of his old friends.' The wind-eater was now unloosed from her fastenings at the little pier, and Jack aided by a lad whom he used to employ as his `crew,' hoisted jib and fore-sail and ran out from the shore. The main-sail then followed, and the fine little bark went merrily down the river before a pleasant north wind. The boat with its occupants was distinctly seen by Nelson Osborne from the window of his cell, which overlooked the river, and towards which he crawled with difficulty on account of his wound, remembering his engagement, and wishing to see if they embarked. `There they go as happy and forgetful of me as if I had never lived!' he muttered bitterly. `They will soon, if they have not already, hear what has become of me. If my glances were curses how I would like to annihilate them.— This, then, is the end of all my hopes. It would have been better, I see, for me to have been honest and virtuous, than to have tried by crime and fraud to have win her. In pursuing the course I have, I find I have only been playing into Worthington's hands; for even if he has not distinguished himself, he certainly has not made a villain of himself as I have; and so the hand of Blanche will be his, while mine clanks with chains.' The Wind-Eater sailed down as far as the Half-way Rock, and there by the captain's order, came to, and anchored, the main-sail being lowered and the fore-sail trailed up, while the jib was left hoisted to keep her stationary. Blanche was too muce excited with the prospect of seeing Archibald to give her full attention to catching fish. She lost no less than three hooks within the first ten minutes; for her eyes were on the green banks instead of the line, and she was thinking more of discerning Archy rowing up the river road than in capturing fish. `Blanche, girl, you will be more likely to catch birds than fish, for you look more at the woods than the water,' said the captain. `I never knew Miss Blanche to have sich bad luck in hooks afore,' said Jack. `There's Miss Sarah had caught a red perch, and is as proud of it as if it was a baby.' `A what?—Why Jack!' exclaimed the blushing spinster. `Really, if you are so indelicate, I shall have to be set on shore.' `Capital Jack. But she wants to be set on shore, I see, because there's two fine young fellows coming down that bank as if they'd break their necks.' `What bank?' cried Blanche; and looking in a direction above the path, on which her eyes had hitherto been fixed, she beheld two officers descending the bank, followed by Cesar. At a glance she recognised in the leading one, Archibald Worthington though he had altered so much for the better, that her heart bounded with joyful admiration. The other officer was a stranger. `I am sure I did not see them before,' said aunt Sarah, `I wonder who they can be.' `One is a naval officer and the other an army officer! That is clear!' said the Captain, who had dropped his line to observe them. `And I guess I know that navy officer, your honor,' said Jack. `He looks amazingly like Master Worthington!' `So he does! It must be! But how the deuce comes he to be in uniform? Yet it must be he, Sarah, for look at Blanche's face! She knows him, at least! I will at any rate hail 'em and ask 'em aboard!' `Not for the world, brother! Dear me!' cried the spinster, looking as if quite shocked at the idea of having two gentlemen on board. `Besides, it isn't young Worthington. He can't be an officer, that's certain!' The boat was anchored about twelve fathom from the Half-way Rock out in the stream, and the two officers, who were Worthington and Lieutenant Osborn, were already upon the rock, both raising their caps to the party. `Come aboard, gentlemen, come aboard!' said the Captain; `Jack, put off after them in the yawl!' Jack cast off a small green boat that towed astern, and, springing into it, sculled ashore. The officers, followed by Cæsar, entered it, and in a few moments were alongside the shallop. `You are welcome, gentlemen!' said the Captain, who was now satisfied that one of them was indeed Worthington, though he wondered and stared at his uniform. `I am glad to see you back again, Master Worthington!' As he spoke he shook hands with Archibald as he stepped on deck; and then offered his hand to Lieutenant Osborne, though Archibald, in his anxiety to speak to Blanche, neglected to introduce. `God bless you, dearest Blanche!' he said, as he grasped both of the hands of the happy girl, and holding them for a moment in his while he gazed into her face with all his heart in his eyes. `God be thanked that I can see and speak with you once more!' Blanche did not speak. Her joy was too great for utterance. But she eloquently looked her happiness. `And you, too, Miss Talbot,' said Archibald, extending his hand to Aunt Sarah, `how well you look. Time has not troubled himself to make any change in you, since I last saw you!' `And you are looking so finely and so handsome. Who would have thought it?' said Aunt Sarah, quite flattered at his words of commendation, and disposed at once to feel kindly towards him. But she wondered, as well as her brother, at his uniform. Blanche could not keep her fond eyes from him, and thought how handsome and noble-looking he had grown, and how his beautiful uniform became him. These were very happy moments for the faithful, loving girl. `I beg vour pardon, Captain Talbot,' said Archibald; `but I should have introduced my friend. `This is Lieutenant Osborne, of the army. Doubtless you have heard his name as one of the officers who so highly distinguished themselves in the battle of New Orleans.' At this an exclamation of surprise escaped all three, Blanche as well as the father and aunt. `Why, what does this mean?' cried the Captain. `We have already had one Lientenant Osborne. He was to see me last night, and promised to have been here to-day. Explain this, gentlemen, for, in faith, you mystify me.' `I will explain it, sir; for I see you also have been imposed upon,' said Lieutenant Osborne. `But first, sir, how am I to know you are Lieutenant Osborne?' `Of that I will shortly give you proof; but I will now say that I shall be the guest to-day of Judge C—, who knows me well, and to whom I will refer you.' `That is enough, sir,' answered the Captain. `The person who came to you and represented himself as a lieutenant, is a fugitive from justice. His name is Osborn, and tempted by the similarity of name, he assumed my character and position in Boston, and passed himself off as myself upon the citizens, and even was honorably spoken of in the papers. While there he stole a vnluable diamond and suddenly left the city. I arrived in Boston two days afterwards, and found my name intamous. I took a police officer, and pursued the man who had so deeply injured me, and succeeded last night in capturing him, though not without wounding him in his attempt to escape from the officer. He is now lodged in the gaol in our village, and will tomorrow, if he is able, be removed to Boston for trial; as he has had three warrants issued against him.' `Can this be possible?' exclaimed Captain Talbot, who had listened with amazement. `It is true, sir. If you will return to town you shall have proof of it; for I see that he has imposed upon you, and it is proper you should know what a villain he is.' `I am satisfied, sir: I am now convinced that I have been imposed upon. Sir, you have done me and mine a great service—I was about to take this fellow into my confidence and family.' `No, dear father,' said Blanche; `only if there were no other claimant who could prove a better title to your confidence,' said Blanche with a smile. `I suspected him from the first.' `I never will have any confidence in man again,' cried Aunt Sarah. `Who would have though it! I shall look on every body as imposters after this!' and she cast an ominous glance at Archibald. `It is time for me to speak now and advance my pretensions, I see,' said Archibald. `If you will listen to me, I will endeavor to prove to you all that I have not been forgetful in the war that I had two motives to valor—my country and Blanche!' `But how is it you return a sailor, as Cæsar said you were?' `An ossifer am still a sailor, massa,' answered Cæsar with a broad grin. `And are you indeed an officer?' asked the captain. `I have been so deceived I must be pardoned for doubting.' `I will answer for him, sir,' said Lieutenant Osborne: `This is Lieutenant Worthington, of the United States Navy, —and a more gallant officer is not in the service.' `And yet, Archibald, we have not read your name in the papers.' `For this reason, sir,' answered Archibald, smiling; `and I will relate to you what I have related to my friend this morning; for you must know that he spoke to me last night on his way to Augusta with the police officer, and inquiring about Osborne, informed me of his character and of their intentions. Fearing Nelson might have imposed on you, I could not rest, and at day proceeded to learn of you if he had imposed on you. On the way I passed the gaol and called to know if he had been taken, where I met this gentleman at the door, and we instantly by day-light recognised one another as having both dined with each other ten days before in Washington; for he was there receiving his commission and I mine. The meeting was a gratifying one, and he having informed me of Osborn's arrest, I gave him as we breakfasted together a brief account of my own history, and of my hopes in reference to Blanche! He started to go with me to your house when the toll-keeper, of whom we inquired if you were at home pointed to your boat down the river; and hither we hastened, I to lay my claims before you sir, for Blanch's hand, and Lieutenant Osborne to remove the stigma upon his name brought upon it by Nelson's assumption of it; if by chance he had appeared cefore you in the assumed character, and also to bear testimony that I am the Lieutentant Archer whom he met in Washington!' `Lieutenant Archer,' repeated the Captain. `Lieutenant Archer,' exclaimed Aunt Sarah. Blanche made no exclamation of surprise. She merely smiled and looked very happy. `Yes, Captain Talbot,' said Lieutenant Osborne. `This is the William Archer of whose promotion you have doubtless heard!' `This is more and more perplexing,' said the Captain looking from one to the other with a bewildered exprassion.— `Gentleman this needs explanation!— There seems to be a changing and assuming of names all round! If you can prove yourself, Archibald Worthington to be honorably this same William Archer I have read of, you have my daughter for you have fairly won her.' `Read, if you please that commission of my rank as Lieutenant in the Navy, sir.' `Read it, Blanche! But no, I won't believe any eyes but my own. You will cheat me!' The Captain then put on his spectacles and opening the parchment, first glanced at the signatures, then the huge tofficial seals, and the imposing aspect of he splendid copper-plate heading. He then read aloud the words of the commission in their usual form; but when he came to the sentence which read to W. Archibald Worthington, late known as William Archer, &amp;c., he looked round with surprise. `Why how is it, boy! Have you had two names? Are you then this William Archer?' cried the Captain, his eyes sparkling with joy.' `Yes sir. My real name is William Archibald though every body has called me only by the middle name since I was a child. I kept the usual name until one day I was upon an island getting water for the ship, when Nelson Osborn, who was a marine in the same ship, and no doubt sought the ship and came on shore for his purpose, led me aside to show me as he said, a large quantity of silver he had found in a cave. Osborne had professed the warmest friendship to me for months before, having professed to think no more of Blanche and no longer to consider me in the light of a rival. I believed him, and when he asked me to go with him, I went without suspicion. I crept into the cave, which was a low narrow orifice under a cliff, when instantly I found myself in darkness, and he called out to me that `I was now safe, for he had let an over-hanging rock previously loosened by him, and propped, drop in front of the mouth; and wishing me a `happy new year,' for it was new year's day, he said he would now return home and fear no rival for Blanche's hand!' `Can this be possible!' exclaimed the captain with horror. `He will be made to confess it,' answered Archibald. `And how did you escape from that horrible place!' cried the captain, while Blanche sat pale and trembling, as if her lover was still in peril. `Cesar saved me! Tell them Cesar!' `I misses massa Archy after few minnit,' said Cesar, `and when somebody say he walk of wid de naime I spects someting, coz I al'ays hab my 'spicions ob dat soger, and tell massa Archy, but he hush me up and say he him berry good friend. So I goes arter em, and I comes in de wood, and den I soon meets de marine runnin toward me alone! I stand afore him and axes him `whar massa Archy!' But stead o' answerin, he make at me wid his baggonet and run me froo de arm, sayin, `I kill you too and you can go and wait on you' master!' But I show fight, break him baggonet and cut him wid my knife, but he beat me ober de head wid de but ob him gun and lef me dead! But he no kill Cesar all ober. By'm by I come to myself! Den I hears sombody holler. I 'cognise master's voice under ground, and dreful hard work I hab to get him out; but I got him at last!' `Yes, wounded as the faithful fellow was,' said Archibaid, he worked for twelve hours to remove the rock and re store me to liberty. But our ship had sailed for it was morning before I was relieved. We remained seven weeks on the island, living on roots and turtles, and finally were taken off by a French brig which landed us at Porto Rio where I found a merchant vessel that took me to Norfolk. Here I shipped again, but under the name of William Auber, for I supposed Archibald Worthington was dead, and I said to myself, I will earn a distinguished name as William Archer, and when Blanche and the Captain hear of my deeds they will little suspect who it is that they commend! On my arrival at Washington I told my story to the Secretary who had my commission made out to me as you see!' `This is wonderful. But you have written to Blanche, eh?' `Yes; for I was so fortunate after being four months at sea to do some service for which the captain recommended me for promotion; and then I wrote Blanche, telling her my history thus far.' `Then she has known all along that William Archer was yourself. Oh, you baggage.' `Who would have thought!' exclaimed Aunt Sarah. We now close our novelette with but a few words more. Nelson Osborne never left the prison but to be borne to his grave; his wound having inflamed and afterwards mortified. He died confessing the wrongs done to Worthington and asking his forgiveness, exhibiting to all those who came after him the truth that vice always overreaches itself and virtue alone meets with honorable recompense. In a few weeks afterwards Blanche was led to the altar by the happy Archibald, and at the wedding the old captain forgot his gout and danced a minute with aunt Sarah for a partner. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`Dear Blanche—' `Why, how familliar and improper.' `Hist, Sally. Let Blanche go on,' said the captain. `I expected neither more nor less than the `dear.” `I have at last returned to my native shores, and my first duty, as it is my greatest happiness, is first to write you' assuring you of my continued devotion to you. Absence, instead of diminishing, has increased my attachment to you, (here was a `dearest Blanche' which the maiden skipped over!) and although I have seen fair and charming women in the various climes I have visited, not one of them has for a moment made me forget one fairer than all!' `Dear me. What an open flatterer. I really—' `Hist, Sally. Let Blanche finish the letter.' `I am now preparing to leave for the Kennebec. I shall probably take passage in the schooner `Augusta,' that sails the day after to-morrow. I hope to be at my mother's, in Hallowell, by the last of the week; and I shall then write to you. You may expect to see me, or hear from me, by Thursday, which, you will recollect, at least I do, is just the expiration of the three years' probation given us by your father.' `That is to-morrow,' said the captain. `How well the young fellow writes.' `He may have done nothing but write,' remarked aunt Sarah. He seems to have practised pretty well in flattery. I wonder Blanche is n't spoiled. And such kind of letters coming every month to her. Dear me, when I was a young girl if—' `Is the letter ended, Blanche?' asked her father, kindly. `No, sir.' `Then go on.' `I shall not venture,' he says, sir, `to go direct to your house without first sounding my way; for I fear your father, not having heard any good of me, may not be willing to receive me as I could wish. So I will send you word when I get to my mother's. The bearer will be the faithful Cæsar, whom you have so often heard me speak, or rather make mention in my letters. By him send me word how things are at home. I trust your respected aunt still enjoys her health, and that the hand of time has dealt lightly with your father's locks. If you think best, you can let him know that Archibald Worthington is returned; but perhaps you had best keep the secret a little while longer till you hear that I am at home. I have much to say to you when we meet, and particularly about one in whom we have both had some interest. Believe me, dearest Blanche, ever faithfully, your friend and—and—' `And what? Don't skip, Blanche,' said aunt Sarah, eagerly. `Out with it, girl. I see he is a noble fellow if he hasn't done any thing. Don't fear to read out.' `Your friend and love, Archibald Worthington.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">`My dear Blanche—' `Keep silent, sister,' cried the Captain, holding up his finger. No exclamations. One would think you had never heard or seen a love-letter.' `I! If you think so, brother, you are very much mistaken. In my younger days— `Go on, Blanche.' `My dear Blanche, `I know not how to express to you my joy, at being once more so near you.— How have I wished and longed to be where I could once more behold, even only from a distance, the spot where you dwell. I can hardly realize that I am within two miles of you while I write, and that as I look from the window of the room, I can see the oak-crowned hill that towers above the old Block-house and barracks. I am impatient to see you and learn from your father's lips my fate. I shall come up to-morrow without fail. I have only been half an hour arrived home. I find my mother well and overjoyed to embrace me again.— Her humble abode seems to me a dear and blessed shelter, after all the stormy scenes of the last three years. She little suspects my love for you, or the career I have paused through. Occasionally I wrote her home, but told her nothing save of my welfare. A glad surprise awaits her; for I see she looks sorrowful, that I have not brought home a distinguished name; for she loves you, and has set her heart upon your being my wife. Happy word. Happy thought. `I send this by my faithful Cesar. I also send a sack of oranges as a present to your father and aunt. You may tell them, if you choose, that they came from Archibald Worthington, who has returned home from sea. I have ordered Cesar to keep his tongue close, for naturally he is a great gossip; and if he should begin, he would tell all: and what is to be told, I prefer being the narrator of myself. I shall bring with me papers to prove what will be necessary. To-morrow, I shall certainly be with you. Till then, Heaven bless you. Your attached and true, A. W.'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HENRY TEMPLE: OR, A FATHER'S CRIME. BY J. H. INGRAHAM. Entered according to Act of Congress by Williams Brothers, in the Clerk's Office in the District Court of Massachusetts. CHAPTER I. It was Christmas night. The cold wind whistled through the streets, heaping the light, icy snow into drifts and blocking up the passages into the narrow lanes. But few persons save the well-clad watchmen were abroad, though the nine o'clock bell had not yet rung. Here and there only, a passenger, muffled to the eyes, hurried on his way. The street lamps burned dimly, the glasses being nearly coated with a stratum of fine snow, through which the rays came feebly. The windows that faced the streets were closely curtained, and those which had blinds were closed by them as if the inmates would exclude, in the sense of comfort within, the consciousness of the storm that was raging without. Near the corner of a street with a broad, open space at his left, stood a watchman nestled under a door-way. He was a tall, heavily-built man, and his naturally large size was augmented by the huge buffalo skin overcoat and cap which enveloped his form and came down about his ears and eyes. The shelter he had sought did not protect him from the snow, which, whirling and eddying around the corner, fell upon him and covered him with so thick a white coat of it, that he resembled more a huge polar bear standing upon his hind legs, than a human being. His arms were folded upon his chest, and beneath one of them was visible the handle of his weapon of office, a short, heavy staff of white oak, shod with a spear head and hook of polished iron. He had been standing there for some time, like a statue in a niche,—so long, indeed, that the fast falling snow had obliterated upon the pavement the deep track of the last passer-by. The part of the city where he was stationed was the most ancient portion and intersected by numerous narrow and crooked streets and alleys, built up on either side with closely-crowded wooden buildings, mostly with their gable ends to the street, and seldom more than two stories in height. The house in the door nook of which he sought shelter, was one of the oldest in the town. It was built not unlike an ancient block-house, the lower story being many feet less in breadth and length than the second, thus leaving the floor of the second projecting tar over the first, giving room for many persons to stand underneath its piazza-like ceiling. This old building stood on the corner of a street and a square, and its second story projected several feet over the sidewalk on both sides. Above the second story the house towered sharply into three separate gables, on one of which was the date of its construction, 1689. The front was rough stuccoed and painted a dark blue color. The lower story was much sunken into the earth by age, and the support at the angle seemed ready to yield and topple the whole quaint old pile over into the street. But the watchman from his composure and air of security did not seem to feel any such apprehensions. It was a good shelter for him and doubtless had been for his successors for full a century and a half. The prospect from his position was by no means a very interesting one. Old buildings congregated in odd groups were faintly visible by the fitful glare of the street lamps; and to his left, down the square, towering darkly to the skies till its cupola was lost in the gloom of the atmosphere, stood Faneuil hall, solemn and stern. `It's a tough night to stanb watch, or to move abroad either way,' said the watchman, talking to himself by way of beguiling the time and cheering his loneliness. `I hope I shall get through my beat without being disturbed by rogues breaking in. What is that? Oh, only a shutter of this old three-cornered house creaking in the wind. It sounded like the creaking of a man's shoe. Confound these snow-storms! they get up all sorts of sounds, At one moment I hear some chap a whistling. I listen, and it's the wind. Then, by-and-by I hear a whispering as if two thieves were planning together. I creep along to surprise 'em, and it's the wind again, sighing, perhaps, between loose shingles. Then I hear a buzzing of gruff voices, and when I think they are just upon me, I find it has been the wind. Then again I sometimes think I hear a baby crying, and then a distant shriek like a woman hollering murder. So the wind keeps it up and gives a poor devil more trouble than all the rogues in the city put together.' Here an unusually heavy blast tore a loose shutter from a window of the old house, and hurled it with violence and great uproar, to the ground at his feet. The watchman at first startled, in a moment recovered himself, and was leav ing his nook to pick it up when, the wind lifting it, turned it over two or three times and left it in the street. `Let it lay. It is not worth the going after. I dare say it is a hundred years old. If people can't keep their shutters fast it is none of my business to pick 'em up for 'em if they are blown away. Hulloa! here comes some one through the storm, who looks ae if she would blow away in earnest. I wonder what can bring any body out such a night as this is. Nothing but death or the doctor.' The watchman ceased speaking, and watched the person who was approaching. It was a female, and by the faint rays of the lamp she was scantily dressed. A small hood and a thin dress that the wind entwined about her limbs was all her covering. She seemed scarcely able to struggle against the storm, yet still held on her way with perseverance. She came nearer and nearer the watchman, when her eyes fell on the shutter already halt buried in the drift. With a sharp, glad cry she sprung towards it and drew it from the snow, and raised it in her arms. The force of the wind bearing upon it overthrew her with it; but with a struggle she rose again, and placing it edge-wise to the wind, she turned back the way she had come, and hurried like a spectre across the dark square. `That poor woman has got only what is God's gift,' said the watchman. `I will let her go off with it, even if I have to pay old Jarvey for it myself if he should ask me what became of it after it was blown off.' `Thief! stop thief! Ho, watchman? ho! Where are you?' cried a shrill, cracked voice from the window which had parted with the shutter. `Stop her: stop her. There she runs across the square with my shutter. Stop thief, stop.' The watchman sprang out from his shelter into the street, and looked up to the window, at which, with a lantern in his hand, that shot its feeble glance out into the snowy atmosphere, stood a little shrivelled old man with a white worsted night-cap on, covering his ears, and an old green baize wrapper gathered by the fringes with one hand close about his throat. The snow was beating into his sharp, thin face, and the wind sweeping his long, coarse, gray locks about his eyes. `What is the matter, Uncle John?' cried the watchman. `Matter? Thieves! Robbers!' cried the old man in the same sharp, angry tone, sharper and more angry than the winds that howled about his domicile. The wind has torn off one of my shutters. I heard it go. I got up to look, and what should I see but a woman—a thief carrying it off—running away with it as fast as she could go. Stop her, watch! stop her! She has gone up Flag Alley. She went in that direction. Thieves, I say! thieves! Why don't you run after her, and bring back my shutter.' And the little man danced up and down with furious excitement, shook his lantern at the watchman, and then his fist, and sputtered unintelligible words which the storm drowned. `Let the woman go, Jarvey. She, I dare say, wants it for fire-wood. `Wants it for fire-wood. Wants my shutter for fire-wood! Yes, yes! a pretty how to do. Because people want, they may steal. A pretty pass. I'll complain of you. You connive! You are an abetter! What are you there for if not to catch thieves! and here you let one go without moving a foot.' `The shutter is not worth a ninepence, Mr. Jarvey,' answered the watchman. `I'll pay you for it.' `A ninepence! It's worth two dollars. Well, well, I'll report you, sirrah. I'll break you. If you don't do your duty I'll do it for you.' With these ominous words uttered in a tone of the bitterest rage, and in a voice that sounded more like the creaking of a rusty hinge than human articulation; John Jarvey, the miser, and dealer in old iron, rags and feathers, shut down his window and disappeared from it. `Now, I shall get into a scrape,' said the watchman, just for being good natured and having pity on that poor woman; for poor she was I know by her scanty dress; poor she was I know by her picking up a shutter; poor she was or she would not have been abroad in this cold storm; and I saw her pale thin face was full of sorrow. How it brightened at the sight of the old shutter. But if I don't go after it I shall lose my place, for old Jarvey is merciless, and I am too poor myself to lose the dollar a night I earn. He is stumbling down stairs. I will tell him I will go after the woman and get his shutter. As he spoke the bolt inside of the door against which he had been leaning was drawn sharply back, and the old iron dealer appeared, wrapped in an old black short cloak and a battered fur cap pulled down on his ears, so that only his little grey, hard eyes and the tips of his nose and chin were visible. Thick mittens were on his hands. In one hand he held a small bull's-eye lantern. His height was about five feet and an inch or two, and his thin legs were shrivelled to the mere anatomy of the bones. `You are a pretty watchman, sirrah!' croaked Mr. Jarvey; `we'll see to-morrow!' `I will go after the woman, if you say so,' said the watchman. `Say so! I do say so! You must go, or I will—you can follow her by her tracks in the snow.' `I'll pursue her,—you go in again and I will bring back the shutter.' `Bring it back aint enough,—you must bring her back,—you must arrest her! To let the thief go is a criminal offence. Bring back the thief too! `I will try and catch her.' `You must catch her—I'll go with you and you shall catch her! Come, sir, come! A pretty to do when a citizen has to get out of his bed o' nights, and such a night as this! to pursue thieves that steal right under a watchman's eyes!' `Well, sir, I'll take her, you may be sure,' answered the watchman, who felt like pitching the little miserly old fellow into the snow drift. He would gladly have let the woman escape; but he saw that unless he pursued her and recovered the shutter, he should be reported by Jarvey and lose his place, which he could not afford to part with, as he had a large family of his own. He, therefore, prepared to go after the wretched woman, but his heart burning with resentment against the inexorable cruelty of the man who would compel him to arrest her. He felt too that he must try diligently and earnestly to find her and recover the shutter, and also take her into custedy; for if he purposely delayeo or slighted the pursuit to give her time to get quite away, and the snow time to cover up her tracks, he would be blamed for not having caught her when he could have done so, and so equally be subjected to the censure of the city authorities. Therefore he felt that if he pursued at all he must pursue in earnest; though it was going heavily against his heart to do it. `You had best not go, Mr. Jarvey,' he added, seeing the old man step out of the door. `Yes, yes—I'll go to! I want to see that you do your duty. A pretty pass when citizens have to watch the watchmen!' As he spoke he removed the key of his door from the inner side of the lock, and placing it in the outer wards, locked the premises and placed the key in his pocket. `Now, come—come! I'll follow the tracks with my lantern. Look sharp you too,—if she aint found you'll have to answer for it to the city.' `I'll find her, Mr. Jarvey!' answered the watchman in a deep tone, as if he spoke with strong feeling. `I'll find her, sir, if she's above the earth!' And David Dalton, the stout, honest watchman, firmly resolved to execute his purpose to the letter. He knew that unless he arrested the woman, his own hearth-stone would need firewood also; and he had many little bodies to keep warm, and many hearty mouths to feed. The miser took the lead across the square, with the lantern, holding it close to the ground. They passed under the lofty walls of Fanueil Hall, and so entered the narrow avenue known as Flag Alley. The foot-prints of the woman were traced up the Alley, and once was seen the imprint of the end of the shutter, where it had dropped from her grasp into the snow. Half way up the Alley the footsteps were obliterated by the wind, as if the same kind power which had unhinged the shutter and cast it into the street for her, would now favour her escape, covering her foot-prints with friendly fingers. `I've lost 'em,' said old Jarvey, poking about with his bull's-eye lantern close to the ground. `Perhaps you can't see without your glasses—I'll find them,' answered David, with a sort of stern sadness in his tones. `I have a lantern brighter than yours.' As he spoke he took a dark-lantern from beneath his coat, raised the slides, and cast a bright glare upon the snow in the Alley. The faint trace of the track was now visible, and following it a few yards, they saw it turn into a narrow passage, between a wretchedly old house and a high board fence. David entered the narrow way, closely followed by the iron-monger, scuffling at his heels and muttering,— `To steal my shutter! I'll have her put in prison for this, that I will—for life, if I could! Bread and water and hard labor—nothing less!' CHAPTER II. THE ABODE OF POVERTY DISCOVERED. Old Jarvey and the watchman followed the track up the narrow passage way, between a row of old houses and a high board fence. The miser kept his body stooping close to the snow that he might not miss the tracks, notwithstanding Dalton went on before and kept them in sight by the aid of his lantern. `Do you still find 'em?' shrieked out the little man. Look sharp coz she may ha' turned in some o' these dog holes, or climbed the fence.' `Don't fear, old gentleman,' responded David, with utter contempt for the miserable wretch who was using all this vigilance to recover an old broken shutter that was not worth a sixpence for any thing but fire word, and to find and throw into jail the miserable creature who had taken it from the snow where the charitable winds had cast it. `There is the mark here where she set it down to rest,' said David. `She must ha' been a poor, weekly thing, Mr. Jarvey, not to be able to carry it, for it was dried till it was like pith for lightness. It is three times we've seen the mark where she has set it down in the snow. Suppose, sir, we let her go. Doubtless she needed it to warm her children or cook by.' `Children? Humph! what business has a poor woman with children if she can't support 'em without stealing? why don't she give 'em to the poor house? No, no! Cook by? Any body that has vittals to cook can get fire-wood. They are not so poor. But if she was— if it was to keep her from starving and freezing to death. I tell you, I will have my shutter and have her in gaol for thieving.' `You are a hard-hearted man, Mr. Jarvey.' `Hard-hearted! Yes, yes! I would rather be hard-hearted then soft-hearted if looking after one's own is hard hearted. The best reputation a man can have is that of being hard-hearted. People will let him alone. He'll never lose his money and property. There was my father, now, had the reputation of a `clever man!' It was the ruin of him. Every body borrowed his tools and never brought 'em back because he was a clever man! They borrowed money and never paid, him because he was a clever man. He would ride through the streets in his market-wagon, and all the boys in town would climb up upon it and steal his apples and nearly break his horse down because, forsooth, he had the reputation of a `clever man.' It was the ruin of him, sir. His kindness was his destruction. He died not worth a penny!' `I would rather be the father than the son, nevertheless,' said David. `Yes, yes: I dare say, but I would'nt,' chuckled the iron-monger. `But we've got to the end o' the alley. What do you find? Look sharp, David Dalton, for if you slack your duty from pity, I'll complain to the town. So you've got to find the thief or lose your place.' `Don't threaten me, Mr. Jarvey. I'll find her don't fear,' answered David, hardly able to suppress his indignation, but feeling that he must find her or lose his place; and when he thought of his little family at home he nerved himself anew to the search. He had come to the end of the alley where a narrow broken flight of steps led to a sort of plank platform running round the second story, of an old wooden tenement on the alley. By lifting his lantern above his head he could see that a door opened from this loose platform into the upper rooms of the house. The stairs inclined so, that he thought no one could ascend them in safety, until he discovered upon the steps the tracks of the pilferer of the shutter. The marks of the shutter as it was dragged up after her, were also visible. `Here the poor wretched woman lives,' said the humane watchman to himself. `I would rather lose ten dollars out-right, poor a man as I am, than follow her any farther. But it must be done. I can't lose my place, and I shall lose it, if Jarvey makes oath that I let the thief go without pursuing her. Nothing can save me, but I shall be dismissed, and then I may have to go and hunt up shutters to burn; for in these hard times there is five men to do one man's work, and the four have to live as they can.' `I see the tracks! Oh, see 'em!' cried the little man pressing forward, as David stood by the stairs reluctant to go up. `She's gone up these steps! I see the marks where she dragged my shutter!' `Yes. I see them, too, Mr. Jarvey!' `Hark! they are splitting it up. Don't you hear 'em? What bold thieves! Every soul of 'em in the house ought to go to gaol, if they aint bigger than a baby a week old. The whole hoard shall go. Come, push on and stop 'em splitting it up; coz I shan't get pay for it, and I want to get it back whole. I can't afford to lose my shutter. If they spoil it you shall pay for it, David Dalton. Up! up! Quick! You go first.' David began to mount the steps, the miser cowardly withdrawing behind, so that if any danger menaced the worst of it should fall upon the watchman. The steps bent and creaked beneath the heavy tread of David, and when he had gone up five of them, he stopped fearing they would give way. But shaking the frame work strongly, and finding it stand the shock he continued to mount up, followed by the timid, but cruel and hard-hearted iron-monger. The platform on which they arrived, was a narrow gallery such as is often built along the sides of carpenters' and other shops in country towns. It was covered a foot deep with snow, and at the farther end of it it had drifted to a level with the window. A door and this window were all the openings in the side of the tenement, which was an old fashioned gable, two and a half stories in height. The eves were so low that David's hat came even with them, and he could lay his hand upon the roof. There were no steps in the snow upon the platform save those of the person who bore the shutter. These though half-drifted over again led directly to the door; and by the side of the door was visible the mark in the snow where she had rested the shutter while she lifted the latch. `Softly, or she may take the alarm and we shall lose her,' said old Jarvey laying his hand upon the watchman's arm as he was about to lift the latch. `I have made up my mind old man to arrest the woman, so do not plague me with your doubts,' answered David angrily; and in his heart, as he saw the miser slip a little upon the snow and got his foot through a crack between the boards, he wished that he would tumble down and break his neck. A faint light now began to glimmer through the window upon the snow mouldings of the railings of the gallery, and the sounds of breaking boards fell upon the ears, while the light waxed brighter, and then the cheerful crackle of the flames were heard. `Quick, quick! They will burn up my shutter!' cried old `Feather-Few,' such being his popular designatum in the town, from a habit he had of giving short weight in the feathers sold. David, however, instead of opening the door ot once, moved softly along to look in at the window. Jarvey seeing his object stepped along after him. The window was much broken and filled up with paper and rags, but between them were many little openings by means of which David got a peep into the interior of the room. He gazed a minute or two and then removing his face from the aperture said in a husky voice, `Look in there, Mr. Jarvey.' The old man stood on tiptoe and peered in. They could not be seen from the interior inasmuch as the snow and dirt heaped upon the few remaining panes, destroyed their transparency. `I see the thief! She has half-burnt up my shutter!' cried Jarvey, in a querulous, angry tone. `You shall pay for it, David Dalton. It is good for nothing now. I'll have her in gaol, but you shall pay for it.' `Hist, I will pay for it. Look there in silence awhile, and I will watch them too, through this opening,' he said, finding an aperture by softly drawing out the sleeve of an old jacket. The old man's eyes rested only upon the blazing fragments of his shutter, as they sparkled and crackled on the fire-place—a wretched fire-place it was— whose bleak and rude aspect the light plainly revealed. It revealed also the miserable apartment and furniture, if a table, two or three chairs, a broken bedstead covered with a straw pallet, and three or four utensils for cooking could be called furniture. The walls which had once been plastered now revealed the lathing in huge scathes along the walls, while the ceiling was entirely divested of it. The floor was of rough boards and black with age, and the fireplace of crude brick-work, the mantle and all the carpenter-work having been piece by piece taken down and consumed in the fire-place by children of poverty, either those who now crouched about the burning shutter, or the former tenants of the ruined room. David turned his eyes from the wretched walls and furniture, with the firelight in all their barren poverty, to rest them upon three figures hovering over the flames upon the hearth. Upon the side of the fire-place towards the window, sat upon a broken stonejar, a very large framed, broad-backed woman, her head tied up in an old red and blue cotton pocket-handkerchief, the ends of which hung down her forehead, even below her eyes. She sat down to the fire from time to time, putting upon the cheering warm flame, a piece of Father Few's shutter, which lay by her, and which she tore to pieces as the flame needed feeding. She would then stretch her hands out to warm them with the additional heat. Her profile could only be seen, and that but uncertainly, on account of the corner of the low-falling handkerchief, and a patch over the eye. In front of the fire-place sat a small, delicate, fragile woman, pouring from a paper parcel, about a pint of beans into a stew-pan, which was filled with snow. David instantly recognised her as the person who had taken the shutter. She was about thirty seven or eight years of age, with dark soft eyes, and the remains of beauty destroyed by starvation and sorrow. She was speaking to the other, but David could not hear for the wind and storm what she said, but he saw that she looked glad and happy, as she raised her eyes to the other's face, and continued to prepare the mess of beans. He then put his ear to the opening instead of his eye, and heard her say the following words, in a pleasant manner: `Don't put on too much wood, dear, for it is hot enough to melt the snow and boil the beans! Oh, what a nice meal we shall have after eating nothing since morning, and then only a herring. God sent that shutter for me!' she said, putting the pan with the little mess of beans on the fire, with an air of satisfaction as if it was the nicest dish ever cooked for a King's table.' `Do you hear that, Feather-Few?' asked David in his stout blunt way, for he said that the Iron-monger following his example had turned his ear to the broken pane. `She says God sent for the shutter, and I believe so too! I should think it woold make your heart feel good to see what happiness your old shutter has produced. See! how they enjoy the fire it makes! Bless them, how warm they are getting! It is a good end the old shutter has come too, Mr. Jarvey; and as it is the first time any thing belonging to you has done any body any good, I would if I were you just let em enjoy it, just to feel how a charitable act makes a man feel about the heart. It must be a new feeling to you Mr. Jarvey!' `The women both shall go to jail,' answered Feather-Few who could think of nothing, heed nothing but the destruetion of his property before his eyes. `Come, ain't you goin' to break in upon em,' I'm shiverin standin here!' `Suppose we let 'em cook their mess, Mr. Jarvey. It'll do em good! I don't like to take em looking so starved. But bless me, what is thst an angel!' `A gal!—another jail bird! Three on em!' The person who had called forth the exclamation of surprise and admiration from David was a young girl of seventeen or eighteen years, of exquisite beauty. In feature and figure, she was faultless, though her dress was of the most ordinary description. She had just come into view from behind the jam of the chimney where she had been hitherto concealed by it. In her hands she held a flat piece of tin in which was spread a corn cake, which from her bare arms and the meal upon her hands she had been mixing upon a sort of shelf the edge of which was visible, protruding beyond the chimney flue. As the fire light shone upon her face, as she stooped to place the cake so that it might bake at the glowing coals of Feather-Few's shutter, David thought that he had never seen a face so beautiful, not even that of his own daughter whom in his paternal pride he believed the handsomest lass high or low in Boston. She spoke, and David substituted his ear again for his eye. Her voice was extremely musical. `Do you not feel chilled quite through, dear mother?' she said, looking up fondly into the face of the female who had taken the shutter from the street. `It was a fearful night for you to go out!' `No, I am quite warm! The exertion in bringing it here warmed me completely, dear Anny. And then it made me warm to think how we could have a fire and have our meal cooked!' `I feel that Providence directed you to this shutter! I think we should have perished without it, and poor Henry too! He will have something to eat when he wakes! Now he is getting better his appetite is coming to him!' `Poor dear boy! I wish I had something to give him to eat whenever he wants it! But we must not complain! we shall always find food and shelter, my child! God will not wholly desert us!' `To-morrow, now I can leave Harry, I shall try and get some work, if it is to make a shirt for three cents! Three cents will keep us from starving, mother! The employers at the shop will give me that, though they said that for every article they wanted made there were a dozen applicants, ready to take it at any price!' `These are, indeed, periless hard times! And then we have such a cloud hanging over us on account of poor John!' `Mother! Anny!' called a voice from the bed in the corner. David turned his glance in that direction and saw a boy, about twelve years old, rise up on his elbow, and gaze bewildered towards the group at the fire. He looked wasted by sickness, but his countenance was as handsome as that of the maiden. `I'm coming, dear mother,' responded Annie; and as she hastened to the bed-side, David saw, with a shock of deep emotion, that she was lame. Lovely in face and figure as she was, she was after all a cripple! This at once accounted to him for her remaining within when the delicate mother braved the storm to seek fire-wood. `What a brave fire! Did God send it?' he asked, in tones so touching, that tears came into David's eyes. `Yes, brother! And you shall have something good to eat in a few minutes,' she answered, patting him upon the temples and kissing them. `Mother would go out in the snow to find wood, and she saw a shutter in the street and brought it home!' `Blessed shutter!' cried the little fellow. `I shall eat and you will eat, and we shall be warm and happy. Blessed shutter!' `Hear that, sir! Hear those words Mr. Jarvey!' demanded David, in an im, pressive tone. CHAPTER III. THE CIRCLE ABOUT THE HEARTH-STONE. The tall, stout woman in the corner was in the meanwhile breaking up in her hands, piece by piece, one the panels of the shutter, and laying it upon the fire, not with lavish waste, but with an air of close, calculating economy of the fuel. The mother watched cheerfully the seething stew, and occasionally reached over to see how the maiden's corn-cake was coming forward. Altogether, it was a scene of happiness! Poverty, cold and starvation had been driven from the spot by Feather Few's shutter. `Do you see, Mr. Jarvey, how much good your shutter has done? You have not done so much yourself in all your life. So let the good that is here done be done, and let us go our way; though first I would recommend you, if you want to sleep sound, to leave with them a five dollar note. They can buy wood and food with it, and will not be tempted to steal; though I do not call this stealing, what has been done to-night!' `You're as bad as the rest,' cried Jarvey, in a loud tone. A pretty watchman, to defend theft! I want to know if you're going to go in and take up that woman? Do it at once, or lose your place, David Dalton!' This was spoken in an elevated tone; and David, who was still looking through the window, saw by their startled looks, that they had overheard his words above the racket of the storm. Every eye was turned quickly and alarmingly to the window. `Yes, I must do it, I suppose,' answered David, `and now as well as any time.' He left the window and approached the door. Feather-Few came close to his heels. David opened his lantern to find the latch, and then pressed upon the door to open it, as the latch did not lift up. `Is it fastened?' asked Jarvey, quickly. `Yes, it seems so!' `Then kick it in! you're a strong man! kick it in! It is old and rickety! Break it down! The law will allow it, because you are an officer in discharge of your duty. Pity but you'd discharged it better and I should'nt been out in this snow-storm at this time o'night running the risk of the umbago and rheumaties!' David's children and his wife starving and calling upon him for bread rose to his mind. `It is either they so dear to me or these!' he cried! If I let these escape mine will suffer! God forgive me!' With this ejaculation he drove his iron heel against the door. It burst from its hinges, opening the reverse of its natural mode, for the fastening upon the latch was stronger than the rusty hinges and screws. He found himself in a dark passage. The floor creaked and bent alarmingly to his weight, for David was a large formed man as well as a large hearted man. He opened his lantern and saw that the place that he was in was a square entry with a door-way before him, the door gone, probably for fire-wood, and a vacant room beyond. On his right was a closed door, which he knew from its situation must open directly into the room where he had seen the wretched and interesting family rejoicing over the fragments of the miser's shutter. The miser stood behind him shivering with the cold, yet in his own chilliness he felt not for others who suffered from cold. He was too selfish to feel the woes of his fellow-beings. Nothing was evil unless it were evil to himself? Instead of pitying, those in the room saw that he felt on his own form how painful cold was, even when unaccompanied by hunger, he cursed them for heing the cause of his sufferings; when the true cause was his own avarice and inhuman revenge that brought him out of his bed at night. Bad men are always inclined to make many distinctions. It is a pleasure to correct that made by Mr. Jarvey. He stood shivering behind David, and grasping in one hand a stout cudgel. He stood behind David because he was a timid man, and liked to be second when danger might be before him; and he grasped the cudgel because he was a coward; for he did not know, his craven soul whispered, but that the woman might show fight—might seize some murderous weapon to defend herself, and perhaps kill or do him damage. He knew that men had been killed by women; and a woman that was poor enough to steal a shutter was bad enough to murder him when he come after it. So between cowardice and avarice Feather-Few trembled and kept close behind the tall stalwart watchman. His tremors were lest he should be harmed, yet his avarice kept him close to David, that if the woman attempted to escape he might be in the way to knock her down with his cudgel. David knocked upon the door, and pausing two or three seconds, raised the latch and entered. His quick eye showed him at a glance, that the tall stout female with the handkerchief about her temples had disappeared. The young girl was standing by the bed-side clasping her arms around the boy as if to encourage him, while at the same time her cheek was pale, and her fine dark eyes expanded with alarm. Yet she stood firm, and gazing upon the open door and at the figures of the watchman and his companions. The woman who had taken the shutter was standing by the fire with the cake in her hand as if just about to place it upon the table. David saw that her cheek was flushed, and that she looked very much frightened, yet tried to assume a look of composure. Indeed, he thought she had caught up the cake to appear, to whoever entered, to be quietly engaged about domestic duties. There was more than sudden surprise at being intruded upon at such an hour in such a manner, he thought visible in the features of both; a certain manner like that of suspicion; precisely, it occurred to him like the aspect guilty persons would wear at the appearance of officers of justice. But that it was guilt he could not believe; for he was confident that the woman in taking the shutter from the snow, took it without the least idea that she was committing a theft. If, then, it was guilty apprehension that alarmed them, he felt that it must be for something else, besides fear of being called to account for the shutter. Jarvey saw with his quick, jealous eyes this expression of guilty alarm, at least, so he interpreted it, and calling out in a shrill, savage voice, in which was mingled a tone of triumph, said, `So, so! you may well look guilty! Caught in the very act of burning up my shutter! You must go to jail for it.' And Feather-Few brandished his cudgel as he spoke, and running up to the hearth, tore from the flames a piece of the shutter that had just began to ignite. `Seize 'em, watchman!' `It is only for the shutter then, thank God!' exclaimed the woman, looking very much relieved. David heard the exclamation, and saw the instant change in her manner with surprise. `There is something they have done worse than taking the shutter then,' he thought to himself. `But that is not my affair.' He looked around again searchingly for the broad-shouldered woman, but could neither see her, nor see where she could have disappeared. He thought it strange she should have hidden herself; but as his business lay with the one who remained, he turned his attention to her, where she still stood before the hearth with the half-baked cake in her hands, her eyes fixed upon his face with mingled alarm and curiosity. `I am very sorry, ma'm, said David, but I fear I shall have to take you off to the watch-house. I don't like to trouble poor folks, for poverty is burden enough, but you were seen to take—' `Steal, Dalton, steal!' interrupted the little iron-monger, looking at the poor woman as if he would annihiiate her with his eyes. `Well steal then, though I don't look upon it in that light, Mr. Jarvey. You were seen ma'm to steal the shutter as it was blowed off from the window, and I have tracked you here, and found the shutter burning on your hearth.' `Yes, woman, and you must go to jail for it!' cried the little man. `It is my shutter! my property! The wind blew it down and you catches it up and runs of with it. Downright larceny! Take her watchman!' `Indeed sir,' answered the woman trembling and looking very much frightened at the mention of the jail, `indeed sir,' and she turned her large tearful eyes upon the iron-ribbed visage of the dimunitive looking iron-monger, `indeed sir, I did not steal it. I saw it lying upon the snow. I was out searching for fire-wood, hoping that the blast would unloose some shingles, or cast something up that I might have wherewith to make a fire to cook food, for we have been nearly perishing.' `A pretty excuse! I tell you it's no excuse at all! Every thief might plead that he wanted what he stole! a pretty pass the world would come to! What is your poverty to me? I don't know you. You are no relation to me that I should have to supply you with fire-wood; and if you was I wouldn't. Relations are blood-suckers! I havn't but one in the world, and I'll make more out o' him than he ever will out o' me! I hate poor people! Come, no whining, you must go! Lay hands on her, Dalton.' `I'll arrest her, Mr. Jarvey, but I'll not lay hands on any woman save in kindness, answered David. `Come ma'm put on your things, for you must go with me to the watch-house.' Oh! sir, have compassion!' cried the poor woman clasping her hands. `You look like a kind man; you look as if you pitied our poverty; you speak mildly. Oh! do not drag me away from my child! See my dear boy there! he has been lying for weeks ill with the typhus fever. He is just beginning to get well, and he would have been well long ago if I could have given him proper nourishment.' `Oh, do not tear me from my children. I did not steal—oh, I did not intend to steal your shutter, sir,' she cried turning from David to the miser, and clasping her hands before him. `Do not send me to jail, I cannot go. I will work and pay for your shutter; I knew not that it was good for anything but to burn; I found it in the street, and in the snow. Have pity on me and mine!' `You can't move me, woman,' said Jarvey with a cold smile. `I have heard women talk, and don't mind tears and stage-action. You stole the shutter, this watchman here saw you; if it had been no more than a shingle blown from my roof, you had no right to it; it was mine. So, stop your cries, and come along with us.' `Mother, dear mother, you shall not be torn from us,' cried the boy springing from the bed and flying to her side, where he stood with his thin hand clenched and his bright sick eyes flashing with proud defiance. `Sir,' exclaimed the young girl approaching David, and laying her hand upon the sleeve of his rough coat, and gazing up into his face with earnest looks, `oh do not take away my mother; she is innocent of any intention of wronging any one. Sir, we are very poor, and suffering for every necessary of life.— My mother weut out in the storm hoping Providence would direct her to some fuel that we might not perish for want of fire and of food. She found this shutter in this street; she seized it and brought it home with scarce strength to lift it; yet joy gave her the strength she had not else. Had you seen her face lighted with smiles as she entered with it, sir, and witnessed our joy at the thought that we should have fire, and could took the little food we had to eat. She did not mean to take what was of value to another. Do not drive her to prison, sir! She is our mother, and poor as we all are, we live only in being together. If you take her you will only increase our wretchedness, already more than we can well bear! You look kindly, sir, I know that you are not hard-hearted; tears tremble in your eyes, even now. Oh sir, be pitiful and have compassion on a wretched family, for though very poor, sir, we are honest.' `Gammon!' ejaculated Jarvey in a tone of contempt. `Silence, Mr. Jarvey,' cried David with stern indignation. `You have no right to insult misfortune. I believe on my soul you have got no more heart than a fish.' `I want to know are you goin' to take this woman, or not, David Dalton? If you aint then I'll go and see if I can't get an officer, and if I cross that are thresh-hold to go after one, you are no longer one o' the city watchmen if I can get you broke.' `You see, ma'am how it is,' said David with evident emotion. `Mr. Jarvey says if I don't take you off, he'll get me turned out o' my place. I saw you take the shutter, and didn't trouble you, for I knew that you wanted it, or you wouldn't have been abroad in such a night so poorly clad. But the owner heard the shutter blow off, and saw you take it and go away with it. He came down, as you see him in cap and coat, with his lantern, and said I must pursue you or he would inform against me, and get me turned out. I would gladly have refused ma'am, but I am a poor man, and have a family and I don't know what else I could do, as in these hard times, my trade, which is that of a house-wright is overrun and I can't get work, for nobody's building. All I live by is my watchman's wages. So I had to come, and I would rather now pay three dollars than make you go with me; but what can I do? I offered to pay him for the shutter, but he won't have nothing less than the mean revenge of putting you into jail. It goes against my heart to do this, but either you or I must be the victim.' `Then I will go,' answered the woman firmly. `You have shown yourself to be a good and honest man and I see that you feel for me, and are only doing your duty.' `Hear that, Mr. Jarvey. Do you see what a noble creature you would drag to jail for taking a piece of wood to keep her family from perishing. Come, Jarvey, be a man for once, and see how it feels to do a good action. Let the woman alone, and let us go.' `I tell you I will not yield an inch,' answered the iron-monger. `If you won't take her I will,' and he extended his hand to place it upon the woman's shoulder, when the boy, who all the while stood before her in an attitude to protect her, struck him a blow in the face so that he staggered back. He uttered a yell of fury, not pain, for the blow was not heavy though given with will, and made a stroke with his cudgel at the head of the woman. It was caught by the open palm of David. `Stop, Feather-Few; you have only got what you deserve, and I only wish it had been a little more. Dare to harm either of them and I will take you in my arms and toss you through the window as I would a cat.' CHAPTER IV. THE ARREST. The miser muttered some words which David neither understood nor cared to understand; for while he yielded to his wish in arresting the woman he entertained towards him, as his blunt language showed, feelings of the most thorough contempt. `Now, ma'am,' said David, `as you see how matters are with me, if you will just suffer me to escort you to the watch-house, I'll promise you shall come to no harm. In the morning I'll see the Justice and tell him all about the matter and get you off. Don't fear but all will come out right in the end.' `My mother shall not go to gaol,' said the boy, very positively and clinging closer to her. `Oh, sir,' cried Annie to the iron-monger, her beautiful faced bathed in tears, `oh, do not proceed to this extremity.' `David Dalton, I am tired of this farce. Are you going to take the woman?' `You must come, ma'am. I see no other way,' answered David, with emotion. `I'll see that you are treated as respectfully as if you were my own wife.' `Do not say a word, Henry, my boy. I must go. I am innocent of theft, and I shall not be detained,' said the woman, trying to appear composed at that dreadful moment when the horrors of a goal stared her in the face. `I shall be back to breakfast.' `Breakfast?' responded the young girl, sadly. `We shall have no breakfast to welcome you, mother! But your presence will be more joyful than food to us!' And she cast her arms about her and kissed her. `Sir,' she said to David, `you see my mother is not strong. Take me in her stead. I will bear all the punishment!' `No, Anny, you must stay to take care of Henry. You are his sole nurse. He will miss you more than he will me. Besides the watch-house is no place for virtuous young girl. I have made up my mind to go with the good watchman. Do no fear on my account. I shall be protected. In the morning I shall be suffered to come back to you. Good bye, dear children. Now, sir, I am ready,' she said, with wonderful firmness. `Well; I think you have delayed long enough,' squeaked the iron-monger impatiently, moving towards the door and drawing the ear-laps of his cap over his ears to prepare for the cold to which he was to expose himself. `Ready?' repeated David, looking at the thin dress and at the shawl-handkerchief which she put hastily about her neck, and then at a wretched hood she held in her hand. `You will perish without more clothing.' `It is all I have, sir. Doctors' medicines and food have taken every thing, piece by piece, for money, to pay for them.' `You are very yoor. I will lend you my over-coat,' he said, taking it off and throwing it around her. `You will perish without it.' `Good watchman,' said the boy, taking him by the hand, `will you bring my dear mother back in the morning.' `I will, my boy, if I can.' `I know you can.' `Where shall I find her, sir, if she does not come home?' asked the young girl, grasping his other hand. `God bless my heart. It will break out-right with this; said David, almost sobbing. `Take heart, good children, your mother shall return in the morning, or I will come and tell you. I swear to you, Feather-Few, that I would not lay finger upon her to take her to the watch-house, if I didn't feel sure the Justice wouldn't detain her in the morning when he hears the case; and he shall hear it, to your confusion.' `We shall see to whose confusion,' answered Jarvey. `Judges don't wink at larcenies. They hav'nt soft hearts like your's you'll, find. I'll swear the woman stole my shutter and you must say you saw her do it, and that we found the shutter half burned up on her premises. I'll put a stop to stealing from me. She shall be an example. I'll make the poor people fear me as they would a hyena. She shall be made an example of. Not three days ago a boy stole three ten penny nails from my floor, and I had him sent to the house of correction for six months. The judge, like a wise man, said he ought to go; for though the nails wern't of much vally they might have been; and the boy that would steal three nails would steal three cents or three iron hoops. Come, tramp, woman!' `Don't be alarmed, good woman, about your children here. Here is a half dollar which I will give the boy. It will help along a little till better turns up. Now come, ma'am. Don't hold on your mother, my little fellow. Be a man and let her go with me.' `I wish I were a man,' answered the little fellow, `I would not let her go!' David opened the door, out of which Feather-Few darted, for he thought the boy's eye flashed dangerously, and he did not know what he might not do in his resentment. David followed, taking the woman by the hand. She strove to suppress her own griefs and to comfort her children. `One word with my daughter,' said she as the outer-door was reached: and stepping back she whispered a few words into the ears of the weeping girl. `Tell him, Annie, not to expose himself on my account, that they will let me come back again!' `Yes, mother!' I wid not let him run any risk! Oh, it seems to me as if Heaven had filled our cup now to the brim!' `It can be still worse, remember, Annie, if he's taken!' she said impressively. `Yes, indeed it can! Oh, may God have pity on us!' `He will in his good time! Good night, dear, and keep them both up in heart!' `I will try to me, though I am ready to sink myself!' David spoke, and the poor woman, embracing once more her daughter and boy, turned and followed the watchman. The storm still filled the atmosphere, and the wind was piercing cold. It chilled the body of the poor woman as she stepped forth upon the gallery. The snow was drifted knee deep upon it. `You are a little woman, ma'am, let me convey you down the steps to the alley,' said David, suiting the action to the word; and gently he bore her down the shaking stairs as if she had been an infant, and almost as easily. The iron-monger went down first, and with his lantern opened lighted the way before them through the narrow alley. `Let me down, now, I can walk,' said the poor woman. `I thank you for your kindness, sir!' `Not at all, ma'am! I will do any thing I can for you to show you kindness. I hope you see how it is! I must do my duty!' `I see it, sir!' `I am glad you are so sensible a woman as to understand my situation, as I see you do! If that miserable little man before us had a heart that could be seen in a needle's eye, if one looked sharp for it, I shouldn't have to perform such an unpleasant business as this!' `Do you think, sir, the judge will keep me?' she asked as she walked on by his side down Flag Alley, the little iron-monger turning round every fifth step to see if they were coming. `No, ma'am, he wont, I'm sure! He shan't if I can say a word to be heard. Bless me! there you are down! You are too weakly, ma'am, to foot it through this deep snow,' he added as he raised her again upon her feet! I have half a mind to go back with you and let old Feather's do his worst! `No, let me go on now? I wouldn't have you lose your place, sir!' `What a good-hearted woman you are! You deserve a better fate. But, ma'am, to fall into old Jarvey's clutches is as bad as falling into old Cloven Hoofed's. I never heard any body say a good word of him yet; and you have had a specimen of him to-night!' `Come on, watchman! Don't lag behind! It's a plaguey cold night! Push on with the prisoner!' `I shall take my own time, Mr. Jarvey! I can't walk faster than the poor woman, and I don't mean to drag her to please no man! She'll be at the watch house in good time, for I'm resolved you shan't have the satisfaction of getting me put out o' my place. You can't say a word now, for I've got her, if I didn't follow her when she took the infernal shutter!' They now crossed Dock Square, and came opposite the old house where Jarvey lived—from one of the windows of which the shutter had been blown into the street. Here the iron-monger came to a stand. `Go on with her! I shan't foller, for I'm near froze to death, as it is,' he said. `If you see fit to let her escape, Mr. Tender-heart, you'll be the sufferer. I shall be up to the Police bright and early to enter my complaint, and if she isn't there to answer, then I guess there'll be a complaint entered against the watchman of this beat, David Dalton by name! So good night!' With these words, squeaked out in a shrill, malicious alto tone, the little wretch fumbled at the door of his house with his key, which with some difficulty, on account of the numbness of his fingers, he at length got into the lock. He then darted in and disappeared from Dalton's sight. `Well, ma'am, there is one comfort,' said David, as he moved on in the direction of the watch-house, `and that is that God above will judge that man for this night's deeds. I'll yet punish him for it some day before he dies; for I am as great a sufferer, ma'am, in compelling you to go to the watch-house, almost as great a sufferer as yourself, ma'am!— But I must do it or lose my place, ma'am, and I hope you'll forgive me, you and yours!' `Indeed, sir, I have nothing against you,' answered the poor woman, `for I see this evil man has you in his power quite as much as he has me!' `That is the truth, ma'm. When I think of my wife and children—I have five of them, ma'm, and good children they are too—I feel that I ought not to run the risk of losing my place, which is the only way I have had the last eight months to support them, ever since those great bank-failures and hard times came upon us all. My heart bled when I looked on your two and thought of mine; but I could'nt help doing what I have. I should'nt wonder if you cursed me; and you don't know how it relieves me to see you feel so kindly and seem so to understand the matter. But I only take you, ma'm, just to keep my place, and in the morning I shall be the first to see the judge and tell him your case exactly, and I think if he has a man's heart in his breast he will let you go at once!' `Indeed I hope so! My poor, poor family at home! If I am sent to jail or—' `They can't send you to jail, ma'am! It'll only be to the House o' correction perhaps for sixty days!' `Sixty days! What will become of me and mine?' `The judge won't do it, ma'm! I only mean to say what is the most that he can do, if they make out you stole the shutter which they can't do!' `The House of Correction is, I am told worse than the jail or as bad!' `It amounts to the same thing. I'd as lief be put in one as the other! There, now we're round this corner the wind don't blow so hard as in Ann street and the snow hasn't drifted, so you can walk along better! Are you tired, if you be I will car'y you, ma'm!' `No, sir, I can get on very well!' `Hold firm to my arm. That is it! What became of that other woman at this fire, ma'm?' asked David who had several times before set out to ask this question but it escaped his mind. `Sir! what woman?' she asked with quick, nervous apprehension, and releasing his arm with the suddenness of surprise. `The large stout woman! I looked through the window before going in and saw her. She was breaking up the shutter. But when I entered the room she was gone!' `Did you see her face! Did you—' `Why, ma'm, how your teeth chatter! You must be chilled to death! The watch-house is but a few steps further on. Shall I carry you the rest o' the way!' `No, sir! I can walk! Did you say that it was a woman you saw?' She asked with emphasis upon the word. `Yes, with a red handkerchief tied about her head! She was tall and larger but I could'nt see her face well!' `Yes, there was such a person;' she replied as if suddenly relieved by his answer. `She left as soon as you were heard at the out-side door!' `Oh, a neighbor, perhaps!' answered David; `yet his curiosity not by any means satisfied; for in looking about the room he had seen no place where the individual would have disappeared. The bed was a low truckle and would hardly have taken a cat under it. There was no door but that by which he entered; and so the mystery of her disap pearance perplexed him and excited his curiosity. He now saw that his captive was greatly embarrassed by his inquiring, and not wishing to annoy her he let her pass, though puzzled to guess how she had escaped from the room, and why she should have escaped and not the others if they had been guilty of any acts which they anticipated would bring officers upon them. `You are sure that it it was a woman?' demanded the female in such an earnest and peculiar manner that the suspicion that she might not have been a woman flashed irresistably upon David's mind. But woman or man where had the individual vanished? He did not, however, reveal to her his suspicion. He simply answered: `Yes; it was not the boy for he was in the bed! But have we one at the watch house?' `Stop, sir! Stay, good watchman one moment she cried earnestly. `Well, ma'm! what do you wish to say?' he asked kindly. `I know you are kind and honest and generous and wish evil to no one, Of your goodness of heart I have had proof, though I am at this moment your prisoner! Now will you promise me that you will never allude to this woman! Will you give me your promise good watch man, that you will not speak of having seen a woman there?' `Certainly I will, ma'm! If it will gratify you!' `It will indeed, sir! Oh you know not what depends upon secrecy! That evil man! Did he see her too?' `Yes; but he thought of nothing but his shutter! He will not think of her again. But why shall I promise?' `I cannot tell you. Yet I should not fear to trust you. I may have to trust you yet!' `If you do ma'm, be sure I will be your friend,' answered David, as he opened the door of the watch house. CHAPTER V. THE INMATES OF THE WATCH HOUSE. The place to which David conducted the woman was a low wooden edifice, one story in height, and situated at the corner of Hanover street and a narrow lane. It had a door and window on the street, both defended by heavy shutters with bars and bolts. Upon opening the door he entered a room about fourteen feet square in the centre of which was a stove. Around it sat two or three watchmen upon a semicircular bench, and in an arm-chair, directly in front of the door sat a stout fleshy man in red whiskers, who was the lieutenant of the watch for that ward.— The watchmen had evidently just come in, as they were covered with snow and were warming their hands and feet at the stove. The lieutenant was wrapped in an ordinary surtout, his heavy apparel for out doors hanging upon a peg within reach. About the room on the walls were suspended to rows of pegs, heavy watch-coats, glazed hemlets, watchmen's short staves armed with hook and spear, gloves, caps, mufflers and other apparel. Gver each peg was a number indicating the peculiar ownership of what hung upon it. The room was comfortably warm, and the party about the stove, which at one corner was heated red hot, seemed to be in the best of humors, as they were laughing very loud when David entered. `Ah here is number 8 come with a cove,' said one of the watchmen, looking at David and his charge. The lieutenant of the watch, who was called by courtesy Captain, by his men, hereupon half turned his eye, and said composedly, `Ah, Davy, what have you there?' `A poor woman, captain, who found a shutter in the street which had blown off from one of old Jarvey's windows.— The old miser said she must be pursued and I had to go after her, or lose my place, though I would gladly let her gone off clear. You see she is a poor body, and she needed fire-wood this cold night,' added David, removing his coat from her person. `Stand back, Jeffrey, and let her warm herself. She hasn't seen a fire like this, in an age, I'll warrant me!' The poor woman drew near the stove with an air of humility and shivering with cold. Jeffrey's the scotchman moved back and gave her a place on the bench. She hesitated to take it!' `Sit there, good woman,' said David kindly. `Get well warm before you go into the lodging room!' `So, mistress, you stole a shutter, eh?' observed the red-whiskered lieutenant, eyeing her from beneath his shaggy brows. His manner was authoritative and disagreeable, like that of bitterness in the possession of temporary power. `Sir, I did not steal it, answered the woman fervently. `I found it in the street. My family were perisning with cold and for food and—' `Hush old woman! The same old tale.' `No it is not the same old tale, Captain,' said David stoutly. The shutter was an old rickeny affair not worth fourpence. I saw it blown off into the street and did not think it worth while to pick it up, when this poor woman come shivering along in the blast and catching it up with a glad cry fled with it as if she had found the treasures of the Indies! So I let her go with it, for it was no theft and not worth the trouble of calling to her; besides unless the poor body had wanted it very much she would not have taken it. So I felt glad that she had found it. `Too tender-hearted by half, Davy,' ejaculated the lieutenant emitting a cloud of smoke from his mouth for he had just lighted a pipe. `Your humanity, as you call it, Dalton, 'll lose you your place yet. You remember the sassenger-case.' `Yes, I do; and I would do the same again, captain.' `Well, you might but I would'nt,' said one of the watchmen with No. 2 on his helmet. `I would let a man go to jail if he was old as methusalah afore I'd pay for what he stole!' `But the old man that took the sausages from the door was starving to death; for he began to eat them down raw as I would eat a carrot,' answered David. `Besides I only had to pay the shop-man forty cents to let him go.' `I would'nt have done it,' answered No. 3. `A man caught pilfering ought to be taken up.' `I would rather have paid twice as much rather than lugged that white-headed old man to the watch-house!' `Yet you like to have lost your place for not doing it when the head captain of the watch knew it,' said the lieutenant. `But I did'nt lose it, lieutenant after the captain heard all the case.' `But in this case old Jarvey would'nt take pay, oh?' `No. He made me follow the track of the woman and went himself with me, and I found the house, and the shutter half-burned up on the hearth. But it was such a wretched place and the family seemed to suffer so that I felt that I should rather take two dollars and give to the poor woman to buy wood and food rather than take her off. But Feather Few insisted she should be arrested and brought here or he would complain of me, he said, for winking at theft. So I had to bring her. But I mean to see the Judge early in the morning, and I know I shall get her clear in spite of Jarvey who means to be there to prosecute her! `There ant no use talking to the Judge, Davy,' answered the Captain, knocking the ashes from his pipe; and looking into it and seeing that it had gone out he said, pompously, `No 3, give me a coal if you please.' No 3 took up a coal in a small pair of iron tongs and dropped it respectfully into the bowl of the Captain's pipe. `There ant no use blarneying his honor,' he resumed when he found that his pipe drew again; `he is case hardened to such things. And it's natral he should be seein' as many as from ten to twenty brought up every morning. He, by and by, begins to think they are all alike and lump 'em all together.' `I don't believe the Judge is such a man,' answered David, warmly. `He has the reputation of being a humane and just Judge!' `Well, you try him to-morrow. He 'll ask you did the woman take the shutter and carry it off. You must say yes. Jarvey will swear that he saw it half burned up on her fire, and the Judge, as a matter of course, will send her up for sixty days, or three months, and call the next case. You may tell him she was poor and freezing. He will answer you that of course she was, he supposed that, or she would'nt have taken the shutter. So, good woman,' said the Captain, with a sort of patronizing majesterial air, `you may look upon yourself as hooked for sixty days and your board paid out of the public purse!' The poor woman who had listened with intense interest in this conversation, buried her face in her hands and sobbed, audibly, `My poor children!' `Do not despair, ma'am,' said David kindly, going up to her and laying his hand upon her arm. `Things won't be vuite so bad, if they be I'll see that your children wont suffer, if I have to eat only half a meal myself.' `Oh, sir, God in Heaven will reward you!' cried the poor woman in thrilling tones of gratitude. `If the prisoner is got warm and comfortable, Davy, you can show her in to the lodging room; for I guess you've been off your're beat about long enough. Come, woman, get up and foller him into that door!' This command issued from the lieutenant as he sat at his case with his feet raised upon an iron fender that surrounded the stove. She rose tremblingly and looked at David with an air of helplessness. `She don't seem to feel at home,' observed No. 3, coarsely. `I guess she ha'nt slept in a watch-house afore. But ma'am, you'll find comfortable quarters and no mistake. We provide well for the town's children while they is under our particular charge!' `Come, ma'am, I will show you the room,' said David. `Oh, do not leave me!' she cried, pressing his arm and looking round alarmed upon the harsh unfeeling brows of the three men. `You will be safe, here! No one will harm you, ma'am,' answered David, opening one of the two doors that were on the back side of the room. It was a greasy, dirty looking door, and one of the panels had been replaced by a rough piece of board nailed upon the mounting. Over this door was the words, `Female Apartment,' and over the one next to it a similar sign, having upon it the words, `Male Apartment.' Both doors opened into long narrow rooms, separated by a plank partition; and walls of the room were seats and `bunks,' or low berths for the persons detained through the night. Into the male apartment the two watchmen, at the stove, had just turned in two men whom they had caught prying about a shop window, under circumstances of suspicion, and upon whom they found burglars tools. These men were now very noisy and were banging at the door, and were calling upon the watchmen to bring them something to drink. The sound of their voices was so near that the poor woman thought she was about to be placed with them. `I hope I am not to be put with those men, good Mr. Dalton!' she cried, drawing back as he opened the door. `No, ma'm. Do you see these words?' he added, pointing to the sign over the door. `You will find only women in here!' `Thank you, sir!' she said, entering the dimly-lighted room with a sort of cheerful alacrity, and appeared as if much relieved from her fears. `Good night, ma'am. I'll be here right and early, and go up to the court with you,' said David. `Old Jarvey shant have his wish, be assured of it. You will at once be dismissed as soon as the judge sees you, and hears what I've to say about you.' `God will bless you, sir, for your goodness,' answered the woman, gratefully, as David gently closed the door upon her. What a sinking of the heart: what a dying away of hope she felt as the pleasant and sympathising face of this friend disappeared. She realised for the first time all her destitution and the horrors of her situation. She was a poor helpless female in the hands of rude men, and she was to be arraigned in the morning for a crime! Crime? She felt she had committed none. She felt that in the eye of Heaven and of humane beings she was innocent. In her own heart and intent she was innocent. But still she trembled. She knew that if the judge listened to the Iron-monger's tale, that she would be sentenced. She knew well that the law in its stern impartiality took no account of the circumstances that led the guilty to do crime. She knew that the law took cognizance only of the fact—the asked fact. If, therefore, Jarvey could make out to the satisfaction of the judge that she stole the shutter, all David's influence would not benefit; nay, she felt that, on the contrary, every word he should speak in her favor might injure himself, as it would be regarded by the court as an effort to exculpate his conduct in not pursuing and arresting her in the outset. The room was lighted by a japanned lamp, hanging against an upright beam in the centre of the long-room. The funnel from the stove in the front apartment traversed the room along the ceiling and warmed the air of it. By the faint muddy light of the lamp, she saw that two of the bunks were occupied by women of the most wretched appearance. One had her head bound up, and the other was intensibly drunk. Upon a bench sat a short stout female and a young girl of fourteen. The elder individual had a bloated face, and looked like a virago. The girl who was about fourteen, had a handsome face, but it bore a reckless, dissipated expression as if she had been early initiated into vice. The stout woman, seeing the new comer stop and regard her, and hesitate whether to advance to the bench, cried out in a coarse way, `Go, don't be afraid cozzy; we aint goin' to whip yer. Forge along here on your thin shanks, and take a seat. What, have the Charlies got you in jar?' `Charlies, marm?' repeated the woman, taking a seat rather as a measure of securing herself from insult than as desirable in such suspicious company. `Charlies are Hookies, woman. You are a green one! Never was here afore, I'll swear.' `No, I never was!' sighed the poor female. `Well, you're here now, and there's always a first time, though you've waited till you're pretty old. Why I was in a watch 'us afore I was sixteen!' `I ain't fifteen yet, Bess,' cried the girl with a tone of decided self-approbation and triumph at having beat her mature friend by a year or more. `What have they got you up for, they?' demanded rather than inquired Bess, looking at her with a hard eye and a superior kind of air, as if she took in at once what a poor, sickly, meek, virtuous being was in her presence. `I am accused of stealing,' answered the poor woman, faintly. `But I did not steal!' `So every thief says. It's a mean game, stealin', unless one can lay her flippers on coin—then it's an honor!— Now, this young girl was taken up for taking a watch and a purse to-night from a youngster that called to see her.' `And what a row he made when he found it out, interrupted the young girl, laughing. `He hollared to the watch till he had a dozen round, but I have hid the jumbles where he won't be the wiser, though they've got me!' `They'll send you up for six months, Juley,' said Bess, in a careless but encouraging tone,' and then when you have served your time honestly out, you can have your watch and money to go upon.' `That I mean to do,' answered the youthful thieveress, in a very decided tone, confirming her resolution with a very round oath. `I suppose you'd like to know what I am in for,' said the stout woman to the stranger, who had listened with a shrinking heart, shocked beyond measure, at being in the presence and contact with such depravity. `Indeed, I am not anxious to know.' `Well, I'll tell you, so if you have a husband, you'll know whose example to foller. I'm tuck up jist for givin' my old 'un a confounded whippin'. I keeps a tavern, ye see! and he must come and borry money from the till without leave, sir! and I gives him a backhander and he hits me a tipper under the peepers! I breaks his head with a porter bottle, and he hollers murder, and then there's the devil to pay! Charlies run in. I fight hard. No use! They fight harder, three to one, and here I is!' CHAPTER VI. A SCENE IN THE LOCK-UP. When David returneed to the store, after letting the woman he had charge of into the bunk-room, the captain said, with the tone and air of a connosieur, `Davy, that is a pretty little woman of yours, though something pale; but good points, good points! She seems not to like here much. But sixty days in the House of Commons over to South Boston will wear off the squeamishness.' She is a very nice woman captain, and a very virtuous, lady-like person I am sure, poor and bad off as she is now,' said David, feelingly. `I hope you will see that she is treated kindly, for she is not used to this.' `Don't you fear, Davy. She isn't so young and handsome that there's any danger I shall look at her a second time. Yet, as I'm a gentleman, she has been handsome. She has points! Her eye is good and her mouth fine!' `You are altogether too free and easy in your talk, captain, for an officer of the watch,' said David, in a tone of grave reproof. `I think, Dalton, we will have you appointed Chaplain to our Ward, said the captain, with a laugh. David made no reply, but hanging his club upon his arm by the hook, he went out and was closing the door after him, when the other watchmen joined him, and together they moved along towards their respective beats. As soon as they had left, the lieutenant of the watch rose to stop a loud clamor among the men detained in the male apartment. There was much loud swearing and shouting, and the confusion of a very respectable uproar. Taking a pistol and cocking it, he opened the door and called out in a loud, thundering tone, for silence. There was an instantaneous lull of the tempest. Some of the men, for there were six or seven in all, slunk to their berths, while the rest stood quiet and gazed upon him. `What an infernal noise,' he cried, in a stern voice. `If I hear any thing more like it, I will blow somebody's brains out! So mind your eyes there among you. Some of you devils, I see, have been hoping to get out; but I'll just publicly express my private opinion in a personal way to you, my dears, that there's no kind o' use trying on't! It's no use! You can't come it! Stronger men than any o' you mean looking scoundrels here, and more of 'em too, have tried the same game with a rush, but it didn't hang well—not a bit! They had to bite their thumbs, just as I adwise you to do, and go to bed. If I hear any more of sich a catawampus, I'll make some o' ye wish Dick Crabtree (that's my name, gentlemen) hadn't been born afore you was well dead. So now you've got my private 'pinion of the case, you know which side your bread is buttered.' With this brief and characteristic speech, Mr. Crabtree slammed the door too, dropped across it a very heavy iron bar, uncocked his pistol and hung it upon a peg by the side of it. `Captin' dear!' cried a sort of boatswain's voice with the asthma, through a crevice in the door leading to the women's lodge. `There's the women now. It's as much as a man's conscience is worth to keep such a place. What do you wan't in there?' `It's me. It's Bess!' `I don't thank you fur the information —you've been here till you're no stranger. What do you want, Bess?' he de manded, though not in such a gruff tone as he had at first pitched his voice.— And as he put the question, he unlocked the door. `I want a little whiskey, if you please, Captin'.' `Not a drop this night for love nor money. It's agen' the law, Bess!' `I don't want it for myself, Captin'. The woman is faintin' and I'm 'fraid she'll die.' `What woman?' `The slender, thin cove as come in last? Don't you see her layin' with her head on the beach? If you don't believe me, see with your own eyes.' `It's all a flam, got up between ye to get rum.' `I swear to jubilee it out, Crabtree! She's goin' off like a gaspin' fish.' `I'll see—I'll see! I knows sham from natur!' and the stout Captain forced his round, puncheon-like body through the much too small door and approached the fallow form of the poor woman whom David had brought in.— She was lying upon the floor, with her head upon the bench from which she had sunk down. She seemed to have fainted, for her eyes were half closed and glassy, and her face as white as marble. Near her stood the young girl who, as Bess was talking with the Captain had been very diligently, under color of aiding her, foraging in the pockets of the poor woman's dress for whatever she might be so fortunate as to find; but to her surprise and disappointment they contained absolutely nothing to reward her charitable activity. `You have done this, Bess,' said the lieutenant of the watch, as he saw that it was `natur' and no sham. `You've been fighting and knocked her down.' `As I have a soul to be saved—' `Doubted! You needn't swear it.— How was it, Juley, girl!' `I don't know I'm sure. It was all at once. We were talking, Ben and I, about William Wilson and his killing young Henry Temple, when all at once, when we wern't sayin' any thing to her, she kind o' gave a sigh, and down she went there just as you see her.' `That's the livin' truth, Crabtree, I'll take my oath on it,' asserted Bess, with round emphasis, and a rounder oath that cannot be here recorded. `I dare say she's half starved and grieved to death,' said the lieutenant with more sympathy than was promised from his previous exhibitions of character.— `I'll get some rum and we'll try to bring her to!' he added, going to the officer, and returning with a portly jug. He stooped down, and poured some into her mouth, while Bess and Juley bathed her head and hands, pouring some of the liquid into their palms, and then carrying the well-filled socket of the hand thrice to their own thristy lips, while they gave her head and hands the benefit of the rest. At length the poor woman revived, and looked around with a fearful and uncomprehending gaze. The burly figure of the captain of the watch, the vice-impressed countenances of the woman Bess and the young girl, brought at once the whole force of her condition to her mind. She groaned deeply, and murmured— `Oh, my poor children! What have I done so wicked as to bring me to this?' `Cheer up, marm, cheer up,' said Crabtree, with a disposition to assuage the miserable woman's grief. `I have seen worse cases than yours—you'll only be hauled up afore his honor in the mornin,' and perhaps at the outside, be sent up for sixty days.' `She's a mere green 'un, said Bess, with a toss of her head. `I never saw a woman have so little grit. I'm blessed if I ever felt so bad for being here, as I don't, if I'd let the officer see it, and expose myself so afore him. Come, be a man, or what is better, be a woman, and snap your fingers at them as I do.' Hereupon the amazon suited the action to the word, and caused Dick Crabtree to step back, to save a smart rap with the nimble ends of her fingers upon the cheek. `I'll have a pair of bracelets on your wrists, Bess, if you are not civil,' answered the captain, with an oath. I don't mean to have my dignity treated with despise by any o' your tramps. So keep quiet. You know me, Bess, and I know you.' Here he caused his staff to perform sundry evolutions above her head, at which she neither moved nor winked, while the girl Juley amused herself in making mock courtesies to the officer. `I'd like to have you both sent up for a year, for you are both of a piece!' he cried, with angry vexation. `They are enough to corrupt you, marm, and I'd advise you to have nothing to say to 'em. You seem to be a pretty decent body, and I dare say wont be in here again in a hurry.' `Indeed, sir, I was not aware that I was doing any thing to bring me into such a place!' said Mrs. Wilson, shuddering. `I feel I have done nothing, and I know the judge will acquit me.' `Well, that's his look out. Mine is to take care of such folks as is brought here till the judge sends for them. So good night, all. Bess, if I hear from you again, it shall be the last time. If they trouble you, marm, just sing out to me. That's all.' With this quiet menace, the Captain of the watch took up his lantern and left the lock-up, firmly securing the door as he shut it. Bess contented herself with shaking her huge masculine fisl after him —while Juley turned a pivouette, as if glad to get rid of his presence. `Now, we have the coast clear,' said Bess, walking with long strides up and down the apartment, with her arms akimbo. `If I had seven women like myself, I'd drive every watchman out of this watch-house, and keep the ground too, till I was killed or taken. Juley, it takes a woman for fightin'. But not such a mealy-faced thing as that ere one,' she added, pointing with her right elbow towards Mrs. Wilson. `It is sitch soft one's as that as destroys our sex, and makes the men think they can rule over us. Juley, you are young now, and many years maybe is afore ye. Let me give ye one piece o' advice, as will be o' use to you as long as you live.' `Well, Bess, what is it?' asked the young girl, stopping after one or two more whirls upon her toe a la Elssler. `Always hit first!' `I'll remember it, Bess,' answered her pupil, executing a pas that would have excited the envy of Taglioni. `Now, Juley, let's sit down, and talk with this ere woman, and see what she is,' and she instantly approached the poor woman. `I beg you will not disturb me, good people,' she said, shrinking. `I am not well.' `Send for the Doctor, Bess,' cried Juley, with unfeeling raillery. `Pra'ps, sheld like the parson best, seein' as she looks sert o' religious. Well, let her alone; for she'll up and yell, and then old Crabtree 'll be in here, and put the mittens on us. So let's be quiet. Put some wood into the stove, Juley, for its gettin' as cold here as a rich man's garret.' The order was obeyed and the two females drew near to the stove, and began to court its genial warmth. Mrs. Wilson would have gladly drawn nigher to it, for she was suffering, but she preferred to be chilly as she was, to being in the society of such depraved persons of her own sex; for their brutality and oaths shocked her modest, pure mind; for though poor she was virtuous and moral, and a stranger to the vices that, alas! too often are the attendants upon poverty. In a little while she sank into a sort of dreamy state, half sleep, half wakefulness, but a state of mental consciousness of suffering. The two females at the stove soon began to talk together, as if not heeding her or supposing her to be asleep, yet she heard every word they said, and when she heard her husband's name uttered, she was all ear and the keenest attention. They spoke low and cautiously, but as she was within five feet of them behind, she heard distinctly. `Then you think he will be hanged if he is taken, Bess!' `Yes, Juley; and nothin' on the roun' earth can save his neck.' `But he'll say he did it in defendin' himself,' said the young girl. `That won't help him. Don't you know in law-courts, the prisoner ant allowed to say nothin' for or agen himself. He ant bleived if he says he's guilty; and much more if he says he's innocent. Courts is curus things, gal, as you'll find when you've had as much 'sperience of om as this ere hoss!' `I'd like to find Wilson and get the three hundred that has been offered for him.' Here the poor woman started, but instantly recovered her appearance of sleep, and listened with the most painful intensity, to every word that followed. `Who wouldn't? But there's the difficulty. No body knows where he is; though Dick Nevers said yesterday he believed he was hid somewheres in the city. Well, that Henry Temple was a proper nice young man, though he had a good deal too much devil in him when he had the wine in. You know'd him, though, Juley.' `Didn't I? He gave me and two others a champaigne supper ony the night afore but one that he was killed.' `Was Ann Wilson among you?' asked the woman, taking out a short smoke burnt pipe from her deep bosom and filling it with tobacco from a tortoise shell box drawn from the same ample receptacle. `No, not that night; I never saw her but once.' `When was that?' `Out to the races at Cambridge? Harry had her in his phæton along side of him. She was veiled close all the time, except once the wind took her veil right up and blowed it over the top of her bonnet. My! how quick she got hold of it and pulled it down and looked as blushy as a red-herrin'.' `Was she as handsome as they say she is?' asked Bess, taking up a bright coal with the bowl of her pipe, and placing the short bit of stem in her mouth. `Yes, she was handsome and no mistake, Bess. But Temple seemed plaguey ashamed she was seen; for he meant no body should know but she was a tip-top lady he had with him.' `He might have knowed, rich as he was, no genteels would ride with him, he'd got to be so dissipated. I wonder where he hid her? It's the strangest thing neither she nor her father has been found since Harry's murder, and it's now most six weeks.' `I shouldn't wonder if she had been made way with, Bess.' `I shouldn't either. It's a pity if she has; for with her face she'd ha' made her fortin. I don't blame her father much for killin' him. It was nat'ral for a man who had his daughter seduced away by a rich young fellow that way, to want satisfaction.' `I don't think so, Bess. She was ony a poor sewing-girl, and he ought to have felt himself honored that sich a respectable young gentleman as Harry Temple noticed her at all.' `Well, Juley, I hopes they'll catch him, coz; I'd like to hear how it all came out on the trial. They do say as how the father of Ann Wilson was pecooliarly agawated to do what he did. Some say as how Harry passed himself off as a young journeyman printer, and so won her affections. Coz, she'd have been shy on him if he'd come in his kids and gold chains, and driven his buckish horse and baroosh up to her father's door.' `Yes, Harry was always cute. I heard he did something o' the kind.' `Well, if he did, he deserved what he got. I can't stand one o' your men under false colours. I like every thing fair and above board. Every one in his own skin, I say. If a man is a sinner let him swear! If a man is pious let him pray! But none of your cross handed fire for me. I never disguises myself; I'd scorn it. What I am all the world knows, and the devil too! I always act out my nat'ral character, and would be ashamed to pass myself off for a vartuous woman, when I knows I aint one. If Henry Temple come it over the father of Ann Wilson that way, as people say he did, he got his desarts, and the old man aint to blame! Still I hopes he'll be cotched, coz, as I told you afore I want to read the trial.' `Well, Bess, I'm sleepy,' ejaculated Miss Juley with a yawn. `So am I! so let's bunk. There's that pale-faced flummock as fast as a turnkey after dinner.' With these remarks the two ladies rose, and each finding an empty bunk got into it; and in a little while the lock-up was perfectly quiet. CHAPTER VII. THE POLICE COURT-ROOM. Early on the ensuing morning, just as the day began to dawn, the slumbers of the inmates of the lock-up were rudely broken by a loud voice at the grating of the door, calling out— `Turn up, turn out. Bear a hand and get rigged in less than no time to go to Court.' This command was instantly followed by a general movement in the apartment occupied by the female prisoners. As they had all turned in without removing an article of clothing, their toilet was soon arranged. Bess and her young protege grumbled a little at being called so early, and the former told the officer that she would not stir her stumps without a naggin of bitters. `You'll get your bitters, old 'un after you get to the p'lice-court,' said the officer with a laugh. `No stopping now for such things, Come, move on, for the carriage is waiting.' `Bless us! am I to be a lady and ride in my coach. Hear that, Juley.' We are ladies and they knows how to treat us,' answered the young girl, as she passed out. `Come, woman,' said the officer, looking at poor Mrs. Wilson, who after a restless night had awaked to the painful consciousness of her situation, and was now weeping violently at the thought of her family, and her own disgrace.— `Come, you must not stay here. `You will be like to get only sixty days on that matter, if it was only a shutter you stole.' These words were spoken by the officer in tones of kindness, as if he felt the woman was far from being depraved like the most of those who were placed there, and really deserved sympathy. Mrs. Wilson raised her head, and wiping away her tears advanced tremblingly, for she was really weak from hunger and sorrow, and went out into the office where all the other women were gathered with several watchmen about the stove, for the cold of the morning was intense. The old hacks at the door, drawn by wretched horses, received the captives of the night, and went off with them to the court of justice. Mrs. Wilson sat in one corner, covering her face with her hands, and paying no regard to the opprobrious epithets with which the others saw fit to notice her. At length they alighted at the court house and were ushered into the presence of the judge. It was past sunrise and he was then in the act of taking his seat. The cases of the prisoners who had accompanied Mrs. Wilson were soon disposed of, and sentences given. Her case was resumed last, as old Jarvey the miser, had not yet come to appear against her. At length he entered muffled to the eyes in furs and woolen comforters out of which his long peaked nose protruded with remarkable conspicuousness. The case was called and the old man entered his complaint charging her with stealing his shutter from the street with which the wind had blown it during the storm of the night before. `What have you to say, woman, to this charge of theft?' demanded the justice, sternly, eyeing the shrinking, trembling form before him. `Sir, I have nothing to say. If the gentleman says that it was stealing, I then have stolen; but sir,' she continued with touching earnestness; `but, sir, God above knows that I was innocent of any intention to steal from him, or from any other living person in the world! I and my family at our poor home were perishing for a fire both to warm us and to cook what little food we had left. I was the only one that could bear the storm and I went out to gather wood!' `Where did you expect to find wood, woman? It does not grow in the streets!' said the Justice, sternly. `No, sir! But I was in hopes the wind would have torn off some old shingles or bits of boards or broken a branch from some of the trees by the side-walks, so that I could bring home a little something!' `I dare say; and if you had not found any of these things, doubtless you were ready to tear off the shingles or boards and break off the branches if you thought you could do it safely. I have had enough of your quality here before now!' `Indeed, sir, I am no thief. I would not have taken a shingle new or old from any man's house. I hoped to find somewhat in the street. So I went along scarcely able to bear up against the wind and snow, and was near perishing and had almost resolved in my heart to go home again and die there rather than in the streets, when I saw before me half buried in the snow what I thought was a piece of board. I flew to get it, when I saw that it was an old shutter much broken and fit only for fire-wood!' `Fit only for fire-wood, hey?' repeated old Jarvey, making a step towards her and shaking his cane in her face. Impudent huzzy! Do you dare to say that my window shutters are fit only for fire-wood! You won't get off this way. Your honor, I hope that you see that she is a liar as well as a thief.' `You live in a very old house, I believe, Mr. Jarvey,' said a man who sat near the prisoners and towards whose benevolent face poor Mrs. Wilson's eyes had been more than once turned with an undefined feeling that he would not see her wronged if he had power there. `Yes, Mr 'Gustus, but that is nothing. You'll please let the justice go on, and not intermeddle here. This is a case that don't come under your province, so you will oblige me by keeping quiet. The woman is a thief! She stole my shutter! I followed her home! I saw her break it up and throw it in her fire! No matter if the shutter was not worth more than a sixpence, that sixpence worth I'll have justice for!' `That will do, Mr. Jarvey,' said the Justice. `I will pursue the examination myself. So, then Madam, you acknowledge that you stole the shutter?' `I did not steal it sir! I took it, not thinking it was good for any thing.' `Except to burn,' said the Justic with a slight sneer. `That is all, sir!' `And that is all wood is good for.' If you had gone to my wood-pile and stolen half a cord of wood, you might have offered the same plea with equal justice, that it was only fit to be burned! The shutter then being acknowledged by you to be fire-wood, has a value like other fire-wood! you are therefore guilty of theft!' `Good? There you have her, Mr. Justice, like a rat in a pair of tongs!' exclaimed the little miser rubbing his hands together partly from glee, and partly from cold, for the court room was something chilly. `But sir,' plead the poor woman who thought of her family and their wretchedness and the danger too that would befal one of them if she were sent to prison,' but sir, the shutter was in the street. I found it half buried in the snow!' `No excuse! Is what is found in the street the property of the finder's, answer me that?' `N—n—no, sir,' said the poor woman with hesitation, feeling her perfect helplessness under the subtle power of the law. `No, sir, if it is valuable like money.' `Or like wood!' responded the justice with a look of ironical triumph upon his face. `You see that you can't better the matter, woman. If a dozen sticks of wood had fallen from a cart, would you have been at liberty to pick them up and carry them home as your own?' `No, sir, but —' `But to pick up a shutter and carry it home and burn it, is a far greater offence. It is true the shutter had been blown from the building to which it appertained and lay in the street half-buried in the-snow. But this accident did not destroy the owner's property in the shutter. It was his still, and would have been his where ever he could have found and identified it. He saw you pick up the shutter!' `Yes, with my own eyes, and so did this honest watchman,' cried Jarvey, giving this appellation to David Dalton out of gratitude at his having consented to appear in the Court against her; but the reader has seen with what reluctance the kind hearted man had yielded to circumstances he could not control. David was present. He stood a little back from the box in which Mrs. Wilson stood to go through her examination before committal. He leaned upon the top of one of the seats, wrapped in his watch-coat, his arms folded across his breast, his tall, athletic form conspicuous, and overtowering the diminutive miser, who was a pace or two in advance of him, leaning upon his staff.— Directly in front of the miser was seated the benevolent looking man, who was closely and shrewdly watching the progress of events. Jarvey carefully evaded this person's calm, clear eye, and more than once shifted his position to avoid its penetrating glances. David also watched the progress of the examination with painful interest. He could not help hating the man who had compelled him to bear testimony to condemn the poor woman whose poverty should have opened every heart to compassionate her. The words of the miser drew all eyes upon David. He could not help colouring with shame at the idea that they would think he had voluntarily given his testimony or arrested the woman at first, for so slight an offence, if offence it could be called. Having done his duty in arresting and appearing against her, he now resolved to yield to the dictates of his honest nature. So when the Justice turned to him and said, `So; you are the watchman that caught her stealing the shutter!' he answered firmly, `I am the watchman, your honor, that arrested the poor woman; but if I had my own way, I would not have done it. But I had to do it, or lose my place, and I am not rich enough to lose it; so I thought I would arrest her and leave it to the humanity of this court to have her honestly discharged from custody!' `Honestly discharged! What! Did she not steal the shutter?' demanded the judge with a look of surprise. `Mr. Jarvey, did you not say this man saw her do it?' `Yes, I did, your honor,' answered Mr. Jarvey, his face glowing with indignation at the bold position which David had now taken; for he saw that he having performed his painful duty to the letter was beyond his power. `He can't deny it.' `I do not deny, your honor, that I saw the poor creature take the shutter and bear it off.' `And you did not follow her?' `Not till I came down stairs and compelled him to do so, yer honor,' yelled Jarvey in his cracked, squeaking voice. `I told him if he refused to pursue and arrest her, I would have him complained of and discharged!' `And you would have only done your duty, Mr. Jarvey,' said the justice. `It is well for you, watchman, that you obeyed him. You should have acted promptly at first. Your duty is to protect the property of citizens!' `I know it, your honor,' answered David firmly. `I have never been once complained of in the years I have been a watchman for neglect of duty. I have arrested more rogues than any other man in the corps, though I say it!' `I am aware of your good character, Dalton,' said the justice. `I am, therefore, surprised that you should wait until a citizen calls upon you, before you perform your duty. Nay, until that citizen threatens you.' `Your honor, I did not consider that my services were called for. It was a bleak, fierce night as ever I walked my beat in. The snow and wind were driving through the streets with terrible violence. As I was wrapped in my warm coat and partly sheltered, I was thinking of the sufferings of the poor at such a time, when I saw a dim-looking figure struggling along through the tempest. As it came nearer, I saw that it was a woman thinly clad. There lay in the street, half hidden by the snow, a fragrant of a window shutter which the wind had a few minutes before hurled from the shackly old building on the corner where I was standing.' `Shackly old building!' repeated the miser in a rage, and shaking his stick at David. `Why did you not pick it up?' asked the justice, paying no attention to the miser's angry vehemence. `Because, your honor, I did not regard it as of any value. I should not have thought of it again, but that I saw the woman run to it, draw it from the snow, and hurry off with it.' `And what did you say?' asked the justice. `I said in my heart, Go, poor woman. The wind has been God's angel to thee and thy cheerless hearth!' `Humph! And did you not think of following her?' continued the justice with a frown, for the noble sentiments of humanity are not always welcome in a halt of `Justice.' `I did, your honor, think of following her to place a little money in her hand to buy food and fuel, for I thought that one of her sex who was forced to go abroad on such a night to seek wind-drifts must be poor indeed. But she was gone before I could pursue her.' `You see this, your honor,' cried Jarvey. `You see that by his own confession he is her partner in the crime!' `It looks very like it, Dalton,' said the justice, compressing his lips and looking very severely. `It is well for you you went after her, even at Mr. Jarvey's threats; for you would not only have lost your place, but I tell you plainly I should have committed you. You have just saved yourself. A narrow escape.' `I think he ought to he committed as it is, your honor,' said Jarvey. `However, if I get the woman sent up for six months, (it ought to be State's prison for three years) I will let it pass. The city should employ watchmen that haven't soft places in their hearts.' `Mr. Jarvey,' said David, `I would rather have that soft place in my heart which led me to pity this poor woman, and be begging by the highway, than have that hard place in your heart and own the mines of Mexico!' `Silence,' said the justice, rapping upon the desk before him. `David Dalton, you testify that you arrested this woman in the act of breaking up and burning the shutter which you saw her steal out of the street soon after it fell from the house occupied by the plaintiff?' `I arrested her burning the old shutter I saw her take out of the snow in the street,' answered David, laying a strong emphasis upon the word `take' in contradiction to the term `steal.' CHAPTER VIII. THE SENTENCE AND THE RELEASE. The answer of the stout-hearted watchman did not by any means please his honor. He frowned and bit his lips. He had himself used the word `steal,' not `take,' and that the witness should thus substitute one word for another, was not gratifying to him. It is true that he had no right to have used the word `steal,' thus declaring a theft to have been committed, when his duty was only to decide upon the truth given in. But there are some justices who always assume that the prisoner brought before them is guilty, especially if they be poor and friendless. Such was the case in the present instance. It was clear to all present who were disinterested, that he would have been very much disappointed to find the prisoner guilty. He seemed to take delight in condemning. To acquit any one went sorely against his nature. Instead of regarding himself as a protector of the innocently accused, who might be brought before him, he no sooner confronted a prisoner than he assumed a frown to inspire terror and brow-beat. He did not now like the bold bearing of the honest watchman. If he had dared to have stretched his authority, he would forthwith have ordered a committal for him; but as David had faithfully, though reluctanctly, performed his duty, in arresting the woman, he could charge nothing against him. The Justice, after being a few moments silent, as if considering what he should do, for in his heart, he felt that the poor woman was no thief, and that her case called for commisseration rather than punishment, looked up uneasily at the benevolent-looking man and then fixing his eyes on the prisoner said sternly, `Prisoner, you have been accused of stealing a shuter, and the accusation has been fully proved. You have plead poverty and the valueless character of the article stolen. But neither of these pleas are admissible in a court of justice, as I trust this is. If poverty were an excuse for theft then no persons would be convicted; for want it is that leads to the commission of almost every theft. The man who steals a loaf of bread, though he were perishing with hunger, is equally guilty with the man who robs the vaults of a bank. Theft is theft. Ahem.—Nor is the plea that the thing stolen is of no value. It has a certain value to the thief, or why should it be coveted. The shutter may not have been worth to Mr. Jarvey a sixpence.' `Your honor, I would not take one silver dollar for it. It will cost me two dollars to have a new one made.' `Very well. You see, prisoner, that the value of your theft is two dollars: a very grievous crime, you perceive. But under the circumstances if you are willing to pay him the value of the shutter and the costs of your arrest, &amp;c., which will amount to about a `five,' you are at liberty to go to your home; otherwise I shall commit you for three months. An example must be set. Justice mnst not be too lenient. The dignity of the laws must be maintained.' `Oh, sir, I have no money,' cried the poor woman, clasping her thin hands together, and looking towards him with a tearful face. `I have not one penny in the world. I am wretchedly poor. I have a family at home who are at this moment perishing for food and warmth. Oh, sir, be merciful to me, as you hope to have mercy at the bar of God!' `Don't talk to me here, woman, of the bar of God! We recognise here only our own tribunal. You will gain nothing by sacrificed speeches and tears. We are used to that blarney here. Pay the five dollars, or Mr. Officer take her off to the House of Correction.' `Mercy! mercy!' cried the poor woman, shrinking from the officer's touch, throwing herself upon her knees before the inexorable justice. `Do not bar me from my children. I meant not to steal.' `Three months, woman. You have your sentence. Officer, do your duty?' `Stop, sir,' said David Dalton, stepping up, and extending one arm between her and the officer, while with the other he raised her from her knees. `There is no need to go to extremities in this affair. The poor woman has friends, though she can't find justice. Keep up courage, ma'am. They shan't harm yon. It was through me you came here, and I'll get you free, if five dollars will do it. Your honor,' he added, in a voice deep with generous emotion, and laying, as he spoke, five dollars upon the table, `there is the five paid. The poor woman is free from your clutches, God be thanked.' `What, fellow!' cried the justice with flushed cheeks, `do you contemn and insult this court?' `No, your honour!' answered David, standing erect in the dignified attitude of an honest man; `I mean to insult no man. What I said came from my heart and my lips would utter it. If you choose to commit me, I am ready as soon as I see this poor woman safe home!' `You have lost your berth as a watchman, fellow, if I have influence enough to eject you from it,' answered the enraged justice, his face looking even redder than its usual brandy hue. `My good man,' said the benevolent looking gentleman, rising and taking David's large hand in his own and smiling kindly, almost sweetly, upon him, `you need not fear any ill consequences from your generous and fear less conduct this morning. If his honor should succeed in getting you dismissed, though I do not see what charge he can bring against you, I will take care that you find employment. I have been watching your face during this examination. I was pleased to see the deep interest you take in the case of the poor woman, and I only delayed to advance the five dollars in her behalf, knowing from your manner that you would certainly do it, and I was willing that you should have the satisfaction of doing it.' `Sir, you are very kind. I would not have been prevented for a good deal from paying the money, poor as I am; for by my means she is here before this justice's court. If I had not have been so afraid of losing my place she would have escaped!' `Mr. Justice,' now cried out the little miser, who had been looking from one to the other and listening to what was said with his blood boiling over, `Mister Justice, I protest against this mode of settling the matter. I did not say I would take two dollars for the shutter. I only said it would cost that to have a new one! Two dollars won't satisfy me. It won't pay for my trouble last night, my trouble here this morning, and my wear and tear of mind and body, besides a three penny candle that burned all night in my entry because, in my excitement, I forgot to blow it out! Sir, I demand justice. I demand that the thief be sent to jail for at least six months!' `Mr. Jarvey,' said the justice, `the case being decided and the money paid, there is no reversion. You must submit as you best can. If you had made out a bill of damages you should have had full recompense, but as it is I can do no more in the matter.' `I will appeal to the criminal court!' cried the little man, taking up his hat and thrusting it down hard upon his head and stamping noisily and angrily strode out of the room. `Oh, sir, can he prosecute me farther?' cried poor Mrs. Wilson, who had been overwhelming David with her grateful thanks for what he had done for her. `No, madam,' answered the benevolent man, kindly taking her hand. You are now safe.' `Are you sure he can do nothing?' asked David, making a step as if he were about to pursue the miser. `If I thought he could I would follow him and give him a lesson that would make him repent any such intention as he has upon his mind.' `He can do nothing, my good man. The case is dismissed and can be prosecuted no farther.' `Hear that ma'am!' said David, with exultation. `I do indeed, sir!' she answered, with looks of grateful happiness that caused even her pale wan checks to wear, for the moment, an aspect of beauty. `Is there a coach at the door, David?' asked the gentleman, who had taken such an interest in the fate of the prisoner. `I will see, sir,' answered the generous watchman, hastening from the room, while the justice putting on his hat and cloak prepared to go home to his breakfast, having got through with the examinations of the night-captives. He had sentenced Bess to pay a fine of three dollars and to promise good behaviour, and had sent the young girl, Juley, to the House of Correction for sixty days. If he had sent the poor woman, Mrs. Wilson, up for the same time he would have gone home to his breakfast with a better appetite; but there was something in the countenance of the benevolent gentleman, who was closely watching the examination, which restrained him from following out the dictates of his bosom with reference to her. But for his presence he would have sent her up for six months. But his own judicial power feared before the moral power of that good man's, to carry itself fully out. Would that every court of justice had a human-angel watching closely the judges, and guarding the helpless and the innocent from the vigours of relentless justice and the wanton exercise of power. The proceedings in some of our courts would disgrace the judiciary of a Turkish court of justice. The common idea of justice is to make it the synonyme of punishment. Justice holds the shield as well as the sword; and should protect as well as chastise. Justice is no longer blind. It knows the rich from the poor when both stand before its tribunal! Its brow is ever bent into a frown instead of being expanded with benevolence and sympathy. Instead of presuming every one innocent till proved guilty, it presumes them guilty and fears, as it would seem, that they may be proved innocent. It seems to stand gaoler at the great prison-houses of the land and to cry `more, more! Give us more!' It delights to condemn rather than to acquit. It looks upon innocence as its foe! Such is `justice' in many of the petty courts of our great cities. Through them hundreds of incent persons have been condemned with the guilty. In one of the tribunals of one of the cities of this land, there stands, day and night, a man at the right hand of the judge whose self-imposed province it is to act as a mediator between the prisoner and the judge! Hundreds of the poor and the unfortunate, and friendless have been saved by his interpoition, and restored to society. His watchful eye scans closely the proceedings. His availing arm is stretched forth to save and defend. His presence is like that of angels there! Justice is purified by it, and more cautiously administered. Is not the very fact of this benevolent interposition a proof that justice needs to adorn itself with humanity as with a garment of righteousness. Does it not show to the world that more benevolence is needed in the administration of our tribunals. If humanity, charity, and love ruled over the decisions of the judges what need is there for a `Daysman' between the prisoners and the bench? Remember, oh, ye Judges! that misfortune is the legitimate mother of crime, and that pity and charity should ever temper the severity of justice! David now came in saying that the coach was ready. The gentleman then took Mrs. Wilson, poor and wretchedly clad as she was, by the hand and led her out of the low, dark court room, and assisting her into the coach, got in after her, while David got up with the driver to show him the way to her house, and at the same time to have the pleasure of seeing her once more restored to her home. The morning was bright and clear. The sunshine sparkled upon the surface of the snow and produced a brilliant effect, reflected from roofs, windows, cornices and trees. The street, early as it was, was filled with many sleighers, and musical with the jingling of bells. The hack in which they rode was upon runners, and glided swiftly and smoothly along the snowy streets. `I learn from the watchman, madam,' said the benevolent gentleman, whom we shall call Mr. Gustavus, addressing her to stop her expressions of joy and gratitude which to a true benevolent heart are annoying, `I learn that you are called Mrs. Wilson. From your appearance and your conduct in the court I am satisfied you are an honest person, and that you intended no crime.' `Indeed, sir, I did not. Do you, sir, think it was a crime, then?' `No, dear madam, not in God's eye. In the eye of human laws it is a crime to take the property of another wherever we may find it. There was no guilt in taking the shutter from the street, for I know you would not have torn it from the window had you seen it hanging by one hinge only, and ready to fall.' `No, indeed, sir, I would not,' she answered earnestly. `Well, we won't speak of it any more. It is all over, and you are safe from the perils to which it has exposed you.' `And through your goodness, sir, and that of the good watchman. Sir, you have both done an act that I cannot reward you for, but God will reward you.' `I am content for all that I have done or may do for you to await that reward,' answered Mr. Gustavus with a smile. `You live, you say, in a small court out of Flagg Alley?' `Yes, sir.' `We shall hardly be able to get near your abode in the coach. We will stop at the foot of the alley. Are you married?' The woman hesitated, looked embarrassed, but not guiltily so, and then answered hurriedly, `Yes, sir.' `Have you children?' `Two—three, sir!' `You have represented yourself as very poor. Is your husband not able to maintain you?' he asked, without appearing to notice her confused answer. `Yes—yes, sir!' she answered, in the same embarrassed manner. `Perhaps he is ill?' `No, sir. That is—' `Well, I will not pry too closely into your domestic affairs. I am convinced you are an honest woman. I wish to go to your house to see how you live and how I can improve your situation; for it will never do for one so feeble as you are to be forced abroad in a stormy night after drift wood to keep your family from perishing. But the coach is now at the foot of the alley. We will alight here.' CHAPTER IX. THE SECRET DISGUISED. The party alighted at the part of the alley, David opening the door, and assisting the poor woman to get out.— Never had poverty two stauncher friends than had this helpless female in this her hour of misfortune. Mr. Gustavus offered her his arm, while David went forward leading the way, and kindly and carefully beating aside the snow with his boots, that she might walk easier; for the narrow passage through which they were passing was very much blocked up, and she was as fragile as a willow rudely blasted by the storm. `Indeed, sir,' said Mrs. Wilson to her benefactor, `you need not take so much trouble. You have done more for me than I could hope for. I can never repay your kindness. Besides, my house is too wretched for a gentleman like you to enter it. `I nevor yet, dear Madam, saw poverty so low that charity could not stoop as low. You have greatly interested me in yourself and your circumstances. I wish to see how you live, that I may know how to aid you. You must let me do as I wish in this matter,' he added smiling; `for I assure you I am very stubborn in such cases as this!' David now turned out of the alley into a narrower passage up which the house stood. As he went along, he saw the marks made by the shutter, as she dragged it through the snow the night previous. He silently pointed it out to Mr. Gustavus, who perfectly comprehended him. `Here is your house, ma'am,' said David, `and I trust after this, now that you have found so good a friend as Mr. Gustavus here, you will enjoy more happy days in it, than you seem to have done!' `God, I see, has raised me up friends,' she answered warmly, with tears sparkling in her eyes. `How shall I ever repay you, sir.' `Don't think of me. Five dollars is nothing compared with your staying six months in prison. I should not have slept or eaten in peace had you gone there; for I was a coward in letting old Jarvey's threats make me act against my conscience. It would have been better, ma'am, for me to have lost my place and trusted to Providence, than to have taken you up and had you sent to prison for no crime at all. Good morning, ma'am; I must go home and look after my little ones, for they'll not know what has become of me, for I'm in usually by day light.' `David, where is your house?' asked Mr. Gustavus. `In a little court that runs out of Cambridge street, sir!' answered the watchman. `What court?' `It is called Finney Place, sir!' `I know it. I will not forget you. Your good conduct to this poor woman has made me esteem you. Here is the five dollars again that you have paid for her. You cannot afford to lose it!' `I cannot afford to take it, sir! I am poor, that I know, sir! But I am richer without that money than I should be with it! I paid it from my hear.! Keep it, sir! Will you not let any one have the pleasure of doing good but yourself?' `Then I will not urge you. I know the gratification that fills the soul from a generous action. I will not deprive you of this high enjoyment. It is possible, Mr. Dalton, that the Justice and Mr. Jarvey, by their combined influence, for I see that both are your enemies, may succeed in getting you dismissed from your station as a watchman. If so, do not fear but that you will find some other employment. This I will see to myself. Good morning!' `Good morning, sir!' `Take the silver and pay the coachman as you go out, and dismiss him!' David now took his leave of them, and Mr. Gustavus followed the poor woman up the tottering steps that led to the door of her dwelling. She looked as if something was on her mind aside from the present events. She appeared perplexed and trembled and several times looked at her benefactor before she opened the door, with an expression in which the deepest gratitude seemed to be struggling with a reluctance to admit him into the house. He saw this, but being resolved to do her good, he did not seem to regard it. He supposed that she had some secret domestic grief that she wished to keep from him; perhaps, an intemperate husband, or, as he strongly suspected was deserted by her husband and wished to keep his conduct from his knowledge. `Sir, I would rather you would not take the trouble to enter my cheerless abode,' she said, as she laid her hand upon the latch. `Pardon me, but I wish to know all, so that I can do you all the good you need,' he said, kindly, but firmly. `If you have any thing you wish to keep secret do not divulge it; for I do not desire to know what you may wish to keep back. I only wish to learn sufficiently to be of real service to you; for from what I can understand you are wholly without friends, and are suffering for the very necessaries of life.' `Sir, I will not say any more! I may yet confide in you wholly; for I see that I can have from you nothing to fear.' She then opened the door, which led into a small entry, from which a second door opened into the room occupied by the family. She had no sooner touched the latch of the outer door than the inner door was opened by the lad we have already seen. Upon seeing his mother, his large, lustrous, half-sunken eyes blazed with joy and he cried out, `Mother! dear mother!' and sprang into her arms. `Mother!' repeated the daughter Anny bounding to meet her. `Oh, has mother returned?' But as she saw behind her mother, the face of the stranger, she checked her bound of joy and stood gazing upon him with looks first of fear and then of confidence. She saw that he was not an officer—not an enemy, but a friend. Benevolence, peace, and kindness were engraven in heavenly lines upon his countenance.— She bounded forward without fear, and clasped her mother about the neck and wept in her bosom. For a few moments the three remained thus intertwined in one another's embrace, their hearts throbbing with tumultuous joy. `Oh, my dearest mother, how happy we are,' said the boy, lifting his dark, expressive eyes to her pale face which was fondly bent over him with natural love in every lineament. `Sister was just going to ask the judge to forgive you, and tell him all about it, how you didn't mean to do naughty, when you took that shutter that made us all so warm!' `Oh, mother, how is it that you are restored to us again?' asked the young girl, raising her pale, beautiful face all bathed with tears and beaming with happiness. `Through God's mercy in sending me two friends in my extremity, my child! Knee, both of you, and bless this gentleman; and I would that the generous and noble watchman were here also.' `And so do I, madam, that he might have witnessed this joyful meeting as I have done.' `I have witnessed it, sir,' answered the husky and tremulous voice of David close at his back. `I would not have missed it for another five dollars, sir! I came back to ask you if I had not better step in the market, and get a little something for them to eat, and a few bundles of firewood just to begin upon, for from what I saw last night they have not enough in their larder for a kitten's luncheon, and as to firewood, the old shutter must be pretty well used up by this time.' `You are right, David. Here is money. Use it at your discretion. You will know what to buy.' `Yes, sir; poor men can buy best for the poor,' answered David, taking the five dollar note and hastening from the house, his eyes filled with tears at the scene which he had witnessed. Anny, the lovely lame girl, would have knelt with her wasted brother at the feet of the stranger; but he raised them up and taking a chair—a broken one which he had to keep on its feet by the aid of his own,—he placed the boy upon his knee and kissing his pale brow, spoke to him in words of kindness and sympathy. Anny stood near clasping her mother's hand, and regarded the gentleman with looks of mingled curi osity and surprise. Kindness and sympathy were very strange things to her. `Now, dear madam,' said Mr. Gustavus after glancing around the almost naked room and seeing that the family was in the lowest poverty, `I beg of you to tell me exactly your situation.— I am your friend, and will do all I can to relieve you.' `Oh, sir, you are so good,' exclaimed the mother with emotion. `Have you any fire wood at all?' he asked, addressing Anny, upon whose lovely countenance he gazed with the deepest interest, wondering how it was that so sweet a flower should ever have unfolded itself in so uncongenial a soil. `We have only this fragment, sir,' she answered, blushing deeply as she pointed to a piece of the shutter; `we did not burn it after they took mother away, because we feared it would be wrong.' `And so you have remained in the cold.' `We went to bed and cuddled under the old quilt, sir,' said the boy. `It kept us pretty warm, all but my back.' `Poor child. You look almost frozen now. In a few minutes the good watchman will be here with wood.— Have you got anything to eat in your house?' `No, sir,' answered Anny. `Madam,' said Mr. Gustavus, turning to the poor woman. `I see you are in need of every thing. I will do what I can for you, but I should be glad to have your confidence fully. You told me that you had a husband. Where is he?' At this question Mrs. Wilson started and looked distressed; while the face of Anny and of the boy betrayed alarm and agitation. Mr. Gustavus felt his hand tremble in his own; and he could not but see that he had touched a painful chord. There was evidently some mystery—some painful fact which related to the unseen husband. He was not disposed to be inquisitive merely from idle ouriosity. He felt that this poor family had some secret source of sorrow even greater than its poverty, if it were possible. He felt a benevolent desire to arrive at the knowledge of it that he might alleviate it by his advice, or by pecuniary aid. `My dear good woman,' he said in a voice of kind persuasion, `I can hardly assist you as I would wish, unless I know the sources of your destitution. Be assured you can confide in me without fear.' `Mother, let us tell the good gentleman all about it,' said the boy earnestly. `I know he is a friend to you and us.' `Yes, mother, said Anny, with a face brightening with trustfulness, `we can trust this benevolent man. I know he will never betray us. His advice may do us good.' `But we should involve him in the responsibility of our secret, Anny,' answered Mrs. Wilson. `He would feel it a duty to inform, whence we feel it a duty equally sacred to conceal.' `I will put an end to the difficulty at once, dear wife,' said a voice behind them. It was the voice of a man; but Mr. Gustavus, on looking round, to his surprise, beheld a tall woman, or at least a person in a gown, shawl and hood. Mrs. Wilson uttered a cry of fear, and ran to him, while Anny and the boy both exclaimed `father,' with looks of surprise and terror. `Do not fear, children. Do not fear, Mary,' said the disguised man; `only keep the door fast while I am in here. This gentleman I know well by sight, and by reputation. I would trust him, as I am about to do, with my life. It is Mr Gustavus the friend of the unfortunate. I overheard his voice, and knew it, and peeping from my hiding place, saw him. I heard all that was said, and made up my mind that it was best to make a confidant of one who, if he could not aid us, would never betray us. Mr. Gustavus, though you see me appear dressed as a female, I am the husband of this woman.' `Who are you, sir, and what circumstances have rendered it necessary that you should thus conceal yourself in such disguise?' asked Mr. Gustavus looking at first at him, and then at the displaced boards through which he had entered the room. `My name, Mr. Gustuvus, when you hear it will perhaas make you start with feelings of revulsion; but before you condemn me, know my defence.' `I will hear you and judge impartially,' answered Mr. Gustavus with surprise, and wondering what revelation was about to be made. There was something in the tones of the man's voice and in his countenance that prepossessed him in his favor. `You have not forgotten the death of young Temple?' said the man, still wrapped in his hood and shawl, and furtively watching the door lest any one should enter. `No, sir, I have not.' `You have heard the name of William Wilson as the person who killed him?' `Yes.' `That is my name! I am the man, Mr. Gustavus!' said the disguised father and husband in a firm tone. `You! Are you the murderer?' cried Mr. Gustavus with surprise and almost with horror. `I was prepared for some painful revelation, but not for the bold confession of a murder!' `Mr. Gustavus, I have made this confession not boldly, but from a desire to let at least one important person know the whole truth. I feel that you will be my friend as you seem to be that of my family; and indeed, the friend of the friendless everywhere. You are the only man living that I would have appeared before, as I now do, and acknowledge myself to be William Wilson—the man hunted by the police, who are inspired to almost superhuman exertions by the large reward that is offered for my arrest. Will you listen to me while I relate the circumstances which led to that deed?' `I will; and the more willingly, as I begin to believe from your appearance and manner that you will be able to show some mitigating circumstances that will lessen the horror of the act.' `I trust I shall do so sir,' answered the man as he seated himself upon the low truckle-bed, his wife taking a seat by his side, and closely watching with alternate glances, the face of her husband and that of her listener. Charles still sat confidingly on the knee of Mr. Gustavus; while Anny stood near the window, her countenance expressing the deep interest she felt in what was to follow. CHAPTER X. THE STORY OF WILLIAM WILSON. As William Wilson was about to begin making his revelation to Mr. Gustavus, a heavy step was heard without the door. Anny looked through the dusky glass and exclaimed, `A man, father! a stranger! Hide quickly!' Mr. Gustavus rose to hasten to the door to see who it was, while the disguised Wilson concealed himself. His wife stood trembling and anxious till the opening of the door showed in the entry the tall form and honest countenance of David Dalton. Instantly the expression of alarm changed to one of joy and gratitude. Still, she was glad William had got out of the way; for she did not like to have his secret known to another, however good that other might be. David was laden down. In one hand he held a large basket in which, upon half a bushel of potatoes, were placed three nice fish, a pieca of fresh veal, and a large turkey with sundry little brown paper parcels. Over his shoulder was slung a bam and a large sack of wood and charcoal. His face fairly shone with benevolence and joy. `I am here, you see, sir,' said he to Mr. Gustavus. `I hope I have got what is needed. The turkey will do cold for two or three meals, and the ham is a good stand-by in a poor man's house. Here, ma'am, is a pound of coffee and a half pound of tea, four pounds of sugar, and a pound of butter, besides four loaves of fresh bread. You have got enough to last you in plenty for a week. I have brought you back, sir, two dollars and twenty three cents out of the five you gave me! There, me'am!' added David, setting down his basket and then laying from his shoulder the sack of wood and charcoal and the ham. `There, ma'am, you have prosperity under your roof again, thank God and Mr. Gustavus. I see your fire is out, and I'll just take the liberty to kindle one up and put the pot on to boil.' `Oh, sir, you have been too kind already,' said Mrs. Wilson hardly, able to articulate her thanks she was so overcome at the shower of blessings that were falling upon her. `Anny will do all—she is very handy and active.' `But I would rather, ma'am. Your daughter looks weakly.' `Yet I am stronger than you think,' answered Anny pleasantly, and hastening to gather from the dry wood enough to set the fire agoing. `Well, I'll let you do it, Miss. I dare say you will be happier doing it. I must'nt forget my own family in looking after yours, ma'am, so I'll go home. I saw a neighbour in the market who'll tell my wife not to be alarmed. I'll call to-night as I go on my beat to see how you all do. Food and fire will do wonders in a day.' `David Dalton shall be a confidant in my confession and defence, also, for there is not a truer man in Boston. David, remain awhile and hear what I have to say.' At these words, spoken so suddenly, David started and turned round. Upon beholding a tall female figure just, emerging from the opening in the planks, he looked amazed, and more especially as the voice was that of a man. `What can this be?' he exclaimed. Mrs. Wilson looked terrified; but Anny said, in an earnest tone and with a smile, `Dear mother, do you fear? He will never betray him!' `Him? Who is it?' cried David, looking at William as he advanced towards the fire-place, after first securing the door. `It is me, David Dalton! You knew me in better days!' As he spoke he threw back his hood entirely from his head and revealed a manly but haggard countenance. He seemed to have suffered immensely from hunger and anxiety. His visage was so ghastly that Mr. Gustavus, who had not before seen it fully revealed, uttered an exclamation of the deepest commisseration. David did not recognise him. `Have I then so altered, David?' `I do not know you. You are a man but in woman's gear. Yet I think I have seen those eyes before.' `I am William Wilson!' `Wilson, the murderer?' repeated David, with a step or two back; and with looks strongly expressive of his horror. `Yes, and the William Wilson you once knew. `The carpenter?' asked David, still standing aloof. `Yes.' `And are you the same William Wilson that killed young Henry Temple?' `I killed him!' David stepped back a pace or two farther, and regarded him a moment in silence. Mrs. Wilson feared he would betray him. It was a moment of intense anxiety to all. At length David said: `I have often wondered if the William Wilson who did that deed, was the same person who served his time as apprentice under the same master with me—I am sorry to find that he is! You bid fair to turn out better, So, then, ma'm, this is your husband?' `Yes, sir; but oh! for my sake—' `I shall not add to your wretchedness by informing upon him. It is sorrow enough to have, in addition to your poverty, a husband who is pursued by justice for so great a crime. I don't wonder you have been driven to poverty. I wish you had been happier than I see you are!' `David Dalton,' said the husband, `I may seem, in your eyes, to be a very guilty man! It is an awful thing for a man to slay his fellow-man; but he who kills another is not always guilty of murder. I wish you to hear my defence. I was about to begin it to Mr. Gustavus when you came in. He has kindly promised to hear me impartially.' `And so will I, William!' answered David, less severely than he had hitherto spoken. `Whatever may be said by you, I shall turn it to no harm. I will listen, also—for I should like to have you acquit yourself so far as you can. Ma'm, I wish you would tell me first one thing?' `Well, sir, will you please say what it is you wish?' `Was not the old woman I saw here last night your mother?' `Yes, sir.' `That is all I wanted to know. I can now account for her sudden disappearance when I entered—I see through it all now!' `Mr. Wilson,' said Mr. Gustavus, `proceed now with what you desire to make known. We are friends to you and yours, and be assured that whatever can be done for you shall not be withheld.' `Thanks, sir—thanks for myself and my poor wife and children!' answered William. `You shall now learn all the circumstances connected with the death of the young man for which I am now hunted by the laws. I need not inform you, sir,' said William Wilson, addressing himself chiefly to Mr. Gustavus, though glancing often towards David also,—`I need not inform either of you that Henry Temple was a young man who, at the age of twenty-one, came into the possession of a fortune of seventy thousand dollars. His parents had died when he was yet young, and he had grown up with little or no control, and in the free indulgence of his passions and pride. After he came into the possession of his money, you are aware that he commenced a course of extravagant licentiousness;—this the newspapers have proclaimed to the world.' `Yes, I am aware of all this,' answered Mr. Gustavus. `Proceed.' `One of the first steps which he took was to take a splendid suite of apartments in a fashionable quarter of the city, and gather around him that class of young men to be found in all large cities, who are willing to merge their own independence in slavish submission to the whims and arrogant pretensions of a young man with money. The career he ran with these is also well known. His extravagant dinners and suppers, his expensive equipages, his gaming saloon—these are but lesser features of his pastime. United to his love of display and reckless expenditure of his money, was the low passion of debauchery; to gratify which he left no means untried—regarded no expense, however enormous. No sooner would his lustful eye fall upon the fair face of an innocent, unprotected girl, than he would set to work with the subtlety and guile of Satan when he plutted the seduction of Eve, to compass her rein. I need not say that I am repeating facts well known to the world, sir.' `The character of Henry Temple has been made familiar to the public since his sudden death; still this cannot excuse the crime. It is no defence to say that the man you have killed was a bad man!' `True, sir; but I shall show to you that it was the wickedness of Henry Temple that brought his death upon him, though by my hand! After he had accomplished by fiendish arts the ruin of three young girls, who are now living a life of infamy, his baleful eye fell upon a lovely and innocent maid, as she was passing homeward from the shop where she worked as a milliner's apprentice. `Anny, dear,' said William Wilson, addressing the young lame girl his daughter; `perhaps you had better go and try to borrow a tea-kettle of Mrs. Traney in the house down the alley.' `No, father! I know all you would tell Mr. Gustavus and Mr. Dalton,' answered the interesting girl with downcast eyes. `I can bear all! I prefer remaining that I may listen to your vindication. I will cook the breakfast; so do not heed me!' `You are a good girl and a blessing to any father. As I was saying, sir, Temple's glance fell upon the modest girl I have spoken of. She was extremely beautiful, and as modest and discreet as she was handsome. Her modesty tempted him to endeavor to effect her ruin. He followed her home secretly and found out by the poverty of her abode that she was a poor girl. This was in his favor; but the humble station to which he saw she belonged, he had experience enough to know would be a bar to his success if he pressed his attentions upon her in his true character and under his own name. Her face showed she was too pure and good to listen to one who could only seek to ruin her; and convinced him that it would be impossible to make her acquaintance as Henry Temple. Besides, too, he found cut that she had a father who might not like to see a gay young man of the town prowling about his lowly sheep-fold.' `That father, William Wilson, was? —' `Myself, Mr. Gustavus.' `And that maiden, thy daughter?' `Yes, sir! But not this one! for I see your eyes are turned upon my poor and innocent child there. No sirs, it was her twin sister. Once as pure and innocent as—as she. Forgive me, sir, I can't but shed a few tears. It is a painful subject sir, for me to speak of, but you must know all.' `I am deeply interested, Mr. Wilson,' answered Mr. Gustavus pressing his hand. `And so am I, William,' said David Dalton. `I think I am beginning to see how it will come out.' `When you have heard all, judge me, gentlemen, answered William firmly. I will bring my story to an end as briefly as I can in justice to myself and my conduct. Henry Temple having seen my daughter and resolved to seek her ruin proceeded in this manner. He found a poor shoe-maker who kept a small boot shop in Hanover street, and at the same time worked on his bench with two apprentices in the back shop Money can accomplish anything. He went o this man, whom he knew to be simple and honest, and told him he was a young man without any trade and some money; and wished to marry a young lady whose father objected to the match because he had no trade wherewith to support her in case of a reverse of fortune. Now,' said Temple to him `I want you to assist me in this affair. I will purchase your stock-in trade, and hire you as my head workman. I will pay you double the price of everything. All I want is a shop, and for my intended father-in-law to see me at work in its for I shall work an hour or so, just so I can say it is my trade.' `How did you learn so much?' asked Mr. Gustavus. `From the shoemaker's own lips, sir. But you shall hear all. The shoemaker at once consented to the arrangement, pledging himself to secrecy, and Henry Temple at once installed himself into the shop as a boot and shoe-maker and seller. He assumed the name of Edward Carter which he put over the door. He dressed according to his trade in plain clothes, appearing at the shop in the forenoon for three or four days very regularly. You will now see, sir, the object of all this. The millinary establishment in which my daughter industriously worked, was only two doors from the shop which Temple occupied, and which he had chosen from its neighborhood to my child. He always made it a point to stand in the door when she passed and repassed at her meals so as to attract her attention. On the second day he even went into the shop where the worked to make some purchases. On the third day she passed his door, when he hastened after her with an elegant cambric handkerchief, saying politely, `Miss you have dropped this.'— She looked up and saw that it was the handsome young boot-dealer, whose attentive glances and manner had not passed unnoticed by her, and doubtless awakened some interest in her bosom towards one who appeared to be pleased with her. But to this moment they had never spoken. Would to God, it had been the last. She answered him modestly that he was mistaken, that the handkerchief was not hers, and thanking him for his politeness, she walked on: but he followed her saying. `It must be yours if your name is Ann Wilson, as I believe it is.' `It is my name, sir, but the handkerchief is not mine,' she answered. `Here is your name upon it, Miss,' he said, exhibiting her name before her eyes upon one corner of the laced handkerchief. She was struck with surprise, but answered as before, that it was not her's, but probably belonged to some other person of the same name. In vain he urged her to take it—she firmly refused, and he left her. As she returned from dinner he was standing in his door—the handkerchief was in his hand. He stepped out and said to her politely, `Miss Wilson, I can find no other owner of this than yourself. Keep it, at least, till an owner is heard from—mine it is not. If you refuse it, when your name is upon it, I shall cast it into the street.' `Well,' answered my daughter with a smile, `I will take it and keep it for the owner, though it is not mine, as you think.'—Fatal consent!' added Wilson, with a sigh. CHAPTER XI. THE BRIDEGROOM AND BRIDE. Mr. Gustavus had listened thus far to William Wilson's narrative with the most absorbing interest; and he now only interrupted him to inquire how he had learned such minute particulars of what passed between his daughter and the young pseudo boot-dealer. `From her own lips, sir,' answered he. `After all was lost, she made a full confession to me. The acceptance by her of the laced handkerchief was the first step to an acquaintance with her which ultimately ledto her ruin.— When a young lady suffers a young man, a stranger, to speak with her once, it is difficult to break off further aquaintance. When she came home, she exhibited before her mother and myself the handkerchief, and told how it came into her possession; at the same time speaking in such terms of praise of the politeness of the young boot-dealer, that I saw she was pleased with him. That he was other than he seemed, or that he had prepared this handkerchief with her name upon it on purpose to open an acquaintance with her, I never suspected until afterwards. `The next evening, as she passed his shop to come home, he came out and joined her with some words about his being still unable to hear of any other person bearing her name; and telling her that he was satisfied the handkerchief was hers, but she had capriciously refused to have it back from him after he had found it. Thus they talked about it, he playfully accusing her, and she as playfully defending herself. He escorted her to the door, and then asked permission to call and walk with her to church the next evening, which was a Sabbath evening. Ann said that he was a stranger to her, and she would rather wait till they were better acquainted.— He then bade her good evening. When she came into the house, she told us all that had passed, and I saw from her manner that she was more and more pleased with the young man. I, therefore, resolved to ascertain something about him, and the next day went into his boot-shop. I found the old man there, who gave me such a good account of him and of his business that I felt a secret desire that he might yet address Ann and marry her; for it struck me that it would be a good match for her. I, therefore, told Ann if he came home with her again to let me know it at the door, and I would step out and ask him plainly what his intentions were. The next evening he accompanied her home, and she came in while we were at supper, saying that he had done so; but had left her at the entrance of the alley. The next night he came with her to the door, and she invited him in?' `Did your daughter know your resolution respecting the young man, that it was your purpose to ask him what his intentions were?' asked Mr. Gustavus. `No, sir. She did not suspect my object. She had not any idea that I looked forward to a probable marriage. She would never have asked him in or permitted me to put such questions to him. When he came in and she introduced him, I was pleased with his appearance, and so was my wife. He made himself very agreeable to us all; seemed to be very intelligent and modest, and to show a very tender respect to Anny, my other daughter here, who you see is lame, poor child! He spent the evening with us. He told us his father was a farmer in Vermont, that he had recently came to the city with three thousand dollars to go into business, and liked very much. His name he told us was Edward Carter. `That night my wife and I lay and talked over the probable marriage of this young man with our child; for we saw that she was quite as much attached to him as he seemed to be to her. We congratulated ourselves upon his fine prospects in the world; and even in anticipation looked forward to seeing the old farmer, his father, down at the wedding. `The intimacy between my daughter and this young man continued for a week or ten days, each evening he accompanying her home and passing an hour or two with us. Sometimes she would walk out with him to a confectionaries, and once he went to church with her. We found that her heart was wholly wrapped up in him, and that he seemed to think of nothing but her.— Still he did not propose to her, and I began to wonder at it, for he was evidently in circumstances to marry at once, and he seemed so much in love with our child that it did not appear that he would be willing long to delay the marriage. Still, to all my questioning, she answered that he had not yet formally proposed, though indirectly hinted at marriage; and once laughingly asked how her father would like a boot-maker for his son-in-law. `One Sunday forenoon, two weeks after her first acquaintance with him, I and Mrs. Wilson were walking to church, for we used to be in better circumstances, then, and could be clad decently, sir,—as we were walking to church with Ann and her brother Charles before us, I saw a handsome phœton with two horses, dashing past, driven by a young gentleman dressed in the height of Fashion. My wife and I at the same instant exclaimed, “What a resemblance to Mrs. Carter!” We saw from Ann's face that she had also seen him, and was struck with the wonderful likeness.' `I should have believed that was him, Ann,' said Mr. Wilson, were it possible. But it couldn't be.' `That was young Harry Temple,' said a neighbor who was walking on before us. `He drives in fine style for a Sunday.' `Well, I declare,' said my wife `I never saw such a likeness. Ann, wan't you struck with it?' she asked, addressing my daughter. `Yes, mother,' continued Ann, who had not yet recovered from her confusion at the sudden surprise of seeing a face so like her lover's. But that it could be Harry Carter neither of us believed for a moment. He was dressed differently, drove an elegant equipage, broke the Sabbath, (and Edward Carter had represented himself as a member of the church,) and we had been told, moreover, that it was young Temple, whose name for his extravagancies and debaucheries was in everybody's month.' `The same evening the young boot-dealer arrived at the house to ask Ann to walk out to an evening meeting. My wife told him laughingly how we had almost believed we had seen him driving out in a splended phæton with dashing horses, and rallied him upon his likeness to the young roue Temple.' `And how did this affect him?' asked Mr. Gustavus. `He changed countenance and colored, and then answered, “I do not feel it to be a compliment at all!” seemed a little confused for some minutes, but suspecting no wrong, we referred it to his mortification at being thought to look as much like a young man whose character for vice was so notorious. He went out with Ann, and I sat up till their return, resolved if he did not speak to Ann about marrying her, that night, I would open the subject to him. But he left her at the door, and when my daughter entered I saw from her happy looks that something unusual had happened.— Upon questioning her, she told me that she had accepted if her parents gave permission. This intelligence was highly gratifying to us, sir, for we were assured that the match was one every way advantageous for our child. Anna's happiness was reflected from our own hearts. The next day I went to the boot-store to talk with him. He was not there, for it only suited his purposes to be there when he could see Ann passing, so that he could see her and walk with her home. But I found the old man there who spoke so highly of his employer that I was more pleas ed than ever with my daughter's good fortune.' `Do you think that the old man was also deceived respecting him?' asked Mr. Gustavus. `Yes. He very naturally spoke highly in praise of a young man who had bought and paid cash for his stock of goods, and seemed to be so well off and agreeable in his manners. He did not, till afternoon, make known to me the fact that he had been requested to keep secret, that he was merely learning the business to please a man whose daughter he was engaged to. This the old man kept from me; but what he told me otherwise respecting him, he firmly believed himself. `The same evening I was formally waited on by the young man, and a proposal was made to me for my daughter's hand. As I had no objection to offer, I gave my consent; and as he desired that the wedding should take place the next week, as soon as the “publishment” was out, which would be two weeks. I consented to this, provided Ann was willing. I found her nothing loth, and the next day their names were handed by me to the clerk's office for record according to law.' `He gave his name, you say, as Edward Carter?' asked Mr. Gustavus, pointedly. `Yes, sir. You will find it on the records now so written,' answered William Wilson with emphasis. `Every preparation was now made for the marriage. We saw the young man every evening and were more and more pleased with him; for he had great powers of entertaining when he chose to exert them; and he had now a prospect before him—the ruin of my child—of sufficient importance to lead him to make himself agreeable. The day of the marriage came. At his request the marriage was to be privately performed before only my family and a neighbor's, whose daughter was about Ann's age, was to be brides maid. A young man, whom Temple introduced as a leather-dealer, was his groomsman. He also was to bring the clergyman, who, he said, was the pastor of the church in Vermont where he lived, and whom by great good fortune he had found in the city. `The marriage, if such can be called the infernal mockery that was put upon me and mine, took place. I and my wife thought ourselves the happiest of parents, as we embraced our daughter as a bride. How shall I go on, Mr. Gustavus?' said William Wilson with strong emotion; while the sobs of his wife were audibly heard. But I will let you know all; for there is no shame to us. The day after the marriage, Temple proposed, as he said to take his wife on a visit to Vermont. They were to leave the same afternoon, and after dinner a coach came for them.— We bade them a tearful good-bye, hoping to see them again in three weeks, when he promised to return. `Now, sir, comes the most painful part of my narrative. Three days after the marriage, and when we were expecting that our child and her husband had about reached his fathers, I thought I would call in at his shop to see how things went. I found the old man there with a stranger, and to my amazement I was told that Mr. Carter had sold out the day after he married, and had no further interest there. The sign was taken down, and the name of the new purchaser was hung up in its place. `I was somewhat surprised that my son-in-law had not told me of this; but supposed he intended when he came back to begin business anew in some other part of the city. But I shortly found out that he had not left the city at all.' `So I guessed!' observed David Dalton. `I discovered it in this way. I was at dinner, and my neighbour Mr. Felton came in and said bluntly, `Neighbour Wilson, you remember once about saying how much your son-in-law, that now is, looked like that dissipated Temple?' `Yes,' I answered. `Well, I have discovered something still more stronger. I met, not half an hour ago, riding with this Temple, one who looks as like your son-in-law, and a young woman, who is the very image of your daughter, only a little paler and less lively. Now if this double resemblance isn't remarkable I don't know what is.' `I assure you, Mr. Gustavus, that I could not help thinking it remarkable; and perhaps you will be surprised when I say that I had not the most distant suspicion of any thing wrong. I believed him to be all that he seemed, and that they were then two hundred miles from Boston in Vermont. Still I could not help thinking a good deal about what had been told me, and closely questioned the person who told me, who said that had he not known my daughter was out of town, and could never have been known to such a person as Temple, he should have said, that she looked more sad than Ann was used to, that it was she herself.' `During the day I forgot the matter entirely, for there being no suspicious in my mind, it soon died out. But just at dark my little boy, Charles here, came running in out of breath, saying that he had seen his sister Ann at a window of a fine house, and that she beckoned to him, and seemed to be weeping; and a man, that looked just like her husband, Edward Carter, but wasn't he, pulled her angrily away, and dropped the curtain. I was surprised at this, and should have doubted what he said, supposing he had mistaken some other person for her, but instantly what my neighbour had told me at noon rushed to my mind. I felt at once a strong desire to see for myself who this person was. I spoke with my wife about it, and the more we talked the heavier our hearts grew; but from what reason we could not tell. We felt sad, and a sort of foreboding of evil oppressed my spirits. Still, there was nothing defined, nothing that took the shape of suspicion that all was not right with our daughter. `Nevertheless,' said I to my wife, `I will go to this house where Henry saw this female, for I feel that I can't sleep till I satisfy myself about her. I do not believe it in Ann; still there is a feeling about my heart that won't be removed till I know all about this! Come, Charles,' said I, taking my hat, come and show me the house where you saw the young woman who looked so like your sister. He said he could find it at once and we went out together, my wife praying that we might not bring back any evil reports for it seemed to her that some unknown evil was hanging over us like a cloud.' CHAPTER XII. THE DISCOVERY. `The night was clear and frosty, and we had to work sharp to keep ourselves warm,' said William Wilson, resuming his narrative of the circumstances which had led to the death of Henry Temple. `My boy told me that the house in which he had seen the young woman so like his sister, was in H— street, near the State House. At length we reached the street, and came in front of the dwelling. It was a large, three-story house, and very gentel-looking. Its blinds were all closed, but on crossing the street and going near, I could see that lights shone through the curtains of the front windows. I asked Charles to tell me at which window he had seen the young woman when she beckoned to him, and whom he was firmly persuaded was his sister, and he pointed to one in the second story over the door. I was resolved at loast to find out who lived there, and there being a grocery on the corner a few steps distant, I walked in and purchased a penny worth of tobacco, and at the same time asked who lived in the house in question. `That,' said the man, with a significant smile, `is Temple's house—they call it his seraglio!' `What Temple?' I asked. `The rich young Temple.' `As soon as I heard this name I recollected what my neighbor had said about the young woman, so like Ann, who was riding with Temple, and I now saw that my boy had also seen her at his window, and struck by the likeness, had taken her to be his sister. I, therefore, left the shop, and resolved to return home. But as I repassed the house I could not help asking myself why she should have beckoned to Charles, which he continued to repeat most positively that she did. `I stopped before the house with an irresistable desire to enter it. It seemed to me that my peace of mind was in some way hanging upon the occupants. Impulsively I approached the door, ascended the steps and rung. Before I could frame an inquiry, the door opened, and so immediately upon my ringing, that I knew some one had his hand upon the knob to come out. There were two young men in caps and cloaks, who stared at me and passed out, calling back and saying, “Good night, Temple.” ` “Good night!” said a voice in the hall, that made my heart leap from my heart to my brain. It was the voice of my daughter's husband. The next moment Temple, richly dressed, stood in the door which he was about to close after his guests who had walked rapidly away, when he saw me by the light from the hall lamp. I had my little boy by my hand. The light shone clearly upon us. He recognized me at once, and exclaimed in mingled anger and alarm, ` “The infernal devil! He here! I am caught now!” `If he had not uttered this exclamation, Mr. Gustavus, and thus betrayed his knowledge of me, I might have been deceived by him into the belief that he and Carter were two different persons. If he had betrayed no sign of knowing me, as doubtless he would have done, had I not taken him so completely by surprise, I should have easily been deceived. But his exclamation, his tone and manner assured me that I had in some manner been that man's victim. Still, how, in what way, I had no definite idea. ` “Is your name Temple?” I asked, hardly knowing how to act or what to say; for I had yet no suspicion of the truth that was soon to overwhelm me. ` “It is, fellow—what do you wish?” he demanded all at once, assuming his self-possession. ` “Do you know a young man by the name of Edward Carter?” ` “I know no such person,” he haughtily said, closing the door, but which I pressed open again; for Charles whispered and said it “was Edward himself!” This I began to believe, though I was greatly bewildered. ` “How came you to know me?” I asked, greatly agitated. ` “I do not know you. Don't keep me here in the cold. You have impudence enough to come to a gentleman's door to ask after your low cronies. Begone.” ` “Edward Carter had a scar directly over his eye-brow`” continued William Wilson, “and though small, it was a very peculiar one. I had often noticed it. A sudden recollection of this came upon me. I stepped closely up to his face and looked at him fixedly. I saw the scar there, and my be wildering suspicions were confirmed. ` “Young man,” I cried, laying my hand firmly upon his arm, “I know you and you know me. You cannot deceive me.— Whether your name be Temple or Carter, you are the person who married my daughter. Do not say you do not know me.— There is villainy somewhere. I will finit out and you too. Where is my daughter?” “`I know nothing about your daughter,” he answered, turning as pale as death, and endeavoring to free himself from my hold: but the grasp of an injured father is closer than iron. We stood in the hall together, the door having closed as he struggled.— We stood face to face. “`My daughter! Where is my child?” I demanded, “for you are the person who took her from me. I am a victim to thy treachery. Why art thou here, when I supposed thee in Vermont? Speak, and unfold all this mystery.” “`I have no mystery to unfold.” he answered. “I have not seen your daughter.” `At this instant Charles, who is naturally bold and intelligent above boys of his age, shouted to me from up stairs, whither he had run as we struggled, to see if his sister was not in the chamber in which he beheld her at the window. He now called out, “Father, Ann is here. She is locked up.” `I had no sooner heard this cry than I dashed the villain from me across the hall, and hastened up stairs. I found Charles at a door. He said his sister was within, calling upon him by name. I also heard her voice, “Father, father, save me!” `With the strength of a lion, and with something of the lion's rage, I dashed in the door by kicking against it. There was my daughter, indeed. I beheld her upon her knees and in tears. She shrunk from me, crying, “Forgive me! oh, forgive me.” I clasped her to my heart. I did not ask her what I should forgive. The extent of the evil that had befallen her I did not know or imagine. “Take me home,” said she, “take me home, and you shall know all.” “`Is not your husband a villain?” I asked her. “`He is not my husband!” she cried in tones of anguish that pierced my bosom. “He has deceived me by a false name, a false priest, and a false marriage. The Edward Carter I supposed I had married was Edward Temple in disguise. The disguise and the shop he assumed to effect my ruin; and God knows how thoroughly he has accomplished his end. I am degraded and lost.” `Such,' continued William Wilson, ` were my daughter's words to me in the hurried moments of our meeting. My blood boiled within me. I saw at once all the villainy of the impostor, and I did not stop to reflect. I bade her follow me with her brother, and hastened down stairs to confront the villain and avenge myself for the deep wrongs he had done me. But he had flown, dreading the vengeance he knew that he so well mer ited. I took my weeping daughter home with me. I will not attempt to describe to you the scene that passed when her mother met her and learned all that had happened. We all for a while seemed stupified, so sudden was the shock, so unlooked for, such a fall from happiness to infamy and wretchedness. `None of us slept that night. My daughter related to us all that had passed. She said that instead of leaving town when she took leave of us, that Temple drove to the house where I had found her. Upon her expressing her surprise, he said that they were rooms he had fitted up for her to take possession of as soon as they returned from their trip to Vermont; and that he intended to remain there till the next day, as business compelled him to delay their departure.— This explanation was satisfactory to a young and confiding wife, for wife she supposed she was, and she went in with him, greatly delighted and surprised at the elegant style in which the rooms were furnished. After she had been there an hour she expressed a desire to return to her home and let us know she remained in town. But he said that it would only make a second parting necessary; and besides he needed her there to entertain a party of his friends whom he had invited to celebrate his wedding. So as evening arrived several young gentlemen came,' said my daughter, `each accompanied by a very handsome young lady, all of whom she received with kindness and hospitality. An elegant supper was prepared to which all sat down, and the evening passed away in great festivity. But she set all this gaiety down to the unusual occasion of a wedding supper; and her suspicions were not awakened. It is true she thought the young ladies were rather bold and the young gentlemen somewhat free in their conversation; but Temple told her not to mind it, it was the champagne. `By some excuse or other he managed to keep her in the house two days, during all which time her suspicions were not awakened. On the morning of the third day he promised to start for Vermont with her, and she accompanied him in a carriage out of town; but it was only to meet the same party at a fashionable resort in the country a few miles. Here she began to suspect that she had married a dissipated man; but no further did her fears extend. It was on her return that she was seen by my neighbors. The crisis now approached when the veil was to be withdrawn by which she had been blinded. After she had reached the house again, she began to urge Temple with tears to permit her to go and see her parents. But this he refused, saying they should leave the next day for Varmont.— She represented to him how often he had promised this, and she feared that there was something wrong. He laughed and told me not to fear, she would by and by be the happiest woman in Boston. He then left her to go away with one or two friends who called for him. He had no sooner gone than she resolved she would secretly pay us a visit. So she put on her hat and shawl and hastened down stairs: but was met in the hall by a servent who told her she could not go out. `Am I a prisoner?' she asked surprised. `I have orders to keep you from going out, Miss.' said the man. `Miss,' repeated my daughter. `I am a married woman and beg you will address me with the respect due to me!' `At this, the man laughed coarsely and was about to make some insulting answer, when the door-bell rang. He went to open it and admitted a young gentleman who was a frequent visitor and whom my child had taken a strong aversion to, from seeing the bold and lawless admiration with which he regarded her. She was about retiring up stairs on beholding him when he called out to her:— `Is Temple at home, my dear?' `He is out,' answered the servant. `Then I will wait for him. His beauty here will entertain me pleasantly enough!' `With these words he approached my daughter, who alarmed, she hardly knew why or wherefore, hurried up the stairs. In three bounds he was by her side and his arm about her waist, his lips pressed to hers! She shrieked and endeavored to break from him. She called on the servant for aid, who laughed and merely said, `You had better be cautious, `sir, Mr. Temple wont like this if she tellshim!' `I shall certainly inform my husband of this outrage!' she said releasing herself. `Your husband, pretty one,' he answered with a sneer. `Pray who is your husband?' `Mr. Edward Carter, sir. He will avenge this insult.' `Mr. Edward Carter my dear, is none other than Harry Temple,' said he. `Has Harry kept up the game so long. I thought he had told you by this time. Well, as the cat is out, I may as well tell you that your supposed husband is the fashionable Harry Temple. These are his rooms. He pretended to be a boot-maker to get you to marry him! But it was no marriage, my dear; for Dick Shuffle was the priest. The fact is, my dear, you are Temple's mistress, and by and by I hope you will be mine.— He will tire of you in a week and be led off by some other attraction.' `The whole truth now flashed with arrows of fire upon my daughter's senses. She had heard him called Temple and Har ry, but he had explained it by saying to her that he so strikingly resembled Harry Temple that his friends, in jest, often called him by the same name! This satisfied her at the time, but now, all at once, the fearful truth forced itself upon her mind. Her head swam, and she sank to the floor insensible. `When she revived she found this young man bending over her. She had consciousness enough to know who it was, and strength enough to break from his caresses. She flew to her chamber and locked herself in. At length Temple returned. She threw wide the door to admit him, and charged him with his guilt. At first he was surprised, but he laughed and confessed that all she charged him with was the truth. He then endeavored to soothe her and to induce her to submit to her fate; but finding it in vain he left her with curses. He locked her in. It was shortly after this that Charles saw her at the window weeping which led to her discovery and release.' CHAPTER XIII. THE SURRENDER. `Your account of Temple's villainy,' said Mr. Gustavus to William Wilson,' has painfully interested me. I begin already to see the heavy causes which led to his death by your hand. Will you inform me how this occurred?' `Although I have made my story so very long,' answered Wilson, `still this remains to be told. By this time I see that both of you look upon me with more sympathy than before. I trust I shall show you that I have done only what every man placed in my situation, would have been strongly tempted to do. I have told you that the same night I brought her home, none of us slept. I walked the room till dawn, planning some mode of vengeance—some way of punishing the offender. I had been wounded most grievously in my honor, as a father and a man! My daughter, by a false and inquitous marriage had been degraded. I thought of an appeal to the law; but what could the law do? He was rich, I was poor. I should be defeated, perhaps; and ruin would follow disgrace. Day broke upon me before I had resolved what course to pursue. I ate no breakfast. I sallied out and hastened to the old bootman's. I resolved to ascertain how far he had been a partner in this false scheme of guilt against me and mine. I soon found he had been deceived, and when I told him what had been done he was overcome with surprise and indignation. He advised me to take the law of Temple. Leaving him I went straight to the dwelling of the imposter, hoping to find him in, and resolved to compel him to marry my child honestly. For the purpose of enforcing my resolution, I armed myself with a small hatchet, that I took from my workshop. I had no intention of using it, but only to intimidate and compel him to do as I wished. He was not home. The servant said he had not been in since the the day previous, and had probably gone to New York. I left the house filled with grief and a burning desire of vengeance upon the head of the despoiler. More than once I resolved to start at once for New York, and I was only deterred from going by a suspicion that the villain was still in the city. I wandered about all day. I could not bear to return to my now wretched home. I went into every resort frequented by dissipated youth, in hopes to meet him. Night came upon me, and I slowly sought my dishonoured roof. I entered and sat down in silence. My wife seeing my distressed looks did not speak. But I observed she wished to say something, and I at length asked what it was.— She asked me if I had seen Ann. This was the name of my poor child. I inquired if she was not home; she said that she had left soon after breakfast, saying she would soon be back. There was new cause for grief, sir. The idea flashed upon my mind that she had gone to drown herself. This I suggested to my wife, and thus filled my house with lamentations.— `Better die, than live a dishonored life,' said I; but I rose up and went forth to seek her, not knowing where to go. But walking, and the air out of doors helped the pressure upon my heart.' `Sir,' said Mr. Gustavus, pressing his hand in his, `be assured I deeply feel for you.' `If I ever pitied a man in my life,' said David Dalton, `it is you, William Nelson. I don't blame you now, if you had met and killed the villain. He deserved it.' `No man, Mr. Dalton,' said Mr. Gustavus, should take the law into his own hands. Whatever may be the grievance, the law of the land should be appealed to for protection.' `You are right, sir,' said William Wilson, `I feel that you are right. I should have left my case in the hands of my country; but you shall hear what followed.— After I left my house I bent my steps instinctively towards the residence of Henry Temple. I came opposite the house and stood in the shade of the building, on the other side of the street watching it. I stood there an hour brooding over my wrongs. I felt that the destroyer of my peace was there concealed; I resolved to enter the house by force and search for him. I crossed the street with my hatchet in my hand to batter the door in; for I believe, sir, I was not exectly in my sane mind, else I should not have adopted such a course which would at once have placed me under arrest, but I did not reflect. I had but one idea, that of my child's disgrace, and vengeance upon the wrongdoer; just as I was about to ascend the steps, I heard two persons coming along the walk: I drew back into a recess adjoining the house to wait till they should pass. As they came near, I overheard their conversation, and hearing Temple's name uttered I was all ears. They stopped at the door and continued to talk, for they were to separate there; from their words I learned that Temple was in town, and that my daughter had taken up with a life of prostitution She had fled, it appeared, from my house, for the purpose of finding Temple, to urge him to redress her great wrong hy marrying her—instead of meeting him, she met at the house of one of his friends who deceitfully promised to see her righted; and told her if she would go to his rooms he would send for Temple, and there compel him to marry her. She believed him, and went along with him, but the result was that she soon found herself deceived. She, at length, finding her ruin inevitable, and dreading to return to home consented, in a sort of despair, to remain with him upon the terms he proposed to her. Gladly would I pass over this revelation of my child's sudden descent into depravity. These facts I learned from the conversation I overheard, for it was wholly about Temple and my lost child. One of the young men was the person who had thus beguiled her—they parted, and the young fellow went on, while the other entered the house. I followed the former to ascertain where my child was, and saw him go to his house.— As he entered, I entered with him, and found my child, but she fled on seeing me. I implored her to return with me, when she answered that her destiny was fixed, and that all I could say would not move her; she said she was lost, and that she could never dishonour my roof by returning to it. `I then left the house in despair, and my bosom on fire with vengeance, and thus lost my child for ever, and I had but one desire left, and this was to avenge myself upon her destroyer. I knelt in the street, and raising my hands to heaven, swore that I would neither eat nor drink until I had avenged my dishonour. `I went back to his house, for I was fully persuaded he was there; I did not approach by the street but in the rear; I climbed the area fence, and descended into the yard, and then stole up the steps of the back piazza. I took off my shoes and noiselessly crossed it; I could see the faint glow of a light through the crimson curtains of the back parlour windows.— These windows reached to the floor of the piazza. `I listened at one of them. I heard laughter. Temple's voice reached my ears. It had a terrible effect upon me. I heard him boasting of his deed of villainy. I was maddened. I did not stop to see whether the window was fastened. I raised my hatchet, and in three blows dashed in the sash, and, amid the wreck of glass I leaped into the room. He had been seated at a supper table with two of his companions, but all three sprung with alarm to their feet on my entrance in this manner. He at once recognized me, and seeing me armed with the gleaming hatchet, uttered a cry of alarm, and fled from the room followed by his friends. I pursued. I came up with him in the hall. I seized him by the throat and with one blow of my hatchet I struck him to the floor. I clove his skull. He fell dead without a groan, at my feet. What followed I hardly recollect, till I found myself wandering on the Common. Doubtless the instinct of self-preservation had led me to effect my escape as soon as I found I had killed him; but I do not recollect escaping. I had reached the Common, I know not how. I still held the bloody weapon in my hand. I threw it far from me into the pond. I then conceived the idea of surrendering myself to justice. I felt glad at the act. My revenge had been satisfied. I had punished with death the despoiler of my house. I had wiped off the dishonor in his blood. I walked towards Tremont street. I saw a watchman and approached him to tell him what I had done, and surrender myself. But the thought of my poor wife and children came over me. I hesitated. I turned aside, resolving at first to go home and see them, and do something to provide for their safety and support, ere I left them destitute. My wife was sitting up. I told her all that I had done—of the utter loss of our child, and of the murder of her destroyer. `She prevailed on me, at length, to conceal myself. I yielded to her tears and prayers and those of my children. For several weeks, I have been hiding under various disguises. I have been on the verge of arrest repeatedly. No less than nine times have the officers of justice been searching the house; but the devotion of my wife has saved me from discovery. In the meanwhile my family has been reduced to poverty and want. I resolved this morning that I would hide no longer, but give myself up and bear the worst. Your goodness, gentlemen, to my family, has inspired me to make a full disclosure to you. Mr. Gustavus, I have now made all known to you. Your advice I will abide by, as I know that you will advise me wisely. I do not seek to palliate my crime. I have told you the whole of the circumstahces, that I may show you that the deed I have committed was not unprovoked.' `Your account, Mr. Wilson, said Mr. Gustavus, has been listened to by me with the deepest interest. I am glad you have told me all. Your guilt is greatly extenuated by the circumstances. Believe me that a jury of your country will acquit you when they have heard all the circumstances as I have heard them. My advice to you is, that you surrender yourself to-day into the hands of justice. I will see the judge at once, and inform him of all you have told me, and an officer shall call for you and take you quietly away to prison. During your detention there I pledge myself so see that your family is in want of nothing.' `Sir, you are too generous.' `By no means. I will see that you have able counsel. Your case shall be managed with justice and equity, and I promise you an acquital before the tribunal of the land. Are you willing to abide a trial?' `I will do it most cheerfully, sir. I shall feel far better, whether I am condemned or acquitted, than I do now. So long as I have nothing to fear on my poor wife's account, I will cheerfully go to jail.' `I think this is your best course, William,' said David Dalton. `You will have every husband and father in town on your side, believe me. I don't blame you. I should have done the same. He deserved death; but I wish it had been by the hangman rather than by your hand. But as his crime was not capital, he would have escaped with a fine, which he was well able to pay. I agree with Mr. Gustavus, that a man better not take the law in his own hands, 'specially such a serious thing as killing a villain: but as you have done so, I think for one you will be justified, and a jury will acquit you on what is called justifiable homicide.' `Hardly, Mr. Dalton,' said Mr. Gustavus, smiling, `hardly on that ground. Mr. Wilson will be acquitted I trust, on the ground of mercy and sympathy with a father who in a state of phrenzy, and under excitement of mind amounting to insanity, punished with death the dishonorer of his child.' `So he is acquitted I care not how it is,' answered David stoutly, rising up as Mr. Gustavus had done, to go. `Take heart, ma'am. Nobody blames your husband.— He will come out bright. Don't doubt it.' `Indeed, sir, I cannot doubt it. It was a fearful thing for him to take the life of another, but I do hope and believe he will be acquitted when all the provocation he had is known. It is better he should give himself up. His mind will feel easier; and since you speak so encouragingly, I shall not say a word against his going to prison.' Mr. Gustavus in a few moments left, after bidding William Wilson to keep up good courage. David went with him, saying he meant to be back again after he had been to his family, and go with him and the officer to the prison. We shall not describe the feelings of mingled sadness and hope which filled the hearts of this family after the departure of their two kind benefactors William Wilson dressed himself in his ordinary male attire, shaved, and calmly waited for the officer to whom he was to deliver himself.— Anny busied herself in mending some of his clothing, and in preparing something for him for him to eat before he should go. Charles plead earnestly to be permitted to accompany him, but was finally content to remain when his father told him how useful he would be to his mother. At length the carriage arrived, and Mr. Gustavus, David, and a pleasant looking officer came in together. William rose, and going up to the officer, said, `I surrender myself to you, as I suppose you have come for me.' The parting was sorrowful with his family; but when Mr. Gustavus assured his wife and children that they could see him every day, they dried their tears and surrendered him with hope and prayers of faith to the custody of the law. In a few minutes afterwards they all entered the carriage and drove away towards the prison. CHAPTER XIV. THE WINDING UP OF EVENTS. The arrest and imprisonment of William Wilson created no little excitement in the community. The penny papers the next morning came out with columns headed by large capitals announcing the event; and newsboys proclaimed in shrill tones to every passer-by, that their papers contained a full account of the arrest and confession of `Wilson the murderer of Henry Temple.' For a day or two this subject was the oaly one talked upon. Some hoped he would be hanged, while others believed hat he would escape conviction. All seemed to agree in the opinion that Temple had deserved his fate; for the fact that he had ruined Wilson's daughter now came out. In the meanwhile the unhappy man remained an inmate of the prison to the custody of which had voluntarily surrendered himself. Through the agency of Mr. Gustavus, excellent council was engaged for him in the person of a gentleman of the highest order of talent, and who had more than once devoted it to the defence of the innocent and unfortunate. The papers at length got hold of the true merits of the case, and publishing the whole story of Temple's deceptions, enlisted public sympathy in favor of the prisoner. In the solitude of his cell he was not without consolation. Although he condemned himself for his hasty act and regretted deeply at having taken the life of a human being, when the law was open to avenge and protect, still the innate consciousness that Temple had mortally wronged him and brought his death upon himself by his own crimes, lessened much the weight of guilt upon his mind. He was daily visited by the lovely Anny, who brought him many little comforts, and books, and sat and read to him, mostly out of the bible. At home his wife's situation he knew was made more endurable by the kindness of Mr. Gustavus, who also daily visited him and encouraged him with the hope of acquital, or, if he should be convicted, of prompt pardon by the Governor. The enemies of William Wilson were active in their efforts to bring him to the gallows. They were the relatives of Temple, and were actuated by all that better hostility which so often exhibits itself in the revenge which is taken up by kindred for one of their own blood. They had engaged the most effectual council they could obtain, and openly expressed their confidence that Wilson would yet swing for the crime he had been guilty of. While so many individuals were interested in this matter, did it not produce any effect upon the young girl, Ann Wilson, who was indirectly the couse of all that had transpired? Did not the death of her lover—the wretched flight of her father pursued by justice—his arrest and imprisonment, and his approaching trial for his life, move her? We will follow her and seek her out and learn whether these things impressed her. It was late the morning after her father's arrest that she came down stairs into a parlor, gorgeously furnished, but every thing now strewed around in the utmost confusion. The curtains were closely drawn, and shutters closed, ten o'clock. A lamp burned dimly upon the side-board, which was covered with wine glasses and decanters, some of them overturned. A table in the midst of the room was strewn with cards and splashed with spilled wine. Cards were upon the carpet also. A chair was upset, and a broken wine glass near it had been crushed under the heel and gronnd into the carpet. The young girl who entered paused as she advanced a step into this bacchanalian chaos, and looking around her, curled her lip with scorn and contempt. `This is very fine,' said she. `I will teach George better doings than this. He invites a set of his friends here who keep me awake till day-break, and then go off, leaving uproar behind them. George,' she said, stepping acrsss the room to a sofa where tay stretched out in deep sleep a young man in his vest and shirt-sleeves. He did not answer, as she stood and bent her eyes fixedly upon him, as he lay with his head partly hanging over the side of the sofa. She looked very beautiful as she thus stood bending intently and with an anxious air over him. She was youthful, scarce seventeen years having gone over her head —years of innocence and peace until within two months past, when the despoiler came and hurled her with himself into the vortex of guilt. She was a bolder and handsomer likeness of her lovely twin-sister, Anny. She had all Anny's delicacy of features, but with more fire in the eye—more decision in the lip. Perhaps the events of the last few weeks had stamped a new character there. It is likely it was so.— Woman, once fallen, falls low! If a stain come upon the robes of her virgin purity, she does not hesitate to plunge into the fountain of guilt and dye them all over. Her fall is like that of a star, sudden, brilliant, and darkness all! No sooner had Ann Wilson, naturally a proud girl, found herself degraded through the deceit and wickedness of her lover, than with a recklessness, all unaccountable, yet common to her sex in such circumstances, she gave herselt up without reserve to the current of her fate. She became, after Temple's death, the mistress of a gay young gentleman, and gave herself up to a life of the wildest, maddest enjoyment. She seemed suddenly to have been converted into a Circe. There was no excess of guilty pleasure that she did not take the lead in. The horrible death of Temple, instead of appalling her, only seemed to inspire her with ferocious joy. Those who knew Anny Wilson in her maiden modesty would never have recognised her now. Proud of his conquest, proud of her wit and beauty, George — took her with him to New York and other places. She was about four weeks pursuing a round of pleasure of the most exciting kind. She returned only the afternoon of her father's arrest. She had not wholly forgotten her home. She resolved that she would go and see them that very evening, and give them money, for she knew that they were poor. That evening there was a supper at George Shelton's rooms, and she was detained by him to preside. The guests remained late, and departed, leaving him upon the sofa insensible through wine; but one of them before quitting took care secretly to steal his pocket-book. It was now ten o'clock, and still he slept. She bent over him with an anxious earnest air. For a moment she thought he was dead. She repeated his name nervously again, when he opened his eyes and fixed them vacantly upon her. `Come, George, it is the middle of the forenoon: I am going out, and you must get up.' He rose to his feet, and looking at her sternly, said: `You are not going out!' `I am,' she responded firmly. `Do you suppose I have forgotten my mother and my father? I am not quite so lost as that.' `If you go out of this house you shall never enter it again!' `Very well—there are enough that I can enter,' she answered with a smile that he did not like. `I will give you an hour.' `I shall come back when I choose—I am not your slave, George Shelton!' At this moment the lazy servant-girl brought in the morning paper, which had been for the last three hours stuck in the latch of the street door. `Give it to me,' said Shelton; and taking it from her he sat down and opened it, at the same time ordering her to bring him coffee. `Ha! what is this? Here is news for you, Anny,' he said abruptly. `What is it?' she eagerly asked. `I see that they have nabbed your father. Look there! He is in jail, and will be tried for his life!' As he spoke he showed her the paragraph; which she had no sooner read than she burst into tears. `My poor father!' `I hope they will hang him—he deserves it for killing such a fine fellow as Temple!' `If my father's hand had not avenged me, mine should!' she answered with a spirit that made him start. `Your's!' `Yes, mine! He deserved the death he got. He was base, craven, and full of guilt. I am only sorry that his death should put in jeopardy my father's life. Had he fallen by my hand, willingly would I die, feeling that I had lived long enough.' `Why, Ann, you are a perfect little demon—I am really afraid of you!' `You have not injured me as Henry Temple did—I neither fear nor love you. Him I first loved and then hated. My poor father! Oh, that I could save him. I will hasten to him.' `He would spurn you, you well know.' `True—you speak too truly, George. He would refuse to see me—he knows that I have thrown myself away. But I will see my mother; she will receive me—she will forgive me! I have a sister and a brother too, who still will love me. This news of my dear father's imprisonment has brought all back again. Oh, that I were once more what I have been!' `Ann, where is my pocket-book?' he said, missing his money. `I do not know.' `It had three hundred dollars in it in bills. You have taken it: you mean to desert me, and have stolen it.' `Had I such an intention I should not first have waked you,' she answered with scorn and an expression of contempt on her fine features. `If you have lost it, it has been taken by some one of your cronies.' `They were gentlemen! It is in your possession—give it back to me!' he cried in anger. `I have not seen it; do not anger me, George.' `I will have you arrested! Surrender it and I will say nothing more.' `I know nothing about it,' she answered. `Seek it among your friends.' As she spoke she turned away from him, as if to leave the house. With a deep oath he sprung after her and caught her by the shoulder; she escaped from him up stairs. He followed and came up with her in her chamber, but not before she had caught up a dirk that lay upon the toilet table. It was a jewelled toy of his own. She confronted him with it upraised. He struggled to get possession of it, and received it to the hilt in his breast! With a cry of horror and pain he fell backward, and expired cursing her as the cause of his death. For a moment she remained gazing upon the bleeding corpse of her paramor, and with a shriek of despair buried the ensanguined weapon in her own heart, and fell dead upon his body! The tragic end of his child was not made known to Wilson until three days after it had occurred, and then he read it in the sad looks of Ann, the lovely lame girl who so affectionately devoted herself to him. It required all the encouragement of Mr. Gustavus, David, and the sight of his destitute family, to enable him to bear up under this new trial. At length he became composed, and seemed to rejoice in her death, saying, `It is better that she is gone! She will have less guilt to answer for at the bar of heaven! Wife, I care little to live—I shall be glad if I am condemned to death. When I am gone, you will find friends. It will grieve me to part from you, and Ann, and Charles; but my heart is broken—my spirit crushed! I can never hold up my head again. It is better that I should be found guilty, and be mercifully sent out of a world where I find only misery. As for you and my two little lambs, God will temper to you the winds, and bless you!' The day of the trial came; but notwithstanding the talents of his counsel, the efforts of the benevolent Mr. Gustavus, the sympathy of the public, he was convicted, but recommended to the mercy of the court. The judge gave sentence of death upon him; but the same night waited on the governor, and prayed him to exercise his prerogative and pardon him. Numerous similar applications were made, but without success. Several criminals had been pardoned of late by the executives of other States, and great complaints were made by the press about it. The governor felt that it was necessary to make an example, and turned a deaf ear to all the appeals which were daily made to him. His answer invariably was: `Men must know that while there are laws in the land, they must not take vengeance into their own hands!' So, in order that men might learn this wholesome truth—and not for his crime— William Wilson was hanged. His wife the same day died of a broken. Ann ha since become the wife of Mr. Gustavuss and Charles is a promising civil engineer, and engaged to be married to the youngest daughter of David Dalton. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WORKS PUBLISHED BY WILLIAMS, BROTHERS, 24 Ann Street, New York, and 6 Water Street, Boston. Dealers can procure supplies of the following works at any book-stores in the United States, as well as at the publishers' offices, where the smallest, as well as the most extensive orders (post-paid) will be promptly attended to. Isabel of Bavaria; OR, THE CHRONICLES OF FRANCE FOR THE REIGN OF CHARLES VI. BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS. It has been frequently remarked, that the romance of real life abounds with events infinitely more extraordinary and interesting than any thing that has ever emanated from the imagination of the poet or the novelist; and a perusal of this work will amply prove the truth of this assertion. After a careful examination of the sources from which the author professes to have derived his materials, the Translator is satisfied that every event recorded in these Chronicles is historically correct in all its most important features, and that the characters here depicted are genuine representations of the originals. That vividness of style and those animated descriptions in which M. Dumas so greatly excels will be found, in the translation, to possess all their original brilliance; and the utmost care has been taken to preserve the many useful lessons that may be derived from this diffuse yet minute historical sketch. Much vice is here portrayed, without offending delicacy; and the description of those turbulent times of old — of bigotry combined with loose morality — of unlimited power with impotent laws — may induce us to congratulate ourselves that we live in an age when Christianity is something more than a name, and the laws by which society are regulated and controlled something more than a dry, inefficient code. Price, 50 cents. Sylvandire; OR, THE DISPUTED INHERITANCE. BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS. Translated from the French by Thomas Williams, Esq. This novel possesses interest altogether as striking as any that have been as yet produced by this admirable writer. The plot of it is conducted with more than usual skill. In it are portrayed the agonizing horrors resulting from the system of arbitrary imprisonment during the reign of Louis XIV., by which husbands were torn from their families in the dead of night, and immured in the Bastile, or other state prisons; there kept in solitary confinement for years, without being able to communicate with their families, who, indeed, remained in utter ignorance of their fate. The author also delineates, with a masterly hand, the continually recurring court intrigues, in which the characters of the King, Madame de Maintenon, Père Lettlellier, and d' Argenson, the police minister, are admirably given; the whole blended with a domestic history of the most amusing nature. Price, 50 cents — complete. Acte of Corinth; OR, THE CONVERT OF SAINT PAUL. BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, Author of “Diana of Merior,” “Captain Paul,” “Genevieve,” etc., etc. Four beautiful Illustrations. — Translated by H. W. Herbert, Esq. This is one of the most remarkable works ever penned; and, for intense interest and vivid pictures of Roman life, it is without an equal. By able critics it is considered the choicest of all Dumas's novels. Price, 25 cents. The Count of Morion; OR, WOMAN'S REVENGE. BY FREDERICK SOULIE. This work has been selected from among Frederick Soulie's productions, as a specimen of the author's wonderful power in conducting a tale of rare dramatic interest. By whom is he surpassed as a lively and forcible delineator of French manners and sentiments? Who can rival him in the conception of treasons, conspiracies, plots, and counterplots? Price, 50 cents. Captain Paul! OR, PAUL JONES PROVED TO BE A FRENCHMAN. BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS. “Ye who have dwelt upon the sordid land, Amidst the everlasting gloomy war Of Poverty and Wealth — ye cannot know How we, the wild sons of the Ocean, mock At men who fret out life with care for gold.” Translated by T. Williams, Esq. For sale at all Periodical Depots.</field>
