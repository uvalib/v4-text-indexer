      <field name="fulltext">A 2 ADVERTISEMENT. The story which follows is rather an episode in the progress of the “Partisan,” than a continuation of that romance. It has no necessary connexion with the previous story, nor does it form any portion of that series originally contemplated by the author, with the view to an illustration of the several prominent periods in the history of the revolution in South Carolina; although it employs similar events, and disposes of some of the personages first introduced to the reader by that initial publication. The action of “Mellichampe” begins, it is true, where the “Partisan” left off; and the story opens by a resumption of one of the suspended threads of that narrative. Beyond this, there is no connexion between the two works; and the reader will perceive that even this degree of affinity has been maintained simply to indicate that the stories belong to the same family, and to prevent the necessity of breaking ground anew. Much preliminary narrative has thus been avoided; and I have been enabled to obey the good old, popular, but seldom-practised maxim, of plunging at once into the bowels of my subject. The “Partisan” was projected as a sort of ground-plan, of sufficient extent to admit of the subsequent erection of any fabric upon it which the caprice of the author, or the quantity of his material, might seem to warrant and encourage. The two works which I projected to follow the “Partisan,” and to complete the series, were intended to comprise events more strictly historical than those which have been employed in this “Santee legend.” The reader must not, however, on hearing this, be less inclined to accept “Mellichampe” as an historical romance. It is truly and legitimately such. It is imbued with the facts, and, I believe, so far as I myself may be admitted as a judge, it portrays truly the condition, of the time. The events made use of are all historical; and scarcely a page of the work, certainly not a chapter of it, is wanting in the evidence which must support the assertion. The career of Marion, as here described, during the precise period occupied by the narrative, is correct to the very letter of the written history. The story of Barsfield, so far as it relates to public events, is not less so. The account which the latter gives of himself to Janet Berkeley—occurring in the fourteenth chapter of the second volume—is related of him by tradition, and bears a close resemblance to the recorded history of the notorious Colonel Brown, of Augusta, one of the most malignant and vindictive among the southern loyalists, and one who is said to have become so solely from the illegal and unjustifiable means which were employed by the patriots to make him otherwise. The whole history is one of curious interest, and, if studied, of great public value. It shows strikingly the evils to a whole nation, and through successive years, of a single act of popular injustice. Certainly, as the ebullitions of popular justice, shown in the movements of revolution, are of most terrible effect, and of most 1* imposing consequence; so the commission of a crime by the same hands, must, in like degree, revolt the sensibilities of the freeman, and inspire him with a hatred which, as it is well founded, and sanctioned by humanity itself, must be unforgiving and extreme. The excesses of patriotism, when attaining power, have been but too frequently productive of a tyranny more dangerous in its exercise, and more lasting in its effects, than the despotism which it was invoked to overthrow. The death of Gabriel Marion, the nephew of the general, varies somewhat, in the romance, from the account given of the same event by history; but the story is supported by tradition. The pursuit of the “swamp fox” by Colonel Tarleton—a pursuit dwelt upon with much satisfaction by our historians, as an admirable specimen of partisan ingenuity on both sides, follows closely the several authorities, which it abridges. The character of Tarleton, and his deeds at this period, present a singular contrast, in some respects, to what was known of him before. His popularity waned with his own party, and his former enemies began to esteem him more favourably. We have, in Carolina, several little stories, such as that in “Mellichampe,” in which his human feelings are allowed to appear, at brief moments, in opposition to his wonted practices, and quite at variance with his general character. Nor do I see that there is any inconsistency between these several characteristics. The sensibilities are more active at one moment than at another; and he whose mood is usually merciless and unsparing, may now and then be permitted the blessing of a tear, and the indulgence of a tenderness, under the influence of an old and hallowed memory, kept alive and sacred in some little corner of the heart when all is ossified around it. The destruction of the mansion-house at “Piney Grove” by Major Singleton, and the means employed to effect this object, will be recognised by the readers of Carolina history, and the lover of female patriotism, as of true occurrence in every point of view; the names of persons alone being altered, and a slight variation made in the locality. Indeed, to sum up all in brief, the entire materials of “Mellichampe,”—the leading events,—every general action,—and the main characteristics, have been taken from the unquestionable records of history, and—in the regard of the novelist—the scarcely less credible testimonies of that venerable and moss-mantled Druid, Tradition. I have simply forborne to call it an historical romance, as it contained nothing which made an era in the time— nothing which, in its character and importance, had a visible effect upon the progress of the revolution. Let us now pass to other topics. It is in bad taste, and of very doubtful policy, for an author to quarrel with his critics: the laugh is most usually against him when he does so. I shall not commit this error, and hope not to incur this penalty; nor, indeed, have I any good cause to justify me in the language of complaint. My critics have usually been indulgent to me far beyond my merits; and I can see a thousand imperfections in my own books which they have either failed to discover, or forborne, in tenderness, to dwell upon. Farther, I may confess—and I find no shame in doing so—whenever they have dwelt upon deficiencies and defects, I am persuaded that, in most cases, they have done so with perfect justice. In many instances I have availed myself of their opinions, and subsequent editions of my stories have always borne testimony to the readiness with which, whenever this has been the case, I have adopted their suggestions. Sometimes, it is true, an occasional personal and unfriendly reference—perhaps a show of feelings even more equivocal in the case of some random reviewer—has grazed harshly upon sensibilities which are not legitimate topics of critical examination; but even these evidences of unjust assumption and false position have been more than counteracted by the considerate indulgence of the vast majority,—the kindness of the reader having more than neutralized the asperities of the reviewer. But while, in general, the opinions of the critic are acknowledged with respect and held in regard, there are one or two topics upon which I would willingly be justified with him. One friendly reviewer—a gentleman whose praise has usually been of the most generous and least qualified character—one whose taste and genius are alike unquestionable, and whose own achievements in this department give him a perfect right to be heard on all matters of romance—has made some few objections to portions of the “Partisan,” and—with all deference to his good judgment, and after the most cautious consideration—I am persuaded, with injustice. He objects to that story, in the first place, as abrupt and incomplete. That it is unfinished —that the nice hand has been wanting to smooth down and subdue its rude outlines into grace and softness in many parts—I doubt not—I deny not. The work was too rapidly prepared for that; and the finish of art can only be claimed by a people with whom art is a leading object. No other people are well able to pay for it—no other people are willing to pay for it; and, under the necessity of haste, the arts in our country must continue to struggle on, until the wealth of the people so accumulates as to enable the interior to react upon the Atlantic cities. When the forests shall cease to be attractive, we may look for society to become stationary; and, until that is the case, we shall look in vain for the perfection of any of the graceful and refining influences of a nation. But the objection of my friend was one of more narrowing compass: it was simply to the story, as a story, that he urged its want of finish—its incompleteness. This objection is readily answered by a reference to the plan of the “Partisan,” as set forth in the preface to that work. The story was proposed as one of a series, the events mutually depending upon each other for development, and the fortunes of the personages in the one narrative providing the action and the interest of all. This plan rendered abruptness unavoidable; and nobody who read the preface, and recognised the right of an author to lay down his own standards and prescribe his own plans, could possibly utter these objections. The design may have been unhappy, and in that my error may have lain; but, surely, no objection can possibly lie to the incompleteness or abruptness of the one and introductory story, if no exception was taken to the plan at first. A 3 Another, and, perhaps, more serious cause of issue lies between us. My friend objects to the preponderance of low and vulgar personages in my narrative. The question first occurs, “Does the story profess to belong to a country and to a period of history which are alike known—and does it misrepresent either?”— If it does not, the objection will not lie. In all other respects it is the objection of a romanticist—of one who is willing to behold in the progress of society none but its most lofty and elevated attributes,—who will not look at the materials which make the million, but who picks out from their number the man who should rule, not the men who should represent,—who requires every second person to be a demigod, or hero, at the least,—and who scorns all conditions, that only excepted which is the ideal of a pure mind and delicate imagination. To make a fairy tale, or a tale in which none but the colours of the rose and rainbow shall predominate, is a very different, and, let me add, a far less difficult matter, than to depict life as we discover it—man in all his phases, as he is modified by circumstance and moulded by education—and man as the optimist would have, and as the dreamer about inane perfectibility delights to paint, him. My object usually has been to adhere, as closely as possible, to the features and the attributes of real life, as it is to be found in the precise scenes, and under the governing circumstances,—some of them extraordinary and romantic, because new,—in which my narrative has followed it. In this pursuit, I feel confident that I have “nothing extenuated, nor set down aught in malice.” I certainly feel that, in bringing the vulgar and the vicious mind into exceeding activity in a story of the borders, I have done mankind no injustice; and while I walk the streets of the crowded city, and where laws are said to exist, and in periods which, by a strange courtesy, are considered civilized, I am still less disposed to admit that my delineations of the species in the wilds of our country, and during the strifes of foreign and intestine warfare, are drawn in harsh colours and by a heavy hand. I am persuaded that vulgarity and crime must always preponderate—dreadfully preponderate—in the great majority during a period of war; and no argument would seem necessary to sustain the assertion, when we look at the insolence and brutality of crime, as it shows itself among us in a time of peace. Certainly, if argument be needed, we shall not have to look far from our great cities for the evidence in either case. It is true that the novelist is, or should be, an artist, and his taste and judgment are alike required to select from his materials, and choose, for his personages, judicious lights. An undue preponderance of dark will not do in a picture, unless to produce some such pyrotechnic performances as John Martin delights in, —vast dashes of glare and gloom, alternately shifting, and an explosion of fireworks in a conspicuous centre. The discriminating eye will require that the light and shadow be so distributed that the one shall not be oppressive nor the other dense. These are general principles to be observed, not less by the poet than the painter—not less by the novelist of real life than the romancer who seeks only for extraordinary material. But it is not merely as an artist that the historical novelist is to regulate his performances. He is required to have regard to those moral objects which should be in the eye of the painter also—though not to the same extent,—since both these arts, along with those of poetry and the drama, are never so legitimately exercised as when they aim to refine the manners, soften the heart, and elevate the general standards of society and man. To paint morally, the historic novelist must paint truly; and vice was never yet painted truly, that it did not revolt the mind. One error of our time is, not to paint it truly. If we tell of the thousand crimes, we dwell with such emphasis upon the solitary virtue, that they only serve as a shadowy foil to its exceeding loveliness and light. It is curious to perceive how completely this sort of error has found its way into all our habits, not merely those of thought and taste, but those of expression. With what tenderness, nowadays, we speak of every form of vice! A drunkard, unless he is very poor and destitute, is seldom or never called a drunkard: he is only a little excited. A debauchee and gambler is simply a gay man; and a forger for millions is only guilty of a sad mistake. We become wonderfully soon reconciled to vice, when we mince the epithets which we apply to it: the vice soon ceases to be held such when we call it by a milder name. The low characters predominate in the “Partisan,” and they predominate in all warfare, and in all times of warfare, foreign and domestic. They predominate in all imbodied armies that the world has ever known. War itself is a vice, though sometimes an unavoidable one. The novelist would not draw truly, according to the facts, if he did not show that there are but few men, calculated, by ability and force of character, to lead the many; and this truth is of universal application. It belongs to the million always, and will apply to every existing nation on the surface of the globe. The question which propriety may ask, having the good of man for its object, is—“Has the novelist made vice attractive, commendable, successful, in his story? Is virtue sacrificed,—are the humanities of life and society endangered, by the employment of such agents as the low and vulgar? Is there any thing in the progress of the vicious to make us sympathize with them —to make us seek for them?” These are the proper questions, and they are such as the “Partisan” must answer for itself. Some of our critics and novelists, wanting though they may be in most standards of discrimination, have, nevertheless, sympathies and tastes in common; and, perhaps, if, instead of naked vulgarity and barefaced crime, I had robed my villains in broadcloth, adorned their fingers with costly gems, provided them liberally with eau-de-Cologne, and made them sentimental, I should have escaped all objections of this nature. It is too much the fashion to conceal the impurities which we should seek to cleanse, as some people employ the chloride of lime to sprinkle the nuisance which propriety would instantly remove.

      <field name="fulltext">2 CHAPTER I. The battle of Dorchester was over; the victorious Partisans, successful in their object, and bearing away with them the prisoner whom they had rescued from the felon's death, were already beyond the reach of their enemies, when Colonel Proctor, the commander of the British post, sallied forth from his station in the hope to retrieve, if possible, the fortunes of the day. A feeling of delicacy, and a genuine sense of pain, had prompted him to depute to a subordinate officer the duty of attending Colonel Walton to the place of execution. The rescue of the prisoner had the effect of inducing in his mind a feeling of bitter self-reproach. The mortified pride of the soldier, tenacious of his honour, and scrupulous on the subject of his trust, succeeded to every feeling of mere human forbearance; and, burning with shame and indignation, the moment he heard a vague account of the defeat of the guard and the rescue of Walton, he led forth the entire force at his command, resolute to recover the fugitive or redeem his forfeited credit by his blood. He had not been prepared for such an event as that which has been already narrated in the last pages of “The Partisan,” and was scarcely less surprised, though more resolute and ready, than the astounded soldiers under his command. How should he have looked for the presence of any force of the rebels at such a moment, when the defeat and destruction of Gates's army, so complete as it had been, had paralyzed, in the minds of all, the last hope of the Americans? With an audacity that seemed little less than madness, and was desperation, a feeble but sleepless enemy had darted in between the fowler and his prey—had wrested the victim of the conqueror from his talons, even in the moment of his fierce repast; and, with a wild courage and planned impetuosity, had rushed into the very jaws of danger, without shrinking, and with the most complete impunity. The reader of the work of which the present is offered as a continuation, will perhaps remember the manner in which we found it necessary to close that story. It was from a scene of bloody strife that we hurried the chief personages of the narrative, and, only solicitous for their safety, paused not to consider the condition of the field, or of the other parties who remained behind. To that field we will now return, and at a moment which leaves it almost doubtful whether, in reality, the strife be ended. The cry of men in their last agony—the panting prayer for a drop of water from the gasping wretch, through whose distended mouth the life-blood pours forth more freely than the accents that implore Heaven and man alike for succour and relief—the continued flight of the affrighted survivers, and the approaching rush of Proctor's troop—these speak as loudly for the dreadful conflict as the shrill blast of the hurrying trumpet, or the sharp clashing of conflicting steel. The beautiful town of Dorchester, in a bright flame at several points, illumined with an unnatural glare the surrounding fields and foliage, and, with the shrieks of flying women and children, still more contributed to the terrible force of the picture. The ruddy light bathed and enveloped for miles around, with a brilliancy deeper than that of the sun, the high tops of the towering pines, while the thick dense smoke, ascending over all, hung sluggishly and dark in the slumberous sky of August, like some of those black masses of storm that usually come in the train, and burst in ruin over the southern cities with the flight, of the sister month of September. The hurry of Col. Proctor was in vain. He came too late to retrieve the fortunes of the fight. The partisans had melted away like so many shadows. Vain were all his efforts, and idle his chagrin. He could only gaze in stupid wonderment upon the condition of the field, admiring and deploring that valour which had eluded his own, and set at naught all his precautions. Never had surprise been more complete; never had enterprise been better planned or more perfectly executed, with so much hazard and with so little loss. The whole affair was one to annoy the British commander beyond all calculation. There was nothing to remedy —there was no hope of redress. The rebels were beyond his reach, and, even were they not, the force under Proctor was quite too small, and the condition of his trust, in and about Dorchester, of too much hazard and importance, to permit of his pursuing them. Convinced of this, he turned his attention to the field of battle, every step in the examination of which only contributed the more to his mortification and regret. Several of his best soldiers lay around him in the last agonies or the final slumbers of death; several were maimed or wounded, and the few who survived and had fled from the unlooked-for combat had not, in every instance, escaped unhurt. But few of the partisans had fallen, and their wounds had all been fatal. They were no longer at the mercy of any human conqueror. There was none upon whom the mortified commander, had he been so disposed, could wreak his vengeance, and punish for the audacity of his rebel leader. The bitterness of his mood increased with the conviction that there was no victim upon whom to pour it forth. Revenge and regret were alike unavailing. While thus he mused upon the gloomy prospect and the bloody field, the soldiers, who, meanwhile, had been dispersed about in the inspection of the adjoining woods and scene of strife, came before him, bringing an individual whom they had found, the only one who seemed to have escaped unhurt in the combat. Yet he was found where the strife appeared to have been hottest. A pile of dead bodies was around him, and, when discovered, he was employed in turning over the senseless carcasses and dragging them apart, as if searching for some particular object. The British colonel started when he beheld him; and, as he gazed upon the bronzed, sinister, and well-known features, and saw with what calm indifference the blear eye of the Half-Breed Blonay met his own, a doubt of his fidelity grew active at the expense of one whose character had always been too equivocal to be held above the commission of the basest treachery. The brow of the Briton put on new terrors as he surveyed him; and, glad of any victim, even though not the most odious, he addressed the reckless savage in the sternest language of distrust. “What do you here, Blonay? Speak quickly, and without evasion, or you shall swing, by Heaven, on that gallows instead of him whom you have helped from it. Tell out the whole story of this traitorous scheme—unfold the share you had in it, and who were your abetters —who rescued the prisoner—by whom were they commanded—how many—and where are they gone? Answer, fellow; answer, and without delay; out—speak out.” Proctor could scarcely articulate his own requisitions, so intense were his anxiety and passion. The person addressed seemed almost totally unmoved by an exhortation so earnestly made, or only moved to defiance. His swarthy cheek grew even darker in its depth of hue, and his lips were now resolutely fastened together, as he listened to the language of his superior. His air, full of scornful indifference, and his position, lounging and listless, might have provoked Proctor to an act of 2* violence, had they been maintained much longer. But, as if moved by more prudent counsels from within, the Half-Breed, in a moment after, changed his posture to one of more respectful attention. The rigidity passed away from his muscles—his high cheek-bones seemed to shrink—his eyes were lowered,—and his head, which had been elevated before into an unwonted loftiness, was now suffered, in compliance with his usual habit, to fall upon one shoulder. His mood grew more conciliatory as he proceeded to reply to one, at least, of the several questions which Proctor had asked him, almost in a breath. Still, however, the reply of the Half-Breed was found rather to accord with the first than the last expression of his air and attitude. “And if you was to hang me up, colonel, you wouldn't be any the wiser, and would hear much less than if you was to let me run.” “No trifling, sirrah, but speak to the point, and quickly: I am in no mood for jest. Speak out, and say what is the part you have taken in this business. The truth, sirrah,—the truth only will serve you.” “I'm no rebel, colonel, as you ought to know by this time. As for the truth, I'm sure I can tell it, if you'd ax me one thing at a time. I aint sparing of the truth when I've got it.” “I do know you, sirrah, and know you too well to trust you much. Briefly, then, and without prevarication, do you know the parties who rescued Colonel Walton? What do you know of the matter? The whole truth; for I have the means of knowing whether you speak falsely or not.” “Well, now, colonel, I knows no great deal; but what I knows is the truth, and that I'll tell. The men who foul here were Marion's men, I reckon. I looked out from the bay-bushes there;—I was doubled up in a heap, and I seed the whole business, from the very first jump.” “Relate the matter!” “Relate—oh, ay—tell it, you mean. Why, then, sir, the rebels came down the trace, from out the cypress, I reckon, and—” “Who led them?” demanded Proctor, impatiently. “Why, I reckon 'twas Major Singleton.” “Reckon! Do you not know, sir?” “Well, yes, colonel, I may say I do, seeing that I seed him myself.” “And why, sirrah, did you not shoot him down? You knew he was a rebel—that a price was set upon his head—that you could have rendered no better service to your king and to yourself, than by bringing in the ears of a traitor so troublesome! Had you not your rifle, sirrah? Why, unless you are a rebel like himself, did you not use it?” “Adrat it, colonel, it did go agin me not to pull trigger; but, you see, colonel, 'twould ha' been mighty foolish now. More than once I had the drop on both of 'em, and could easy enough ha' brought down one or t'other with a wink; but there was no fun in it to think of afterward. I was only one shot, you see, sir, and quite too close to get away. They were all round me, and I had to lie mighty snug, or they'd ha' soon mounted through the brush upon me like so many varmints; and the swamp's a good mile off:—too far off for a man that wants to hide his head in a hurry. It's no use, colonel, you know, to lose one for one, when one's all you've got.” “Miserable coward!” exclaimed Proctor, with indignation. “Miserable coward, to count chances at such a moment; throwing away so good an opportunity. But who was the other person? You spoke of another with Singleton.” “Eh,—what?” was the vacant and seemingly unconscious reply of Blonay. The impatience of Proctor appeared to increase. “The other—the person beside Singleton. You said that your aim was upon both of them.” A quick, restless, dissatisfied movement followed on the part of the Half-Breed; and, before he replied, he drew himself up to his fullest height, while a darker red seemed to overshadow his features. His answer was hurried, as if he desired to dismiss the subject from his mind. “T'other was Bill Humphries.” “And why have you named him, in particular, with Singleton?” “'Cause I only seed him.” “What! you do not mean to say that these two men beat the guard and rescued the prisoner?” demanded the Briton, with astonishment. “Adrat it, colonel, no—I don't say so. There was a matter of twenty on 'em and more; but I didn't stop to look after the rest. I took sight at them two—first one and then t'other; and, more than once, when they were chopping right and left among the redcoats, I could ha' dropped one or t'other for certain, and would ha' done so if 'twan't for the old woman. She would go on the hill, you see.” “Who?” asked the officer. “Why, sir, the old woman. Jist when I was going to pull trigger upon that skunk Humphries, as he came riding down the road so big, I heard her cry out, and I couldn't help seeing her. She did try hard to get out of the way of the horses, but old people, colonel, you know, can't move fast like young ones, and I couldn't help her, no how.” “Of whom do you speak now?” demanded Proctor. “What old woman are you talking of?” Blonay simply lifted his finger, without changing countenance or position, while he pointed to a mangled carcass lying a few paces from the place of their conference. It was there, indeed, that the soldiers of Proctor, on their coming up, had discovered him; and the eye of the British colonel followed the direction of Blonay's finger only to turn away in horror and disgust. The miserable features were battered by the hoofs of the plunging horses out of all shape of humanity, yet Proctor was not slow to comprehend the connexion between the vagrant before him and his hag-like mother. Turning away from the spectacle, he gave directions to the men to assist in removing the carcass, under the directions of the son, whom he however proceeded to examine still farther, and from whom, after innumerable questions, he obtained all the leading particulars of the fray. It seemed evident to Proctor, when his first feeling of exasperation had subsided, that the bereaved wretch before him was innocent of any participation in the assault of the partisans, and he soon dismissed him to the performance of those solemn offices of duty, the last which were to be required at his hands for the parent he had lost. Obedient to the commands of their superior, the soldiers drew nigh, and proceeded to transfer the corpse to one of the carts, which they had now already filled in part with the bodies of some of those who had been slain. The son resisted them. “You aint going to have her to Dorchester burying-ground—eh?” “To be sure—where else?” was the gruff reply of the soldier having charge of the proceeding. “Adrat it—she won't go there,” replied Blonay. “And how the d—l can she help herself? She's as dead, poor old creature, as a door-nail, and she's been hammered much harder. See—her head's all mashed to a mummy.” He raised the lifeless mass, and allowed it to fall heavily in the cart, as if to convince the hearer, however unnecessarily, that she no longer possessed a will in the transaction. Blonay did not seem to heed the soldier, but explained his own meaning in the following words:— “There's a place nearer home the old woman wants to be buried in. She aint guine to sleep quiet in the churchyard, with all them people round her. If you wants to help me, now, you must give me a cart on purpose, and then I'll show you where to dig for her. She marked it out herself long time ago.” His wish was at once complied with, as the orders of Colonel Proctor had been peremptory. An additional cart was procured, into which the mangled remains were transferred by the soldiers. In doing this, Blonay lent no manner of assistance. On the contrary, his thoughts and person were entirely given to another office, which seemed to call for much more than his customary consideration. Bending carefully, in all directions, over the scene of strife, even as a hungry hound gathering up from the tainted earth the scent of his selected victim, he noted all the appearances of the field of combat, and with the earnest search of one looking for the ruined form of a lost but still remembered and loved affection, he turned over the unconscious carcasses of those who had fallen, and narrowly examined every several countenance. “He aint here,” he muttered to himself; and an air of satisfaction seemed to overspread his face. “I thought so—I seed him go to the cart, and he warn't hurt then. I'll chaw the bullet for him yet.” Thus saying, his search seemed to take another direction, and he now proceeded to inspect the ground on which the battle had taken place. In particular, he traced out upon the soft red clay, which had retained every impression, the various marks made by the hoofs of the shodden horses. One of these he heedfully regarded, and pursued with an air of intense satisfaction. The impression was that of a very small shoe—a deer-like hoof-trace—quite unlike, and much smaller than, those made by the other horses. There was another peculiarity in the shoe which may be noted. That of the right forefoot seemed in one place to be defective. It had the appearance of being either completely snapped in twain, and the parts slightly separated directly in the centre, or, by a stroke of the hammer, while the metal was yet malleable, it had been depressed by a straight narrow line evenly across. Whatever may have been the cause, the impression of the shoe upon the earth left this appearance of defect, making the track of its owner sufficiently conspicuous to one having a knowledge of, and on the look-out for, it. Having once satisfied himself of the continued presence of the shoe, with which he seemed to have been previously familiar, he gave over his examination; and, as the cart was now ready, and all preparations completed for the return of the party to the village, he gathered up his rifle, drew the 'coon-skin cap over his eyes, and, without a word, at once fell in procession with the rest, following close behind the body of his mother. Passing through the village of Dorchester, where they only paused to procure a coffin, which was furnished by the garrison, they proceeded directly to the miserable cabin a few miles beyond, which she had hitherto inhabited. Here, under a stunted cedar, in a little hollow of the woods behind her dwelling, a stake, already driven at head and foot, designated the spot which she had chosen for her burial-place. The spade soon scooped out a space for her reception, and in a few moments the miserable and battered hulk of a vexed and violent spirit was deposited in silence. The son lingered but a little while after the burial was over. He turned away soon after the rest; and, without much show of sympathy, and with none of its feeling, those who had thus far assisted left him to his own mood in the now desolated abiding-place of his mother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. To estimate the solitude of such a creature as Blonay under the present loss of his parent, by any of those finer standards of humanity which belong to a higher class and better habits, would be manifestly idle and erroneous. But that his isolation previously from all others, and his close dependance for sympathy upon the one relative whom he had just lost, added largely to his degree of suffering now, is equally unquestionable. Supposing his mere human feelings to have been few and feeble, they were yet undivided. Concentrating upon the one object as they had done for so long a period, they had grown steady and unwavering; and, if not very strong or very active at any time, they were at least sufficiently tenacious in their hold to make the sudden wrenching of their bands asunder to be felt sensibly by the surviver. But he did full justice in his deportment to the Indian blood which predominated in his veins. He had no uttered griefs; no tears found their way to his cheeks, and his eyes wore their wonted expression as he took his seat upon the floor of his lonely cabin, and, stirring the embers upon the hearth, proceeded, with the aid of the rich lightwood which lay plentifully at hand, to kindle up his evening fire. But, if grief were wanting to the expression of his countenance, it did not lack in other essentials of expression. Having kindled his fire, he sat for some time before it in manifest contemplation. His brow was knitted, his eyes fixed upon the struggling blaze, his lips closely compressed, and a general earnestness of look indicated a labouring industry of thought, which, were he in the presence of another person, would never have been suffered so plainly to appear. For some time he sat in this manner without change of position, and during all this period it would seem that he was working out in his mind some particular plan of conduct in the pursuit of an object of no less difficulty than importance. Of that object we can only conjecture the nature from a reference to events, and to his actual condition. The vindictive blood within him—his irresponsible position in society—the severity of the treatment to which, justly or not, he had been subjected by one of the parties between whom the province was divided—and the recent dispensation which had deprived him of the companionship of one, who, however despicable and disgusting to all others, was at least a mother to him—were circumstances well calculated to arouse the savage desire of vengeance upon those to whom any of his sufferings might be attributed. That such were his thoughts, and such the object of his deliberations, may safely be inferred from the few words of muttered declamation which fell from his lips at intervals while thus rapt in his contemplations. It would be to no purpose to record these words, since they do little more than afford a brief and passing sanction to the opinion we have thus ventured to entertain, and prove, at the same time, the character of a mood seemingly hostile to humankind in general. They were bitter and comprehensive, and summed up, to the cost of humanity, all the wrongs to which he had been subjected, and many others, wrongs in his sight only, of which he but complained. Yet an attentive listener might have observed that in what he said there was an occasional reference to one individual in particular, who was yet nameless; which reference, whenever made, called up to his black, penetrating, but blear eyes, their most malignant expression. All their fires seemed to collect and to expand with a new supply of fuel at such moments, and his swarthy skin glowed upon his cheeks as if partaking with them a kindred intensity of blaze. Vol. I.—B 3 He remained in this state of feeling and reflection for some hours, indulging his usual listlessness of habit while pursuing the thought which his mood had prompted; when, at length, as if he had arrived at a full and satisfactory conclusion, he arose from his place, supplied the fire with new brands, and, as night had now set in, proceeded to bring forth his supper from the little cupboard where it usually stood. His fare was simple and soon despatched. When this duty had been performed, he next proceeded to such arrangements as seemed to indicate his preparation for a long journey. He brought forth from the recess which had supplied him with his evening repast a small sack of corn-meal, possibly a quart or more, and a paper containing at least a pound of common brown sugar. A huge hoe, such as is used in the corn-field, was then placed by him before the blazing fire—the flour and sugar, previously stirred together, were spread thickly over it, and, carefully watching the action of the heat upon his mixture, he took due heed to remove it at that period when he perceived the flour to grow slightly brown, and the sugar to granulate and form in common particles along with it. It was then withdrawn from the fire, exposed for an hour to the air, and afterward poured into a sack made of the deerskin, which seemed to have been employed frequently for a like purpose. To this, in another skin, the remnant of a smoked venison ham was added, and the two parcels, with one or two other items in the shape of hoe-cake and fried bacon, were deposited in a coarse sack of cloth, opening in the centre like a purse, and so filled as to be worn across the saddle after the fashion of the common meal-bag. This done, he proceeded to what appeared a general overhaul of the hovel. Various articles, seemingly of value, were drawn out from their secret recesses; these were carefully packed away in a box, and, when ready for removal, their proprietor, honestly so or not, proceeded to secure them after his own manner. Leaving the cabin for an instant, he went forth, and soon returned, bearing in his hands a spade, with which, in a brief space, he dug a hole in the centre of the apartment sufficiently large to receive and conceal his deposite. Here he buried it, carefully covering it over and treading down the earth with his feet until it became as hard as that which had been undisturbed around it. Placing every thing which he was to remove ready for the moment of departure, he threw himself upon the miserable pallet of his hut, and soon fell into unbroken slumbers. The stars were yet shining, and it lacked a good hour of the daylight when he arose from his couch and began to bestir himself in preparations for departure. Emerging from the hovel with his bundles, as we have seen them prepared the night before, he placed them under a neighbouring tree, and, undoing the string from the neck of the hungry cur that kept watch in his kennel immediately beside the hovel's entrance, he left him in charge of the deposite, while he took his way to the margin of a little canebrake a few hundred yards off. There, with a shrill whistle and a brief cry two or three times repeated, he called up from its recesses a shaggy pony—a creature of the swamps—a hardy, tough, uncouth, and unclean little animal, which followed him like a dog to the hovel which he had left. The hollow of a cypress yielded him saddle and bridle, and the little goat-like steed was soon equipped and ready for his rider. This done, Blonay fastened him to a tree near his dog, and without a word proceeded to apply the torch to several parts of the building. It was not long before the flames rose around it in every quarter; and, lingering long enough to perceive that the conflagration must now be effectual, the Half-Breed at length grasped his rifle, mounted his tacky, and, followed by his ill-looking dog, once more took his way to the village of Dorchester. Moving slowly, he did not reach the village until the B 2 day had fully dawned. He then proceeded at once to the garrison, and claimed to be admitted to the presence of the commander. Proctor was too good a soldier, and one too heedful of his duty, to suffer annoyance from a visit at so early an hour; and, though not yet risen, he gave orders at once for the admission of the applicant, and immediately addressed himself to the arrangement of his toilet. With a subdued but calm air of humility, Blonay stood before the Briton—his countenance as immoveable and impassive as if he had sustained no loss, and was altogether unconscious of privation. Regarding him with more indulgence than had hitherto been his custom, Proctor demanded of him, first, if the soldiers had properly assisted him in the last offices to his mother; and next, his present business. Blonay had few words, and his reply was brief. “The old woman didn't want much help, and we soon put her away. About what I want now, colonel, it aint much, and it'll be a smart bit of time 'fore I come back to trouble you again.” “Why, where do you propose to go?” demanded the Briton. “I'm thinking to go up along by Black river, and so up into Williamsburgh, and perhaps clear away to old Kaddipah—Lynch's Creek, as they calls it now. I don't know how long I may be gone, and it's to get a paper from you that I'm come.” “To Black river and Lynch's Creek—why, know you not that the rebels are thick as hops in that quarter? What carries you there?” “There's a chap in that quarter stands indebted to me, and I wants he should settle, seeing pay-day's come and gone long ago. I aint'fear'd of the rebels, for I'm used to the woods and swamps, and 'taint often I'll be in their company. I'll keep out of harm's way, colonel, as long as I can; and when I can't keep out any longer, why, then I'll stand a shot, and have done with it.” “And what sort of paper is it that you desire from me?” asked Proctor. “Why, sir—a little protection like, that'll be good agin our own people, and stand up for my loyalty. You can say I'm a true friend to his majesty, and how you knows me; and that'll be enough, when you put your own name to it in black and white.” “But to show that to a rebel will be fatal to you. How will you determine between them?” “Every man has his own mark, colonel, same as every tree; and where the mark don't come up clear to the eye, it will to the feel or the hearing. I'm a born hunter, colonel, and must take my chance. I aint afear'd.” “And yet, Blonay, I should rather not give you a passport to go in that quarter. Can you not wait until Lord Cornwallis takes that route? Is your claim so very considerable?” “'Taint so much, colonel, but I can't do so well without it. I've been in want of it long enough, and I'm dubous him that owes me will clear away and go into North Carolina, and so I'll lose it. You needn't be scared for me, colonel; I'm not going to put my head in the bull's mouth because his hide has a price in market; and I think, by the time I get up there, Marion's men will be all off. I aint afeard.” Proctor, after several efforts to dissuade him from his purpose, finding all his efforts unavailing, gave him the required passport, which he carefully concealed from sight, and, with many acknowledgments and professions of loyalty, took his departure. From Dorchester, proceeding to the battle-ground, he again carefully noted the tracks of the one shoe, which he followed with the keen eye of a hunter, from side to side of the road, in its progress upward to the cypress swamp. Sometimes losing it, he turned to the bushes on either hand, and where they seemed disordered or broken, he continued 3* the trail, until, again emerging from the cover, he would find, and resume, the more distinct impression, as it was made upon the clay or sandy road. In this way he reached the broken ground of the swamp, and there he lost it. Alighting, therefore, he concealed his pony in a clump of bushes, and with his rifle primed and ready for any emergency, he pursued his farther search into the bosom of the swamp on foot. Here he still thought that he might find the partisans—if not the entire troop of Singleton, at least a portion of it; probably—though on this head he was not sanguine—the very object of his search. From point to point, with unrelaxing vigilance and caution, he stole along until he reached the little creek which surrounded and made an island of the spot where Singleton had held his temporary camp. The place was silent as the grave. He crossed the narrow stream, and carefully inspected the ground. It bore traces enough of recent occupation. The ashes of several fires, still retaining a slight degree of warmth—the fresh tracks of horses, that of the broken shoe among them—hacked trees, and torn bushes all told of the presence there, within a brief space, of the very persons whom be now sought. The search of Blonay, worthy of that of the ablest Indian hunter, was thorough and complete. From the one island, he took his way to sundry others which lay in its neighbourhood, susceptible of occupation, in all of which he found traces of men and horses, encouraging him to proceed farther and with continued caution. At length he passed an oozy bog, and stood upon a little hummock, which seemed formed for a place of refuge and repose. An awful silence rested over the spot, and the exceeding height of the cypresses, and the dense volume of undergrowth which surrounded and darkened the wide intervals between them, seemed almost too solid to admit of his progress. The gloom of the region had all the intensity of night, and appeared to impress itself upon the feelings of one even so habitually wanting in reverence as the Half-Breed. He paused for an instant, then moving forward by a route which he seemed to adopt with confidence, he rounded the natural obstruction of woods and thicket, and an amphitheatre opened before him, not so spacious as it was perfect. He paused suddenly —he heard a footstep—there was evidently a rustling in the woods. He stole behind a tree for an instant, sank upon his knee, lifted his rifle, which he cocked with caution, and watched the quarter intently from which the sound had arisen. A shrill scream rose upon the air, and in the next instant he beheld a monstrous wild-cat, startled like himself, and by him, bound forward to an opposite point of the area, and leap into the extending arms of a rotten tree, that shook under its pressure. Perching upon the very edge of a broken limb which jutted considerably out, it looked down with threatening glance upon his approach. He rose from his knees, and advanced to the spot from whence the animal had fled, and over which it still continued to brood with flaming eyes and an aroused appetite. It was not long before Blonay discovered the occasion of its presence. The figure of a man, huge of frame, but seemingly powerless, lay stretched upon the ground. The Half-Breed soon recognised the person of the maniac Frampton. He lay upon the little mound which covered the remains of his wife. To this he seemed to have crawled with the latest efforts of his strength. That strength was now nigh exhausted. His clothes were in tatters, and covered with traces of blood and mire. His bloodshot eyes were glazing fast. The curtain of death was nearly drawn over them, but his feeble hand was uplifted occasionally to the tree where the wild-cat sat watching hungrily for the moment when the restless but feeble motion of the dying man should cease. Blonay approached, and, as his eye glanced from man to beast, he lifted his rifle, intending to shoot the monster. The action seemed to irritate the creature, whose half-suppressed scream, as Blonay advanced his foot towards him in the act to fire, appeared to defy and threaten him. “The varmint!” exclaimed the Half-Breed, “I could shoot him now easy enough, but it's no use. There's plenty more on 'em in the swamp to come after him, and I don't love them any better than him. There's no reason why I should keep the meat from him, only for them. It's the natur of the beast to want its fill, and what the wild-cat don't eat the buzzards must. The varmint won't touch him so long as he can move a finger, and when he can't he won't mind much how many of 'em get at him.” So speaking, he turned from the animal to the maniac. The hand was uplifted no longer. The eye had nothing of life's language in it. The last lingering consciousness had departed for ever; and Blonay looked up to the watching wild-cat as he turned the body with his foot, muttering aloud as he did so—“Adrat it, you may soon come down to dinner.” The animal uttered a short, shrill cry, two or three times repeated, and with a rising of its bristles, and such a flashing of its eyes, that Blonay half determined to shoot it where it stood, for what appeared to him its determined insolence. Once, indeed, he did lift his rifle, but, with the thought of a moment, he again dropped it. “It's only a waste,” he muttered to himself, “and can do no good. Besides, it's a chawed bullet. It's of no use to bite lead when a wild-cat's to be killed. Smooth bullet and smooth bore will do well enough, and them I hain't.” Such were his words as he turned away from the spot, and departed for the place where his horse was fastened, —such was his philosophy. The bullet, marked for vengeance by the impression of his teeth, was not to be thrown away upon mere pastime; and, though feeling a strong desire to destroy the cat, he was yet able to forbear. He hurried through the quagmire, but had not gone far when the repeated screams of the animal, calling probably to its fellows, announced to the Half-Breed that he had already begun to exult in the enjoyment of his long withheld and human banquet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. Blonay emerged from the swamp only to commence a journey of new difficulties, the termination of which he could not foresee. Leaving him upon the road for a while, we will now change the scene to that beautiful tract of country lying close along the borders of the Santee, and stretching thence, in a northwardly direction, across the present district of Williamsburg to the river Kaddipah—a stream which, according to modern usage, has shared the fate of most of our Indian waters, and exchanging that more euphonious title, conferred upon it by the red man, is now generally known to us as Lynch's Creek. With a patriotic hardihood, that will be admitted to have its excuse if not its necessity, we choose to preserve in our narrative the original Indian cognomen whenever we may find it necessary to refer to it; and the reader, whose geographical knowledge might otherwise become confused, will henceforward be pleased to hold the two names as identical, if not synonymous. To the Santee, extending from point to point in every direction leading to the Kaddipah, the action of the Carolina partisans was for a long time limited. Our narrative will be confined within a like circuit. The entire region for nearly two hundred miles on every hand was in the temporary and occasional occupation of Marion and his little band. With the commission of the state, B 3 conferring upon him the rank of a brigadier in its service, Governor Rutledge had assigned to the brave partisan the entire charge in and over all that immense tract comprehended within a line drawn from Charleston along the Atlantic to Georgetown, inclusive,—thence in a westerly direction to Camden, and thence in another line, including the Santee river, again to Charleston. This circuit comprehended the most wealthy and populous portion of the state, and could not, under existing circumstances, have been intrusted to better hands. And yet, not a foot of it but was in actual possession and under the sway of the invader. His forts and garrisons at moderate intervals covered its surface, and his cavalry, made up chiefly of foreign and native mercenaries, constantly traversed the entire space lying between them. The worthy governor of South Carolina, thus liberal in appropriating this extensive province to the care of the partisan, dared not himself set foot upon it unless under cover of the night; and the brave man to whom he gave it availed himself of the privileges of his trust only by stratagem and stealth. Fortunately, the physical nature of the country so bestowed was well susceptible of employment in the hands of such a warrior as Marion. It afforded a thousand natural and almost inaccessible retreats, with the uses of which the partisan had been long familiar. The fastnesses of river and forest, impervious to the uninitiated stranger, were yet a home to the “swamp fox.' He doubled through them, night and day, to the continual discomfiture and mortification of his pursuers. From the Santee to the Black river, from Black river to the two Peedees, through the Kaddipah, from thence to Waccamah, and back again to the Santee, he led his enemies a long chase, which wearied out their patience, defied their valour, and eluded all their vigilance. Availing himself of their exhaustion, he would then suddenly turn upon the pursuing parties, watch their movements, await the moment of their neglect or separation, and cut them up in detail by an unlooked-for blow, which would amply compensate by its consequences for all the previous annoyance to which he might have been subjected in the pursuit. It was to his favourite retreat at Snow's Island that Major Singleton followed his commander after the successful onslaught at Dorchester. Himself familiar with the usual hiding-places, he had traced his general with as much directness as was possible in following one so habitually cautious as Marion. He had succeeded in uniting with him, though after much difficulty; and, as the partisan studiously avoided remaining very long in any one place, the union had scarcely been effected before the warriors were all again in motion for the upper Santee. This river, bold, broad, rapid, and full of intricacies, afforded the finest theatre for the sort of warfare which they carried on. Its course, too, was such as necessarily made it one of the great leading thoroughfares of the state. Detachments of the enemy's troops were continually passing and repassing it, in their progress either for the seacoast or the interior. Supplies and recruits to Cornwallis—then in North Carolina — despatches and prisoners in return from him to the Charleston garrison, made the region one of continual life, and, to Marion, of continual opportunity. Hanging around its various crossing-places like some vigilant and vengeful hawk in confident expectation of his prey, he kept an unsleeping watch, an untiring wing, an unerring weapon. In its intricacies we shall find him now—the swamps not less his home than the element of his peculiar genius. His scouts are dispersed around him in all directions and in all disguises—lying in the bush by the wayside—crouching in the oozy mire in close neighbourhood with the reptile—watchful above, and buried in the thick overhanging branches of the tree—crawling around the cottage enclosure, in readiness and waiting for the foe. The scene to which we would now direct the eye of our reader is sufficiently attractive of itself to secure his attention. The country undulates prettily around us, for miles, in every direction: now rising gently into slopes, that spread themselves away in ridges and winding lines, until the sight fails to discover the valleys in which they lose themselves—and now sinking abruptly into deepening hollows and the quietest dells, whose recesses and sudden windings, thickly covered with the massive and umbrageous natural growth of the region, terminate at last, as by a solid wall, the long and variously-shadowed prospect. On the one hand a forest of the loftiest pines, thousands upon thousands in number, lies in the deep majesty of unappropriated silence. In the twilight of their dense and sheltered abodes, the meditative and melancholy mind might fitly seek, and readily obtain, security from all obtrusion of uncongenial objects. Even the subtile and oppressive beams of the August sun come as it were by stealth, and tremblingly, into their solemn and sweet recesses. Their tops, gently waving beneath the pressure of the slight breeze as it hurries over them, yield a strain of murmuring song like the faint notes of some spirit mourner, which accords harmoniously with the sad influence of their dusky forms. The struggling and stray glance of sunlight, gliding along their prostrated vistas, rather contributes to increase than remove the sweet gloom of these deep abodes. The dim ray, like an intrusive presence, flickering between their huge figures with every movement of the declining sun, played, as it were, by stealth, among the brown leaves and over the gray bosom of the earth below. Far as the eye can extend, these vistas, so visited, spread themselves away in fanciful sinuosities, until the mind becomes unconsciously and immeasurably uplifted in the contemplation of the scene, and we feel both humbled and elevated as we gaze upon the innumerable forms of majesty before us, rising up, it would seem, without a purpose, from the bosom of the earth— living without notice and without employ—uncurbed in their growth—untroubled in their abodes—and perishing away in season only to give place to succeeding myriads having a like fortune. On the other hand, as it were, to relieve the mind of the spectator from the monotonous influence of such a survey, how different is the aspect of the woods—how various the other features of the scene around us. Directly opposed to the pine groves on the one hand, we behold the wildest and most various growth of the richest southern region rising up, spreading and swelling around in the most tangled intricacy—in the most luxurious strength. There the hickory and gum among the trees attest the presence of a better soil for cultivation, and delight the experienced eye of the planter. With these, clambering over their branches, come the wild vines, with their thorny arms and glowing vegetation. Shrubs gather in the common way; dwarf trees and plants, choked and overcome, yet living still, attest the fruitfulness of a land which yields nutriment but denies place; and innumerable species of fungi, the yellow and the purple fringes of the swamps, the various mosses, as various in hue as in form and texture—parasites that have no root, and, like unselfish affections, only claim an object upon which to bestow themselves— these, crowding about and clustering in gay confusion along the dense mass, swelling like a fortress before the eye, seem intended to form a labyrinthine retreat for the most coy of all selfish creations. Immediately beyond this dense and natural thicket, the scene—still the same—presents us with another aspect. A broken and dismantled fence, the rails half rotten and decaying fast on all sides, seems to indicate the ancient employment of the place by man. The period must have been remote, however, as the former product of the spot thus enclosed had been superseded by the small-leafed or field pine-tree, in sufficient size 4 and number almost to emulate the neighbouring and original forest. There was little here of undergrowth, and yet, as the pine thus occupying it is of inferior and frequently of dwarf size, the thicket was sufficiently dense for temporary concealment. It had a farther advantage in this respect, as it sunk rapidly in sundry places into hollows, that lay like so many cups in the bosom of crowding hills, and had for their growth, like the original wood we have just passed over, a tangled covering of vines and shrubbery. It was on the side of one of these descents, about noon, on the third day after Blonay's departure from Dorchester, that we find two persons reclining, sheltered by a clump of the smaller pines of which we have spoken, and sufficiently concealed by them and the shrubbery around, to remain unconcerned by the near proximity of the highway. The road ran along, and within rifle distance, to the south, below them. The elder of the two was a man somewhere between thirty and forty years of age. His bulky form, as it lay extended along the grass, denoted the possession of prodigious strength; though the position in which he lay, with his face to the ground, and only supported by his palms, borne up by his elbows resting upon the earth, would incline the spectator to conceive him one not often disposed for its exercise. An air of sluggish inertness marked his manner, and seemed to single him out as one of the mere beef-eaters, —the good citizens, who, so long as they get wherewithal to satisfy the animal, are not apt to take umbrage at any of the doings of the world about them. His face, however, had an expression of its own; and the sanguine flush which overspread the full cheeks, and the quick, restless movement of his blue eye, spoke of an active spirit, and one prompt enough at all times to govern and set in motion the huge bulk of that body, now so inert and sluggish. His forehead, though good, was not large; his chin was full, and his nose one of length and character. He was habited in the common blue and white homespun of the country. A sort of hunting-shirt, rather short, like a doublet, came over his hips, and was bound about his waist by a belt of the same material. A cone-crowned hat, the rim of which, by some mischance, had been torn away, lay beside him, and formed another portion of his habiliments. Instead of shoes, he wore a rude pair of buckskin moccasins, made after the Indian manner, though not with their usual skill, and which lacked here and there the aid of the needle. His shirt-collar lay open, without cravat or covering of any kind; and, by the deeply-bronzed colour of the skin beneath, told of habitual exposure to the elements. A rifle lay beside him—a stout instrument,—and in his belt a black leather case was stuck conveniently, the huge knife which it protected lying beside him, as it had just before been made subservient to his mid-day meal. His companion was a youth scarcely more than twenty years of age, who differed greatly in appearance from him we have attempted to describe. His eye was black and fiery, his cheek brown and thin, his hair of a raven black like his eye, his chin full, his nose finely Roman, and his forehead imposingly high. His person was slender, of middle height, and seemed to indicate great activity. His movements were feverishly restless —he seemed passionate and impatient, and his thin, but deeply red lips, quivered and coloured with every word and at every movement. There was more of pretension in his dress than in that of his companion, though they were not unlike in general structure and equipment. Like him he wore a hunting-shirt, but of a dark green, and it could be seen at a glance that its material had been of the most costly kind. A thick fringe edged the skirts, which came lower, in proportion to his person, than those of his companion. Loops of green cord fastened the coat to his neck in front, and a belt of black polished leather confined it to his waist. He also carried a rifle,—a Spanish dirk, with a broken handle of ivory, was stuck in his belt, and a pouch of some native fur, hanging from his neck by a green cord, contained his mould and bullets. This dress formed the uniform of a native company. His powder-horn had been well chosen, and was exceedingly and curiously beautiful. It had been ingeniously wrought in scraping down, so as to represent a rude but clear sketch of the deer in full leap, a hound at his heels, and a close thicket in the perspective, ready to receive and shelter the fugitive. These were all left in relief upon the horn, while every other part was so transparent that the several grains of powder were distinctly visible within to the eye without. The youth was partially reclining, with his back against a tree, and looking towards his elder companion. His face was flushed, and a burning spot upon both cheeks told of some vexing cause of thought which had been recently the subject of conversation between them. The features of the elder indicated care and a deep concern in the subject, whatever it may have been, but his eye was mild in its expression, and his countenance unruffled. He had been evidently labouring to sooth his more youthful comrade; and though he did not seem to have been, as yet, very successful, he did not forego his efforts in his disappointment. The conversation which followed may help us somewhat in arriving at a knowledge of the difficulty before them. “I am not more quick or impatient,” said the youth to his companion, as if in reply to some remark from the other, “than a man should be in such a case. Not to be quick when one is wronged, is to invite injustice; and I am not so young, Thumbscrew, as not to have found that out by my own experience. I know no good that comes of submission, except to make tyrants and slaves; and I tell you, Thumbscrew, that so long as my name is Mellichampe, I shall never submit to the one, nor be the other.” “A mighty fine spirit, Airnest; and, to speak what's gospel true, I likes it myself,” was the reply of the other, who addressed the first speaker with an air of respectful deference, as naturally as if he had been taught to regard him as a superior. “I'm not,” he continued, “I'm not a man myself to let another play tantrums with me; and, for sartain, I sha'n't find fault with them that's most like myself in that partic'lar. If a man says he's for fight, I'll lick him if I can;—if I can't—that's to say, if I think I can't—I'll think longer about it. I don't see no use in fighting where it's ten to one—where, indeed, it's main sartain—I'm to be licked; and so, as I says, I'll take time to think about the fighting.” “What! until you're kicked?” replied the other, impetuously. “No, no, Airnest—not so bad as that comes to, neither. My idee is, that fighting is the part of a beast-brute, and not for a true-born man, that has a respect for himself, and knows what's good-breeding; and I only fights when there's brutes standing waiting for it. Soon as a man squints at me as if he was going to play beast with me, by the eternal splinters, I'll mount him, lick or no lick, and do my best, tooth, tusk, and grinders, to astonish him. But, afore that, I'm peaceable as a pine stump, lying quiet in my own bush.” “Well, but when you're trodden upon?” said the other. “Why, then, you see, Airnest, there's another question —who's atop of me? If it's a dozen, I'll lie snug until they're gone over: I see nothing onreasonable or onbecoming in that—and that, you see, Airnest, is jist what I ax of you to do. They aint treading on you 'xactly, tho' I do confess they've been mighty nigh to it; but then, you see, there's quite too many on 'em for you to handle with, onless you play 'possum a little. There's no use to run plump into danger, like a blind bull into a thick fence, to stick fast there and be hobbled; when, if you keep your eyes open, and a keen scent, you can 4* track all your enemies, one by one, to his own kennel, and smoke 'em out, one after another, like a rabbit in a dry hollow. Hear to my words, Airnest, and don't be vexed now. Dang my buttons, you know, boy, I love you the same as if you was my own blood and bone, though I knows my place to you, and know you're come of better kin, and are better taught in book-larning; but, by God! Airnest, you haven't larned, in all your larning, to love anybody better than I love you.” “I know it, Thumby, I know it—I feel it,” said the other, moved by the earnestness of his companion, and extending his hand towards him, while his eyes filled with ready tears. “I know it—I feel it, my friend;— forgive me if I have said any thing to vex you. But my heart is full, and my blood is on fire, and I must have utterance in some way.” “Never cry, Airnest—don't, I tell you,—'taint right— it's onbecoming, Airnest, but—dang it!” he exclaimed, dashing a drop from his own eye as he spoke, “dang it! I do believe I've been about to do the same thing. But it's all the fault of one's mother, as larns it to us so strong when we're taking suck, that we 'member it for ever after. A man that's got a-fighting, and in the wars with tories one day and British the next, it's onbecoming for him to cry; and, Airnest, though things are black enough about home, it's not black enough to cry for. It'll come light again before long, I'm sartain. I've never seed the time yet when there wasn't some leetle speck of light on the edge of the cloud somewhere—it mought be ever so leetle, or ever so fur off, but it was there somewhere: it mought be in the east, and that showed the clearing away was further off; or it mought be in the northward, and that wasn't the best place either for it to break in, but it was somewhere for certain—that leetle speck of white; jist like a sort of promise from God, that airth should have sunshine again.” “Would I could behold it now,” responded the other, gloomily, to the cheering speech of his companion; “would I could behold it now; but I see nothing of this promise—there is no bright speck in the dark cloud which now hangs about my fortunes.” “You're but young yet, Airnest, and it aint time yet for you to talk so. You haven't had a full trial yet, and you're only at the beginning—as one may say, jist at the threshold of the world, and hain't quite taken your first step into it. Wait a little; and if you've had a little nonplush at the beginning, why man, I tell you, larn from it—for it's a sort of lesson, which, if you larn it well, will make you so much the wiser to get on afterward, and so much the happier when the storm blows over. Now, I don't think it so bad for them that has misfortunes from the jump. They are always the best people after all; but them that has sunshine always at first, I never yet knew one that could stand a shower. They're always worried at every thing and everybody—quarrelling with this weather, and quarrelling with that, and never able to make the most of what comes up to 'em. Hold on, Airnest—shut your teeth, and keep in your breath, and stand to it a leetle longer. That's my way; and, when I keep to it, I'm always sure to see that leetle white speck I've been telling about, wearing away all round, till it comes right before my eyes, and there it sticks, and don't move till the sunlight comes out again.” “You may be right in your philosophy,” responded the youth, “and I would that I could adopt it for my own; but my experience rejects, and my heart does not feel it. These evils have come too fast and too suddenly upon me. My father cruelly murdered—my mother driven away from the home of my ancestors—that home confiscated, and given to the murderer—and I, a hunted, and, if taken, a doomed man! It is too much for my contemplation. My blood boils, my brain burns —I cannot think, and when I do it is only to madden.” The speaker paused in deepest emotion. His hand clasped his forehead, and he sank forward, with his face prone to the earth upon which he had been reclining. His companion lifted his hand, which he took into his own, and, with a deep solicitude of manner, endeavoured, after his own humble fashion of argument and speech, to exhort his youthful and almost despairing associate to better thoughts and renewed energy. “Look up, Airnest, my dear boy,—look up, and listen to me, Airnest. It's onbecoming to be cast down like a woman, because trouble presses upon the heart. I know what trouble is, and, dang my buttons, Airnest, I feel for you all over; but I don't like to see you cast down, because then I think you aint able to turn out to have satisfaction upon the enemy for what they've done to you. Now, though I do say you're to keep quiet, and lie snug at the present, that isn't to say that you're to do nothing. No, no,—you're to get in readiness for what's to come, and not be wanting when you have a chance to turn your enemy upon his back. It aint revenge, but it's justice, and my lawful, natural right, that I fights for; and you mustn't be cast down, Airnest, seeing that then you moughtn't be ready to take the benefit of a good opportunity.” “It's revenge not less than justice,” said the youth, impatiently. “I must have the one, whether the other be obtained or not. I will have it—I will not sleep in its pursuit; and yet, Thumbscrew, I will take your advice—I will be prudent in order to be successful—I will pause in order to proceed. Do not fear me now—I shall do nothing which will risk my adventure or myself: but I will temper my mood with caution, and seek for that vengeance, which shall be the white speck among the clouds of which you have spoken.” “Well, now, that's what I call becoming, and straight-forward right. I'm for—but hush! don't you hear something like a critter? and—that was the bark of a cur, I'll be sworn to it.” The sturdy woodman thrust his ear to the earth, and the sound grew more distinct. “Keep close, Airnest, now, and I'll look out, and make an examination. There's only one horse, I reckon, from the sound; but I'll see before I leave the bush. I'll whistle should I want you to lend a hand in the business.” Seizing his rifle as he spoke, with an alacrity which seemed incompatible with his huge limbs, and must have surprised one who had only beheld him as he lay supine before, he bounded quickly, but circumspectly, up the hill, and through the copse towards the highway from whence the sounds that had startled them appeared to proceed. The cause of the disturbance may very well be reserved for explanation in another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. Before reaching the road the sturdy woodman became yet more cautious, and, stealing from cover to cover, thus eluded any eye that might be approaching upon it. He gained the cover of a little hedge, formed of the tallow-bush and myrtle, and crouched cautiously and silently out of sight, as he perceived, from the short, quick cry of the cur, that he was advancing rapidly. He had scarcely done so, and arranged an aperture in the copse through which he might observe the road, when he beheld the cause of the uproar which the dog was making. Leaping in irregular bounds, and evidently nearly exhausted, a frightened rabbit came down the trace, inclining from the opposite and open ground of pine forest, to the close bushes in which he was himself concealed. “Poor Bon,” exclaimed the woodman, “it's a bad chance for her this time. I only hope she won't pop into this quarter, or it will be a bad chance for some of her friends.” The muttered apprehensions of the woodman were realized. His eye had scarcely noted the pursuing dog, which emerged from the wood closely upon the rabbit's heels, when the poor thing rushed to the very shelter in which he stood, and, darting between his legs, was there secured by their involuntary pressure together. He stooped to the earth, and took up the trembling animal, which lay quivering in his grasp, preferring, by the natural prompting of its instinct, to trust the humanity of man rather than the well-known nature of the enemy which had pursued it. “Poor Bonny,” said the woodman, soothingly, as he caressed it. “Poor Bon—you couldn't help it, Bonny —you were too mighty frightened to know the mischief you're a-doing. Ten to one you've got us into a hobble, now; but there's nothing to be done but to see it out.” The dog by this time rushed into the brush, and recoiled instantly as he beheld the stranger. The quick, rapid cry with which he had pursued the rabbit, was exchanged for the protracted bark with which he precedes his assault upon the man. His white teeth were displayed, and, as if conscious of approaching support, he advanced boldly enough to the attack. The woodman grew a little angry, and lifting his rifle in one hand, while maintaining the terrified but quiet rabbit in the other, he made an exhibition of it which prompted the cur to give back. It was then that, through the bushes, he saw a person approaching along the road whom he readily took to be the owner of the dog. He dropped his rifle instantly, which he suffered to rest, out of sight, against a tree which stood behind him; and, hallooing to the new-comer, he advanced without hesitation from his place of concealment into the road. Blonay—for it was he—drew up his tacky, and the rifle which he carried across the saddle, in his hand, was grasped firmly, and, at the first moment, was partially uplifted; but, seeing that the stranger was unarmed, he released his hold, and saluted him with an appearance of as much good-humour as he could possibly put on. Thumbscrew advanced to him with the trembling rabbit, which he made the subject of his first address. “How are you, stranger? I reckon this is some of your property that I've got here—seeing as how your dog started it. I cotched it 'twixt my legs—the poor thing was so scared, it didn't know—not it—that 'twas going out of the frying-pan into the fire. It's your'n now; though, dang it, stranger, if so be you don't want it much, I'd rether now you'd tell me to put it down in the bush and let it run, while you make your dog hold in. It's so scared, you see, and it's a pity to hurt any thing in natur when you see it scared.” He patted the feeble and trembling animal encouragingly as he spoke, and Blonay was surprised that so large a man should be so gently inclined. He himself cared little, at any time, about the feelings and the fears of yet larger objects. His reply to the application for mercy was favourable, however. “Well, if you choose, my friend, you can let it go. I don't want it. The dog only started it for his own fun, seeing that it's the nature of the beast. Here, Hitch'em, Hitch'em! lie down, nigger—and shut up. You can let her go now, my friend.” Blonay quieted his dog, and Thumbscrew took his way into cover, watched his moment, and, with a parting pat upon its back, and a cheering “hurrah Bon, run for it with your best legs,” dismissed the little captive, once more in safety, to its forest habitations. He then returned to the spot where Blonay remained in waiting, and, in his blunt, good-humoured way, at once proceeded to commence a conversation with him, after the manner of the country, with a direct question. “Well, now, stranger, you've been travelling a bit— can you tell me, now, if you've seed anywhere in your travels a man or boy that looks very much like a thief, riding upon a fine dark-bay nag, that looks like he was stolen?” “No, that I haven't, friend—I'm much obliged to you, but I haven't seen any,” was the reply of Blonay. “Well, you needn't be obliged to me, stranger, seeing it's no sarvice to you, the question I ax'd you. But if it aint axing you too much, I should like to know which road you come.” “Well, to say truth, now, my friend, I don't know the name it goes by—it's a main bad road, you see.” “I ax, you see, because, when you tells me you aint seed the nag and them that's riding him on the road you come, it's a clear chance they've gone t'other. So, now, if you'll only but say which road you tuk, I'll take the contrary.” The reasoning was so just, and the air of simplicity so complete, which the inquirer had put on, that Blonay saw no necessity for keeping concealed so unimportant a matter as the mere route which he had been travelling; so, without any farther scruple, he gave the required information. “Well, then, I reckon, stranger, you're all the way from the big city, clear down to the salt seas. There's a power of people there now, aint there?” “I aint from Charleston,” coldly replied the Half-Breed. “Oh, you aint—but, do tell—you hear'd about a man that was hung at Dorchester—reckon you seed it?” “He worn't hung—he got off.” “What! they pardoned him—and so many people as was guine to see him dance upon nothing? What a disappointment! I was a-guine down myself, but, you see, I lost my critter, and so I couldn't; and now I'm glad I didn't, if so be, as you say, he worn't hung.” “No, he worn't hung—there was a fight, and he got away. But this is only what they tell me; I don't know myself.” “Who tell'd you?” “The people.” “What, them that seed it? Perhaps them that did it —eh?” This was pushing the matter quite too far, and Blonay began to be uneasy under so leading a question. He replied quickly, after the evasive manner which was adopted between them, “No! I don't know, they told me they heard it, and I didn't ax much about it, for it worn't my business, you see.” “Oh! that's right,—everybody to his own business, says I; and, where people's a-fighting, clean hands and long distance is always best for a poor man and a stranger. They gits a-fighting every now and then in these here parts, and they do say they're a mustering now above, the sodgers.” “What soldiers?” demanded Blonay, with an air of interest. “Eh! what sodgers?—them that carries guns and swords, and shoots people, to be sure—them's sodgers, aint they?” “Yes! but have they got on uniforms, or is it only them that carries rifle, or a knife, or perhaps a rusty sword, or a hatchet. Some soldiers, you know, has fine boots and shoes, with shining buttons, and high caps and feathers; and some haint got shoes, and hardly breeches.” Blonay had become the examiner, and had begun with a leading question also. He had fairly described the British and tory troops in his enumeration of the one, and the rebels, or whigs, in the description of the latter class. The former were usually well provided with arms, ammunition, and every necessary warlike equipment;—the whigs were simply riflemen, half the time Vol. I.—C 5 without powder and lead, and, during the greater part of the war, without necessary clothing. To tell Blonay which of these two classes was in the neighbourhood, was no part of Thumbscrew's policy; and his reply, though unsatisfactory, was yet given with the most off-handed simplicity. “They're all the same to me, stranger, breeches or no breeches, boots or no boots, high caps and feathers, or a ragged steeple like mine—they're all the same to me. A sodger's a sodger—any man that can put a bullet into my gizzard, or cut me a slash over my cheek, up and down, without any marcy for my jaw-bone—he's a sodger for me, and I gits out of his way mighty soon now when I hear of his coming. It's a bad business that, stranger, and I hope you don't deal in it. I say I hope so, for I don't like to see a man I may say I know, chopped up and down, and bored through his head, or his belly, without any axing, and perhaps onbeknown to him.” No interest could be, seemingly, so earnest, as that which Thumbscrew manifested, as he thus expressed his anxiety on the score of Goggle's connexion with the military. He put his hand warmly, as he spoke, upon the neck of the little tacky which the other bestrode —a movement which the rider did not seem very greatly to approve, as he contrived, in the next moment, by a sudden jerk, to wheel the animal away from the grasp of the stranger, and to present himself once more in front of him. Thumbscrew did not appear to charge the movement so much upon the rider as the horse. “Well, now, stranger, your nag is mighty skittish. It's a stout pony that, and smells, for all the world, as if it had fed on cane-tops and salt-marsh all its life. Talking about horses, now, I've hear'd say that they were getting mighty scarce down in your parts, where the troops harry them with hard riding. Some say that they were buying and stealing all they could, to bring troops up into this quarter. You aint hear'd any say about it, I reckon?” The inquiry was adroitly insinuated, but Blonay was not to be caught, even had he been in possession of the desired information. He availed himself of the question, however, to suggest another, by which, had his companion been less guarded, he might have discovered to which party he belonged. “What troops?” he asked, carelessly. “Why, them that fights, to be sure. Troops, if I'm rightly told, is them men that rides on horseback, and fights with swords and pistols, and the big cannon.” “Yes, troopers,” said Blonay, tired, seemingly, of putting questions so unprofitably answered. “Ay—troopers, is it?—I always called them troops But you aint telled me if they're coming in these parts. You aint seed any on the road, I reckon?—for you aint hurt, that I can see. But, maybe you out-travelled 'em —they shot at you, though?” The volubility of Thumbscrew carried him so rapidly on in his assumptions, that it was with difficulty Blonay kept himself sufficiently reserved in his communications. He was at some pains, however, to assure him that he had neither seen any troops, nor been pursued, nor shot at by them. That his whole journey hitherto had been unmarked by any other adventure of more importance than the catching of the single rabbit, in which Thumbscrew had himself so largely assisted. This reference drew the attention of Thumbscrew to the ragged and mean-looking cur that followed the stranger. He admired him exceedingly, and, at length, proceeded to ask —“Won't you trade him, now, stranger? I want a hunting-dog mightily.” Blonay declined, and was so pleased and satisfied with the simplicity of his new acquaintance, that he ventured to ask some direct questions, taking care, however that none of them should convey any committal of his E C 2 sentiments. He stated, for himself, that he was on his way to Black river and the Santee—that he was looking after a person who was indebted to him—that he was a peaceable man, and wanted to get on without fighting, and he was therefore desirous of avoiding all combatants. In order to do this, he would like to know where Gainey's men were (tories), and Marion's men—if they were likely to lie in his way by pursuing such and such routes, all of which he named, and seemed to know, and how he should best avoid them. In making these inquiries, Blonay had well adopted the manner of one solicitous for peace, and only desirous of getting to the end of his journey without difficulty or adventure. In referring to the different leaders of the two parties in that section of country, he took especial care, at the same time, to utter no word, and exhibit no look or gesture, which could convey the slightest feeling of partiality or preference, on his part, for either; and all that Thumbscrew could conjecture from the inquiry, supposing that the traveller was disguising the truth, was, that, so far from his wishing to avoid all of these parties, by obtaining a knowledge of their lurking-places, he was rather in search of one or the other of them. His scrutiny failed utterly when he strove to find out which. He did not long delay to answer these inquiries, which he did in the unsatisfactory fashion of all the rest. “Well, now, stranger, you ax a great deal more than I have to answer. These here people that you talk about, I hear, every day, something or other said of them, but nothing very good, now, either way. It's now one, and now another of them that shoots the poor folk's cattle, and maybe shoots them too, and there's no help for it. Sometimes Guiney's people run over the country, burning and plundering—then Marion's men comes after, burning and plundering what's left. So that, between the two, honest, quiet, good-natured sort of people, like you and me, stranger—we get the worst of it, and must cut strap and take the brush, rather than lose life with property. It's a sad time, now, stranger, I tell you.” “But you aint heard of either of 'em in these parts lately, have you?” inquired Blonay. “Dang it, stranger, they're here, there, and everywhere: they're never long missing from any one place, and—dang my buttons! I think I hear some of them coming now.” Thumbscrew turned as he spoke, and appeared to listen. Sounds, as of horses' feet, were certainly approaching, and perceptible to Blonay not less than to his dog. With the confirmation of his conjecture, the woodman turned quickly to the forest cover, and, shaking his head, cried to his companion, as he bounded into its depths— “Look to yourself, stranger, for, as sure as a gun, some of them sodgers is a-coming. They'll shoot you through the body, and chop you into short meat, if you don't cut for it.” He disappeared on the instant, but not in flight. His purpose was to mislead Blonay, and it was sufficient for this that he simply removed himself from sight. Keeping the edge of the forest, as close to the road as he well might, to avoid discovery from it, he now chose himself a station from which he might observe the approaching horsemen, and, at the same time, remain in safety. This done, he awaited patiently their approach. His late companion, in the meanwhile, whose policy was a like caution, quickly followed the suggestion and example of the woodman, and sank into the forest immediately opposite that which the latter had chosen for his shelter. Here he imbowered himself in the woods sufficiently far for concealment, and, hiding his horse, and placing his dog in watch over him, he advanced on foot within a stone's cast from the road, to a spot commanding a good view of every thing upon it. Here, in deep silence, he also stood—a range of trees between his person and that of the approaching horsemen, and 5* his form more immediately covered by the huge body of a pine, from behind which he occasionally looked forth in scrutinizing watchfulness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. The two watchers had not long to wait in their several places of concealment. The sound which had disturbed their conference, and sent them into shelter, drew nigher momentarily, and a small body of mounted men, emerging at length from a bend in the irregular road over which they came, appeared in sight. They were clothed in the rich, gorgeous uniform of the British army, and were well mounted. Their number, however, did not exceed thirty, and their general form of advance and movement announced them to be less thoughtful, at that moment, of the dangers of ambuscade and battle, than of the pleasant cheer and well-filled larder of the neighbouring gentry. Two officers rode together, in advance of them some little distance, and the free style of their conversation, the loud, careless tones of their voices, and the lounging, indifferent manner in which they sat upon their horses, showed them to be, if not neglectful of proper precautions, at least perfectly unapprehensive of any enemy. A couple of large military wagons, drawn each by four able-bodied horses, appeared in the centre of the cavalcade, the contents of which, no doubt, were of sufficient importance to call for such a guard. Yet there was little or nothing of a proper military discipline preserved in the ranks of the troop. Following the example of the officers who commanded them, and who seemed, from their unrestrained mirth, to be engaged in the disoussion of some topic particularly agreeable to both, the soldiers gave a loose to the playfullest moods— wild jest and free remark passed from mouth to mouth, and they spoke, and looked, and laughed, as if their trade was not suffering, and its probable termination a bloody death. Their merriment, however, as it was subdued, in comparison with that of the officers, did not provoke their notice or rebuke. The whole party, in all respects, seemed one fitted out for the purposes of pleasure rather than of war. Elated by the recent victories of Cornwallis over Gates, and Tarleton over Sumter, together with the supposed flight of Marion into North Carolina, and the dispersion of his partisans, the British officers had foregone much of that severe, but proper discipline, through which alone they had already been able to achieve so much. The commander of the little troop before us moved on with as much indifference as if enemies had ceased to exist, and as if his whole business now was the triumph and the pageant which should follow successes so complete. “Gimini!” exclaimed Thumbscrew, as he beheld, at a distance, their irregular approach. “Gimini! if the major was only here now, jist with twenty lads only— twenty would do—maybe he wouldn't roll them red-jackets in the mud!” The close approach of the troop silenced the farther speculations of the woodman, and he crouched among the shrubbery, silent as death, but watchful of every movement. The person of the captain who commanded them was rather remarkable for its strength than symmetry. He was a man of brawn and muscle—of broad shoulders and considerable height. His figure was unwieldy, however, and, though a good, he was not a graceful horseman. His features were fine, but inexpressive, and his skin brown with frequent exposure. There was something savage rather than brave in the expression of his mouth, and his nose, in addition to its exceeding feebleness, had an ugly bend upwards at its termination, which spoke of a vexing and querulous disposition. His companion was something slenderer in his person, and considerably more youthful. There was nothing worthy of remark in his appearance, unless it be that he was greatly given to laughter—an unprofitable habit, which seemed to be irresistible and confirmed in him, and which was not often found to await the proper time and provocation. He appeared of a thoughtless temper—one who was content with the surfaces of things, and did not disturb the waters with a discontented spirit, seeking for more pleasure than the surface gave him. At the moment of their approach the good-humour of the two was equally shared between them. The subject upon which they had been conversing appeared to have been productive of no small degree of merriment to both, and of much undisguised satisfaction to the elder. He chuckled with uncontrollable complacency, and, long after the laugh of his companion had ceased, a lurking smile hung upon his lips, that amply denoted the still lingering thought of pleasure in his mind. Though ignorant of the occasion of their mirth before, we may now, as they approach, hear something of the dialogue, which was renewed after a brief pause between them; and which, though it may not unfold to us the secret of their satisfaction, may at least inform us, in some degree, of much that is not less necessary for us to know. The pause was broken by the younger of the two, whose deferential and conciliatory manner, while it spoke the inferior, was, at the same time, dashed with a phrase of fireside familiarity, which marked the intimacy of the boon companion. “And now, Barsfield, you may laugh at fortune for ever after. You have certainly given her your defiance, and have triumphed over her aversion. You have beaten your enemy, won your commission, found favour in the sight of your commander, and can now sit down to the performance of a nominal duty, with a fine plantation, and a stout force of negroes, all at your command and calling you master. By St. George and the old dragon himself, I should be willing that these rebels should denounce me too as a tory, and by any other nickname, for rewards like these.” “They may call me so if they think proper,” said the other, to whom the last portion of his comrade's remark seemed to be scarcely welcome; “but, by God! they will be wise not to let me hear them. I have had that name given me once already by that insolent boy, and I did not strike him down for it—he may thank his good fortune and the interposition of that fellow Witherspoon that I did not—but it will be dangerous for any living man to repeat the affront.” “And why should you mind it, Barsfield?” responded his companion. “It can do you no mischief—the term is perfectly innocuous. It breaks no skin—it takes away no fortune.” “No! but it sticks to a man like a tick, and worries him all his life,” said the other. “Only with your thin-skinned gentry. For such an estate as yours, Barsfield, they might be licensed to call me by any nickname which they please.” “I am not so indulgent, Lieutenant Clayton,” replied the other; “and, let me tell you, that you don't know the power of a nickname among enemies. A nickname is an argument, and one of that sort, too, that, after once hearing it, the vulgar are sure never to listen to any other. It has been of no small influence already in this same war—and it will be of greater effect towards the conclusion, if it should ever so happen that the war should terminate unfavourably to the arms of his majesty.” “But you don't think any such result possible?” was the immediate reply of Clayton. “No—not now. This last licking of Sumter, and the wholesale defeat of Gates, have pretty well done up the rebels in this quarter. Georgia has been long shut C 3 up, and North Carolina will only wake up to find her legs fastened. As for Virginia, if Cornwallis goes on at the present rate, he'll straddle her quite in two weeks more. No! I think that rebellion is pretty nigh wound up; and, if we can catch the `swamp fox,' or find out where he hides, I'll contrive that we shall have no more difficulty from him.” “Let that once take place,” replied his companion, “and you may then retire comfortably, in the enjoyment of the otium cum dignitate, the reward of hard fighting and good generalship, to the shady retreats of `Kaddipah.' By-the-way, Barsfield, you must change that name to something modern—something English. I hate these abominable Indian names—they are so uncouth, and so utterly harsh and foreign in an English ear. We must look up a good name for your settlement.” “You mistake. I would not change the name for the world. I have always known the place by that name, long before I ever thought to call it mine; and the name sounds sweet in my ears. Besides, I like these Indian names, of which you so much complain. They sound well, and are always musical.” “They are always harsh to me, and then they have no meaning—none that we know any thing about.” “And those that we employ have as little. They are generally borrowed from individuals who were their proprietors, and this is the case with our Indian names, which have the advantage in softness and emphasis. No! `Kaddipah Thicket' shall not lose its old name in gaining a new owner. It wouldn't look to me half so beautiful if I were to give it any other. I have rambled over its woods when a boy, and hunted through them when a man, man and boy, for thirty years—known all its people, and the name seems to be a history, and brings to me a whole world of recollections, which I should be apt to lose were I to change it.” “Some of them, Barsfield, it appears to me that you should prefer to lose. The insult of old Mellichampe, for example.” “I revenged it!” was the reply, quickly and gloomily uttered. “I revenged it in his blood, and the debt is paid.” “But the son?—did you not, only now, complain of him also?—did he not call you—” “Tory! I'll finish the sentence for you, as I would rather, if the word is to be repeated in my ears, have the utterance to myself. You are an Englishman, and the name does not and cannot be made to apply to you here, and you cannot understand, therefore, the force of its application from one American to another. He called me a tory! denounced, defied, and struck at me, and I would have slain him—ay, even in the halls which are henceforward to call me master—but that I was held back by others, whose prudence, perhaps, saved the lives of both of us; for the strife would have been pell-mell, and that fellow Witherspoon, who was the overseer of old Mellichampe, had a drawn knife ready over my shoulder, at the moment that mine was lifted at the breast of the insolent youngster. But this is a long story, and you already know it. I have been revenged on the father, and have my debt against the son—that shall be cancelled also, in due course of time.” “And where is the youngster now, Barsfield? Have you any knowledge of his movements?” “None—his mother has fled to the Santee, where she is sheltered by Watson. But of the son I know nothing. He is not with her, that's certain; for Evans, whom I sent off in that direction as a sort of scout and watch over her, reports that he has not yet made his appearance.” “He must be out with Marion, then?” was the suggestion of the other. “We shall soon see that, for our loyalists are all ready and earnest for a drive after the `fox;' and it will be a close swamp that will keep him away from hunters such as ours. These arms will provide two hundred of them, and we have full that number ready to volunteer. In a week more I hope to give a good account of his den, and all in it.” While this dialogue was going on, the speakers continued to approach the spot where Thumbscrew lay in hiding. It was not long, as they drew nigh, before he distinguished the person of Barsfield, and a fierce emotion kindled in his eye as he looked out from his shelter upon the advancing figure of the successful tory. His whole frame seemed agitated with the quickening rush of the warm blood through his veins—his teeth were gnashed for a moment fiercely, and, freeing a way through the bushes for his rifle-muzzle, in the first gush of his excited feelings, he lifted the deadly weapon to his eye, brought back the cock with the utmost precaution, avoiding any unnecessary click, and prepared to plant the fatal bullet in the head of the unconscious victim. But the tory rode by unharmed. A gentler, or, at least, a more prudent feeling, got the better of the woodman's momentary mood of passion; and, letting the weapon fall quietly into the hollow of his arm, he muttered in a low tone to himself— “Not yet, not yet—let him pass—let him git on as he can. It ain't time yet—he must have a little more swing for it before I bring him up, for 'tain't God's pleasure that I should drop him now. I don't feel like it, and so I know it can't be right. It's a cold-blooded thing, and looks too much like murder; and, God help me, it ain't come to that yet, for Jack Witherspoon to take it out of his enemy's hide without giving him fair play for it. Let him go—let him go. Ride on, Barsfield; the bullet's to be run yet that bothers you.” And, thus muttering to himself, the woodman beheld his victim pass by him in safety, his troop and wagons following. He was about to turn away and seek his comrade in the wood, when he saw his travelling acquaintance, Blonay, emerge from the opposite quarter, and place himself before the British officers. This movement at once satisfied the doubts of Thumbscrew as to the politics of the low-countryman. “As I thought,” said he to himself, “the fellow's a skunk, and a monstrous sly one. He knows how to badger, and can beat the bush like a true scout. It's a God's pity that a fellow that has good qualities like that, shouldn't have soul enough to be an honest man. But no matter—pay-day will come for all; and truth will have to wait in the swamp till cunning can go help her out.” Thus moralizing, the woodman went back from his hiding-place, and soon joined his now impatient companion. Blonay, in the meanwhile, had made the acquaintance of the British party. Confirmed by their uniform, he boldly advanced, and presented himself before the captain. “Who the devil are you?” was the uncourteous salutation. A grin and a bow, with a few mumbled words, was the sort of reply manifested by the Half-Breed, who followed up this overture by the presentation of the passport furnished by Proctor. Barsfield read the scroll, and threw it back to him. “And so you are going our way, I see by your paper. It is well—you will prefer, then, falling in with us, and taking our protection?” Blonay bowed assent, and muttered his acknowledgments. “And, perhaps,” continued the tory captain, “as you are a true friend to his majesty's cause, you will not object to a drive into the swamps along with us after these men of Marion, who are thought to be lurking about here?” 6 The Half-Breed gave his ready assurance of a perfect willingness to do so. “Well said, my friend; and now tell us, Mr. Blonay, what have been your adventures upon the road? What have you seen deserving of attention since you came into this neighbourhood?” The person addressed did not fail to relate all the particulars of his meeting, but a little before, with the woodman, as the reader has already witnessed it. Barsfield listened with some show of attention, and only interrupted the narrator to ask for a description of the stranger's person. This was given, and had the effect of producing an expression of earnest thought in the countenance of the listener. “Very large, you say—broad about the shoulders? And you say he went into this wood?” “Off there, cappin, close on to them bays, and in them bushes.” Barsfield looked over into the thick-set and seemingly impervious forest, and saw at a glance how doubtful and difficult would be the pursuit, in such a place, even were the object important, of a single man. After a momentary pause of action and speech, he gave orders suddenly to move on in the path they were pursuing. Taking the direction of his finger, Blonay fell behind, and was soon mingled in with the party that followed. “You shall see my fair neighbour,” said the tory captain to his companion, when the party resumed its progress, as if in continuation of the previous discourse; “she is as beautiful and young, Clayton, as she is pure and intellectual. She is the prize, dearer and richer than all of my previous attainment, for which I would freely sacrifice them all. You shall see her, and swear to what I have said.” “You will make her your own soon, then, I imagine,” said the other, “esteeming her so highly.” “If I can—be sure of it,” responded Barsfield. “I will try devilish hard for it, I assure you; and it will be devilish hard indeed, if, with a fine plantation, and no little power—with a person which, though not superb, is at least passable”—and the speaker looked down upon his own bulky frame with some complacency—“it will be devilish hard, I say, if I do not try successfully. Her old father, too, will back me to the utmost, for he is devilish scary, and, being a good loyalist, is very anxious to have a son-in-law who can protect his cattle from the men of Marion. They have half frightened him already into consent, and have thus done me much more service than they ever intended.” “But your maiden herself, the party chiefly concerned?” said Clayton, inquiringly. “She fights shy, and does not seem over-earnest to listen to my courtier speeches; but she is neither stern nor unapproachable, and, when she replies to me, it is always gently and sweetly.” “Then she is safe, be sure of it,” was the sanguine response of the other. “Not so,” said the more sagacious Barsfield; “not so. I am not so well satisfied that because she is gentle she will be yielding. She cannot be otherwise than gentle—she cannot speak otherwise than sweetly, even though her words be those of denial. I would rather a cursed sight that she should wince a little, and tremble when I talk to her; for then I should know that she was moved with an interest one way or the other. Your cool, composed sort of woman is not to be surprised into any foolish weakness. They must listen long, and like to listen, before you can do any thing with them. But you shall see her soon, for here her father's fields commence. A fine clearing, you see, and the old buck is tolerably well off—works some eighty hands, and has a stock would fit out a dozen Scotch graziers.” Thus discussing the hopes and expectations which make the aim and being of the dissolute adventurer, they pricked their way onward with all speed to the dwelling of those who were to be the anticipated victims.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. Slowly, and with an expression of sorrow in his countenance, corresponding with the unelastic and measured movement of his body, Thumbscrew took his way back to the hollow where he had left his more youthful companion. “Well, what have you seen to keep you so long, Thumbscrew?” was the impatient inquiry of the youth. The answer of the woodman to this interrogatory was hesitatingly uttered, and he first deliberately told of his encounter with Blonay, and the nature of the unsatisfactory dialogue which had taken place between them. He dwelt upon the cunning with which the other had kept his secret during the conference; “but I found him out at last,” said he, “and now I knows him to be a skunk —a reg'lar built tory, as I mought ha' known from the first moment I laid eyes on him.” “Well—and where is he now, and how did you discover this?” was the inquiry of the other. This inquiry necessarily unfolded the intelligence concerning the troop of horse, whose number, wagons, and equipments he gave with all the circumspectness and fidelity of an able scout; and this done, he was silent; with the air, however, of one who has yet something to unfold. “But who commanded them, Thumbscrew?” asked the other, “and what appeared to be their object? You are strangely limited in your intelligence, and, at this rate, will hardly justify the eulogy of Major Singleton, who considers you the very best scout in the brigade. Can you tell us nothing more? What sort of captain had they?” “A stout fellow, quite as broad, but not so tall as me, with a skin brown, like mine, as a berry; a hook nose, and a mouth more like the chop of a broad-axe than any thing else.” He paused, and the eyes of the scout and those of his young comrade met. There was a quickening apprehension of the truth in those of Mellichampe, which made them kindle with successive flashes, while his mouth, partaking of the same influence, quivered convulsively, as, bending forward to his more sedate companion, he demanded, with a stern, brief manner— “You are not speaking of Barsfield, surely?” “I am—that's the critter, or I'm no Christian.” The youth seized his rifle as he replied—“And you shot him not down!—you suffered him to pass you in safety!—my father's blood yet upon his hands—unavenged—and he going now, doubtless, to reap the reward of his crime and perfidy! But he cannot have gone far—he must be yet within reach, and, by the eternal! he shall not escape me now. Hold me not back, Thumbscrew—hold me not back! I deem you no friend of mine that suffered the wretch to pass on in safety, and I shall deem you still less my friend if you labour to restrain me now. Hold me not, I tell you, Witherspoon, or it will be worse for you.” The youth, as he spoke, leaped upon his feet in a convulsion of passion, that seemed to set at defiance all restraint. His eyes, that before had sent forth only irregular flashes of light and impulse, were now fixed in a steady, unmitigated flame, that underwent no change. Not so his lips, which quivered and paled more fitfully than ever. He strove earnestly with his strong-limbed comrade, who had grasped him firmly with the first ebullition 6* of that passion which he seemed to have anticipated. “What would you do, Airnest?—don't be foolish, now, I beg you; running your head agin a pine knot that you can't swallow. It's all foolishness to go on so, and can do no good. As to shooting that skunk, I couldn't and wouldn't do it, though I had the muzzle up, and it was a sore temptation, Airnest; for I remembered the old man, and his white hair, and it stood before my eyes jist like a picture, as I seed it last when it was thickened together with his own blood.” “Yet you could remember all this, and suffer his murderer to escape?” reiterated the other. “Yes! for it goes agin the natur of an honest man to bite a man with cold bullet when the tother ain't on his guard agin it. I'll take a shot any day with Barsfield, man to man, or where a fight's going on with a hundred, but, by dogs! I can't lie at the roadside, under a sapling, and send a bullet at him onawares as he's riding down the trace. It's an Ingen way, and it's jist as bad as any murder I've ever hearn tell of their doing. No, no, Airnest; there's a time coming! as I may say, the day of judging them's at hand; for here, you see, is this chap, going down now, snug and easy, with a small handful of troops, to take possession of Keddipah. Let him set down quietly till the `fox' gits up his men, and I'll lay you what you please we git our satisfaction out of him by fair fight. We'll smoke him out of his hole 'fore Sunday next, if I'm not monstrous wide in my calkilation.” “And where is the difference between shooting him now and shooting him then? I see none. Release me, Mr. Witherspoon,” cried the other, his anger now beginning to turn upon the tenacious Thumbscrew, who held upon his body with a grasp that set at defiance all his efforts. In the next moment he was released as he had desired, and, with a deference of manner, a subdued and even sadder visage, the countryman addressed the youth— “You're gitting into a mighty passion, Airnest, and, what's worse, you're gitting in a passion with me, that was your friend and your father's friend ever since I know'd you both, though, to be sure, I never could do much for either of you in the way of friendship.” “I am not angry with you, Witherspoon—only, I am no child to be restrained after this fashion. I know you are my friend, and, God knows! I have too few now to desire the loss of any one of them—and particularly of one who, like yourself, has clung to me in all trials; but there is a certain boundary beyond which one's best friend has no right to go.” “Oh, yes! I understand all that, Airnest. I'm your friend so long as I don't think or act contrary to your thinking and acting. Now, to my thinking, that's a bargain that will only answer for one side, and I never yet made a bargain in my life under them sort of tarms. If I sells a horse or buys one, I does it because I thinks there'll be some sort of benefit or gain to myself. I don't want to take ondue advantage of the other man, but I expects to git as good as I gives. That's the trade for me; whether it be a horse that I trades, or my good word and the heart, rough or gentle, all the same, that I bring to barter with my friend. When I makes sich a trade, I can't stand and see the man I trade with making light of the article I gives him. If it's my friendship and good word, he mustn't make them a sort of plaything, to sport which way he pleases; and, so long as I say I'm his friend, he sha'n't butt a tree if I can keep his head from it, though I have to take main force to hold him in. On them same tarms, Airnest, I stood by the old 'squire your father when he got into difficulties about the line of his land with Hitchingham; when the two got all their friends together, and fout, as one may say, like so many tiger-cats, along the rice-dam, for two long hours by sun. You've hearn tell of that excursion, I'm thinking. That was a hard brush, and I didn't skulk like a skunk then, as they will all tell you that seed it. But that worn't the only time—there was others, more than a dozen beside that, and all jist as tough, when Thumbscrew hung on to the 'squire as if he was two other legs and arms of the same body, and nobody could touch the one without touching the tother. Then came that scrape with Barsfield; and now I tell you, Airnest, it worn't a murder, as you calls it, but a fair fight, for both the parties was fairly out; and, though the old 'squire your father was surprised, and not on his proper guard, yet it was a fair-play fight, and sich as comes about, as I may say, naturally, in all our skrimmages with the tories. They licked us soundly, to be sure, 'cause they had the most men; but we fout 'em to the last, and 'twas a fair fight from the jump.” “And what of all this, now—why do you repeat this to me here?” said the other, with no little imperiousness. “Why, you see, only to show you, Airnest, as a sort of excuse and apology for what I did in trying to keep you from going after Barsfield—” “Apology, Witherspoon!” exclaimed the other. “Yes, Airnest, apology—that's the very word I makes use of. I jist wanted to show you the reason why I tuk the liberty of trying to keep an old friend's son out of harm's way, that's all. I promise you, Airnest, I won't make you angry agin, though I don't see yet the harm of liking a body so much as to do the best for 'em.” The woodman turned away as he spoke, lifted his rifle, and seemed busy in rubbing the stock of it with the sleeve of his hunting-shirt. The youth seemed touched by this simple exhortation. Without a word he approached his unsophisticated companion, whose face was turned from him, and placing his hand affectionately, with a gentle pressure, upon his shoulder, thus addressed him:— “Forgive me, Jack—I was wrong. Forgive me, and forget it. I am rash, foolish, obstinate—it's my fault, I know, to be so, and I try to control my disposition, always, when I'm with you. You know I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world. I know you love me, Jack, as if I were your own brother; and, believe me, my old friend—my father's friend—believe me, I love you fully as much. Say, now, that you forgive me—do say!” “Dang my eyes! Airnest, but, by the powers! you put it to me too hard sometimes. Jist when I'm doing the best, or trying to do the best, you plump head over heels into my teeth, and I'm forced to swallow my own doings. It ain't right—it ain't kind of you, Airnest; and, dang it, boy, I don't see why I should keep trying to do for you, to git no thanks, and little better than curses for it. I'm sure I gits nothing by sticking to you through thick and thin.” Half relenting, and prefacing his yielding mood only by this outward coating of obduracy, the woodman thus received the overtures of his companion, who was as ready to melt with generous emotion as he was to seek for strife under a fierce and impetuous one. The youth half turned away as the latter reply met his ears, and, removing his hand from the shoulder where it had rested, with a freezing tone and proud manner, he replied, while appearing to withdraw— “It is indeed time, Mr. Witherspoon, that company should part, when one reproaches the other with his poverty. You certainly have said truly, that you have nothing to gain by clinging to me and mine.” “Oh, Airnest, boy—but that's too much,” he cried, leaping round and seizing the youth's hands, while he pressed his eyes, now freely suffused, down upon them. “I didn't mean that, Airnest—I'm all over foolish to-day, and done nothing but harm. It was so from morning's first jump; I've been fooling and blundering like a squalling hen in an old woman's cupboard. Push me on one side, I'm sure to plump clear to the other end, break all the cups and dishes, and fly in the old wife's face, before I can git out. It's your turn to forgive me, Airnest, and don't say that we must cut each other. God help me, Airnest, if I was to dream of sich a thing, I'm sure your father's sperrit would haunt me, with his white hair sticking all fast with blood, and—” “No more, Jack, old fellow—let us talk no more of that, but sit down here, and say what we are to do now about that reptile, Barsfield.” “Bless you, Airnest, what can we do till the `fox' whistles? We'll have news for him to-morrow, and must only see where Barsfield goes to-night, and larn what we can of what he's going to do. I suspect that them wagons have got a plenty of guns and bagnets, shot and powder for the tories; and if so, there'll be a gathering of them mighty soon in this neighbourhood. We shall see some of the boys to-morrow—Humphries and `Roaring Dick' ride on this range, and we may hear their whistle in the `Bear Brake' before morning.” “We must meet them there, then, one or other of us, certainly. In the meantime, as you say, we must trail this Barsfield closely, and look where he sleeps, since you will not let me shoot him.” “And where's the use? I could ha' put the bullet through his scull to-day, but the next moment the dragoons would have made small work of a large man. They'd ha' chopped me into mince-meat. There's no difficulty in killing one, but small chance to git away after it, when there's so many of them upon you; and, as I said afore, this shooting a man from the bush onawares, when he's travelling in quiet, looks too much like cold-blooded Ingin murder. It's like scalping and tomahawk. Give the enemy a fair field, says I, though it be but a bow-legged nigger that's running from you in the swamp.” And, thus conferring, the two followed the route pursued by Barsfield and his party, until the shades of evening gathered heavily around them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. The British troopers, meanwhile, pursued their journey. With an humility that knew its place, Blonay followed with the hindmost, and showed no annoyance, though exposed to the continual and coarse jests of those about him. He was becomingly indifferent, as he seemed perfectly insensible. The termination of the day's journey was at length at hand. The zigzag fences rose upon both sides of the road. The negro settlement, some thirty or forty log-dwellings, forming a square to themselves, and each with its little enclosure, well stocked with pigs, poultry, and the like, came in sight; and beyond, the eager eye of Barsfield distinguished, while his hand pointed out to his companion, the fine old avenue, long, overgrown, and beautifully winding, which led to the mansion-house of the Berkeley family. “There,” said he, “is `Piney Grove'--such is the name of the estate; a name which it properly takes from the avenue which leads to it, the chief growth of which, as you will see, is the field-pine. You will not see many like it in the country.” The troop halted at the entrance, which was soon thrown open; and, narrowing the form of their advance, they were in a moment after hurrying along the shady passage which led to the hospitable dwelling. Barsfield had said rightly to his companion—there were not many avenues in the country like that which they now pursued. A beautiful and popular feature, generally, in all the old country estates of Carolina, the avenue in question was yet of peculiar design. In the lower regions, where the spreading and ponderous live-oak presents itself vigorously and freely, and seems by its magnificence and shade expressly intended for such a purpose, no other sort of tree can well be employed. Here, however, in the region which we now tread, wanting in that patriarchal tree, the field-pine had been chosen as the substitute, and nothing surely could have been more truly beautiful than the one in question. A waving and double line, carried on in sweeping and curious windings for two thirds of a mile, described by these trim and tidy trees, enclosed the party, and formed a barrier on either hand, over which no obtrusive vine or misplaced scion of some foreign stock was ever permitted to gad or wander. Some idea may be formed of the pains and care which had been taken in thus bending the free forests in subservience to the will of man, when we know that, though naturally a hardy tree of the most vigorous growth, the pine is yet not readily transplanted with success, and is so exceedingly sensitive in a strange place, as in half the number of instances to perish from such a transfer. A narrow but deep ditch formed an inner parallel line with the high trees along the avenue; and the earth, thus thrown up into a bank beneath the trees, gave ample room and nutriment to a crowded hedge of greenbrier and gathering vines, interspersed, during a long season, with a thousand various and beautiful flowers. Emerging from the avenue, the vista opened upon a lovely park, which spread away upon either hand, and was tastefully sprinkled here and there, singly and in groups, with a fine collection of massive and commanding water-oaks, from around the base of which, every thing in the guise of shrubbery and undergrowth, the thick long grass excepted, had been carefully pruned away. A few young horses were permitted to ramble about and crop the verdure on one side of the entrance, while on the other a little knot of ruminating milch-cows, to which a like privilege had been given, started up in alarm, and fled at the approach of strangers so numerous and so gorgeously arrayed. Throwing aside the heavy swinging gate before them, the troopers passed through a trace leading forward directly to the dwelling. On either side of this passage a fence of light scantling, which had once been whitewashed, proved a barrier against any trespass of the cattle upon a province not their own. The dwelling of Mr. Berkeley lay centrally before this passage and at a little distance in the rear of the park. It was an ancient mansion, of huge and clumsy brick— square and heavy in its design, though evidently well constructed. It was built about the time of the Yemassee war, after the fashion of that period, and was meant to answer the purposes of a fortress against the savage, not less than a dwelling for the civilized man. On one occasion the Edistohs had besieged it with a force of nearly two hundred warriors, but the stout planter who held it at the time, old Marmaduke Berkeley, with the aid of his neighbours, and a few trusty Irish workmen, who had been employed upon the estate, made a sturdy defence, until the friendly Indians, who were the allies of the whites, and, consequently, foes to the Edistohs, came to their relief, and beat off the invaders. The external aspect of the edifice bore sufficient testimony of its antiquity. The bricks were dark and mouldy in appearance, and the walls in several places had begun to crumble and crack beneath their own cumbrousness. Clambering parasites on the northern side had run at liberty over its surface, still holding on, even in corresponding ruin, when half withered and sapless themselves. Little tufts of dank moss protruded here and there from dusty apertures; and a close eye might even find an insidious and lurking decay thriving fast in the yielding frame which sustained this or that creaking shutter. The mansion attested not merely its own, but the decline of Vol. I.—D 7 its proprietor. A man of energy, character, and due reflection, would have found little difficulty in maintaining a resolute and successful defence against the bold assault of the tempest, or the insidious gnawings and sappings of time. The present owner, unhappily, was not this sort of man. He was prematurely old, as he had been constitutionally timid and habitually nervous. His life, so far, had passed in a feverish and trembling indecision, which defeated all steady thought and prompt action. He was one of those who, having the essentials of manhood, has yet always been a child. He had tottered through life with no confidence in his arms, and as if his legs had been crutches, borrowed from a neighbouring tree rather than limbs of a native growth, and destined to the performance of his will. Gladly, at all times, would he prefer to lean upon the shoulders of his neighbour, rather than trust independently to his own thews and sinews. In politics he could be none other than the truckler to the existing authority, having preferences, however, which he dared not speak, vacillating between extremes, temporizing with every party, yet buffeted by all. The appearance of the troop brought the old gentleman down his steps to receive them. Barsfield only advanced, leaving Clayton to quarter the troop on the edge and within the enclosure of the park. Mr. Berkeley's manner was courteous and cordial enough, but marked by trepidation. His welcome, however, was unconstrained, and seemed habitual. Like the major part of the class of which he was a member, the duties of hospitality never suffered neglect at his hands. Like them, he delighted in society, and was at all times ready and pleased at the appearance of a guest. Nor did the perilous nature of events at the period of which we write, his own timidity, and the doubtful character of the new-comer, tend, in any great degree, to chill the freedom, and check the tendency of his habit in this respect. Accustomed always to wealth and influence, to the familiar association with strangers, and to a free intercourse with a once thickly-settled and pleasant neighbourhood, a frank, open-hearted demeanour became as much his characteristic as his jealous apprehensions. This was also his misfortune, since, without doubt, it increased the natural dependance of his mind. The habit of giving a due consideration to the claims of others, though a good one, doubtless, has yet its limits, which to pass, though for a moment only, is to stimulate injustice, and to encourage the growth of a tyranny to our own injury. In his connexion with those around him, and at the period of which we write, when laws were nominal, and were administered only at the caprice of power, the virtue of Mr. Berkeley became a weakness; and he was accordingly preyed upon by the profligate and defied by the daring—compelled to be silent under wrong, or, if he resented it, only provoking thereby its frequent repetition. His mild blue eye spoke his feelings—his nervousness amply announced his own consciousness of imbecility, while his pale cheek and prematurely white hair told of afflictions deeply felt, and of vexing and frequent strifes, injuries, and discontent. On the present occasion he received his guest with a kindly air of welcome, which was most probably sincere. He was quite too feeble not to be glad of the presence of those who could afford him protection; and there was no little truth in the boast of the tory captain to his companion, when he said that the timidity of Berkeley would be one of the probable influences which might facilitate his progress in the courtship of his daughter. The manner of Barsfield was influenced somewhat by his knowledge of the weakness of Mr. Berkeley, not less than by his own habitual audacity. He met the old gentleman with an air of ancient intimacy, grasped the proffered hand with a hearty and confident action, and, in tones rather louder than ordinary, congratulated him upon his health and good looks. D 2 “I have not waited, you see, Mr. Berkeley, for an invitation. I have ridden in and taken possession without a word, as if I was perfectly assured that no visiter could be more certainly welcome to a good loyalist like yourself, than one who was in arms for his majesty.” “None, sir—none, Captain Barsfield—you do me nothing more than justice. You are welcome—his majesty's officers and troops are always welcome to my poor dwelling,” was the reply of the old man, uttered without restraint, and seemingly with cordiality; and yet, a close observer might have seen that there was an air of abstraction indicative of a wandering and dissatisfied mood, in the disturbed and changing expression of his features. A few moments elapsed, which they employed in mutual inquiries, when Lieutenant Clayton, having bestowed his men, their baggage, and wagons agreeably to the directions given him, now joined them upon the steps of the dwelling, and was introduced by Barsfield, in character, to his host. Clayton reported to his captain what he had done with the troop, their disposition, and the general plan of their arrangement, in obedience to orders; turning to Mr. Berkeley at the conclusion, and politely apologizing for the unavoidable disturbance which such an arrangement must necessarily occasion in his grounds. The old man smiled faintly, and murmured out words of approbation; but, though he strove to be and to appear satisfied, he was evidently ill at ease. The invasion of his beautiful park by a prancing and wheeling troop of horse—its quiet broken by the oaths, the clamour, and the confusion common to turbulent soldiers, and the utter dispersion of his fine young horses, which had leaped the barrier in their fright, and were now flying in all directions over the plantation, brought to his bosom no small pang, as they spoke strongly for the extent of his submission. He controlled his dissatisfaction, however, as well as he could, and now urged his guests, with frequent entreaties, to enter his mansion for refreshment. They followed him from the piazza into a large hall, such as might have answered the purposes of a room of state, calculated for the deliberations of a thousand men. It was thus that our ancestors built, as it were, with a standard drawn from the spacious wilds and woods around them. They seemed also to have built for posterity. Huge beams, unenclosed, ran along above, supporting the upper chambers, which were huge enough to sustain the weight of a palace. The walls were covered with the dark and durable cypress, wrought in panels, which gave a rich, artist-like air to the apartment. Two huge fireplaces at opposite ends of the hall attested its great size, in one of which, even in the month of September, a few broken brands might be seen still burning upon the hearth. A dozen faded family pictures, in massive black frames, hung around —quaint, rigid, puritanical faces, seemingly cut out of board, after the fashion of Sir Peter Lely, with glaring Flemish drapery, and that vulgar style of colouring which makes of red and yellow primary principles, from the contagion of which neither land, sea, nor sky is suffered in any climate to be properly exempt. The furniture was heavy and massive like the rest—suitable to the apartment, and solid, like the dwellings and desires of the people of the by-gone days. Seats were drawn, the troopers at ease, and the good old Madeira of the planter soon made its appearance, to which they did ample justice. The generous liquor soon produced freedom of discourse; and, after a few courteous and usual overtures, consisting of mutual inquiries after the health of the several parties present, their relations, friends, and so forth, the conversation grew more general, and, perhaps, more important, as it touched upon the condition of the country. “You have quiet now, Mr. Berkeley,” said Barsfield. “The rousing defeats which the rebels have recently sustained have pretty well done them up on every side. 7* The game is very nigh over, and we shall soon have little else to do than gather up the winnings. The drubbing which Cornwallis gave that conceited fellow, Gates, and the surprise of Sumter, both events so complete and conclusive, will go very far towards bringing the country back to its loyalty.” “God grant it, sir,” was the ardent response of Mr. Berkeley, “for we shall then have peace. These have been four miserable years to the country, since the beginning of this war. Neighbour against neighbour, friend against friend, and sometimes even brother arming and going out to battle with his brother. It has been an awful time, and Heaven grant, sir, it may be as you say. Heaven restore us the quiet and the peace which have been for so long strangers in the land.” “You shall have it, sir, I promise you, after this; though I should think, by this time, you have been perfectly freed from the incursions of that skulking fellow, Marion. The report is that he has disbanded his men, and has fled into North Carolina. If so, I shall have little use for mine; and these arms, which I have brought for distribution among your loyal neighbours, will scarcely be necessary to them. Have you any intelligence on this subject, Mr. Berkeley?” “No, sir—no, none! I am not in the way, Captain Barsfield, of hearing intelligence of this nature. I know nothing of the movements of either party.” This reply was uttered with some little trepidation; and, as the old gentleman spoke, he looked apprehensively around the apartment, as if he dreaded to see the redoubtable “swamp fox” and all his crew, “Roaring Dick,” “Thumbscrew,” and the rest, fast gathering at his elbow. Barsfield smiled at the movement, and crossing one leg over another, and slapping his thigh with an air of unmitigated self-complaisance as he spoke, he thus replied, rather to the look and manner than the language of his host:— “Well, sir, I hope soon to rid you of any apprehensions on the subject of that marauding rebel. I am about to become your near neighbour, Mr. Berkeley.” The old gentleman bowed in token of his satisfaction at the intelligence. Barsfield continued— “You have heard, doubtlessly, that I am now the proprietor of the noble estate of `Kaddipah,' formerly the seat of Max Mellichampe, and confiscated to his majesty's uses on account of that arch-traitor's defection. Having had the good fortune to slay the rebel with my own hand, his majesty has been pleased to bestow upon me the estate which he so justly forfeited.” There was some emotion of an equivocal sort visible in the countenance of Berkeley, as he listened to this communication. A shade of melancholy overspread his face, as if some painful memory had suddenly grown active; and a slight suffusion of his eyelashes was not entirely undistinguished by his guests. Struggling with his feelings, however, whatever may have been their source, the old man recovered himself sufficiently to reply, though in a thick voice, which left his language but half intelligible, “Yes—yes, sir—I did hear—I'm glad, sir—I shall be happy—” And here he paused in the imperfect speech which Barsfield did not leave him time to finish. “There will be nothing then, sir, that any of us will have to fear from these outliers in the swamps; when that takes place, `Kaddipah,' sir, so long as the war continues, will be a place of defence, sufficiently well guarded as a post to resist any present force of Marion; and, as I shall have charge of it, I think it safe to say, from what they know of me, they will not often venture even within scouting distance. Talking of scouts, now, Clayton, where's the fellow we picked up to-day, having a pass from Proctor? He looks as if he would make an admirable one. If his eyes only see as far as they seem willing to go, he is certainly a very valuable acquisition.” A distinct hem from another quarter of the hall attracted all eyes in that direction, and there, squat upon the hearth of one of the fireplaces, sat the form of Blonay. He had piled the dismembered brands together, and sat enjoying the fire, unperceived, and certainly unenvied. At what time he had so secretly effected his entrance, was utterly unknown to any of the party. Barsfield started as he beheld him, and, seeming to forget his host, hastily addressed him:— “Why, how now, fellow?—you seem to make yourself at home. Why are you here?—why did you not remain with the troop?” “Why, cause I ain't one of them, you see, cappin, and they all pokes fun at me.” The simplicity of his reply disarmed Barsfield of his anger, and his presence gave him a new subject upon which to enjoy himself. The Half-Breed was now made to undergo another examination, conducted by both the officers, who mingled freely with their inquiries sundry poor jests at his infirmity, all of which fell upon the seemingly steril sense of the subject as if he had been so much marble. While thus engaged an inner door was thrown open, and the guests started involuntarily to their feet. “My daughter, gentlemen, Miss Berkeley—my niece, Miss Duncan,” were the words of the old man, uttered with an air of greater elevation than was his wont. The two ladies were provided with seats, and in the momentary silence which followed their first appearance, we may be permitted to take a passing glance at their persons. Our opinions may well be reserved for another chapter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. The appearance of Janet Berkeley fully justified the high encomium which Barsfield had passed upon her beauties; yet nothing could be more unassuming than her deportment—nothing more unimposing than her entire carriage. A quiet ease, a natural and seemingly effortless movement, placed her before you, and, like all perfect things, her loveliness was to be studied before it could be perceived. It did not affront you by an obtrusion of any thing remarkable. Her features were all too much in unison with one another—too symmetrically unique, to strike abruptly: they seemed rather to fill and to absorb the mind of the spectator than to strike his eye. Her person was rather small and slender: her features, though marked by health, were all soft and delicate. A pale, high forehead, from beneath which a pair of large black eyes flashed out a subdued, dewy, but rich, transparent light—a nose finely Grecian—cheeks rather too pale, perhaps, for expression—and a mouth which was sweetly small and delicately full,—were the distinguishing features of her face. Her chin, though not prominent, did not retreat; and her neck was white and smoothly round, as if a nice artist had spent a life in working it to perfection. Her hair, which was long and dark, was gathered up and secured by a white fillet, without study, yet with a disposition of grace that seemed to denote the highest efforts of study. It was the art which concealed the art—the fine taste of the woman naturally employed in adorning the loveliest object in creation—herself. It was the fashion of the time to pile the hair in successive layers upon the crown, until D 3 it rose into a huge tower, Babel-like and toppling. Janet was superior to any such sacrifice of good sense and good taste, simply in compliance with a vulgar rage. Her long tresses, simply secured from annoyance, were left free to wander where they would about her neck, to the marble whiteness of which they proved an admirable foil; while the volume was so distributed about the head as to prevent that uncouth exhibition of its bulk in one quarter which is too much the sin of taste in the sex generally. So admirably did the features, the dress, and the deportment of Janet Berkeley blend in their proper effects together, that the dullest sense must have felt their united force, even though the eye might not have paused to dwell upon any one individual beauty. Her carriage denoted a consciousness of her own strength, which spoke forcibly in contrast with the equally obvious feebleness of her father's spirit. Perhaps, indeed, it was the imbecility and weakness of his, which had given strength and character to hers. It is not uncommon for the good natural mind to exercise itself in those attributes which, in others, they perceive inactive and wanting to their owners. She had seen too many evil results from her father's indecision and imbecility, not to strive sternly in the attainment of the faculty in which he was so lamentably deficient; and she had not striven in vain. Though yet unenforced to open exercise and exhibition of its strength by controlling and overcoming dangers, the heart of Janet Berkeley was strong in her, and would not have been unprepared for their encounter. Her untroubled composure of glance, her equanimity of manner, her unshrinking address, and the singular ease with which, without tremour or hesitation, her parting lips gave way to the utterance of the language she might deem necessary to the occasion, were all so many proofs of that strength of soul which, associated as it was with all the grace and susceptibility of woman, made her a creature of moral, not less than of physical, symmetry,— the very ideal of a just conception of the noblest nature and the gentlest sex. The deportment of Mr. Berkeley was unconsciously elevated as he surveyed hers: such is the influence of the pure heart and perfect character. His pride grew lifted in the contemplation; and, timid and tame, and without a manly spirit, as he was, he felt that he could willingly die to serve and to preserve her. “She is indeed a jewel, Barsfield!” said Clayton, in a whisper, aside to his superior; “she is a jewel,— you are a lucky man.” “A goddess!” was the quick reply, in similar tones, —“a goddess!—she will make Kaddipah a very heaven in my sight.” “Let it be a Christian heaven, then, I pray you, by dropping that abominable heathen name.” The other maiden, whom we have seen introduced as Miss Duncan, was an orphan, a niece of Mr. Berkeley, and, for the present, residing with her cousin. She was pretty, and her eyes danced with a lively play of light, that spoke a gay heart and cloudless disposition. Perhaps, at the first glance, she would have been found more imposing than Janet; there was more to strike the eye in her features and deportment, as there was more inequality—more that was irregular—none of that perfect symmetry, which so harmonizes with the observer's glance and spirit, as not often to arrest, at first, his particular attention. A study of her face, however, would soon disinthral, though it would not offend, the observer. It wanted depth—profundity—character. At a glance you beheld its resources. There was nothing more to see; and you would turn away to her more quiet companion, and find at every look, in every passing shade of expression, every transition of mood, that there was more hidden than revealed—that the casket was rich within—that there was a treasure and a mystery, though it might demand a power of the purest and the highest to unlock its spells, and to remove the sacred seal that was upon it. A few moments had elapsed after the entrance of the ladies, when a servant announced the supper to be in readiness, after the wholesome fashion of the country. A table was spread in an adjoining apartment, and now awaited the guests. Barsfield would have offered his arm to Janet, but she had already possessed herself of her father's. Lieutenant Clayton had already secured the company of Miss Duncan; and they were soon seated around the hospitable board. But where was Blonay—the despised—the deformed—the desolate? Miss Berkeley, presiding at the head of the table, remarked his absence, and her eye at once addressed her father. “The other gentleman, father?” she said, inquiringly. “Gentleman indeed!” was the exclamation of Barsfield, accompanied by a rude laugh, which was slightly echoed by his companion; “Gentleman indeed! give yourself no manner of concern on his account, Miss Berkeley. He is some miserable overseer—a sand-lapper from Goose Creek, of whom we know nothing, except that Proctor, the commandant at Dorchester, has thought proper to give him a passport to go where he pleases.” “He is my father's guest, sir,” was the dignified and rebuking reply; “and we can take no exception to his poverty, or his occupation, or the place from which he comes. We have not heretofore been accustomed to do so, and it would be far less than good policy now, when the vicissitudes of the times are such, that even a person such as you describe him to be may become not only our neighbour, but our superior, to-morrow.” Mr. Berkeley started from his chair in some little confusion. He felt the truth of what his daughter said, yet he saw that her speech had touched Barsfield to the quick. The red spot was on the cheek of the tory, and his lips quivered for an instant. “Janet is right, Captain Barsfield; the hospitality of Piney Grove must not be impeached. Its doors must be open to the poor as well as the rich; we cannot discriminate between them;”—and, so speaking, he hurried out to look after the Half-Breed. He had not far to look. To the great surprise of the old man, he found Blonay a listener at the door of the apartment. He must have heard every syllable that had been spoken. He had been practising after his Indian nature, and was not sensible of any impropriety in the act. Revolting at the task before him, Mr. Berkeley, with as good a grace as possible, invited the scout into the apartment— an invitation accepted without scruple, and as soon as given; and he sidled into a seat, much to the annoyance of Barsfield, directly in front of him. This little occurrence did not take place without greatly disquieting the host. He saw that Barsfield felt the force of the sarcasm which his daughter had uttered, and he strove, by the most unwearied attentions on his own part, to do away with all unpleasant feelings on the part of the tory captain. Janet, however, exhibited no manner of change in her deportment. She did not seem conscious of any departure from prudence, as she certainly had been guilty of no departure from propriety; but, when she saw the indefatigable and humiliating industry with which her father strove to conciliate a man whom she had good reason to despise as well as hate, the warm colour stole into her cheeks with a flash-like indignation, and her upper lip took its expression from the bitter scorn in her bosom, and curled into very haughtiness as she surveyed the scene. The expression passed away in an instant, however; and when, a little more composed himself, Barsfield ventured to cast a sidelong glance at the maiden, and saw how subdued, how gentle, how utterly wanting in malignity were her features, he dismissed from his mind the thought that what she had said, so directly applying as it did to himself—he having sprung from the dregs of the people, and such having 8 been his fortunes—was intended for any such application. The angry scowl with which the tory might have regarded the maiden, was turned, however, upon the Half-Breed; who, as he beheld its threatening expression, would have been glad to have taken to his heels, and to have hidden his disquiet in the surrounding woods. But the kind look of Janet reassured him, and he turned his frightful and blear eyes in no other direction. His mind, probably for the first time, seemed to take in a new sentiment of the loveliness of virtue. Though blear-eyed, he was not blind; and, as she did not seem to behold his deformity, he was able to examine her beauty. In morals, the German theory of the senses is more than half right. The odour and the colour are in us, rather than in the objects of our survey; and yet, unless acted upon by external influences, the latent capacity might never expand into energy and consciousness. To bring out this capacity is the office of education, and this art had never so far acted upon the Half-Breed as to show him how much there was of a good nature dormant, and silent, and mingled up with the evil within him. His education, in a leading respect, was yet to begin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. Let us back to the woods and their wild inhabitants. We have seen the success of the woodman in dissuading his young companion from the idle and rash demonstration which he sought to make upon the person of the tory captain. Prevented from any attempt upon the life of Barsfield, Mellichampe nevertheless determined upon watching his footsteps. In this design he was readily seconded by Witherspoon. This, indeed, was a duty with them both. They were then playing the part of scouts to Marion. Taking their way on foot, immediately after their enemies, they kept the cover of the forest, with the caution of experienced woodmen, venturing only now and then upon the skirts of the road, in such contiguity as to enable them to command a full view, for some distance on either hand, of every thing that took place upon it. Familiar with the neighbourhood, they availed themselves of each by-way and footpath to shorten the distance; and thus, gaining ground at every step, they were readily and soon enabled to come in sight of the persons they pursued. The fierce spirit of the youthful Mellichampe could scarcely be restrained by a wholesome prudence, while he saw, at moments, through the leaves, the person of his enemy. It was with no small increase of vexation, when they came in sight of Piney Grove, that he saw the troop of the tory turning into the avenue. Could he have listened to the dialogue between the tory captain and his lieutenant at this time, his fury would scarce have been restrainable. It would have been a far more difficult matter for his companion then to have kept him from his meditated rashness. A passing remark of Thumbscrew, as the course of Barsfield grew obvious, seemed to add new fuel to the fire already burning in his bosom. “So-ho! he's for Piney Grove to-night! Well, Airnest, that knocks up your business. There's no gitting to see Miss Janet while Barsfield's there, I reckon.” “And why not?” was the fierce demand?—“why not? I will see her to-night, by Heaven! though I die for it. I have promised her, and God help me as I shall keep that, and every promise that I have made, or shall ever make, to her. Do you think, Thumbscrew, that I fear this scoundrel? Do you think that I would not the rather go, if I thought that it was possible to encounter him alone? I have prayed for such a chance, and I would pray for it now, even were the odds more numerously against me.” “Don't be rash, Airnest—don't be headstrong and contrary, boy. It'll be mighty onwise and redic'lous for you to go to Piney Grove to-night, though you did make a promise: there's no use for it; and it's like going into the lion's den, as a body may say. Barsfield, you may be sure, will put out his sentries; and them tories, like the smallpox they have in Charleston now, are mighty catching. You can't go there with any chance of clearing the bush; and if that chap gets you in his gripe, it'll go monstrous hard with you. He knows you've got no reason to love him; and he's hearn, long ago, how you've swore agin him; and he'd like nothing better now, do you see, than to set finger upon you. You can't think how pleasant it would make him feel to put a grape-vine round your neck: so, you must keep quiet, and not think of seeing Miss Janet to-night.” “But I must and will think of it. I will see her at every hazard, and you need say nothing more on the subject, Thumbscrew, unless you change very greatly the burden of what you say. This caution—caution— caution—nothing but caution—is the dullest music: it sickens me to the soul. You are too careful of me, by half, Thumbscrew; I can't move but you follow and counsel me—striving to guard me against a thousand dangers and difficulties which nobody ever dreams of but yourself.” “That's because I loves you, Airnest, much better than anybody else, and much better, when the truth's spoken, than you loves yourself,” replied the woodman, affectionately putting his arms around the neck of his youthful companion: “I loves you, Airnest, and I watches you like an old hen that's got but one chicken left, and I clucks and scratches twice as much for that very reason. If there was a dozen to look after, now, the case would be different; I wouldn't make half the fuss that I make about the one; but, you see, when it so happens that the things a man's got to love gits fewer and smaller, they gits more valuable, Airnest, in his sight; for he knows mighty well, if he loses them, that he's jist like an old bird that comes back to the tree when the blossoms and the flowers have all dropped off and are rotting under it. It's mighty nigh to winter in his heart then, Airnest—mighty nigh—and the sooner he begins to look out for a place to sleep in, the wiser man you may take him to be. But, Airnest, 'taint altogither that I loves you so that makes me agin your going to-night to see the gal—” “Stop, Thumbscrew, if you please,” were the words of interruption sternly uttered by the youth; “you will change your mode of speech in speaking of Miss Berkeley, and, when you refer to her in my hearing, you will please do so with becoming respect.” “Swounds, Airnest, don't I respect her? Don't you know that I respects her? Don't I love her, I ax you, a-most as much as I loves you? and wouldn't I do any thing for you both, that wasn't a mean, cowardly thing? You know I doesn't mean to be disrespectful in what I says consarning her; and you mustn't talk so as if you thought I did. I says I'm agin your going to see her, or anybody at Piney Grove, not because it's you that's going, but because I wouldn't have anybody go, that b'longs to Marion's men, into the clutches of them there thieves and murderers. It'll be as much as your neck's worth to go there, for Barsfield is something of a sodger, and will be sure to put out scouts and sentries all round the house. If he don't he's no better than a nigger, and desarves to be cashiered.” “Danger or no danger, Thumbscrew, I'll go to Piney Grove this night, as I have promised. You may spare yourself all farther exhortation: I keep my word, though death be in the way.” 8* “Well, now, Airnest, that's what I call pervarsion and mere foolishness. She won't look for you, Airnest. She's a lady of sense and understanding, and won't so much as dream to see you after Barsfield's coming.” “Say no more,” said the youth, decisively; “I will go. Let us now return to our horses, and you can then go on to Broom Hollow, where I'll meet you by midnight.” The youth turned away while speaking, and the woodman followed him, though slowly, and with looks of deepest concern. “You wants to see her, Airnest, that's it—it ain't so much because you promised, as because you wants to keep your promise. Ah, Airnest, this love in you young people—it ain't sensible, and I say it ain't strong and lasting. No love is strong and lasting if it ain't sensible. This what you has now is only a sulky autumn fever, Airnest; it'll burn like old vengeance for a month or so, and everybody that don't know any thing about it might reckon it hot enough to set the woods a-fire; but it goes off monstrous quick after that, for you see it burns its substance all away, and then comes on the shaking ague, and it sticks to you, God only knows, there's no telling how long!” The youth smiled, not less at the earnestness of his companion's manner, than at the grotesqueness of his comparisons. He contented himself, as they pursued their way back to the cover which they had left, by insisting upon the superior nature of his affection to that which he had described. “Not so with me, Thumbscrew; I know myself too well; and, if I did not, I certainly know Janet too well ever to love her less than now, unless some change of which I dream not, and which I believe impossible—some strange change—shall come over both of us. But no more of this; let us see to our horses, and with the dark you can go on to Broom Hollow, where I will seek you as soon after I leave `Piney Grove' as I can.” The woodman shook his head and muttered to himself, with an air not less of decision than of dissent. If his companion was fixed in his determination, Thumbscrew was not less resolved in his; but of this he said nothing. Quietly enough, and with the composure and intimacy of two relying friends, they sought out their retreat, behind which, some hundred yards, a close bay gave shelter to their horses—two noble animals, well caparisoned, which bounded away beneath them with a free step and a graceful movement, though the darkness already covered the highway, making the path doubtful, if not dangerous, in some places, to riders less experienced and bold than themselves. They retraced the ground which they had just left, and when they had reached the avenue leading to “Piney Grove” they sunk into the contiguous woods, and there Mellichampe, alighting, prepared himself for that visit to his mistress from which his comrade had so earnestly endeavoured to dissuade him. Nor did he now forbear his solicitations to the same effect. He urged his objections more gently, yet with his former earnestness, only to meet with the same stern decision. “Well, now, Airnest,” said the faithful woodman, “sence you're bent to go, like a wilful fox that's still got a tail worth docking, suppose you let me go along with you? You'd better, now; I can keep watch—” “Pshaw! Thumbscrew, what nonsense! I need no watch, and certainly would not permit your presence at such a time. You know I go to meet with a lady.” “Swounds, Airnest! but she sha'n't see me.” “Why, man, of what do you speak? Would you have me guilty of a meanness, Thumbscrew?” “Dang it, Airnest! I see it's no use to talk. You're on your high horse to-day, and nobody can take you down. I'll leave you; but, Airnest, boy, keep a bright look-out, and stick to the bush close as a blind 'possum that's lame of a fore-paw. You're going among sharp woodmen, them same tories; and they'll give you a hard drive if they once sets foot on your trail. When do you say you'll come?” “About midnight—but don't wait for me. Go to sleep, old fellow, for I know you need it.” “Good-by, Airnest! God bless you!” “Good-by.” “And, Airnest—” “What now, Thumby?” Keep snug, that's all, and don't burn daylight—that's to say, don't waste time. Good-by.” The youth, leaving his horse carefully concealed and fastened in a well-chosen spot, hurriedly plunged forward into the woods with a precipitation seemingly intended to free him from the anxieties of his companion, who watched his progress for a few moments as he divided the bushes in his flight. Thumbscrew looked after him with all the concern of a parent in a time of trying emergency. He shook his head apprehensively, as, leading his own steed forth towards the highway, he seemed to prepare for his departure in the direction assigned him. He had scarcely reached the road, however, when the approach of a driving horseman struck his senses and arrested his progress. The scout drew back instantly into the cover of the bush, and, placing himself in a position which would enable him to retreat at advantage, should the horseman prove other than he wished, he whistled thrice in a manner peculiar to the men of Marion. He was instantly answered in the same manner by the horseman, who drew up his steed with the exchange of signals. Thumbscrew at once emerged from the copse, and was addressed by the stranger in a dialect adopted among the partisans for greater security. Thumbscrew replied by what would seem a question. “Owls abroad?” “Owls at home!” was the immediate response of the stranger, by which the calling in of the scouts to the main body was at once signified to his comrade. He continued, as they approached each other— “What owl hoots?” “Thumbscrew,” was the reply of Witherspoon, giving the familiar name by which his companions generally knew him. “Ah, Witherspoon,” said the other, who proved to be Humphries, “is that you?” “A piece of me—I ain't altogether myself, seeing that I ain't in a good humour quite.” “Well, stir up, for you're wanted. The boys have work on hand, and the `fox' has got news of a tory gathering, so he's gone to drinking vinegar, and that's sign enough to show us that we must have a brush. Major Singleton has ordered in our squad, and looks out for a squall. So there's news for you.” “I reckon I've got quite as much, Humphries, to give you back for it in return. What would you say, now, if I tell you that Barsfield is here, within five hundred yards of us, with a smart company of red-jackets, and two big wagons of baggage?” “No!” “But I say yes!” and the scout then proceeded to inform his comrade of those matters in reference to Barsfield's arrival at Piney Grove with which the reader has been already made acquainted. Humphries listened attentively, then exclaimed— “I see it, Thumby; Barsfield is to meet these same tories, and probably take the lead of them. We heard from a boy that they were to gather, but he could not say who was to command 'em; and the general thought he could dash in among 'em before they could get arms and ammunition for a start. He'll have more work now than he thought for.” “Well, and where are you bent now, Humphries?— ain't you going back with this news I tell you?” “Yes, to be sure; but you must go in yourself at once. I am pushing on for Davis, and Baxter, and little Gwinn: they are all out on your line. We want all the muzzles we can muster. Where's Mister Mellichampe?” The scout answered this question gloomily, as he told of the adventurous movement of the youth in visiting the “Piney Grove” while it was in the possession of the enemy, and of his own urgent entreaties to prevent it. “It's an ugly risk he's taking,” said Humphries; “but what can you do—you can't help it now?” “Why, yes, I think I can,” said the other, quickly. “I can't find it in my heart to leave the boy in the hands of them Philistines, and so, you see, Humphries, soon as I can hide my horse in the hollow, I'm going back after him. I won't let him see me, for he's mighty ticklish and passionate, and may get in a bad humour; but I can keep close on his skirts and say nothing— only, if harm comes, I can lend him a helping hand, you see, when he don't look for it.” “Well, you've little time, and, soon as you let him know that he's wanted, you must both push off for the swamp. There's a branch broke across the road at `My Lady's Fancy,'—the butt-end points to the right track; and, on the same line, after you get into the bush, you'll see another broken branch just before you,—go to the bush-end, and keep ahead—that'll lead you down to the first sentry, and that's McDonald, I think. But the two branches ain't thirty yards from each other; so that, if the one in the road should be changed by anybody, you'll only have to look round in the woods till you find the other.” Having given these directions, he stooped and whispered the camp passward for the night in the ears of his attentive comrade— “Moultrie!” Putting spurs to his steed, in another instant he had left the place of conference far behind him. Thumbscrew, then, returning to the wood, carefully placed his horse in hiding, and proceeded, according to the silent determination which he had made, upon the path taken by his young companion. He was soon in the thicket adjoining the plantation, and resolute to do his best to save the youth, over whom he kept a watch so paternal, from any of the evil consequences which he feared might follow from his rashness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER X. At the hospitable board of Mr. Berkeley, to which we now return, the parties appear seated precisely as we left them. Their condition is not the same, however. They have done full justice, during our absence, to the repast, and to their own appetites, rendered more acute from their active travel of the day. The first rude demands of hunger had been satisfied; the urgent business of the table was fairly over; and nothing now remained to prevent the tory captain from playing the double part of social guest and earnest lover. His position might well have prompted him to an unwonted effort in the presence of one whose favour he sought to win. Not so, however. Barsfield, though bold and insolent enough with a rude troop and in the forest, was yet abashed in the presence of the beautiful and innocent Janet. He was one of those instances, so frequently to be met with, of a man possessed of energies of mind calculated to reach distinction, but wanting in that delicacy of feeling and demeanour, the result only of polished society, which alone can sustain him there unembarrassed and at ease. Too harsh in his habits to conciliate without an effort, he was, at the same time, too little familiar with the nice delicacies and acute sensibilities of the female heart to make the attempt with judgment; and we find him, accordingly, the well-dressed boor, in a strange circle, endeavouring to disguise his own consciousness of inadequacy by a dashing and forward demeanour, which had all the aspect of impertinence. He made sundry efforts to engage the maiden and her young companion in the toils of conversation, but proved far less successful than his second in command, who led the way in the suggestion of topics, caught up the falling ends of chit-chat, and, with all the adroitness of an old practitioner, knotted them together as fast as his superior, in his clumsy efforts to do likewise, tore them asunder. Clayton was a lively, brisk, ready youth, not over-well informed, but with just sufficient reading and experience to while away a dull hour with a thoughtless maiden. Janet heard him with respect, but said little. Rose Duncan, however, had few restraints—certainly none like those restraining the former,—and she chatted on with as thoughtless a spirit as if there had been no suffering in the land. Barsfield envied his lieutenant the immense gift of the gab which the latter possessed, and his envy grew into a feeling of bitter mortification, when every effort of his own to engage Janet in dialogue failed utterly, and, evidently, quite as often from his own inefficiency, as from the maiden's reluctance, to maintain it. A quiet “Yes” or “No” was the only response which she appeared to find necessary in answer to all his suggestions; and these, too, were uttered so coldly and so calmly, as to discourage the otherwise sanguine tory in the hope that maiden bashfulness alone, and not indifference, was the true cause of her taciturnity. The old man, her father, as he saw the anxiety of Barsfield to fix his daughter's attention, and, as he hoped to conciliate one having a useful influence, strove to second his efforts by so directing the course of the conversation as to bring out the resources of the maiden; but even his efforts proved in a great degree unsuccessful. Her mind seemed not at home in all the scene, and exhibited but little sympathy with those around her. To those who looked closely, and could read so mysterious a language as that of a young maiden's eye, it might be seen that, in addition to her reluctance to converse with Barsfield, there was also a creeping fear in her bosom, which chilled and fevered all its elasticity. As the hour advanced, this feeling showed itself by occasional unquiet movements of her eye, which glanced its sweet fires fitfully around, as if in searching for some object which it yet dreaded to encounter. This state of disquietude did not fail to strike the keen watchfulness of Barsfield, whose own imperfect success only made him the more jealously observant. Though unable to win the heart of a fair lady, he was yet not altogether incapable of perceiving its movements; and he soon discovered that, in addition to the dislike which Janet entertained for his pretensions, there was ground enough to imagine that she had far less aversion to those of another. He watched her the more closely from this reflection, and soon had assurance doubly sure on the subject of his conjecture. In the meanwhile the supper things had undergone removal; the several persons of the party were disposed about the room, the two ladies occupying the sofa, at one arm of which, and immediately beside Rose Duncan, sat Lieutenant Clayton, bending forward, and exchanging with her a free supply of chit-chat, sentimental and capricious. Barsfield, on the other hand, addressed his regards only to Janet, who sat, statue-like and pale, seemingly unmoved by all she heard, and with that air of abstraction and anxiety which shows the thought to be far distant. There was a dash of apprehension also Vol. I.—E in her air, such as the young fawn, skirting the roadside for the first time, might be supposed to exhibit, under the suggestion of its own timid spirit, rather than of any real danger from the approach of the hunter. This expression of countenance, however the maiden might labour for its concealment, was yet sufficiently evident to one so jealously aroused and suspicious as the tory captain; and he could not forbear, at length, as he found that all other topics failed to bring about a regular conversation with her, to insinuate his own doubts of that perfect composure of her mind which, in reply to his inquiry, her language had expressed, but which he did not think, at the same time, that she really entertained. “Something surely has occurred to trouble you, Miss Berkeley—some unlucky disaster, no doubt? Your favourite nonpareil has broken bonds, perhaps—your mocking-bird has sung his last song before strangling himself between his wires,—something equally, if not more sad, has fastened itself upon your spirits, and taken the wonted colour from your cheeks. Let me sympathize with you in your misfortune, I pray you; let me know the extent and the cause of your affliction.” How bitterly ironical was the glance which accompanied this speech. “Rather say,” replied the laughing Rose, quickly and archly, as she beheld the annoyance which the words of the tory had brought to her cousin,—“rather say that she dreads some danger to her favourite—that she has seen some threatening hawk hovering over her dovecot, and dreads momently that he will pounce upon the covey, and—” “Rose! Rose Duncan!” hurriedly exclaimed Janet, with a most appealing glance of her eye, for she knew the playful character of her companion; “No more of this, Rose, I beg you. I am not in the humour for sport this evening. I beg that you will desist. I am not well.” “Oh, if you beg so prettily, and so humbly too, I have done, coz. I would not vex you for the world, particularly when you surrender so quietly at discretion. But, really, I have no other way to revenge myself for the sarcasms I am made to endure by Mr. Clayton; he is really so witty—so very excruciating.” She turned, as she spoke, with a full glance of her arch blue eye upon Clayton, and with an expression of face so comically sarcastic, that she even succeeded in diverting the glance of Barsfield from the face of her cousing to that of his lieutenant. Clayton laughed sillily in reply, and strove to meet the sarcasm with as much good-nature as would disarm it. He replied at the same time playfull to Rose, and the conversation went on between them. This little episode—the allusion of Rose, though innocently made on her part, was calculated to increase as well the apprehensions of Janet as the suspicions of Barsfield; and he determined not to yield the point, but, if possible, pressing it still more home, to see if he could not elicit some few more decided proofs of that disquiet of the heart under which Janet so evidently laboured. He was not troubled with those gentlemanly scruples which should have produced a pause, if not a direct arrest, of such a determination. On the contrary, he knew of no principles but those which were subservient to the selfish purposes of a coarse, unpolished soul. “This allegory of your fair friend, Miss Berkeley, would seem not altogether wanting in some direct application, if one may judge from the degree of annoyance which it occasions you. Is it true that some favourite dove is in danger—does the hawk really hang over head; and am I to trace in the likeness of the one, a wild rebel, an outlaw of the land—some sentimental robber of the swamp—and, in the other, the vigilant E 2 sentinel of an indulgent monarch, keeping watch over the fold and protecting it against the excursive marauder? If so, in which of these two shall I hold Miss Berkeley to be so greatly interested?” Mr. Berkeley eagerly bent forward to hear the answer of his daughter; and even Blonay, who had withdrawn himself humbly into a corner of the room, seemed to comprehend something of the matter in hand, and stretched out his long neck, while his blear eyes peered into those which the maiden now fixed upon her questioner. “I am not good, sir, at solving riddles,” was her calm reply; “and really cannot undertake to say to what your present remark should refer. Perhaps you are right, however, in comparing to the innocent bird, in danger from the lurking fowler, the outlaw whom you call the rebel. The hawk, sir, stands well enough for the pursuer. But, if these comparisons be true, there is no danger to us, I assure you, as I myself believe, even should the outlaw become the marauder.” And here she paused, and her eyes were withdrawn from the person to whom she had spoken. The tory bit his lip; and, though he strove with that object, failed to suppress the dissatisfaction which her speech had occasioned. Taking up her reply, which had been evidently left unfinished, he proceeded to carry out the sentence. “But there is danger, you would say, from the latter. Let me remove your fears, Miss Berkeley. The hawk will watch over his charge without preying upon it, as you shall see. I am not unwilling to appear before you as one of the brood, and you and yours shall be secure in the protection I shall bring you against any lurking rebel in your swamps.” “I believe not that we have much to fear from that quarter, Mr. Barsfield, provided none but Marion's men get into them. They never trouble us.” “But, my dear,” said the old gentleman, “we are none the less indebted to Captain Barsfield for his aid and assistance. It is true, captain, we have not suffered much if any loss yet from the people who are out; but times may change, captain, and there's no knowing how soon your kind assistance may be of the utmost importance. We should not be ungrateful, Janet.” “I would not, father,” responded the maiden, meekly; “Captain Barsfield has my thanks for the aid he has proffered us, though I still think we shall not find it necessary. Our home has always been a quiet one, and has been respected by all parties. My father,” and here she turned to Barsfield with a free and fearless glance, “My father is an invalid, and cannot take any part in the war which is going on; and while he extends his hospitality to all, without distinction, he may well hope to need little of the aid of either in defending him from any. It is as little, under these circumstances, as we can require, that our guest shall forbear the use of language which might either give us pain, as it refers contemptuously or unjustly to our friends and those whom we esteem, or must involve us in the controversy which we should better avoid. Captain Barsfield will forgive me if I am unwilling to listen to the abuse of my countrymen.” The manner of the maiden was so dignified as to silence farther controversy. Barsfield submitted with a very good grace, though inwardly extremely chafed at the resolute and unreserved manner in which she spoke of those whom he had denounced as rebels, and to whose patriotic conduct his own had been so unhappily opposed. He strove, however, not merely to subdue his ill-humour, but to prove to her that it had given way to better feelings; and, with a due increase of courtesy, he arose, and would have conducted her to the fine old harpsichord, which formed a most conspicuous article of the household furniture in the apartment. She declined, 9* however, to perform, in spite of every compliment which he could bestow upon her skill and voice, with both of which he appeared to be familiar. Her father added his solicitations also; but she pleaded unpreparedness and her own indisposition so firmly, that the demand was at length given up. The lieutenant, however, was more successful with the inconsiderate and laughing girl who sat beside him. She offered no scruples—said she loved to play and sing of all things in the world; and, taking her seat in the midst of her own jest and laughter, touched the keys with a free finger, that seemed perfectly at home, while she sang the following little ditty, with a fine clear voice which filled the apartment:— I. Though grief assail thee, young heart, And doubt be there, And stone-eyed care, And sickness ail thee, young heart, Love on—love on. II. A greater anguish, young heart, Than these can be, Should love, in thee, For ever languish, young heart!— Love on—love on. III. Life's choicest pleasure, young heart, Can only wait On her whose fate Makes love her treasure, young heart!— Love on—love on. IV. And know that sorrow, young heart, And wo, and strife, Belong to life, And are love's horror, young heart— Love on—love on. V. They fear his glances, young heart, And fleet away As night from day, When he advances, young heart— Love on—love on. VI. A happy comer, young heart, Love's earliest bird May now be heard, With voice of summer, young heart— Love on—love on. VII. Around thee springing, young heart, Bird, leaf, and flower, That fill thy bower, Are ever singing, young heart Love on—love on. While the song of Rose was yet trilling in their ears, a faint but distinct whistle penetrated the apartment. The quick and jealous sense of Barsfield was the very first to hear it; and, from the corner where he sat crouching, the long neck of Blonay might have been seen suddenly thrust out, as his head leaned forward to listen. The eye of the tory captain involuntarily turned upon the face of Janet Berkeley: a deeper paleness had overshadowed it; and, though she did not, and dared not, look in the direction of her observer, she well knew that his gaze was fastened upon her, and this knowledge increased her confusion. The suspicions of Barsfield, always active, were doubly aroused at the present moment, though, with the policy of a practised soldier, he yet took especial care to conceal them. It was curious to look on the Half-Breed all the while. The instinct of the scout had awakened into a degree of consciousness with that whistle, which all the sweet music of Rose Duncan, to which he had been listening, could never have provoked. His thought was already in the woods; and, like some keen hound, his mood began to grow impatient of restraint, and to hunger after the close chase and the bloody fray. The eye of Barsfield, turning from the face of the maiden, was fixed upon him, and, with his habitual caution, Blonay, as he saw himself observed, drew in his head, which now rested with his usual listlessness upon his shoulder, while he seemed to lapse away into his accustomed stupor. The signal, if such it were, was again repeated, and closer at hand. A faint smile curled the lips of the tory captain, and his glance again settled upon the face of Janet. She strove to encounter that glance of inquisitive insolence, but her heart was too full of its fears. She could not—her eye sank away from the encounter, and the suspicions of the tory were confirmed. “There's a signal for somebody,” was his careless remark. “A signal!” exclaimed Clayton and Rose, in the same breath. “A signal!” said Mr. Berkeley, in alarm. “Yes, a signal—and the signal of one of Marion's men,” was the reply of Barsfield. “He has strayed this time into the wrong grounds, and will be laid by his heels if he heed not his footsteps.” The hands of Janet were clasped involuntarily, and a prayerful thought was rapidly springing in her mind, while her heart beat thick with its apprehensions. “Why do you think it a signal of Marion's men, captain?” was the inquiry of Clayton; “may it not be the whistle of some idler among our own?” “No; he might run some risk of a bullet if that were the case. Our loyalists know these sounds too well not to prick their ears when they hear them. That whistle is peculiar, and not so easily imitated. There—you hear it again! The enemy is daring, if he be an enemy; if a friend, he is not less so.” “It may be one of the negroes,” was the timidly-expressed suggestion of Mr. Berkeley. “Miss Berkeley will scarcely concur with you in that conjecture,” was the sarcastic response of Barsfield, while his eye scrutinized closely and annoyingly the rapidly changing colour upon her cheeks. As he gazed her emotion grew almost insupportable, and her anxiety became so intense as to be perceptible to all. Her eyes seemed not to regard the company, but were fixed and wild in their frozen stare upon a distant window of the apartment. That glance, so immoveable and so full of earnest terror, proved a guide to that of the tory. He read, in its intensity of gaze, a farther solution of the mystery; and, turning suddenly in the same direction, the secret was revealed. The distant, but distinct and well-known features of Ernest Mellichampe were clearly seen through the pane, looking in over the head of Blonay, from the piazza to which he had ascended. The movement of Barsfield was instantaneous. With a fierce oath he dashed from his seat, and, seizing his sabre, which lay upon a neighbouring table, rushed towards the entrance. The movement of Janet Berkeley was not less sudden. She darted with a wild cry, something between a shriek and a prayer, and stood directly in his pathway—her eye still fixed upon the window where her lover stood,—her heart still pleading for his safety,—her arm uplifted for his defence. “Let me pass, Miss Berkeley,” were the hurried words and stern demand of the tory. “Never—never—I will perish first,” she exclaimed, incoherently and unconsciously, in reply. He extended his arm to put her aside, and by this time the whole party had arisen from their seats, wondering at what they saw, for they were ignorant of the knowledge possessed by the tory. The father of the maiden would have interposed, and Rose Duncan, surprised and terrified, also came forward; but Janet Berkeley heeded them not. Furious at the interruption, Barsfield cried out to Clayton to pursue. “The rebel Mellichampe!” was his cry;—“he is in the piazza now,—he was but this instant at the window. Pursue him with all the men—cut him to pieces—give him no quarter—fly!” The form of Janet filled the doorway: her arms were extended. E 3 “Mercy!” she cried,—“mercy—mercy! Fly not,— pursue him not: he is gone,—he is beyond your reach. Mercy—have mercy!” They put her aside, and Barsfield hurried through the door. She caught his arm with a nervous grasp, and clung to him in the fervour of a desperation growing out of her accumulating terrors. He broke furiously away from her hold, and she sank, fainting and exhausted, but still conscious of her lover's danger, at full length along the floor. They were gone in the pursuit, the tory captain and his lieutenant; but Blonay, though he had risen with the rest, still remained in the apartment. The old father tottered to his daughter in consternation, and strove, with the assistance of Rose, to lift her from the ground. In his own rude way, and trembling, too, at the idea of his near approach to one so superior, Blonay proffered his assistance. “The poor gal,” he exclaimed, in tones of unwonted pity, while lifting her to the sofa,—“the poor gal, she's main frightened now, I tell you!” “My child—my child!—speak to me, my Janet!— look upon me!—it is your father, Janet!—look up to me, my daughter!” Her eyes unclosed, and her lips were moved in correspondence with the agonizing thoughts and apprehensions of her soul. “Mellichampe—rash, rash Mellichampe!—oh, father, they will take—they will murder him!” “Fear not, my child, fear not,” was the father's reply, his own accents full of that very fear which he required that she should not feel. Fear nothing; this is my house—these are my grounds. They shall not— no, my daughter, they dare not—touch a hair of the head of Mellichampe.” But the daughter knew better than her father his own weakness and the insecurity of her lover, and she shook her head mournfully, though listening patiently to all his efforts at consolation. In that moment the father's love of his child grew conspicuous. He hung over her, and sobbed freely like an infant. He said a thousand soothing things in her ears; predicted a long life of happiness with her lover; strove to reassure her on every topic of their mutual apprehension; and, on his own tottering frame, with the assistance of Rose Duncan, helped her to the chamber whose repose she seemed so imperatively to require.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI. The movement of Barsfield was almost as soon perceived by Mellichampe as it had been by Janet Berkeley. He saw, at a glance, the abrupt spring which the tory made from his chair, and, conjecturing the cause of his emotion, he prepared himself for flight. Though rash in the extreme, he was not so much of the madman as to dare the contest with such a force as Barsfield could bring against him; yet loath was he, indeed, to fly before so hated an enemy. “Oh, could we but cross weapons alone in that deep forest, with no eye upon us but those heavenly watchers, and the grim spirits that hover around and exult in the good stroke which is struck for vengeance! Could we there meet, Barsfield—but this hour—I would ask nothing more from Heaven!” This was the prayer of Mellichampe—these were his words, muttered through his clinched teeth, as, turning from the window, he placed his hands on the light railing of the balcony, and, heedless of the height—something over fifteen feet—leaped, with a fearless yet bitter heart, into the yard below. He had come, agreeably to his appointment with the maiden, and, as we have seen, in spite of all the solicitations of his friend and comrade. He had uttered his accustomed signals—they had been, of necessity, disregarded. Vexed and feverish, his blood grew more phrensied at every moment which he was compelled to wait; and, at no time blessed with patience, he had adopted the still more desperate resolution of penetrating to the very dwelling which contained the maiden whom he loved. What to him was the danger from an enemy at such a moment, and with feelings such as his? What were those feelings—what the fears which possessed him? patient and reckless, his feelings and his thoughts did equal injustice to her and to himself. “She forgets—she forswears me, like all the rest. He seeks her, perhaps, and she—ha! what hope had the desperate and the desolate ever yet from woman, when pomp and prosperity approached as his rival?” He little knew the maiden whom he so misjudged; but it was thus that he communed with his own bitter spirit, when he made the rash determination to penetrate to the dwelling, from the deep umbrageous garden in its rear, where, hitherto, the lovers had been accustomed to meet, in as sweet a bower as love could have chosen for a purpose so hallowed. But, though rash almost to madness in coming to the dwelling, Mellichampe was not so heedless of his course as to forget the earnest warnings which Witherspoon had given him. In approaching the house he had taken the precaution to survey all the premises beforehand. The grounds were all well known to him, and he made a circuit around them, by which means he discovered the manner in which the encampment of the troop was made, and how, and where, the sentinels were posted. These he surveyed without exposure, and, though immediately contiguous on more than one occasion to the lounging guard, he escaped without challenge or suspicion. From the park he stole back into the garden. Emerging from its shelter, he advanced to the rear of the building, and, passing under the piazza which encompassed it, he stole silently up the steps, sought the window, looked in upon the company, and was compelled, as we have seen, to fly. He was now in the court below; and, as the bustle went on above, he paused to listen and to meditate his course. Meanwhile the alarm was sounded from the bugle of the troop. The commotion of their movement distinctly reached his ears, and he leaped off fleetly but composedly among the trees, which concealed his flight towards the garden, just as the rush of Barsfield and Clayton down the steps of the piazza warned him of the necessity of farther precipitation. At that moment, darting forward, he encountered the person of one who was advancing. He had drawn his knife in the first moment of his flight, and, looking now only for enemies, it had nearly found its sheath in the breast of the stranger, when the tones of his voice arrested the fugitive. “Ha, Mass Arnest, dat you? Lord 'a macy, you 'most knock de breat out my body.” “Silence, Scip—not a word, villain. I am pursued by the tories. Would you betray me?” were the hurried and emphatic, but suppressed words of Mellichampe. “'Tray you, Mass Arnest—how-come you tink so? Enty da Sip—you truss Sip always, Mass Arnest—truss 'em now,” was the prompt reply of the negro, uttered in tones similarly low. “I will, Scip—I will trust you. Barsfield is upon me, and I must gain the garden.” “No go dere. Tory sodger jist run 'long by de garden fence.” “Where then, old fellow?” The negro paused for a moment, and the clattering of the sabres was now heard distinctly. 10 “Drop, Mass Arnest, drop for dear life close behind dis tree. Hug 'em close, I yerry dem coming.” “I have it,” said the youth, coolly, to the bewildered negro, as the sounds denoted the approach of the pursuers to that quarter of the area in which this brief conference had been carried on— “I have it, Scip. I will lie close to this fallen tree, and do you take to your heels in the direction of the woods. To the right, Scip—and let them see you as you run.” “How den, Mass Arnest—wha' de good ob dat?” “Fly, fellow, they come—to the right, to the right.” With the words Mellichampe threw himself prostrate, close beside a huge tree that had been recently felled in the enclosure, while the faithful negro darted off without hesitation in the direction which had been pointed out to him. In another moment a body of the troopers was scattered around the tree, bounding over it in all directions. Barsfield led the pursuit, and animated it by his continual commands. The scene grew diversified by the rushing tumults and the wild cries of the pursuers, and it was not many minutes before the chase was encouraged by a glimpse which they caught of the flying negro. At once all feet were turned in the one direction. Soldier after soldier passed in emulous haste over the log where Mellichampe lay, and, when the clamour had sunk away in the distance, he rose quietly, and coolly listening for a few seconds to the distant uproar, he stole cautiously back into the garden, in the crowded shrubbery and thick umbrage of which he might have readily anticipated a tolerable concealment while the night lasted from all the troop which Barsfield could muster. Here he could distinguish the various sounds and stages of the pursuit; now spreading far away to the fields and on the borders of the park—and now, as the adroit Scipio doubled upon his pursuers, coming nigher to the original starting-place. But whether it was that Seip's heart failed him, or his legs first, may not be said. It is enough to know that he began to falter. His enemies gained ground rapidly upon him. He passed into a briercopse, and lay close for a while, though torn by their thorns at every forward movement, in the hope to gain a temporary rest from the pursuit; but the chase tracked him out, and its thick recesses gave him no shelter. The sabres were thrust into the copse in several places, and, dreading their ungentle contact, the hunted negro once more took to his heels. He dashed forward and made for a little pine thicket that seemed to promise him a fair hope for concealment; but, when most sanguine, an obtrusive vine caught his uplifted foot as he sprang desperately forward, and, with a heavy squelch that nearly took the breath out of his body, he lay prostrate at the mercy of his enemy. Barsfield himself was upon him. With a fierce oath and a cry of triumph he shook his sabre over his head, and threatened instant death to the supposed Mellichampe. The poor negro, though not unwilling to risk his life for the youth, now thought it high time to speak; and, in real or affected terror, he cried aloud in language not to be mistaken, “Don't you chop a nigger with your sword now, I tell you. Gor A'mighty, Mass Cappin, you no guine kill a poor nigger da's no doing noting at all?” Barsfield recoiled in astonishment, only to advance upon the crouching black with redoubled fury; and he might have used the uplifted weapon simply from chagrin and disappointment, but that a stronger motive restrained him. With the strength and rage of a giant, he hurled the negro back to the ground from whence he had now half risen, and fiercely demanded of him why he had fled from the pursuit. “Ki! Mass Cappin, you ax a nigger wha' for he run, when you fuss run at 'em wid you big sword, and want to chop 'em wid it. Da's 'nough to make a nigger run, I 'speck. No nigger nebber guine 'tand for dat.” “Scoundrel! do not trifle with me,” was the fierce reply. “You have seen young Mellichampe.” “Who dat—Mass Arnest? No see 'em to-night, Mass Cappin.” “Scoundrel! you are lying now. I know it. You have hidden him away. Lead us to the spot, or put us upon his track so that we find him, or, by the eternal! I swing you up to these branches.” The negro solemnly declared his ignorance, but this did not satisfy the tory. “Disperse your men over the grounds—the park—the garden—on all sides. The rebel must be hereabouts still. He cannot have gone far. Leave me but a couple of stout fellows to manage this slave.” Clayton was about to go, when the words of Barsfield, uttered in a low, freezing tone of determination, reached his ear. “And, hear you, Clayton—no quarter to the spy—hew him down without a word.” The lieutenant departed, leaving the two men whom his superior had required. One of these, in obedience to the command of Barsfield, produced a stout cord, which was conveniently at hand, from his pocket. “Wha' you guine do now, Mass Cappin?” cried the negro, beginning to be somewhat alarmed at the cold-blooded sort of preparation which the soldier was making. “You shall see, you black rascal, soon enough,” was the reply. “Noose it now, Drummond,” was the order of the tory. It was obeyed, and in another moment the cord encircled the neck of the terrified Scipio. “Confess now, sir—confess all you have done—all that you know. Have you not seen the rebel to-night?” “Which one, Mass Cappin?” “No fooling, fellow. You know well enough who I mean—the rebel Mellichampe.” “Wha'—Mass Arnest?” “Ay.” “No, sa, Mass Cappin. It's trute wha' I tell you now. I berry glad for see Mass Arnest, but I ain't seen 'em dis tree day and seven week. He's gone, day say, high up de Santee, wid de rest.” “And you haven't seen him to-night?” “Da's a trute—I no see'm to-night.” “A d—d lie, Scipio, which must be punished. Tuck him up, Drummond.” “Hab a pity on poor nigger, Mass Cappin! It's a nigger is no wort salt to he hom'ny. Hab a pity on poor nigger. Ah, Mass Barsfield, you no guine hang Scip? I make prayers for you, Mass Barsfield, you no hang Scip dis time.” The negro implored earnestly as the design appeared more determinately urged by the tory. He was seriously terrified with the prospect before him, and his voice grew thick with horror and increasing alarm. “Confess, then, or, by God! you swing on that tree. Tell all that you know, for nothing else can save you.” “I hab noting to tell, Mass Cappin. I berry good nigger, da's honest, sa, more dan all de rest of mossa's niggers, only I will tief bacon, Mass Cappin. I can't help tief bacon when I git a chance, mossa. Da's all da's agen Scip, Mass Cappin.” There was so much of simplicity in Scipio's mode of defence, that Barsfield half inclined to believe that he was really ignorant of the place of Mellichampe's concealment; but, as he well knew that Scipio was a favourite family servant, and remarkable for his fidelity, he did not doubt but he would keep a secret concerning one so long intimate with it as Mellichampe to the very last moment. This suggestion hastened his decision. With the utmost composure he bade the soldier execute his office, and looked on calmly, and heard without heeding the many adjurations, and prayers, and protestations of the negro, 10* desperately urged, as they hurried him to the tree, over a projecting limb of which one end of the rope was already thrown. “Will you tell now, Scipio?” demanded Barsfield of the slave, in a tone of voice absolutely frightful to him from its gentleness. “Tell me where Mellichampe ran —tell where you have concealed him, and I let you go; but, if you do not, you hang in a few moments on this very tree.” “I no see'm, Mass Cappin—he no run, he stan' in de same place. Hab a pity, Mass Cappin, 'pon Scipio, da's a good nigger for old mossa, and da's doing noting for harm anybody.” “Once more, Scipio—where is the rebel?—where is Mellichampe?” “Da trute, Mass Cappin, I don't know.” “Pull him up, men.” The cruel order was coolly given, and in tones that left no room in the minds of the soldiers to doubt that they were to execute the hurried sentence. Struggling, gasping, and labouring to speak, Scipio was lifted into air. He kicked desperately, sought to scream, and at length, as the agony of his increasing suffocation grew more and more oppressive, and in feeble and scarcely intelligible accents, he professed his willingness now to do all that was required of him. “I tell—I tell ebbry ting, Mass Cappin—cut de rope, da's all. I tell—cut 'em fass—lose 'em quick. Oh— he da mash my head—I choke.” The cord was relaxed with the utterance of this promise. The victim was suffered to sink down upon the ground, where, for a few moments, he crouched, half sitting, half lying, almost exhausted with struggling, and seemingly in a stupor from the pain and fright he had undergone. But Barsfield did not much regard his sufferings. He took the negro at his word, and, impatient for his own revenge, hurried the movements of the poor creature. The rope was still twined about his neck, and thus, kept in continual fear of the doom which had been only suspended, he was required to lead the way, and put the pursuers upon the lost trail of the fugitive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII. “Come, sir—away—put us on the track of the rebel. Show where he is hidden—and, hark you, Scipio—not a word—no noise to tell him we are coming, or—” The threat was left unfinished, but it was nevertheless sufficiently well understood. The reply of the negro was characteristic. “Gor A'mighty, Mass Barsfield, enty I guine? You no 'casion push a nigger so. Ef you was to hang me up agen, I couldn't go no more faster dan I does.” He led the way freely enough; but it was not the intention of Scipio to betray the trust of Mellichampe, even if it had been in his power to lead them to the place of his concealment. His object was simply to escape a present difficulty. He had no thought beyond the moment. With this object, with the natural cunning of the negro, and the integrity of the faithful slave, he framed in his mind a plan of search, which, while it should be urged on his part with all the earnestness of truth, should yet still more effectually mislead the pursuers. Scipio was one of those trusty slaves to be found in almost every native southern family, who, having grown up with the children of their owners, have acquired a certain correspondence of feeling with them. A personal attachment had strengthened the bonds which necessity imposed, and it was quite as much a principle in Scipio's mind to fight and die for his owners, as to work for them. Regarding his young mistress with a most unvarying devotion, he had been made acquainted at an early period with the nature of the tie which existed between herself and Mellichampe, and many were the billets and messages of love, which had been confided by the two to Scipio, during the unsophisticated courtship which had been carried on between them. Proud of the confidence reposed in him, and fond of the parties, the trust of Mellichampe was sacred in his keeping; and, at the moment of his greatest danger, when the rope was about his neck, and his life depended upon one whom he well knew to be merciless and unforgiving, he never once conceived the idea of effecting his escape by a revelation of any secret which might have compromised, in the slightest degree, either Mellichampe or the maiden. He now purposely led the tory from his object, trusting to his good fortune or his wit to relieve him from all subsequent emergencies. It does not need that we should show how, in the prosecution of his scheme, the adroit negro contrived to baffle the vindictive Barsfield. He led him from place to place, to and fro, now here, now there, and through every little turn and winding of the enclosure in front of the dwelling, until the patience of the tory became exhausted, and he clearly saw that his guide had deceived him. For a moment his anger prompted him to prosecute the punishment with which he had sought at first to intimidate the negro. But a fear of the influence of such a proceeding upon the maiden induced a more gentle determination. It was not, probably, the intention of Barsfield to carry into effect the threatened doom—his design was rather to procure the required intelligence by extorting a confession. He was now persuaded, so well had Scipio played his part, that the fellow was really ignorant. Finding that his long passages invariably led to nothing, he dismissed him with a hearty curse and kick, and hurried away to join Clayton, who, meanwhile, had been busied in the examination of the garden. The lieutenant had not been a whit more successful than his captain; for Mellichampe, the moment that he heard the pursuit tending in the quarter where he had concealed himself, simply moved away from his lair, and, leaping the little rail fence which divided the garden from the forest, found himself almost immediately in the shelter of a dense body of woods, which would have called for five times the force of Barsfield to ferret him out in at night. Familiar of old with the region, which had been consecrated in the walks and worship of love, he strolled off to a favourite tree, not thirty yards from the fence, in an arm of which, sheltering himself snugly, he listened with scornful indifference to the clamours of that hot pursuit which the tory still continued. He saw the torches blazing in the groves where he had crouched but a little while before, and almost fancied that he could distinguish at intervals the features of those who bore them, and sometimes even the lineaments of that one deadliest enemy, whom of all the world he most desired on equal terms to encounter. The chase was at length given over. Barsfield was too good a scout himself not to know that the woods in the rear of the garden must contain the fugitive. He was quite too familiar, however, with the nature of a Carolina thicket, to hope for any successful result of pursuit and search in that quarter. And yet he still looked with straining eyes upon its dense and gloomy spots, as if longing to penetrate them. Had he been strong enough in men—could he even have spared the force which he had under his command for any such purpose, he would not have hesitated for an instant; but, under existing circumstances, the risk would have been rash and foolish, to have exposed so small a body of men to the possibility of contact with a lurking enemy. He little knew that the particular foe was alone—and that, even at the moment when these meditations were passing through his mind, his hated rival sat looking composedly down upon the unavailing toil of his long pursuit. How many circumstances were there in his past history to make him detest the fugitive! How many interests and feelings, active at the moment in his bosom, to make him doubly desire to rid himself of one so inimical—so greatly in his way! He turned from the garden in a bitter mood of disappointment. The fever of a vexing fear and of a sleepless discontent was goading him with every additional moment of thought, and kept him from all appreciation of the beauty of the rich flowers and those sweet walks which, in the intercourse of Mellichampe and Janet, had made a fitly associated scene. He felt nothing of the garden's beauties—its sweet solemnity of shade—its refreshing fragrance—its slender branches and twining shrubs, that quivered and murmured in the night breeze; or of that exquisite art in the disposition of its groves and flowers, which, concealing herself in their clustering folds, peeps out only here and there, as if in childlike and innocent sport with her sister Nature. Having made his camp arrangements for the night, Barsfield left Clayton in command of the troop, still occupying the park as at their coming, and proceeded once more to the dwelling. Mr. Berkeley awaited his approach at the entrance. The old gentleman was in no little tribulation. The presence of Mellichampe at such a time in his grounds, and under circumstances which seemed to indicate the privity of one or more of the household to his visits, was calculated, he well knew, to make Barsfield suspicious of his loyalty. It was his policy, and he was solicitous to prove to the tory that the youth received no manner of encouragement from him; that his presence was unlooked-for, and, if not contrary to his commands, was at least without his sanction. He also well knew the aim of Barsfield with reference to his daughter, and it was not less his object, on this account, to impress the tory with the idea of his own ignorance on all subjects which concerned the rebel. In tremulous accents, confusedly and timidly, he strove to win the ear of his sullen and dissatisfied guest. “I am truly happy—Ah! I mean I am very sorry, Captain Barsfield—” and here he paused—the words were too contradictory, and his first blunder frightened him; but Barsfield, who also had his game to play, came to his relief by interrupting him in his speech. “Sorry for what, Mr. Berkeley? What should make you sorry? You have nothing, that I can see, to be sorry for. Your house is haunted by a rebel, and, though you may not encourage him, and I suppose do not, I yet know that hitherto you have been unable to drive him thoroughly away. It is your misfortune, sir, but will not be a misfortune much longer. You will soon be relieved from this difficulty. My force in a short time will be adequate to clear the country in this quarter of the troop of outliers that haunt it; and this duty, sir, I have now in charge. Leave it to me to manage the youngster— I shall make my arrangements for his capture, and he cannot long escape me. Once taken, he troubles neither of us again. He swings for it, sir, or there is no law in the land.” This discourse confounded the old gentleman. He was not unwilling to be thought free from any collusion with Mellichampe, but the youth was a favourite. The bitter speech of Barsfield, and the final threat, totally unmanned his hearer, and he exclaimed, in a voice made tremulous by his emotion— “What! Ernest Mellichampe—hang Ernest Mellichampe, captain? Why, what has the poor youth done?” “Done!” exclaimed the other; “done, Mr. Berkeley? Why, sir, is he not one of that traitorous brood of Max Mellichampe, who was so fierce an enemy of his king; so merciless in fight, and so uncompromising in whatever related to this struggle? I had the good fortune to serve my sovereign, as you know, by killing him; and, from what has been shown to me of this young man, I shall do my country no less a service by sending him after his father.” “Oh, ay, captain—but that was in fight. Of course, Ernest, if he lifts arms against our sovereign, must take his chance like any other soldier in battle, but—” “He has incurred another risk to-night, Mr. Berkeley —he has penetrated into my line of sentinels as a spy.” The tory silenced the well-intentioned speaker. They entered the hall, where Blonay still sat, alone, and in as perfect a condition of quiet as if there had not been the slightest uproar. Glancing his eye quickly around the apartment, and seeing that none other was present, Barsfield approached the Half-Breed with a look of stern severity, and, laying his hand upon his shoulder, he thus addressed him— “Hark'ee, fellow; you pretend to be a good loyalist —you have got Proctor's certificate to that effect—why did you not seek to take the rebel, when you were so much nigher the entrance than any of the rest? Did you not see him?” “Well, cappin, I reckon I did see him when he looked into the glass, but I didn't know that he was a rebel. I didn't see no harm in his looking in the glass.” “But when I moved—when I pursued—did you not see that he was my enemy?” “That's true, cappin; but that was jist the reason, now, I didn't go for'ad. I seed from your eyes that he was your enemy, and I know'd from what you did you wanted to git a lick at him yourself, and so I wouldn't put in. Every man paddle his own canoe, says I; and, if I has an enemy, I shouldn't like to stand by and let another man dig at his throat to spile my sport, neither would you, I reckon. It's no satisfaction for one man to jump between and take away another man's pleasure, as I may say, out of his mouth.” The code of Blonay was new to Barsfield, though, from its expression, he at once well understood the prevailing character of the speaker. It was for Barsfield to desire that his enemy should perish, no matter by whose hands—the passion of Blonay prompted his own execution of every deed of personal vengeance, as a duty incumbent on himself. A few words farther passed between them, in which the tory hoped he had secured the services of the Half-Breed, of whose value he had conceived a somewhat higher idea from the strange reason which he had given for his quiescence in the pursuit of Mellichampe. This over, the tory captain signified his determination to retire, and, with a cordial good-night to his host, he left the room, and was instantly conducted to his chamber. Meanwhile, in the apartment of the two cousins, a far different scene had been going on. There, immersed in her own fears and apprehensions, Janet Berkeley listened in momently increasing terror to every sound that marked the continued pursuit of her lover. As the clamour drew nigh or receded, her warm imagination depicted the strait of Mellichampe; and it was only when, after the departure of Barsfield for the night, when her father could seek her chamber, that she heard the pleasing intelligence of the tory's disappointment. It was then that the playful Rose, as she saw that the apprehensions of her cousin were now dissipated, gently reproached Janet for the want of confidence which she had shown in not unfolding to her the secret which the excitement of the preceding event had too fully developed. “To carry on a game of hide and seek so slyly, Janet —to have a lover, yet no confidant—no friend, and I, too, so near at hand. I, who have told you all, and kept nothing back, and would have locked up your secret so closely that no rival, no mamma, no papa, should ever have been the wiser. And such a fine subject for talk, Vol. I.—F 11 Janet, in these long, sweet summer nights—now, when all is quiet, and there is nothing of a cloud, dear, to be seen. Look, dearest—see what a beautiful night.” “I have no heart for it, Rose—none. I am very unhappy,” was the sad response of the afflicted maiden. “Serve you right—you deserve to be sad, Janet, if only for being so sly and silent. Why, I ask you again —why didn't you let me into the secret? I could have helped you.” “Alas! Rose, this secret has been too oppressive to me not to make me desire frequently to unfold it; but, as I have no hope with my love, I thought better to be silent.” “And why, dearest,” exclaimed the other, “why should you have no hope? Why should your love never be realized? Think you that Mellichampe is the man to play you false?” “No—oh, no! He would not—he could not. He is too devoted—too earnest in all that he does and feels, ever to forget or deny. But it has been a sad engagement throughout—begun in sorrow, amid strife and privation, and carried on in defiance of all danger, and with an utter regardlessness of all counsel. God knows, I so misgive these visits, that I should rather he would be false to me than that he should come so frequently into danger of his life.” “Now, out upon thee, cousin—how you talk! This danger is the very sweetness, and should not be a dampener of love. If the man be what he should be, he will not heed, but rather desire it, as in stimulating his adventure it will also stimulate his feeling and his flame. For my part, I vow that I would not have one of your tame, quiet, careful curs—your household husbands, who would neither do nor dare, but squat, purring like overgrown tabbies in the chimney-corner, pass away a long life of tedium in a protracted and monotonous humming. If ever I get a lover, which, Heaven knows, seems but a doubtful prospect at this moment, I vow he should have no quiet—he should be required to do just what you fret that Mellichampe is now doing. He should scale fences and walls, ford creeks when there's a freshet, and regularly come to visit me through the swamp; and this he must prove to me that he has done, by a fair exhibition of his bespattered boots and garments. As for difficulties such as these frightening a lover from his purpose, I would not give my name for any lover who would not smile upon, while overcoming them.” In a sadder tone than ever Janet replied to the playful girl, who continued to run on and interrupt her at intervals wherever her speech seemed more desponding than usual:— “It is not mere difficulties, Rose, but positive dangers, that I dread for Ernest; and, but that I know he will not heed my words in such a matter, I should utterly break with him, and for ever, if it were only to keep him away from the risk into which he plunges with little or no consideration. Twice or thrice has he nearly fallen a victim to this same man, Barsfield, who has a desperate hatred towards him—” “And a desperate love for you,” said the other. “Which is quite as idle, Rose, as the other is rash,” replied Janet, calmly, to the interruption. “Vainly have I implored him to desist—to forbear seeking or seeing me until the danger and the war are over; and, above all things, to avoid our plantation, where my father is too timid and too feeble to serve him when there is danger, and where I am certain that spies of the tories are always on the watch to report against any of the whigs who may be stirring.” “And, like a good, stubborn, whole-hearted lover, Mellichampe heeds none of your exhortations that would keep him away. Heaven send me such a lover! He should come when he pleased, and, if I prayed him at all, it should be that he would only leave me when I pleased. I would not trouble him with frequent orders, I assure you.” F 2 “Ah, Rose! would I had your spirits!” “Ah, Janet! would I had your lover! He is just the lover, now, that I desire; and these perils that he seems to seek, and this rashness of which you complain, commend him warmly to my imagination. Poor fellow! I'm only sorry that he should have his labour for his pains to-night; and must go back the way he came, without getting what he came for.” “Heaven grant that he may, Rose!” said the other, earnestly; “but do you know that even this alarm will scarcely discourage Ernest Mellichampe? He has promised to come to-night, and exacted my promise to meet him under the great magnolia. I am persuaded that he will keep his word, in spite of all the dangers that beset him. He is bold to hardihood, and I look not to sleep to-night until I have heard his signal.” “Confess, confess, Janet, that you will sit up in the hope to hear it.” “Not in the hope to hear it, Rose, but I will sit up— at least for some time longer. I could not sleep were I to go to bed, under the anxiety which the belief that he will come must occasion in my mind. But you need not wait for me.” “I will not—I should be very peevish were I to hear a love-signal, and have no share in the proceedings. I am certainly a most unfortunate damsel, Janet, having a heart really so susceptible, so very much at the mercy of my neighbours, without having one neighbour kind enough to help me in its management.” And thus, rattling on, the thoughtless girl threw herself upon her couch, and was soon wrapped in pleasant slumbers. Janet, sad and suffering, in the meanwhile turned to the open window, unconsciously watching the now rising moon, while meditating the many doubts and misgivings, the sad fears and the sweet hopes, of a true heart and a warmly interested affection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII. Barsfield sought his chamber, but not to sleep. Some active thought was in possession of his mind, operating to exclude all sense of weariness, and, indeed, almost to make him forget, certainly entirely to overlook, the previous fatigues of the day. He paced his room impatiently for several minutes before he perceived that the servant was still in waiting. When he did so, he at once dismissed him; but, immediately after, called him back. “Who's that—Tony?” “Yes, sa.” “Where does the traveller—the blear-eyed fellow— sleep to-night, Tony?” “In de little shed-room, Mass Cappin.” “Does it lock, Tony?” “He hab bolt inside, sir.” “'Tis well; take this; you may go now.” He gave the negro, as he dismissed him, an English shilling, which called forth a grin of acknowledgment and a liberal scraping of feet. Alone, the tory captain continued to pace up and down the apartment, absorbed seemingly in earnest meditation. But his thoughts did not make him forgetful of the objects around him. He went frequently to the windows, not to contemplate the loveliness of the night, but to see whether all was quiet in the little world below. His frequent approach to his own chamber door, which he opened at intervals, and from which he now and then emerged, had a like object; and this practice was continued until all sounds had ceased; until all the family seemed buried in the profoundest slumber. Cautiously, then, he took his way 11* from his own apartment, and proceeding through the gallery, he soon reached the little shed-room to which Blonay had been assigned. He paused for a single instant at the entrance, then tapped lightly, and was instantly admitted. For a brief space the eyes of Blonay failed to distinguish the person of the intruder. A few embers in the fireplace, the remnants of the light-wood brands which had shown him his couch, yielded a blaze, but one too imperfect for any useful purpose. The voice of Barsfield, however, immediately enlightened the Half-Breed. “A friend,” said the tory, in a tone low, carefully low, and full of condescension. “A friend, and one who needs the services of a friend. I have sought you, Mr. Blonay, as I have reason to believe I can rely on you. You have the certificate of Colonel Proctor, a sufficient guarantee for your loyalty; but our brief conversation this evening has convinced me that you are able, as well as loyal, and just the man to serve my purposes.” The tory paused, as if in expectation of some answer; and Blonay, so esteeming it, proceeded in his own way to the utterance of many professions, which might have been unnecessarily protracted had not the impatience of his visiter interposed. “Enough! I believe that you may be relied on, else I should not have sought you out to-night. And now to my business. You heard me say I had an enemy?” The reply was affirmative. “That enemy I would destroy—utterly annihilate— for several reasons, some of which are public, and others private. He is a rebel to the king, and a most malignant and unforgiving one. His father was such before him, and him I had the good fortune to slay. The family estate has become mine through the free grant of our monarch, in consideration of my good services in that act. Do you hear me, sir?” “Reckon I do, cappin,” was the reply of the Half-Breed. “Then you will have little difficulty in understanding my desire. This son is the only man living who has any natural claim to that estate in the event of a change of political circumstances which shall throw back the power of our sovereign. In such an event, he would be the proper heir; and would, with reason, oppose his claim to mine. That claim would be valid and incontestable, most probably, under any change of circumstances, were he once put out of the way. For this reason, if for none other, I would destroy him.” “And reason enough,” responded Blonay, “to kill a dozen rebels.” “True; but there are yet other reasons: he has aspersed me, denounced me to my face, on the commencement of this war, and under circumstances which prevented me from seeking any atonement. In arms I have never yet been able to encounter him; as, from his good knowledge of the swamp, he readily eludes my troop. He is, besides, attended by a fellow who watches over his safety, and follows and guards his every movement; and there are few men who manage with so much skill and adroitness as the man in question. He is only to be reached by one in a persevering search—one who would not turn an inch from his course, but, like the bloodhound, keep close upon the track without suffering any thing, not even force, to divert him from his object. Such a man I hold you to be.” Blonay thanked the tory for his good opinion, and the latter proceeded. “You are for killing your enemy with your own hand. I am indifferent who kills mine, so that he ceases to trouble me. The man who slays him for me is as much my instrument as the knife which, in your hand, does the good deed for you. Besides, even had I this desire, I could only pursue it at great sacrifice. I should be compelled to give up my public duties, which are paramount. I should be compelled to go singlehanded, and play the part of an outlier in the swamps along with those whom I attempt to overreach. I am too well known by them all ever to hope to win their confidence; and the very nickname which they have conferred upon me for my adherence to my sovereign, if repeated in my ears, as it would be by this taunting youth in question, would only drive my blood into a more foolish and suicidal rebellion than is theirs. Some other man—some single-hearted friend, must avenge and rid me of my enemy. Will you be that man?” “Well, now, cappin, I should like to know more about this business; and the man—I should like to hear his name.” “Mellichampe,—Ernest Mellichampe, the son of Colonel Max Mellichampe, killed at Monk's Corner, in January last.” “Why, I don't know the man, cappin—I never seed him, and shouldn't be able to make him out, even if I stumbled over him crossing a log.” “That is no difficulty. I will give you marks and signs by which you cannot fail to know him under any circumstances. You saw his face to-night. He came here to see—and that is another reason for my hatred— he came here to see, not our troop, nor our disposition, nor with any reference to our warfare, but simply to see the young lady of the house.” “What, the gal in black,—her that looks so grand and so sweet?” inquired Blonay, with some earnestness. “The taller—the dark-eyed one—the daughter of the old man, Mr. Berkeley.” “And you reckon there's love atween them?” curiously inquired the Half-Breed. “Ay, such love as I would not have between them,” bitterly responded the other: “I know that Mellichampe has long loved her, and I fear that she requites him in kind. This is another reason why I should hate him, for I too—but why should I tell you this? It is enough that I hate, and that I would destroy him. Here, Blonay, take this—it is gold—good British gold; and I give it as an earnest of what you shall have if you will bring me the ears of my enemy. Take the swamp after him—hunt him by day and by night; and when you can come and show me, to my satisfaction, that he troubles me no more, you shall have the sum doubled thrice. Say that you will serve me.” He put five guineas into the hand of the unreluctant Half-Breed, who at once deposited them from sight in a pocket of his garment; and yet, though he secured the money, Blonay paused before giving his answer. “Why do you hesitate?” demanded the tory. “Well,” said the other, in his drawling fashion, “I don't know, cappin, how one business can go with the other. I have, you see, a little affair of my own to settle with one of the rebels in Marion's men, that's rather like the business you wants me to go upon for you. Now, one must be settled 'fore the other; and 'tain't in natur, when a man's blood's up, that he should turn away from his own enemy to go after another man's. I'm on trail of my enemy now, and I should be sorry to drop it, I tell you; and, 'deed, cappin, I can't, no how.” Barsfield was still prepared to meet the difficulties suggested by his proposed instrument. “You need not give up one pursuit in taking up the other. It is fortunate for us that our enemies are both in the same drive—they are both men of Marion, and, in tracking one, the probability is that you cannot be very far from the other. Indeed, for that matter, the one will be most likely to help you to the other, as the squad of Marion must now be greatly reduced, and he cannot consequently venture to scatter them much. This is no difficulty, but rather an advantage.” Blonay was silenced, if not convinced on this point. He did not reply, but seemed for a few moments lost in deliberation; at length, breaking the silence abruptly, he F 3 spoke of another, and seemingly a foreign feature of the affair. “And you say, cappin, that there's love atween him and the young gal of the house—Miss Janet, as they calls her?” “Yes! but what is that to you?” replied the other, sternly. “It matters nothing whether they love or hate, so far as our business lies together. You are to labour to make that love fruitless, if so be there is love, but without troubling yourself to know or to inquire into the fact.” “Why, yes, that's true,” responded the other; “it don't matter this way or that, and—” They were interrupted at this moment by a distinct and repeated whistle,—just such a signal sound as had preceded the appearance of Mellichampe at the window of the hall. The tory put his hand upon the wrist of Blonay, while he bent forward his ear to the entrance —muttering to himself a moment after, as he again heard the signal, “Now, by Heaven! but this is audacious beyond example. The rebel is back again; a scare has no effect upon him, and nothing but shot will. Stay!” he exclaimed; “hear you nothing?” “A footstep, cappin; I think a foot coming down the steps.” And, even as he said, they both distinctly heard, the next moment, the tread of a foot cautiously set down, moving towards the back entrance of the house. Barsfield immediately sprang to the window of the apartment, and beheld, in the dim light just then bringing out the trees of the ground and garden into soft and shadowy relief, a slender figure stealing away towards the garden, carefully keeping as much as practicable in the shelter of the huge water-oaks that obscured the alley. A mingled feeling of exultation and anger spoke in his tone, as he exclaimed— “I have him now—the doe shall bring him to the hunter—he shall not escape me now! Hark you, Blonay, wait me here! I will get my sabre, and be with you instantly. It will be hard if we cannot manage him between us. But there must be no stir—no noise; what we do must be done by stratagem and our own force. Get yourself ready, therefore—your knife will answer, for your rifle will be of little use in the thick shrubbery of that garden. We must sneak, sir; no dove-hunting without sneaking.” With these words Barsfield left the apartment of the Half-Breed and proceeded to his own. The feelings of the former, however, scarcely responded to the sanguinary words of the latter. When alone, his soliloquy, brief and harsh, was yet new, seemingly, to his character. Hated and harried as he had been by all before, he had for the first time in his life been touched with the influence of a gentler power; and, muttering to himself during the absence of the tory, he disclosed a better feeling than any that we have been accustomed to behold in him. “If the gal loves him and he loves her, I won't spoil the sport atween 'em. She's a good gal, and had me to come to supper at the same table, when the cappin spoke agin it. She didn't laugh at me, nor stare at my eyes, as if I was a wild varmint; and she spoke to me jist as she spoke to other people. Adrat it! he may cut his enemy's throat for himself, I sha'n't; but then I needn't tell him so, neither;” and, as he spoke, he twirled the little purse of guineas in his pocket with a feeling of immense satisfaction. In a moment after Barsfield returned, and led the way cautiously by a circuitous track towards the garden. Let us now retrace briefly the steps we have taken, and observe the progress of some other of the persons in our narrative.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV. We have seen, pending the pursuit, that Mellichampe had coolly kept his way through the garden until he reached the forest that lay immediately behind it. Here he paused—he felt himself secure from any night search by such a force as that under Barsfield. A huge gum that forked within a few feet of its base, diverging then into distinct columns, afforded him a tolerable forest seat, into which, with a readiness that seemed to denote an old familiarity with its uses, the fugitive leaped with little difficulty. The undergrowth about him was luxuriant, and almost completely shut in the place of his concealment from every glance, however far-darting, of that bright moon which was now rising silently above the trees. But a sharper eye than hers had been upon the youth from the first moment of his flight from the garden. The trusty Thumbscrew was behind him, and a watcher, like himself. He had hurried from the conference with Humphries; and, heedful of his friend, for whose safety he felt all a parent's anxiety, he had pressed forward to the plantation of Mr. Berkeley, and to those portions of it in particular which, as they had been frequently traversed by both of them before, he well knew would be the resort of Mellichampe now. Still, though resolute to serve the youth, and having no more selfish object, he did not dare to offend him by exposing his person to his sight. He arrived at a convenient place of watch just as the pursuit of Barsfield was at its hottest. He saw the flight of the fugitive from the garden, and, himself concealed, beheld him take his old position in the crotch of the gum. His first impulse was to advance and show himself; but, knowing the nature of his companion well, he felt assured he should only give offence, and do no service. His cooler decision was to lie snugly where he was, and await the progress of events. At length the torches disappeared from the garden, and it was not long after when the lights seemed extinguished in the house—all but one; a candle—a pale and trembling light—was still to be seen in one window of the dwelling, and to this the eyes of Mellichampe turned with as fond a glance as ever Chaldean shepherd sent in worship to the star with which he held his fate to be connected. The light came from the chamber of Janet Berkeley. It was the light of love to Mellichampe, and it brought a sweet promise and a pleasant hope to his warm and active fancy. Not long could he remain in his quiet perch after beholding it. He leaped down, glided around the garden paling, and took his way to the park in front, keeping on the opposite side of the fence which divided the ground immediately about the dwelling from the forest and the fields. The fence, as is common to most fences of like description in the luxuriant regions of the south, was thickly girdled with brush, serving admirably the purpose of concealment. Pursuing it with this object, in all its windings, he at length approached the park where the British troops were encamped. Well and closely did he scan their position; and, with the eye of a partisan, he saw with how much ease a force of but half the number, properly guided, might effect their discomfiture. He did not linger, however, in idle regrets of his inability; but, moving around the chain of sentries, he ascertained that their position had undergone no alteration, and felt assured that he could now penetrate the garden safely. This done, he made his way back to the place of his concealment. In the examination which he had just taken, he had been closely watched and followed by the faithful 12 Thumbscrew. The movements of the youth regulated duly those of his attendant. When the former halted the latter fell back behind the brush, advancing when he advanced, and checking his own progress whenever the dusky shadow of Mellichampe appeared to linger even for an instant in the moonlight. He escaped detection. He played the scout with a dexterity and ease that seemed an instinct, and hovered thus around the footsteps of his daring friend throughout his whole progress, to and fro, in the adventures of that night. From the outside to the inside of the garden was but a step, and in a trice Mellichampe went over the fence. Watching heedfully until the youth was out of sight and hidden within its intricacies, Thumbscrew followed his example, and was soon wending after him, close along its shady alleys. A dense and double line of box, which, from having been long untrimmed, had grown up into so many trees, afforded an admirable cover; and, pausing at every turning, he looked forth only sufficiently often to keep the course of the lover for ever in his sight. In the meantime Mellichampe made his way to the garden entrance. Here he stopped with an unwonted degree of prudence, for which Thumbscrew gave him due credit; he forbore to press forward, as the latter feared he might do—seeking to cross the court, which, though interspersed with trees, was yet not sufficiently well covered to afford the necessary concealment. Keeping within the garden, therefore, he gave the signal, the first sounds of which chilled and warmed with contradictory emotions the bosom of the sweet maiden to whose ears it was addressed. The breath almost left her as she heard it, and she gasped with her apprehensions. “Too—too rash, Ernest!” she exclaimed in a low tone, as it reached her ears, and her hands were involuntarily clasped together. “Too rash—too daring—too heedless, for me as for thyself. Ah! dearly indeed am I taught how much you love me, when you make these reckless visits, when you wantonly brave these dangers! But I must go!” she exclaimed, hurriedly, as she heard the signal impatiently repeated; “I must go—I must meet him, or he will seek me here. He will rush into yet greater dangers; he will not heed these soldiers; and his old hatred to Barsfield, should he have distinguished him to-night, will prompt him, I fear me much, to seek him out even where his enemies are thickest.” Thus soliloquizing, she approached the couch where Rose Duncan was sleeping. “Rose—Rose!” She called to her without receiving any answer. Assured that she slept, Janet did not seek to disturb her, but, after a hurried prayer, which she uttered while kneeling by the bedside, she rose with new courage, and, without farther hesitation, unclosed the door, passed into the corridor, and descended to meet her daring lover. Little did she dream that the eyes of hate and jealousy were upon her,—that a malignant foe was no less watchful than a fervent lover,—that one stood in waiting, seeking her love, and, at the same time, no less earnestly desirous of the heart's blood of her lover. She emerged into the court, which she hurried over incautiously, and was received by Mellichampe at the entrance of the garden. He took her to his arms,—he led her away to the shelter of the great magnolias that towered in a frowning group from its centre; and the joy of their meeting, in that season and country of peril, almost took away the sting and the sorrow which had followed their separation, and now necessarily came with their present dangers. The happiness of Mellichampe was a tumult that could only speak in broken exclamations of delight; that of Janet was a subdued pleasure—a sort of bright, spiritual, moonlight gleam, that came stealing through clouds, was mingled with falling drops, that were only not oppressive as they seemed to fall from heaven. “Dear, dearest Janet—my own Janet—my only!— I have you at last; your hand is in mine,—your eyes look into my own. I cannot doubt that you are with me now. I believe it—I know it, by this newborn joy which is beating in my heart. Ah, dearest, but for that tory reptile, this rapture would have been mine before. But you are here at last, and, while you are with me, I will not think of him. I will think of nothing to vex,— I will know but one thought—but one feeling—the long-cherished, dearest of all, Janet,—the feeling of adoration, of devoted love, which my bosom bears for you.” The youth, as he spoke, had clasped her hands both in his, and his eyes looked for hers, which were cast down upon the grass below them. When she looked up, and they met his glance, he saw that they were glistening with tears. “You weep—you weep, Janet: I vex you with my love,—you are unhappy. Speak—say to me, dearest, what new affliction—what new strife and sorrow? What do these tears mean?—say out—I am used to hear of evil—it will not disturb me now. Is there any new stroke in store for me? Do not fear to name it—any thing,—only, only, Janet, if I am to suffer, let it not be your hand which is to deal it.” “There is none—none that I have to deal—none that I know of—” “Then there is none—none that should trouble me— none that should make you weep. No tears, Janet, I pray you. We meet so seldom, that there should be no cloud over our meeting. See, love, how clear, how beautiful is this night. There were several clouds hanging about the moon at her rising, but they are all gone, and now hang like so much silver canopy above her head: she is almost full and round; and there is something of promise in her smile for us,—so, dearest, it appears to me. Smile with me, smile with her, my beloved, and forget your griefs, and dismiss your tears.” “Alas, Ernest! how can I smile when all things alarm me for you? The pursuit to-night,—your vindictive enemy Barsfield,—oh, Ernest, why will you be so headstrong—so rash?” “There is no danger. I fear him not, Janet; but he shall learn to fear me,—he does fear me, and hence it is that he hates and pursues me. But the fugitive will turn upon his pursuer yet. The time is coming, and, by the God of heaven—” She put her hand upon his arm, and looked appealingly into his eyes, but spoke not. “Well, well, say nothing—forgive me, dearest—I will speak no more of him—I will not vex you with his name; you are now sufficiently vexed with his presence: but the time will come, Janet, and, by Heaven—if I mistake not greatly Heaven's justice—it cannot be far off, when he shall render me a fearful account of all his doings to me and mine. He has now the power—the men, the arms,—but there will be some lucky hour which shall find him unprovided, when—” She again appealed to the youth, whose impetuosity was again becoming conspicuous. “You promised me, Ernest.” “Forgive me, dearest—I did promise you, and I will forbear to speak of the reptile; but my blood boils when I but hear his name, and I forget myself for the moment.” “Ah, Ernest, you are but too prone to forgetting.” “Perhaps so, Janet: your charge is true; but you I never forget; my love for you goes along with every thought, and forms a part of the predominant mood, whatever that may be. Thus, even when I think of this man, whose name inflames my blood until I pant for the shedding of his, one of the influences which stimulates my anger is the thought of you. He comes between us,—he fills your father's mind with hostility to me; and he seeks you, Janet—he seeks you for his own.” 12* “Nay, Ernest, why should you think so? He has made no avowal; and I am sure the regard of my father for you has undergone no change.” “It is so, nevertheless; and your father is too weak and too timid, whatever may be his affections, to venture to maintain opinions in hostility to those who command him when they please. He has denounced me to your father, that I know,—he seeks you, I believe,— and much I fear me, Janet, your father will yield to his suggestions in all cases, and both of us will become the victims.” As the youth thus addressed her, the tears departed from her eyes, and the expression which followed upon her face was calm and pleasantly composed. There was no rigidity in its muscles; each feature seemed to maintain its natural place; and her words were slow, and uttered in the gentlest tones. “Have no fear of this, Ernest, I pray you. Should this man—should my father—should all, so far mistake me as to entertain a thought that I could yield to a union with Barsfield, do not you mistake me. I will not vow to you, Ernest; I have no protestations to make—I know not how to make them; but you will understand, and you will believe me in the assurance which I now give you, that I cannot hold my senses and consent to any connexion with the person you speak of.” “Bless you, dear Janet, but I needed no such assurance. I only feared that you might be driven by circumstances, by trick, by contrivances, to make a sacrifice of yourself for the good of another.” “Alas, Ernest—I now know what you would say. You would tell me that my father, at the mercy of this man, as he is, may require me as the offering by which he is to be saved. God help me! it is a strait I have not thought upon—I will not—I dare not think upon it! Let us speak no more of this.” Gloomily and sternly the youth replied— “But you will think upon it, Janet; it may be required of you ere long. Think upon it, and provide your strength.” “God forbid, Ernest; God forbid! Let me die first. Let me perish before it becomes a question with me, whether to sacrifice peace, hope, the proper delicacy of my sex, and all that I live for, and all that I would love, to the safety of an only parent. Oh, how false I should be to promise love to a being whom I could only hate or despise. What a daughter could I be to resist the prayers of a father requiring me to do so. Alas, Ernest! you bring me every form of trial. You make me most unhappy. You come rashly into the clutches of your deadly foe, and I tremble hourly, however I may rejoice, when I hear that you are coming. I dread to see you perish before my eyes under the weapons of these men; and, when you come, what is it that I am compelled to hear! what fears are before me—what horrors! Ah, if love be a treasure—if it be a joy to love and to be loved, it is so much the harder to think hourly of its loss, and of its so unguarded condition. Better not to feel—better to be hollow-hearted and insensible, than thus continually to dread, and as continually to desire— to fear with every hope, and to weep even where you would smile the most.” She buried her face in his bosom as she spoke, and her sobs were audible. His arm gently supported while enclasping her, and her afflictions greatly tended to subdue the impetuous character of his previous mood. He replied to her fondly, in those low tones which only the rich sensibility can understand, and the generous, warm spirit employ understandingly. “And yet, dearest, those very sorrows have a sweetness. Privation, pain, denial, even the lost love, Janet, are nothing to the choice spirit which has faith along with its sympathy. What consoles me? What has consoled me in the perils and the pains, the losses and the sorrows, which I have undergone in this warfare, and within the last two years? My confidence in you—my perfect faith that, however desolate, poor, denied, and desperate; however parted by enemies or distance, I was still secure of your love. I still knew that nothing— no, not even death, my Janet, could deprive me of that. If you have that confidence in me, my beloved, these sorrows, these trials, are only so many strengtheners. You will then find that the sorrows of love, borne well and without despondence, are the sweetest triumphs of the true affection. They are the honours which time can never tarnish; they are the spoils which last us for ever after. Janet, if, like you, I doubted—if I did not feel assured of your unperishing truth—I should rush this night, madly, and with but one hope of death, upon the swords of these tory troopers. I should freely perish under your eyes, with but one prayer, that you might be able to behold me to the last.” “Speak not thus!” she exclaimed, with a shudder, looking around her as she spoke; “and do not think, Ernest, from what I have said, that I have not the same perfect faith in you that you feel in me;—but I despair of all our hope. I am truly a timid maiden, and I am always fancying a thousand woes and sorrows. I cannot dare to believe otherwise than that our loves are unblessed—I cannot hope that we shall realize them: and oh, Ernest, your rashness, more than all things beside, tends to confirm in me these apprehensions. Why will you come to me when your enemies are abroad? Promise me, dear Ernest, to fly from this neighbourhood until the danger has gone over. There is no dishonour —none.” “Ay, but there is, Janet; but of this we need say nothing. I could tell you much of friends, and good service to be done, but may not. Let us speak of more pleasant matters: of our hopes, not of our fears: of our joys, not of our sorrows; of the future, too, in exclusion of the present.” And thus, loving and well beloved, the two discoursed together; she sadly and despondingly, but with a true devotedness of heart throughout; and he, warm in all things, impetuously urging his love, his hope, his hatred to his enemies, his promises of vengeance, and his fixed determination to pursue the war in the neighbourhood, in spite even of her solicitations that he should fly to a region of greater security. Thumbscrew, meanwhile, had been any thing but remiss in his guard. He had cautiously pursued his youthful associate, keeping close upon his heels, yet narrowly watching to avoid discovery. Though a bold and daring man, he yet esteemed the feelings and desires of Mellichampe with a sentiment of respect little short of awe; the natural sentiment of one, brought up as he had been, to regard the family of his wealthy neighbour as superior beings in many respects. Apart from this, the quick, impetuous spirit of the youth exacted its own observance; and, as his commands had been positive to his comrade not to attend him, and urged in a manner sufficiently emphatic to enforce respect, the more humble companion felt the necessity of seeming submissive at least. We have seen that his regard trampled over his obedience, and it was well perhaps that it did so. It was not long that Thumbscrew had maintained his watch, before his quick ear detected the approach of footsteps. He ventured to peep out from his bush, and he was able to see the distinct outline of the intruder's person. He saw him approach the long alley in which he himself was sheltered, and within a few paces of the lovers; and he immediately changed his own position. Barsfield—for it was he—came on, passed the spot which sheltered the scout, and, stealing heedfully around a clump of orange, made his way to the rear of the thick bower in which Janet and Mellichampe were seated. The scout tracked him with no less caution and much more adroitness. He placed himself in cover, and coolly awaited the progress of events. The impatient spirit of Barsfield did not suffer him to wait long. The tory, it is probable, heard something of the dialogue between the two, and his movement seemed prompted at the particular moment when it took place by some remark of Mellichampe which, from the exclamation of Barsfield as he rushed upon the youth, had touched the eavesdropper nearly. Leaping forward from behind one of the magnolias where he had been screened, with drawn sword, and a movement sufficiently hurried to pass the ground which separated them in the course of a few seconds, he cried to his rival in a bitter but suppressed tone of voice, “You shall pay dearly for that lie, Mellichampe.” In the next moment, a buffet from an unseen hand, that might have felled an ox, saluted his ear, and he stumbled unharmingly forward at the feet of the man whom he had sought to slay. “Save me,—oh, Ernest, save me,—fly—fly,—away, Ernest,—it is Barsfield!” Screaming thus, at the first alarm, the maiden clung to the youth, and trembled with affright. He, on the instant, had drawn his dirk, and, putting her aside almost sternly, threw himself upon the half-stunned person of the tory: but his hand was seized by the watchful attendant. “Let me fix him, Airnest, boy,—I knows how to manage the varmint.” “You here, Witherspoon?” demanded the youth. “As you see him, Airnest,—but take care of the gal, and send her safe home and quietly to bed. Ax pardon, Miss Janet, for scaring you, but 'twas the only way to manage the critter; but you had better run now, while I put what I calls my screwbolt upon the tory's jaw. Airnest, boy, let me have your handkerchief, since I may want another. There.” With his knee upon the bosom of the tory, he busied himself meanwhile in bandaging his mouth. The intruder did not submit quietly, but began to show some few signs of dissatisfaction. His movement provoked an additional pressure of the knee of his assailant upon his breast, while the huge handkerchief which was employed upon his mouth, as he endeavoured to cry out, was thrust incontinently into it. He was a child in the hands of his captor. “Easy now, Mr. Barsfield,—be quiet and onconsarned, and no harm shall come to you; but, if you're at all obstropolous, I shall be bound to take up a stitch or two in your jaw here, that'll be mighty disagreeable to both of us. Airnest, now, boy, don't stop for last words, but let's be off, or we'll have all the cubs looking after the great bear. I'll hold the lad quiet till you see the gal safe to the gate, but don't go further.” He kept his word and his good-nature, in spite of all the struggles of his prisoner. Once, and once only, he seemed to become angry, as the tory gave him something more than the customary annoyance; but a judicious obtrusion of a monstrous knife, which was made to flash in the moonlight before the eyes of the captive, was thought sufficient by the scout in the way of exhortation. “It's a nasty fine piece of steel, now, captain, and if you gives me much more trouble I shall let you have a small taste of its qualities; so you had better lay still till I lets you off, which won't be long, for you're of no more use to me here than a dead 'possum in a hollow thirty miles off. If I had you in the swamp now, I could drive a little trade in your skin. I could swap you for some better man than yourself; but I'm your friend here, for, to say the gospel truth to you, captain, if I didn't stand between you and Airnest Mellichampe, you wouldn't see what hurt you: he'd be through you like a ground mole, though in much shorter time; and there wouldn't be an inch of your heart that his dirk wouldn't bite into. But you're safe, you see, as you're my prisoner—the captive, as they used to say in old times, of my bow and spear—though, to be sure, it was only my fist that did your business.” It was thus that, like a good companion as he was, Thumbscrew regaled the ears of his prisoner with a commentary upon the particulars of his situation. In the meantime Mellichampe conducted, or rather supported, the maiden to the garden entrance. When there she recovered her strength, as she perceived that he designed attending her to the dwelling. This she resisted. “No, Ernest, no!—risk no more,—I will not see— I will not suffer it. Let us part now—in danger still, as we have ever been. In sorrow let us separate,— alas! I fear, in sorrow to meet again, if again we ever meet.” “Speak not thus,” he replied, hoarsely;—“why these sad misgivings—is our love so much a sorrow, my Janet?” “Sorrow or pleasure, Ernest, it is still our love—a love that I shall die in, and fear not to die for. But do not linger, I pray you; remember that Witherspoon is waiting for your return before he can release that man.” “Release him!” was the stern exclamation, and a fierce but suppressed laugh of bitterness fell from the lips of Mellichampe with the words. “Ay, release him, Ernest. What mean you by those words—that laugh? Surely, surely, Ernest, you do not mean him harm?” “Would he not harm us?—has he not harmed me already? Janet, you must remember—I had a father once.” “I do—I do; but oh, Ernest, dismiss your thoughts, which I see are fearful now. Promise me, Ernest, that you will do this man no harm.” Her hand earnestly pressed his arm as she entreated him. He was silent. “Ernest,” she exclaimed, solemnly,—“Ernest— remember! the hand of Janet Berkeley can never be won by crime.” He released her hand, which till this moment he had held. There was a strife going on within his bosom. She gazed on him suspiciously, and with terror. “I leave you, Ernest,” she whispered,—“I leave you; but do that man no harm.” There was a solemnity in her tones that rebuked his thoughts. She was leaving him, but turned back with a gentler tone— “I doubt you not, dear Ernest—I doubt you not now. Forgive me that I did so for an instant; and, oh, Ernest, come not again into this neighbourhood till these men are gone. Promise me—promise me, dear Ernest.” What would not love promise at such a moment? Mellichampe promised—he knew not what. His thoughts were elsewhere; and he felt not, that, in kissing her cheek as they parted, his lips had borne away her tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV. During the momentary absence of Mellichampe, his trusty associate had been equally busy with himself. He had completely gagged his prisoner with a handkerchief of no common dimensions, and not remarkable for the delicacy of its texture. He had finished this labour with a facility that was marvellous, and seemed to speak loudly for his frequent practice in such matters. This done, he took his seat composedly enough upon the body of the tory, and in this manner awaited the return of Mellichampe. Barsfield, meanwhile, though Vol. I.—G 13 at first a little uneasy and obstreperous, soon found it necessary to muster all his philosophy in the endurance of an evil that seemed unavoidable for the present. The huge, keen knife of the woodman glared threateningly in his eyes, and he saw that his efforts to escape, in more than one instance already, had provoked an expression of anger from his captor, who at other moments seemed good-natured and indulgent enough. The tory consoled himself, however, with the thought that Blonay could not be far off; and that, having made the circuit of the garden, as it had been appointed to him to do, he would soon come to his assistance and release. With this reflection, though burning for vengeance all the while, he was content to keep as quiet as was consistent with a position so very uneasy and unusual. The fierce mood of Mellichampe was in action on his return: there was a terrible strife going on within his heart. A sanguinary thirst was striving there for mastery, opposed strongly, it is true, but not efficiently, by a just sense of human feeling not less than of propriety. But there was no calm deliberation, and his passions triumphed. All his more violent and vexing impulses were active and in dictation. His eye was full of desperate intention: his hand grasped his bared dagger, and his movement was hurried towards the prisoner, whose eye turned appealingly to that of Witherspoon. The latter had his own apprehensions, but he had his decision also. He saw the manner of Mellichampe's approach; he understood directly the dreadful language which was uttered from his eye, though sleeping upon his lips; and he prepared himself accordingly to encounter and resist the movement which the glance of his comrade evidently meditated. He was scarcely quick enough for this. A sudden and fierce bound, like that which the catamount makes from his tree upon the shoulders of his approaching victim, carried the form of Mellichampe full upon the breast of the tory, who strove, but vainly, to shrink away from beneath. The impetuous movement half displaced the woodman. In another moment the weapon must have been in the throat of the tory, but for the ready effort and athletic arms of Witherspoon. He grasped the youth from behind. His embrace encircled completely, while securing him from the commission of the deed. “Release me, Witherspoon,” cried Mellichampe to his companion, while the thick foam gathered about his lips and half choked his utterance. “I'll be God darned if I do, Airnest,” was the decisive reply. The youth insisted,—the woodman was inflexible. “You will repent it, Witherspoon.” “Can't be helped, Airnest, but I can't think to let you go to do murder. 'Taint right, Airnest; and dang my buttons if any man that I calls my friend shall do wrong when I'm standing by, if so be I can keep his hands off.” “Shall this wretch always cross my path, John Witherspoon?—shall he always go unpunished? Does he not even now seek my life—his hands not yet clean from the blood of my father? Release me, Witherspoon—it will be worse if you do not.” “That's my look-out, Airnest, I know; it's the risk I runs always, and it's no new thing. But, Airnest, I can't let you go, onless you'll promise not to use your knife. The fellow desarves the knife, I reckon; but, you see, he's a prisoner, and can't do nothing for himself. It ain't the business of a sodger and a decent man to hurt a critter that can't fend off.” “A reptile—a viper, who will sting your heel the moment you take it from his head!” “Maybe; but he's my prisoner, Airnest.” “Why, what can you do with him?—you can't carry him with you?” “No, Airnest; but that's no reason that I should kill him.” G 2 “What will you do with him, then?” inquired the youth. “Leave him here—jist where he is, on the flat of his back, and mighty oncomfortable.” “Indeed!—to pursue us, and, by his cries, direct his hounds upon our heels? Let him rise, rather,—give him his sword, and let him fight it out with me in the neighbouring wood.” “Not so fast, Airnest—that'll be a scheme that would only hobble both of us; and I'm not going to risk any such contrivance. I have a much better notion than that, if you'll only hear to reason; and all I axes of you is, jist to keep your knife ready at the chap's throat, but not to use it, onless he moves and gits obstropolous. Say you'll do that now, while I takes a turn or two upon my shadow, and I'll let you loose.” The youth hesitated. The woodman went on— “You mought as well, Airnest, for I'm not guine to loose you onless you says you won't hurt the critter. Say so, Airnest, and I'll fix him so he can't follow us or make any fuss.” Finding that his companion was inflexible, and most probably somewhat subdued by this time, and conscious of the crime he had striven to commit, Mellichampe consented, though still reluctantly, and the moment after he was released. The woodman rose and began to make some farther preparations for the securing of his prisoner. Meanwhile, with his knee firmly fastened upon the breast of the tory, and his dagger uplifted and in readiness, the eyes of the youth were fastened with all the demon glare of hatred and revenge upon those of the man below him. The feelings of Barsfield under such circumstances were any thing but enviable. Accustomed to judge of men by his own nature, he saw no reason to feel satisfied that Mellichampe would keep the promise of forbearance which he had made to his companion; and yet he dreaded to exhibit emotion or anxiety, for fear of giving him sufficient excuse for not doing so. His emotions may well be inferred from the natural apprehensions of such a situation; and his base soul sunk into yet deeper shame, as he lay trembling beneath his enemy, dreading the death which was above him, and which he well knew he so richly deserved. But Thumbscrew was considerate, and did not long keep the tory in suspense. In the few moments in which he had withdrawn himself from the person of the prisoner, he had made sundry arrangements for better securing him; and, with a cord of moderate length, which he had drawn from a capacious pocket, he constructed a running noose, or slip-knot, with which he now approached the prisoner; speaking in a low tone of soliloquy all the while, as much, seemingly, for Barsfield's edification as for his own. “I will jist make bold, Cappin Barsfield, to give you a hitch or two in the way of friendship. You shall have as fast binding a title to this little bit of a bed as time and present sarcumstances will permit. It's only for your safe keeping and our safe running, you see, that I does it. I'll hitch up your legs—there, don't be scared, they shall go together—to this same bench here: and that, you see, will keep them from coming too close after ours. And as for the little bandage over your arms, why, you'll have to wear it a little longer, though it's too good a rag for me to leave behind. There—don't jerk or jump now, for it will soon be done. I'm mighty quick fixing such matters as these, and it takes me no time to hitch up a full-blooded tory when once I gits my thumb and forefinger upon him. There.” Thus muttering, he lashed the legs of the prisoner to one of the rude seats under the magnolias; and, freeing his companion from the farther restraints of his watch, the two prepared to start—Witherspoon, unseen by Mellichampe, having first possessed himself of the sword of the tory, which he appropriated with all the 13* composure of a veteran scout. They soon found their way out of the garden, through the darkest of its alleys, and they could not have gone far into the forest when Blonay, who seemed to have timed his movements with admirable accuracy, approached the spot where Barsfield lay struggling. The tory was completely in the toils—his feet and hands tied securely, and his mouth so bandaged that but a slight moaning was suffered at intervals to escape him in his efforts at speech. With well-acted zeal and a highly becoming indignation, Blonay, as soon as he discerned the situation of his employer, busied himself at his release. Enraged at the humiliation to which he had been subjected, and at the escape of his enemy, Barsfield demanded why he had not come sooner. But to this the other had his answer. He had followed the tory's directions, and had kept the lower fence of the garden winding into the woods, and had crossed it at a point which had been designated for him; by which it had been Barsfield's hope, that, flying from him, the fugitive must be encountered by his coadjutor. “You went too far round,” said the commander, sullenly; “and yet they are but a few moments gone. You say you have not seen them?” The answer was negative. “It is strange: but, by G—d, it shall not always be thus. Come with me, sir; I will talk with you in my chamber.” And they retired to confer upon the scheme which the tory had proposed to Blonay just before the adventure of the garden. We will now leave them and return to the fugitives, who were already far away upon their flight to the spot where their horses had been hidden. The first words of Mellichampe to his companion were those of reproach— “Why did you follow me when I forbade it, John Witherspoon?” “Well, now, Airnest, I think that's no sort of a question, seeing the good that's come of my following.” “True, you have served me, and perhaps saved me; but what will Janet think of me when she recovers from her fright? She will think I brought you there, and that you overheard what passed between us.” “Well, she'll think wrong, Airnest, if she does. It's true, I did hear a good deal, but that was owing to the needcessity of being close upon the haunches of that other chap. As a true man, Airnest, I never wanted to hear, and I did not get close enough to hear, till that skunk come out from behind the pear-tree, and I saw him sneaking round to the magnolias. Then it was I came out too, and only then it was I heard the talk between you.” “It matters not now, Witherspoon; my fear is that it may pain Janet to suppose that my friends are brought to overhear that language which a young lady should only think to herself, and can only utter to one; and no motive of regard for my safety, though so far warranted by circumstances as upon the present occasion, should have prompted you to do so.” “But I had another reason, Airnest, that is a good reason, I know. Just after I left you came one of Marion's road-riders, Humphries, you know, calling in the scouts; and you're wanted, and I'm wanted, and we're all of us wanted, for there's to be a power of the tories gathering in two days at Baynton's Meadow, and the `fox' is mighty hungry to git at 'em. I have the marks and the signals, and we must push on directly. It'll take us three good hours more to work our way into the swamp.” “Ah! then we have little time to waste,” was the prompt reply; and, scouring down the road, they came to the broken branch which lay across the path, and indicated by its own the position of its fellow. Following the directions given by Humphries, they were soon met by the line of sentinels, and the path grew cheery after a while, when the occasional challenge, and the distant hum and stir of an encampment, announced the proximity of Marion in his wild swamp dwelling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI. The reflections of Barsfield were by no means consolatory or grateful on his return to the mansion. A few moments were devoted to Blonay, of whom the tory felt perfectly secure, and the two then separated for the night, seeking their several chambers. In the morning the latter was up betimes, and, descending to the breakfast-room, the first person who encountered his glance was the fair Janet Berkeley. She was alone. A slight flush overspread her cheek as he entered the apartment; but he was not the person exactly who could greatly disturb her equanimity. Her eye was cold and unshrinking, and her courtesy as easy, unconstrained, and distant as ever. The case was widely different with him. He started as he beheld her—turned away without the usual salutation—then, suddenly conscious of his rudeness, he wheeled round, as if about to charge an enemy, confronted her valiantly enough, and bowed stiffly, and with evident effort. For a few moments no word passed between the two, and this time was employed by Barsfield in pacing to and fro along the apartment. At length, muttering something to himself, the sounds of which were only just audible to the maiden, he walked into the corridor, looked hastily around, and then quickly, as if he wished to anticipate intrusion, re-entered the room, and at once approached the maiden. “Miss Berkeley,” he said, “it is unnecessary that I should remind you of last evening's adventure. The circumstances cannot have been forgotten, though the singular composure of your countenance this morning would seem to imply a strange lack of memory on your part, or a far stranger indifference to its intimations.” He paused, as if in expectation of some reply, and she did not suffer him long to wait. Her response was instantaneous, and her equable expression of countenance unbroken. “There is nothing strange, sir, I believe, if you will consider well the subject of which you speak. I know of no circumstances so strong in my memory which should disturb my composure, however some of them may affect yours. Are you not suffering from some mistake, sir?” “Scarcely, scarcely, Miss Berkeley,” he exclaimed, hurriedly; “though, I must confess, your reply astounds me not less now than your composure at our first meeting. Will you pretend, Miss Berkeley, that you were not in the garden at a late hour of last night?” “I saw, sir, that you must labour under some mistake, and such is certainly the case when you presume to examine me thus. But I will relieve the curiosity which seems to have superseded all your notions of propriety, and at once say that I was in the garden last night.” “'Tis well—and there you saw another.” “True, sir. I then and there saw another.” “A rebel—a lurking rebel, Miss Berkeley.” “A brave man, a gentleman, an honest citizen, sir. My friend—my father's friend—” “Say not so, for your father's sake, Miss Berkeley, I pray you. It would greatly endanger the safety of your father, were it known in the councils of Cornwallis that the son of the notorious Max Mellichampe was his friend; and, still more, were it known that they were in intimate communion.” G 3 “I said not that, Captain Barsfield, I said not that,” was the hasty reply of Janet, in tones and with a manner that showed how much she apprehended the consequences which might arise from such an interpretation of her remark. Barsfield smiled when he saw this, as he felt the consciousness of that power which her words had given him over her. She continued—“Do not, I pray you, think for a moment that my father knows any thing of the visits of Mr. Mellichampe. He came only to see me—” The tory interrupted her with a sarcastic smile and speech— “And I am to understand that the dutiful Miss Berkeley consents to receive the visits of a gentleman without the concurrence, and against the will, of her father?—a dilemma, is it not, Miss Berkeley?” “I will not submit to be questioned, sir,” was her prompt reply; and her eye glanced a haughty fire, before which that of the lowly-bred tory quailed utterly. “You again mistake me, sir, and do injustice to my father, when you venture such an inquisition into my habits. I am free, sir, to act as my own sense and discretion shall counsel. My father is not unwilling that I should obey my own tastes and desires in the selection of my associates, and to him alone am I willing to account.” She turned away as she spoke, and busied herself, or seemed to busy herself, with some of the affairs of the household, with the object, evidently, of arresting all farther conversation. But, with the pause of a few moments, in which he seemed to be adjusting in his own mind the doubt and difficulty, Barsfield put on an air of decision, and readvanced to the maiden. “Hear me but a few moments, Miss Berkeley, and be not impatient—and, should any of my words be productive of annoyance, I pray you to overlook them, in consideration of the difficulties which, as you will see, may soon lie before you.” “Difficulties!—but go on, sir.” “I need not say that I was a witness to your conference with this young man last night.” “You need not, sir,” was her reply, with a manner that gave life to the few words she uttered. A scowl went over the tory's face, obscuring it for a moment, but he recovered instantly. “I heard you both, and I felt sorry that you should have risked your affections so unprofitably.” The maiden smiled her acknowledgments, and he proceeded— “Fortunately, however, for you at least, such ties as these, particularly where the parties are so young as in the present instance, are of no great strength, and are seldom durable. They can be broken, and usually are, with little detriment to either party.” “I purpose, on my part, sir, nothing of the kind,” was her cool reply, interrupting him, as he was about to continue in a speech of so much effrontery, and which was so little gratifying to his auditor; “I purpose not to try the strength or durability of any of the ties which I have made, Captain Barsfield.” “But you will, Miss Berkeley—you must, as soon as you discover that such ties are unprofitable, and beyond any hope of realization. The man with whom your pledge is exchanged is a doomed man!” “How, sir?—speak!” “He fights with a halter about his neck, and his appearance last night in the neighbourhood of my troop is of itself sufficient for his condemnation, as it leads to his conviction as a spy.” “I can share his doom, Captain Barsfield, though I believe not that such is within your power. I cannot think that Lord Cornwallis has conferred upon you any such authority.” “This parchment, this commission, and these more expressive orders, Miss Berkeley, would tell you even more—would tell you that your own father is at my mercy at this very moment, as one, under your own avowal, privy to the presence of a rebel as a spy upon my command. My power gives me jurisdiction even over his life, as you might here read for yourself, were not my words sufficient.” “They are not—they are not,” she exclaimed, hastily, and trembling all over. “I will not believe it; let me see the paper.” “Pardon me, Miss Berkeley, but I may not now. It is sufficient for me that I know the extent of my power, and its limits. It is not necessary that I should unfold it.” “I will not believe it, then—I will not trust a word that you have said. I cannot think that the British general can have thought a thing so barbarous—so dishonourable.” “It is so, nevertheless, Miss Berkeley; but there will be little or no danger to the father, if the daughter will listen to reason. Will you hear me?” “Can I do less, Captain Barsfield?—go on, sir.” “I accept the permission, however ungraciously given. Hear me, then. These vows—the ties of childhood, and restraining none but children—can hardly be considered, when circumstances so bear against them. I have a perfect knowledge of all the circumstances between yourself and this rebel Mellichampe.” “You have not said, sir, and I marvel at the omission, with what wonderful ingenuity your knowledge was obtained.” “Your sarcasm is pointless, Miss Berkeley, when we know that a time like the present not only sanctions, but calls for and commands, all those little arts by which intelligence of one's enemies is to be obtained. Is it my offence or my good fortune to have heard more than concerned the cause for which I contend? Certainly not my offence—it is for you to say how far it may be for my good fortune.” “To the point—to the point, Captain Barsfield, if you please.” “It is quite as well,” he responded, with a sullen air of determination, as the impatient manner of Janet showed how unwillingly she listened; “'tis quite as well that I should; and all I ask from you now, Miss Berkeley, is simply that you should heed and deliberate upon what I unfold, and make no rash nor ill-considered decision upon it. First, then, let me say, that your father is in my power—but in mine alone. I am willing to be his friend henceforward, as I have been heretofore. I am able and desirous to protect him, as well against the rebels as from the injustice of such loyalists as might presume upon his weakness to do him wrong; but I am not sufficiently his friend, or my own enemy, to do all this without some equivalent—there must be a consideration.” He paused; and, as the maiden perceived it, she spoke, while a smile of the most provoking indifference, suddenly, though for a moment only, curled the otherwise calm and dignified folds of her lips— “I can almost conjecture what you would say, Captain Barsfield; but speak on, sir, I pray you—let there be an end of this.” “I can scruple little to say out what you assume to have conjectured so readily, Miss Berkeley; and I speak my equivalent the more readily, as you seem so well prepared to hear it. You, then, are the equivalent for this good service, Miss Berkeley. Your hand will be my sufficient reward, and my good services shall ever after be with your father for his protection and assistance.” “Think of something else, Captain Barsfield,” she replied, with the utmost gravity; “something better worthy of the service—something better suited to you. I am not ambitious, sir, of the distinction you would confer upon me. My hopes are humble, my desires few; 14 and my father—but here he comes. I will speak of this affair no farther.” And she turned away with the words, just as the old man, entering, met the baffled tory with some usual inquiry as to the manner in which he had slept, and if his bed had been pleasant; and all with that provoking simplicity that was only the more annoying to Barsfield, as it brought the commonest matters of daily life into contrast and collision with those more important and interesting ones, in the discussion and urging of which he had but a few moments before been so earnest. He replied as well as he could to the old gentleman, who complained bitterly of his own restlessness during the night, and of strange noises that had beset his ears, and so forth—a long string of details, that silenced all around, without the usual advantage which such narrations possess, towards nightfall, of setting everybody to sleep. But the signal was now given for breakfast, and the lively Rose Duncan made her appearance, bright and smiling as ever; then came Lieutenant Clayton; and lastly, our old acquaintance Blonay. Breakfast was soon despatched, and was scarcely over when Barsfield, who had given orders for his troop to move, took Mr. Berkeley aside. Their conversation was long and earnest, though upon what subject remained, for a season at least, entirely unknown to the household. Janet, however, could not but remark that a deeper shadow rested upon the visage of her father; and even Rose Duncan, playful and thoughtless as she ever was, complained that during the whole day her uncle had never once asked her for a song, or challenged her to a game at draughts. “Something wrong, Janet,” she exclaimed to her companion, after freely remarking upon the condition of things; “something wrong, I'm certain. This tory lover of yours is at the bottom of it.” And, without pausing for reply, she whirled away in all the evolutions of the Meschianza, humming, like some errant bird, a wild song, that did not materially disagree with the capricious movement. Janet only answered with a sigh as she ascended to her chamber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII. Barsfield ordered a guard of ten men, and prepared to ride over to the “Kaddipah” plantation—the reward of his good services in the tory warfare. The distance between the two places was but five miles; and, in the present prostrate condition of Carolina affairs, ten men were deemed quite adequate for his protection. They might not have been, had the “swamp fox” been warned of his riding soon enough to have prepared a reception. Clayton was left in charge of the troop; and in no very pleasant humour did the tory proceed to leave the mansion of Mr. Berkeley. He had not, of late years, been much accustomed to contradictions of any sort; and his recent elevation, as an officer of the British army, tended still more to make him restiff under restraint or opposition. He was disappointed in the effect which he had promised himself to produce upon the mind of Janet Berkeley, from a dispaly of the power of which he was possessed, and still more annoyed at the cool, sarcastic temper which she had shown during their conference. Her frank avowal of the interest which she felt in Mellichampe,—the calm indifference with which she listened to his remarks upon the nocturnal interview with her lover,—and the consequences of that interview to himself,—these were all matters calculated to vex and imbitter his mood, as he rode forth from the spot in which they had taken place. His manner was stern, accordingly, to his lieutenant, Clayton, while giving him his orders, and haughty, in the last degree, to the men under him. Not so, however, was his treatment of Blonay, whom he heard calling familiarly to his dog, and who now stood ready, about to mount his tacky, as if going forth with himself. “You go with me, Mr. Blonay?” was his question to the Half-Breed, uttered in the mildest language. “Well, cappin, I reckon it's best that I should go 'long with you 'tell I can hear something of Marion's men. When I hears where to look for 'em I reckon I'll leave you, seeing it's no use for me to go scouting with a dozen.” “You are right,” was the response; “but fall behind till I send the men forward; I would have some talk with you.” Blonay curbed his pony, called in his dog, and patiently waited until, sending his men forward under a sergeant, Barsfield motioned him to follow with himself. “You were sadly at fault last night, Mr. Blonay,” was the first remark which he made to the Half-Breed, as they entered upon the avenue; “it is to be hoped that you will soon do better.” “'Tworn't my fault, cappin,—I did as you tell'd me,” was the quiet answer. “Well, perhaps so;—you are right, I believe. I did send you too far round. That confounded garden holds several acres.” “Five, I reckon,” said the other. Barsfield did not heed the remark, but abruptly addressed him on the subject which was most active in his thoughts. “You hold your mind, Mr. Blonay, I presume, for this adventure? You will undertake the business which I gave you in hand? You have no fears—no scruples?” “Well, I reckon it's a bargin, cappin. I'll do your business if so be I kin, and if so be it doesn't take me from my own. I puts my own first, cappin, you see, for 'twould be again natur if I didn't.” “You are perfectly right to do so; but I am in hope, and I believe, that you will soon find our business to lie together. If the enemy you seek be one of Marion's men, so is my enemy: should you find one, you will most probably get some clew to the other; and the one object, in this way, may help you to both.” “And you think, cappin, that Marion's men is in these parts?” “Think!—I know it. The appearance of this youth Mellichampe, with his cursed inseparable Witherspoon, as good as proves it to me. Not that they are strong, or in any force; on the contrary, my letters tell me that the rebels have in a great many instances deserted their leader, and gone into North Carolina. Indeed, they say he himself has gone; but this I believe not: he still lurks, I am convinced, in the swamp, with a small force, which we shall quickly ferret out when we have got our whole force together. To-morrow we go to meet our volunteer loyalists at `Baynton's Meadow,' where they assemble, and where I am to provide them with arms.” “There's a-many of them to be there, cappin?” was the inquiry of Blonay. “Two hundred or more. The wagons which you saw carry their supplies.” The tory captain, in this way, civilly enough responded to other questions of the Half-Breed, the object of which he did not see; and in this manner they conversed together until the guard had emerged from the avenue into the main road, and was now fully out of sight. Interested in giving to his companion as precise a description as possible of the person, the habits, and character of Mellichampe, which he did at intervals throughout the dialogue, Barsfield had moved on slowly, and had become rather regardless of the movement of his men, until, reaching the entrance of the avenue, he grew conscious of the distance between them, and immediately increased his pace. But Blonay did otherwise; he 14* drew up his pony at this point, and seemed indisposed to go forward. “Why do you stop?” cried the tory, looking back over his shoulder. The answer of Blonay satisfied him. “I forgot something, cappin,—the knife and the pass. I must go back, but I'll be after you mighty quick.” Without waiting for the assent of his employer, he started off on his return, pricking the sides of his pony with a degree of earnestness to which the little animal was not accustomed, and which he acknowledged by setting off at a rate which seemed infinitely beyond his capacities. Barsfield was satisfied to call to him to follow soon; and, putting the rowel to his own steed, he hurried forward to resume his place at the head of his men. But it was not the intention of Blonay to go back to the dwelling which he had so lately left. He was practising a very simple ruse upon his companion. He had forgotten nothing—neither knife nor passport; and his object was merely to be relieved from observation, and to pursue his farther journey alone. He had a good motive for this; and had resolved, with certain efficient reasons, which had come to him at the moment of leaving the avenue, to pursue a different route from that of the tory. After riding a little way up the avenue he came to a halt; and, giving the tory leader full time not only to reach his men, but to get out of sight and hearing with them, he coolly turned himself round and proceeded to the spot where they had separated. Here he alighted, and his keen eyes examined the road, and carefully inspected those tracks upon it, a casual glance at which, as he rode out with Barsfield, had determined him upon the course which he had taken. He looked at all the horse-tracks, and one freshly made in particular. The identical outline of shoe, which he had so closely noticed on the battle-ground of Dorchester, was obviously before him; and, remounting his horse, he followed it slowly and with certainty. Barsfield more than once looked round for his ally, but he looked in vain; and each step taken by both parties made the space greater between them. The Half-Breed kept his way, or rather that of his enemy, whom he followed with a spirit duly enlivened by a consciousness that he was now upon the direct track. In this pursuit the route of Blonay was circuitous in the extreme. He had proceeded but a mile or so along the main road, when the marks which guided him turned off into an old field, and led him to the very spot where we discovered Mellichampe and Witherspoon the day before. The keen eye of the Half-Breed soon discovered traces of a human haunt, but nothing calculated to arrest his progress, as the marks of the flying horseman were still onward. Obliquely from this point, still farther to the right, he entered a dense forest. Here he made his way with difficulty, only now and then catching the indent of the shoe. He soon emerged from the thick wood, and the path was then open. Here, too, he discovered that there had been an assemblage of persons, as the ground, in a little spot, was much beaten by hoofs, and still prominent among them was that which he sought in chief. This encouraged him; and, as the whole body assembled at the spot seemed to have kept together, he had little or no difficulty in continuing the search. At length the road grew somewhat miry and sloppy. Little bays at intervals crossed his path, through which the horsemen before him seemed to have gone without hesitation. The forests were now broken into hummocks, which were indented by small bodies of water. Here the cypress began to send up its pyramidal shapes; and groves of the tallest cane shot up in dense masses around it. The cressets lay green upon the surface of the dark pond, and the yellow and purple mosses of the festering banks presented themselves to his eyes in sufficient quantity to announce his proximity to the swamp. But to Blonay, thoroughly taught in all the intricacies of the “cypress,” its presence offered no discouragement whatsoever to the pursuit. At length, reaching an extensive pond, he lost all trace of the horses. He saw at once that they had entered the water; but where had they emerged? The opposite banks were crowded close to the water's edge with the thickest undergrowth, mingled with large trees, whose quiet seemed never to have been disturbed with the axe of the woodman or the horn of the hunter. The wild vine and the clustering brier, the slender but numerous canes, the gumshoots, cypress-knees or knobs, and the bay, seemed to have been welded together into a solid wall, defying the footsteps of any invader more bulky than the elastic blacksnake, or less vigorous and well-coated than the lusty bear. Blonay saw the impervious nature of the copse; but he also felt assured that the pursuit must lead him into and through it. He saw that through it the men must have gone whose footsteps he had followed, and he accordingly soon completed his resolves as to what he should himself do. He slowly led his horse back to a spot of land, the highest in the neighbourhood. Having done this, he fastened him to a shrub; then sought out one of the loftiest trees, which he ascended with habitual and long-tried dexterity. His elevation gave him a full and fine view of the expansive swamp before him. He looked down upon the pale, ghostly tops of the old cypresses, sprinkled with the green cedar: and here and there, where the sand was high enough to yield a bed sufficiently spacious for so comprehensive a body, the huge and high shaft of the colossal pine. These all lay before him—their tops flat, gently waving under his eye beneath the slight wind passing over them, making a prospect not less novel than imposing. But Blonay had no eye for the scene, and but little taste for the picturesque. He had sought his giddy perch for another purpose; and he was satisfied with the result of his labour when, at the distance of six or eight hundred yards from the entrance of the swamp, he detected a slight wreath of smoke curling up from among the trees, and spreading around like some giant tree itself, as if in protection over them. He noticed well in what direction the smoke arose, and quietly descended from his place of elevation. Keeping this direction constantly in mind, he now saw that the persons he pursued must have gone into the pond, and kept in it for some distance afterward, emerging at a point not at that moment within the scope of his vision. He doubted not that, following the same course, he should arrive once more upon their traces at some point of outlet and entrance. To conjecture thus, was, with him, to determine. He touched his pony smartly with his whip, and, whistling his dog to follow, plunged fearlessly into the pathless space, and his saddle-skirts were soon dipping in the yellow water. He kept forward, however, through the centre of the pond, and was soon gratified to find some appearances of an opening before him. On his right hand the pond swept round a point of land, making into the copse, and forming a way which was imperceptible at the place from whence he had originally started. He did not scruple to pursue it; and, passing through a narrow defile of water, over which the vines ran and clambered, thrusting their sharp points continually in his face, and making his progress necessarily slow, he at length ascended a little bank, and once more found the tracks which he had followed so far. Giving his little pony a few moments of rest, he again set forward; and, after an arduous progress of an hour, he began to hear sounds which imposed upon him the necessity of greater caution in his progress. The hum of collected men—their voices—the occasional neigh of the horse—the stroke of the axe, and now and then a shout, announced his proximity to the camp. He was within a few hundred yards of one of the famous retreats of the “swamp fox;” and, dismounting from his nag, which he carefully fastened in a secure place of concealment, he went forward on foot, only followed by his dog; moving slowly, and scrutinizing, as he did so, every tree and bush that might afford shelter to an enemy. He still advanced until he came to a small creek, which wound sinuously along before him, and which now formed the only barrier between himself and the retreat of the partisans. He saw their steeds in groups, fastened to the overhanging branches of the trees—he saw the troopers lying at length in similar places of shelter—some busied in the duties of the camp and of preparation—some taking their late breakfast, and others moving around as sentinels, one of whom paced to and from within thirty yards of the little copse from which he surveyed the scene in safety. It was while gazing intently on the personages constituting these several groups, that Blonay discovered his dog in rapid passage across a tree that lay partly over the creek which separated him from the encampment. Attracted, most probably, by the good savour and rich steams that arose from a huge fire, over which our old acquaintance, Tom, was providing the creature-comforts of the day, the dog made his way without looking behind him, and Blonay was quite too nigh the sentinels to venture to call him back either by word or whistle. Cursing the cur in muttered tones to himself, he drew back to a safer distance, still keeping in sight, however, of the entire circuit occupied by the partisans. Here he watched a goodly hour, taking care that no single movement escaped his eye; for, as he had now found out one of the secret paths leading directly to the haunt of an enemy so much dreaded as the “swamp fox,” he determined that his knowledge of all its localities should be complete, the better to enhance the value, and necessarily increase the reward, which he hoped to realize from its discovery to some one or other of the British leaders. Let us now penetrate the encampment itself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII. The hiding-place of Marion was admirably chosen in all respects, whether as regards convenience or security. It was a high ridge of land, well timbered, narrow and long, and running almost centrally in the swamp. Two or three outlets, known only to the partisans, and these, as we have seen in the one instance already described, intricate and difficult of access even to the initiated, were all that it possessed; and here, secure from danger, yet not remote from its encounter, if circumstances or their own desires so willed it, the “swamp fox” lay with his followers during brief intervals of that long strife in which he contended for his country. His force was feeble at this period. It consisted only of the small bands of natives, gathered under local officers chiefly from the lower country, none of whom had ever seen what was called regular service. He had been deserted by all the continentals with the exception of two, whom he had rescued from their British captors soon after the battle of Camden; but, though thus few in number, and feeble in exercise, the partisans, catching the full spirit of their leader, were never inactive. In the camp, while Blonay looked out on all hands for his particular victim, the stir of preparation was heard by the overlooking spy. Hurried orders were given, horses were put in preparation, swords were brandished, and rifles charged home. Amid all the bustle, there was still room for jest and merriment. Like boys just let loose from school, the men playfully gambolled over the plain,—some leaping, others hurling the bar, and some, less vigorously minded, busy in all the intricacies of a game of “old sledge.” But one person alone, of all the motley assemblage, appeared, on the present occasion, indisposed to take part in the labours and amusements going on. He sat aloof upon a log,—his sword across his thighs, his elbows upon his knees, his chin upon his palms, and his eyes bent wanderingly upon the several groups. This was none other than our ancient friend Porgy. He sat for some time in silence, and seemed only busy in the adjustment of some vexing thoughts. At length, calling Tom, the negro, to his aid, he relaxed from his rigid position, stretched himself off upon the log, and lay in waiting for the appearance of the black. The sooty fellow soon answered and obeyed the summons, and stood before the philosopher. “Tom, old boy,” said he, as soon as he beheld him, “Tom, can you tell me what to do for my horse,— he has an outrageous colic?” This was pronounced in a tone of infinite concern. With a sympathetic voice and manner, the black instantly responded— “You no say so, Mass Porgy?” “If I don't, Tom, I don't know what to say. He certainly has something that looks cursedly like it; and I've been considering what to do for it, but I'm at a loss. I am no horse-doctor.” “Speak Misser Oakenburgher,—him will tell you— him will gib you somting good for um.” “To kill the beast? No, no, Tom, that won't do neither. He must get well without Oakenburgher, or he dies quietly without physic. But is there nothing, Tom, which is usually given in such cases? You are the cook, Tom; and a good cook, Tom, ought to know what's good for the stomach even of a horse.” “I see dem gib hoss-drench, make wid whiskey, and soot, and salt; but whey you guine git salt here for hoss, and you no hab none for sodger?” “Where, indeed? The prospect is a sad one—and you say, Tom, that all the salt is gone that came up last week from Georgetown?” “Ebbry scrap ob 'em, mossa,—no hab 'nough to throw on bird tail if you want to catch 'em. Dis a bad country, Mass Porgy—no like de old cypress, whey you can lap up 'nough salt from de swamp to cure you meat for de year round, and season you hom'ny by looking at 'em only tree minutes by the sun.” “And you know nothing, Tom, that will ease the animal?” “No, mossa,—I see de buckrah gib drench heap time, but I nebber ax how he been make.” “Has Humphries come in yet, Tom?” “Long time, sir: he gone ober to Wolf Island wid de major 'bout two hours 'go, and muss be coming back directly; and, jist I speak, look at 'em, coming yonder, by de big gum!” “I see—I see. You may go now, Tom, and see to your dinner, which you had better get ready as soon as possible. I feel hungry already, in anticipation of a journey which I foresee we shall be called upon to make.” Tom disappeared, and, rising from his place of repose, Porgy moved slowly by the several groups, buckling on his sword as he went, and taking the route upon which Humphries was approaching. But the philosopher was not suffered to make his way quietly. A dozen voices arrested his attention, calling to him on all sides as he made his appearance, and labouring to secure his presence among them— “I say, sergeant—Sergeant Porgy!” He relaxed as this particular summons met his ear. It had something official in it. He turned to the speaker, and, without advancing, replied, Vol. I.—H 15 “I hear, I hear, man; do not think me so much deaf as indifferent. I would not hearken, but that you compel me to hear; and I will not heed, unless you speak quickly what you want, though you undo the drum of my ear by your howling. Speak out and have done with it, Dick Mason,—your bolt is soon shot, I reckon.” “Why, sergeant, what's the matter—you're mighty cross to-day? You haven't seen the sun shine, or not eaten breakfast, I reckon.” “Cross!—and well I may be, since here's my nag, as fine an animal as man would like to cross, racked with all the spasms of a most infernal colic. What can I do for him?—tell me that, and I'll listen to you all day, and sit up all night to answer your nonsense.” “Give him red pepper tea,” said one. “Soot and salt,” cried another. “Gunpowder and rum,” said a third. “Castor oil,” a fourth. And each had some suggestion, as much in jest, perhaps, as in earnest, of his own favourite specific. The approach of Humphries silenced much of this, and to him Porgy related his difficulties. The lieutenant coolly gave directions to one of the soldiers in attendance, and promised to relieve Porgy of his annoyance on this subject. “But, sergeant, you must get yourself in readiness as soon as possible.” “Well, Bill, what's to be done now?” “Fight, my old boy—fight!” “With whom?” “The tories.” “Where?” “At Baynton's Meadow, where there is to be a mighty gathering, and where they are to receive arms from town. We are to have smart work; though, as they're to have a barbecue and plenty of rum, we shall find them a more easy bargain.” “A barbecue, say you? The wretches! They to have a barbecue, and we compelled to eat—Tom!” “Sa!” “What are we to have for dinner to-day, old fellow?” “Some tripe, sir, and boil acorns, with hom'ny.” “Tripe, hommony, and boiled acorns; and they are to have a barbecue. I say, Humphries, there's something exceedingly unreasonable in such a distribution of the goods of Providence. But we must spoil them, Bill. We shall be able to come upon them—shall we not?— before they shall have touched the meat. I like vastly to take a first cut at a barbecue,—the nice gravy is then delicious; but, after a dozen seams have been made upon it, it imbibes a smoky flavour, and is not half so agreeable.” “But your nag, Porgy,—how will you do for him? He must stay to be physicked.” “True; but I will get the horse of that fellow that's sick,—old—what's his name—the German?” “Feutbeer:—well, he'll carry you safe enough; it will be for the tories to say if he will bring you back. But what's this?—ha!” Humphries started as the two approached the little hollow in which Tom carried on his preparations for the humble meal of the squad for which he provided. The trooper seized a rifle that stood against a tree beside him, and lifted it instantaneously to his eye. The muzzle of it rested upon the strange dog that burrowed amidst the offal strewn about the place, unnoticed by the busy cook who purveyed for him. Porgy was about to speak his wonderment at the sudden ferocity of mood exhibited by his companion, when, motioning him to be quiet, the trooper lowered the weapon, and called to John Davis, who was approaching at a little distance. “Davis,” said he, as the other came near, “do you know that dog?” “I do; but where I've seen him I can't say. I think I know him.” H 2 “And what do you say, Tom?” he said to the negro, in tones that startled him,—“don't you know that dog?” “He face is berry familiar, Mass Humphry, but I loss he recollection for ebber.” “That is the cur of old Mother Blonay—Goggle's mother, and the blear-eyed rascal must be in this very neighbourhood.” “Do you think so, Bill?” asked Davis. “Think so!—I know the dog, and why should he be here if the other were not? It must be so; and we are hunted. But we shall soon find out. Tom!” “Sa!” “Hit the dog a smart stroke suddenly with your stick, hard enough to scare him off, but not to hurt him much; and do you move to the edge of the creek, Davis, as soon as the dog runs off. That scoundrel, his master, must be in that direction, and we must see for him.” Thus ordering, he called two of the men, and sent them on the path directly opposite that taken by Davis, yet over the same creek. He himself prepared to strike the creek at a point equidistant from the two; and, as he advanced, he gave the signal to Tom, who, with right good-will, laid the flail over the back of the obtrusive animal, and with a force that sent him howling into the swamp. He took, as had been expected, the very path he came, and was soon running upon the log that partially crossed the creek, and in the direction in which he had left his master. But Blonay was not to be caught napping. He had one chief merit of a scout, and never went within smell and sound of an enemy's camp without keeping his wits well about him. He had marked the movement of Humphries towards his dog,—beheld the rifle uplifted, and the muzzle pointed at the animal's head,—and readily divined the motives which induced Humphries to forbear shooting him, and which finally led him to the movement subsequently determined upon. With this consciousness, the Half-Breed at once proceeded to a change of position. He left the advanced point from which he had watched the camp, and, running in a straight line about fifty yards above, turned suddenly about and kept a forward course in the direction of the spot at which he had first entered the swamp. But he did not take these precautions without some doubts of their adequacy to his concealment. He muttered his apprehensions of the keen scent of the dog, which he feared would too quickly find out his track, and lead his pursuers upon it; and, though he doubted not that he should be able to get out of the swamp before any of those after him, he was yet fully aware of the utter impossibility of escaping them on the high road, should any of them mount in pursuit. Though a hardy and fast animal, his pony was quite too small to overcome spae very rapidly; and the determination of Blonay was soon made, if he could mislead the dog, to seek a hiding-place in the swamp, which, from its great extent and impervious density in many places, he knew would conceal him, for a time, from any force which the partisans might send. He hurried on, therefore, taking the water at every opportunity, and leaving as infrequent a track as possible behind him. But he fled in vain from the sagacious and true scent of his dog. From place to place, true in every change, the cur kept on after him, giving forth, as he fled, an occasional yelp of dissatisfaction or chagrin, as much probably on account of the beating he had received as from not finding his master. “Adrat the pup—there's no losing him. Now, if I had my hand on him, I should knife him, and that's the only way.” The Half-Breed thus muttered, as the bark of the dog, on the new trail which he had made, attested the success with which he pursued him. Blonay rose upon a stump, and distinctly beheld the head of Humphries, 15* though greatly behind, but still pressing on earnestly, led by the cries of the dog. “I can hit him now—it's not two hundred yards, and I've hit a smaller mark than that so fur, before now.” And, as he spoke, he lifted his rifle, cocked it, and raised it to his eye, where it rested for a few seconds; but Humphries was now covered by a tree. The dog came on, and Blonay distinguished the voices of the pursuers, and that of Humphries in particular, urging the chase with words of encouragement. Unseen himself, he now took a certain aim at the head of the lieutenant; another moment and he must have fired; but, just then, he beheld the figure of Davis pressing through the brush, at a point higher up than the rest, and seemingly bent on making a circuit, which would enable him to get between their present position and the fugitive's only outlet. To merely kill his victim, and to run the risk of perishing himself, was not the desire of the Half-Breed. His Indian blood took its vengeance on safer terms. He slowly uncocked the rifle, let it fall from his shoulder, and once more set off in flight, taking now a course parallel with that which he beheld John Davis pursuing. His object was to reach the same point; and he could only do so, in good time to escape, by keeping the direct route upon which he now found himself. At this moment his dog came up with him. He was about to plunge into a puddle of mixed mire and water. The faithful animal, unconscious of the danger in which he had involved his master, now leaped fondly upon him, testifying his joy at finding him by wantonly yelping at the highest pitch of his voice, and assailing him with the most uncouth caresses, which added to his annoyance by impeding his flight. His clamours also guided the pursuers upon the true path of the fugitive, and would continue to guide them. The moment was full of peril, and every thing depended upon his decision. The savage and ready mood of the Half-Breed did not long delay in a moment of such necessity. Muttering to himself in few words his chagrin, he grasped the dog firmly by the back of his neck, and, as the skin was tightly drawn upon the throat, with a quick movement of his hand he passed the keen blade of his knife but once over it, and thrust the body from him in the ooze. With a single cry and a brief struggle, the animal lay dead in the path of the pursuers. Hurriedly sending the knife back into its sheath, he resumed the rifle which, while he slew the dog, he had leaned against a cypress; and, seemingly without compunction, he again set forward. His flight was now far less desperate, since his pursuers had no longer the keen faculties of the dog to scent for them the path, and his clamorous yelp to guide them upon it; and, with a more perfect steadiness, Blonay pushed onward until he gained a small, though impenetrable, cane-brake. This he soon rounded, and it now lay between him and his enemies. Taking to the water whenever it came in his way, he left but few traces of his route behind him; and to find those, at intervals, necessarily impeded the pursuers. When at length they reached the pond in which he had slain his dog, and beheld the body of their guide before them, they saw that the pursuit was almost hopeless. “Look here!” exclaimed Humphries to the rest, as they severally came up to the spot. “Look here! the skunk, you see, has been mighty hard pushed, and can't be far off; but there's no great chance of finding him now. It's like hunting after a needle in a haystack. So long as we had the dog there was something to go by, for the beast would find his master through thick and thin. Goggle knew that; and he's done the only thing that could have saved him. He's a scout among a thousand—that same Goggle; and no money, if we had it, ought to be stinted to git him on our side. But he knows the difference between guineas and continentals; and, so long as Proctor pays him well with the one, he'd be a mighty fool, being what he is, to bother himself about the other.” At that moment the shrill sounds of the trumpet came to them from the camp, and put an end to the pursuit, as it commanded their presence for other duties. “There's the trumpet, boys; we must put back. We can't stop to bother any longer with a single man; and so little chance, too, of our catching him. We've got other work. The general, you must know, is gitting ready for a brush with the tories; and we have permission to lick them well to-morrow at Baynton's Meadow. If we do we shall all get rich; for Barsfield, they say, is to meet them there with a grand supply of shoes and blankets, muskets and swords, and a thousand other matters besides, which they've got and we want. We must git back at once; and yet, boys, it goes against me to leave this scoundrel in the swamp.” But there they were compelled to leave him in perfect security. The Half-Breed reached his pony, which he mounted at once and proceeded on his return. He had no reason to be dissatisfied with events. He had tracked his enemy, though his vengeance was still unsatisfied; he had found out the secret pass to the rebel camp, and he estimated highly the value of the discovery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIX. The stirring tones of the trumpet, a long and lively peal, resounded through the swamp. Its summons was never unheeded by the men of Marion. They gathered on all hands, and from every quarter of its comprehensive recesses. From the hummock where they slept, from the lakelet where they fished, from the green where they leaped the frog, hurled the bar, or wrestled in emulous sport, and in all the buoyancy of full life and conscious strength. They were soon thick around the person of the partisan, and nothing for some time could be heard but the busy hum, the mingling voices of the crowd, in all the confusion of that sort of preparation and bustle which usually precedes the long march and anticipated conflict. But the quick, sharp, yet low tones of the “swamp fox” soon reduced to silence the commotion, and brought to symmetry and order all that was confusion before. His words were powerful, as they were uttered in a voice of unquestionable command, and with that unhesitating decision which, as it commands respect from the foe, is always sure to secure confidence in the follower. Strange, that in domestic life, and in moments of irresponsible and unexciting calm, usually distinguished by a halting and ungraceful hesitation of manner, which materially took from the dignity of his deportment, it was far otherwise when he came to command and in the hour of collision. He possessed a wonderful elasticity of character, which was never so apparent as when in the time of danger. At such periods there was a lively play of expression in his countenance, denoting a cool and fearless spirit. His manner now was marked by this elasticity; and, instead of anticipated battle, one might have imagined that he was about to promise to his men the relaxation and the delights of a festival. But the sagacious among them knew better. They had seen him drinking vinegar and water—his favourite beverage—in greater quantities than usual; and they knew, from old experience, that a rapid march and a fierce struggle were at hand. “Well, gentlemen,” said Marion, seeing his officers and favourite men all around him, “if you are as tired of the swamp as I am, you will rejoice at the news I bring you. We are now to leave it.” H 3 “Whither now, general?” asked Horry. “Ah, that indeed is the question. We must leave it first. That, gentlemen, is the requisition of our old friend, Captain Barsfield, of his majesty's loyalists, who is now mustering in force around us. He has instructions to set dog upon dog, and hunt us out with our hounds of neighbours—the tories. It is for you to say whether we shall stand and wait their coming, or give them the trouble of hunting the empty swamp after us. I am for leaving them the ground, and looking out for other quarters and a better business.” Cries of “No—no—let us meet them—let us not fly from any tory,” were heard on all hands; and Horry, Singleton, and sundry others of the most favoured officers, seriously interposed with suggestions of their strength, and the ability and willingness of the men to fight. The partisan smiled pleasantly as he listened to their suggestions. “You mistake me somewhat, gentlemen,” was his quiet and general reply; “you mistake me much; and I rejoice that you do so, as I am now so much the better satisfied that your views and feelings accord with my own. To leave the swamp does not mean to fly from the enemy. Oh, no. I propose, on the contrary, that we should leave the swamp in order to seek the enemy before he shall be altogether ready for us. Why should we wait until he has brought his men together?—why wait until the tories from Waccamaw come in to swell the number of our own rascals from Williamsburg?—and why, of all things, wait until Captain Barsfield brings his baggage-wagons with supplies to glut these greedy wretches who expect them? I see no reason for this.” “No—no, general,” was the response; “we are ready for them—we need not wait.” “Very well, gentlemen, as you say—we need not wait; and, supposing that such would be your determination, I have already completed my arrangements for departure. We shall move off with midnight, and it is expected, gentlemen, that you so speed in your duties as to suffer no delay after that period in your departure. Colonel Horry will have his squad in readiness to move with me upon Baynton's Meadow, where we must take post before the tories. The route and general orders he will find in this paper. Singleton—” The chief led the young officer aside. “Singleton, I have special work for you, which calls for all your activity. Take your whole corps of riflemen, and select your horses. Leave to Captain Melton all those of your men who are most cumbrous or may least be relied upon. The duty is too important to be intrusted to clumsy fingers.” Singleton bowed, and Marion continued:— “Proceed up the river road to Brook's Mills, and secure the detachment which Watson had placed there. Let none of them escape, if you can, to carry news across the river. Let your return be by daylight, and then take the road towards Berkeley's place, where Barsfield has found lodgings. He will move to-morrow, with the sun, on the route to Baynton's Meadow. He must be met and beaten at all hazards. I will despatch Captain Melton with thirty men for this purpose; and, in order to make certain, as soon as you have surprised the guard at Brooks', you will push down towards Berkeley's, Kaddipah, or in whatever quarter Barsfield may go. Melton probably will do the business; but, as it will be in your subsequent route, you may as well prepare to co-operate with him, should you be in season. We must keep Barsfield from joining these tories, upon whom I shall most probably fall by mid-day. This you will find a difficult matter, as Barsfield fights well, and is something of a soldier. You must surprise him if you can. This done, you will proceed to scour the upper road, with as much rapidity as comports with caution. The scouts bring me word of a corps in that quarter, which can be no other than Tarleton's. This scrawl too comes from that dear old granny, Mother Dyson, who lives near Monk's Corner. Hear what the good old creature says— “`Dare Gin'ral—There's a power of red-coats jist guine down by the back lane into your parts, and they do tell that it's arter you they're guine. They're dressed mighty fine, and has a heap of guns and horses, and as much provisions as the wagons can tote. I makes bold to tell you this, gin'ral, that you may smite them, hip and thigh, even as the Israelites smote the bloody Philistians in the blessed book. And so, no more, dare gin'ral, from your sarvant to command, Betsy Dyson. “`N. B.—Don't you pay the barer, gin'ral, for he's owing me a power of money, and he's agreed with me that what I gives him for guine down to you is to come out of what he owes me. He's a good man enough, and is no tory, but he ain't quite given to speaking the truth always; and I'm sorry to tell you, gin'ral, that, in spite of all I says to him, he don't mend a bit. “`B. D. “Quite a characteristic epistle, Singleton, and from as true a patriot as ever lived—that same old Betsy Dyson. These troops must be Tarleton's, and I doubt not that he moves with the entire legion. He has pledged himself to Cornwallis to force me to a fight, and he comes to redeem his pledge. This we must avoid, and we must therefore hurry to put these tories out of the way before they can co-operate with the legion. I will see to them. When you have done with Barsfield, should Melton not have struck before you reach him, you will take the upper track until you find Tarleton. But you are to risk nothing—we cannot hope to fight him with our whole force, and you must risk nothing with your little squad. You must only hang about him, secure intelligence of all his movements, and, where opportunities occur, obstruct his steps, and cut off such of his detachments as come in your reach. You can worry the advance, and throw them back upon the foot, for their horses will not hold a leg with the meanest of your troop. We want time, and this will give it us —and none of these risks should be taken unless you encounter the legion before sunset to-morrow. After that, you are simply to watch and report their movements. Should I succeed in the attack at Baynton's to-morrow, you will find me at the ferry at midnight. Should you not, take it as proof of my failure, and look for me at Snow's Island.” A few other minor suggestions completed Singleton's commission, and Marion proceeded in like manner to detail to every officer, intrusted with command, the duties which were before him. With Colonel Horry's squad, he took to himself the task of routing the tories at Baynton's Meadow. Twenty men, under Captain James, he despatched to waylay the road leading from Waccamaw, over which another small body of tories was expected to pass; and this done, the rest of the day was devoted by all parties to preparations for the movement of the night. Promptness was one of the first principles in Marion's warfare. With the approach of evening, the several corps prepared for their departure. Saddles were taken from the trees, on whose branches they had hung suspended all around the camp—steeds were brought forward from the little recesses where they browsed upon the luxuriant cane-tops—swords waved in the declining sunset, bugles sounded from each selected station, where it had been the habit for the several squads to congregate, and, as the sun went redly down behind the thick forest, the camp was soon clear of all the active life which it possessed before. All who were able were away on their several duties; and but a few, the invalids and supernumeraries alone, remained to take charge of themselves and the furniture of the encampment. Meanwhile, leaving the camp of the partisans, let us 16 return to Blonay. Relieved from the hot pursuit which had been urged after him, he relaxed in the rapidity of his movements, and made his way with more composure out of the swamp. He had not slain his enemy, it is true; but he had been quite as successful in discovering the place of his retreat as his most sanguine hopes had predicted. He had not merely seen his particular foe, and found out his hiding-place, but he had discovered the passage to one of those secret haunts of the “swamp fox,” the knowledge of which, he doubted not, would bring him a handsome reward from the British officers, to whom Marion was becoming, daily, more and more an object of hostile consideration. Satisfied, therefore, with the result of his expedition, though lamenting the unavoidable sacrifice which he had made of his dog—his last friend, his only companion—he at once took his way back to “Piney Grove,” where he hoped to meet with Barsfield. It was not long before he stood before the tory, who led him away at once into the woods, anxious, from his intense hate to Mellichampe, to learn how far the Half-Breed had been successful in his search. “Well, what have you done?—what have you seen? Have you found the trail, Blonay? Have you discovered the hiding-place of this reptile—these reptiles?” “Well, cappin, there's no saying for certain, when you're upon the trail of a good woodman. He's everywhere, and then agin he's nowhere. Sometimes he's in one place, sometimes in another; and sometimes it ain't three minutes difference that he don't have a change. Now the `swamp fox' is famous for drawing stakes, and going there's no telling where.” “True, true, I know all that. But it's for a good scout to find him out, and track him through all his changes. Now, what have you done in your search? You have seen your enemy, have you not? Where have you left him?—and, above all, have you seen the boy— he whom, of all others, I would have you see? What of Mellichampe?” “I seed him, cappin, but mighty far off—I know'd him from what you tell'd me—I can't be mistaken.” “Well!” “But, cappin, there's a mighty heap of men with Marion—more than a hundred.” “Impossible! you dream!” responded the tory, in astonishment. “It's a gospel truth, sir, and they looked quite sprigh; and the trumpet blowed, and there was a great gathering. They had a fine chance of horses, too—some of the finest I ever laid eyes on.” “Ha, indeed! This will be work for Tarleton, who must now be at hand. From Monk's Corner to Smoot's, thirty miles—then here—he should be here to-morrow noon, and I must hurry with the dawn for Baynton's— yes—it must be at daylight.” The tory thus muttered to himself, and the Half-Breed duly treasured up every syllable. The speaker proceeded again, addressing his companion— “'Tis well—you have managed handsomely, Blonay; but you have not yet said where the gathering took place. Tell me the route you took, and give me a full description of the spot itself, and all particulars of your adventure.” But the Half-Breed, though exhorted thus, was in no haste to yield any particulars to Barsfield. The casual reference to Tarleton's approach, which had fallen from the tory's lips in his brief soliloquy, had determined Blonay to keep his secret for one who would most probably pay him better; and, though he replied to, he certainly did not answer, the question of his present employer. “Well, now, cappin, there's no telling how to find the place I went to. There's so many crooks and turns— so many ins and outs—so many ups and downs, that it's all useless to talk about it. It's only nose and eye that can track it out for you; for, besides that I don't know the names of any places in these parts, I could only find it myself by putting my foot along the track, and taking hold of the bushes which I broke myself. I could tell you that you must take the road back to the left, then strike across the old field to the right, then you come to a little bay, and you go round that till you fall into a little path, that leads you into the thick wood; then you keep a little to the left agin, and you go on in this way a full quarter before you come out into a valley; then—” “Enough, enough—such a direction would baffle the best scout along the Santee. We must even trust to your own eyes and feet when the time comes to hunt these reptiles, and I trust that your memory will not fail you then.” “Never fear, cappin,” responded the other, agreeably satisfied to be let off so easily from a more precise description of the route which he had taken. It is probable that, with a greater force than that which he commanded, and which was entirely inadequate to any such enterprise, Barsfield, solicitous of distinction, and seeking after his foe, would have compelled the guidance of Blonay, and gone himself after the “swamp fox.” As matters stood, however, he determined to pursue his old bent, and seeking his tories at Baynton's Meadow, leave to the fierce Tarleton the honour of hunting out the wily Marion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XX. Barsfield retired to his slumbers that night with pleasant anticipations. Blonay again sought the woods, and sleeplessly sought, by the doubtful moonlight, his way into the same swamp recesses which he had traversed through the day. His leading passion was revenge, and he spared no pains to secure it. He could sleep standing against a tree; and he seemed not even to need repose at all. He was gone all night, yet appeared at the mansion of Mr. Berkeley ready for his breakfast, and seemingly as if he had never felt fatigue. The two maidens the next morning stood conversing in the piazza. Barsfield, with his corps, baggage-wagons and all, had just departed. Blonay, too, had set off, but in a different direction. Piney Grove was once more left to its old, sweet quiet; and a painful restraint and a heavy weight seemed taken from the heart of Janet Berkeley with the absence of her father's guests. “Well, Janet,” exclaimed the livelier Rose Duncan, as they looked down the long avenue, and surveyed its quiet, “I am heartily glad our military visiters are gone. I am sick of big swords, big whiskers, and big feathers, the more particularly indeed, as, with many of this sort of gentry, these endowments seem amply sufficient to atone for, and redeem, the most outrageous stupidity, mixed with much more monstrous self-esteem. There was not one of these creatures, now, that could fairly persuade a body, even in the most trying country emergency, to remember she had a heart at all. All was stuff and stiffness, buttons and buckram; and when the creatures did make a move, it was a sort of wire and screw exhibition—a dreadful operation in mechanics, as 16* if a clumsy inventor, armed with thumbs rather than fingers, and mortally apprehensive that his work would go to pieces before he could get it safely out of his hands, had wheeled it out, and was wheeling it in, soured and sullen, from a consciousness that, in so wheeling it, the rickety thing had not shown to advantage. And these are soldiers?—Well, Heaven save us, I pray, as much from their love as from their anger. The latter might bayonet one, it is true; but I should as surely die of the annoyance and ennui that would inevitably come with the other. Look up, my dear cousin, and tell me what you think.” It was thus that the lively Rose Duncan discoursed of the tory troop to her cousin. Janet replied quietly— a pleasant but subdued smile touching her lips, softly and sweet, as a faint blush of sunlight resting upon some drooping flower by the wayside. “And yet, my dear Rose, you have no reason to complain: you certainly made a conquest of the young lieutenant, Mr. Clayton; his eyes spoke eloquently enough; and his mouth, whenever it was opened, was full of the prettiest compliments. You must not be ungrateful.” “Nor am I. I do not complain of, nor yet will I appropriate, the `goods the gods provide me.' I take leave to congratulate myself on their leaves-taking—all—not to omit my simpering, sweet, slender Adonis, the gentle lieutenant himself. Pshaw, Janet, how can you suppose that I should endure such a sillabub sort of creature? You must have pitied me, hearing, with no hope of escape, his rhapsodies about music and poetry— moonlight and bandana handkerchiefs; for he mixed matters up in such inextricable confusion, that I could have laughed in his face but that it required some effort to overcome the stupid languor with which he possessed me. You needn't smile, Janet—he did,—he was a most delicate bore.” “And you really desire me to believe, Rose, that he has made no interest in your heart?” was the response of Janet to all this tirade. The graver maiden of the two seemed disposed to adopt some of the light humour of her companion, and annoy her after her own fashion, “Interest!—heart!—how can you talk such stuff, Janet, and look so serious all the while? You should be pelted with pine-burs, and I will undertake your punishment before the day is well over. By-the-way, talking of pine-burs, I am reminded, though I don't see why, of the strange blear-eyed countryman. What a curious creature, with that stiff, straight black hair—so glossy black,—and those eyes that seem popping from his head, and look of all colours,—and then the rigid, yet loose fixture of his limbs, that seem like those of a statue, drawn asunder, and left hanging by the merest ligatures. What a queer creature!” “He seems poor and humble,” replied Janet, “and is probably affected mentally. He seems idiotic.” “Not he—not he! His gaze is too concentrative and too fixed to indicate a wandering intellect: then, why his frequent conversations with that bull-necked lover of yours, Barsfield? Did he not take him into the woods when the countryman came back yesterday evening, and keep him there a full hour? I tell you what, Janet, that fellow's a spy: he's after no good here; and, as I live, here he is, coming back full tilt upon his crooked pony, that's just as queer and ugly as himself.” As she said, Blonay reappeared at this moment, and the dialogue ceased accordingly between the maidens. The Half-Breed grinned with an effort at pleasantness as he bowed to them, and, speaking a few words to Mr. Berkeley, as if in explanation of his return, he proceeded to loiter about the grounds. The eyes of Rose watched him narrowly, and with no favourable import; but Blonay did not seem to heed her observation. He now sauntered in the park, and now he leaned against a tree in the pleasant sunshine; and, by his torpid habit of body, seemed to justify Janet to her more lively cousin in the opinion which she had uttered of his idiocy. But the scout was never more actively employed than just when he seemed most sluggish. He was planning the sale of Marion's camp to Tarleton. He was loitering about Piney Grove with the double object of being nigh his enemy's hiding-place and of meeting with the legionary. “He is a spy, Janet. He has been put here as a watch over us and upon Mellichampe. Barsfield knows Mellichampe to be rash, as he has shown himself, and he has put that fellow here to look out for and shoot him.” Janet shuddered, and her eyes involuntarily turned to the spot where, at a little distance, the Half-Breed stood leaning against a tree. How imploring was the expression of her eye! Could he have seen it, if such were his purpose, he must have relented. Such was the thought of Rose—such the hope of Janet. The scout had seen that look—he had felt its expression. “But where is he now, Janet?” was the question of Rose a few moments after. He was gone, and so stealthily they had not suspected his movement. The Half-Breed was again upon the track of his enemy. Barsfield, meanwhile, though dispensing with the attendance of Blonay, did not fail to avail himself, in one respect, of the information which the latter had given him. The proximity of Marion in the swamp, with a hundred men or more, aroused the tory to increased exertion, and counselled the utmost prudence in his march, as it showed the neighbourhood of so superior an enemy. The arms, baggage, clothing, and ammunition, intended to supply a large body of tories, and which were intrusted to his charge, were of far more importance to his present purposes than of real intrinsic value. Not to deliver them safely into the hands of those who were to employ them, and whom he was to employ, would be to suffer dreadfully in the estimation of his British superiors, and in his own personal interests. To have them fall into the hands of the rebels, were to accumulate evil upon evil, as no acquisition which the latter could make at this period could be of greater importance. It was well for him that these suggestions filled the mind of the tory. He was a tolerable soldier on a small scale, and was already well conversant with the partisan warfare. He sent forward a few trusty horsemen to reconnoitre and keep the advance; and, moving cautiously and with watchful eyes, he hoped to make his way without interruption. But he was not fated to do so, as we shall see anon. Major Singleton, having a more extended line of country to traverse, and a greater variety of duties to perform, started from the swamp at dusk, and some time before the rest. Marion set forth by midnight; and Captain Melton, after attending to some matters of minor importance, led off his little corps an hour later. Our attention will chiefly be given to this latter band, of which Ernest Mellichampe was the first-lieutenant, and Jack Witherspoon the orderly. By the dawn they found themselves at one of the lower crossing-places upon the river, probably that at which it would be the aim of Barsfield to cross; but, as this was uncertain, it was not the policy of Melton to await him there. The position was by no means good, and the ground too much broken for the free use of cavalry. With the dawn, therefore, Melton moved his troop slowly up the road, intending to place them in ambush behind a thick wood which lay in their route, and which had been already designated for this purpose. The road ran circuitously through this wood, forming a defile, around which a proper disposition of his force must have been successful, and must have resulted in the destruction or capture of the entire force of the tories. The spot was well known to the partisans, and had been determined upon, even before the party left the river, as well adapted, beyond any other along the road, for the contemplated encounter. It lay but seven miles off, and one hour's quick riding would have enabled them to reach and secure it. But Melton pursued a regular, or rather a cautious gait, which, under other circumstances and at another time, would have been proper enough. But now, when the object was the attainment of a particular station, a forced movement became essential, in most part, to their success; certainly to that plan of surprise which they had in view. Mellichampe more than once suggested this to his superior officer; but the latter was one of those persons who have solemn and inveterate habits, from which they never depart. His horse had but one gait, and to that he was accustomed. His rider had but a single tune, and that was a dead march. The consequence of these peculiarities was a funeral movement on the present occasion, and no argument of Mellichampe could induce Melton to urge the advance more briskly. He cursed the monotonous drone in his heart; and, biting his lips until the blood started from them, he predicted to himself that the party would be too late. And so indeed it happened. Barsfield, whom the intelligence brought by Blonay had prompted to renewed speed in his movements, had set forth, as we have seen, by the dawn of day, and was upon the road quite as soon as Melton, who had been travelling half the night. Had the counsel of Mellichampe been taken, the desired position would have been gained easily by the partisans; for, as it lay a little nearer to “Piney Grove” than to the swamps, and as Barsfield, though urging his course forward with all due rapidity, was unavoidably compelled to move slowly, burdened as he was with his baggage-wagons, nothing could have been more easy than to have attained it with a proper effort. But Melton was not the man to make an effort—he had no mind for an occasion; and the force of habit, with him, was far more controlling than any impulse from necessity. Such a man is no genius. He stopped his troop here and there, to scour this or that suspicious-looking growth of underwood—sent out his scouts of observation, as if he had been engaged in the vague and various duties of the forager, instead of pushing forward with the single object—the performance of the task which he had in hand. The consequence of this blundering was foreseen, and partially foretold, by the indignant Mellichampe, who could scarcely restrain his anger within terms of courtesy. Bitterly aroused, he was ready almost for revolt; and, but for the presence of the danger, and the necessity of turning his wrath in the more legitimate direction of his enemies, it was apparent to all that, from the harsh tones and stern looks interchanged by the two officers, an outbreak must soon have followed. But the thoughts of all were turned to other objects, as, suddenly, one of their troopers rode up, informing Melton of the approach of Barsfield close at hand. He had only time to marshal his men on the side of a little copse and bay that lay between himself and the foe, when the heavy tramp of the cavalry and the creaking wheels of the baggage-wagons were heard at a little distance. A timely resolution, even then, though comparatively unprepared, might yet have retrieved the error which the commander of the troop had committed; but his looks were now indecisive, his movements uncertain, and he gave his orders for a change of position, imagining that a better stand presented itself a little distance back. “This must not be, Captain Melton!” cried Mellichampe, indignantly. “It is quite too late, sir, to think of any such change. A retrograde movement, full in the face of an advancing enemy, will have the effect of a retreat upon our troop, and give the enemy all the advantage of our panic and confusion, together with the courage and confidence which our seeming flight must inspire in them. We cannot change now, and we must make the best of our position. Had my advice been minded—” He was interrupted as the close sounds of the advancing tories met his ears. Melton saw the impossibility of any change now, and the discovery on his part produced in his mind all the feelings of surprise and discomfiture which he had planned for the reception of his foe. He gave his orders, it is true; but he did not look the officer to his men, and they did not feel with him. Not so with Mellichampe; the few words which had passed in the hearing of the troop between him and his commander—the air of fierce decision which his features wore—the conscious superiority which they indicated—were all so many powerful spells of valour, which made the brave fellows turn their eyes upon him as upon their true leader. And so he was. The imbecility of Melton became more conspicuous as the moment of trial approached. He halted, hung back, as the enemy entered upon the little defile in which only it could be attacked; and thus exposed his men, when the attack was made, to all the disadvantages arising from a suffered surprise. It was then that the impatient blood of Mellichampe, disdaining all the restraints of discipline, urged him forward in the assault with a fierce shout to his men, and a scornful jeer almost in the ears of his commander, as, driving his good steed before him, he advanced to the charge, which he made with so much force and impetuosity as at once to stagger the progress of the tories. Barsfield was just then emerging from the pass—a little cornfield, with its worm-fence enclosure, lay on one hand, and, on the other, the woods were open and free from undergrowth. It was here that Melton's men had been posted, not so advantageously as they would have been had they reached the spot which Marion had designated for them; but sufficiently well to have rendered the attack successful under a spirited charge such as that made by Mellichampe. But the information which Barsfield had received from Blonay had made him extremely cautious, as we have already seen, and he had properly prepared himself against, and was on the look-out for, assaults like the present. With the first appearance of the enemy, his men were ordered to display themselves in open order; the wagons were suffered to fall behind, and were carried back under the escort of a single dragoon to the spot from which they had started in the morning. To this effect the instructions of Barsfield had been already given. Free and unencumbered, the tory met his enemy boldly, and received him with a discharge of pistols. The steed of Mellichampe was at this moment careering within a few paces of him. The sabre of the youth waving above his head, and, with a bitter smile, rising in his stirrups, he cried out, as he prepared to cross weapons with his enemy— “Dog of a tory, we have a clear field now! There are none to come between us. Strike, villain, and strike well; for, by my father's blood, I will give you no quarter!” Barsfield calmly seemed to await his approach, and exhibited no lack of courage: yet his sabre was unlifted—his bridle lay slackened in his hand; and, but for his erect posture and firm seat, it might be supposed that he was a mere looker-on in the affray. He replied to the furious language of his youthful opponent in tones and language as fierce. “You may swear by your own blood soon, boy, or I much mistake your chances.” The sabre of the youth glared in his face at this reply, and the movement of the tory was made in another instant with all the rapidity of thought. His horse, under the quick impulse of a heavy bit, was brought round in a moment: in another, a huge pistol was drawn Vol. I.—I 17 from his holsters, and the careering steed of Mellichampe received the bullet meant for his master in his own breast. He fell forward upon his knees, made an imperfect effort to rise, and the next moment plunged desperately and struggled almost under the feet of Barsfield's horse. A few seconds sufficed for Mellichampe's extrication; and he was barely in time, by throwing up his sabre, to arrest the stroke of his enemy's. On foot he now pressed forward upon Barsfield, and sought to close so nearly in with him as to make it difficult for him to employ his sabre, unless by shortening it too greatly to permit of his using it with any advantage. But the tory saw his design, and immediately backed his steed. Mellichampe pursued him, with his accustomed rashness, and must certainly have been slain by the tory, who had now drawn another pistol from his holster, when Witherspoon, who had been hotly engaged, but had seen with anxiety the contest between the two enemies, now rushed between; and, setting the huge and splendid horse which he rode directly in the teeth of that of Barsfield, the shock of their meeting threw the latter completely upon his haunches, and nearly unseated his rider. The sabres of Barsfield and Witherspoon then clashed hurriedly, and, though chafed to be robbed of his prey even by his friend, Mellichampe was compelled to forbear his particular game, and turn his attention entirely to his own safety. A horse plunged by him riderless, which he was fortunate enough to seize, and he was mounted opportunely just as a fresh charge of the tories separated Witherspoon from his opponent, whom he had pressed back into the defile, and which drove the sergeant, in his turn, down upon the original position of the attacking party. The charge was for a few moments irresistible, and two or three of the men fairly turned their horses and fled from before it. Captain Melton, seeing this, gave the order to retreat, and the trumpet sounded the quick and mortifying signal. But the voice of the youthful Mellichampe sounded even above the shrill alarum of the instrument, as, with a desperate blow with his sabre, he struck the recreant trumpeter to the earth. “Shame to you, men of Marion!—shame!—do you fly from the tories of Waccamaw? Do you give back before the Winyah clay-eaters? Follow me!” The cry of Witherspoon was yet more characteristic, and, perhaps, far more potential. “You forget, boys, sartainly, that the tories find it natural to be licked; and if they was to lick you now, that's licked them so often, they wouldn't know what to do for joy. Turn to, and let's lick 'em again!” The call was not made in vain. True valour is quite as contagious as fear, since it is always quite as earnest. The partisans heard the words of their leaders,—they saw the headlong rush of their steeds; and they rushed forward also with as generous an emotion. They were received with a front quite as firm, and a spirit not less forward than their own. The tories, too, had been inspirited by their success in the first shock, and, with loud cheers, they prepared for the second. The encounter, as it was made just at the mouth of the defile, a circumscribed position, where each man found his opponent, had something of the character of the mixed fight of the middle ages. The rush was tremendous; the strife, for a few moments, terrible. But all in vain did the eye of Mellichampe distinguish, and his spirit burn once more to contend with his deadly enemy. They were kept asunder by the tide of battle. The ranks were broken; the fight became pell-mell; and, on a sudden, while each man was contending with his enemy, a fierce cry of triumph and of vengeance burst from the lips of Barsfield himself. Mellichampe, though closely engaged with a stout dragoon, suffered his eye to seek the spot whence the sound arose, and at once beheld its occasion. Barsfield had been contending I 2 with a slender, but fine-looking youth, whom he had disarmed. The hand of his conqueror had torn him from his horse with all the strength of a giant. The youth lay at his feet, resting upon one hand, and looking partly upon his foe and partly round, as if imploring succour from his friends. Mellichampe distinguished the features instantly, though smeared with blood. They were those of Gabriel Marion, the nephew of the general, a youth of nineteen only. “He shall not die, by Heaven!” cried Mellichampe aloud; in the same moment, with a daring effort, drawing his horse back from the encounter with the enemy with whom he was engaged, as if in flight,—a movement which, encouraging the other to press forward, disordered his guard, and placed him at disadvantage. Meeting his stroke, Mellichampe set it readily aside; then, striking in turn at the head of his opponent, he put spurs to his horse, without looking to see what had been the effect of his blow, and, passing quickly beyond him, rushed forward to meet with Barsfield. But, as he approached, he saw that nothing could be done for the youth, whose hand was uplifted,—a frail defence—in opposition to his conqueror's weapon. “Stay, Barsfield,—strike him not, scoundrel, or look for the vengeance—” But, ere the speech was finished, the youth leaped once more to his feet, and the weapon meant for his head passed over it. Young Marion then grasped the sword-arm of his enemy; but, drawing his remaining pistol in the same moment, Barsfield shot him through the breast. The cry of grief on the one hand, and of triumph on the other, contributed greatly to discourage the partisans. That moment was fatal to several more in their ranks, and the disparity of force was now in favour of the tories. They were soon conscious of the fact, and pressed upon their enemies. Stung with shame, Mellichampe made a desperate effort, and, nobly seconded by a few, threw himself in the path of the enemy, and bravely disputed every inch of ground, yielding it only under the pressure of numbers. “I cannot fly, Witherspoon,—speak not of it, I tell you. I know that the odds are against us, but we must only strike the oftener.” “Well, Airnest, jist as you say. You know best if you like it; and so, knock away's the word.” Two or three brief sentences between the friends conveyed the difficulties and dangers of the scene and the spirit of the combatants. The partisans fought well, but they grew weaker in numbers and individual strength with every movement of the protracted battle. They had not well calculated the difference of personal capacity for strife and endurance of fatigue between drilled men and volunteers; and, though the spirit of the latter, for a time, is more than a match for the hardening practice of the former, yet it very seldom endures so well. “I will perish on this field—I will not leave it, and show my back to that scoundrel! Come on, men!— come on, Witherspoon!—let us pluck up spirit for another—a last—a desperate charge. I must meet with Barsfield now; there are too few on either side to keep us long apart.” A brief pause in the combat, as if by tacit consent, enabled Mellichampe, in the breathing time which it afforded, to convey this suggestion and resolve to the few fierce spirits still gathering around him—driven back, but not yet defeated—dispirited, perhaps, but far from subdued. They freely pledged themselves to the resolution, and, with a cheer, as if they had been going to a banquet, they drove the rowels into their jaded steeds, and joined once more in the struggle. But the weapons had scarcely crossed, and the close strife had not yet begun, when the shrill notes of a bugle rang through the wood to the left of the combatants. “It is Singleton's trumpet,” cried Mellichampe aloud 17* to his men; and a cheer of encouragement involuntarily went up from their lips as they listened to the grateful music. In the next moment, at full gallop, the re-enforcement of Singleton came plunging forward to the rescue from the woods on every side, while the full-toned voice of their gallant leader shouted to the fainting combatants to strike on without faltering. Barsfield, so lately confident of his triumph over his enemy, and of his vengeance upon the one foe in particular about to be realized, was compelled to forego the prey almost within his grasp. “Now may the hell have him that fights for him!” cried the disappointed tory, as, with the first appearance of Singleton's troop, he ordered his own bugles to sound the retreat. Clearing, with terrible blows, the few enemies that were yet clinging around him, Barsfield wheeled furiously in his flight, while close at his heels, pursuing to the very gates of Piney Grove, but not fast enough to overtake him, Singleton urged forward his wearied animals, in the fond hope of annihilating a foe so insolent, and who promised to become so troublesome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXI. Barsfield had neither ridden so far, nor in such haste, as the partisans that morning. This alone saved him. His horses were inferior; and, but for the fatigue which his enemies had undergone, he must have been overtaken. The judicious disposition which the tory had made of his baggage-wagons, in sending them back to Piney Grove at the first appearance of danger, also contributed greatly to the facility of his movements; and, unimpeded by the necessity of guarding them, and not much breathed by the stirring encounter through which they had passed, the stout horses which his men bestrode, though not so swift as those of the Americans, were yet better able to make headway in the flight. The pursuit was hotly urged, though unsuccessful. The horses of Singleton were too much jaded with the hard ride of twenty odd miles which they had taken, and could not be made to keep up even with the fagged animals of Mellichampe's little troop. Barsfield escaped them, and safely passed through the avenue of Piney Grove before the pursuing party came in sight. The baggage-wagons of the tory had just arrived, and, with a sagacious disposition of his force, which indicated abilities worthy of a better cause, he proceeded to make effective arrangements for the reception of Singleton's troop, which was quite too large to suffer him to think that so enterprising a partisan would draw them off without a farther attempt upon him. Dismounting his men rapidly, therefore, he threw open the doors of the basement story of the mansion; and, without leave asked or given—the exigency was too pressing for mere courtesies—he made his dragoons stable their steeds in the spacious apartments. Emptying the baggage-wagons of their contents, he armed his men with the muskets, of which there was sufficient provision; and, having secured the residue of their stores within the walls of the dwelling-house, he proceeded, to the great disquiet of Mr. Berkeley and the terror of the young ladies, to close the doors and make a fortress of the family mansion. The upper rooms were barricaded with chairs and tables; and, watchful at all the windows, the troopers stood ready with their muskets, peering forth conspicuously and warningly in all directions from the building. This was scarcely done when the partisans came down the avenue. It was with no little vexation that Singleton surveyed this prospect. His eye at a moment beheld the difficulties of his situation, and the danger of any assault upon a foe so well prepared. To rush on brick walls, and be met by musket-bullets, without being able to obtain sight of the defenders, was not the part of a discreet valour; and yet, to leave an enemy so enfeebled as Barsfield was without farther efforts to overcome or destroy him, was still more irksome to a brave spirit like that of the officer in command. The rash and headlong Mellichampe, however, thinking only of his personal hostility to Barsfield, could hardly be restrained. He was for immediately charging and trying the weight of an axe upon the doors of the dwelling. “Ay, ay; but how to get there?” cried the more sagacious Singleton. “No, no, Mellichampe, we must try some better plan—some safer enterprise. To cross the yard in the teeth of those muskets would be certain death to nearly every man who makes the effort, and we are but too poorly provided with soldiers to be thus profligate. We must think of something else; and, in order to have time for it, let us send a message to the tory. Let us see what fair words will do, and the promise of good quarter. Besides, we must make some arrangements for getting the family out of the house before making any assault.” The truth of these suggestions was unquestionable; and Mellichampe volunteered to bear the despatches, but Singleton refused him. “No, no; the risk will be great to you; and the tory hates you too well to stop at trifles. He might be tempted to some desperate act if you are to be the messenger. I prefer Witherspoon.” “Jist as you say, major; I'm ready, as the alligator said to the duck. I'm ready; though I ain't a great speaker, yet I can tell Barsfield what he's to reckon on if he don't come to tarms. If so be all I've got to say is to tell him he'll be licked if he don't give up and surrender, I can do that easy enough,” was the prompt speech of the scout. “You know there's danger, Witherspoon,” said Singleton. “This fellow Barsfield may not think it becoming to treat with a rebel; and he may send a bullet through the head of a courier and think no sin of it.” “Well, he'd be a mean skunk to do sich a thing, major; that's agin all the civilities of war. I knows there's a danger, but I can't help it. `Man that is born of woman,' says the scripture—I don't rightly call to mind the other part—but it means that we've all got to die some time or other, and 'taint the part of a brave man to be always dodging from danger. I must take my chance, major, so git your paper ready.” Singleton pencilled brief but honourable proposals to the tory, pledging the enlargement of himself and party on parole if they would surrender; and denouncing otherwise the well-known horrors of a storm. A permission, in the event of his refusal to surrender, was extended to Mr. Berkeley and his family, but no other person, to leave the beleaguered dwelling. Witherspoon received the paper, and prepared to depart. “Mayn't I carry my rifle, major?—I don't feel altogether natural when I don't have it, partic'larly when I'm to go seek my enemy.” “No arms, Witherspoon; nothing but the flag.” He handed the weapon to Mellichampe with no small reluctance. “Take care of her, Airnest; she's a sweet critter, and makes a crack that's born music, and I loves her.” With no more words, and with a single glance towards the youth, that spoke volumes of affection warmly and truly felt, the scout, without any hesitation, turned away from the park where this conference was carried on; and, waving his handkerchief aloft—the substitute for a flag—he proceeded on his way of peril to the dwelling. “I see a rebel with a flag!” said one of the tories who first discerned the despatch to his commander. “Shall I shoot him, sir?” I 3 The hesitation of Barsfield to reply was almost a permission, and the man had his gun lifted and ready; but the tory captain thought it more proper or more prudent to forbear. “No; let him come: and you, Clayton, receive him at the entrance. But see that no other approaches. Fire at the first man who appears within reach of your muskets.” In an inner room, in the presence of the family, Barsfield received the messenger. His reply to the message was one of scornful disdain. “Well, now, cappin,” said Thumbscrew, coolly, “you'd better not send any sich word to the major, for he's old hell with his grinders, and it'll be pretty bad for you if he once gits them into your flesh. They'll meet now, I tell you, if he does.” “You are answered,” was the temperate reply of the tory, who then turned to Mr. Berkeley. “The rebel graciously accords you permission, with your family, to leave the dwelling, Mr. Berkeley. You are at perfect liberty to do so, if you please; but, if you will rely on my defences, there is no danger: the place is perfectly tenable.” “No, no, dear father,—let us go—let us fly. There is danger; and, even if there be none, it is no place for us.” “But where shall we go, my daughter?” said the old man, utterly bewildered. “To the overseer's house, father. It is out of the reach of all danger, and there is room enough for us all.” They came forth with Witherspoon, who led them at once into the park, where Mellichampe received and escorted them to the dwelling-house of the overseer, a rude but spacious building, that stood in a field running along at a little distance to the west of the avenue, within sight and hearing of the mansion-house, but beyond reach of fire-arms from that quarter. It was a moment of sweet sorrow, that which Mellichampe and Janet enjoyed in the brief interview which the necessities of the time permitted them. The cheerful and stimulating sounds of the trumpet recalled him to his duties, and, with a word of encouragement and hope, which was answered by her tears, he hurried away to the field of strife, and the presence of the energetic Singleton. “Lieutenant Mellichampe, take your men, throw down yonder panels, and cross into the garden; keep them under cover where the shelter is sufficient to conceal your movement, and have your horses then fastened at the foot of the hill rising on the right. A couple of sentries will guard them there. This done, return to the post assigned you in the garden, covering the dwelling on the rear with your rifles.” Mellichampe moved promptly, in obedience to his orders, and soon succeeded in securing possession of the garden. Dividing his command in such a manner as to place a similar body of men in watch over each quarter of the building, Singleton proceeded to try the effect of his rifles upon such of the defenders as were more than necessarily exposed. His men were dismounted for this purpose, their horses secured in safety, and each man was put in possession of his tree. To the rifles of Singleton the muskets of Barsfield's party readily responded, and for a few moments the din and uproar were continued with no little spirit. The musketry soon ceased, however. Barsfield discovered that it was not his policy to risk his men, two of whom had fallen in this overture, in any such unequal conflict. The certainty of the rifle, in such hands as those of the partisans, was too great a danger to be wantonly opposed by musket-men. There was no necessity for any such exposure on the part of the besieged: all that they were required to do was to keep watch upon the area below, and prevent the nearer approach of the beleaguering party. After a few rounds, therefore, had shown what results must follow such a combat, Barsfield forbade the firing from the house, and commanded that his men should lie close, only watching for an occasional exposure of the persons of their enemies within certain reach of their muskets. The bugle of Singleton called up his officers. They assembled, as at a central and safe point, at the overseer's dwelling, to which the family of Mr. Berkeley had retired. A small room was assigned the partisans, and there they carried on their hurried deliberations. “This is child's play, gentlemen,” said Singleton; “can we find no better mode of dislodging these rascals? Our shot do little good now. There is no object to aim at. Barsfield has discovered the difference between rifled and smooth bore, and keeps too snug to suffer any harm at our hands. We must think of something, gentlemen; and it must be done quickly, or not at all, for Tarleton's on the road, and we must beat Barsfield by noon, or leave him. What do you say? I should be pleased, gentlemen, to have your suggestions.” “Many men, many minds.” It would be needless to say, that there must be various counsels when there are many counsellors. Each had his notion and his plan, but to all there were objections. Humphries, at length, proposed to fire the dwelling. All agreed that this was the wisest suggestion—the effective plan, if it could only be made available. But who was to carry the fire to the fortress,—who was to cross the yard, in the teeth of thirty muskets, and “bell the cat?”—and what would be the chances of his life, or of his success, in the endeavour? This was the question, to which there was no ready answer. It was obvious enough that any one approaching the building with such a purpose, or with any purpose, as an enemy, must be shot down by its defenders. A silence of several minutes followed the utterance of these views by Singleton. The silence was broken by one—a slender, pale, and trembling youth, who emerged from behind the commander. His lips quivered as he spoke, but it was not with fear. His eye kindled with light, even while its long dark lashes seemed suffused with the dews of a tender heart. “I will go, major,” were his quickly-uttered words. “You, Lance?—why, boy, you will be shot down instantly. Impossible!—you must not think of it!” was the imperative reply. “But, sir, I can run fast: I can first get to the fallen tree, and so quickly, I don't think they can hit me in that time; and then the next push is for the piazza. Once I get under the piazza, I will be safe:” and the lad trembled with his own earnestness. “Perhaps you might, Lance, but it would be impossible to preserve your fire in such a race, and the risk is too great to be undertaken with such a prospect.” Singleton was imperative, but the youth continued to urge his plan. At that moment a servant, entering the apartment, beckoned Mellichampe away. He was sent for by Janet, who received him in the adjoining room. “I have heard,” said she, “some of your deliberations without intending it: but your voices are loud, and these are thin partitions. The youth must not be suffered to go to certain death. I understand your difficulty, and think it may be overcome. I have a plan for you.” “You!” exclaimed Mellichampe, with a smile. “Yes: look at this bow and these arrows,” pointing to a noble shaft, which leaned in the corner of the room; “they were the gift of a Catawba warrior to my father when I was but a child. They are as good as new. They will convey combustibles to the roof,— they will do what you desire.” “But your old home—your family dwelling, Janet,— 18 sacred to you as your birthplace, and as the birthplace of your mother—” was the suggestion of her lover. “Sacred as my home, as my own and my mother's birthplace, it is yet doubly sacred as my country's. Place your combustibles upon these arrows, and send them to the aged roof of that family mansion; and I shall not joy the less to see it burn because it is my father's, and should be mine, when I know that in its ruin the people and the cause I love must triumph. God forbid and keep me from the mean thought that I shall lose by that which to my country must be so great a gain.” The wondering and delighted Mellichampe could only look his admiration. She stood before him, with her dark eye flashing, but suffused, and her lip trembling with the awful patriotism and warm feeling in her soul, as the very imbodiment of liberty itself,—that divine imbodiment whose substance is truth, whose light is life, whose aim is a perfect humanity. “Dearest Janet,—worthy of adoration as of love,— your self-sacrificing spirit is a rebuke to my own heart. I would have saved that mansion for your sake, though even my enemy—my deadly enemy—should escape his just punishment thereby.” “Go, Ernest,” she responded, “go!—you have no time to lose. Let not that noble youth expose himself to certain death. Take the arrows, and do not let the hand tremble and the eye turn aside when you direct them to that sacred roof; it is now devoted to our country.” He seized the bow and arrows, carried her hand to his lips, and rushed back to the place of conference. Singleton was overjoyed when the primitive weapon was put into his hands. “Happy chance!—and who has given you these, Mellichampe?” “A woman!” “What, Miss Berkeley?” “Yes.” “And with a knowledge of their probable use?” “With the avowed purpose of destroying by them her father's dwelling and her own.” “Noble creature!” was the only exclamation of Singleton. The thoughts of his mind wandered away, at that instant, without his power to control them; and, in his mind's eye, he surveyed the form of another self-sacrificing maiden,—how different from Janet Berkeley in form and character, but, oh! very like in soul.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXII. With the overruling judgment of a master spirit, Singleton immediately proceeded to make his arrangements. To Mellichampe he gave orders to remount his men; and, leading them around the park, once more gain possession of the avenue. Here he was to await the result of the experiment, and to intercept the flight of the tories when they should be driven out from their fortress by the progress of the flames. Humphries was commanded to scatter his riflemen around the mansion, keeping close watch upon every movement of the garrison within: while two or three of the men, more experienced in such matters, were occupied in preparing the combustibles which were to be fastened to the lighted arrows. Singleton himself took charge of the bow; and, laying aside his sword and every weapon which was calculated to encumber his movement, himself prepared to discharge the more arduous part of the proposed experiment. His commands were nearly all instantly and simultaneously executed. A lively blast of the bugle, from various quarters of the grounds, gave token of concerted preparation. Arming himself with the prepared arrows, the partisan advanced. “Lie close, men! lie close!” he cried, as he saw several of them emerging from shelter; “Lie close and watch the windows. Go back, Lance, and have your rifle in readiness.” With these words he advanced quickly but stealthily, and with a heedful movement, from one tree to another, until, reaching the inner limit of the park, he looked down upon the yard immediately around the dwelling, and saw that from that part he could certainly send his arrows to the roof. Coolly preparing himself, therefore, while all behind him were breathlessly watching, now their commander and now the dwelling, Singleton fell back for an instant, and closely observed the probable distance and height of the roof; then advancing to the tree, and planting his right foot firmly behind him, he drew the long arrow to the head, until the missiles which were attached to it grazed against the bended back of the elastic yew. In another instant, and the meteor-like shaft went whizzing and kindling through the air, darting on with a true aim and unvarying flight, until, to the delight of the watching partisans, it buried itself, blazing all the while, in the very bosom of the shingled roof. A long redoubled shout of applause followed the achievement, and but a few moments had elapsed when Barsfield became conscious of the new danger which awaited him. “Ha!” he cried, as he beheld the position which Singleton had taken behind the tree, which, however, only in part concealed him. “Send me a score of bullets at the rebel, or he will smoke us out like so many rats. Shoot, men! take good aim, and stop him before it be too late.” A dozen muskets poured forth their contents in the direction of the daring partisan. The bullets flew all around him where he stood, but he stood unhurt. The moment after their fire was favourable to another effort; and, cool and thoughtful, Singleton was soon ready with a second shaft. Once more the whizzing arrow went blazing as fiercely and furiously as the first, and aimed with equal judgment at a different portion of the roof. Another and another followed in quick succession, in spite of the successive volleys of musketry which poured around him from the dwelling. In a little while the success of the experiment was no longer questionable. “It burns! it burns!” was the cry from the surrounding partisans, and the surface of the roof was now sprinkled with jets of flame, that flickered along the dry shingles, gathering new bulk with every instant, and spreading themselves away in thin layers of light, until the air, agitated into currents by the progress of the fire, contributed to send it in huge volumes, rolling on and upward into the sky. Shout upon shout from the lips of the partisans attested their joy, and congratulated their successful captain, through whose fearless and skilful agency the design had been effected. Their cheering cries, more than any thing besides, announced to the tories the new dangers of their situation, and the desperate position in which they stood. Singleton well conceived what might be their course, and gave his orders accordingly. “Riflemen! stand by to watch the scuttle. Look out for the roof! Mark the scuttle, and shoot closely!” Ascending to the garret by the aid of a little ladder which always stood there for such a purpose, Barsfield himself proceeded to throw open the scuttle, when he was warned of the watchfulness of the besiegers by the sharp crack of the rifle and the instantaneous passage of the bullet through the scuttle door, and just above his head. “Too quick, Lance! too quick by half!” cried Singleton to the precipitate youth, who had fired before the 18* tory's head had made its appearance. The boy sank back abashed and mortified. Barsfield, meanwhile, descended with much greater rapidity than satisfaction, and the dense smoke rushed down the aperture after him, filling the chambers with its suffocating and increasing masses. “It burns like tinder, and we have no water,” said Clayton. “And if we had,” cried Barsfield, fiercely, “who in the devil's name would apply it under the fire from those rifles?” “And what are we to do?” cried one of the subordinates, imboldened by the near approach of a common danger; “Shall we stay here to be smoked alive like so many wild beasts in a hole?” “Should we not now surrender, Captain Barsfield, if we can get fair terms of quarter?” was the suggestion of Clayton. “What! beg terms of that youngster? Never!” fiercely responded the tory. “I will perish first!” “Ay, but we shall all perish with you, and I see no good reason for that, Captain Barsfield,” was the calmer speech of Clayton. “We should apply for quarters to any youngster, rather than be smoked alive.” “And, if you did apply, would they hear us, think you? Would they grant us the terms which we have already refused with insult and disdain. No, no, Lieutenant Clayton; they would cry `Tarleton's quarters' in your ears in answer to all your applications, and taunt you, while your limbs dangled upon yonder oak, with our own good doings of the same sort.” “What then? Are we to stay here and perish by a death so horrid? Shall we not rather sally forth and fight?” “Yes! fight them to the last, of course,” was the response of Barsfield. “There is a mode, and but one that I can see, of getting out from these difficulties, I've escaped a worse chance than the present; and, with a good sword and stout heart, I fear not to escape from this.” “Speak, Barsfield, how?” cried Clayton, impatiently. “Mount our horses and cut our way through the rebels. They have dismounted and put their horses out of ready reach; and, if we cut our way through them, we shall get start enough to keep ahead of them before they can mount.” “Ay, ay—a good enough plan, were we mounted; but the first step that carries us beyond these walls puts us in the eye of their rifles. How shall we get to our horses, unless by first exposing ourselves in the piazza?” “You are but young as a soldier, Lieutenant Clayton,” was the sarcastic response of the tory captain, “and have much to learn in the way of war and its escapes. I will show you how we shall reach the horses without exposing ourselves, until we rush forth, armed, and upon their backs, prepared for fight as well as our enemies. Every man will then be required to rely upon himself; and, for the hindmost, God help him! for we may not. Where's Fenwicke?” he concluded, looking round among the men, whose faces the crowding smoke was already beginning to obscure. “Here, sir,” cried the man, coming forward. “Unsling your axe and throw off your jacket,” cried the tory, coolly: “shut your mouth, if you please, sir; you can do nothing so long as you keep it thus ajar. Is your axe ready?” “It is, sir,” was the reply; and, under the direction of Barsfield, the soldier proceeded to tear away the washboard which fastened down the edges of the floor, and then to rip up two or three boards of the floor itself— a duty soon performed by the vigorous axeman. By this time, however, the smoke had become dense and almost insupportable; and the moment the aperture was made in the floor, admitting them to the lower or basement story, where the horses had been stabled, with a rapidity that defied all the efforts of their cooler commander, the tories, huddled upon one another, hurried and tumbled through, glad to escape from their late predicament, even with the chances before them of a hopeless and desperate struggle such as Barsfield had painted to their eyes. The stern calmness of their leader, during all this proceeding, was creditable in the highest degree. He exhibited no hurry—no apprehension,— none of that precipitate haste which defeats execution, while it exhibits deficient character. When he got below, he himself saw that each man had mounted his proper steed and stood in readiness before he took the bridle of his own. He then asked if all were ready: he placed himself in the advance, gave orders to one of the men to turn the latch, but not to unclose the door— a duty which he reserved to himself, and then addressed them in terms of the most encouraging composure. “Have no fear, men! but each man, as he passes through the door, will at once strike for the entrance of the avenue. The brick foundations of the piazza and the smoke will conceal you for a few moments. I will go first from this hole, but I will be the last to move. Lieutenant Clayton will follow me out, but he will lead the way to the avenue. Follow him; keep cool—keep straight forward, and only turn when you turn to strike a foe. Are all ready?” “Ay, sir, all ready!” was the reply. With the words, with his own steed behind him, Barsfield, on foot, led him forth, and was the first to emerge into the light. He was not instantly perceived by the assailants, such was the cloud of smoke between them and the dwelling; but when, one after another, with a fearful rush, each trooper bounded forth, driving forward with relentless spur to the avenue in front, then did Singleton, becoming conscious of their flight, give his orders for pursuit. “Double quick step, riflemen,—hurry on with you, and skirt the fence! Your rifles will then cover them as they fly, and Mellichampe will answer for the rest. Quick step, men, or you lose the fire!” The partisans were prompt enough in obeying these orders, but there had been some miscalculation in the distance, or the speed of fear had not been taken into the estimate of those advantages, possessed by the enemy, for which Singleton believed himself prepared. The tories were already in the avenue before the riflemen reached the skirts of the park. Barsfield, bringing up the rear, his huge form erect, his hand waving defiance, was the only individual at whom a shot was obtained. At him several bullets were sped; but there is a something in the daring indifference of boldness which not unfrequently deranges the truest aim of an enemy. The tory was unhurt, yet some of the rifles pointed at his back were held by the best marksmen of the lower country. But a new enemy sprang up in the pathway of the tory, and the sabre of the impetuous Mellichampe once more clashed with that of his enemy. “Ha!—ha!” cried Mellichampe, “you were long in coming, but I have you now. You are mine at last!” There was a demoniac delight in the expression of the youth's countenance as, with these words, he confronted his foe. “Stand aside, boy!” was the hoarse reply of the tory, as, wheeling his horse to the opposite hand of the avenue, he seemed rather disposed to pass than to encounter the youth. Mellichampe regarded no other enemy, and the troop of Barsfield mingled pell-mell in the strife with the partisans, who were scattered before them up the avenue. With the sidling movement of Barsfield, the steed of Mellichampe, under the impetuous direction of his rider, was wheeled directly across his path, and the tory saw, at a glance, that the encounter could not be avoided. Preparing for it, therefore, with all his energies, he threw aside the weapon of his enemy, and the swords recoiled from each other in the fierce collision, as if with an instinct of their own. Again they bounded and buckled together; and then there was a momentary pause in the combat, as the weapons crossed in air, in which the eyes of the inveterate foes glared upon each other with the thirstful expression of demoniac hate. Like lightning then, for a few moments, the opposing blades darted around each combatant's head; then came the deadly thrust and the heavy blow—the ready guard, and the swift stroke in return. Though brave enough in common parlance, there was yet that in the face of Mellichampe from which the tory seemed to shrink. The youth had been roused by repeated wrongs, and maddened by continued disappointments, which defeated his promised hope of vengeance. The accumulated venom of a fierce and injured spirit shot forth from his eye, and gave a dreadful earnestness to every effort of his arm, so that the inequality of physical strength between himself and his enemy did not at first seem so evident. The consciousness of having wronged the youth, and the moral inferiority which, in all respects, he felt to him, neutralized in some degree the natural advantage which the tory possessed of greater muscle, and the acquired advantage of greater skill and experience. How else, indeed, could one so slender as Mellichampe,—his bones not yet hardened to manhood, and he yet in the gristle of youth,—contend so long and so equally with a frame so huge as that of Barsfield? How else, if the heart were not conscious of right in the one and of wrong in the other, could the former put aside the weighty blow of his enemy with so much ease, and respond to it with so much power? Thrice, in the deadliest stroke, had he foiled the tory, and now he pressed on him in return. “It is now for me, villain,” cried the youth, as he struck the rowel into his steed, and rose upon his stirrups a moment after, to give point with a downward stroke at the breast of his enemy, whose steed had sunk, under the sudden press of his rider's curb, backward upon his haunches— “It is now my turn, villain, and my father's blood clamours for that of his murderer. Have at your heart. Ha!” The stroke was descending, and was with difficulty parried by the sabre of the tory. It was put aside, however, at the utmost stretch of Barsfield's arm—his body being writhed round into an unnatural position for that purpose. The danger was only delayed. In another moment he felt assured that the stroke of Mellichampe—a backward stroke—must be repeated, and that he could not recover his seat in time to ward it aside; but, ere the youth could effect his object—to which he had addressed his entire energies, conscious that he now had the tory at complete advantage—the forefeet of his horse struck upon the carcass of a slain soldier, which slipped from under him, yet carrying him forward, till he stumbled irrecoverably and came to his knees. The moment was lost; and, in the next, Barsfield had recovered his seat, from which the force of Mellichampe's assaults, and the efforts necessary for his own defence, had half uplifted him. It was his turn now to press upon his foe. Wheeling his horse suddenly round, he dealt him a heavy blow upon the shoulder of his sword-arm, which precipitated the youth to the earth, while wounding him severely. The tory would have paused to render his victory more complete; but, as he looked upon the avenue before him, he saw that he was isolated. Cutting their way, without pausing for any particular encounter such as had controlled the flight of their leader, his men had sped onward; and, though fighting with the partisans at every step, had yet succeeded in carrying the fight forward to the entrance. The tory captain saw that he had no time for delay. Witherspoon, who had been busily engaged, was now pressing towards him, closely followed by another; and, though casting a wistful look upon his prostrate enemy, as if he longed to make certain his victory, the safety of his own life depended upon his haste, and was infinitely more important to him than even the death of so deadly an enemy as Mellichampe. Even now it was doubtful what success would attend his endeavour to pass the scattered partisans who lay in his path; and he felt that all his energies were required to meet the shock of Witherspoon, who was fast approaching. While thus he prepared himself, the shrill clamour of a fresh trumpet broke suddenly upon his sense, and brought him relief. It announced the coming of a new force, and the probability was that it was British. Of this Barsfield, in another moment, had no doubt, as he saw Witherspoon, no longer seeking the conflict, rush past him in the direction of the burning mansion. The woodman had beheld the steel caps and the blue uniforms of the approaching force, and at once recognised the formidable corps, two hundred strong, of the legionary Tarleton. Barsfield rode on to meet his superior, and explain the situation of affairs before him. Witherspoon, meanwhile, leaping from his horse, which he let go free, rushed to the spot where Mellichampe had fallen. “Airnest! Airnest, boy!” he cried, as he stooped down to the insensible body; “Speak to me, Airnest— speak to me,—it's me, Jack,—it's Thumbscrew, Airnest. Only say something—only a word—I don't care what you says, Airnest; but say something. God ha' mercy! He don't hear!—he can't talk. Airnest! Airnest!” A groan met his ears and half relieved him. “Thank God, it 'taint so bad. He's got life in him yet; and, if I can only carry him out of the way of the horses, and let Miss Janet know where to find him—” Thus speaking, he raised the insensible body in his arms, and hurried with him towards the ditch, over which he sought to pass. His aim was to carry the youth into the thick copse beyond, where he could place him out of sight of the approaching enemy. But he had overtasked his own strength, after the severe fatigue and fighting which he had undergone, and the labour called for more time than the circumstances of the field would allow. The advance of Tarleton was too rapid to permit of his performing the affectionate service which he contemplated for his friend; and, before he reached the ditch, the swords of the legion were flashing before his eyes, as the troop wheeled round a bend in the avenue which hitherto had concealed him from their sight. “Gimini! I must leave him. I must put you down, Airnest! I can't help it, boy! I did the best!” He spoke to the insensible youth as if he could hear; and, with a groan that seemed to come from the bottom of his soul, he laid the body down in the ditch, where it was partially concealed from sight in the hollow and by the tufts and bushes which grew along its margin. Then, with a grim look of despair cast behind him as he fled, he leaped across the ditch, passed hurriedly through the copse and bordering foliage, and soon gained the station at the bottom of the hill, which had been assigned by Singleton at the commencement of the fray as the place of general rendezvous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XXIII. Chafed with the excitement of battle, and mortified with the humiliation of defeat, Barsfield dashed forward to meet with Tarleton, to whom he conveyed the particulars of the affray. It needed but few words to do this Vol. I.—K 19 at such a moment—the scene was in progress even then before the eyes of the legionary. The wild shouts of the partisans, scattered along the fields, and flying from the greater force approaching them—the occasional sounds of the rifle—the lurid glare of the flames, ascending in gigantic columns from the burning mansion, sufficiently informed the ready senses of a leader so intelligent and sagacious as the practised Tarleton. He was a man of deeds rather than of words, and a few brief, quick questions drew from Barsfield all that he sought to know. “What number of rifles, Captain Barsfield, has Major Singleton?” “Some thirty, sir, or more.” “What other force?” “Ten or twenty horse, which we had first broken through, sir, on your approach.” “And from which our approach saved you?” Barsfield bowed. Tarleton waved his hand, and gave his troop their orders with coolness and decision. In the next moment he led them forward with a fleet pace down the avenue, towards the burning dwelling and the park. He thought to find his enemy scattered and unprepared, as he now and then beheld in the distance, by the light of the flames, an occasional figure darting by, seemingly in flight, and the shouts of the partisans rose here and there from opposite quarters of the area. The sight of these figures and the insulting shouts stimulated his advance, and aroused his natural appetite for strife. With habitual impetuosity, he hurried forward in a quick trot, making for the point which most immediately promised him an encounter with his foe. He found them much sooner than he had expected. His enemy was prepared for him. Singleton was apprized of the approach of Tarleton quite as soon as Barsfield in the avenue, and he now prepared to execute the orders of Marion, for which the present condition of things gave him a favourable opportunity. He threw his men without the park. The fences lay between the two parties. One half of his force he immediately sent down the hill to prepare the horses, putting them in readiness for instant flight. His riflemen, who had been too late to check the retreat of Barsfield, were nevertheless just in time on the outer edge of the park, and skirting one side of the avenue, with its thick copse interposing sufficiently to protect them from a charge of cavalry, to gall the advance of Tarleton. They received their orders, and stood prepared to execute them. Covered by the trees, each man stood in silence, prepared to single out his enemy, and immediately after scud off along the fences, and join his comrades at the foot of the hill. Cool and watchful, Singleton remained at hand to watch the progress of both parties. He himself had prepared to do a like duty with his men. He had thrown aside the sabre, and a favourite rifle in his hands was quite as deadly a weapon as in that of any other of his troop. The legion came bounding forward, and the signal for their hostile reception came from the rifle of the partisan commander. It had its echoes—each an echo of death— and the advancing column of Tarleton, in that narrow avenue, reeled and recoiled under the fatal discharge. A dozen troopers fell from their saddles with the fire, stiffening in the fast embrace of death, and scarce conscious of their wounds. But in another instant the fierce voice of Tarleton, clamorous and shrill, rose like that of a trumpet above all other sounds— “Scoundrels, forward! Wherefore do ye pause? Through the bush to the right—charge, rascals, ere I cleave ye down to the earth! Charge the d—d rebels —charge—and give no quarter!” The ditch was cleared—the obedient troopers, accustomed hitherto only to victory under the lead of Tarleton, went over the bank and scrambled through the copse with more daring than success. The overhanging K 2 branches were hewn away in an instant—a path was cleared for the advance through the close foliage, and, like bold cavaliers, a score of the troopers made their way through the obstruction. But where was the enemy? Where were they whose fatal rifles had dealt them so much loss? They had melted away like so many shadows—they were gone. Fiercely the dragoons dealt idle blows upon the surrounding bushes, which might have been supposed to shelter a lurking rifleman, but their sabres clashed together and found no foe. The partisans had vanished from their sight, but they had not yet gone. While yet the dragoons gazed bewildered and in wonderment, the repeated shot from the same select and deadly marksmen singled them out, one by one, from another sheltered clump of wood, not more than fifty yards in advance; and the remaining few who had passed into the open ground and were still exposed, could hear the distinct commands of Singleton— “Another round, men—one more. Each his man.” The partisan had managed admirably, but he was now compelled to fly. The advantage of ground was no longer with him. Tarleton, with his entire force, had now passed through the avenue, and had appeared in the open court in front. The necessity of rapid flight now became apparent to Singleton, and the wild lively notes of his trumpet were accordingly heard stirring the air at not more than rifle distance from the gathering troop of Tarleton. Bitterly aroused by this seeming audacity— an audacity to which Tarleton, waging a war hitherto of continual successes, had never been accustomed, his ire grew into fury— “What, men! shall these rebels carry it so?” he cried aloud. “Advance, Captain Barsfield—advance to the right of the fence with twenty men, and stop not to mark your steps. Advance, sir, and charge forward. You should know the ground by this time. Away!” To another he cried—striking the neck of his steed impatiently with the broad side of his sabre— “Captain Kearney, to you wood! Sweep it, sir, with your sabres; and meet me in the rear of the garden!” The officers thus commanded moved to the execution of their charges with sufficient celerity. The commands and movements of Major Singleton were much more cool and not less prompt. He hurried along by his scattered men, as they lay here and there, covered by this or that bush or tree. “Carry off no bullets that you can spare them, men —fire as soon as they reach the garden, and, when your pieces are clear, take down the hill and mount.” Three minutes did not elapse before the rifles had each poured forth its treasured death; and, without pausing to behold the effects of their discharge, each partisan, duly obedient, was on his way, leaping off from cover to cover through the thick woods to the hollow where their horses had been fastened. The furious Tarleton meanwhile led the way through the garden, the palings of which were torn away to give his cavalry free passage. With a soldier's rage, and the impatience of one not often baffled, he hurried forward the pursuit, in a line tolerably direct, after the flying partisans. But Singleton was too good a soldier, and too familiar with the ground, to keep his men in mass in a wild flight through woods becoming denser at every step. When they had reached a knoll at some little distance beyond the place where his horses had been fastened, he addressed his troop as follows:— “We must break here, my men. Each man will take his own path, and we will all scatter as far apart as possible. Make your way, all of you, for the swamp, however; where, in a couple of hours, you may all be safe. Lance Frampton, you will ride with me.” Each trooper knew the country, and, accustomed to individual enterprise and the duties of the scout, there 19* was no hardship to the men of Marion in such a separation. On all hands they glided off, and at a far freer pace than when they rode together in a body. A thousand tracks they found in the woods about them, in pursuing which there was now no obstruction—no justling of brother horsemen pressing upon the same route. Singleton and his youthful companion darted away at an easy pace into the woods, in which they had scarcely shrouded themselves before they heard the rushing and fierce cries of Tarleton's dragoons. “Do you remember, Lance,” said Singleton to the boy—“do you remember the chase we had from the Oaks, when Proctor pursued us?” “Yes, sir—and a narrow chance it was when your horse tumbled. I thought they would have caught and killed you then, sir; but I didn't know any thing of fighting in the woods then.” “Keep cool, and there's little danger anywhere,” responded Singleton. “Men in a hurry are always in danger. To be safe, be steady. But—ha! do you not hear them now? Some of them have got upon our track.” “I do hear a noise, sir—there was a dry bush that cracked then.” “And a voice—that was a shout. Let us stop for a moment and reload. A shot may be wanted.” Coolly dismounting, Singleton proceeded to charge his rifle, which had been slung across his shoulder. His companion did the same. While loading, the former felt a slight pain and stiffness in his left arm. “I am hurt, Lance, I do believe. Look here at my shoulder.” “There's blood, sir—and the coat's cut with a bullet. The bullet's in your arm, sir.” “No—not now. It has been there, I believe, though the wound is slight. There, now—mount—we have no time to see it now.” “That's true, sir, for I hear the horses; and, look now, major, there's two of the dragoons coming through the bush, and straight towards us.” “Two only?” said Singleton, again unslinging his rifle. The boy readily understood the movement, and proceeded to do likewise, but he was too late. The shot of Singleton was immediate, and the foremost trooper fell forward from his horse. His companion fled. “Don't 'light, Lance—keep on. There's only one now, and he won't trouble us. The other—poor devil! his horse was too fleet for his master's safety. Away, sir.” It was time to speed. The report of the shot and the fall of the dragoon gave a direction to the whole force of the pursuers, whose shouts and cries might now be heard ringing in all directions of the forest behind them. “They can't reach us, Lance. We shall round that bay in a few seconds, and they will be sure to boggle into it. On, boy, and waste no eyesight in looking behind you. We are safe. I only hope that all our boys are as much so. But I fear that we have lost some fine fellows. Poor Mellichampe!—but it is too late now. Push on—the bay is before us.” Thus speaking, guiding and encouraging the boy, the fearless partisan kept on. In a few minutes they had rounded the thick bay, and were deeply sheltered in a dense wood, well known at that period by a romantic title, which doubtless had its story. “My Lady's Fancy. We are safe now, Lance, and a little rest will do no harm.” The partisan, as he spoke, drew up his horse, threw himself from his back, fastened him to a hanging branch, and, passing down to a hollow where a little brooklet ran trickling along with a gentle murmur, drank deeply of its sweet and quiet waters, which he scooped up with a calabash that hung on a bough, waving in the breeze above. Then, throwing himself down under the shadow of the tree, he lay as quietly as if there had been no danger tracking his footsteps, and no deadly enemy still prowling in the neighbourhood and hungering for his blood. The chase was given over, and the lively tones of the bugle recalled the pursuers. The legionary colonel stood upon a hillock, awaiting the return of the men, who came in slowly and half exhausted from the profitless pursuit. He wiped the dust and the sweat from his brow, but a rigid and deep blue vein lay like a cord across his forehead. A gloomy cloud hung about his eyes, and yet his lips, pale, and seemingly passionless, were parted with a smile. They quivered slightly, and the tips of his white teeth rested upon the lower lip for a moment, as if to control his speech, when he beheld the person of the tory captain among those approaching him. “And now—what of this affair, Captain Barsfield? We have time now to speak of it,” was the salutation of Tarleton; and he alighted from his steed as he spoke, and the point of his sabre was made to revolve quickly, while he listened, upon the up-curling peak of his thick military boot. Barsfield briefly narrated the events which we have witnessed, and, saving some little natural exaggeration of the numbers on the side of the partisans, with tolerable correctness. The narrative, as he listened, did not seem to diminish the disquiet of his hearer. “But fifty men, you say?—the entire force of the rebels but fifty men!—and your force, if I err not, thirty at the least. But fifty men!” “There may have been—indeed, sir, there must have been—more; and—” “A bad business, sir—a very bad business, Captain Barsfield,” said the other, interrupting him. “The affair has not been rightly managed, though where the defect lay may not now be said. What force was it you encountered in the morning?” “A squad of thirty, sir, and more. I had defeated them, and they would have been cut to pieces, but for the sudden appearance of the troop of Major Singleton, which you have just dispersed.” “No more, sir—no more. Take your men, and examine the ground and the avenue. See to the wounded prisoners, Captain Barsfield—have them well secured, and ascertain the extent of your own loss. There must be an inquiry into this business quickly. Move, sir— we have no time to lose.” The blood mounted into the tory's cheek as he listened to these orders—the fire of intense satisfaction glared and gathered in his eye, and, fearful that his feeling would be seen by the piercing glance of Tarleton, he turned away instantly in the execution of his orders. A fierce hope of vengeance, yet to be satisfied, was at his heart. He had not forgotten that his mortal enemy lay wounded on that field. He knew that, although wounded, Mellichampe was yet alive. The command to scour the scene of conflict was precisely the command which he most desired; affording him, as it did, an opportunity of making certain the stroke which, even in the hurry of battle, he had considered incomplete. A fierce emotion of delight, under which he trembled, seized upon his frame as he heard the command; and, bowing with ill-concealed satisfaction to his superior, he hurried away with all the rapidity of a newly-stimulated passion, not merely to the execution of his orders, but to the final consummation of his own bloody scheme of vengeance—the death of that hated rival, in the pursuit of which he had been so often baffled when most sanguine of success. The knife was now in his hand, however, and the devoted victim lay before him. END OF VOL. I.</field>
