      <field name="fulltext">2 PROBUS. The record which follows, is by the hand of me, Nichomachus, once the happy servant of the great Queen of Palmyra, than whom the world never saw a queen more illustrious, nor a woman adorned with brighter virtues. But my design is not to write her eulogy, nor recite the wonderful story of her life. That task requires a stronger and a more impartial hand than mine. The life of Zenobia by Nichomachus, would be the portrait of a mother and a divinity, drawn by the pen of a child and a worshipper. My object is a humbler, but perhaps also a more useful one. It is to collect and arrange, in their proper order, such of the letters of the most noble Lucius Manlius Piso, as shall throw most light upon his character and times, supplying all defects of incident, and filling up all chasms that may occur, out of the knowledge which, more exactly than any one else, I have been able to gather concerning all that relates to the distinguished family of the Pisos, after its connection with the more distinguished one still, of the Queen of Palmyra. It is in this manner that I propose to amuse the few remaining days of a green old age, not without hope both to amuse and benefit others also. This is a labor, as those will discover who read, not unsuitable to one who stands trembling on the verge of life, and whom a single rude blast may in a moment consign to the embraces of the universal mother. I will not deny that my chief satisfaction springs from the fact, that in collecting these letters, and binding them together by a connecting narrative, I am engaged in the honorable task of tracing out some of the steps by which the new religion has risen to its present height of power. For whether true or false, neither friend nor foe, neither philosopher nor fool, can refuse to admit the regenerating and genial influences of its so wide reception upon the Roman character and manners. If not the gift of the gods, it is every way worthy a divine origin; and I cannot but feel myself to be worthily occupied in recording the deeds, the virtues, and the sufferings, of those who put their faith in it, and, in times of danger and oppression, stood forth to defend it. Age is slow of belief. The thoughts then cling with a violent pertinacity to the fictions of its youth, once held to be the most sacred realities. But for this I should, I believe, myself long ago have been a Christian. I daily pray to the Supreme Power that my stubborn nature may yet so far yield, that I may be able, with a free and full assent, to call myself a follower of Christ. A Greek by birth, a Palmyrene by choice and adoption, a Roman by necessity — and these are all honorable names — I would yet rather be a Christian than either. Strange that, with so strong desires after a greater good, I should remain fixed where I have ever been! Stranger still, seeing I have moved so long in the same sphere with the excellent Piso, the divine Julia — that emanation of God — and the god-like Probus! But there is no riddle so hard for man to read as himself. I sometimes feel most inclined toward the dark fatalism of the stoics, since it places all things beyond the region of conjecture or doubt. Yet if I may not be a Christian myself — I do not, however, cease both to hope and pray — I am happy in this, that I am permitted by the Divine Providence to behold, in these the last days of life, the quiet supremacy of a faith which has already added so much to the common happiness, and promises so much more. Having stood in the midst, and looked upon the horrors of two persecutions of the Christians — the first by Aurelian and the last by Diocletian—and which last seemed at one moment as if it would accomplish its work, and blot out the very name of Christian — I have no language in which to express the satisfaction with which I sit down beneath the peaceful shadows of a Christian throne, and behold the general security and exulting freedom enjoyed by the many millions throughout the vast empire of the great Constantine. Now, everywhere around, the Christians are seen, undeterred by any apprehension of violence, with busy hands reërecting the demolished temples of their pure and spiritual faith; yet not unmindful, in the meantime, of the labor yet to be done, to draw away the remaining multitudes of idolaters from the superstitions which, while they infatuate, degrade and brutalize them. With the zeal of the early apostles of this religion, they are applying themselves, with untiring diligence, to soften and subdue the stony heart of hoary Paganism, receiving but too often, as their only return, curses and threats — now happily vain — but often again retiring from the assault, leading in glad triumph captive multitudes. Often, as I sit at my window, overlooking, from the southern slope of the Quirinal, the magnificent Temple of the Sun, the proudest monument of Aurelian's reign, do I pause to observe the labors of the artificers who, just as it were beneath the shadow of its columns, are placing the last stones upon the dome of a Christian church. Into that church the worshippers shall enter unmolested; mingling peacefully, as they go and return, with the crowds that throng the more gorgeous temple of the idolaters. Side by side, undisturbed and free, do the Pagans and Christians, Greeks, Jews, and Egyptians, now observe the rites, and offer the worship, of their varying faiths. This happiness we owe to the wise and merciful laws of the great Constantine. So was it, long since, in Palmyra, under the benevolent rule of Zenobia. May the time never come, when Christians shall do otherwise than now; when, remembering the wrongs they have received, they shall retaliate torture and death upon the blind adherents of the ancient superstitions! These letters of Piso to Fausta the daughter of Gracchus, now follow. 2*</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER I. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. I am not surprised, Fausta, that you complain of my silence. It were strange indeed if you did not. But as for most of our misdeeds we have excuses ready at hand, so have I for this. First of all, I was not ignorant that, however I might fail you, from your other greater friend you would experience no such neglect; but on the contrary would be supplied, with sufficient fullness and regularity, with all that could be worth knowing, concerning either our public or private affairs. For her sake, too, I was not unwilling, that at first the burden of this correspondence, if I may so term it, should rest where it has, since it has afforded, I am persuaded, a pleasure, and provided an occupation that could have been found nowhere else. Just as a flood of tears brings relief to a bosom laboring under a heavy sorrow, so has this pouring out of herself to you, in frequent letters, served to withdraw her mind from recollections which, dwelt upon as they were at first, would soon have ended that life in which all ours seem bound up. Then again, if you accept the validity of this excuse, I have another, which, as a woman, you will at once allow the force of. You will not deem it a better one than the other, but doubtless as good. It is this: that for a long time I have been engaged in taking possession of my new dwelling upon the Cœlian, not far from that of Portia. Of this you may have heard, in the letters which have reached you; but that will not prevent me from describing to you, with more exactness than any other can have done it, the home of your old and fast friend, Lucius Manlius Piso; for I think it adds greatly to the pleasure with which we think of an absent friend, to be able to see, as in a picture, the form and material and position of the house he inhabits, and even the very aspect and furniture of the room in which he is accustomed to pass the most of his time. This to me is a satisfaction greater than you can well conceive, when, in my ruminating hours, which are many, I return to Palmyra, and place myself in the circle with Gracchus, Calpurnius, and yourself. Your palace having now been restored to its former condition, I know where to find you at the morning, noon, and evening hour; the only change you have made in the former arrangements being this: that whereas when I was your guest, your private apartments occupied the eastern wing of the palace, they are now in the western, once mine, and which I used then to maintain were the most agreeable and noble of all. The prospects which its windows afford of the temple, and the distant palace of the queen, and of the evening glories of the setting sun, are more than enough to establish its claims to an undoubted superiority; and if to these be added the circumstance, that for so long a time the Roman Piso was their occupant, the case is made out beyond all peradventure. But I am describing your palace rather than my own. You must remember my paternal seat on the southern declivity of the hill, and overlooking the course of the Tiber, as it winds away to the sea. Mine is not far from it, but on the northern side of the hill, and thereby possessing a situation more favorable to comfort, during the heats of summer — I loving the city, as you well know, better if anything during the summer than the winter months. Standing upon almost the highest point of the hill, it commands a wide and beautiful prospect, especially toward the north and east, the eye shooting over the whole expanse of city and suburbs, and then resting upon the purple outline of the distant mountains. Directly before me are the magnificent structures which crown the Esquiline, conspicuous among which, and indeed eminent over all, are the Baths of Titus. Then, as you will conjecture, the eye takes in the Palatine and Capitol hills, catching, just beyond the last, the swelling dome of the Pantheon, which seems rather to rise out of, and crown, the Flavian Amphitheatre, than its own massy walls. Then, far in the horizon, we just discern the distant summits of the Appenines, broken by Soracte and the nearer hills. The principal apartments are on the northern side of the palace, opening upon a portico of Corinthian columns, running its entire length, and which would not disgrace Palmyra itself. At the eastern extremity, are the rooms common to the family; in the centre, a spacious hall, in the adorning of which, by every form of art, I have exhausted my knowledge and taste in such things; and at the western extremity, my library, where at this moment I sit, and where I have gathered around me all in letters and art that I most esteem. This room I have decorated for myself and Julia — not for others. Whatever has most endeared itself to our imaginations, our minds, or our hearts, has here its home. The books that have most instructed or amused; the statuary that most raises and delights us; the pictures on which we most love to dwell; the antiquities that possess most curiosity or value, are here arranged; and in an order that would satisfy, I believe, even your fastidious taste. I will not weary you with any more minute account of my new dwelling, leaving that duty to the readier pen of Julia. Yet I cannot relieve you till I have spoken of two of the statues which occupy the most conspicuous niche in the library. You will expect me to name Socrates and Plato, or Numa and Seneca — these are all there, but it is not of either of them that I would speak. They are the venerable founders of the Jewish and Christian religions, Moses and Christ. These statues, of the purest marble, stand side by side, at one extremity of the apartment; and immediately before them, and within the wondrous sphere of their influences, stands the table at which I write, and where I pursue my inquiries in philosophy and religion. You smile at my enthusiasm, Fausta, and wonder when I shall return to the calm sobriety of my ancient faith. In this wonder there are a thousand errors — but of these hereafter. I was to tell you of these sculptures. Of the statue of Moses, I possess no historical account, and know not what its claim may be to truth. I can only say, it is a figure truly grand, and almost terrific. It is of a size larger than life, and expresses no sentiment so perfectly as authority — the authority of a rigorous and austere ruler — both in the attitude of the body and the features of the countenance. The head is slightly raised and drawn back, as if listening, awe-struck, to a communication from the God who commissioned him, while his left hand supports a volume, and his right grasps a stylus, with which, when the voice has ceased, to record the communicated truth. Place in his hands the thunderbolt, and at his feet the eagle, and the same form would serve for Jupiter the Thunderer, except only that to the countenance of the Jewish prophet there has been imparted a rapt and inspired look, wholly beyond any that even Phidias could have fixed upon the face of Jove. He who wrought this head must have believed in the sublimities of the religion whose chief minister he has made so to speak them forth, in the countenance and in the form; and yet who has ever heard of a Jew sculptor? The statue of Christ is of a very different character; as different as the Christian faith is from that of the Jewish, notwithstanding they are still by many confounded. I cannot pretend to describe to you the holy beauty that as it were constitutes this perfect work of art. If you ask what authority tradition has invested it with, I can only say that I do not know. All I can affirm with certainty, is this, that it once stood in the palace of Alexander Severus, in company with the images of other deified men and gods, whom he chiefly reverenced. When that excellent prince had fallen under the blows of assassins, his successor and murderer, Maximin, having little knowledge or taste for what was found in the palace of Alexander, those treasures were sold, and the statue of Christ came into the hands of a distinguished and wealthy Christian of that day, who, perishing in the persecution of Decius, his descendants became impoverished, and were compelled to part with even this sacred relic of their former greatness. From them I purchased it; and often are they to be seen, whenever for such an object they can steal away from necessary cares, standing before it and renewing, as it would seem, their vows of obedience, in the presence of the founder of their faith. The room is free to their approach, whenever they are thus impelled. The expression of this statue, I have said, is wholly different from that of the Hebrew. His is one of authority and of sternness; this of gentleness and love. Christ is represented, like the Moses, in a sitting posture, with a countenance, not like his raised to Heaven, but bent with looks somewhat sad and yet full of benevolence, as if upon persons standing before him. Fraternity, I think, is the idea you associate with it most readily. I should never suppose him to be a judge nor censor, nor arbitrary master, but rather an elder brother; elder in the sense of wiser, holier, purer; whose look is not one of reproach that others are not as himself, but of pity and desire; and whose hand would rather be stretched forth to lift up the fallen than to smite the offender. To complete this expression, and inspire the beholder with perfect confidence, the left hand rests upon a little child, who stands with familiar reverence at his knee, and looking up into his face seems to say, `No evil can come to me here.' Opposite this, and at the other extremity of the apartment, hangs a picture of Christ, representing him in very exact accordance with the traditional accounts of his features and form, a description of which exists, and is held by most authentic, in a letter of Publius Lentulus, a Roman of the same period. Between this and the statue there is a close resemblance, or as close as we usually see between two heads of Cæsar, or of Cicero. Marble, however, is the only material that suits the character and office of Jesus of Nazareth. Color, and its minute effects, seem in some sort to degrade the subject. I retain the picture because of its supposed truth. Portia, as you will believe, is full of wonder and sorrow at these things. Soon after my library had received its last additions, my mother came to see what she had already heard of so much. As she entered the apartment, I was sitting in my accustomed seat, with Julia at my side, and both of us gazing in admiration at the figures I have just described. We were both too much engrossed to notice the entrance of Portia, our first warning of her presence being her hand laid upon my head. We rose and placed her between us. `My son,' said she, looking intently as she spoke upon the statues before us, `what strange looking figures are these? That upon my left might serve for Jupiter, but for the roll and the stylus. And why place you beings of character so opposite, as these appear to have been, side by side? This other upon my right — ah, how beautiful it is! What mildness in those eyes, and what a divine repose over the form, which no event, not the downfall of a kingdom nor its loss, would seem capable to disturb. Is it the peace-loving Numa?' `Not so,' said Julia; `there stands Numa, leaning on the sacred shield, from the centre of which beams the countenance of the divine Egeria.' `Yes, I see it,' replied Portia; and rising from her seat, she stood gazing round the apartment, examining its various appointments. When her eye had sought out the several objects, and dwelt upon them a moment, she said, in tones somewhat reproachful, as much so as it is in her nature to assume. `Where, Lucius, are the gods of Rome? Do those who have, through so many ages, watched over our country, and guarded our house, deserve no honor at your hands? Does not gratitude require at least that their images should be here, so that, whether you yourself worship them or not, their presence may inspire others with reverence? But alas for the times! Piety seems dead; or, with the faith that inspires it, it lives but in a few, who will soon disappear, and religion with them. Whose forms are these, Lucius? concerning one I can now easily surmise — but the other, this stern and terrific man, who is he?' `That,' I replied, `is Moses, the founder of Judaism.' `Immortal gods!' exclaimed Portia, `the statue of a Jew in the halls of the Pisos! Well may it be that Rome approaches her decline, when her elder sons turn against her.' `Nay, mother, I am not a Jew.' `I would thou wert, rather than be what I suppose thou art, a Christian. The Jew, Lucius, can boast of antiquity, at least, in behalf of his religion. But the faith which you would profess and extend, is but of yesterday. Would the gods ever leave mankind without religion? Is it only to-day that they reveal the truth? Have they left us for these many ages to grope along in error? Never, Lucius, can I believe it. It is enough for me that the religion of Rome is old as Rome, to endear it to my heart, and commend it to my understanding. 3 It is not for the first time, to-day, that the gods have spoken.' `But, my dear mother,' I rejoined, `if age makes truth, there are older religions than this of Rome. Judaism itself is older, by many centuries. But it is not because a religion is new or old, that I would receive or reject it. The only question is, does it satisfy my heart and mind, and is it true? The faith which you, mother, engrafted upon my infant mind, fails to meet the wants of my nature, and upon looking for its foundations, I find them not.' `Is thy nature different from mine, Lucius? Surely, thou art my own child! It has satisfied me and my nature. I ask for nothing else, or better.' `There are some natures, mother, by the gods so furnished and filled with all good desires and affections, that their religion is born with them and is in them. It matters little under what outward form and administration of truth they dwell; no system could injure them — none would greatly benefit. They are of the family of God, by birth, and are never disinherited.' `Yes, Portia,' said Julia, `natural and divine instincts make you what others can become only through the powerful operation of some principle out of, and superior to, anything they find within themselves. For me, I know not what I should have been, without the help which Christianity has afforded. I might have been virtuous, but I could not have been happy. You surely rejoice when the weak find that in any religion or philosophy which gives them strength. Look, Portia, at that serene and benignant countenance, and can you believe that any truth ever came from its lips, but such as must be most comforting and exalting to those who receive it?' `It would seem so indeed, my child,' replied Portia, musingly, `and I would not deprive any of the comforts or strength which any principle may impart. But I cannot cease to think it dangerous to the state, when the faith of the founders of Rome is abandoned by those who fill its highest places. You who abound in leisure and learning, may satisfy yourselves with a new philosophy; but what shall these nice refinements profit the common herd? How shall they see them to be true, or comprehend them? The Romans have ever been a religious people; and although under the empire the purity of ancient manners is lost, let it not be said that the Pisos were among those who struck the last and hardest blows at the still stout root of the tree that bore them.' `Nothing can be more plain or intelligible,' I replied, `than the principles of the Christian religion; and wherever it has been preached with simplicity and power, even the common people have readily and gratefully adopted it. I certainly cannot but desire that it may prevail. If anything is to do it, I believe this is the power that is to restore, and in a still nobler form, the ancient manners of which you speak. It is from Christianity that in my heart I believe the youthful blood is to come, that being poured into the veins of this dying state, shall reproduce the very vigor and freshness of its early age. Rome, mother, is now but a lifeless trunk — a dead and loathsome corpse: a new and warmer current must be infused, or it will soon crumble into dust.' `I grieve, Lucius, to see you lost to the good cause of your country, and to the altars of her gods; for who can love his country, and deny the gods who made and preserve it? But then who am I to condemn? When I see the gods to hurl thunderbolts upon those who flout them, it will be time enough for us mortals to assume the robes of judgment. I will hope that farther thought will reclaim you from your truant wanderings.' Do not imagine, Fausta, that conversations like this have the least effect to chill the warm affections of Portia towards us both. Nature has placed within her bosom a central heat, that not only preserves her own warmth, but diffuses itself upon all who approach her, and changes their affections into a likeness of her own. We speak of our differing faiths, but love none the less. When she had paused a moment, after uttering the last words, she again turned her eye upon the statue of Christ, and, captivated by its wondrous power, she dwelt upon it in a manner that showed her sensibilities to be greatly moved. At length she suddenly started, saying: `If truth and beauty were the same thing, one need but to look upon this, and be a believer. But as in the human form and face, beauty is often but a lie, covering over a worse deformity than any that ever disfigures the body, so it may be here. I cannot but admire and love the beauty; it will be wise, I suppose, not to look farther, lest the dream be dissolved.' `Be not afraid of that, dearest mother; I can warrant you against disappointment. If in that marble you have the form of the outward beauty, here, in this roll, you will find the inward moral beauty of which it was the shrine.' `Nay, nay, Lucius, I look no farther or deeper. I have seen too much already.' With these words, she rose, and we accompanied her to the portico, where we walked, and sat, and talked of you, and Calpurnius, and Gracchus. Thus you perceive I have told you first of what chiefly interests myself: now let me turn to what at this moment more than everything else fills all heads in Rome — and that is Livia. She is the object of universal attention, the centre of all honor. It is indescribable, the sensation her beauty, and now added to that, her magnificence, have made and still make in Rome. Her imperial bearing would satisfy even you; and the splendor of her state exceeds all that has been known before. This you may be surprised to hear, knowing what the principles of Aurelian have been in such things; how strict he has been himself in a more than republican simplicity, and how severe upon the extravagances and luxuries of others, in the laws he has enacted. You must remember his prohibition of the use of cloth of gold and of silk, among other things — foolish laws to be suddenly promulged among so vain and corrupt a population as this of Rome. They have been the ridicule and scorn of rich and poor alike; of the rich, because they are so easily violated in private, or evaded by the substitution of one article for another; of the poor, because, being slaves in spirit, they take a slave's pride in the trappings and state of their masters; they love not only to feel but to see their superiority. But since the eastern expedition, the reduction of Palmyra, and the introduction from abroad of the vast flood of foreign luxuries 3* which have inundated Rome and Italy itself, the principles and the habits of the emperor have undergone a mighty revolution. Now, the richness and costliness of his dress, the splendor of his equipage, the gorgeousness of his furniture, cannot be made to come up to the height of his extravagant desires. The silk which he once denied to the former empress for a dress, now, variously embroidered, and of every dye, either hangs in ample folds upon the walls, or canopies the royal bed, or lends its beauty to the cushioned seats which everywhere, in every form of luxurious ease, invite to repose. Gold, too, once prohibited, but now wrought into every kind of cloth, or solid in shape of dish, or vase, or cup, or spread in sheets over the very walls and ceilings of the palace, has rendered the traditions of Nero's house of gold no longer fabulous. The customs of the eastern monarchs have also elevated or perverted the ambition of Aurelian, and one after another are taking place of former usages. He is every day more difficult of access, and surrounds himself, his palaces, and apartments, by guards and officers of state. In all this, as you will readily believe, Livia is his willing companion, or rather, I should perhaps say, his prompting and ruling genius. As without the world at her feet, it would be impossible for her insane pride to be fully satisfied, so in all that is now done, the emperor still lags behind her will. But beautifully, it can be denied by none, does she become her greatness, and gives more lustre than she receives, to all around her. Gold is doubly gold in her presence; and even the diamond sparkles with a new brilliancy on her brow or sandal. Livia is, of all women I have ever seen or known, made for a Roman empress. I used to think so when in Palmyra, and I saw her, so often as I did, assuming the port and air of imaginary sovereignty. And now that I behold her filling the very place for which by nature she is most perfectly fitted, I cannot but confess that she surpasses all I had imagined, in the genius she displays for her great sphere, both as wife of Aurelian, and sovereign of Rome. Her intellect shows itself stronger than I had believed it to be, and secures for her the homage of a class who could not be subdued by the magnificence of her state, extraordinary as it is. They are captivated by the brilliancy of her wit, set off by her unequalled beauty, and, for a woman, her rare attainments, and hover around her as some superior being. Then for the mass of our rich and noble, her ostentatious state and imperial bearing are all that they can appreciate, all they ask for, and more than enough to enslave them, not only to her reasonable will, but to all her most tyrannical and whimsical caprices. She understands already perfectly the people she is among; and through her quick sagacity, has already risen to a power greater than woman ever before held in Rome. We see her often — often as ever — and when we see her, enjoy her as well. For with all her ambition of petty rule and imposing state, she possesses and retains a goodness of heart, that endears her to all, in spite of her follies. Julia is still her beloved Julia, and I her good friend Lucius; but it is to Zenobia that she attaches herself most closely; and from her she draws most largely of the kind of inspiration which she covets. And it is to her, I believe, that we may trace much of the admirable wisdom — for such it must be allowed to be — with which Livia adorns the throne of the world. Her residence, when Aurelian is absent from the city, is near us in the palace upon the Palatine; but when he is here, it is more remote, in the enchanted gardens of Sallust. This spot, first ennobled by the presence of the great historian, to whose hand and eye of taste the chief beauties of the scene are to be traced, then afterward selected by Vespasian as an imperial villa, is now lately become the chosen retreat of Aurelian. It has indeed lost a part of its charms since it has been embraced by the extension of the new walls within the limits of the city; but enough remain to justify abundantly the preference of a line of emperors. It is there that we see Livia most as we have been used to do, and where are forcibly brought to our minds the hours passed by us so instructively in the gardens of Zenobia. Often Aurelian is of our company, and throws the light of his strong intellect upon whatever subject it is we discuss. He cannot, however, on such occasions, thoroughly tame to the tone of gentle society, his imperious and almost rude nature. The peasant of Pannonia will sometimes break through, and usurp the place of emperor; but it is only for a moment; for it is amusing to note how the presence of Livia quickly restores him to himself; when, with more grace than one would look for, he acknowledges his fault, ascribing it sportively to the fogs of the German marshes. It amuses us to observe the power which the polished manners and courtly ways of Livia exercise over Aurelian, whose ambition seems now as violently bent upon subduing the world by the displays of taste, grace, and magnificence, as it once was to do it — and is still indeed — by force of arms. Having astonished mankind in one way, he would astonish them again in quite another; and to this later task his whole nature is consecrated with as entire a devotion as ever it was to the other. Livia is in all these things his model and guide; and never did soldier learn to catch, from the least motion or sign of the general, his will, than does he, to the same end, study the countenance and the voice of the empress. Yet is there, as you will believe, knowing the character of Aurelian as well as you do, nothing mean nor servile in this. He is ever himself, and beneath this transparent surface, artificially assumed, you behold, feature for feature, the lineaments of the fierce soldier glaring forth in all their native wildness and ferocity. Yet we are happy that there exists any charm potent enough to calm, but for hours or days, a nature so stern and cruel as to cause perpetual fears for the violences in which at any moment it may break out. The late slaughter in the very streets of Rome, when the Cœlian ran with the blood of fifteen thousand Romans, butchered within sight of their own homes, with the succeeding executions, naturally fill us with apprehensions for the future. We call him generous, and magnanimous, and so he is, compared with former tyrants who have polluted the throne — Tiberius, Commodus, or Maximin; but what title has he to that praise, when tried by the standard which our own reason supplies of those great virtues? I confess it was not always so. His severity was formerly ever on the side of justice; it was indignation at crime or baseness which sometimes brought upon him the charge of cruelty — never the wanton infliction of suffering and death. But it certainly is not so now. A slight cause now rouses his sleeping passions to a sudden fury, often fatal to the first object that comes in his way. But enough of this. Do not forget to tell me again of the Old Hermit of the mountains, and that you have visited him — if indeed he be yet among the living. Even with your lively imagination, Fausta, you can hardly form an idea of the sensation which my open assertion of Christian principles and assumption of the Christian name has made in Rome. I intended when I sat down to speak only of this, but see how I have been led away! My letters will be for the most part confined, I fear, to the subjects which engross both myself and Julia most — such as relate to the condition and prospects of the new religion, and to the part which we take in the revolution which is going on. Not that I shall be speechless upon other and inferior topics, but that upon this of Christianity I shall be garrulous and overflowing. I believe that in doing this, I shall consult your preferences as well as my own. I know you to be desirous of principles better than any which as yet you have been able to discover, and that you will gladly learn whatever I may have it in my power to teach you from this quarter. But all the teaching I shall attempt will be to narrate events as they occur, and state facts as they arise, and leave them to make what impression they may. When I just spoke of the sensation which my adoption of the Christian system had caused in Rome, I did not mean to convey any idea like this, that it has been rare for the intelligent and cultivated to attach themselves to this despised religion. On the contrary, it would be true were I to say, that they who accept Christianity, are distinguished for their intelligence; that estimated as a class, and they rank far above the lowest. It is not the dregs of a people who become reformers of philosophy or religion; who grow dissatisfied with ancient opinions upon exalted subjects, and search about for better, and adopt them. The processes involved in this change, in their very nature, require intelligence, and imply a character of more than common elevation. It is neither the lowest nor the highest who commence, and at first carry on, a work like this; but those who fill the intermediate spaces. The lowest are dead as brute matter to such interests; the highest — the rich, the fashionable, the noble — from opposite causes just as dead — or if they are alive at all, it is with the rage of denunciation and opposition. They are supporters of the decent usages sanctioned by antiquity, and consecrated by the veneration of a long line of the great and noble. Whether they themselves believe in the system which they uphold or not, they are equally tenacious of it. They would preserve and perpetuate it, because it has satisfied, at any rate bound and overawed, the multitude for ages: and the experiment of alteration or substitution is too dangerous to be tried. Most indeed reason not, nor philosophize at all, in the matter. The instinct that makes them Romans in their worship of the power and greatness at Rome, and attachment to her civil forms, makes them Romans in their religion, and will summon them, if need be, to die for the one and the other. Religion and philosophy have accordingly nothing to hope from this quarter. It is those whom we may term the substantial middle classes, who, being least hindered by prejudices and pride of order, on the one hand, and incapacitated by ignorance on the other, have ever been the earliest and best friends of progress in any science. Here you find the retired scholar, the thoughtful and independent farmer, the skillful mechanic, the enlightened merchant, the curious traveler, the inquisitive philosopher — all fitted, beyond those of either extreme, for exercising a sound judgment upon such questions, and all more interested in them. It is out of these that Christianity has made its converts. They are accordingly worthy of universal respect. I have examined with diligence, and can say that there live not in Rome a purer and more noble company than the Christians. When I say however that it is out of these whom I have just specified, that Christianity has made its converts, I do not mean to say out of them exclusively. Some have joined them in the present age, as well as in every age past, from the most elevated in rank and power. If in Nero's palace, and among his chief ministers, there were Christians, if Domitilla, Domitian's niece, was a Christian, if Philip was a Christian, so now a few of the same rank may be counted, who openly, and more who secretly, profess this religion. But they are very few. So that you will not wonder that when the head of the ancient and honorable house of the Pisos, the friend of Aurelian, and allied to the royal family of Palmyra, declared himself to be of this persuasion, no little commotion was observable in Rome — not so much among the Christians themselves as among the patricians, among the nobility, in the court and palace of Aurelian. The love of many has grown cold, and the outward tokens of respect are withheld. Brows darkened by the malignant passions of the bigot are bent upon me as I pass along the streets, and inquiries, full of scornful irony, are made after the welfare of my new friends. The emperor changes not his carriage toward me, nor I believe his feelings. I think he is too tolerant of opinion, too much a man of the world, to desire to curb and restrain the liberty of his friends in the quarter of philosophy and religion. I know indeed on the other hand, that he is religious in his way, to the extreme of superstition, but I have observed no tokens as yet of any purpose or wish to interfere with the belief or worship of others. He seems like one who, if he may indulge his own feelings in his own way, is not unwilling to concede to others the same freedom. As I was writing these last sentences, I became conscious of a voice muttering in low tones, as if discoursing with itself, and upon no very agreeable theme. I heeded it not at first, but wrote on. At length it ran thus, and I was compelled to give ear: `Patience, patience — greatest of virtues, yet hardest of practice! To wait indeed for a kingdom were something, though it were upon a bed of thorns; to suffer for the honor of truth, were more; more in itself, and more in its rewards. But patience, when a fly stings, or a fool speaks, or worse, when time is wasted and lost, is — the virtue mayhap is greater after all — but it is harder, I say, of practice — that is what I say — yet, for that very reason, greater! By Hercules! I believe it is so. So that while I wait here, my virtue of patience is greater than that of these accursed Jews. Patience then, I say, patience!' VOL. I. 4 `What in the name of all antiquity,' I exclaimed, turning round as the voice ceased, `is this flood of philosophy for? Wherein have I offended?' `Offended!' cried the other: `Nay, noble master, not offended. According to my conclusion, I owe thee thanks; for while I have stood waiting to catch thy eye and ear, my virtue has shot up like a wild vine. The soul has grown. I ought therefore rather to crave forgiveness of thee, for breaking up a study which was so profound, and doubtless so agreeable too.' `Agreeable you will certainly grant it, when I tell you I was writing to your ancient friend and pupil, the daughter of Gracchus.' `Ah, the blessings of all the gods upon her. My dreams are still of her. I loved her, Piso, as I never loved beside, either form, shadow, or substance. I used to think that I loved her as a parent loves his child — a brother his sister; but it was more than that. Aristotle is not so dear to me as she. Bear witness these tears! I would now, bent as I am, travel the Syrian deserts to see her; especially if I might hear from her mouth a chapter of the great philosopher. Never did Greek, always music, seem so like somewhat more divinely harmonious than anything of earth, as when it came through her lips. Yet, by Hercules! she played me many a mad prank! 'T would have been better for her and for letters, had I chastised her more, and loved her less. Condescend, noble Piso, to name me to her, and entreat her not to fall away from her Greek. That will be a consolation under all losses, and all sorrows.' `I will not fail to do so. And now in what is my opinion wanted?' `It is simply in the matter of these volumes, where thou wilt have them bestowed. The cases here, by their superior adorning, seem designed for the great master of all, and his disciples; and it is here I would fain order them. Would it so please thee?' `No, Solon, not there. That is designed for a very different Master and his disciples.' Solon looked at me as if unwilling to credit his ears, hoping that something would be added more honorable to the affronted philosopher and myself. But nothing coming, he said: `I penetrate — I apprehend. This, the very centre and post of honor, thou reservest for the atheistical Jews. The gods help us! I doubt I should straight resign my office. Well, well; let us hope that the increase of years will bring an increase of wisdom. We cannot look for fruit on a sapling. Youth seeks novelty. But the gods be thanked! Youth lasts not long, but is a fault daily corrected; else the world were at a bad pass. Rome is not fallen, nor the fame of the Stagyrite hurt for this. But 't is grievous to behold!' So murmuring, as he retreated to the farther part of the library, with his bundle of rolls under his arm, he again busied himself in the labors of his office. I see, Fausta, the delight that sparkles in your eye, and breaks over your countenance, as you learn that Solon, the incomparable Solon, is one of my household. No one whom I could think of, appeared so well suited to my wants as librarian, as Solon, and I can by no means convey to you an idea of the satisfaction with which he hailed my offer; and abandoning the rod and the brass tablets, betook himself to a labor which would yield him so much more leisure for the perusal of his favorite authors, and the pursuit of his favorite studies. He is already deep in the question, `whether the walls of Troy were accommodated with thirty-three or thirty-nine gates,' and also in this, `what was the method of construction adopted in the case of the wooden horse, and what was its capacity?' Of his progress in these matters, I will duly inform you. But I weary your patience. Farewell. Piso, alluding in this letter to the slaughter on the Cœlian Hill, and which happened not long before it was written, I will add here that whatever color it may have pleased Aurelian to give to that affair — as if it were occasioned by a dishonest debasement of the coin by the directors of the mint — there is now no doubt, on the part of any who are familiar with the history of that period, that the difficulty originated in a much deeper and more formidable cause, well known to Aurelian himself, but not spoken of by him, in alluding to the event. It is certain, then, that the civil war which then befel, for such it was, was in truth the breaking out of a conspiracy on the part of the nobles to displace Aurelian — `a German peasant,' as they scornfully designated him — and set one of their own order upon the throne. They had already bought over the chief manager of the public mint — a slave and favorite of Aurelian — and had engaged him in creating, to serve the purposes which they had in view, an immense issue of spurious coin. This they had used too liberally, in effecting some of the preliminary objects of their movement. It was suspected, tried, proved to be false, and traced to its authors. Before they were fully prepared, the conspirators were obliged to take to their arms, as the only way in which to save themselves from the executioner. The contest was one of the bloodiest ever known within the walls of the city. It was Aurelian, with a few legions of his army, and the people — always of his part — against the wealth and the power of the nobility, and their paid adherents. In one day, and in one battle, as it may be termed, fifteen thousand soldiers and citizens were slain in the streets of the capital. Truly does Piso say, the streets of the Cœlian ran blood. I happily was within the walls of the queen's palace at Tibur; but well do I remember the horror of the time — especially the days succeeding the battle, when the vengeance of the enraged conqueror fell upon the noblest families of Rome, and the axe of the executioner was blunted and broken with the savage work which it did. No one has written of Aurelian and his reign, who has not applauded him for the defence which he made of his throne and crown, when traitorously assailed within the very walls of the capital; but all unite also in condemning that fierce spirit of revenge, which, after the contest was over and his power secure, by confiscation, banishment, torture and death, involved in ruin so many whom a different treatment would have converted into friends. But Aurelian was by nature a tyrant; it was accident whenever he was otherwise. If affairs moved on smoothly, he was the just or magnanimous prince; if disturbed and perplexed, and his will crossed, he was the imperious and vindictive tyrant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4* LETTER II. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. You need not, dear Fausta, concern yourself on our behalf. I cannot think that your apprehensions will be realized. Rome never was more calm than now, nor apparently has there ever a better temper possessed its people. The number of those who are sufficiently enlightened to know that the mind ought not to be in bondage to man, but be held answerable to God alone for its thoughts and opinions, is becoming too great for the violences and cruelties of former ages to be again put in practice against us. And Aurelian, although stern in his nature, and superstitious beyond others, will not, I am persuaded, lend himself either to priests or people to annoy us. If no principle of humanity prevented him, nor generosity of sentiment, he would be restrained, I think, by his attachments to so many who bear the hated name. And this opinion I maintain, notwithstanding a recent act on the part of the emperor, which some construe into the expression of unfavorable sentiments toward us. I allude to the appointment of Fronto, Nigridius Fronto, to be chief priest of the temple of the Sun, which has these several years been building, and is now just completed. This man signalized himself, both under Decius and Valerian, for his bitter hatred of the Christians, and his untiring zeal in the work of their destruction. The tales which are told of his ferocious barbarity, would be incredible, did we not know so well what the hard Roman heart is capable of. It is reported of him, that he informed against his own sisters, who had embraced the Christian faith, was with those who hunted them with blood-hounds from their place of concealment, and stood by, a witness and an executioner, while they were torn limb from limb, and devoured. I doubt not the truth of the story. And from that day to this, has he made it his sole office to see that all the laws that bear hard upon the sect and deprive them of privileges and immunities, are not permitted to become a dead letter. It is this man, drunk with blood, whom Aurelian has put in chief authority in his new temple, and made him, in effect, the head of religion in the city. He is however not only this. He possesses other traits, which with reason might commend him to the regard of the emperor. He is an accomplished man, of an ancient family, and withal no mean scholar. He is a Roman, who for Rome's honor or greatness, as he would on the one hand sacrifice father, mother, daughter, so would he also himself. And Rome, he believes, lives but in her religion; it is the life-blood of the state. It is these traits, I doubt not, that have recommended him to Aurelian, rather than the others. He is a person eminently fitted for the post to which he is exalted; and you well know that it is the circumstance of fitness, Aurelian alone considers, in appointing his own or the servants of the state. Probus thinks differently. And although he sees no cause to apprehend immediate violence, confesses his fears for the future. He places less reliance than I do upon the generosity or friendship of Aurelian. It is his conviction that superstition is the reigning power of his nature, and will sooner or later assert its supremacy. It may be so. Probus is an acute observer, and occupies a position more favorable to impartial estimates, and the formation of a dispassionate judgment, than I. This reminds me that you asked for news of Probus, my `Christian pedagogue,' as you are wont to name him. He is here, adorning, by a life of severe simplicity and divine benevolence, the doctrine he has espoused. He is a frequent inmate of our house, and Julia, not less than myself, ever greets him with affectionate reverence, as both friend and instructer. He holds the chief place in the hearts of the Roman Christians; for even those of the sect who differ from him in doctrine and in life, cannot but acknowledge that never an apostle presented to the love and imitation of his followers an example of rarer virtue. Yet he is not, in the outward rank which he holds, at the head of the Christian body. Their chiefs are, as you know, the bishops, and Felix is Bishop of Rome, a man every way inferior to Probus. But he has the good or ill fortune to represent more popular opinions, in matters both of doctrine and practice, than the other, and of course easily rides into the posts of trust and honor. He represents those among the Christians — for, alas! there are such among them — who, in seeking the elevation and extension of Christianity, do not hesitate to accommodate both doctrine and manner to the prejudices and tastes of both Pagan and Jew. They seek converts, not by raising them to the height of Christian principle and virtue, but by lowering these to the level of their grosser conceptions. Thus it is easy to see that in the hands of such professors, the Christian doctrine is undergoing a rapid process of deterioration. Probus, and those who are on his part, see this, are alarmed, and oppose it; but numbers are against them, and consequently power and authority. Already, strange as it may seem, when you compare such things with the institution of Christianity, as effected by its founder, do the bishops, both in Rome and in the provinces, begin to assume the state and bearing of nobility. Such is the number and wealth of the Christian community, that the treasuries of the churches are full; and from this source the pride and ambition of their rulers are luxuriously fed. If, as you walk through the street which crosses from the Quirinal to the Arch of Titus, lined with private dwellings of unusual magnificence, you ask whose is that with a portico, that for beauty and costliness rather exceeds the rest, you are told, `That is the dwelling of Felix, the Bishop of Rome;' and if it chance to be a Christian who answers the question, it is done with ill-suppressed pride or shame, according to the party to which he belongs. This Felix is the very man, through the easiness of his dispositions, and his proneness to all the arts of self-indulgence, and the imposing graciousness of his carriage, to keep the favor of the people, and at the same time sink them, without suspicion on their part, lower and lower toward the sensual superstitions, from which, through so much suffering and by so many labors, they have but just escaped, and accomplish an adulterous and fatal union between Christianity and Paganism; by which indeed Paganism may be to some extent purified and exalted, but Christianity annihilated. For Christianity, in its essence, is that which beckons and urges onward, not to excellence only, but to perfection. Of course its mark is always in advance of the present. By such union with Paganism then, or Judaism, its essential characteristic will disappear; Christianity will, in effect, perish. You may suppose, accordingly, that Probus, and others who with him rate Christianity so differently, look on with anxiety upon this downward progress, and with mingled sorrow and indignation upon those who aid it — oftentimes actuated, as is notorious, by most corrupt motives. I am just returned from the shop of the learned Publius, where I met Probus, and others of many ways of thinking. You will gather from what occurred, better than from anything else I could say, what occupies the thoughts of our citizens, and how they stand affected. I called to Milo to accompany me, and to take with him a basket in which to bring back books, which it was my intention to purchase. `I trust, noble master,' said he, `that I am to bear back no more Christian books.' `Why so, knave?' `Because the priests say that they have magical powers over all who read them, or so much as handle them; that a curse sticks wherever they are or have been. I have heard of those who have withered away to a mere wisp; of others who have suddenly caught on fire, and vanished in flame and smoke; and of others whose blood has stood still, frozen, or run out from all parts of the body, changed to the very color of your shoe, at their bare touch. Who should doubt that it is so, when the very boys in the streets have it, and it is taught in the temples? I would rather Solon, noble master, went in my stead. Mayhap his learning would protect him.' I, laughing, bade him come on. `You are not withered away yet, Milo, nor has your blood run out; yet you have borne many a package of these horrible books. Surely the gods befriend you.' `I were else long since with the Scipios.' After a pause of some length, he added, as he reluctantly, and with features of increased paleness, followed in my steps: `I would, my master, that you might be wrought with to leave these ways. I sleep not, for thinking of your danger. Never, when it was my sad mischance to depart from the deserted palace of the great Gallienus, did I look to know one to esteem like him. But it is the truth when I affirm, that I place Piso before Gallienus, and the lady Julia before the lady Salonina. Shall I tell you a secret?' `I will hear it, if it is not to be kept.' `It is for you to do with it as shall please you. I am the bosom friend, you may know, of Curio, the favorite slave of Fronto —' `Must I not publish it?' `Nay, that is not the matter, though it is somewhat to boast of. There is not Curio's fellow in all Rome. But that may pass. Curio then, as I was with him at the new temple, while he was busied in some of the last offices before the dedication, among other things, said: `Is not thy master Piso of these Christians?' `Yes,' said I, `he is; and were they all such as he, there could be no truth in what is said of them.' `Ah!' he replied, `there are few among the accursed tribe like him. He has but just joined them; that 's the reason he is better than the rest. Wait awhile, and see what he will become. They are all alike in the end, cursers, and despisers, and disbelievers, of the blessed gods. But lions have teeth, tigers have claws, knives cut, fire burns, water drowns.' There he stopped. `That's wise,' I said; `who could have known it?' `Think you,' he rejoined, `Piso knows it? If not, let him ask Fronto. Let me advise thee,' he added, in a whisper, though in all the temple there were none beside us, `let me advise thee, as thy friend, to avoid dangerous company. Look to thyself; the Christians are not safe.' `How say you,' I replied, `not safe? What and whom are they to fear? Gallienus vexed them not. Is Aurelian —' `Say no more,' he replied, interrupting me, `and name not what I have dropped, for your life. Fronto's ears are more than the eyes of Argus, and his wrath more deadly than the grave.' `Just as he ended these words, a strong beam of red light shot up from the altar, and threw a horrid glare over the whole dark interior. I confess I cried out with affright. Curio started at first, but quickly recovered, saying that it was but the sudden flaming up of the fire that had been burning on the altar, but which shortly before he had quenched. `It is,' he said, `an omen of the flames that are to be kindled throughout Rome.' This was Curio's communication. Is is not a secret worth knowing?' `It tells nothing, Milo, but of the boiling over of the wrath of the malignant Fronto, which is always boiling over. Doubtless I should fare ill, were his power equal to his will to harm us. But Aurelian is above him.' `That is true; and Aurelian, it is plain, is little like Fronto.' `Very little.' `But still I would that, like Gallienus, thou couldst only believe in the gods. The Christians, so it is reported, worship and believe in but a man, — a Jew, — who was crucified as a criminal, with thieves and murderers.' He turned upon me a countenance full of unaffected horror. `Well, Milo, at another time I will tell you what the truth about it is. Here we are now, at the shop of Publius.' The shop of Publius is remarkable for its extent and magnificence, if such a word may be applied to a place of traffic. Here resort all the idlers of learning and of leisure, to turn over the books, hear the news, discuss the times, and trifle with the learned bibliopole. As I entered, he saluted me in his customary manner, and bade me `welcome to his poor apartments, which for a long time I had not honored with my presence.' I replied that two things had kept me away: the civil broils in which the city had just been involved, and the care of ordering the appointments of a new dwelling. I had come now to commence some considerable purchases for my vacant shelves, if it might so happen that the books I wanted were to be found in his rooms. `There is not,' he replied, `a literature, a science, a philosophy, an art, or a religion, whose principal authors are not to be found upon the walls of Publius. My VOL. I. 5 agents are in every corner of the empire, of the east and west, searching out the curious and the rare, the useful and the necessary, to swell the catalogue of my intellectual riches. I believe it is established, that in no time before me, as nowhere now, has there been heard of a private collection like this for value and for number.' `I do not doubt what you say, Publius. This is a grand display. Your ranges of rooms show like those of the Ulpian. Yet you do not quite equal, I suppose, Trajan's for number?' `Truly not. But time may bring it to pass. What shall I show you? It pleases me to give my time to you. I am not slow to guess what it is you now, noble Piso, chiefly covet. And I think, if you will follow me to the proper apartment, I can set before you the very things you are in search of. Here upon these shelves are the Christian writers. Just let me offer you this copy of Hegesippus, one of your oldest historians, if I err not. And here are some beautifully executed copies, I have just ordered to be made, of the Apologies of Justin and Tertullian. Here, again, are Marcion and Valentinus; but perhaps they are not in esteem with you. If I have heard aright, you will prefer these tracts of Paul, or Artemon. But hold, here is a catalogue. Be pleased to inspect it.' As I looked over the catalogue, I expressed my satisfaction that a person of his repute was willing to keep on sale works so generally condemned, and excluded from the shops of most of his craft. `I aim, my dear friend — most worthy Piso — to steer a midway course among contending factions. I am myself a worshipper of the gods of my fathers. But I am content that others should do as they please in the matter. I am not, however, so much a worshipper — in your ear — as a bookseller. That is my calling. The Christians are become a most respectable people. They are not to be overlooked. They are in my judgment, the most intelligent part of our community. Wasting none of their time at the baths and theatres, they have more time for books. And then their numbers too! They are not fewer than seventy thousand! — known and counted. But the number, between ourselves, Piso, of those who secretly favor or receive this doctrine, is equal to the other! My books go to houses, ay, and to palaces, people dream not of.' `I think your statements a little broad,' said a smooth, silvery voice, close at our ears. We started, and beheld the Prefect Varus standing at our side. Publius was for a moment a little disconcerted; but quickly recovered, saying, in his easy way, `A fair morning to you! I knew not that it behooved me to be upon my oath, being in the presence of the Governor of Rome. I repeat, noble Varus, but what I hear. I give what I say as the current rumor. That is all — that is all. Things may not be so, or they may; it is not for me to say. I wish well to all; that is my creed.' `In the public enumerations of the citizens,' replied the Prefect, inclining with civility to Publius, `the Christians have reached at no time fifty thousand. As for the conjecture touching the numbers who secretly embrace this injurious superstition, I hold it utterly baseless. It may serve a dying cause to repeat such statements, but they accord not with obvious fact.' `Suspect me not, Varus,' hastily rejoined the agitated Publius, `of setting forth such statements with the purpose to advance the cause of the Christians. I take no part in this matter. Thou knowest that I am a Roman of the old stamp. Not a Roman in my street is more diligently attentive to the services of the temple than I. I simply say again, what I hear as news of my customers. The story which one rehearses, I retail to another.' `I thank the gods it is so,' replied the man of power. During these few words, I had stood partly concealed by a slender marble pillar. I now turned, and the usual greetings passed with the Prefect. `Ah! Piso! I knew not with certainty my hearer. Perhaps from you' — smiling as he spoke — `we may learn the truth. Rome speaks loudly of your late desertion of the religion and worship of your fathers, and union with the Galileans. I should say, I hoped the report ill founded, had I not heard it from quarters too authentic to permit a doubt.' `You have heard rightly, Varus,' I rejoined. `After searching through all antiquity after truth, I congratulate myself upon having at last discovered it, and where I least expected, in a Jew. And the good which I have found for myself. I am glad to know is enjoyed by so many more of my fellow-citizens. I should not hesitate to confirm the statement made by Publius, from whatever authority he may have derived it, rather than that which has been made by yourself. I have bestowed attention not only upon the arguments which support Christianity, but upon the actual condition of the Christian community, here and throughout the empire. It is prosperous at this hour, beyond all former example. If Pliny could complain, even in his day, of the desertion of the temples of the gods, what may we now suppose to be the relative numbers of the two great parties? Only, Varus, allow the rescript of Gallienus to continue in force, which merely releases us from oppressions, and we shall see in what a fair trial of strength between the two religions will issue. `That dull profligate and parricide,' replied Varus, `not content with killing himself with his vices, and his father by connivance, must needs destroy his country by his fatuity. I confess, that till that order be repealed, the superstition will spread.' `But it only places us upon equal ground.' `It is precisely there where we never should be placed. Should the conspirator be put upon the ground of a citizen? Were the late rebels of the mint to be relieved from all oppression, that they might safely intrigue and conspire for the throne?' `Christianity has nothing to do with the empire, as such. It is a question of moral, philosophical, religious truth. Is truth to be exalted or suppressed by edicts?' `The religion of the state,' replied Varus, `is a part of the state; and he who assails it, strikes at the dearest life of the state, and — forgive me — is to be dealt with — ought to be dealt with — as a traitor.' `I trust,' I replied, `that that time will never again come, but that reason and justice will continue to bear sway. And it is both reasonable and just, that persons who yield to none in love of country, and whose principles of conduct are such as must make good subjects VOL. I. 5* everywhere, because they first make good men, should be protected in the enjoyment of rights and privileges common to all others.' `If the Christians,' he rejoined, `are virtuous men, it is better for the state than if they were Christians and corrupt men. But still that would make no change in my judgment of their offence. They deny the gods who preside over this nation, and have brought it up to its present height of power and fame. Their crime were less, I repeat, to deny the authority of Aurelian. This religion of the Galileans is a sore, eating into the vitals of an ancient and vigorous constitution, and must be cut away. The knife of the surgeon is what the evil cries out for and must have — else universal anarchy is come. I mourn that from the ranks of the very fathers of the state, they have received an accession like this of the house of Piso.' `I shall think my time and talent well employed,' I replied, `in doing what I may to set the question of Christianity in its true light before the city. It is this very institution, Varus, which it needs to preserve it. Christianize Rome, and you impart the very principle of endurance, of immortality. Under its present corruptions, it cannot but sink. Is it possible a community of men can long hold together as vicious as this of Rome? — whose people are either disbelievers of all divine existences, or else ground to the earth by degrading superstitions? A nation, either on the one hand governed by superstition, or on the other, atheistical, contains within itself the disease which sooner or later will destroy it. You yourself, it is notorious, have never been within the walls of a temple, nor are Lares nor Penates to be found within your doors.' `I deny it not. Most who rise to any intelligence must renounce, if they ever harbored it, all faith in the absurdities and nonsense of the Roman religion. But what then? These very absurdities, as we deem them, are holy truth to the multitude, and do more than all bolts, bars, axes, and gibbets, to keep them in subjection. The intelligent are good citizens by reflection; the multitude, through instincts of birth, and the power of superstition. My idea is, as you perceive, Piso, but one. Religion is the state, and for reasons of state must be preserved in the very form in which it has so long upheld the empire.' `An idea more degrading than yours, to our species, can hardly be conceived. I cannot but look upon man as something more than a part of the state. He is, first of all, a man, and is to be cared for as such. To legislate for the state, to the ruin of the man, is to pamper the body, and kill the soul. It is to invert the true process. The individual is more than the abstraction which we term the state. If governments cannot exist, nor empires hold their sway, but by the destruction of the human being, why let them fall. The lesser must yield to the greater. As a Christian, my concern is for man as man. This is the essence of the religion of Christ. It is philanthropy. It sees in every human soul a being of more value than empires, and its purpose is, by furnishing it with truths and motives, equal to its wants, to exalt it, purify it, and perfect it. If, in achieving this work, existing religions or governments are necessarily overturned or annihilated, Christianity cares not, so long as man is the gainer. And is it not certain, that no government could really be injured, although it might apparently, and for a season, by its subjects being raised in all intelligence and all virtue? My work therefore, Varus, will be to sow truth in the heart of the people, which shall make that heart fertile and productive. I do not believe that in doing this Rome will suffer injury, but on the contrary receive benefit. Its religion, or rather its degrading superstitions, may fall, but a principle of almighty energy and divine purity will insensibly be substituted in their room. I labor for man — not for the state.' `And never, accordingly, most noble Piso, did man, in so unequivocal words, denounce himself traitor.' `Patriot! friend! benefactor! rather;' cried a voice at my side, which I instantly recognized as that of Probus. Several beside himself had drawn near, listening with interest to what was going on. `That only shows, my good friend,' said Varus, in his smiling way, and which seems the very contradiction of all that is harsh and cruel, `how differently we estimate things. Your palate esteems that to be wholesome and nutritious food, which mine rejects as ashes to the taste, and poison to the blood. I behold Rome torn and bleeding, prostrate and dying, by reason of innovations upon faith and manners, which to you appear the very means of growth, strength, and life. How shall we resolve the doubt? Who shall prescribe for the patient? I am happy in the belief, that the Roman people have long since decided for themselves, and confirm their decision every day as it passes, by new acts and declarations.' `If you mean,' said Probus, `to say that numbers and the general voice are still against the Christians, I grant it so. But I am happy too in my belief, that the scale is trembling on the beam. There are more and better than you wot of, who hail with eager minds and glad hearts, the truths which it is our glory, as servants of Christ, to propound. Within many a palace upon the seven hills, do prayers go up in his name; and what is more, thousands upon thousands of the humbler ranks, of those who but yesterday were without honor in their own eyes, or others' — without faith — at war with themselves and the world — fit tools for any foe of the state to work with — are to-day reverers of themselves, worshippers of God, lovers of mankind, patriots who love their country better than ever before, because they now behold in every citizen not only a citizen, but a brother and an immortal. The doctrine of Christianity, as a lover of man, so commends itself, Varus, to the hearts of the people, that in a few more years of prosperity, and the face of the Roman world will glow with a new beauty; love and humanity will shine forth in all its features.' `That is very pretty,' said Varus, his lip slightly curling, as he spoke, but retaining his courteous bearing, `yet methinks, seeing this doctrine is so bewitching, and is withal a heaven-inspired wisdom, the God working behind it and urging it on, it moves onward with a pace something of the slowest. Within a few of three hundred years has it appealed to the human race, and appealed in vain. The feeblest and the worst of mankind have had power almost to annihilate it, and more than once has it seemed scarce to retain its life. Would it have been so, had it been in reality what you claim for it, of divine birth? Would the gods suffer their schemes for man's good to be so thwarted, and driven aside by man? What was this boasted faith doing during the long and peaceful reigns of Hadrian, and the first Antonine? The sword of persecution was then sheathed, or if it fell at all, it was but on a few. So too under Vespasian, Titus, Nerva, Commodus, Severus, Heliogabalus, the Philips, Gallienus, and Claudius?' `That is well said,' a Roman voice added, of one standing by the side of Varus, `and is a general wonder.' `I marvel it should be a wonder,' rejoined Probus. `Can you pour into a full measure? Must it not be first emptied? Who, Varus, let him try as he may, could plant the doctrine of Christ in thy heart? Could I do it, think you? — or Piso?' `I trow not.' `And why, I pray you?' `It is not hard to guess.' `Is it not because you are already full of contrary notions, to which you cling tenaciously, and from which, perhaps, no human force could drag you? But yours is a type of every other Roman mind to which Christianity has been offered. If you receive it not at once, should others? Suppose the soul to be full of sincere convictions as to the popular faith, can the gospel easily enter there? Suppose it skeptical, as to all spiritual truth; can it enter there? Suppose it polluted by vice; can it easily enter there? Suppose it like the soul of Fronto, — ' `Hush! hush!' said several voices. Probus heeded them not. `Suppose it like the soul of Fronto, could it enter there? See you not then, by knowing your own hearts, what time it must demand for a new, and specially a strict doctrine to make its way into the minds of men? 'T is not easier to bore a rock with one's finger, than to penetrate a heart hardened by sin or swelled with prejudice and pride. And if we say, Varus, this was a work for the God to do — that he who originated the faith should propagate it — I answer, that would not be like the other dealings of the divine power. He furnishes you with earth and seed, but he ploughs not for you, nor plants, nor reaps. He gives you reason, but he pours not knowledge into your mind. So he offers truth; but that is all. He compels no assent; he forces no belief. All is voluntary and free. How then can the march of truth be otherwise than slow? Truth, being the greatest thing below, resembles in its port the motion of the stars, which are the greatest things above. But like theirs, if slow, it is ever sure and onward.' `The stars set in night.' `But they rise again. Truth is eclipsed often, and it sets for a night; but never is turned aside from its eternal path.' `Never, Publius,' said the Prefect, adjusting his gown, and with the act filling the air with perfume, `never did I think to find myself within a Christian church. Your shop possesses many virtues. It is a place to be instructed in.' Then turning to Probus, he soothingly and in persuasive tones, added, `Be advised now, good friend, and leave off thy office of teacher. Rome can well spare thee. Take the judgment of others; we need not thy doctrine. Let that alone which is well established and secure. Spare these institutions, veneerable through a thousand years. Leave changes to the gods.' Probus was about to reply, when we were strangely interrupted. While we had been conversing, there stood before me, in the midst of the floor of the apartment, a man, whose figure, face, and demeanor were such that I hardly could withdraw my eye from him. He was tall and gaunt, beyond all I ever saw, and erect as a Prætorian in the ranks. His face was strongly Roman, thin and bony, with sunken cheeks, a brown and wrinkled skin — not through age, but exposure — and eyes more wild and fiery than ever glared in the head of Hun or hyena. He seemed a living fire-brand of death and ruin. As we talked, he stood there motionless, sometimes casting glances at our group, but more frequently fixing them upon a roll which he held in his hands. As Varus uttered the last words, this man suddenly left his post, and reaching us with two or three strides, shook his long finger at Varus, saying, at the same time, `Hold, blasphemer!' The Prefect started as if struck, and gazing a moment with unfeigned amazement at the figure, then immediately burst into a laugh, crying out, `Ha! ha! Who in the name of Hecate have we here? Ha! ha! — he seems just escaped from the Vivaria.' `Thy laugh,' said the figure `is the music of a sick and dying soul. It is a rebel's insult against the majesty of Heaven; ay, laugh on! That is what the devils do; it is the merriment of hell. What time they burn not, they laugh. But enough. Hold now thy scoffing, Prefect Varus, for high as thou art, I fear thee not: no! not wert thou twice Aurelian, instead of Varus. I have somewhat for thee. Wilt hear it?' `With delight, Bubo. Say on.' `It was thy word just now, `Rome needs not this doctrine,' was it not?' `If I said it not, it is a good saying, and I will father it.' “Rome needs not this doctrine; she is well enough; let her alone!' These were thy words. Need not, Varus, the streets of Rome a cleansing river to purify them? Dost thou think them well enough, till all the fountains have been let loose to purge them? Is Tarquin's sewer a place to dwell in? Could all the waters of Rome sweeten it? The people of Rome are fouler than her highways. The sewers are sweeter than the very worshippers of our temples. Thou knowest somewhat of this. Wast ever present at the rites of Bacchus? — or those of the Cyprian goddess? Nay, blush not yet. Didst ever hear of the gladiator Pollex? — of the woman Cæcina? — of the boy Lælius, and the fair girl Fannia — proffered and sold by the parents, Pollex and Cæcina, to the loose pleasures of Gallienus? Now I give thee leave to blush! Is it nought that the one half of Rome is sunk in a sensuality, a beastly drunkenness and lust, fouler than that of old, which, in Judea, called down the fiery vengeance of the insulted heavens? VOL. I. 6 Thou knowest well, both from early experience and because of thy office, what the purlieus of the theatres are, and places worse than those, and which to name were an offence. But to you they need not be named. Is all this, Varus, well enough? Is this that venerable order thou wouldst not have disturbed? Is that to be charged as impiety and atheism, which aims to change and reform it? Are they conspirators, and rebels, and traitors, whose sole office and labor is to mend these degenerate morals, to heal these corrupting sores, to pour a better life into the rotting carcass of this guilty city? Is it for our pastime, or our profit, that we go about this always dangerous work? Is it a pleasure to hear the gibes, jests, and jeers of the streets and the places of public resort? Will you not believe that it is for some great end, that we do and bear as thou seest — even the redemption, and purifying, and saving of Rome? I love Rome, even as a mother, and for her am ready to die. I have bled for her freely in battle, in Gaul, upon the Danube, in Asia, and in Egypt. I am willing to bleed for her at home, even unto death, if that blood might, through the blessing of God, be a stream to cleanse her putrifying members. But O, holy Jesus! why waste I words upon one whose heart is harder than the nether millstone! Thou preachedst not to Pilate, nor didst thou work thy wonders for Herod. Varus, beware!' And with these words, uttered with a wild and threatening air, he abruptly turned away, and was lost in the crowds of the street. While he raved, the Prefect maintained the same unruffled demeanor as before. His customary smile played around his mouth, a smile like no other I ever saw. To a casual observer, it would seem like every other smile, but to one who watches him, it is evident that it denotes no hilarity of heart, for the eyes accompany it not with a corresponding expression, but on the contrary, look forth from their beautiful cavities with glances that speak of anything rather than of peace and good-will. So soon as the strange being who had been declaiming had disappeared, the Prefect, turning to me, as he drew up his gown around him, said, `I give you joy, Piso, of your coadjutor. A few more of the same fashion, and Rome is safe.' And saluting us with urbanity, he sallied from the shop. I had been too much amazed, myself, during this scene, to do anything else than stand still, and listen, and observe. As for Probus, I saw him to be greatly moved, and give signs of even deep distress. He evidently knew who the person was — as I saw him make more than one ineffectual effort to arrest him in his harangue — and as evidently held him in respect, seeing he abstained from all interruption of a speech that he felt to be provoking wantonly the passions of the Prefect, and of many who stood around, from whom, so soon as the man of authority had withdrawn, angry words broke forth abundantly. `Well did the noble Prefect say, that that wild animal had come forth like a half-famished tiger from the Vivaria,' said one. `It is singular,' observed another, `that a man who pretends to reform the state, should think to do it by first putting it into a rage with him, and all he utters.' `Especially singular,' added a third, `that the advocate of a religion that, as I hear, condemns violence, and consists in the strictness with which the passions are governed, should suppose that he was doing any other work than entering a breach in his own citadel, by such ferocity. But it is quite possible his wits are touched.' `No, I presume not,' said the first; `this is a kind of zeal which, if I have observed aright, the Christians hold in esteem.' As these separated to distant parts of the shop, I said to Probus, who seemed heavily oppressed by what had occurred, `What dæmon dwells in that body that has just departed?' `Well do you say dæmon. The better mind of that man seems oft-times seized upon by some foul spirit, and bound — and which then acts and speaks in its room. But do you not know him?' `No, truly; he is a stranger to me, as he appears to be to all.' `Nevertheless, you have been in his company. You forget not the Mediterranean voyage?' `By no means. I enjoyed it highly, and recall it ever with delight.' `Do you not remember, at the time I narrated to you the brief story of my life, that, as I ended, a rough voice from among the soldiers exclaimed, `Where now are the gods of Rome?' This is that man, the soldier Macer; then bound with fellow soldiers to the service in Africa, now a Christian preacher.' `I see it now. That man impressed me then with his thin form and all-devouring eyes. But the African climate, and the gash across his left cheek, and which seems to have slightly disturbed the eye upon that side, have made him a different being, and almost a terrific one. Is he sound and sane?' `Perfectly so,' replied Probus, `unless we may say that souls earnestly devoted and zealous, are mad. There is not a more righteous soul in Rome. His conscience is bare, and shrinking like a fresh wound. His breast is warm and fond as a woman's. His penitence for the wild errors of his pagan youth, a consuming fire, which, while it redoubles his ardor in doing what he may in the cause of truth, rages in secret, and, if the sword or the cross claim him not, will bring him to the grave. He is utterly incapable of fear. All the racks and dungeons of Rome, with their tormentors, could not terrify him.' `You now interest me in him. I must see and know him. It might be of service to him and to all, Probus, methinks, if he could be brought to associate with those whose juster notions might influence his, and modify them to the rule of truth.' `I fear not. What he sees, he sees clearly and strongly, and by itself. He understands nothing of one truth bearing upon another, and adding to it, or taking from it. Truth is truth with him — and as his own mind perceives it — not another's. His conscience will allow him in no accommodations to other men's opinions or wishes. He is impatient under an argument as a warhorse under the rein after the trumpet sounds. It is unavoidable therefore but he should possess great power among the Christians of Rome. His are the bold and decisive qualities that strike the common mind. There is glory and applause in following and enduring under VOL. I. 6* such a leader. Many are fain to believe him divinely illuminated and impelled, to unite the characters of teacher and prophet; and from knowing that he is so regarded by others, Macer has come almost to believe it himself. He is tending more and more to construe every impulse of his own mind into a divine suggestion, and I believe honestly experiences difficulty in discriminating between them. Still, I do not deny that it would be of advantage for him more and more to come in contact with sober and enlightened minds. I shall take pleasure, at some fitting moment, to accompany you to his humble dwelling; the rather as I would show you also his wife and children, all of whom are like himself Christians.' `I shall not forget the promise.' Whereupon we separated. I then searched for Publius, and making my purchases, returned home, Milo following with the books. As Milo relieved himself of his burden, discharging it upon the floor of the library, I overheard him to say, `Lie there, accursed rolls! May the flames consume you, ere you are again upon my shoulders! For none but Piso would I have done what I have. Let me to the temple and expiate.' `What words are these?' cried Solon, emerging suddenly at the sound from a recess. `Who dares to heap curses upon books, which are the soul embalmed and made imperishable? What have we here? Aha! a new treasure for these vacant shelves, and most trimly ordered.' `These, venerable Greek,' exclaimed Milo, waving him away, `are books of magic! oriental magic! Have a care! A touch may be fatal! Our noble master affects the Egyptians.' `Magic!' exclaimed Solon, with supreme contempt; `art thou so idiotic as to put credence in such fancies? Away! — hinder me not!' And saying so, he eagerly grasped a volume, and unrolling it, to the beginning of the work, dropped it suddenly, as if bitten by a serpent. `Ha!' cried Milo, `said I not so? Art thou so idiotic, learned Solon, as to believe in such fancies? How is it with thee? Is thy blood hot or cold? — thy teeth loose or fast? — thy arm withered or swollen?' Solon stood surveying the pile, with a look partly of anger, partly of sorrow. `Neither, fool!' he replied. `These possess not the power nor worth fabled of magic. They are books of dreams, visions, reveries, which are to the mind what fogs would be for food, and air for drink, innutritive and vain. Papias! — Irenæus! — Hegesippus! — Polycarp! Origen — whose names are these, and to whom familiar? Some are Greek, some are Latin, but not a name famous in the world meets my eye. But we will order them on their shelves, and trust that time, which accomplishes all things, will restore reason to Piso. Milo, essay thy strength — my limbs are feeble — and lift these upon yonder marble; so may age deal gently with thee.' `Not for their weight in wisdom, Solon, would I again touch them. I have borne them hither, and if the priests speak truly, my life is worth not an obolus. I were mad to tempt my fate farther.' `Avaunt thee, then, for a fool and a slave, as thou art!' `Nay now, master Solon, thy own wisdom forsakes thee. Philosophers, they say, are ever possessors of themselves, though for the rest they be beggars.' `Beggar! sayest thou? Avaunt! I say, or Papias shall teach thee' — and he would have launched the roll at the head of Milo, but that, with quick instincts, he shot from the apartment, and left the pedagogue to do his own bidding. So Fausta, you see that Solon is still the irritable old man he was, and Milo the fool he was. Think not me worse than either, for hoping so to entertain you. I know that in your solitude and grief, even such pictures may be welcome. When I related to Julia the scene and the conversation at the shop of Publius, she listened not without agitation, and expresses her fears lest such extravagances, repeated and become common, should inflame the minds both of the people and their rulers against the Christians. Though I agree with her in lamenting the excess of zeal displayed by many of the Christians, and their needless assaults upon the characters and faith of their opposers, I cannot apprehend serious consequences from them, because they are so few and rare, and are palpable exceptions to the general character which I believe the whole city would unite in ascribing to the Christians. Their mildness and pacific temper are perhaps the very traits by which they are most distinguished, with which they are indeed continually reproached. Yet individual acts are often the remote causes of vast universal evil — of bloodshed, war, and revolution. Macer alone is enough to set on fire a city, a continent, a world. I rejoice, I cannot tell you how sincerely, in all your progress. I do not doubt in the ultimate return of the city to its former populousness and wealth, at least. Aurelian has done well for you at last. His disbursements for the Temple of the Sun alone are vast, and must be more than equal to its perfect restoration. Yet his overthrown column you will scarce be tempted to rebuild. Forget not to assure Gracchus and Calpurnius of my affection. Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER III. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. You are right, Fausta, in your unfavorable judgment of the Roman populace. The Romans are not a people one would select to whom to propose a religion like this of Christianity. All causes seem to combine to injure and corrupt them. They are too rich. The wealth of subject kingdoms and provinces finds its way to Rome; and not only in the form of tribute to the treasury of the empire, but in that of the private fortunes amassed by such as have held offices in them for a few years, and who then return to the capital to dissipate in extravagances and luxuries, unknown to other parts of the world, the riches wrung by violence, injustice and avarice from the wretched inhabitants whom fortune had delivered into their power. Yes, the wealth of Rome is accumulated in such masses, not through the channels of industry nor commerce; it arrives in bales and ship-loads, drained from foreign lands by the hand of extortion. The palaces are not to be numbered, built and adorned in a manner surpassing those of the monarchs of other nations, which are the private residences of those, or of the descendants of those who for a few years have presided over some distant province, but in that brief time, Verres-like, have used their opportunities so well as to return home oppressed with a wealth which life proves not long enough to spend, notwithstanding the aid of dissolute and spendthrift sons. Here have we a single source of evil equal to the ruin of any people. The morals of no community could be protected against such odds. It is a mountain torrent tearing its way through the fields of the husbandman, whose trees and plants possess no strength of branch or root to resist the inundation. Then in addition to all this, there are the largesses of the emperor, not only to his armies, but to all the citizens of Rome; which are now so much a matter of expectation, that rebellions I believe would ensue were they not bestowed. Aurelian, before his expedition to Asia, promised to every citizen a couple of crowns — he has redeemed the promise by the distribution, not of money but of bread, two loaves to each, with the figure of a crown stamped upon them. Besides this, there has been an allowance of meat and pork — so much to all the lower orders. He even contemplated the addition of wine to the list, but was hindered by the judicious suggestion of his friend and general, Mucapor, that if he provided wine and pork he would next be obliged to furnish them fowls also, or public tumults might break out. This recalled him to his senses. Still however only in part, for the other grants have not been withdrawn. In this manner is this whole population supported in idleness. Labor is confined to the slaves. The poor feed upon the bounties of the emperor, and the wealth so abundantly lavished by senators, nobles, and the retired proconsuls. Their sole employment is, to wait upon the pleasure of their many masters, serve them as they are ready enough to do, in the toils and preparations of luxury, and what time they are not thus occupied, pass the remainder of their hours at the theatres, at the circuses, at games of a thousand kinds, or in noisy groups at the corners of the streets and in the market-places. It is become a state necessity to provide amusements for the populace, in order to be safe against their violence. The theatres, the baths, with their ample provisions for passing away time in some indolent amusement or active game, are always open and always crowded. Public or funeral games are also in progress without intermission in different parts of the capital. Those instituted in honor of the gods, and which make a part of the very religion of the people, are seldom suspended for even a day. At one temple or another, in this grove or that, within or without the walls, are these lovers of pleasure entertained by shows, processions, music, and sacrifices. And as if these were not enough, or when they perchance fail for a moment, and the sovereign people are listless and dull, the Flavian is thrown open by the imperial command, the Vivaria vomit forth their maddened and howling tenants either to destroy each other, or dye the dust of the arena with the blood of gladiators, criminals or captives. These are the great days of the Roman people; these their favorite pleasures. The cry through the streets in the morning of even women and boys, “Fifty captives to-day for the lions in the Flavian,” together with the more solemn announcement of the same by the public heralds, and by painted bills at the corners of the streets, and on the public baths, is sure to throw the city into a fever of excitement, and rivet by a new bond the affections of this bloody people to their indulgent emperor. Hardly has the floor of the amphitheatre been renewed since the cessation of the triumphal games of Aurelian, before it is again to be soaked with blood in honor of Apollo, whose magnificent temple is within a few days to be dedicated. Never before I believe was there a city whose inhabitants so many and so powerful causes conspired to corrupt and morally destroy. Were I to give you a picture of the vices of Rome, it would be too dark and foul a one for your eye to read, but not darker nor fouler than you will suppose it must necessarily be to agree with what I have already said. Where there is so little industry and so much pleasure, the vices will flourish and shoot up to their most gigantic growth. Not in the days of Nero were they more luxuriant than now. Aurelian, in the first year of his reign, laid upon them a severe but useful restraint, and they were checked for a time. But since he has himself departed from the simplicity and rigor of that early day, and actually or virtually repealed the laws which then were promulged for the reformation of the city in its manners, the people have also relapsed, and the ancient excesses are renewed. This certainly is not a people who, in its whole mass, will be eager to receive the truths of a religion like this of Christianity. It will be repulsive to them. You are right in believing that among the greater part it will find no favor. But all are not such as I have described. There are others different in all respects, and who stand waiting the appearance of some principles of philosophy or religion which shall be powerful enough to redeem their country from idolatry and moral death, as well as raise themselves from darkness to light. Some of this sort are to be found among the nobles and VOL. I. 7 senators themselves, — a few among the very dregs of the people, but most among those who, securing for themselves competence and independence by their own labor in some of the useful arts, and growing thoughtful and intelligent with their labor, understand in some degree, which others do not, what life is for and what they are for, and hail with joy truths which commend themselves to both their reason and affections. It is out of these, the very best blood of Rome, that our Christians are made. They are, in intelligence and virtue, the very bone and muscle of the capital, and of our two millions constitute no mean proportion, — large enough to rule and control the whole, should they ever choose to put forth their power. It is among these that the Christian preachers aim to spread their doctrines, and when they shall all, or in their greater part, be converted, as, judging of the future by the past and present, will happen in no long time, Rome will be safe and the empire safe. For it needs, I am persuaded, for Rome to be as pure as she is great to be eternal in her dominion, and then the civilizer and saviour of the whole world. O, glorious age! — not remote — when truth shall wield the sceptre in Cæsar's seat, and subject nations of the earth no longer come up to Rome to behold and copy her vices, but to hear the law and be imbued with the doctrine of Christ, so bearing back to the remotest province precious seed, there to be planted, and spring up and bear fruit, filling the earth with beauty and fragrance. These things, Fausta, in answer to the questions at the close of your letter, which betray just such an interest in the subject which engrosses me, as it gives me pleasure to witness. I have before mentioned the completion of Aurelian's Temple of the Sun and the proposed dedication. This august ceremony is appointed for tomorrow, and this evening we are bidden to the gardens of Sallust, where is to be all the rank and beauty of Rome. O that thou, Fausta, couldst be there! I have been, I have seen, I have supped, I have returned; and again seated at my table beneath the protecting arm of my chosen divinity, I take my pen, and, by a few magic flourishes and marks, cause you a thousand leagues away, to see and hear what I have seen and heard — alas! that I cannot cause you to sup as I did also. But this is beyond the power of the pen. Accompanied by Portia and Julia, I was within the palace of the emperor early enough to enjoy the company of Aurelian and Livia before the rest of the world was there. We were carried to the more private apartments of the empress, where it is her custom to receive those whose friendship she values most highly. They are in that part of the palace which has undergone no alterations since it was the residence of the great historian, but shines in all the lustre of a taste and an art that adorned a more accomplished age than our own. Especially, it seems to me, in the graceful disposition of the interiors of their palaces, and the combined richness and appropriateness of the art lavished upon them, did the genius of the days of Hadrian and Vespasian surpass our own. Not that I defend all that that genius adopted and immortalized. It was not seldom licentious and gross in its conceptions, however unrivalled in the art and science by which they were made to glow upon the walls, or actually speak and move in marble or brass. In the favorite apartment of Livia, into which we were now admitted, perfect in its forms and proportions, the walls and ceilings are covered with the story of Leda, wrought with an effect of drawing and color, of which the present times afford no example. The well-known Greek, Polymnestes, was the artist. And this room in all its embellishments is chaste and cold compared with others, whose subjects were furnished to the painter by the profligate master himself. The room of Leda, as it is termed, is — but how beautiful it is I cannot tell. Words paint poorly to the eye. Believe it not less beautiful, nor less exquisitely adorned with all that woman loves most, hangings, carpets and couches, than any in the palace of Gracchus or Zenobia. It was here we found Aurelian and Livia, and his niece Aurelia. The emperor — habited in silken robes richly wrought with gold, the inseparable sword at his side, from which, at the expense of whatever incongruity, he never parts — advanced to the door to receive us, saying, `I am happy that the mildness of this autumn day permits this pleasure, to see the mother of the Pisos beneath my roof. It is rare nowadays that Rome sees her abroad.' `Save to the palace of Aurelian,' replied my mother, `I now, as is well known, never move beyond the precincts of my own dwelling. Since the captivity and death of your former companion in arms, my great husband, Cneius Piso, the widow's hearth has been my hall of state, these widow's weeds my only robes. But it must be more than private grief, and more than the storms of autumn or of winter, that would keep me back when it is Aurelian who bids to the feast.' `We owe you many thanks,' replied the emperor. `Would that the loyalty of the parents were inherited by the children;' casting towards me, as he saluted me at the same time, a look which seemed to say that he was partly serious if partly in jest. After mutual inquiries and salutations, we were soon seated upon couches beneath a blaze of light which, from the centre of the apartment, darted its brightness, as it had been the sun itself, to every part of the room. `It is no light sorrow to a mother's heart,' said Portia, `to know that her two sons, and her only sons, are, one the open enemy of his country, the other — what shall I term you, Lucius? — an innovator upon her ancient institutions; and while he believes and calls himself — sincerely, I doubt not — the friend of his country, is in truth, as every good Roman would say — not an enemy, my son, I cannot use that word, but as it were — an unconscious injurer. Would that the conqueror of the world had power to conquer this boy's will!' `Aurelian, mother,' I replied, `did he possess the power, would hesitate to use it in such a cause. But it is easy to see that it would demand infinitely more power to change one honest mind than to subdue even the world by the sword.' Aurelian for a brief moment looked as if he had received a personal affront. `How say you,' said he, `demands it more power to change one mind than conquer a world? Methinks it VOL. I. 7* might be done with something less. My soldiers often maintain with violence a certain opinion; but I find it not difficult to cause them to let it go, and take mine in its place. The arguments I use never fail.' `That may be,' I replied, `in matters of little moment. Even in these however, is it not plain, Aurelian, that you cause them not to let go their opinion, but merely to suppress it, or affect to change it. Your power may compel them either to silence, or to an assertion of the very contrary of what they but just before had declared as their belief, but it cannot alter their minds. That is to be done by reason only, not by force.' `By reason first,' answered the emperor; `but if that fail, then by force. The ignorant, and the presumptuous, and the mischievous, must be dealt with as we deal with children. If we argue with them, it is a favor. It is our right, as it is better, to command and compel.' `Only establish it that such and such are ignorant, and erroneous, and presumptuous, and I allow that it would be right to silence them. But that is the very difficulty in the case. How are we to know that they, who think differently from ourselves, are ignorant or erroneous? Surely the fact of the difference is not satisfactory proof.' `They,' rejoined Aurelian, `who depart from a certain standard in art are said to err. The thing in this case is of no consequence to any, therefore no punishment ensues. So there is a standard of religion in the state, and they who depart from it may be said to err. But as religion is essential to the state, they who err should be brought back, by whatever application of force, and compelled to conform to the standard.' `In what sense,' said Portia, `can common and ignorant people be regarded as fit judges of what constitutes or does not constitute a true religion? It is a subject level scarce to philosophers. If indeed the gods should vouchsafe to descend to earth and converse with men, and in that manner teach some new truth, then any one, possessed of eyes and ears, might receive it, and retain it without presumption. Nay, he could not but do so; but not otherwise.' `Now have you stated,' said I, `that which constitutes the precise case of Christianity. They who received Christianity in the first instance, did it not by balancing against each other such refined arguments as philosophers use. They were simply judges of matters of fact — of what their eyes beheld and their ears heard. God did vouchsafe to descend to earth, and by his messenger converse with men, and teach new truth. All that men had then to do was this, to see whether the evidence was sufficient that it was a God speaking; and that being made plain, to listen and record. And at this day, all that is to be done is to inquire whether the record be true. If the record be a well-authenticated one of what the mouth of God spoke, it is then adopted as the code of religious truth. As for what the word contains — it requires no acute intellect to judge concerning it — a child may understand it all.' `Truly,' replied Portia, `this agrees but ill with what I have heard and believed concerning Christianity. It has ever been set forth as a thing full of darkness and mystery, which it requires the most vigorous powers to penetrate and comprehend.' `So has it been ever presented to me,' added the emperor. `I have conceived it to be but some new form of Plato's dreams, neither more clear in itself, nor promising to be of more use to mankind. So, if I err not, the learned Porphyrus has stated it.' `A good fact,' here interposed Julia, `is worth more in this argument than the learning of the most learned. Is it not sufficient proof, Aurelian, that Christianity is somewhat sufficiently plain and easy, that women are able to receive it so readily? Take me as an unanswerable argument on the side of Piso.' `The women of Palmyra,' replied the emperor, `as I have good reason to know, are more than the men of other climes. She who reads Plato and the last essays of Plotinus, of a morning, seated idly beneath the shadow of some spreading beech, just as a Roman girl would the last child's story of Spurius about father Tiber and the Milvian Bridge, is not to be received in this question as but a woman, with a woman's powers of judgment. When the women of Rome receive their faith as easily as you do, then may it be held as an argument for its simplicity. But let us now break off the thread of this discourse, too severe for the occasion, and mingle with our other friends, who by this must be arrived.' So with these words we left the apartment where we had been sitting, the emperor having upon one side Portia, and on the other Livia, and moved toward the great central rooms of the palace, where guests are entertained and the imperial banquets held. The company was not numerous; it was rather remarkable for its selectness. Among others not less distinguished, there were the venerable Tacitus, the consul Capitolinus, Marcellinus the senator, the prefect Varus, the priest Fronto, the generals Probus and Mucapor, and a few other of the military favorites of Aurelian. Of the conversation at supper I remember little or nothing, only that it was free and light, each seeming to enjoy himself and the companion who reclined next to him. Aurelian, with a condescending grace which no one knows how better to assume than he, urged the wine upon his friends, as they appeared occasionally to forget it, offering frequently some new and unheard of kind, brought from Asia, Greece or Africa, and which he would exalt to the skies for its flavor. More than once did he, as he is wont to do in his sporting mood, deceive us; for, calling upon us to fill our goblets with what he described as a liquor surpassing all of Italy, and which might serve for Hebe to pour out for the gods, and requiring us to drink it off in honor of Bacchus, Pan or Ceres, we found upon lifting our cups to drain them that they had been charged with some colored and perfumed medicament more sour or bitter than the worst compound of the apothecary, or than massican overheated in the vats. These sallies, coming from the master of the world, were sure to be well received; his satellites, of whom not a few were near him, being ready to die with excess of laughter, — the attendant slaves catching the jest, and enjoying it with noisy vociferation. I laughed with the rest, for it seems wise to propitiate, by any act not absolutely base, one whose ambitious and cruel nature, unless soothed and appeased by such offerings, is so prone to reveal itself in deeds of darkness. When the feast was nearly ended, and the attending slaves were employed in loading it for the last time with fruits, olives, and confections, a troop of eunuchs, richly habited, entered the apartment to the sound of flutes and horns, bearing upon a platter of gold an immense bowl or vase of the same metal, filled to the brim with wine, which they placed in the centre of the table, and then, at the command of the emperor, with a ladle of the same precious material and ornamented with gems, served out the wine to the company. At first, as the glittering pageant advanced, astonishment kept us mute, and caused us involuntarily to rise from our couches to watch the ceremony of introducing it and fixing it in its appointed place. For never before in Rome had there been seen, I am sure, a golden vessel of such size, or wrought with art so marvellous. The language of wonder and pleasure was heard, on every side, from every mouth. Even Livia and Julia, who in Palmyra had been used to the goblets and wine cups of the eastern Demetrius, showed amazement not less than the others at a magnificence and a beauty that surpassed all experience and all conception. Just above where the bowl was placed hung the principal light, by which the table and the apartment were illuminated, which, falling in floods upon the wrought or polished gold and the thickly strewed diamonds, caused it to blaze with a splendor which the eyes could hardly bear, and, till accustomed to it by gazing, prevented us from minutely examining the sculptures, which, with lavish profusion and consummate art, glowed and burned upon the pedestal, the swelling sides, the rim and handles of the vase, and covered the broad and golden plain upon which it stood. I happily was near it, being seated opposite Aurelian, and on the inner side of the table, which, as the custom now is, was of the form of a bent bow, so that I could study at my leisure the histories and fables that were wrought over its whole surface. Julia and Livia, being also near it on the other side of the table, were in the same manner wholly absorbed in the same agreeable task. Livia, being quite carried out of herself by this sudden and unexpected splendor — having evidently no knowledge of its approach — like a girl as she still is in her natural, unpremeditated movements, rose from her couch and eagerly bent forward toward the vase, the better to scan its beauties, saying, as she did so, `The emperor must himself stand answerable for all breaches of order under circumstances like these. Good friends, let all who will freely approach, and, leaving for a moment that of Bacchus, drink at the fountain of Beauty.' Whereupon, all who were so disposed gathered round the centre of the table. `This,' said Varus, `both for size and the perfect art lavished upon it, surpasses the glories fabled of the buckler of Minerva, whose fame has reached us.' `You say right; it does so,' said the emperor. `That dish of Vitellius was inferior in workmanship, as it was less in weight and size than this, which, before you all, I here name “The Cup of Livia.” Let us fill again from it, and drink to the empress of all the world.' All sprang in eager haste to comply with a command that carried with it its own enforcement. `Whatever,' continued the emperor, when our cups had been drained, `may have been the condition of art in other branches of it, in the time of that emperor, there was no one then whose power over the metals, or whose knowledge of forms, was comparable with that of our own Demetrius; for this, be it known, is the sole work of the Roman — and yet, to speak more truly, it must be said the Greek — Demetrius, aided by his brother from the east, who is now with him. Let the music cease; we need that disturbance no more; and call in the brothers Demetrius. These are men who honor any age and any presence.' The brothers soon entered; and never were princes or ambassadors greeted with higher honor. All seemed to contend which should say the most flattering and agreeable thing. `Slaves,' cried the emperor, `a couch and cups for the Demetrii.' The brothers received all this courtesy with the native ease and dignity which ever accompany true genius. There was no offensive boldness nor presuming vanity, but neither was there any shrinking cowardice nor timidity. They felt that they were men not less distinguished by the gods than many or most of those in whose presence they were, and they were sufficient to themselves. The Roman Demetrius resembles much his brother of Palmyra, but in both form and countenance possesses beauty of a higher order. His look is contemplative and inward; his countenance pale and yet dark; his features even and exactly shaped, like a statue; his hair short and black; his dress, as was that of him of Palmyra, of the richest stuffs, and showing that wealth had become their reward as well as fame. `Let us,' cried the emperor, `in full cups drawn from the Livian fount, do honor to ourselves, and the arts, by drinking to the health of Demetrius of Palmyra and Demetrius of Rome.' Every cup was filled and drained. `We owe you thanks,' then added Aurelian, `that you have completed this great work at the time promised, though I fear it has been to your own cost, for the paleness of your cheeks speaks not of health.' `The work,' replied the Roman Demetrius, `could not have been completed but for the timely and effectual aid of my eastern brother, to whose learned hand, quicker in its execution than my own, you are indebted for the greater part of the sculptures upon both the bowl and dish.' `It is true, noble emperor,' said the impetuous brother, `my hand is the quicker of the two, and in some parts of this work, especially in whatever pertains to the east, and to the forms of building or of vegetation, or costume seen chiefly or only there, my knowledge was perhaps more exact and minute than his; but let it be received, that the head that could design these forms, and conceive and arrange these histories, and these graceful ornaments — to my mind more fruitful of genius than all else — observe you them? have you scanned them all? — belongs to no other than Demetrius of Rome. In my whole hand there resides not the skill that is lodged in one of his fingers — nor in my whole head the power that lies behind one of his eyes.' The enthusiasm of the eastern brother called up a smile upon the faces of all, and a blush upon the white cheek of the Roman. `My brother is younger than I,' he said, `and his blood runs quicker. All that he says, though it be a picture of the truest heart ever lodged in man, is yet to VOL. I. 8 be taken with abatement. But for him, this work would have been far below its present merit. Let me ask you especially to mark the broad border where is set forth the late triumph, and ambassadors, captives, and animals of all parts of the earth, especially of the east, are seen in their appropriate forms and habits. That is all from the chisel of my brother. Behold here' — and rising he approached the vase, and vast as it was, by a touch — so was it constructed — turned it round — `behold here, where is figured the queen of —' in the enthusiasm of art he had forgotten for a moment to whom he was speaking, for at that instant his eye fell upon the countenance of Julia, who stood near him, and which he saw cast down by an uncontrollable grief. He paused, confused and grieved — saying, as he turned back the vase, `Ah me! cruel and indiscreet! Pardon me, noble ladies! and yet I deserve it not.” `Go on, go on, Demetrius,' said Julia, assuming a cheerful air. `You offend me not. The course of empire must have its way; individuals are but emmets in the path. I am now used to this, believe me. It is for you rather, and the rest, to forgive in me a sudden weakness.' Demetrius, thus commanded, resumed, and then with minuteness, with much learning and eloquence, discoursed successively upon the histories or emblematic devices of this the chief work of his hands. All were sorry when he ceased. `To what you have overlooked,' said Aurelian, as he paused, `must I call you back, seeing it is that part of the work which I most esteem, and in which at this moment I and all, I trust, are most interested — the sculptures upon the platter; and which represent the new temple and ceremonies of the dedication, which tomorrow we celebrate.' `Of this,' replied Demetrius, `I said less, because perhaps the work is inferior, having been committed, our time being short, to the hands of a pupil — a pupil, however, I beg to say, who, if the Divine Providence spare him, will one day, and that not a remote one, cast a shadow upon his teachers.' `That will he,' said the brother; `Flaccus is full of the truest inspiration.' `But to the dedication — the dedication,' interrupted the hoarse voice of Fronto. Demetrius started and shrunk backward a step at that sound, but instantly recovered himself, and read into an intelligible language many of the otherwise obscure and learned details of the sculpture. As he ended, the emperor said, `We thank you, Demetrius, for your learned lecture, which has given a new value to your work. And now, while it is in my mind, let me bespeak, as soon as leisure and inclination shall serve, a silver statue gilded of Apollo, for the great altar, which to-morrow will scarce be graced with such a one as will agree with the temple and its other ornaments.' Demetrius, as this was uttered, again started, and his countenance became of a deadly paleness. He hesitated a moment, as if studying how to order his words so as to express least offensively an offensive truth. On the instant I suspected what the truth was; but I was wholly unprepared for it. I had received no intimation of such a thing. `Great emperor,' he began, `I am sorry to say — and yet not sorry — that I cannot now as once labor for the decoration of the temples and their worship. I am —, `Ye gods of Rome, —' cried Fronto. `Peace,' said the emperor, `let him be heard. How say you?' `I am now a Christian, and I hold it not lawful to bestow my power and skill in the workmanship of gods, in whom I believe not, and thus become the instrument of an erroneous faith in others.' This was uttered firmly but with modesty. The countenance of the emperor was overclouded for a moment. But it partially cleared up again as he said, `I lay not, Demetrius, the least constraint upon you. The four years that I have held this power in Rome, have been years of freedom to my people in this respect. Whether I have done well in that for our city and the empire, many would doubt. I almost doubt myself.' `That would they, by Hercules,' said the soft voice of Varus just at my ear, and intended chiefly for me. `My brother,' said Demetrius, `will be happy to execute for the emperor the work which he has been pleased to ask of me. He remains steadfast in the faith in which he was reared; the popular faith of Athens.' `Apollo,' said Demetrius of Palmyra, `is my especial favorite among all the gods, and of him I have wrought more statues in silver, gold, or ivory, or of these variously and curiously combined, than of all the others. If I should be honored in this labor, I should request to adopt the marble image now standing in the baths of Caracalla, and once, it is said, the chief wonder of Otho's palace of wonders, as a model after which, with some deviations, to mould it. I think I could make that that should satisfy Aurelian and Rome.' `Do it, do it,' said the emperor, `and let it be seen that the worshipper of his country's gods is not behind him who denies them, in his power to do them honor.' `I shall not sleep,' said the enthusiastic artist, `till I have made a model in wax at least of what at this moment presents itself to my imagination.' Saying which, with little ceremony — as if the empire depended upon his reaching on the instant his chalk and wax — and to the infinite amusement of the company, he rose and darted from the apartment, the slaves making way as for a missile that it might be dangerous to obstruct. `But in what way,' said Aurelian, turning to the elder Demetrius, `have you been wrought upon to abandon the time-honored religion of Rome? Methinks the whole world is becoming of this persuasion.' `If I may speak freely —' `With utmost freedom,' said Aurelian. `I may then say that ever since the power to reflect upon matters so deep and high had been mine, I had doubted first the truth of the popular religion, and then soon rejected it, as what brought to me neither comfort nor hope, and was burdened with things essentially incredible and monstrous. For many years, many weary years — for the mind demands something positive in this quarter, it cannot remain in suspense, and vacant — I was without belief. Why it was so long before I turned to the Christians I know not, unless because of the reports which were so common to their disadvantage, and the danger which has so often attended a profession of their faith At length, in a fortunate hour, VOL. I. 8* there fell into my hands the sacred books of the Christians, and I needed little besides to show me that theirs is a true and almighty faith, and that all that is current in the city to its dishonor is false and calumnious. I am now happy, not only as an artist and a Roman, but as a man and an immortal.' `You speak earnestly,' said Aurelian. `I feel so,' replied Demetrius, a generous glow lighting up his pale countenance. `Would,' rejoined the emperor, `that some of the zeal of these Christians might be infused into the sluggish spirits of our own people. The ancient faith suffers through neglect, and the prevailing impiety of those who are its disciples.' `May it not rather be,' said Fronto, `that the ancient religion of the state, having so long been neglected by those who are its appointed guardians, to the extent that even Judaism and now Christianity — which are but disguised forms of Atheism — have been allowed to insinuate and intrench themselves in the empire — the gods now in anger turn away from us, who have been so unfaithful to ourselves, and thus this plausible impiety is permitted to commit its havocs. I believe the gods are ever faithful to the faithful.' `What good citizen, too,' added Varus, `but must lament to witness the undermining and supplanting of those venerable forms under which this universal empire has grown to its present height of power? He is scarcely a Roman who denies the gods of Rome, however observant he may be of her laws and other institutions. Religion is her greatest law.' `These are hard questions,' said the emperor. `For know you not that some of our noblest, and fairest, and most beloved, have written themselves followers of this Gallilean God? How can we deal sharply with a people at whose head stands the head of the noble house of the Pisos, and a princess of the blood of Palmyra?' Although Aurelian uttered these words in a manner almost sportive to the careless ear, yet I confess myself to have discovered at the moment an inward expression of the countenance and a tone in the voice, which for the time gave me uneasiness. I was about to speak, when the venerable Tacitus addressed the emperor and said, `I can never think it wise to interfere with violence in the matter of men's worship. It is impossible, I believe, to compel mankind to receive any one institution of religion, because different tribes of men, different by nature and by education, will and do demand, not the same, but different forms of belief and worship. Why should they be alike in this, while they separate so widely in other matters? and can it be a more hopeful enterprise to oblige them to submit to the same rules in their religion, than it would be to compel them to feed on the same food, and use the same forms of language or dress? I know that former emperors have thought and acted differently. They have deemed it a possible thing to restore the ancient unity of worship, by punishing with severity, by destroying the lives even of such as should dare to think for themselves. But their conduct is not to be defended, either as right in itself or best for the state. It has not been true, as policy. For is it not evident, how oppression of those who believe themselves to be possessed of truth important to mankind, serves but to bind them the more closely to their opinions? Are they, for a little suffering, to show themselves such cowards as to desert their own convictions, and prove false to the interests of multitudes? Rather, say they, let us rejoice in such a cause to bear reproach. This is the language of our nature. Nay, such persons come to prize suffering, to make it a matter of pride and boasting. Their rank among themselves is by and by determined by the readiness with which they offer themselves as sacrifices for truth and God. Are such persons to be deterred by threats, or the actual infliction of punishment?' `The error has been,' here said the evil-boding Fronto, `that the infliction of punishment went not to the extent that is indispensable to the success of such a work. The noble Piso will excuse me; we are but dealing with abstractions. Oppress those who are in error only to a certain degree, not extreme, and it is most true they cling the closer to their error. We see this in the punishment of children. Their obstinacy and pride are increased by a suffering which is slight, and which seems to say, `I am too timid, weak, or loving, to inflict more.' So too with our slaves. Whose slaves ever rose a second time against the master's authority whose first offence, however slight, was met, not by words or lashes, but by racks and the cross?' `Nay, good Fronto, hold; your zeal for the gods bears you away beyond the bounds of courtesy.' `Forgive me then, great sovereign, and you who are here — if you may; but neither time nor place shall deter me, a minister of the great god of light, from asserting the principles upon which his worship rests, and, as I deem, the empire itself. Under Decius, had true Romans sat on the tribunals, had no hearts too soft for such offices turned traitors to the head, had no accursed spirit of avarice received the bribes which procured security to individuals, families, and communities; had there been no commutations of punishment, then —' `Peace, I say, Fronto; thou marrest the spirit of the hour. How came we thus again to this point? Such questions are for the council-room or the senate. Yet, truth to say, so stirred seems the mind of this whole people in the matter, that in battle one may as well escape from the din of clashing arms or the groans of the dying, as in Rome avoid this argument. Nay, by my sword, not a voice can I hear, either applauding, disputing or condemning, since I have set on foot this new war in the east. Once, the city would have rung with acclamations that an army was gathering for such an enterprise. Now, it seems quite forgotten that Valerian once fell, or that, late though it be, he ought to be revenged. This Jewish and Christian argument fills all heads, and clamors on every tongue. Come, let us shake off this dæmon in a new cup, and drink deep to the revenge of Valerian.' `And of the gods,' ejaculated Fronto, as he lifted the goblet to his lips.' `There again?' quickly and sharply demanded Aurelian, bending his dark brows upon the offender. `Doubtless,' said Portia, `he means well, though over zealous and rash in speech. His heart I am sure seconds not the cruel language of his tongue. So at least I will believe; and in the meantime hope that the zeal he has displayed for the ancient religion of our country may not be without its use upon some present' — glancing her eye towards me and Julia — `who, with what I trust will prove a brief truancy, have wandered from their household gods and the temples of their fathers.' `May the gods grant it,' added Livia, `and restore the harmony which should reign in our families and in the capital. Life is over brief to be passed in quarrel. Now let us abandon our cups. Sir Christian Piso! lead me to the gardens, and let the others follow as they may our good example.' The gardens we found, as we passed from the palace, to be most brilliantly illuminated with lamps of every form and hue. We seemed suddenly to have passed to another world, so dream-like was the effect of the multitudinous lights as they fell with white, red, lurid, or golden glare upon bush or tree, grotto, statue, or marble fountain. `Forget here, Lucius Piso,' said the kind-hearted Livia, `what you have just heard from the lips of that harsh bigot, the savage Fronto. Who could have looked for such madness! Not again, if I possess the power men say I do, shall he sit at the table of Aurelian. Poor Julia too! But see! she walks with Tacitus. Wisdom and mercy are married in him, and both will shed comfort on her.' `I cannot but lament,' I replied, `that a creature like Fronto should have won his way so far into the confidence of Aurelian. But I fear him not, and do not believe that he will have power to urge the emperor to the adoption of measures, to which his own wisdom and native feelings must stand opposed. The rage of such men as Fronto, and the silent pity and scorn of men immeasurably his superiors, we have both now learned to bear without complaint, though not without some inward suffering. To be shut out from the hearts of so many who once ran to meet us on our approach, nor only that, but to be held by them as impious and atheistical, monsters whom the earth is sick of, and whom the gods are besought to destroy — this is a part of our burden which we feel to be heaviest. Heaven preserve to us the smiles and the love of Livia.' `Doubt not that they will ever be yours. But I trust that sentiments like those of Tacitus will bear sway in the councils of Aurelian, and that the present calm will not be disturbed.' Thus conversing we wandered on, beguiled by such talk and the attractive splendors of the garden, till we found ourselves separated, apparently by some distance, from our other friends; none passed us and none met us. We had reached a remote and solitary spot, where fewer lamps had been hung, and the light was faint and unequal. Not sorry to be thus alone, we seated ourselves on the low pedestal of a group of statuary — once the favorite resort of the fair and false Terentia — whose forms could scarcely be defined, and which was enveloped at a few paces distant with shrubs and flowers, forming a thin wall of partition between us and another walk, corresponding to the one we were in, but winding away in a different direction. We had sat not long, either silent or conversing, ere our attention was caught by the sound of approaching voices apparently in earnest discourse. A moment and we knew them to be those of Fronto and Aurelian. `By the gods his life shall answer it,' said Aurelian with vehemence, but with suppressed tones; `who but he was to observe the omens? Was I to know that to-day is the Ides and to-morrow the day after? The rites must be postponed.' `It were better not, in my judgment,' said Fronto; `all the other signs are favorable. Never, Papirius assured me, did the sacred chickens seize so eagerly the crumbs. Many times, as he closely watched, did he observe them — which is rare — drop them from their mouths overfilled. The times he has exactly recorded. A rite like this put off, when all Rome is in expectation, would in the opinion of all the world be of a more unfavorable interpretation, than if more than the day were against us.' `You counsel well. Let it go on.' `But to ensure a fortunate event, and propitiate the gods, I would early, and before the august ceremonies, offer the most costly and acceptable sacrifice.' `That were well also. In the prisons there are captives of Germany, of Gaul, of Egypt and Palmyra. Take what and as many as you will. If we ever make sure of the favor of the gods, it is when we offer freely that which we hold at the highest price.' `I would rather they were Christians,' urged Fronto. `That cannot be,' said Aurelian. `I question if there be a Christian within the prison walls; and, were there hundreds, it is not a criminal I would bring to the altar. I would as soon offer a diseased or ill-shaped bull.' `But it were an easy matter to seize such as we might want. Not, O Aurelian, till this accursed race is exterminated, will the heavens smile as formerly upon our country. Why are the altars thus forsaken? Why are the temples no longer thronged as once? Why do the great, and the rich, and the learned, silently withhold their aid or openly scoff and jeer? Why are our sanctuaries crowded only by the scum and refuse of the city?' `I know not. Question me not thus.' `Is not the reason palpable and gross to the dullest mind? Is it not because of the daily growth of this blaspheming and atheistical crew, who, by horrid arts, seduce the young, the timid, and above all the women, who ever draw the world with them, to join them in their unhallowed orgies, thus stripping the temples of their worshippers and dragging the gods themselves from their seats? Think you the gods look on with pleasure while their altars and temples are profaned or abandoned, and a religion that denies them rears itself upon their ruins?' `I know not. Say no more.' `Is it possible religion or the state should prosper, while he, who is not only Vicegerent of the gods, Universal Monarch, but what is more, their sworn Pontifex Maximus, connives at their existence and dissemination —' `Thou liest.' `Harboring even beneath the imperial roof, and feasting at the imperial table, the very heads and chief ministers of this black mischief —' `Hold, I say. I swear, by all the gods known and unknown, that another word, and thy head shall answer VOL. I. 9 it. Is my soul that of a lamb, that I need this stirring up to deeds of blood? Am I so lame and backward, when the gods are to be defended, that I am to be thus charged? Let the lion sleep when he will; chafed too much, and he may spring and slay at random. I love not the Christians, nor any who flout the gods and their worship — that thou knowest well. But I love Piso, Aurelia, and the divine Julia — that thou knowest as well. Now no more.' `For my life,' said Fronto, `I hold it cheap, if I may but be faithful to my office and the gods.' `I believe it, Fronto. The gods will reward thee. Let us on.' In the earnestness of their talk they had paused and stood just before us, being separated but by a thin screen of shrubs. We continued rooted to our seats while this conversation went on, held there both by the impossibility of withdrawing without observation, and by a desire to hear — I confess it — what was thus in a manner forced upon me, and concerned so nearly, not only myself, but thousands of my fellow-Christians. When they were hidden from us by the winding of the path, we rose and turned toward the palace. `That savage!' said Livia. `How strange that Aurelian, who knows so well how to subdue the world, should have so little power to shake off this reptile.' `There is power enough,' I replied; `but alas! I fear the will is wanting. Superstition is as deep a principle in the breast of Aurelian as ambition, and of that Fronto is the most fitting high-priest. Aurelian places him at the head of religion in the state for those very qualities, whose fierce expression has now made us tremble. Let us hope that the emperor will remain where he now is, in a position from which it seems Fronto is unable to dislodge him, and all will go well.' We soon reached the palace, where, joining Julia and Portia, our chariot soon bore us to the Cœlian Hill, Farewell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER IV. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. I promised you, Fausta, before the news should reach you in any other way, to relate the occurrences and describe the ceremonies of the day appointed for the dedication of the new Temple of the Sun. The day has now passed, not without incidents of even painful interest to ourselves and therefore to you, and I sit down to fulfill my engagements. Vast preparations had been making for the dedication for many days or even months preceding, and the day arose upon a city full of expectation of the shows, ceremonies and games that were to reward their long and patient waiting. For the season of the year the day was hot, unnaturally so; and the sky filled with those massive clouds, piled like mountains of snow one upon another, which, while they both please the eye by their forms and veil the fierce splendors of the sun as they now and then sail across his face, at the same time portend wind and storm. All Rome was early astir. It was ushered in by the criers traversing the streets and proclaiming the rites and spectacles of the day, what they were and where to be witnessed, followed by troops of boys imitating in their grotesque way the pompous declarations of the men of authority, not unfrequently drawing down upon their heads the curses and the batons of the insulted dignitaries. A troop of this sort passed the windows of the room in which Julia and I were sitting at our morning meal. As the crier ended his proclamation and the shouts of the applauding urchins died away, Milo, who is our attendant in preference to any other and all others, observed, `That the fellow of a crier deserved to have his head beat about with his own rod, for coming round with his news not till after the greatest show of the day was over.' `What mean you?' I asked. `Explain.' `What should I mean,' he replied, `but the morning sacrifice at the temple.' `And what so wonderful,' said Julia, `in a morning sacrifice? The temples are open every morning, are they not?' `Yes, truly are they,' rejoined Milo; `but not for so great a purpose. Curio wished me to have been there, and says nothing could have been more propitious. They died as the gods love to have them.' `Was there no bellowing nor struggling, then?' said Julia. `Neither, Curio assures me; but they met the knife of the priest as they would the sword of an enemy on the field of battle.' `How say you?' said Julia, quickly, turning pale; `do I hear aright, Milo, or are you mocking? God forbid that you should speak of a human sacrifice.' `It is even so, mistress. And why should it not be so? If the favor of the gods, upon whom we all depend, as the priests tell us, is to be purchased so well in no other way, what is the life of one man or of many in such a cause? The great Gallienus, when his life had VOL. I. 9* been less ordered than usual, after the rules of temperance and religion, used to make amends by a few captives slain to Jupiter; to which, doubtless, may be ascribed his prosperous reign. But, as I was saying, there was, as Curio informed me, at the market, not long afterwards, a sacrifice, on the private altar of the temple, of ten captives. Their blood flowed just as the great god of the temple showed himself in the horizon. It would have done you good, Curio said, to see with what a hearty and dexterous zeal Fronto struck the knife into their hearts — for to no inferior minister would he delegate the sacred office.' `Lucius,' cried Julia, `I thought that such offerings were now no more. Is it so, that superstition yet delights itself in the blood of murdered men?' `It is just so,' I was obliged to reply. `With a people naturally more gentle and humane than we of Rome this custom would long ago have fallen into disuse. They would have easily found a way, as all people do, to conform their religious doctrine and offerings to their feelings and instincts. But the Romans, by nature and long training, lovers of blood, their country built upon the ruins of others and cemented with blood — the taste for it is not easily eradicated. There are temples where human sacrifices have never ceased. Laws have restrained their frequency — have forbidden them under heaviest penalties unless permitted by the state — but these laws ever have been, and are now evaded; and it is the settled purpose of Fronto and others of his stamp to restore to them their lost honors, and make them again, as they used to be, the chief rite in the worship of the gods. I am not sorry, Julia, that your doubts, though so painfully, have yet been so effectually removed.' Julia had for some time blamed as over-ardent the zeal of the Christians. She had thought that the evil of the existing superstitions was over-estimated and that it were wiser to pursue a course of more moderation; that a system that nourished such virtues as she found in Portia, in Tacitus, and others like them, could not be so corrupting in its power as the Christians were in the habit of representing it; that if we could succeed in substituting Christianity quietly, without alienating the affections or shocking too violently the prejudices of the believers in the prevailing superstitions, our gain would be double. To this mode of arguing I knew she was impelled by her love and almost reverence of Portia; and how could I blame it, springing from such a cause? I had, almost criminally, allowed her to blind herself in a way she never would have done had her strong mind acted, as on other subjects, untramelled and free. I was not sorry that Milo had brought before her mind a fact which, however revolting in its horror to such a nature as hers, could not but heal while it wounded. `Milo,' said Julia, as I ended, `say now that you have been jesting; that this is a piece of wit with which you would begin in a suitable way an extraordinary day; this is one of your Gallienus fictions.' `Before the gods, if never before,' replied Milo, `I have told you the naked truth. But not the whole — for Curio left me not till he had shown how each had died. Of the ten, but three, he averred, resisted, or died unwillingly. The three were Germans from beyond the Danube — brothers, he said, who had long lain in prison till their bones were ready to start through the skin. Yet were they not ready to die. It seemed as if there were something they longed — more even than for life or freedom — to say; but they might as well have been dumb and tongueless, for none understood their barbarous jargon. When they found that their words were in vain, they wrung their hands in their wo, and cried out aloud in their agony. Then, however, at the stern voice of Fronto warning them of the hour, they ceased — embraced each other, and received the fatal blow; the others signified their pleasure at dying so rather than to be thrown to wild beasts or left to die by slow degrees within their dungeon's walls. Two rejoiced that it was their fate to pour out their blood upon the altar of a god, and knelt devoutly before the uplifted knife of Fronto. Never, said Curio, was there a more fortunate offering. Aurelian heard the report of it with lively joy, and said that `now all would go well.' Curio is a good friend of mine; will it please you to hear these things from his own lips?' `No,' said Julia; `I would hear no more. I have heard more than enough. How needful, Lucius, if these things are so, that our Christian zeal abate not! I see that this stern and bloody superstition requires that they who would deal with it must carry their lives in their hand, ready to part with nothing so easily, if by so doing they can hew away one of the branches or tear up one of the roots of this ancient and pernicious error. I blame not Probus longer — no, nor the wild rage of Macer.' `Two, lady, of the captives were of Palmyra; the queen's name and yours were last upon their lips.' `Great God! how retribution like a dark pursuing shadow hangs upon the steps of guilt. Even here it seeks us. Alas, my mother! Heaven grant that these things fall not upon your ears!' Julia was greatly moved, and sat a long time silent, her face buried in her hands, and weeping. I motioned to Milo to withdraw and say no more. Upon Julia, although so innocent of all wrong — guiltless as an infant of the blame, whatever it may be, which the world fixes upon Zenobia — yet upon her as heavily as upon her great mother fall the sorrows which sooner or later overtake those who for any purpose, in whatever degree selfish, have involved their fellow-creatures in useless suffering. Being part of the royal house, Julia feels that she must bear her portion of its burdens. Time alone can cure this grief. But you are waiting with a woman's impatient curiosity to hear of the dedication. At the appointed hour we were at the palace of Aurelian on the Palatine, where a procession, pompous as art and rank and numbers could make it, was formed, to move thence by a winding and distant route to the temple near the foot of the Quirinal. Julia repaired with Portia to a place of observation near the temple — I to the palace to join the company of the emperor. Of the gorgeous magnificence of the procession I shall tell you nothing. It was in extent and variety of pomp and costliness of decoration, a copy of that of the late triumph, and went even beyond the captivating splendor of the example. Roman music — which is not that of Palmyra — lent such charms as it could to our passage through the streets to the temple, from a thousand performers. As we drew near to the lofty fabric, I thought that no scene of such various beauty and magnificence had ever met my eye. The temple itself is a work of unrivaled art. In size it surpasses any other building of the same kind in Rome, and for the excellence of workmanship and purity of design, although it may fall below the standard of Hadrian's age, yet for a certain air of grandeur and luxuriance of invention in its details, and lavish profusion of embellishment in gold and silver, no temple nor other edifice of any preceding age ever perhaps resembled it. Its order is the Corinthian, of the Roman form, and the entire building is surrounded by its slender columns, each composed of a single piece of marble. Upon the front is wrought Apollo surrounded by the Hours. The western extremity is approached by a flight of steps of the same breadth as the temple itself. At the eastern there extends beyond the walls to a distance equal to the length of the building a marble platform, upon which stands the altar of sacrifice, and which is ascended by various flights of steps, some little more than a gently rising plain, up which the beasts are led that are destined to the altar. When this vast extent of wall and column of the most dazzling brightness came into view, everywhere covered, together with the surrounding temples, palaces and theatres, with a dense mass of human beings, of all climes and regions, dressed out in their richest attire — music from innumerable instruments filling the heavens with harmony — shouts of the proud and excited populace every few moments and from different points, as Aurelian advanced, shaking the air with its thrilling din — the neighing of horses, the frequent blasts of the trumpet — the whole made more solemnly imposing by the vast masses of cloud which swept over the sky, now suddenly unveiling and again eclipsing the sun, the great god of this idolatry, and from which few could withdraw their gaze; — when at once this all broke upon my eye and ear, I was like a child who before had never seen aught but his own village and his own rural temple, in the effect wrought upon me, and the passiveness with which I abandoned myself to the sway of the senses. Not one there was more ravished by the outward circumstance and show. I thought of Rome's thousand years, of her power, her greatness and universal empire, and for a moment my step was not less proud than that of Aurelian. But after that moment — when the senses had had their fill, when the eye had seen the glory, and the ear had fed upon the harmony and the praise, then I thought and felt very differently; sorrow and compassion for these gay multitudes were at my heart; prophetic forebodings of disaster, danger, and ruin to those to whose sacred cause I had linked myself, made my tongue to falter in its speech and my limbs to tremble. I thought that the superstition that was upheld by the wealth and the power, whose manifestations were before me, had its roots in the very centre of the earth — far too deep down for a few like myself ever to reach them. I was like one whose last hope of life and escape is suddenly struck away. I was roused from these meditations by our arrival at the eastern front of the temple. Between the two central columns, on a throne of gold and ivory, sat the emperor of the world, surrounded by the senate, the colleges of augurs and haruspices, and by the priests of the various temples of the capital, all in their peculiar costume. Then Fronto, the priest of the temple, when the crier had proclaimed that the hour of worship and sacrifice had come, and had commanded silence to be observed — standing at the altar, glittering in his white and golden robes like a messenger of light — bared his head, and lifting his face up toward the sun, offered in clear and sounding tones the prayer of dedication. As he came toward the close of his prayer, he, as is so usual, with loud and almost frantic cries and importunate repetition, called upon the god to hear him, and then with appropriate names and praises invoked the Father of gods and men to be present and hear. Just as he had thus solemnly invoked Jupiter by name, and was about to call upon the other gods in the same manner, the clouds, which had been deepening and darkening, suddenly obscured the sun; a distant peal of thunder rolled along the heavens, and at the same moment from the dark recesses of the temple a voice of preternatural power came forth, proclaiming so that the whole multitude heard the words — `God is but one; the king eternal, immortal, invisible.' It is impossible to describe the horror that seized those multitudes. Many cried out with fear, and each seemed to shrink behind the other. Paleness sat upon every face. The priest paused as if struck by a power from above. Even the brazen Fronto was appalled. Aurelian leaped from his seat, and by his countenance, white and awe-struck, showed that to him it came as a voice from the gods. He spoke not, but stood gazing at the dark entrance into the temple from which the sound had come. Fronto hastily approached him, and whispering but one word as it were into his ear, the emperor started; the spell that bound him was dissolved; and recovering himself — making indeed as though a very different feeling had possessed him — cried out in fierce tones to his guards, `Search the temple; some miscreant hid away among the columns profanes thus the worship and the place. Seize him and drag him forth to instant death.' The guards of the emperor and the servants of the temple rushed in at that bidding, and searched in every part the interior of the building. They soon emerged, saying that the search was fruitless. The temple in all its aisles and apartments was empty. The ceremonies, quiet being again restored, then went on. Twelve bulls, of purest white and of perfect forms, their horns bound about with fillets, were now led by the servants of the temple up the marble steps to the front of the altar, where stood the cultrarii and haruspices, ready to slay them and examine their entrails. The omens as gathered by the eyes of all from the fierce strugglings and bellowings of the animals as they were led toward the place of sacrifice — some even escaping from the hands of those who had the management of them — and from the violent and convulsive throes of others as the blow fell upon their heads, or the knife severed their throats, were of the darkest character, and brought a deep gloom upon the brow of the emperor. The report of the haruspices upon examination of the entrails was little calculated to remove that gloom. It VOL. I. 10 was for the most part unfavorable. Especially appalling was the sight of a heart so lean and withered that it scarce seemed possible it should ever have formed a part of a living animal. But more harrowing than all was the voice of Fronto, who prying with the haruspices into the smoking carcass of one of the slaughtered bulls, suddenly cried out with horror that `no heart was to be found.' The emperor, hardly to be restrained by those near him from some expression of anger, ordered a more diligent search to be made. `It is not in nature that such a thing should be,' he said. `Men are, in truth, sometimes without hearts; but brutes, as I think, never.' The report was however confidently confirmed. Fronto himself approached, and said that his eye had from the first been upon the beast, and the exact truth had been stated. The carcasses, such parts as were for the flames, were then laid upon the vast altar, and the flames of the sacrifice ascended. The heavens were again obscured by thick clouds, which accumulating into dark masses began now nearer and nearer to shoot forth lightning and roll their thunders. The priest commenced the last office, prayer to the god to whom the new temple had been thus solemnly consecrated. He again bowed his head, and again lifted up his voice. But no sooner had he invoked the god of the temple and besought his ear, than again from its dark interior the same awful sounds issued forth, this time saying `Thy gods, O Rome, are false and lying gods. God is but one.' Aurelian, pale as it seemed to me with superstitious fear, strove to shake it off, giving it artfully and with violence the appearance of offended dignity. His voice was a shriek rather than a human utterance, as he cried out, `This is but a Christian device; search the temple till the accursed Nazarene be found, and hew him piecemeal —' more he would have said, but at the instant a bolt of lightning shot from the heavens, and lighting upon a large sycamore which shaded a part of the temple court, clove it in twain. The swollen cloud at the same moment burst, and a deluge of rain poured upon the city, the temple, the gazing multitudes, and the just kindled altars. The sacred fires went out in hissing and darkness; a tempest of wind whirled the limbs of the slaughtered victims into the air, and abroad over the neighboring streets. All was confusion, uproar, terror and dismay. The crowds sought safety in the houses of the nearest inhabitants, and the porches and of the palaces. Aurelian and the senators, and those nearest him, fled to the interior of the temple. The heavens blazed with the quick flashing of the lightning, and the temple itself seemed to rock beneath the voice of the thunder. I never knew in Rome so terrific a tempest. The stoutest trembled, for life hung by a thread. Great numbers, it has now been found, in every part of the capitol, fell a prey to the fiery bolts. The capitol itself was struck, and the brass statue of Vespasian in the forum thrown down and partly melted. The Tiber in a few hours overran its banks, and laid much of the city on its borders under water. But ere long the storm was over. The retreating clouds, but still sullenly muttering in the distance as they rolled away, were gaily lighted up by the sun, which again shone forth in his splendor. The scattered limbs of the victims were collected and again laid upon the altar. Dry wood being brought, the flames quickly shot upward and consumed to the last joint and bone the sacred offerings. Fronto once more stood before the altar, and now uninterrupted performed the last office of the ceremony. Then around the tables spread within the temple to the honor of the gods, feasting upon the luxuries contributed by every quarter of the earth, and filling high with wine, the adverse omens of the day were by most forgotten. But not by Aurelian. No smile was seen to light up his dark countenance. The jests of Varus and the wisdom of Porphyrius alike failed to reach him. Wrapped up in his own thoughts, he brooded gloomily over what had happened, and strove to read the interpretation of portents so unusual and alarming. I went not in to the feast, but returned home reflecting as I went upon the events I had witnessed. I knew not what to think. That in times past, long after the departure from the earth of Jesus and his immediate followers, the Deity had interposed in seasons of peculiar perplexity to the church, and in a way to be observed had manifested his power, I did not doubt. But for a long time such revelations had wholly ceased. And I could not see any such features in the present juncture, as would, to speak as a man, justify and vindicate a departure from the ordinary methods of the Divine Providence. But then on the other hand I could not otherwise account for the voice, nor discover any way in which, had one been so disposed, he could so successfully and securely have accomplished his work. Revolving these things, and perplexed by doubts, I reached the Cœlian — when, as I entered my dwelling, I found to my great satisfaction, Probus seated with Julia, who at an early period foreseeing the tempest had with Portia withdrawn to the security of her own roof. `I am glad you are come at length,' said Julia as I entered, `our friend has scarce spoken. I should think, did I not know the contrary, that he had suddenly abandoned the service of truth and become a disciple of Novatus. He hath done little but groan and sigh.' `Surely,' I replied, `the occasion warrants both sighs and groans. But when came you from the temple?' `On the appearance of the storm, just as Fronto approached the altar the first time. The signs were not to be mistaken by any who were not so much engrossed by the scene as to be insensible to all else, that a tempest was in the sky, and would soon break upon the crowds in a deluge of rain and hail — as has happened. So that warning Portia of the danger, we early retreated — she with reluctance — but for myself. I was glad to be driven away from a scene that brought so vividly before me the events of the early morning.' `I am glad it was so,' I replied; `you would have been more severely tried, had you remained.' And I then gave an account of the occurrences of the day. `I know not what to make of it,' she said as I ended. `Probus, teach us what to think. I am bewildered and amazed.' `Lady,' said Probus, `the Christian service is a hard one.' `I have not found it so, thus far, but on the other hand a light and easy one.' VOL. I. 10* `But the way is not ever so smooth, and the path once entered upon, there is no retreat.' `No roughness nor peril, Probus, be they what they may, can ever shake me. It is for eternity I have embraced this faith, not for time — for my soul, not for my body.' `God be thanked that it is so. But the evils and sorrows that time has in store, and which afflict the body, are not slight. And sometimes they burst forth from the overburdened clouds in terrific violence, and poor human strength sinks and trembles, as to-day before the conflict of the elements.' `They would find me strong in spirit and purpose, I am sure, Probus, however my woman's frame of flesh might yield. No fear can change my mind, nor tear me from the hopes which through Christ I cherish more, a thousand fold, than this life of an hour.' `Why, why is it so ordained in the Providence of God,' said Probus, `that truth must needs be watered with tears and blood, ere it will grow and bear fruit? When as now the sky is dark and threatening, and the mind is thronged with fearful anticipations of the sorrows that await those who hold this faith, how can I with a human heart within me labor to convert the unbelieving? The words falter upon my tongue. I turn from the young inquirer, and with some poor reason put him off to another season. When I preach, it is with a coldness that must repel, and it is that which I almost desire to be the effect. My prayers never reach heaven nor the consciences of those who hear. Probus, they say, is growing worldly. His heart burns no longer within him. His zeal is cold. We must look to Macer. I fear, lady, that the reproaches are well deserved. Not that I am growing worldly or cold, but that my human affections lead me away from duty, and make me a traitor to truth and my master.' `O no, Probus,' said Julia; `these are charges foolish and false. There is not a Christian in Rome but would say so. We all rest upon you.' `Then upon what a broken reed! I am glad it was not I who made you a Christian.' `Do you grieve to have been a benefactor? a redeemer? a savior?' `Almost, when I see the evils which are to overwhelm the believer. I look round upon my little flock of hearers, and I seem to see them led as lambs to the slaughter — poor, defenceless creatures, set upon by worse than lions and wolves. And you, lady of Piso, how can I sincerely rejoice that you have added your great name to our humble roll, when I think of what may await you. Is that form to be dragged with violence amid the hootings of the populace to the tribunal of the beast Varus? Are those limbs for the rack or the fire?' `I trust in God they are not, Probus. But if they are needed, they are little to give for that which has made me so rich and given wings to the soul. I can spare the body, now that the soul can live without it.' `There spoke the universal Christian! What but truth could so change our poor human nature into somewhat quite divine and godlike! Think not I shrink myself at the prospect of obstruction and assault. I am a man loose upon the world, weaned by suffering and misfortune from earth, and ready at any hour to depart from it. You know my early story. But I in vain seek to steel myself to the pains of others. I can bear, but I cannot behold. But from what I have said, I fear lest you should think me over-apprehensive. I wish it were so. But all seems at this moment to be against us.' `More then,' said Julia, `must have come to your ears than to ours. When last we sat with the emperor at his table, he seemed well inclined. And when urged by Fronto, rebuked him even with violence.' `Yes, it was so.' `Is it then from the scenes of to-day at the temple that you draw fresh omens of misfortune? I have asked you what we should think of them.' `I almost tremble to say. I stood, Piso, not far from you, upon the lower flight of steps, where I think you observed me.' `I did. And at the sound of that voice from the temple, methought your face was paler than Aurelian's. Why was that?' `Because, Piso, I knew the voice.' `Knew it! What mean you?' `Repeat it not — let it sink into your ear and there abide. It was Macer's.' `Macer's? Surely you jest.' `Alas! I wish it were a jest. But his tones were no more to be mistaken than were the thunder's.' `This, should it be known, would, it is plain to see, greatly exasperate Aurelian. It would be more than enough for Fronto to work his worst ends with. His suspicions at once fell upon the Christians.' `That,' said Probus, `was, I am confident, an artifice. The countenance struck with superstitious horror, is not to be read amiss. Seen though but for a moment, and the signature is upon it, one and unequivocal. But with quick instinct the wily priest saw his advantage, seized it, and, whether believing or not himself, succeeded in poisoning the mind of Aurelian and that of the multitude. So great was the commotion among the populace, that, but for the tempest, I believe scarce would the legions of the emperor have saved us from slaughter upon the spot. Honest, misguided Macer — little dost thou know how deep a wound thou hast struck into the very dearest life of the truth for which thou wouldst yet at any moment thyself freely suffer and die!' `What,' said Julia, `could have moved him to such madness?' `With him,' replied Probus, `it was a deed of piety and genuine zeal for God; he saw it in the light of an act god-like and god-directed. Could you read his heart you would find it calm and serene in the consciousness of a great duty greatly performed. It is very possible he may have felt himself to be but an instrument in the hand of a higher power, to whom he gives all the glory and the praise. There are many like him, lady, both among Christians and Pagans. The sybils impose not so much upon others as upon themselves. They who give forth the responses of the oracle, oft-times believe that they are in very truth full of the god, and speak not their own thoughts, but the inspirations of him whose priests they are. To themselves more than to others are they impostors. The conceit of the peculiar favor of God or of the gods in return for extraordinary devotion, is a weakness that besets our nature wherever it is found. An apostle perhaps never believed in his inspiration more firmly than at times does Macer, and others among us like him. But this inward solitary persuasion we know is nothing, however it may carry away captive the undiscriminating multitude.' `Hence, Probus, then I suppose the need of some outward act of an extraordinary nature to show the inspiration real.' `Yes,' he replied. `No assertion of divine impulses or revelations can avail to persuade us of their reality, except supported and confirmed by miracle. That, and that only, proves the present God. Christ would have died without followers had he exhibited to the world only his character and his truth, even though he had claimed, and claimed truly, a descent from and communion with the Deity. Men would have said, `This is an old and common story. We see every day and everywhere those who affect divine aid. No act is so easy as to deceive one's self. If you propose a spiritual moral system and claim for it a divine authority, show your authority by a divine work, a work impossible to man, and we will then admit your claims. But your own inward convictions alone, sincere as they may be and possibly founded in truth, pass with us for nothing. Raise one that was dead to life, and we will believe you when you reveal to us the spiritual world and the life to come.' `I think,' said Julia, `such would be the process in my own mind. There seems the same natural and necessary connection here between spiritual truths and outward acts, as between the forms of letters or the sound of words, and ideas. We receive the most subtle of Plato's reasonings through words — those miracles of material help — which address themselves to the eye or ear. So we receive the truths of Jesus through the eye witnessing his works or the ear hearing the voice from Heaven. — But we wander from Macer, in whom, from what you have told us and Piso has known, we both feel deeply interested. Can he not be drawn away from these fancies which possess him? 'T is a pity we should lose so strong an advocate, to some minds so resistless, nor only that, but suffer injury from his extravagance.' `It is our purpose,' I replied, `to visit him to try what effect earnest remonstrance and appeal may have. Soon as I shall return from my promised and now necessary visit to Marcus and Lucilia, I shall not fail, Probus, to request you to accompany me to his dwelling.' `Does he dwell far from us?' asked Julia. `His house, if house it may be called,' replied Probus, `is in a narrow street, which runs just behind the shop of Demetrius, midway between the Capitol and the Quirinal. It is easily found by first passing the shop and then descending quick to the left — the street Janus, our friend Isaac's street, turning off at the same point to the right. At Macer's, should your feet ever be drawn that way, you would see how and in what crowded space the poor live in Rome.' `Has he then a family, as your words seem to imply?' `He has; and one more lovely dwells not within the walls of Rome. In his wife and elder children, as I have informed Piso, we shall find warm and eloquent advocates on our side. They tremble for their husband and father, whom they reverence and love, knowing his impetuosity, his fearlessness and his zeal. Many an assault has he already brought upon himself, and is destined I fear to draw down many more and heavier.' `Heaven shield them all from harm,' said Julia. `Are they known to Demetrius? His is a benevolent heart, and he would rejoice to do them a service. No one is better known too or respected than the Roman Demetrius: his name merely would be a protection.' `It was from Macer,' replied Probus, `that Demetrius first heard the truth which now holds him captive. Their near neighborhood brought them often together. Demetrius was impressed by the ardor and evident sincerity so visible in the conversation and manners of Macer; and Macer was drawn toward Demetrius by the cast of melancholy — that sober, thoughtful air — that separates him so from his mercurial brother, and indeed from all. He wished he were a Christian. And by happy accidents being thrown together — or rather drawn by some secret bond of attraction — he in no long time had the happiness to see him one. From the hand of Felix he received the waters of baptism.' `What you have said, Probus, gives me great pleasure. I am not only now sure that Macer and his little tribe have a friend at hand, but the knowledge that such a mind as that of Demetrius has been wrought upon by Macer, has served to raise him in my esteem and respect. He can be no common man, and surely no madman.' `The world ever loves to charge those as mad,' said Probus, `who in devotion to a great cause exceed its cold standard of moderation. Singular, that excess in virtue should incur this reproach, while excess in vice is held but as a weakness of our nature!' We were here interrupted by Milo, who came to conduct us to the supper room; and there our friendly talk was prolonged far into the evening. When I next write I shall have somewhat to say of Marcus Lucilia and the little Gallus. How noble and generous in the queen, her magnificent gift! When summer comes round again I shall not fail together with Julia to see you there. How many recollections will come thronging upon me when I shall again find myself in the court of the Elephant sitting where I once sat so often and listened to the voice of Longinus. May you see there many happy years. Farewell. Nothing could exceed the sensation caused in Rome by the voice heard at the dedication, and among the adherents of the popular faith, by the unlucky omens of the day and of the sacrifice. My office at that time called me often to the capital, and to the palace of Aurerelian, and threw me frequently into his company and that of Livia. My presence was little heeded by the emperor, who, of a bold and manly temper, spoke out with little reserve and with no disguise or fear, whatever sentiments possessed him. From such opportunities and from communications of Menestheus the secretary of Aurelian, little took place at the palace which came not to my knowledge. The morning succeeding the dedication I had come to the city bringing a packet from the queen to the empress Livia. While I waited in the common reception room of the palace, Itook from a VOL. I. 11 case standing there, a roll and read. As I read, I presently was roused by the sound of Aurelian's voice. It was as if engaged in earnest conversation. He soon entered the apartment accompanied by the priest of the new temple. `There is something,' he said as he drew near, `in this combination of unlucky signs that might appal a stouter spirit than mine. This too, after a munificence toward not one only but all the temples, never I am sure surpassed. Every god has been propitiated by gifts and appropriate rites. How can all this be interpreted other than most darkly — other than as a general hostility — and a discouragement from an enterprise upon which I would found my glory. This has come most unlooked for. I confess myself perplexed. I have openly proclaimed my purpose — the word has gone abroad and travelled by this to the court of Persia itself, that with all Rome at my back I am once more to tempt the deserts of the East.' He here suddenly paused, being reminded by Fronto of my presence. `Ah, it matters not;' he said; `this is but Nichomachus, the good servant of the queen of Palmyra. I hope,' he said turning to me, `that the queen is well and the young Faustula?' `They are well,' I replied. `How agree with her these coo'er airs of the west? These are not the breezes of Arabia, that come to-day from the mountains.' `She heeds them little,' I replied, `her thoughts are engrossed by heavier cares.' `They must be fewer now than ever.' `They are fewer, but they are heavier and weigh upon her life more than the whole East once did. The remembrance of a single great disaster weights as a heavier burden than the successful management of an empire.' `True, Nichomachus, that is over true.' Then without further regarding me he went on with his conversation with Fronto. `I cannot,' he said, `now go back; and to go forward may be presumptuous.' `I cannot but believe, great emperor,' said Fronto, `that I have it in my power to resolve your doubts, and set your mind at ease.' `Rest not then,' said Aurelian with impatience — `but say on.' `You sought the gods and read the omens with but one prayer and thought. And you have construed them as all bearing upon one point and having one significancy — because you have looked in no other direction. I believe they bear upon a different point, and that when you look behind and before, you will be of the same judgment.' `Whither tends all this?' `To this — that the omens of the day bear not upon your eastern expedition, but upon the new religion! You are warned as the great high priest, by these signs in heaven and on earth — not against this projected expedition, which is an act of piety, if a warlike expedition ever may be termed so — but against this accursed superstition which is working its way into the empire and threatening the extermination and overthrow of the very altars on which you laid your costly offerings. What concern can the divinities feel in the array of an army compared with that which must agitate their sacred breasts as they behold their altars cast down or forsaken, their names profaned, their very being denied, their worshippers drawn from them to the secret midnight orgies of a tribe of Atheists, whose aim is anarchy in the state and in religion; owning neither king on earth nor king in heaven — every man to be his own priest — every man his own master! Is not this the likeliest reading of the omens?' `I confess, Fronto,' the emperor replied, the cloud upon his brow clearing away as he spoke, `that what you say possesses likelihood. I believe I have interpreted according to my fears. It is as you say — the East only has been in my thoughts. It cannot in reason be thought to be this enterprize, which as you have said is an act of piety, all Rome would judge it so — against which the heavens have thus arrayed themselves. Fronto! Fronto! I am another man! Slave,' cried he aloud to one of the menials as he passed, `let Mucapor be instantly summoned. Let there be no delay. Now can my affairs be set on with something more of speed. When the gods smile mountains sink to mole-hills. A divine energy runs in the current of the blood and lends more than mortal force to the arm and the will.' As he spoke, never did so malignant a joy light up the human countenance as was to be seen in the face of Fronto. `And what then,' he hastily put in as the emperor paused, `what shall be done with these profane wretches?' `The Christians! They must be seen to. I will consider. Now, Fronto, shall I fill to the brim the cup of human glory. Now shall Rome by me vindicate her lost honor and wipe off the foulest stain that since the time of Romulus has darkened her annals.' `You will do yourself and the empire immortal honor. If danger ever threatened the very existence of the state it is now from the secret machinations of this god-denying tribe.' `I spake of the East and of Valerian, Fronto. Syria is now Rome's. Palmyra, that mushroom of a day, is level with the ground. Her life is out. She will be hereafter known but by the fame of her past greatness, of her matchless queen, and the glory of the victories that crowned the arms of Aurelian. What now remains but Persia?' `The Christians,' said the priest, shortly and bitterly. `You are right, Fronto; the omens are not to be read otherwise. It is against them they point. It shall be maturely weighed what shall be done. When Persia is swept from the field and Ctesiphon lies as low as Palmyra, then will I restore the honor of the gods, and let who will dare to worship other than as I shall ordain! Whoever worships them not, or other than them, shall die.' `In that spoke the chief minister of religion — the representative of the gods. The piety of Aurelian is in the mouths of men not less than his glory. The city resounds with the praise of him who has enriched the temples, erected new ones, made new provision for the priesthood, and fed the poor. This is the best greatness. Posterity will rather honor and remember him who saved them their faith, than him who gained a Persian victory. The victory for Religion too is to be had VOL. I. 11* without cost, without a step taken from the palace gate, or from the side of her who is alike Aurelian's and the empire's boast.' `Nay, nay, Fronto, you are over-zealous. This eastern purpose admits not of delay. Hormisdas is new in his power. The people are restless and divided. The present is the moment of success. It cannot bear delay. To-morrow, could it be so, would I start for Thrace. The heavens are propitious. They frown no longer.' `The likliest way methinks,' replied the priest, `to insure success and the continued favor of the gods in that which they do not forbid, were first to fulfill their commands in what they have enjoined.' `That, Fronto, cannot be denied. It is of weight. But where of two commands both seem alike urgent, and both cannot be done at once, whether we will or not, we must choose, and in choosing we may err.' `To an impartial, pious mind, O emperor, the god of thy worship never shone more clear in the heavens than shines his will in the terrific signs of yesterday. Forgive thy servant, but drawn as thou art by the image of fresh laurels of victory to be bound about thy brow, of the rich spoils of Persia, of its mighty monarch at thy chariot wheels, and the long line of a new triumph sweeping through the gates and the great heart of the capital, — and thou art blind to the will of the gods, though writ in the dread convulsions of the elements and the unerring language of the slaughtered victims.' `Both may be done — both, Fronto. I blame not your zeal. Your freedom pleases me. Religion is thus, I know, in good hands. But both I say may be done. The care of the empire in this its other part may be left to thee and Varus, with full powers to see that the state in the matter of its faith receives no harm. Your knowledge in this, if not your zeal, is more than mine. While I meet the enemies of Rome abroad, you shall be my other self and gain other victories at home.' `Little, I fear, Aurelian, could be done even by me and Varus leagued, with full delegated powers, opposed as we should be by Tacitus and the senate and the best half of Rome. None but an arm omnipotent as thine can crush this mischief. I see thou knowest not how deep it has struck nor how wide it has spread. The very foundations of the throne and the empire are undermined. The poison of Christian atheism has infected the whole mind of the people, not only throughout Rome, but Italy, Gaul, Africa, and Asia. And for this we have to thank whom? Whom but ourselves? Ever since Hadrian — otherwise a patriot king — built his imageless temples, in imitation of this barren and lifeless worship; ever since the weak Alexander and his superstitious mother filled the imperial palace with their statues of Christ, with preachers and teachers of his religion; ever since the Philips openly and without shame professed his faith; ever, I say, since these great examples have been before the world, has the ancient religion declined its head, and the new stalked proudly by. Let not Aurelian's name be added to this fatal list. Let him first secure the honor of the gods — then, and not till then, seek his own.' `You urge with warmth, Fronto, and with reason too. Your words are not wasted; they have fallen where they shall be deeply pondered. In the meantime I will wait for the judgment of the augurs and haruspices; and as the colleges report, will hold myself bound so to act.' So they conversed, and then passed on. I was at that time but little conversant with the religious condition of the empire. I knew but little of the character of the prevailing faith and the Pagan priesthood; and I knew less of the new religion as it was termed. But the instincts of my heart were from the gods, and they were all for humanity. I loved man, whoever he was and of whatever name or faith; and I sickened at cruelties perpetrated against him both in war and by the bloody spirit of superstition. I burned with indignation therefore as I listened to the cold-blooded arguings of the bigoted priest, and wept to see how artfully he could warp aside the better nature of Aurelian, and pour his own venom into veins that had else run with human blood, at least not the poisoned current of tigers, wolves, and serpents of every name and nature most vile. My hope was that, away from his prompter, and the first purpose of Aurelian would return and have its way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER V. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. I am now returned from my long intended visit to the villa of Marcus, and have much to say concerning it. But first of all rejoice with me in a fresh demonstration of good will on the part of Aurelian towards Zenobia. And what think you it is? Nothing less than this, that Vabalathus has been made by Aurelian and the senate king of Armenia! The kingdom is not large, but large enough for him at his present age — if he shall show himself competent, additions doubtless will be made. Our only regret is, that the queen loses thus his presence with her at Tibur. He had become to his mother all that a son should be. Not that in respect to native force he could ever make good the loss of Julia, or even of Livia, but that in all the many offices which an affectionate child would render to a parent in the changed circumstances of Zenobia, he has proved to be a solace and a support. The second day from the dedication, passing through the Porta Asinaria with Milo at my side, I took the road that winds along the hither bank of the Tiber, and leads most pleasantly, if not most directly, to the seat of my friends — and you are well aware how willingly I sacrifice a little time on the way, if by doing so I can more than make up the loss by obtaining brighter glimpses of earth and sky. Had I not found Christianity, Fausta, this would have been my religion. I should have forsaken the philosophers and gone forth into the fields among the eternal hills, upon the banks of the river, or the margin of the ever-flowing ocean, and in the lessons there silently read to me, I should I think have arrived at some very firm and comfortable faith in God and immortality. And I am especially happy in this, that nature in no way loses its interest or value, because I now draw truth from a more certain source. I take the same pleasure as before in observing and contemplating her various forms, and the clearer light of Christianity brings to view a thousand beauties, to which before I was insensible. Just as in reading a difficult author, although you may have reached his sense in some good degree, unaided, yet a judicious commentator points out excellences, and unfolds truths, which you had either wholly overlooked or but imperfectly comprehended. All without the city walls, as within, bore witness to the graciousness of the emperor in the prolonged holiday he had granted the people. It was as if the Saturnalia had arrived. Industry, such as there ever is, was suspended; all were sitting idle, or thronging some game, or gathering in noisy groups about some mountebank. As we advanced farther and came just beyond the great road leading to Tibur, we passed the school of the celebrated gladiator Sosia, at the door of which there had just arrived from the amphitheatre a cart bearing home the bodies of such as had been slain the preceding day, presenting a disgusting spectacle of wounds, bruises, and flowing blood. `There was brave fighting yesterday,' said Milo; `these are but a few out of all that fell. The first day's sport was an hundred of the trained gladiators, most of them from the school of Sosia, set against a hundred picked captives of all nations. Not less than a half of each number got it. These fellows look as if they had done their best. You 've fought your last battle, old boys — unless you have a bout with Charon, who will be loath, I warrant you beforehand, to ferry over such a slashed and swollen company. Now ought you in charity,' he continued, addressing a half-naked savage who was helping to drag the bodies from the cart, `to have these trunks well washed ere you bury them, or pitch them into the Tiber, else they will never get over the Styx — not forgetting too the ferriage —' what more folly he would have uttered I know not, for the wretch to whom he spoke suddenly seized the lash of the driver of the cart and laid it over Milo's shoulders, saying, as he did it, `Off, fool, or my fist shall do for you what it did for one of these.' The bystanders at this set up a hoarse shouting, one of them exclaiming so that I could hear him — `There goes the Christian Piso, we or the lions will have a turn at him yet. These are the fellows that spoil our trade.' `Never mind,' replied another, `if report goes true they won't spoil it long.' No rank and no power is secure against the affronts of this lawless tribe; they are a sort of licensed brawlers, their brutal and inhuman trade rendering them insensible to all fear from any quarter. Death is to them but as a scratch on the finger — they care not for it when nor how it comes. The slightest cause — a passing word — a look — a motion — is enough to inflame their ferocious passions, and bring on quarrel and murder. Riot and death are daily occurrences in the neighborhood of these schools of trained assassins. Milo knew their character well enough, but he deemed himself to be uttering somewhat that should amuse rather than enrage, and was mortified rather than terrified, I believe, at the sudden application of the lash. The unfeigned surprise he manifested, together with the quick leap which his horse made, who partook of the blow, was irresistibly ludicrous. He was nearly thrown off backwards in the speed of his horse's flight along the road. It was some time before I overtook him. `Intermeddling,' I said to Milo as I came up with him, `is a dangerous vice. How feel your shoulders?' `I shall remember that one-eyed butcher, and if there be virtue in hisses or in thumbs, he shall rue the hour he laid a lash on Gallienus. Poor fellow! Whose horsemanship is equal to such an onset? I 'll haunt the theatre till my chance come.' `Well, well, let us forget this. How went the games yesterday?' `Never, as I hear,' he said, `and as I remember, were they more liberal, or more magnificent. Larger, or more beautiful, or finer beasts, neither Asia nor Africa ever sent over. They fought as if they had been trained to it, like these scholars of Sosia, and in most cases they bore away the palm from them. How many of Sosia's men exactly fell, it is not known, but not fewer than threescore men were either torn in pieces, or rescued too much lacerated to fight more.' `What captives were sacrificed?' `I did not learn of what nation they were, nor how many. All I know is what I witnessed toward the end of the sport. Never before did I behold such a form, nor such feats of strength! He was another Hercules. It was rumored he was from the forests of Germany. If you will believe it, which I scarce can though I saw it, he fought successively with six of Sosia's best men, and one after another laid them all sprawling. A seventh was then set upon him, he having no time to breathe or even drink. Many however cried out against this. But Romans, you know, like not to have their fun spoiled, so the seventh was not taken off. As every one foresaw, this was too much by just one for the hero; but he fought desperately, and it is believed Sosia's man got pushes he will never recover from. He was soon however on his knees, and then on his back, the sword of his antagonist at his throat, he lying like a gasping fish at his mercy — who waited the pleasure of the spectators a moment, before he struck. Then was there a great shouting all over the theatre in his behalf, besides making the sign to spare him. But just at the moment, as for him ill fortune would have it, some poltroon cried out with a voice that went all over the theatre, `The dog is a Christian!' Whereupon like lightning every thumb went up, and down plunged the sword into his neck. So, master, thou seest what I tell thee every day, there is small virtue in being a Christian. It is every way dangerous. If a thief runs through the streets the cry is, a Christian! a Christian! If a man is murdered, they who did it accuse some neighboring Christian, and he dies for it. If a Christian fall into the Tiber, men look on as on a drowning dog. If he slip or fall in a VOL. I. 12 crowd, they will help trample him to death. If he is sick or poor, none but his own tribe will help him. Even the Jew despises him, and spits upon his gown as he passes. What but the love of contempt and death can make one a Christian 'tis hard to see. Had that captive been other than a Christian he would not have fallen as he did.' `Very likely. But the Christians you know frequent not the amphitheatre. Had they been there in their just proportion to the rest, the voice would at least have been a divided one.' `Nay, as for that,' he rejoined, `there were some stout voices raised in his behalf to the last, and some thumbs down, but too few to be regarded. But even in the streets, where all sorts are found, there is none to take the Christian's part — unless it be that old gashed soldier of the fifth legion, who stalks through the streets as though all Rome were his. By the gods, I believe he would beard Aurelian himself! He will stand at a corner, in some public place, and preach to the crowds, and give never an inch for all their curses and noise. They fear him too much I believe to attack him with aught but words. And I wonder not at it. A few days since a large dog was in wicked wantonness, as I must allow, set upon a poor Christian boy. Macer, so he is called about the city, at the moment came up. Never tiger seized his prey as he seized that dog, and first dashing out his brains upon the pavement, pursued then the pursuers of the boy and beat them to jelly with the carcase of the beast, and then walked away unmolested, leading the child to his home.' `Men reverence courage, Milo, everywhere and in all.' `That do they. It was so with me once when Gallienus —' `Gallop, Milo, to that mile-stone, and report to me how far we have come.' I still as ever extract much, Fausta, from my faithful if foolish slave. In due time and without hindrance or accident I reached the outer gate of my friend's villa. The gate was opened by Cœlia, whose husband is promoted to the place of porter. Her face shone as she saw me, and she hastened to assure me that all were well at the house, holding up at the same moment a curly-headed boy for me to admire, whom with a blush and a faltering tongue she called Lucius. I told her I was pleased with the name, for it was a good one, and he should not suffer for bearing it, if I could help it. Milo thought it unlucky enough that it should be named after a Christian, and I am certain has taken occasion to remonstrate with its mother on the subject; but, as you may suppose, did not succeed in infusing his own terrors. I was first met by Lucilia, who received me with her usual heartiness. Marcus was out on some remote part of the estate overseeing his slaves. In a few moments, by the assiduous Lucilia and her slaves, I was brushed and washed and set down to a table — though it was so few hours since I had left Rome — covered with bread, honey, butter and olives, a cold capon with salads, and wine such as the cellars of Marcus alone can furnish. As the only way in which to keep the good opinion of Lucilia is to eat, I ate of all that was on the table, she assuring me that everything was from their own grounds — the butter made by her own hands — and that I might search Rome in vain for better. This I readily admitted. Indeed no butter is like hers — so yellow and so hard — nor bread so light and so white. Even her honey is more delicious than what I find elsewhere, the bees knowing by instinct who they are working for; and the poultry is fatter and tenderer, the hens being careful never to over-fatigue themselves, and the peacocks and the geese not to exhaust themselves in screaming and cackling. All nature, alive and dead, takes upon itself a trimmer and more perfect seeming within her influences. I had sat thus gossipping with Lucilia, enjoying the balmy breezes of a warm autumn day as they drew through the great hall of the house, when, preceded by the bounding Gallus, the master of the house entered in field dress of broad sun-hat, open neck, close coat depending to the knees, and boots that brought home with them the spoils of many a well-ploughed field. `Well, sir Christian,' he cried, `I joy to see thee, although thus recreant. But how is it that thou lookest as ever before? Are not these vanities of silk, and gold, and fine clothes renounced by those of the new religion? Your appearance says nay, and, by Jupiter! wine has been drunk already! Nay, nay, Lucilia, it was hardly a pagan act to tempt our strict friend with that Falernian.' `Faleruian is it?' `Yes, of the vintage of the fourth of Gallienus. Delicious, was it not? But by and by thou shalt taste something better than that — as much better as that is than anything of the same name thou didst ever raise to thy lips at the table of Aurelian. Piso! never was a face more welcome! Not a soul has looked in upon us for days and days. Not, Lucilia, since the Kalends, when young Flaccus with a boat-load of roysterers dropt down the river. But why comes not Julia too? She could not leave the games and theatres, hah?' `Marcus,' said Lucilia, `you forget it was the princess who first seduced Lucius. But for that eastern voyage for the Persian Calpurnius, Piso would have been still, I dare say, what his parents made him. Let us not yet however stir this topic; but first of all, Lucius, give us the city news. How went the dedication? we have heard strange tales.' `How went it by report?' I asked. `O, it would be long telling,' said Lucilia. `Only for one thing, we heard that there was a massacre of the Christians, in which some said hundreds, and some, thousands fell. For a moment, I assure you, we trembled for you. The confirmation afforded by your actual presence, of your welfare, is not unwelcome. You must lay a part of the heartiness of our reception, especially the old Falernian to the account of our relieved fears. But let us hear.' I then went over the last days in Rome, adding what I had been able to gather from Milo, when it was such that I could trust to it. When I had satisfied their curiosity, and had moreover described to Lucilia the dresses of Livia on so great an occasion, and the fashions which were raging, Marcus proposed that I should accompany him over his farm, and observe his additions and improvements, and the condition of his slaves. I accepted the proposal with pleasure, and we soon set forth on our ramble, accompanied by Gallus, now riding his stick and now gambolling about the lawns and fields with his dog. I like this retreat of Curtius better almost than any VOL. I. 12* other of the suburban villas of our citizens. There is an air of calm senatorial dignity about it which modern edifices want. It looks as if it had seen more than one generation of patrician inhabitants. There is little unity or order — as those words are commonly understood — observable in the structure of the house, but it presents to the eye an irregular assemblage of forms, the work of different ages, and built according to the taste and skill of distant times. Some portions are new, some old and covered with lichens, mosses, and creeping plants. Here is a portico of the time of Trajan, and there a tower that seems as if it were of the times of the republic. Yet is there a certain harmony and congruity running through the whole, for the material used is everywhere the same — a certain fawn-colored stone drawn from quarries still existing in the neighborhood — and each successive owner and architect has evidently paid some regard to preceding erections in the design and proportions of the part he has added. In this unity of character as well as in the separate beauty or greatness of distinct parts is it made evident that persons of accomplishment and rank have alone possessed it. Of its earlier history all that Curtius has with certainty ascertained is, that it was once the seat of the great Hortensius — before he had in the growth of his fame and his riches displayed his luxurious tastes in the wonders of Tusculum, Bauli, or Laurentum. It was the first indication given by him of that love of elegant and lavish wastefulness, that gave him at last as wide a celebrity as his genius. The part which he built is well known, and although of moderate dimensions, yet displays the rudiments of that taste that afterward was satisfied only with more than imperial magnificence. Marcus has satisfied himself as to the very room which he occupied as his study and library, and where he prepared himself for the morning courts; and in the same apartment — hoping as he says to catch something from the genius of the place — does he apply himself to the same professional labors. His name and repute are now second to none in Rome. Yet, young as he is, he begins to weary of the bar and woo the more quiet pursuits of letters and philosophy. Nay, at the present moment agriculture claims all his leisure, and steals time that can ill be spared from his clients. Varro and Cato have more of his devotion than statutes and precedents. In the disposition of the grounds, Marcus has shown that he inherits something of the tastefulness of his remote predecessor; and in the harvest that covers his extensive acres, gives equal evidence that he has studied not without profit the labors of those who have written upon husbandry and its connected arts. Varro especially is at his tongue's end. We soon came to the quarter of the slaves — a village almost of the humble tenements occupied by this miserable class. None but the women, children, sick and aged, were now at home — the young and able-bodied being abroad at work. No new disturbances have broken out, he tells me; the former severity, followed by a well-timed lenity, having subdued or conciliated all. Curtius, although fond of power and of all its ensigns, yet conceals not his hatred of this institution, which has so long obtained in the Roman state, as in all states. He can devise no way of escape from it; but he sees in it the most active and general cause of the corruption of morals which is spread everywhere where it prevails. He cannot suppress his contempt of the delusion or hypocrisy of our ancestors in terming themselves republicans. `What a monstrous solecism was it,' he broke out with energy, `in the times preceding the empire, to call that a free country which was built upon the degradation and slavery of half of its population. Rome never was a republic. It was simply a faction of land and slave holders, who blinded and befooled the ignorant populace by parading before them some of the forms of liberty, but kept the power in their own hands. They were a community of petty kings, which was better in their mind than only one king as in the time of the Tarquins. It was a republic of kingdoms and of kings, if you will. Now and then indeed the people bustled about and shook their chains as in the times of the institution of the tribune's office and those of the Gracchi. But they gained nothing. The patricians were still the kings who ruled them. And among no people can there be liberty where slavery exists — liberty I mean properly so called. He who holds slaves cannot in the nature of things be a republican; but in the nature of things he is on the other hand a despot. I am one. And a nation of such individuals is an association of despots for despotic purposes, and nothing else nor better. Liberty in their mouths is a profanation of the sacred name. It signifies nothing but their liberty to reign. I confess it is to those who happen to be the kings a very agreeable state of things. I enjoy my power and state mightily. But I am not blind to the fact — my own experience teaches it — that it is a state of things corrupt and rotten to the heart — destructive everywhere of the highest form of the human character. It nurses and brings out the animal, represses and embrutes the god that is within us. It makes of man a being of violence, force, passion, and the narrowest selfishness; while reason and humanity, which should distinguish him, are degraded or annihilated. Such men are not the stuff that republics are made of. A republic may endure for a time in spite of them, owing to fortunate circumstances of another kind; but wherever they obtain a preponderance in the state, liberty will expire, or exist only in the insulting forms in which she waved her bloody sceptre during most of our early history. Slavery and despotism are natural allies.' `I rejoice,' I said, `to find a change in you, at least in the theory which you adopt.' `I certainly am changed,' he replied; `and such as the change may be, is it owing, sir Christian, to thy calm and yet fiery epistles from Palmyra. Small thanks do I owe thee for making me uncomfortable in a position from which I cannot escape. Once proud of my slaves and my power, I am already ashamed of both; but while my principles have altered, my habits and character, which slavery has created and nursed, remain beyond any power of man, so far as I can see, to change them. What they are you well know. So that here in my middle age I suffer a retribution that should have been reserved till I had been dismissed from the dread tribunal of Rhadamanthus.' `I see not, Curtius, why you should not escape from the position you are in, if you sincerely desire it, which I suppose you do not.' `That, to be honest — which at least I am — is I believe the case.' `I do not doubt it, as it is with all who are situated like yourself. Most, however, defend the principle as well as cling to the form of slavery.' `Nay, that I cannot do. That I never did, since my beard was grown. I fancy myself to have from the gods a good heart. He is essentially of a corrupt heart who will stand for slavery in its principle. He is without anything generous in his nature. Cold selfishness marks and makes him. But supposing I as sincerely desired to escape — as I sincerely do not — what, O most wise mentor, should be the manner?' `First and at once, to treat them no longer as slaves, but as men.' `That I am just beginning to do. What else?' `If you are sincere as I say, and moreover if you possess the exalted and generous traits which we patricians ever claim for ourselves, show it them by giving their freedom one by one to those who are now slaves, even though it result in the loss of one half of your fortune. That will be a patrician act. What was begun in crime by others, cannot be perpetuated without equal crime in us. The enfranchised will soon mingle with the people, and, as we see every day, become one with it. This process is going on at this moment in all my estates. Before my will is executed, I shall hope to have disposed in this manner of every slave in my possession.' `One can hardly look to emulate such virtues as this new-found Christian philosophy seems to have engendered within thy noble bosom, Piso; but the subject must be weighed. There is nothing so agreeable in prospect as to do right; but, like some distant stretches of land and hill, water and wood, the beauty is all gone as it draws near. It is then absolutely a source of pain and disgust. I will write a treatise upon the great theme.' `If you write, Curtius, I shall despair of any action. all your philanthropy will evaporate in a cloud of words.' `But that will be the way, I think, to restore my equanimity. I believe I shall feel quite easy after a little declamation. Here, Lucius, regale thyself upon these grapes. These are from the isles of the Grecian Archipelago, and for sweetness are not equalled by any of our own. Gallus, Gallus, go not so near to the edge of the pond; it is deep, as I have warned you. I have lampreys there, Piso, bigger than any that Hortensius ever wept for. Gallus, you dog! away, I say.' But Gallus heeded not the command of his father. He already was beginning to have a little will of his own. He continued playing upon the margin of the water, throwing in sticks for his dog to bring to him again. Perceiving his danger to be great, I went to him and forcibly drew him away, he and his dog setting up a frightful music of screams and yelpings. Marcus was both entertained and amazed at the feat. `Piso,' he jocosely cried out, `there is a good deal of the old republican in you. You even treat free men as slaves. That boy — a man in will — never had before such restraint laid upon his liberty.' `Liberty with restraint,' I answered, `operating upon all, and equally upon all, is the true account of a state of freedom. Gallus unrestrained is a slave — a slave of passion and the sport of chance. He is not truly free until he is bound.' With such talk we amused ourselves as we wandered over the estate, through its more wild and more cultivated parts. Dinner was presently announced by a slave sounding at a distance a sort of sea-shell, and we hastened to the house. Lucilia awaited us in a small six-sided cabinet, fitted up purposely for a dining-room for six or eight persons. It was wholly cased with a rich marble of a pale yellow hue, beautifully panelled, having three windows opening upon a long portico with a southern aspect, set out with exotics in fancifully arranged groups. The marble panels of the room were so contrived that at a touch they slipped aside and disclosed in rich array, here the choicest wines, there sauces and spices of a thousand sorts, and there again the rarest confections brought from China and the East. Apicius himself could have fancied nothing more perfect — for the least dissatisfaction with the flavor of a dish, or the kind of wine, could be removed by merely reaching out the hand and drawing from an inexhaustible treasure-house both wines and condiments, such as scarce Rome itself could equal. This was an apartment contrived and built by Hortensius himself. The dinner was worthy the room and its builder, the marbles, the prospect, the guest, the host, and the hostess. The aforementioned Apicius would have never once thought of the panelled cupboards. No dish would have admitted of addition or alteration. When the feasting was over, and with it the lighter conversation and more disjointed and various which usually accompanies it, Marcus rose, and withdrawing one of the sliding panels, with much gravity and state drew forth a glass pitcher of exquisite form filled with wine, saying as he did so, `All, Piso, that you have as yet tasted is but as water of the Tiber to this. This is more than nectar. The gods have never been so happy as to have seen the like. I am their envy. It is Falernian, that once saw the wine vaults of Heliogabalus! Not a drop of Chian has ever touched it. It is pure, unadulterate. Taste and be translated.' I acknowledged, as I well might, its unequalled flavor. `This nectarean draught,' he continued, `I even consider to possess purifying and exalting qualities. He who drinks it is for the time of a higher nature. It is better for the temper than a chapter of Seneca or Epictetus. It brings upon the soul a certain divine calm, favorable beyond any other state to the growth of the virtues. Could it become of universal use, mankind were soon a race of gods. Even Christianity were then made unnecessary — admitting it to be that unrivalled moral engine which you Christians affirm it to be. It is favorable also to dispassionate discussion, Piso, a little of which I would now invite. Know you not, I have scarce seen you since your assumption of your new name and faith? What bad demon possessed you, in evil hour, to throw Rome and your friends into such a ferment?' `Had you become, Lucius,' said Lucilia, `a declaiming advocate of Epicurus, or a street-lecturer upon Plato, or turned priest of Apollo's new temple, it would VOL. I. 13 have all been quite tolerable, though amazing — but Christian!' — `Yes, Lucius, it is too bad,' added Marcus. `If you were in want of moral strength, you would have done better to have begged some of my Falernian. You should not have been denied.' `Or,' said Lucilia, `some of my Smyrna cordial.' `At least,' continued Marcus, `you might have come to me for some of my wisdom which I keep ready at a moment's warning in quantities to suit all applicants.' `Or to me,' said Lucilia, `for some of my every day good-sense which you know I possess in such abundance, though I have not sat at the feet of philosophers.' `But seriously, Lucius,' began Marcus in altered mood, `this is a most extraordinary movement of yours. I should like to be able to interpret it. If you must needs have what you call religion, of which I for my part can see no earthly occasion, here were plenty of forms in which to receive it, more ancient and more respectable than this of the Christians.' `I am almost unwilling to converse on this topic with you, Marcus,' I rejoined, `for there is nothing in your nature, or rather in your educated nature, to which to appeal with the least hope of any profitable result either to me or you. The gods have, as you say, given you a good heart — I may add too, a most noble head; but yourself and education together have made you so thoroughly a man of the world, that the interests of any other part of your nature, save those of the intellect and the senses, are to you precisely as if they did not exist.' `Right, Lucius; therein do I claim honor and distinction. The intangible, the invisible, the vague, the shadowy I leave to women and priests — concerning myself only with the substantial realities of life. Great Jupiter! what would become of mankind were we all women and priests? How could the courts go on — senates sit and deliberate — armies conquer? I think the world would stand still. However, I object not to a popular faith, such as that which now obtains throughout the Roman world. If mankind, as history seems to prove, must and will have something of the kind, this perhaps is as good as anything else; and seeing it has once become established and fixed in the way it has, I think it ought no more to be disturbed than men's faith in their political institutions. Our concern should be merely to regulate it, that it grow not too large and so overlay and crush the state. Fanatics and bigots must be hewn away. There must be an occasional infusion of doubt and indifference into the mass to keep it from fermenting. You cannot be offended, Lucius, at the way in which I speak of your new-adopted faith. I think no better of any other. Epicureans, Stoics, Platonists, Jews, Christians, they are all alike to me. I hold them all at arms length. I have listened to them all; and more idle indigested fancies never did I hear — no, not from the newest-fledged advocate playing the rhetorician at his first appearance.' `I do not wonder, Curtius, that you have turned away dissatisfied with the philosophers. I do not wonder that you reject the popular superstitions. But I do wonder that you will prejudge any question, or infer the intrinsic incredibility of whatever may take the form of religion, from the intrinsic incredibility of what the world has heretofore possessed. It surely is not a philosophical method.' `Not in other things, I grant,' replied Marcus; `but concerning this question of popular superstition, or religion, the only philosophy is to discard the whole subject as one deserving severe investigation. The follies which the populace have in all nations and in all time adopted, let them be retained, and even defended and supported by the state. They perform a not unimportant office in regulating the conduct and manners of men — in preserving a certain order in the world. But beyond this, it seems to me the subject is unworthy the regard of a reflecting person. One world and one life is enough to manage at a time. If there be another, or if there be a God who governs it and this also, it will be time enough to know these things when they are made plain to the senses, as these trees and hills now are and your well-shaped form. This peering into futurity in the expectation to arrive at certainty, seems to me much as if one should hope to make out the forms of cities, palaces and groves by gazing into the empty air or on the clouds. Besides, of what use?' `Of what use indeed?' added Lucilia. `I want no director nor monitor concerning any duty or act which it falls to me to perform other than I find within me. I have no need of a divine messenger to stand ever at my side to tell me what I must do and what I must forbear. I have within me instincts and impulses which I find amply sufficient. The care and duty of every day is very much alike, and a little experience and observation added to the inward instinct makes me quite superior to most difficulties and evils as they arise. The gods, or whatever power gave us our nature, have not left us dependent either on what is called religion or philosophy.' `What you say,' I rejoined, `is partly true. The gods have not left us dependent upon either religion or philosophy. There is a natural religion of the heart and the conscience which is born with us, grows up with us, and never forsakes us. But then after all how defective and incomplete a principle it is. It has chiefly to to do only with our daily conduct; it cannot answer our doubts or satisfy our wants. It differs too with the constitution of the individual. In some it is a principle of much greater value and efficacy than in others. Your instincts are clear and powerful and direct you aright. But in another they are obscure and weak, and leave the mind in the greatest perplexity. It is by no means all that they want. Then are not the prevalent superstitions most injurious in their influences upon the common mind? Can you doubt whether more of good or evil is derived to the soul from the ideas it entertains of the character and providence of the gods? Can you be insensible to the horrible enormities and nameless vices which make a part even of what is called religion? And is there no need — if men will have religion in some form — that they should receive it in a better one? Can you not conceive of such views of God and his worship, of duty, virtue, and immortality being presented, that they shall strike the mind as reasonable in themselves and of beneficial instead of hurtful power upon being adopted? Can you not imagine your own mind and the minds of people generally to be so devoted to a high and sublime conception of the Divinity and of futurity, as to be absolutely incapable of an act that should displease him or forfeit the hope of immortality?' VOL. I. 13* `Hardly,' said Marcus and Lucilia. `Well, suppose it were so. Or rather, if you cannot imagine such a state of things, multitudes can. You are not a fair specimen of our kind, but only of a comparatively small class. Generally — so I have found it — the mind is seeking about for something better than what any human system has as yet proposed, and is confident of nothing more than of this, that men may be put in possession of truths that shall carry them on as far beyond what their natural instincts now can do, as these instincts carry them on beyond any point to which the brutes ever arrive. This certainly was my own conviction before I met with Christianity. Now Marcus and Lucilia, what is this Christianity but a revelation from Heaven whose aim is to give to you and to all such conceptions of God and futurity, as I have just spoken of?' — I then, finding that I had obtained a hearing, went into a full account of the religion of Christ as I had received it from the books themselves, and which to you I need not repeat. They listened with considerable patience — though I was careful not to use many words — but without any expression of countenance or manner that indicated any very favorable change in their opinions or feelings. As I ended, Marcus said, `I shall always think better of this religion, Lucius, that you have adopted it, though I cannot say that your adopting it will raise my judgment of you. I do not at present see upon what grounds it stands so firm or divine that a citizen is defensible in abandoning for it an ostensible reception of and faith in the existing forms of the state. However, I incline to allow freedom in these matters to scholars and speculative minds. Let them work out and enjoy their own fancies — they are a restless, discontented, ambitious herd, and should, for the sake of their genius, be humored in the particular pursuits where they have placed their happiness. But when they turn propagators and reformers, and aim at the subversion of things now firmly established and prosperous, then — although I myself should never meddle in such matters — it is scarcely a question whether the power of the state should interpose and lay upon them the necessary restraints. Upon the whole, Lucius Piso, I think that I and Lucilia had better turn preachers, and exhort you to return to the faith or no-faith which you have abandoned. Leave such things to take care of themselves. What have you gained but making yourself an object of popular aversion or distrust? You have abandoned the community of the polite, the refined, the sober, where by nature you belong, and have associated yourself with a vulgar crew of — forgive my freedom, I speak the common judgment that you may know what it is — ignorant fanatics or crafty knaves, who care for you no further than as by your great name they may stand a little higher in the world. I protest before Jupiter that to save others like you from such loss I feel tempted to hunt over the statute books for some law now obsolete and forgotten, but not legally dead, that may be brought to bear upon this mischief and give it another Decian blight, which, if it do not kill, may yet check and obstruct its growth.' I replied, `that from him I could apprehend, he well knew, no such deed of folly or guilt — however likely it was that others might do it and glory in their shame — that his nature would save him from such a deed though his principles might not.' I told him, moreover, `that I did not despair of his looking upon Christianity with a favorable judgment in good time. He had been willing to hear, and there was that secret charm in the truths and doctrines of Christ's religion, and especially in his character, that however rudely set forth, the mind could scarcely resist it — against its will, it would oftentimes find itself subdued and changed. The seeds I have now dropt upon your hearts I trust will some day spring up and bear such fruit as you yourselves will rejoice in.' `So,' said Marcus, `may the wheat spilled into the Tiber, or sown among rocks, or eaten by the birds.' `And that may be, though not to-day nor to-morrow,' I replied. `The seed of things essential to man's life, as of wheat, is not easily killed. It may be buried for years and years, yet turned up at length to the sun and its life sprouts upward in leaf and stem and fruit. Borne down by the waters of the Tiber and apparently lost, it may be cast up upon the shores of Egypt or Britain and fulfill its destiny. The seed of truth is longer-lived still — by reason that what it bears is more essential than wheat or other grain to man's best life.' `Well, well,' said Marcus, `let us charge our goblets with the bottom of this Falernian, and forgetting whether there be such an entity as truth or not, drink to the health of the princess Julia.' `That comes nearer our hearts,' said Lucilia, `than anything that has been spoken for the last hour. When you return, Lucius, Laco must follow you with a muleload of some of my homely products' — She was about to add more, when we were all alike startled and alarmed by cries, seemingly of deep distress, and rapidly approaching. We sprung from our seats, when the door of the room was violently flung open and a slave rushed in, crying out, `Oh, sir! Gallus — Gallus' — `What is it? What is it?' — cried Marcus and Lucilia. `Speak quick — has he fallen?' `Oh no; the pond — the fish-pond — run — fly' — Distractedly we hurried to the spot already surrounded by a crowd of slaves. Who had been with him? Where had he fallen? were questions hastily asked, but which no one could answer. It was a miserable scene of agony, confusion and despair — Marcus ordering his slaves to dive into the pond, then uttering curses upon them, and commanding those to whom Gallus was usually entrusted to the rack. No one could swim, no one could dive. It was long since I had made use of an art which I once possessed, but instantly I cast off my upper garments, and needing no other direction to the true spot than the barking of the little dog and his jumping in and out of the water — first learning that the water was deep and of an even bottom — I threw myself in, and in a moment guided by the white dress of the little fellow I grasped him and drew him to the surface. Life was apparently and probably to my mind extinct, but expressing a hope that means might yet be resorted to that should restore him, I bore him in my arms to the house. But it was all in vain. Gallus was dead. I shall not inflict a new sadness upon you, Fausta, by describing the grief of my friends, or any of the incidents of the days I now passed with them. They were heavy, melancholy days; for the sorrows of both Lucilia and Marcus were excessive and inconsolable. I could do nothing for them, nor say anything to them; yet while they were thus incapacitated for all action I could serve them essentially by placing myself at the head of their affairs, and relieving them of common cares and duties, that must otherwise have been neglected or have proved irksome and oppressive. The ashes of Gallus, committed to a small marble urn, have been deposited in a tomb in the centre of Lucilia's flower garden, which will soon be embowered by flowers and shrubs which her hand will delight to train around it. On the eve of the day when I was to leave them and return to Rome, we sat together in a portico which overlooks the Tiber. Marcus and Lucilia were sad, but at length in some sort calm. The first violence of sorrow had spent itself, and reflection was beginning to succeed. `I suppose,' said Marcus, `your rigid faith greatly condemns all this show of suffering which you have witnessed, Piso, in us, as if not criminal, at least weak and childish?' `Not so, by any means,' I rejoined. `The religion of the Christians is what one may term a natural religion; it does violence to not one of the good affections and propensities. Coming, as we maintain, from the creator of our bodies and our minds, it does them no injury, it wars not with any of their natural elements, but most strictly harmonizes with them. It aims to direct, to modify, to heal, to moderate — but never to alter or annihilate. Love of our offspring is not more according to our nature than grief for the loss of them. Grief therefore is innocent — even as praiseworthy as love. What trace of human wisdom — much less of divine — would there be in the arrangement that should first bind us by chains of affection strong as adamant to a child, or a parent, or a friend, and then treat the sorrow as criminal that wept with whatever violence as it saw the links broken and scattered, never again to be joined together?' `That certainly is a proof that some just ideas are to be found in your religion,' replied my friend. `By nothing was I ever more irreconcilably offended in the stoical philosophy than by its harsh violence towards nature under suffering. To be treated by your philosophy with rudeness and contempt because you yield to emotions which are as natural and therefore in my judgment as innocent as any, is as if one were struck by a friend or a parent to whom you fled for protection or comfort. The doctrines of all the others failed in the same way. Even the Epicureans hold it a weakness and even a wrong to grieve, seeing the injury that is thereby done to happiness. Grief must be suppressed and banished because it is accompanied by pain. That too seemed to me a false sentiment, because although grief is indeed in some sort painful yet is it not wholly so, but is attended by a kind of pleasure. How plain it is that I should suffer greatly more were I forcibly restrained by a foreign power or my own from shedding these tears and uttering these sighs for Gallus, than I do now while I am free to indulge my natural feelings. In truth it is the only pleasure that grief brings with it — the freedom of indulging it.' `He,' I said, as Marcus paused, giving way afresh to his sorrow, `who embraces the Christian doctrine, is never blamed, condemned, nor ridiculed by it for the indulgence of the emotions to which the loss of those whom we love gives birth. But then at the same time he will probably grieve and suffer much less under such circumstances than you — not because he is however forcibly restrained, but because of the influence upon his mind and his heart of truths and opinions which as a Christian he entertains, and which, without any will or act of his own, work within him and strengthen and console him. The Christian believing so firmly as he does, for example, in a God, not only on grounds of reason but of express revelation, and that this God is a parent, exercising a providence over his creatures, regardless of none, loving as a parent all, who has created mankind not for his own amusement or glory, but that life and happiness might be diffused: they who believe thus must feel very differently under adversity from those who like yourself believe nothing of it at all, and from those who, like the disciples of the Porch and the Academy, believe but an inconsiderable part of it. Suppose, Marcus and Lucilia, your whole population of slaves were, instead of strangers and slaves, your children, toward whom you experienced the same sentiments of deep affection that you did toward Gallus; how would you not consult for their happiness; and how plain it is that whatever laws you might set over them they would be laws of love, the end of which, however they might not always recognize it, would be their happiness — happiness through their virtue. This may represent with sufficient exactness the light in which Christians regard the Divinity, and the laws of life under which they find themselves. Admitting therefore their faith to be well founded, and how manifest is it that they will necessarily suffer less under adversity than you — nd not because any violence is done to their nature, but because of the benignant influences of such truths.' `What you say,' observed Lucilia, `affects the mind very agreeably; and gives a pleasing idea, both of the wisdom and mercy of the Christian faith. It seems at any rate to be suited to such creatures as we are. What a pity that it is so difficult to discern truth.' `It is difficult,' I replied; `the ebst things are always so: but it is not impossible; what is necessary to our happiness is never so. A mind of common powers, well disposed, seeking with a real desire to find, will rarely retire from the search wholly unsuccessful. The great essentials to our daily well-being and the right conduct of life the Creator has supplied through our instincts. Your natural religion, of which you have spoken, you find sufficient for most of the occurrences which arise both of doing and bearing. But there are other emergencies for which it is as evidently insufficient. Now as the Creator has supplied so perfectly in all breasts the natural religion which is so essential, it is fair to say and believe that He would not make additional truths almost equally essential to our happiness, either of impossible attainment, or encompassed by difficulties which could not with a little diligence and perseverance be overcome.' `It would seem so, certainly,' said Marcus; `but it is so long since I have bestowed any thought upon philosophical inquiries, that to me the labor would be very great and the difficulties extreme — for at present there VOL. I. 14 is scarcely so much as a mere shred or particle of faith to which as a nucleus other truths may attach themselves. In truth, I never look even to possess any clear faith in a God — it seems a subject wholly beyond the scope and grasp of my mind. I cannot entertain the idea of self-existence. I can conceive of him neither as one nor as divided into parts. Is he infinite and everywhere, himself constituting his universe — then he is scarcely a God; or is he a being dwelling apart from his works, and watching their obedience to their imposed laws? In neither of these conceptions can I rest.' `It is not strange,' I replied; `nor that refusing to believe in the fact of a God until you should be able to comprehend him perfectly, you should to this hour be without faith. If I had waited before believing until I understood, I should at this moment be as faithless as you, or as I was before I received Christianity. Do I comprehend the Deity? Can I describe the mode of his being? Can I tell you in what manner he sprang into existence? And whether he is necessarily everywhere in his works, and as it were constituting them? Or whether he has power to contract himself and dwell apart from them, their omniscient observer and omnipotent Lord? I know nothing of all this; the religion which I receive teaches nothing of all this. Christianity does not demonstrate the being of a God, it simply proclaims it; hardly so much as that indeed. It supposes it, as what was already well known and generally believed. I cannot doubt that it is left thus standing by itself, untaught and unexplained only because the subject is intrinsically incomprehensible by us. It is a great fact or truth which all can receive, but which none can explain or prove. If it is not believed either instinctively or through the recognition of it and declaration of it in some revelation, it cannot be believed at all. The mind of man is no more competent to reach and grasp it through reason, than his hands are to mould a sun. All the reasonings, imaginations, guesses, of self-styled philosophers, are here like the prattlings of children. They make you smile, but they do not instruct.' `I fear,' said Marcus, `I shall then never believe, for I can believe nothing of which I cannot form a conception.' `Surely,' I answered, `our faith is not bounded by our conceptions or our knowledge in other things. We build the loftiest palaces and temples upon foundations of stone, though we can form no conception whatever of the nature of a stone. So I think we may found a true and sufficient religion on our belief in the fact of a God, although we can form no conception whatever of his nature and the mode of his existence.' But I should fatigue you, Fausta, were I to give you more of our conversation. It ran on equally pleasant I believe to all of us, to a quite late hour; in which time almost all that is peculiar to the faith of the Christians came under our review. It was more than midnight when we rose from our seats to retire to our chambers. But before we did that, a common feeling directed our steps to the tomb of Gallus, which was but a few paces from where we had been sitting. There these childless parents again gave way to their grief; and was I stone that I should not weep with them? When this act and duty of piety had been performed we sought our pillows. As for me, I could not sleep for thinking of my friends and their now desolate house. For even to me, who was to that child almost a stranger and had been so little used to his presence, this place is no longer the same: all its brightness, life and spirit of gladness are gone. Everything seems changed. From every place and scene something seems to have been subtracted to which they were indebted for whatever it was that made them attractive. If this is so to to me, what must it be to Marcus and Lucilia? It is not difficult to see that a sorrow has settled upon their hearts which no length of time can heal. I suppose if all their estates had been swept away from them in a night, and all their friends, they would not have been so overwhelmed as by this calamity — in such a wonderful manner were they each woven into the child, and all into each other, as one being. They seem no longer to me like the same persons. Not that they are not often calm, and in a manner possessed of themselves; but that even then when they are most themselves, there has a dullness, a dreamy absence of mind, a fixed sadness, come over them that wholly changes them. Though they sit and converse with you, their true thoughts seem far away. They are kind and courteous as ever to the common eye, but I can see that all the relish of life and of intercourse is now to them gone. All is flat and insipid. The friend is coldly saluted; the meal left untasted, or partaken of in silence and soon abandoned; the affairs of the household left to others, to any who will take charge of them. They tell me that this will always be so; that however they may seem to others they must ever experience a sense of loss; not any less than they would if a limb had been shorn away. A part of themselves, and of the life of every day and hour, is taken from them. How strange is all this, even in the light of Christian faith! How inexplicable, we are ready to say, by any reason of ours, the providence of God in taking away the human being in the first blossoming; before the fruit has even shown itself, much less ripened! Yet is not immortality, the hope, the assurance of immortality, a sufficient solution? To me it is. This will not indeed cure our sorrows — they spring from somewhat wholly independent of futurity — but it vindicates the ways of the Omnipotent, and justifies them to our reason and our affections. Will Marcus and Lucilia ever rejoice in the consolations which flow from this hope? Alas! I fear not. They seem in a manner to be incapable of belief. In the morning I shall start for Rome. As soon as there you shall hear from me again. Farewell. While Piso was absent from Rome on this visit to his friend, it was my fortune to be several times in the city upon necessary affairs of the illustrious queen, when I was both at the palace of Aurelian and that of Piso. It was at one of these later visits that it became apparent to me that the emperor seriously meditated the imposing of restrictions of some kind upon the Christians; yet no such purpose was generally apprehended by that sect itself, nor by the people at large. The dark and disastrous occurrences on the day of the dedication were variously interpreted by the people; some believing them VOL. I. 14* to point at the Christians, some at the meditated expedition of the emperor, some at Aurelian himself. The popular mind was however greatly inflamed against the Christians, and every art was resorted to by the priests of the temples, and those who were as bigoted and savage as themselves among the people, to fan to a devouring flame the little fire that began to be kindled. The voice from the temple, however some might with Fronto himself doubt whether it were not from Heaven, was for the most part ascribed to the Christians, although they could give no explanation of the manner in which it had been produced. But as in the case of Aurelian himself, this was forgotten in the horror occasioned by the more dreadful language of the omens, which in such black and threatening array no one remembered ever to have been witnessed before. None thought or talked of anything else. It was the universal theme. This may be seen in a conversation which I had with a rustic, whom I overtook as I rode toward Rome, seated on his mule burdened on either side and behind with the multifarious produce of his farm. The fellow as I drew near to him seeming of a less churlish disposition than most of those whom one meets upon the road, who will scarcely return a friendly salute, I feared not to accost him. After giving him the customary good wishes, I remarked upon the excellence of the vegetables which he had in his panniers. `Yes,' he said, `these lettuces are good, but not what they would have been but for the winds we have had from the mountains. It has sadly nipped them. I hear the queen pines away just as my plants do. I live at Norentum. I know you, sir, though you cannot know me. You pass by my door on your way to the city. My children often call me from my work to look up, for there goes the secretary of the good queen on his great horse. There's no such horse as that on the road. Ha, ha, my baskets reach but to your knee! Well, there are differences in animals and in men too. So the gods will it. One rides upon a horse with golden bits, another upon a mule with none at all. Still I say, let the gods be praised.' `The gods themselves could hardly help that,' I said, `if they made one man stronger or of more wit than another. In that case one would get more than another. And surely you would not have men all run in one mould — all five feet high, all weighing so much, all with one face, and one form, and one brain! The world were then dull enough.' `You say true,' he replied; `that is very good. If we were all alike there would be no such thing as being rich or poor — no such thing as getting or losing. I fear it would be dull enough, as you say. But I did not mean to complain, sir. I believe I am contented with my lot. So long as I can have my little farm with my garden and barns — my cattle and my poultry, a kind neighbor or so, and my priest and temple, I care for nothing more.' `You have a temple then at Norentum.' `Yes, to Jupiter Pluvius. And a better priest has not Rome itself. It is his brother, some officer of the emperor's, I take these vegetables to. I hope to hear more this morning of what I heard something when I was last at market. And I think I shall, for, as I hear, the city is a good deal stirred since the dedication the other day.' `I believe it is,' I answered. `But of what do you look to hear, if I may ask. Is there news from the East?' `O no, I think not of the East nor South. It was of something to be done about these Christians. Our temple you must know is half forsaken and more of late. I believe half the people of Norentum, if the truth were known, have turned Christians or Jews. Unless we wake up a little, our worship cannot be supported and our religion will be gone. And glad am I to hear through our priest that even the emperor is alarmed, and believes something must be done. You know than he there is not a more devout man in Rome. So it is said. And one thing that makes me think so is this. The brother of our priest — where I am going with these vegetables; here is poultry too, look! you never saw fatter I warrant you — told him that he knew it for certain that the emperor meant to make short work with even his own neice — you know who I mean — Aurelia, who has long been suspected to be a Christian. And that 's right. If he punishes any he ought not to spare his own.' `That I suppose would be right. But why should he punish any? You need not be alarmed nor offended; I am no Christian.' `The gods be praised therefor! I do not pretend to know the whole reason why. But that seems to be the only way of saving the old religion; and I do n't know what way you can possibly have of showing that a religion of yesterday is true, if a religion of a thousand years old is to be made out false. If religion is good for anything — and I for one think it is — I think men ought to be compelled to have it and support it, just as they should be to eat wholesome food rather than poisonous or hurtful. The laws won't permit us to carry certain things to market nor others in a certain state. If we do we are fined or imprisoned. Treat a Christian in the same way, say I. Let them just go thoroughly to work, and our temples will soon be filled again.' `But these Christians seem to be a harmless people.' `But they have no religion that anybody can call such. They have no gods nor altars nor sacrifices; such can never be harmless. To be sure, as to sacrifices, I think there is such a thing as doing too much there. I am not for human sacrifices. Nor do I see the need either of burning up a dozen fat oxen or heifers, as was done the other day at the Temple of the Sun. We in Norentum burn nothing but the hoofs and some of the entrails, and the rest goes to the priest for his support. As I take it, a sacrifice is just a sign of readiness to do everything and lose everything for the gods. We are not expected to throw either ourselves or our whole substance upon the altar; making the sign is sufficient. But as I said, these Christians have no altar and no sacrifice, nor image of god or goddess. They have at Norentum an old ruinous building — once a market — where they meet for worship; but those who have been present say that nothing is to be seen; and nothing heard but prayers — to what god no one knows — and exhortations of the priests. Some say that elsewhere they have what they call an altar and adorn their walls with pictures and statues. However all this may be, there seems to be some charm about them or their worship, for all the world is running after them. I long for the news I shall get from Varenus Hirtius. If these omens have not set the emperor at work for us, nothing will. Here we are at the gates, and I turn toward the Claudian market. May the day go happily with you.' So we parted, and I bent my way toward the gardens of Sallust. As I moved slowly along through the streets, my heart was filled with pity for this people — the Christians — threatened as it seemed to me with a renewal of the calamities that had so many times swept over them before. They had ever impressed me as a simple minded, virtuous community, of notions too subtle and spiritual for the world ever to receive, but which upon themselves appeared to exert a power altogether beneficial. Many of this faith I had known well, and they were persons to excite my highest admiration for the characters which they bore. Need I name more than the princess Julia and her husband, the excellent Piso? Others like them — what wonder if inferior — had also, both in Palmyra, and at Tibur and Rome, for they were to be found everywhere, drawn largely both on my respect and my affections. I beheld with sorrow the signs which now seemed to portend suffering and disaster. And my sympathies were the more moved seeing that never before had there been upon the throne a man who, if he were once entered into a war of opposition against them, had power to do them greater harm, or could have proved a more stern and cruel enemy. Not even Nero nor Domitian were in their time to be so much dreaded. For if Aurelian should once league him with the state against them, it would not with him be matter of mere cruel sport, but of conscience. It would be for the honor of the gods, the protection of religion, the greatness and glory of the empire, that he would assail and punish them; and the same fierce and bloody spirit that made him of all modern conquerors the bloodiest and fiercest, it was plain would rule him in any encounter with this humble and defenceless tribe. I could only hope that I was deceived as well as others in my apprehensions, or, if that were not so, pray that the gods would be pleased to take their great subject to themselves. Full of such reflections and emotions I arrived at the palace and was ushered into the presence of Livia. There was with her the melancholy Aurelia — for such she always seems — and who appeared to have been engaged in earnest talk with the empress, if one might judge by tears fast falling from her eyes. The only words which I caught as I entered were these from Aurelia, `but, dear lady, if Mucapor require it not, why should others think of it so much? Were he fixed, then should I indeed have to ask strength of God for the trial —' then seeing me and only receiving my salutations she withdrew. Livia, after first inquiring concerning Zenobia and Faustula, returning to what had just engaged her, said, `I wish, good Nichomachus, that I had your powers of speech of which as you can remember I have been witness in former days — those happy days in Syria — when you used so successfully to withstand and subdue my giddy or headstrong mind. Here have I been for weary hours — not weary neither for their aim has I am sure been a worthy one — but here have I been persuading with all the reason and eloquence I could bring to bear, this self-willed girl to renounce these fantastic notions she has imbibed from the Christians and their books, were it only for the sake of domestic peace. Aurelian is growing daily more and more exasperated against this obscure tribe, and drops oftener than I love to hear them dark hints of what awaits them, not excepting he says any of whatever rank or name. Not that I suppose he or the senate would proceed further than imprisonments, banishment, suppression of free speech, the destruction of books and churches; so much indeed I understand from him. But even thus far, and we might lose Aurelia — a thing not to be thought of for a moment. He has talked with her himself, reasoned with her, threatened her; but in vain. Now he has imposed the same task upon me — it is equally in vain. I know not what to do.' `Because,' I replied, `nothing can be done. Where it is possible to see, you have eyes within you that can penetrate the thickest darkness as well as any. But here you fail; but only where none could succeed. A sincere honest mind, princess, is not to be changed either by persuasion or force. Its belief is not subject to the will. Aurelia, if I have heard aright, is a Christian from conviction. Evidence made her a Christian — stronger evidence on the side of her former faith can alone unmake her.' `I cannot reason with her to that extent, Nichomachus,' replied the empress. `I know not the grounds of the common faith, any more than those of Christianity. I only know that I wish Aurelia was not a Christian. Will you, Nichomachus, reason with her? I remember your logic of old.' `Alas, princess, I can engage in no such task! Where I have no faith myself I should in vain attempt to plant it in others. How either can I desire that any mind should remain an hour longer oppressed by the childish and abominable superstitions which prevail in Rome? I cannot but congratulate the excellent Aurelia, so far as the question of truth is concerned, that in the place of the infinite stupidities of the common religion, she has received the, at least, pure and reasonable doctrines of the Christians. You cannot surely, princess, desire her re-conversion?' `Only for her own sake, for the sake of her safety, comfort, happiness.' `But in her judgment these are best and only secured where she now is. How thinks Mucapor?' `As I believe,' answered Livia, `he cares not in the matter, save for her happiness. He will not wish that she should have any faith except such as she herself wishes. I have urged him to use his power to constrain her, but he loves liberty himself too dearly, he says, to put force upon another.' `He is a noble fellow,' I said; `it is what I should have looked for from Mucapor.' `In good sooth, Nichomachus, I believe you still take me but for what I was in Palmyra. Who am I?' `From a princess you have become an empress, that I fully understand, and I trust never to be wanting in the demeanor that best becomes a subject; but you are still Livia, the daughter of Zenobia, and to her I feel I can never fear to speak with sincerity.' `How omnipotent, Nicomachus, are simplicity and truth! They subdue me when I most would not. They VOL. I. 15 have conquered me in Aurelia and now in you. Well, well, Aurelia then must take the full weight of her uncle's wrath, which is not light.' At this moment Aurelian himself entered, accompanied by Fronto. Livia at the same time rose and withdrew, not caring, I thought, to meet the eyes of that basilisk, who with the cunning of a priest she saw to be usurping a power over Aurelian which belonged of right to her. I was about also to withdraw, but the emperor constraining me as he often does, I remained, although holding the priest in still greater abhorrence I believe than Livia herself. `While you have been absent from the city, Fronto,' said Aurelian, `I have revolved the subjects upon which we last conversed, and no longer doubt where lie for me both duty and the truest glory. The judgment of the colleges, lately rendered, agrees both with yours and mine. So that the very finger of the god we worship points the way.' `I am glad,' replied Fronto, `for myself, for you, for Rome, and for the world, that truth possesses and is to sway you. It will be a great day for Rome, greater than when your triumphal array swept through the streets with the world at your chariot-wheels, when the enemy, that has so long waged successful war within the very gates, shall lie dead as the multitudes of Palmyra.' `It will, Fronto. But first I have this to say, and by the gods I believe it true, that it is the corruptions of our own religion and its ministers that is the offence that smells to heaven quite as much as the presumptuous novelties of this of Judea. I perceive you neither assent to this nor like it. But it is true, I am persuaded, as the gods themselves. I have long thought so; and while with one hand I aim at the Gallilean atheism, with the other I shall aim at those who dishonor by their vices and hypocrisies the religion they profess to serve.' Fronto was evidently disturbed. His face grew pale as the frown gathered and darkened on the brow of Aurelian. He answered not, and Aurelian went on. `Hellenism, Fronto, is disgraced and its very life threatened by the vices of her chief ministers. The gods forgive me in that while I have purged my legions of drunkards and adulterers, I have left them in the temples. Truly did you say, I have had but one thought in my mind, I have looked but to one quarter of the heavens. My eyes are now unsealed, and I see both ways and every way. How can we look for the favor of the gods while their houses of worship, I speak it, Fronto, with sorrow, but with the knowledge too of the truth of what I say, are houses of appointment, while the very inner sanctuaries and the altars themselves are little better than the common stews, while the priests are the great fathers of iniquity, corrupters of innocence, the seducers of youth, examples themselves beyond the fear of rivalry of all the vice they teach. At their tables too, who so swollen with meats and drink as the priests? Who but they are a by-word throughout the city for all that is vilest? What word but priest stands with all as an abbreviation and epitome of whatever pollutes and defiles the name of man? Porphyrius says `that since Jesus has been worshipped in Rome no one has found by experience the public assistance of the gods.' I believe it; and Rome will never again experience it till this black atheism is rooted out. But it is as true, I doubt not, that since their ministers have become ministers of demons, and from teachers of morals have turned instructers in vice — for this reason too as well as for the other the justly offended deities of Rome have hid themselves from their impious worshippers. Here then, Fronto, is a double labor to be undergone, a double duty to be done, not less than some or all of the labors of Hercules. We are set for this work, and not till I have begun it — if not finished — will I so much as dream of Persia. What say you?' Fronto looked like one who had kindled a larger flame than he intended, or knew well how to manage. `The faults of which you speak, great emperor, it can be denied by none are found in Rome, and can never be other than displeasing to the gods. But then I would ask when was it ever otherwise? In the earlier ages of the republic, I grant, there was a virtue in the people which we see not now. But that grew not out of the purer administration of religion, but was the product of the times in part — times in comparison with these of a primeval simplicity. To live well was easier then. Where no temptation is, virtue is necessary. But then it ceases to be virtue. It is a quality, not an acquisition — a gift of the gods rather than man's meritorious work.' `That is very true — well.' `There may be as much real virtue now, as then. May it not be so?' `Perhaps it may. What then?' `Our complaints of the present should be softened. But what chiefly I would urge is this, that since those ages of early virtue — after all perhaps, like all else at the same period, partly fabulous — Rome has been but what it is, adorned by virtues that have claimed the admiration of the world, and polluted by vices that have drawn upon her the reprobation of the good, yet which are but such as the world shows its surface over, from the farthest India to the bleak wastes of Britain. It is, Aurelian, a thing neither strange nor new that vices thrive in Rome. And long since have there been those like Nerva and the good Severus, and the late censor Valerian, who have aimed at their correction. These, and others who before and since have wrought in the same work, have done well for the empire. Their aim has been a high one, and the favor of the gods has been theirs. Aurelian may do more and better in the same work, seeing his power is greater and his piety more zealous.' `These are admitted truths, Fronto, save the last; but whither do they tend?' `To this. Because, Aurelian, vice has been in Rome; because even the priesthood has been corrupt, and the temples themselves the sties you say they now are — for this have the gods ever withdrawn their protection? Has Rome ever been the less prosperous? What is more, can we conceive that they who made us of their fiery mould, so prone to violate the bounds of moderation, would for yielding to such instincts interpose in wrath as if that had happened which was not foreseen, and against which they had made sure provision? Are the heavens to blaze with the fires of the last day, thunders to roll as if earth were shaken to her centre, the entrails of dumb beasts to utter forth terrific prophecy of VOL. I. 15* great and impending wo, because forsooth the people of Rome are by no means patterns of purity — because perchance within the temples themselves an immorality may have been purposed or perpetrated — because even the priests themselves have not been or are not white and spotless as their robes?' `There seems some reason in what you say.' `But, great emperor, take me not as if I would make myself the shield of vice, to hide it from the blow that would extirpate or cure it. I see and bewail the corruptions of the age; but as they seem not fouler than those of ages which are past, especially than those of Nero and of Commodus, I cannot think that it is against these the gods have armed themselves, but, Aurelian, against an evil which has been long growing and often assailed and checked, but which has now got to such giant size and strength, that except it be absolutely hewn down, and the least roots torn up and burned, both the altars of our gods, and their capital called Eternal — and the empire itself now holding the world in its wide-spread, peace-giving arms, are vanished, and anarchy, impiety, atheism, and the rank vices which in such times would be engendered, shall then reign omnipotent, and fill the very compass of the earth, Christ being the universal king. It is against this the heavens have arrayed their power, and to arouse an ungrateful, thoughtless, impious people, and their sleeping king, that they have spoken in thunder.' `Fronto, I almost believe you right.' `Had we, Aurelian, but the eyes of moles when the purposes of the gods are to be deciphered in the character of events, we should long since have seen that the long series of disasters which have befallen the empire since the Gallilean atheism has taken root here, have pointed but to that — that they have been a chastisement of our supineness and sloth. When did Rome, almighty Rome, ever before tremble at the name of barbarian, or fly before their arms? While now is it not much that we are able to keep them from the very walls of Rome? They now swarm the German forests in multitudes which no man can count; their hoarse murmurs can be heard even here, ready, soon as the reins of empire shall fall into the hands of another Gallienus, to pour themselves upon the plains of Italy, changing our fertile lands and gorgeous cities into another Dacia. These things were not so once; and what cause there is in Rome so deep and high and broad to resolve for us the reason of this averted face of heaven, save that of which I speak, I cannot guess.' `Nor I,' said Aurelian; `I confess it. It must be so. My work is not three nor two; but one. I have brought peace to the empire in all its borders. My legions all rest upon their arms. Not a sword but is in its sheath — there for the present let it be glued fast. The season, so propitious for the great work of bringing again the empire into peace and harmony with the angry gods, seems to have been provided by themselves. How think you, Nichomachus?' — turning suddenly to me as if now for the first time aware that I was standing at his side. I answered `that I was slow to receive the judgment of Fronto or of himself in that matter. That I could not believe that the gods, who should be examples of the virtues to mankind, would ever ordain such sufferings for their creatures as must ensue were the former violences to be renewed against the Christians. So far from thinking them a nuisance in the state, I considered them a benefit.' `The Greek too,' said Fronto, breaking in, `is then a Christian.' `I am not a Christian, priest, nor as I think shall ever be one; but far sooner would I be one than take my faith from thee, which however it might guide me well through the wine vaults of the temple, or to the best stalls of the market, or to the selectest retreats of the suburra, would scarce show the way to heaven. I affront but the corruptions of religion, Aurelian. Sincerity I honor everywhere. Hypocrisy nowhere.' I thought Fronto would have torn me with his teeth and nails. His white face grew whiter, but he stood still. `Say on,' said the emperor, `though your bluntness be more even than Roman.' `I think,' I continued, `the Christians a benefit to the state, for this reason; not that their religion is what they pretend, a heaven-descended one, but that by its greater strictness it serves to rebuke the common faith and those who hold it, and infuse into it something of its own spirit. All new systems, as I take it, in their first beginning are strict and severe. It is thus by this quality they supercede older and degenerate ones; not because they are truer perhaps, but because they are purer. There is a prejudice among men, that the gods, whoever they may be and whatever they may be, love virtue in men, and for that accept them. When therefore a religion fails to recommend and enforce virtue, it fails to meet the judgment of men concerning the true character and office of a religion, and so, with the exception of such beasts, and such there always are, who esteem a faith in proportion to its corruptions, they look with favor upon any new one which promises to be what they want. It is for this reason that this religion from Judea has made its way so far and so soon. But it will by and by degenerate from its high estate just as others have done, and be succeeded by another that shall raise still higher expectations. In the meantime, it serves the state well, both by the virtue which it enjoins upon its own subjects and the influence it exerts by indirection upon those of the prevalent faiths, and upon the general manners and morals.' `What you say,' observed Aurelian musingly, `has some show of sense. So much at least may be said for this religion.' `Yet a lie,' said Fronto, `can be none the less hateful to the gods, because it sometimes plays the part of truth. It is a lie still.' `Hold,' said Aurelian, `let us hear the Greek. What else?' `I little thought,' I replied, `as I rode toward the city this morning, that I should at this hour be standing in the presence of the Emperor of Rome, a defender of the Christians. I am in no manner whatever fitted for the task. My knowledge is nothing; my opinions therefore worth but little, grounded as they are upon the loose reports which reach my ear concerning the character and doctrines of this sect, or upon what little observation I have made upon those whom I have known of that persuasion. Still I honor and esteem them, and such aid as I can bring them in their straits, shall be very gladly theirs. I will however add only one thing more to what I have said in answer to Fronto, who represents the gods as more concerned to destroy the Christians than to reform the common religion and the public morals. I cannot think that. Am I to believe that the gods, the supreme directors of human affairs, and whose aim must be man's highest well-being, regard with more abhorrence an error than a vice? — an error too that acts more beneficently than most truth, and is the very seed of the purest virtues? I can by no means believe it. So that if I were interpreter of the late omens, I should rather see them pointed at the vices which prevail; at the corruptions of the public morals, which are fouler than aught I had so much as dreamed of before I was myself a witness of them, and may well be supposed to startle the gods from their rest, and draw down their hottest thunderbolts. But I will not say more, when there must be so many able to do so much better in behalf of what I must still believe to be a good cause. Let me entreat the emperor, before he condemns, to hear. There are those in Rome, of warm hearts, sound heads, and honest souls, from whom, if from any on earth, truth may be heard, and who will set in its just light a doctrine too excellent to suffer as it must in my hands.' `They shall be heard, Nichomachus. Not even a Jew nor a Christian shall suffer without that grace; though I see not how it can avail.' `If it should not avail to plant in your mind so good an opinion of their way as exists in mine,' I resumed, `it might yet to soften it and dispose it to a more lenient conduct; and so many are the miseries of life in the natural order of events, that the humane heart must desire to diminish, not increase them. Has Aurelian ever heard the name of Probus the Christian?' The emperor turned toward Fronto with a look of inquiry. `Yes,' said the priest, `you have heard his name. But that of Felix, the bishop of the Christians, as he is called, is more familiar to you.' `Felix, Felix, that is the name I have heard most, but Probus too, if I err not.' `He has been named to you, I am certain,' added Fronto. `He is the real head of the Nazarenes, — the bishop but a painted one.' `Probus is he who turned young Piso's head. Is it not so?' `The very same; and beside his, the lady Julia's.' `No, that was by another, one Paul of Antioch, also a bishop and a fast friend of the queen. The Christians themselves have of late set upon him, as they were so many blood-hounds, being bent upon expelling him from Antioch. It is not long since, in accordance with the decree of some assembled bishops there, I issued a rescript dislodging him from his post, and planting in his place one Domnus. If our purposes prosper, the ejected and dishonored priest may find himself at least safer if humbler. Probus, — I shall remember him. The name leads my thoughts to Thrace, where our greater Probus waits for me.' `From Probus the Christian,' I said, `you will receive, whenever you shall admit him to your presence, a true account of the nature of the Christian's faith and of the actual condition of their community — all which can be had only from a member of it.' But little more was said, when I departed, and took my way again towards Tibur. It seemed to me, from the manner of the emperor more than from what he said, that he was settled— bound up to the bad work of an assault upon the Christians. To what extent it was in his mind to go, I could not judge; for his language was ambiguous, and sometimes contradictory. But that the darkest designs were harbored by him, over which he was brooding with a mind naturally superstitious, but now almost in a state of exasperation from the late events, was most evident.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VI. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. Having confined myself, in my last letter, to the affairs of Marcus and Lucilia, I now, Fausta, turn to those which concern us and Rome. I found on my return to the city that the general anxiety concerning the designs of Aurelian had greatly increased. Many rumors were current of dark sayings of his, which, whether founded in truth or not, contributed to alarm even the most hopeful, and raise serious apprehensions for the fate of this much and long-suffering religion. Julia herself partakes — I cannot say of the alarm — but of the anxiety. She has less confidence than I have in the humanity of the emperor. In the honors heaped upon Zenobia, and the favors shown herself and Vabalathus, she sees not so much the outpouring of benevolent feelings as a rather ostentatious display of imperial generosity, and what is called Roman magnanimity. For the true character of the man she looks into the graves of Palmyra — upon her smoking ruins — and upon the blood yet hardly dry that stains the pavements of the Cœlian. Julia may be right, though I am unwilling to believe it. Her judgment is entitled to the more weight in this severe decision, that it is ever inclined to the side of a too favorable opinion of character and motive. You know her nature too well, to believe her capable of exaggerating the faults of even VOL. I. 16 the humblest. Yet though such are her apprehensions, she manifests the same calm and even carriage as on the approach of more serious troubles in Palmyra. She is full of deepest interest in the affairs of the Christians, and by many families of the poorer sort is resorted to continually for aid, for counsel, or sympathy. Not one in the whole community is a more frequent and devout attendant upon the services of the church; and I need not add that I am her constant companion. The performance of this duty gives a value to life in Rome such as it never had before. Every seventh day, as with the Jews, only upon a different day, do the Christians assemble for the purposes of religious worship. And I can assure you it is with no trifling accessions of strength, for patient doing and patient bearing, that we return to our every-day affairs, after having listened to the prayers and the reasonings or exhortations of Probus. So great is the difference in my feelings and opinions from what they were before I left Rome for Palmyra, that it is with difficulty I persuade myself that I am the same person. Between Piso the Pyrronist and Piso the Christian, the distance seems immeasurable — yet in how short a time it has been past. I cannot say that I did not enjoy existence and value it in my former state, but I can say that my enjoyment of it is infinitely heightened as a Christian, and the rate at which I value it infinitely raised. Born and nurtured as I was, with Portia for my mother, a palace for my home, Rome for my country and capital, offering all the luxuries of the earth, and affording all the means I could desire for carrying on researches in study of every kind; surrounded by friends of the noblest and best families in the city, and I could not but enjoy life in some very important sense. While mere youth lasted and my thoughts never wandered beyond the glittering forms of things, no one could be happier or more contented. All was fair and beautiful around me — what could I ask for more? I was satisfied and filled. But by and by my dream of life was disturbed — my sleep broken. Natural questions began to propose themselves for my solution, such I suppose as sooner or later spring up in every bosom. I began to speculate about myself — about the very self that had been so long, so busy, about everything else beside itself. I wished to know something of my constitution, of my origin, my present condition, my ultimate fate. It seemed to me I was too rare and curious a piece of work to go to ruin, final and inevitable — perhaps to-morrow — at all events in a very few years. Of futurity I had heard — and of Elysium — just as I had heard of Jupiter, greatest and best, but with my earliest youth these things had faded from my mind, or had already taken upon themselves the character of fable. My Virgil, in which I early received my lessons of language, at once divested them of all their air of reality, and left them naked fiction. The other poets, (Livy helping them,) did the same work and completed it. But bent with most serious and earnest desires toward truth on what seemed to me the greatest theme, I could not remain where I was, and turned with highest expectations to the philosophers. I not only read, but I studied and pondered them with diligence, and with as sincere a desire of arriving at truth as ever scholar sat at the feet of his instructer. The result was anything but satisfying. I left off a universal sceptic, so far as human systems of philosophy were concerned, so far as they pretended to solve the enigma of God and man, of life and death; but with a heart yearning after truth, and even full of faith, if that may be called faith which would instinctively lay hold upon a God and a hope of immortality, though beaten back once and again by every form which the syllogism could assume. This was my state, Fausta, when I was found by Christianity. Without faith, and yet with it; doubting and yet believing; rejecting philosophy but leaning upon nature; dissatisfied but hoping. I cannot easily find words to tell you the change which Christian faith has wrought within me. All I can say is this, that I am a new man; I am made over again; I am born as it were into another world. Where darkness once was, there is now light brighter than the sun. Where doubt was, there is now certainty. I have knowledge and truth for error and perplexity. The inner world of my mind is resplendent with a day whose luminary will never set. And even the outer world of appearances and forms shines more gloriously, and has an air of reality which before it never had. It used to seem to me like the gorgeous fabric of a dream, and as if at some unexpected moment it might melt into air and nothingness, and I and all men and things with it; for there appeared to be no purpose in it; it came from nothing, it achieved nothing, and certainly seemed to conduct to nothing. Men like insects came and went; were born and died, and that was all. Nothing was accomplished, nothing perfected. But now, nature seems to me stable and eternal as God himself. The world being the great birth-place and nursery of these myriads of creatures — made as I ever conceived, in a divine likeness, after some godlike model, for what spirit of other spheres can be more beautiful than a perfect man, or a perfect woman? each animated with the principle of immortality — there is a reason for its existence and its perpetuity from whose force the mind cannot escape. It is, and it ever will be; and mankind upon it, a continually happier and more virtuous brotherhood. Yes, Fausta, to me as a Christian everything is new, everything better; the inward world, the outward world, the present and the future. Life is a worthier gift and a richer possession. I am to myself an object of a thousand-fold greater interest, and every other human being, from a poor animal that was scarce worthy its wretched existence, starts up into a god, for whom the whole earth may one day become too narrow a field either to till or rule. I am accordingly ready to labor both for myself and others. I once held myself too cheap to do much even for myself; for others I would do nothing except to feed the hunger that directly appealed to me, or relieve the wretchedness that made me equally wretched. Not so now. I myself am a different being, and others are different. I am ready to toil for such beings; to suffer for them. They are too valuable to be neglected, abused, insulted, trodden into the dust. They must be defended, and rescued, whenever their fellow-men — wholly ignorant of what they are and what themselves are about — would oppress them. More than all, do they need truth, effectually to enlighten and redeem them, and truth they must have at whatever cost. Let them only once know what they are, and the world is safe. Christianity tells them this, and Christianity they must have. The state VOL. I. 16* must not stand between man and truth; or if it do, it must be rebuked by those who have the knowledge and the courage, and made to resume its proper place and office. Knowing what has been done for me by Christian truth, I can never be content until to others the same good is at least offered, and I shall devote what power and means I possess to this task. The prospect now is of opposition and conflict. But it dismays not me, nor Julia, nor any of this faith who have truly adopted its principles. For if the mere love of fame, the excitement of a contest, the prospect of pay or plunder, will carry innumerable legions to the battle-field to leave there their bones, how much more shall the belief of a Christian arm him for even worse encounters? It were pitiful indeed, if a possession as valuable as that of truth could not inspire a heroism, which the love of fame or of money can. These things I have said to put you fully in possession of our present position, plans, and purposes. The fate of Christianity is to us now as absorbing an interest, as once was the fate of Palmyra. I had been in the city only long enough to give Julia a full account of my melancholy visit in the country, and to write a part of it to you, when I walked forth to observe for myself the signs which the city might offer, either to confirm or allay the apprehensions which were begun to be felt. I took my way over the Palatine, desiring to see the excellent Tacitus, whose house is there. He was absent, being suddenly called to Baiæ. I turned toward the Forum, wishing to perform a commission for Julia at the shop of Civilis — still alive and still compounding his sweets — which is now about midway between the slope of the hill and the Forum, having been removed from its former place where you knew it, under the eaves of the Temple of Peace. The little man of `smells' was at his post, more crooked than ever, but none the less exquisitely arrayed; his wig befitting a young Bacchus rather than a dried shred of a man beyond his seventieth year. All the gems of the east glittered on his thin fingers, and diamonds that might move the envy of Livia hung from his ears. The gales of Arabia, burdened with the fragrance of every flower of that sunny clime, seemed concentrated into an atmosphere around him; and in truth, I suppose a specimen of every pot and phial of his vast shop might be found upon his person concealed in gold boxes, or hanging in the merest fragments of bottles upon chains of silver or gold, or deposited in folds of his ample robes. He was odor in substantial form. He saluted me with a grace, of which he only in Rome is master, and with a deference that could not have been exceeded had I been Aurelian. I told him that I wished to procure a perfume of Egyptian origin and name, called Cleopatra's tears, and which was reputed to convey to the organs of smell an odor more exquisite than that of the rarest Persian rose or choicest gums of Arabia. The eyes of Civilis kindled with the fires of twenty — when love's anxious brow is suddenly cleared up by that little, but all comprehensive word, yes — as he answered, `Noble Piso, I honor you. I never doubted your taste. It is seen in your palace, in your dress, nay, in the very costume of your incomparable slave, who has done me the honor to call here in your service. But now have you given of it the last and highest proof. Never has the wit of man before compounded an essence like that which lies buried in this porphyry vase.' `You do not mean that I am to take away a vase of that size? I do not purchase essences by the pound!' Civilis seemed as if he would have fainted, so oppressed was he by this display of ignorance. My character I found was annihilated in a moment. When his presence of mind was recovered he said, `This vase? Great Jupiter! The price of your palace upon the Cœlian would scarce purchase it! Were its contents suddenly let loose and spilled upon the air, not Rome only, but Italy, would be bathed in the transporting and life-giving fragrance! Now I shall remove the cover, first giving you to know, that within this larger vase there is a number of smallest bottles, some of glass, others of gold, in each of which are contained a few of the tears, and which are warranted to retain their potency, and lend their celestial peculiarity to your clothes or your apartments, without loss or diminution in the least appreciable degree, during the life of the purchaser. Now, if it please you, bend this way and receive the air which I shall presently set free. How think you, noble Piso? Art not a new man?' `I am new in my knowledge such as it is, Civilis. It is certainly agreeable, most agreeable.' `Agreeable! So is mount Etna a pretty hill! So is Aurelian a fair soldier! so is the sun a good sized brazier! I beseech thee, find another word. Let it not go forth to all Rome that the most noble Piso deems the tears of Cleopatra agreeable!' `I can think no otherwise,' I replied. `It is really agreeable, and reminds me, more than anything else, of the oldest Falernian just rubbed between the palms of the hand, which you will allow is to compliment it in no moderate measure. But confess now, Civilis, that you have an hundred perfumes more delicious than this?' `Piso, I may say this, — they have been so.' `Ah, I understand you; you admit then it is the force of fashion that lends this extraordinary odor to the porphyry vase.' `Truly, noble Piso, it has somewhat to do with it, it must be acknowledged.' `It would be curious, Civilis, to know what name this bore, and in what case it was bestowed, and at what price sold, before the empress Livia fancied it. I think it should have been named `Livia's smiles.' It would at any rate be a good name for it at thy shop in Alexandria.' `You are facetious, noble Piso. But that last hint is too good to be thrown away. Truly, you are a man of the world, whose distinction I suppose is, that he has eyes in the hind part of his head as well as before. But what blame can be mine for such dealing? I am driven; I am a slave. It is fashion that works these wonders, not I. And there is no goddess, Piso, like her. She is the true creator. Upon that which is worthless can she bestow in a moment inestimable value. What is despised to-day, she can exalt to-morrow to the very pinnacle of honor. She is my maker. One day I was poor, the goddess took me by the hand and smiled upon me and the next day I was rich. It was the favorite mistress of Maximin, who one day — her chariot, Piso, so chance would have it, broke down at my door, when she took refuge in my little shop, then at the corner of the street Castor as you turn towards the Tiber — purchasing a particular perfume, of which I had large store and boasted much to her, gave me such currency among the rich and noble, that from that hour my fortune was secure. No one bought a perfume afterwards but of Civilis. Civilis was soon the next person to the emperor. And to this hour, has this same goddess befriended me. And many an old jar, packed away in the midst of rubbish in dark recesses now valueless, do I look upon as nevertheless so much gold — its now despised contents one day to disperse themselves upon kings and nobles, in the senate and the theatres. I need not tell you what this diminutive bottle might have been had for, before the Kalends. Yet, by Hercules, should I have sold it even then for less? for should I not have divined its fortune? The wheel is ever turning, turning. But, most excellent Piso, men of the world are ever generous —' `Fear nothing, Civilis, I will not betray you. I believe you have spoken real truths. Besides, with Livia on your side, and what could all Rome do to hurt you?' `Most true, most true. But may I ask? — for one thing has made me astonished — how is it that you, being now as report goes a Christian, should come to me to purchase essences? When I heard you had so named yourself, I looked to lose your custom forever after.' `Why should not a Christian man smell of that which is agreeable as well as another?' `Ah, that I cannot say. I have heard — I know nothing, Piso, beyond essences and perfumes — but I have heard the Christians forbear such things, calling them vanities; just as they withdraw too 't is said from the theatres and the circuses. `They do indeed withdraw from the theatres and circuses, Civilis, because the entertainments witnessed there do, as they judge, serve but to make beasts of men; they minister to vice. But in a sweet smell they see no harm, any more than in a silk dress or well-proportioned buildings, or magnificent porticos. Why should it be very wrong or very foolish to catch the odors, which the divine Providence plants in the rose, and in a thousand flowers and gums, as they wander forth upon the air for our delight, and fasten them up in these little bottles? by which means we can breathe them at all times — in winter as well as in summer. Thy shop, Civilis, is but a flower garden in another form and under another name.' `I shall think better of the Christians for this. I hardly believed the report indeed, for it were most unnatural and strange to find fault with odors such as these. I shall lament the more that they are to be so dealt with by the emperor. Hast thou heard what is reported this morning?' `No; I am but just from home. How does it go?' `Why, 't is nothing other nor less than this, that Aurelian, being resolved to change the Christians all back again into what they were, has begun with his niece the princess Aurelia, and with violence insists that she shall sacrifice — which she steadfastly refuses to do. Some say, that she has not been seen at the palace for several days, and that she is fast locked up in the great prison on the Tiber.' `I do not believe a word of it, Civilis. The emperor has of late used harsh language of the Christians, I know. But for one word he has spoken, the city has coined ten. And moreover, the words of the priest Fronto are quoted for those of Aurelian. It is well known he is especially fond of Aurelia; and Mucapor to whom she is betrothed, is his favorite among all his generals, not excepting Probus.' `Well, well, may it be as you say! I for my part should be sorry that any mishap should befall those with whom the most noble Piso is connected; especially seeing they do not quarrel, as I was fain to believe, with my calling. Yet never before, as I think, have I seen a Christian in my shop!' `They may have been here without your knowing it.' `Yes, that is true.' `Besides, the Christians being in the greater proportion of the middle or humbler classes, seek not their goods at places where emperors resort. They go elsewhere.' Civilis bowed to the floor as he replied, `You do me too much honor.' `The two cases of perfume which I buy,' I then said, `are to travel into the far East. Please to secure them accordingly.' `Are they not then for the Princess Julia, as I supposed?' `They are for a friend in Syria. We wish her to know what is going on here in the capital of all the world.' `By the gods! you have devised well. It is the talk all over Rome. Cleopatra's tears have taken all hearts. Orders from the provinces will soon pour in. They shall follow you well secured as you say.' I enjoy a call upon this whole Roman, and yet half Jew, as much as upon the first citizens of the capital. The cup of Aurelian is no fuller than the cup of Civilis. The perfect bliss that emanates from his countenance and breathes from his form and gait, is pleasing to behold — upon whatever founded — seeing it is a state that is reached by so few. No addition could be made to the felicity of this fortunate man. He conceives his occupation to be more honorable than the proconsulship of a province, and his name, he pleases himself with believing, is familiar to more ears than any man's save the emperor's; and has been known in Rome for a longer period than any other person's living, excepting only the head of the senate, the venerable Tacitus. This is all legible in the lines about his mouth and eyes. Leaving the heaven of the happy man, I turned to the Forum of Augustus, to look at a statue of brass of Aurelian, just placed among the great men of Rome in front of the Temple of Mars the Avenger. This statue is the work of Periander, who, with that universality of power which marks the Greek, has made his genius as distinguished here for sculpture as it was in Palmyra for military defence and architecture. Who for perfection in this art of arts is to be compared with the Greek? or for any work of either the head or the hands, that implies the possession of what we mean by genius? The Greeks have not only originated all that we know of great and beautiful in letters, philosophy and the arts; but what they have originated they have also perfected. Whatever they have touched they have finished, at least VOL. I. 17 so far as art and the manner of working is concerned. The depths of all wisdom and philosophy they have not sounded indeed, though they have gone deeper than any, only because they are in their own essence unfathomable. Time as it flows on bears us to new regions to be explored, whose riches constantly add new stores to our wisdom, and open new views to philosophy. But in all art they have reached a point beyond which none have since advanced, and beyond which it hardly seems possible to go. A doric column, a doric temple, a corinthian capital, a corinthian temple — these perfectly satisfy and fill the mind; and for seven hundred years no change nor addition has been made or attempted that has not been felt to be an injury. And I doubt not that seven thousand years hence, if time could but spare it so long, pilgrims would still go in search of the beautiful from the remotest parts of the world, from parts now unknown, to worship before the Parthenon, and, may I not add, the Temple of the Sun in Palmyra! Periander has gained new honors by this admirable piece of work. I had hardly commenced my examination of it, when a grating voice at my elbow, and never once heard to be mistaken for any other, croaked out what was meant as a challenge, `The greatest captain of this or any age.' It was Spurius, a man whom no slight can chill, nor even an insult cause to abate the least of his intrusive familiarity — a familiarity which he covets too only for the sake of disputation and satire. To me however he is never other than a source of amusement. He is a variety of the species I love occasionally to study. I told him I was observing the workmanship, without thinking of the man represented. `If you will allow me to say it,' he rejoined, `a very inferior subject of contemplation. A statue, as I take it, the thing for which it is made, is commemoration. If one wants to see fine work in marble, there is the cornice for him just overhead: or in brass, let him look at the doors of the new temple, or the last table or couch of Syphax. The proper subject for man is man.' `Well, Spurius, on your own ground then. In this brass I do not see brass, nor yet Aurelian —' `What then, in the name of Hecate?' `Nothing but intellect. The mind, the soul of the greater artist, Periander. That drapery never fell so upon Aurelian; nor was Aurelian's form or bearing ever like this. It is all ennobled, and exalted above pure nature, by the divine power of genius. The true artist, under every form and every line of nature, sees another form and line of more perfect grace and beauty, which he chooses instead, and makes it visible and permanent in stone or brass. You see nothing in me, but merely Piso as he walks the streets. Periander sees another within, bearing no more resemblance to me — yet as much — than does this to Aurelian.' `That I simply conceive to be so much sophistry,' rejoined the poet, `which no man would be guilty of, except he had been for the very purpose, as one must think, of degrading his intellect, to the Athenian schools. Still, as I said and think, the statue is made to commemorate the man represented, not the artist.' `It is made for that. But oftentimes the very name of the man commemorated is lost, while that of the artist lives forever. In my judgment there is as much of Periander in this statue as there is of Aurelian.' `I know not what the fame of this great Periander may be ages hence. It has not till now reached my ear.' `It is not easy to reach the ears of some who dwell in the via cœli.' I could not help saying that. `My rooms, sir, I would inform you,' he rejoined sharply, `are on the third floor.' `Then I do wonder you should not have heard of Periander.' `Greater than Aurelian, and I must wonder too! A poet may be greater than a general or an emperor, I grant: he is one of the family of the gods; but how a worker in brass or marble can be, passes my poor understanding. It is vain to attempt to raise the mere artist to the level of the historian or poet.' `I think that too. I only said he was greater than Aurelian —' `Than Aurelian,' replied Spurius, `who has extended the bounds of the empire!' `But narrowed those of human happiness,' I answered. `Which is of more consequence, empire or man? But now, man was the great object! I grant you he is, and for that reason a man who, like an artist of genius, adds to the innocent sources of human enjoyment, is greater than the soldier and conqueror, whose business is the annoyance and destruction of life. Aurelian has slain hundreds of thousands. Periander never injured a worm. He dwells in a calm and peaceful world of his own, and his works are designed to infuse the same spirit that fills himself into all who behold them. You must confess the superior power of art and the artist in this very figure. Who thinks of conquest, blood, and death, as he looks upon these flowing outlines, this calm, majestic form — upon that still face? The artist here is the conqueror of the conqueror, and makes him subserve his own purposes; purposes of a higher nature than the mere soldier ever dreamed of. No one can stand and contemplate this form, without being made a lover of beauty rather than of blood and death; and beauty is peace.' `It must be impossible,' replied the sour spirit, `for one who loves Palmyra better than his native Rome, to see much merit in Aurelian. It is a common saying, Piso is a Palmyrene. The report is current too that Piso is about to turn author, and celebrate that great nation in history.' `I wish I were worthy to do so,' I answered, `I might then refute certain statements in another quarter. Yet events have already refuted them.' `If my book,' replied Spurius, `be copied a thousand times, the statements shall stand as they are. They are founded upon indisputable evidence and philosophical inferences.' `But, Spurius, they are every one contradicted by the late events.' `No matter for that, if they were ever true they must always be true. Reasoning is as strong as fact. I found Palmyra a vulgar, upstart, provincial city; the most distasteful of all spots on earth to a refined mind; such I left it, and such I have shown it to the world.' `Yet,' I urged, `if the Palmyrenes in the defence of their country showed themselves a brave, daring, and VOL. I. 17* dangerous foe, as they certainly were magnanimous; if so many facts and events prove this, and all Rome admits it, it will seem like little else than malice for such pages to circulate in your book. Besides, as to a thousand other things I can prove you wrong.' `Because I have but one eye, am I incapable of vision? Am I to be reproached with my misfortunes? One eye is the same as two; who sees two images except he squint? I can describe that wain, loaded down with wine casks drawn by four horses with scarlet trappings, the driver with a sweeping Juno's favor in his cap, as justly as you can. Who can see more?' `I thought not, Spurius, of your misfortune, though I must think two eyes better for seeing than one, but only of favorable opportunities for observation. You were in Palmyra from the ides of January to the nones of February, and lived in a tavern. I have been there for more than half a year, and dwelt among the citizens themselves. I knew them in public and in private, and saw them under all circumstances most favorable to a just opinion, and I can affirm that a more discolored picture of a people was never drawn than yours.' `All the world,' said the creature, `knows that Spurius is no flatterer. I have not only published travels among the Palmyrenes, but I intend to publish a poem also — yes, a satire — and if it should be entitled “Woman's pride humbled,” or “The downfall of false greatness,” or, “The gourd withered in a day,” or “Mushrooms not oaks,” or “Ants not elephants,” what would there be wonderful in it? — or if Romans should figure largely in it, eh?' `Nothing is less wonderful, Spurius, than the obstinacy and tenaciousness of error.' `Periander greater than Aurelian!' rejoined he, moving off; `that is a good thing for the town.' As I turned, intending to visit the shop of Demetrius, to see what progress he was making in his silver Apollo, I was accosted by the consul Marcellinus. `A fair morning to you, Piso,' said he; `and I see you need the salutation and the wish, for a black cloud has just drifted from you, and you must still feel as if under the shadow. Half the length of the street, as I slowly approached, have I witnessed your earnest discourse with one whom I now see to have been Spurius. But I trust your Christian principles are not about to make an agrarian of you? Whence this sudden intimacy with one like Spurius?' `One need not, I suppose, be set down as a lover of an east wind because they both sometimes take the same road, and can scarcely separate if they would? But to speak the truth, a man is to me a man, and I never yet have met one of the race from whom I could not gain either amusement, instruction or warning. Spurius is better than a lecture from a philosopher, upon the odiousness of prejudice. To any one inclined to harbor prejudices would I recommend an hour's interview with Spurius, sooner far than I would send him to Cleanthes the Stoic, or Silius the Platonist, or, I had almost said, Probus the Christian.' `May I ask,' said he, `Piso, if you have in sober earnest joined yourself to the community of the Christians, or are you only dallying for a while with their doctrines, just as our young men are this year infected by the opinions of Cleanthes, the next followers of Silius, the third of the nuisance Crito, and the fourth, adrift from all, and the fifth, good defenders, if not believers, of the popular superstitions? I presume I may believe that such is the case with you. I trust so, for the times are not favorable for the Christians, and I would like to know that you were not of them.' `I am however of them, heart and soul. I have been a Christian ever since I first thoroughly comprehended what it meant.' `But how can it be possible that, standing as you do at the head as it were of the nobility and wealth of Rome, you can confound yourself with this obscure and vulgar tribe? I know that some few of reputation are with them beside yourself; but how few! Come, come, disabuse yourself of this error and return to the old, safe, and reputable side.' `If mere fancy, Marcellinus, had carried me over to the Christians, fancy or whim might bring me away from them. But if it be, on the other hand, a question of truth, then it is clear, fashion and respectability, and even what is safest, or most expedient, are arguments not to be so much as lisped.' `No more, no more! I see how it is. You are fairly gone from us. Nevertheless, though it may be thought needful to check the growth of this sect, I shall hope that your bark may sail safely along. But this reported disappearance of Aurelia shows that danger is not far off.' `Do you then credit the rumor?' `I can do no otherwise. It is in every part of the town. I shall learn at the Capitol. I go to meet the senate.' `One moment: Is my judgment of the senate a right one in this, that it would not second Aurelian in an attack upon the privileges, property, or lives of the Christians?' `I think it is. Although, as I know, there are but few Christians in the body — how many you know surely better than I — yet I am persuaded it would be averse to acts of intolerance and persecution. Will you not accompany me to the sitting?' `Not so early. I am first bound elsewhere.' You know, Fausta, that I avoid the senate. Being no longer a senate, a Roman senate, but a mere gathering of the flatterers of the reigning emperor, whoever he may be, neither pleasure nor honor can come of their company. There is one aspect however, at the present moment, in which this body is to be contemplated with interest. It is not, in matters of religion, a superstitious body. Here it stands, between Aurelian with the populace on his side, and the Christians, or whatever religious body or sect there should be any design to oppress or exterminate. It consists of the best and noblest, and richest, of Rome; of those who have either imbibed their opinions in philosophy and religion from the ancient philosophers or their living representatives, or are indifferent and neglectful of the whole subject; which is the more common case. In either case they are as a body tolerant of the various forms which religion or superstition may assume. The only points of interest or inquiry with them would be, whether any specified faith or ceremonies tended to the injury of the state? whether they affected to its damage the existing order of civil affairs? These questions being answered favorably on the part of the greater number, there would be no disposition to interfere. Of Christianity, the common judgment in that body, and among those in the capital who are of the same general rank, is for the most part favorable. It is commended for its modesty, for the quiet and unostentatious manner in which its religious affairs are managed, and for the humble diligence with which it concerns itself with the common people and the poor, teaching them their truths, whatever they may be, and especially ministering so largely to their outward necessities. I am persuaded, any decision of the senate concerning the Christians would be indulgent and paternal, and that it would in opinion and feeling be opposed to any violence whatever on the part of Aurelian. But then, alas! it is little that they can do with even the best purposes. The emperor is absolute — the only power, in truth, in the state. The senate exists but in name and form. It has even less independent power than that of Palmyra had under Zenobia. Yours indeed was dependent through affection and trust, reposing in a higher wisdom than its own. This, through fear and the spirit of flattery. So many members too were added, after the murderous thinning of its seats in the affair of the mint, that now scarce a voice would be raised in open opposition to any course the emperor might adopt. The new members being moreover of newer families, nearer the people, are less inclined than the others to resist any of his measures. Still it is most evident, that there is an under current of ill-will, opposition, jealousy, distrust, running through the body, which, if the opportunity should present itself and there were courage enough for the work, may show itself and make itself felt and respected. The senate, in a word, though slavish and subservient, is not friendly. But I am detaining you from the company of Demetrius, of which you were always fond. I soon reached his rich establishment, and being assured that he of Palmyra was within, I entered. I was carried through many apartments, filled with those who were engaged in some one of the branches of this beautiful art, to that which was sacred to the labors of the two brothers, who are employed solely in the invention of the designs of their several works, in drawing the plans, in preparing the models, and then of overseeing the younger artists at their tasks, themselves performing all the higher and more difficult parts and processes of their art. Demetrius was working alone at his statue; the room, in which he was, being filled either with antiquities in brass, ivory, silver, or gold, or with finished specimens of their own skill, all disposed with the utmost taste and with all the advantages to be derived from the architecture of the room, from a soft and mellowed light, resembling moonlight, which came through alabaster windows, and from the rich cloths, silks, and other stuffs, and the highly ornamented cases in which various articles of greatest perfection and value were kept and exhibited. Here stood the enthusiast, applying himself so intently to his task, that he neither heard the door of the apartment as it opened, nor the voice of the slave who announced my name. But in a moment, as he suddenly retreated to a dark recess to observe from that point the effect of his touches as he proceeded, he saw me, and cried out, `Most glad to greet you here, Piso; your judgment is at this very point what I shall be thankful for. Here, if it please you, move to the very spot in which I now am in, and tell me especially this, whether the finger of the right hand should not be turned a line farther toward the left of the figure. The metal is obstinate, but still it can be bent if necessary. Now judge, and speak your judgment frankly, for my sake.' I sank back into the recess as desired, and considered attentively the whole form, rough now and from the moulds, and receiving the first finishing touches from the rasp and the chisel. I studied it long and at my leisure, Demetrius employing himself busily about some other matters. It is a beautiful and noble figure, worthy any artist's reputation of any age, and of a place in the magnificent temple for which it is designed. So I assured Demetrius, giving him at length my opinion upon every part. I ended with telling him I did not believe that any effect would be gained by altering the present direction of the finger. It had come perfect from the moulds. `Is that your honest judgment, Piso? Christians, they say, ever speak the exact truth. Fifty times have I gone where you now are to determine the point. My brother says it is right. But I cannot tell. I have attempted the work in too much haste; but Aurelian thinks, I believe, that a silver man may be made as easily as a flesh one may be unmade. Rome is not Palmyra, Piso. What a life there for an artist! Calm as a summer sea. Here! by all the gods and goddesses! if one hears of anything but of blood and death! Heads all on where they should be to-day, to-morrow are off. To-day, captives cut up on the altars of some accursed god, and to-morrow thrown to some savage beast no better and no worse for the entertainment of savages worse than either or all. The very boys in the streets talk of little else than of murderous sports of gladiators or wild animals. I swear to you, a man can scarce collect or keep his thoughts here. What's this about the Christians too? I marvel, Piso, to see you here with your head on! They say you are to be all cut up root and branch. Take my advice, and fly with me back to Palmyra! Not another half year would I pass among these barbarians for all the patronage of the emperor, his minions, and the senate at their back. What say you?' `No, Demetrius, I cannot go; but I should not blame you for going. Rome is no place, I agree with you, for the life contemplative, or for the pure and innocent labors of art. It is the spot for intense action; but —' `Suffering you mean —' `That too, most assuredly, but of action too. It is the great heart of the world.' `Black as Erebus and night.' `Yes, but still a great one, and which, if it can be once made to beat true, will send its blood then a pure and life-giving current to the remotest extremities of the world, which is its body. I hope for the time to come when this will be true. There is more goodness in Rome, Demetrius, than you have heard of or know of. There is a people here worth saving: I, with the other Christians, am set to this work. We must not abandon it.' `'T will be small comfort though, should you all perish doing it.' `Our perishing might be but the means of new and greater multitudes springing up to finish what we had VOL. I. 18 begun, but left incomplete. There is great life in death. Blood spilled upon the ground is a kind of seed that comes up men. Truth is not extinguished by putting out life. It then seems to shine the more brightly as if the more to cheer and comfort those who are suffering and dying for it.' `That may be or may not,' said the artist, `here and there; but, in my judgment, if this man-slayer, this world-butcher once fastens his clutches upon your tribe he will leave none to write your story. How many were left in Palmyra? — Just, Piso, resume your point of observation, and judge whether this fold of the drapery were better as it is, or joined to the one under it, an alteration easily made.' I gave him my opinion, and he went on filing and talking. `And now, Piso, if I must tell you, I have conceived a liking for you Christians, and it is for this reason partly I would have you set about to escape the evil that is threatened at least. Here is my brother, whose equal the world does not hold, is become a Christian. Then do you know here is a family, just in the rear of our shop, of one Macer, a Christian and a preacher, that has won upon us strangely. I see much of them. Some of his boys are in a room below, helping on by their labor the support of their mother and those who are younger, for I trow Macer himself does little for them, whatever he may be doing for the world at large, or its great heart as you call it. But what is more still,' cried he with emphasis and a jump at the same moment, throwing down his tools, `do you know the Christians have some sense of what is good in our way? they aspire to the elegant as well as others who are in better esteem.' And as he finished, he threw open the doors of a small cabinet, and displayed a row of dishes, cups, and pitchers, of elegant form and workmanship. `These,' he went on, `are for the church of Felix the bishop of the Christians. What they do with them I know not, but as I was told by the bishop, they have a table or altar of marble on which at certain times they are arranged for some religious rite or other. They are not of gold, as they seem, but of silver gilded. My brother furnished the designs and put them into the hands of Flaccus, who wrought them. Neither I nor my brother could labor at them, as you may believe, but it shows a good ambition in the Christians to try for the first skill in Rome or the world, — does it not? They are a promising people.' Saying which he closed the doors and flew to his work again. At the same moment the door of the apartment opened, and the brother Demetrius entered accompanied by Probus. When our greetings were over, Probus said, continuing as it seemed a conversation just broken off, `I did all I could to prevent it, but the voice of numbers was against me, and of authority too, and both together they prevailed. You, I believe, stood neuter, or indeed I may suppose knew nothing about the difference?' `As you suppose,' replied the elder Demetrius, `I knew nothing of it, but designed the work and have completed it. Here it is.' And going to the same cabinet, again opened the doors and displayed the contents. Probus surveyed them with a melancholy air, saying, as he did so, `I could bear that the vessels used for the purpose to which these are destined should be made of gold, or even of diamond itself, could mines be found to furnish it, and skill to hollow it out. For the wine which these shall hold is that which, in the way of symbol, shadows forth the blood of Christ which, by being shed on the cross, purchased for us this truth, this faith, and hope, from which we derive so much happiness, and which are to be an inheritance of happiness infinitely better and more complete than that which we enjoy in these days of fear, to the world through all ages. What should be set out with every form of human honor and decoration, if not this?' `I think so,' replied Demetrius; `to that which we honor and reverence in our hearts we must add the outward sign and testimony, especially if we would affect in the same way that ours are the minds of others. Paganism understands this; and it is the pomp and magnificence of her ceremony, the richness of the temple service, the grandeur of her architecture, and the imposing array of her priests in their robes, ministering at the altars or passing through the streets in gorgeous procession, with banners, victims, garlands, and music, by which the populace are gained and kept. That must be excellent and highly to be esteemed, they say, on which the great, the learned, and the rich, above all the state itself, are so prompt to lavish so much splendor and wealth.' `But here is a great danger,' Probus replied. `This carried too far may convert religion into show and ostentation. Form and ceremony, and all that is merely outward and material, may take the place of the moral and spiritual. Religion may come to be a thing apart by itself, a great act, a tremendous and awful rite, a magnificent and imposing ceremony, instead of what it is in itself, simply a principle of right action toward man and toward God. This is at present just the character and position of the Roman religion. It is a thing that is to be seen at the temples, but nowhere else; it is a worship through sacrifices and prayers, and that is all. The worshipper at the temple may be a tyrant at home, a profligate in the city, a bad man everywhere, and yet none the less a true worshipper. May God save the religion of Christ from such corruption! Yet is the beginning to be discerned. A decline has already begun. Rank and power are already sought with an insane ambition, and to perpetuate and render more imposing the power, the same means are resorted to by Christian ministers that have been by Roman emperors. The people are dazzled by state and show, and so blinded to the encroachments made upon their liberty. Some too, with a less criminal motive, but with an aim quite as mistaken, seek to transfer to Christianity the same outward splendor and the same gilded trappings which they see so to subdue the imagination — and by that lead them captive — of the common people. Hence, Piso and Demetrius, the golden chair of Felix, and his robes of audience, on which there is more gold as I believe than would gild all these cups and pitchers; hence too the finery of the table, the picture behind it, and, in some churches the statues of Christ and of Paul and Peter. VOL. I. 18* These golden vessels for the supper of Christ's love, I can forgive — I can welcome them — but in the rest that has come and is coming, I see signs of danger.' `But, most excellent Probus,' said the younger Demetrius, `I like not to hear the arts assailed and represented dangerous, and I like your way the less for what you have now said. I have just been telling Piso, that you are a people to be respected, for you were beginning to honor the arts. But here now have you just denounced them. What harm could it do any good man among you to come and look at this figure of Apollo, or a statue of your Paul or Peter, as you name them — supposing they were just men and benefactors of their race?' `There ought to be none,' Probus replied. `It ought to be a source of innocent pleasure, if not of wholesome instruction, to gaze upon the imitated form of a good man — of a reformer, a benefactor, a prophet. But man is so prone to religion, that you can scarce place before him an object of reverence but he will straightway worship it. What were your gods but once men, first revered, then worshipped, and now their stone images deemed to be the very gods themselves? Thus the original and natural idea of one supreme Deity has been almost lost out of the world. Let the figure of Christ be everywhere set before the people, and what with the natural tendency of the mind, and what with the force of example in the common religion, I fear it would not be long before he, whom we now revere as a prophet, would be worshipped as a god; and the disciples whom you have named, soon in like manner, would no longer be remembered with gratitude and affection as those who devoted their lives to the service of their fellow-men, but adored superstitiously as inferior Deities, like your Castor and Pollux. I can conceive that in the lapse of ages men shall be so redeemed from the gross conceptions that now inthrall them concerning both God and his worship, and so nourished up to a divine strength by the power of truth, that they shall be in no danger from such sources, but shall reap all the pleasure and advantage which can be derived either from beautiful forms of art and the representation of great and excellent characters, without ever dreaming that any other than the infinite and invisible Spirit of the universe is to be worshipped, or held divine. The religion of Christ will itself, if aught can do it, bring about such a period.' `That then will be the time for artists to live, next after now,' said Demetrius of Palmyra. `In the meantime, Probus, if Hellenism should decline and die, and your strict faith take its place, art will decline and perish. We live chiefly by the gods and their worship.' `If our religion,' replied Probus, `should suffer injury from its own professors, in the way it has, for a century or two more, it will give occupation enough to artists. Its corruptions will do the same for you that the reign of absolute and perfect truth would.' `The gods then grant that the corruptions you speak of may come in season, before I die. I am tired of Jupiters, Mercuries, and Apollos. I have a great fancy to make a statue of Christ. Brother! what think you, should I reach it? Most excellent Probus, should I make you such an one for your private apartments I do not believe you would worship it, and doubtless it would afford you pleasure. If you will leave a commission for such a work, it shall be set about so soon as this god of the emperor's is safe on his pedestal. What think you?' `I should judge you took me, Demetrius, for the priest of a temple, or a noble of the land. The price of such a piece of sculpture would swallow up more than all I am worth. Besides, though I might not worship myself — though I say not but I might — I should give an ill example to others, who, if they furnished themselves or their churches with similar forms, might not have power over themselves, but relapse into the idolatry from which they are but just escaped.' `All religions, as to their doctrine and precept, are alike to me,' replied Demetrius, `only as a general principle I should ever prefer that which had the most gods. Rome shows excellent judgment in adopting all the gods of the earth, so that if the worship of one god will not bring prosperity to the nation, there are others in plenty to try their fortune with again. Never doubt, brother, that it is because you Christians have no gods, that the populace and others are so hostile to you. Only set up a few images of Christ, and some of the other founders of the religion, and your peace will be made. Otherwise I fear this man-killer will, like some vulture, pounce upon you and tear you piecemeal. What, brother, have you learned of Aurelia?' `Nothing with certainty. I could find only a confirmation from every mouth, but based on no certain knowledge, of the rumor that reached us early in the morning. But what is so universally reported, generally turns out true. I should however, if I believed the fact of her imprisonment, doubt the cause. I said that I could conceive of no other cause, and feared that if the fact were so, the religion of Aurelian was the reason of her being so dealt with. It was like Aurelian, if he had resolved upon oppressing the Christians to any extent whatever, that he should begin with those who were nearest to him; first with his own blood, and then with those of his household.' With this and such like conversation I passed a pleasant hour at the rooms of Demetrius. My wish was, as I turned from the apartments of Demetrius, to seek the emperor or Livia, and learn from them the exact truth concerning the reports current through the city. But giving way to that weakness which defers to the latest possible moment the confirmation of painful news and the resolution of doubts which one would rather should remain as doubts than be determined in the wrong way, in melancholy mood I turned and retraced my steps. My melancholy was changed to serious apprehension by all that I observed and heard on my way to the Cœlian. As the crowd in this great avenue, the Suburra, pressed by me, it was easy to gather that the Christians had become the universal topic of conversation and dispute. The name of the unhappy Aurelia frequently caught my ear. Threatening and ferocious language dropt from many, who seemed glad that at length an emperor had arisen who would prove faithful to the institutions of the country. I joined a little group of gazers before the window of the rooms of Periander, at which something rare and beautiful is always to be seen, and who I found were looking intently at a picture, apparently just from the hands of the artist, which represented Rome under the form of a beautiful woman — Livia had served as the model — with a diadem upon her head, and the badges of kingly authority in her hands, and at her side a priest of the Temple of Jupiter, “Greatest and Best,” in whose face and form might plainly be traced the cruel features of Fronto. The world was around them. On the lowest earth, with dark shadows settling over them, lay scattered and broken, in dishonor and dust, the emblems of all the religions of the world, their temples fallen and in ruins. Among them, in the front ground of the picture, was the prostrate cross, shattered as if dashed from the church whose dilapidated walls and wide-spread fragments bore testimony not so much to the wasting power of time as to the rude hand of popular violence; while rearing themselves up into a higher atmosphere the temples of the gods of Rome stood beautiful and perfect, bathed in the glowing light of a morning sun. The allegory was plain and obvious enough. There was little attractive save the wonderful art with which it was done. This riveted the eye; and that being gained, the bitter and triumphant bigotry of the ideas set forth had time to make its way into the heart of the beholder, and help to change its warm blood to gall. Who but must be won by the form and countenance of the beautiful Livia? and confounding Rome with her, be inspired with a new devotion to his country, and its religion, and its lovely queen? The work was inflaming and insidious, as it was beautiful. This was seen in what it drew from those among whom I stood. `By Jupiter!' said one, `that is well done. They are all down, who can deny it! Those are ruins not to be built up again. Who knows who the artist is? He must be a Roman to the last drop of his blood and the least hair of his beard.' `His name is Sporus,' replied his companion, `as I hear, a kinsman of Fronto the priest of Apollo.' `Ah, that 's the reason the priest figures here,' cried the first, `and the empress too; for they say nobody is more at the Gardens than Fronto. Well, he 's just the man for his place. If any man can bring up the temples again, it 's he. Religion is no sham at the Temple of the Sun. The priests are all what they pretend to to be. Let others do so, and we shall have as much reason to thank the emperor for what he has done for the gods — and so for us all — as for what he has done for the army, the empire, and the city.' `You say well. He is for once a man who, if he will, may make Rome what she was before the empire, a people that honored the gods. And this picture seems as if it spoke out his very plans, and I should not wonder if it were so.' `Never doubt it. See, here lies a Temple of Isis flat enough; next to it one of the accursed tribe of Jews, and what ruder pile is that?' `That must be a temple of the British worship, as I think. But the best of all is this Christian church: see how the wretches fly while the work goes on! In my notion, this paints what we may soon see.' `I believe it. The gods grant it so! Old men, in my judgment, will live to see it all acted out. Do you hear what is said? That Aurelian has put to death his own niece, the princess Aurelia?' `That 's likely enough,' said another, `no one can doubt it. 'T is easy news to believe in Rome. But the question is, what for?' `No doubt for her impiety, and her aims to convert Mucapor to her own ways.' `Well, there is no telling, and it 's no great matter; time will show. Meanwhile, Aurelian forever! He 's the man for me!' `Truly is he,' said one at his side who had not spoken before, `for thy life is spent at the amphitheatres, and he is a good caterer for thee, sending in ample supplies of lions and men.' `Whew! who is here? Take care! Your tongue, old man, has short space to wag in.' `I am no Christian, knave, but I trust I am a man: and that is more than any can say of you, that know you. Out upon you for a savage!' The little crowd burst into loud laughter at this, and with various abusive epithets moved away. The old man addressed himself to me, who alone remained as they withdrew, — `Aurelian I believe would do well enough were he let alone. He is inclined to cruelty I know: but nobody can deny that, cruel or not, he has wrought most beneficial changes both in the army and in the city. He has been in some sort, up to within the last half year, a censor greater than Valerian; a reformer, greater and bettor than even he. Had he not been crazed by his successes in the East, and were he not now led, and driven, and maddened, by the whole priesthood of Rome, with the hell-born Fronto at their head, we might look for a new Rome. But as it is, I fear these young savages who are just gone will see all fulfilled they are praying for. A fair day to you.' And he too turned away. Others were come into the same spot, and for a long time did I listen to similar language. Many came, looked, said nothing, and took their way, with paler face, and head depressed, silent under the imprecations heaped upon the atheists, but manifestly either of their side in sympathy, or else of the very atheists themselves. I now sought my home, tired of the streets, of all I had seen and heard. Many of my acquaintance and friends passed me on the way, in whose altered manner I could behold the same signs which in ruder form I had just seen at the window of Periander. Not, Fausta, that all my friends of the Roman faith are summer ones, but that perhaps most are. Many among them, though attached firmly as my mother to the existing institutions, are yet like her possessed of the common sentiments of humanity, and would venture much or all to divert the merest shadow of harm from my head. Among these I still pass some of my pleasantest and most instructive hours — for with them the various questions involved in the whole subject of religion are discussed with the most perfect freedom and mutual confidence. Varus the prefect, whom I met among others, greeted me with unchanged courtesy. His sweetest smile was on his countenance as he swept by me, wishing me a happy day. How much more tolerable is the rude aversion or loud reproaches of those I have told you of, than this honied suavity, that means nothing and would be still the same though I were on the way to the block. As I entered my library, Solon accosted me to say, that there had been one lately there most urgent to see me. From his account, I could suppose it to be none other than the Jew Isaac, who, Milo has informed me, VOL. I. 19 is now returned to Rome, which he resorts to as his most permanent home. Solon said that, though assured I was not at home, he would not be kept back, but pressed on into the house, saying that `these Roman nobles often sat quietly in their grand halls, while they were denied to their poor clients. Piso was an old acquaintance of his when in Palmyra, and he had somewhat of moment to communicate to him and must see him.' `No sooner,' said Solon, `had he got into the library, the like of which I may safely affirm he had never seen before, for his raiment betokened a poor and ragged life, than he stood and gazed as much at his ease as if it had been his own, and then, by Hercules! unbuttoning his pack, for he was burdened with one both before and behind, he threw his old limbs upon a couch and began to survey the room! I could not but ask him, `If he were the elder Piso, old Cneius Piso, come back from Persia, in Persian beard and gown?'—`Old man,' said he, `your brain is turned with many books, and the narrow life you live here, shut out from the living world of man. One man is worth all the books ever writ, save those of Moses. Go out into the streets and read him, and your senses will come again. Cneius Piso! Take you me for a spirit? I am Isaac the Jew, citizen of the world, and dealer in more rarities and valuables than you ever saw or dreamed of. Shall I open my parcels for thee?' `No,' said I, `I would not take thy poor gewgaws for a gift. One worm-eaten book is worth them all.'—`God restore thy reason!' said he, `and give thee wisdom before thou diest; and that, by thy wrinkles and hairless pate, must be soon.' What more of false he would have added I know not, for at that moment he sprang from where he sat like one suddenly mad, exclaiming `Holy Abraham! what do my eyes behold, or do they lie? Surely that is Moses! Never was he on Sinai, if his image be not here! Happy Piso! and happy Isaac to be the instrument of such grace! Who could have thought it? And yet many a time in my dreams have I beheld him with a beard like mine, his hat on his head, his staff in his hand, as if standing at the table of the Passover, the princess with him, and — dreams will do such things — a brood of little chickens at their side. And now — save the last — it is all come to pass. And here too — who may this be? who but Aaron, the younger and milder. He was the speaker, and lo! his hand is stretched out! And this young Joseph is at his knee the better to interpret his character to the beholder. Moses and Aaron in the chief room of a Roman senator, and he a Piso! Now, Isaac, thou mayest tie on thy pack and take thy leave with a merry heart, for God if never before now accepteth thy works.' And much more, noble sir, in the same raving way, which was more dark to my understanding than the darkest pages of Aristotle.' I gathered from Solon that he would return in the evening in the hope to see me, for he had that to impart which concerned nearly my welfare. I was watching with Julia, from the portico which fronts the Esquiline and overlooks the city, the last rays of the declining sun, as they gilded the roofs and domes of the vast sea of building before us, lingering last upon, and turning to gold, the brazen statues of Antonine and of Trajan, when Milo approached us, saying that Isaac had returned. He was in a moment more with us. `Most noble Piso,' said he, `I joy to see thee again; and this morning I doubt not I should have seen thee but for the obstinacy of an ancient man, whose wits seem to have been left behind as he has gone onward. I seek thee, Piso, for matters of moment. Great princess,' he suddenly cried, turning to Julia with as profound a reverence as his double burden would allow, `glad am I to greet thee in Rome; not glad that thou wert forced to flee here, but glad that if out of Palmyra thou art here in the heart of all that can best minister to thy wants. Not a wish can arise in the heart but Rome can answer it. Nay, thou canst have few for that which is rare and costly but even I can answer them. Hast thou ever seen, princess, those diamonds brought from the caves of mountains a thousand miles in the heart of India, in which there lurks a tint, if I may so name it, like this last blush of the western sky? They are rarer than humanity in a Roman, or apostacy in a Jew, or truth in a Christian. I shall show thee one.' And he fell to unlacing his pack and drawing forth its treasures. Julia assured him she should see with pleasure whatever he could show her of rich or rare. `There are, lady, jewelers, as they name themselves in Rome, who dwell in magnificent houses, and whose shops are half the length of a street, who cannot show you what Isaac can out of an old goatskin pack. And how should they? Have they, as I have, traveled the earth's surface and trafficked between crown and crown? What king is there, whose necessities I have not relieved by purchasing his useless gems; or whose vanity I have not pleased by selling him the spoils of another? Old Sapor, proud as he was, was more than once in the grasp of Isaac. There! it is in this case — down, you see, in the most secret part of my pack — but who would look for wealth under this sordid covering? as who, lady, for a soul within this shriveled and shattered body? yet is there one there. In such outside, both of body and bag, is my safety. Who cares to stop the poor man, or hold parley with him? None so free of the world and its high ways as he; safe alike in the streets of Rome and on the deserts of Arabia. His rags are a shield stouter than one of seven-fold bull's hide. Never but in such guise could I bear such jewels over the earth's surface. Here, lady, is the gem; never has it yet pressed the finger of queen or subject. The stone I brought from the East, and Demetrius here in Rome hath added the gold. Give me so much pleasure —' And he placed it upon Julia's finger. It flashed a light such as we never before saw in stone. It was evidently a most rare and costly gem. It was of great size and of a hue such as I had never before seen. `This is a queen's ring, Isaac,' said Julia — `and for none else.' `It well becomes the daughter of a queen' — replied the Jew, `and the wife of Piso — specially seeing that — Ah, Piso! Piso! how was I overjoyed to-day to see in thy room the evidence that my counsels had not been thrown away. The Christian did not gain thee with all his cunning.' `Nay, Isaac' — I here interrupted him — `you must not let your benevolent wishes lead you into error. I am not yet a Jew. Those images that caught your eye were not wholly such as you took them for.' VOL. I. 19* `Well, well,' said the philosophic Jew, `rumor then has for once spoken the truth. She has long, as I learn, reported thee Christian: but I believed it not. And to-day, when I looked upon those statues, I pleased myself with the thought that thou, and the princess like her august mother, had joined yourselves to Israel. But if it be not so, then have I an errand for thee, which but now I hoped I might not be bound to deliver. Piso, there is danger brewing for thee, and for all who hold with thee!' `So I hear, Isaac, on all sides and partly believe it. But the rumor is far beyond the truth, I do not doubt.' `I think not so,' said Isaac. `I believe the truth is beyond the rumor. Aurelian intends more and worse than he has spoken; and already has he dipt his hand in blood!' `What say you? how is it you mean?' said Julia. `Whose name but Aurelia's has been in the city's ears these many days? I can tell you, what is known as yet not beyond the emperor's palace and the priest's, Aurelia is dead!' `Sport not with us, Isaac.' `I tell you, Piso, the simple truth. Aurelia has paid with her life for her faith. I know it from more than one whose knowledge in the matter is good as sight. It was in the dungeons of the Fabrician bridge that she was dealt with by Fronto the priest of Apollo.' `Aurelian then,' said Julia, `has thrust his sickle into another field of slaughter, and will not draw it out till he swims in Christian blood, as once before in Syrian. God help these poor souls! What, Isaac, was the manner of her death, if you have heard so much?' `I have heard only,' replied Isaac, `that after long endeavor on the part of Aurelian and the priest to draw her from her faith while yet at the palace, she was conveyed to the prisons I have named, and there given over to Fronto and the executioners, with this only restriction, that if neither threats, nor persuasions, nor the horrid array of engines, could bend her, then should she be beheaded without either scourging or torture. And so it was done. She wept, 't is said, as it were without ceasing, from the time she left the gardens; but to the priest would answer never a word to all his threats, entreaties, nor promises; except once, when that wicked minister said to her, `that except she in reality and truth would curse Christ and sacrifice, he would report that she had done so, and so liberate her and return her to the palace:' — at which, 't is said, that on the instant her tears ceased, her eyes flashed lightning, and with a voice, which took the terrific tones of Aurelian himself, she said, `I dare thee to it, base priest! Aurelian is an honorable man — though cruel as the grave — and my simple word, which never yet he doubted, would weigh more than oaths from thee, though piled to heaven! Do thy worst then, quick!' Whereupon the priest white with wrath, first sprang toward her as if he had been a beast set to devour her, drawing at the same moment a knife from his robes; but others being there he stopped, and cried to the executioner to do his work — raving that he had it not in his power first to torment her. Aurelia was then instantly beheaded.' We were silent as he ended, Julia dissolved in tears. Isaac went on. `This is great testimony, Piso, which is borne to thy faith. A poor, weak girl, alone, with not one to look on and encourage, in such a place, and in the clutches of such a hard-hearted wretch — to die without once yielding to her fears or the weakness of her tender nature — it is a thing hardly to be believed, and full of pity. Piso, thou wilt despise me when I say that my tribe rejoices at this and laughs; that the Jew is seen carrying the news from house to house, and secretly feeding on it as a sweet morsel! And why should he not? Answer me that, Roman! Answer me that, Christian! In thee, Piso, and in every Roman like thee, there is compacted into one the enmity that has both desolated my country and — far as mortal arm may do so — dragged down to the earth her altars and her worship. Judea was once happy in her ancient faith; and happier than all in that great hope inspired by our prophets in endless line, of the advent in the opening ages of one who should redeem our land from the oppressor, and give to her the empire of the world. Messiah, for whom we waited, and while we waited were content to bear the insults and aggressions of the whole earth — knowing the day of vengeance was not far off — was to be to Judea more than Aurelian to Rome. He was to be our prophet, our priest, and our king all in one; not man only, but the favored and beloved of God, his Son; and his empire was not to be like this of Rome, hemmed in by this sea and that, hedged about by barbarians on this side and another, bounded by rivers and hills, but was to stretch over the habitable earth, and Rome itself to be swallowed up in the great possession as a little island in the sea. And then this great kingdom was never to end. It could not be diminished by an enemy taking from it this province and another, as with Rome, nor could there be out of it any power whatever that could assail it, for by the interference of God, through the right arm of our great Prince, fear and the very spirit of submission were to fall on every heart. All was to be Judea's, and Judea's forever; the kingdom was to be over the whole earth; and the reign forever and ever. And in those ages peace was to be on the earth, and universal love. God was to be worshipped by all according to our law, and idolatry and error cease and come to an end. In this hope, I say, we were happy, in spite of all our vexations. In every heart in our land, whatever sorrows or sufferings might betide, there was a little corner where the spirit could retire and comfort itself with this vision of futurity. Among all the cities of our land, and far away among the rocks and vallies by Jordan and the salt sea, and the mountains of Lebanon, there were no others to be found than men, women, and children, happy in this belief, and by it bound into one band of lovers and friends. And what think you happened? I need not tell you. There came, as thou knowest, this false prophet of Gallilee, and beguiled the people with his smooth words, and perverted the sense of the prophets, and sowed difference and discord among the people; and the cherished vision, upon which the nation had lived and grown, fled like a dream. The Gallilean impostor planted himself upon the soil, and his roots of poison struck down, and his broad limbs shot abroad, and half the nation was lost. Its unity was gone, its peace was gone, its heart broken, its hope, though living still, yet obscured and perplexed. Canst thou wonder then, Piso, or thou, thou weeping princess, that the Jew stands by and laughs when the Christian's turn comes, and the oppressor is oppressed, the destroyer destroyed? And when, Piso, the Christian had done his worst, despoiling us of our faith, our hope, our prince and our God; not satisfied, he brought the Roman upon us, and despoiled us of our country itself. Now, and for two centuries all has been gone. Judea, the beautiful land, sits solitary and sad. Her sons and daughters wanderers over the earth, and trodden into the dust. When shall the light arise! and he, whom we yet look for, come and turn back the flood that has swept over us, and reverse the fortunes befallen to one and the other? The chariot of God tarries; but it does not halt. The wheels are turning, and when it is not thought of, it will come rolling onward with the voice of many thunders, and the great restorations shall be made, and a just judgment be meted out to all. What wonder I say then, Piso, if my people look on and laugh, when this double enemy is in straits? when the Christian and Roman, in one is caught in the snare and cannot escape? That laugh will ring through the streets of Rome, and will out-sound the roaring of the lions and the shouts of the theatre. Nature is strong in man, Piso, and I do not believe thou wilt think the worse of our people, if bearing what they have, this nature should break forth. Hate them not altogether, Roman, when thou shalt see them busy at the engines or the stake, or the theatres. Remember the cause! Remember the cause! But we are not all such. I wish, Piso, thou couldst abandon this faith. There will else be no safety to thee I fear ere not many days. What has overtaken the lady Aurelia, of the very family of the emperor, will surely overtake others. Piso, I would fain serve thee if I may. Though I hate the Roman, and the Christian, and thee, as a Jew, yet so am I, that I cannot hate them as a man, or not unto death; and thee do I love. Now it is my counsel that thou do in season escape. Now thou canst do it; wait but a few days and perhaps thou canst no longer. What I say is, fly! and it were best to the farthest east; first to Palmyra, and then, if need be, to Persia. This, Piso, is what I am come for.' `Isaac, this all agrees with the same goodness —' `I am a poor, miserable wretch, whom God may forgive, because his compassions never fail, but who has no claim on his mercy, and will be content to sit hereafter where he shall but just catch now and then a glimpse of the righteous.' `I must speak my thoughts, not yours, Isaac. This all agrees with what we have known of you; and with all our hearts you have our thanks. But we are bound to this place by ties stronger than any that bind us to life, and must not depart.' `Say not so! Lady, speak! Why should ye remain to add to the number that must fall? Rank will not stand in the way of Aurelian.' `That we know well, Isaac,' said Julia. `We should not look for any shield such as that to protect us, nor for any other. Life is not the chief thing, Isaac. What is life without liberty? Would you live a slave? and is not he the meanest slave, who bends his will to another? who renounces the thoughts he dearly cherishes, for another's humor? Who will beggar the soul to save or serve the body? `Alas, princess, I fear there is more courage in thee, woman as thou art, than in this old frame! I love my faith too, princess, and I labor for it in my way; but may the God of Abraham spare me from the last trial! And wouldst thou give up thy body to the tormentors and the executioner, to keep the singleness of thy mind, so that merely a few little thoughts, which no man can see, may run in and out of it as they list?' `Even so, Isaac.' `It is wonderful,' exclaimed the Jew, `what a strength there is in man! how for an opinion, which can be neither bought nor sold, nor weighed, nor handled, nor seen; a thing that, by the side of lands, and gold, and houses, seems less than the dust of the balance, men and women, yea, and little children, will suffer and die, when a word too, which is but a little breath blown out of the mouth, would save them!' `But it is no longer wonderful,' said Julia, `when we look at our whole selves, and not only at one part. We are all double, one part of earth, another of heaven; one part gross body, the other etherial spirit; one part life of the body, the other life of the soul. Which of these parts is the better, it is not hard to determine. Should I gain much by defiling the heavenly, for the sake of the earthly? by injuring the mind for the preservation of the body; by keeping longer the life I live now, and darkening over the prospect of the life that is hereafter? If I possess a single truth, which I firmly believe to be a truth, I cannot say that it is a lie, for the sake of some present benefit or deliverance, without fixing a stain thereby, not on the body which by and by perishes, but on the soul which is immortal; and which should forever bear about with it the unsightly spot. `It is so; it is as you say, lady; and rarely has the Jew been known to deny his name and his faith. Since you have spoken, I find thoughts called up which have long slept. Despise me not, for my proposal, yet I would there were a way of escape! Flight now would not be denial nor apostacy?' `It would not,' said I. `And we may not judge with harshness those whose human courage fails them under the apprehension of the horrible sufferings which often await the persecuted. But with my convictions, and Piso's, the guilt and baseness of flight or concealment would be little less than that of denial or apostacy. We have chosen this religion for its divine truth and its immortal prospects; we believe it a good which God has sent to us; we believe it the most valuable possession we hold; we believe it essential to the world's improvement and happiness. Believing it thus, we must stand by it; and if it come to this — as I trust in Heaven it will not, notwithstanding the darkness of the portents — that our regard for it will be questioned except we die for it — then we will die.' Isaac rose and began to fasten on his pack. As he did so, he said, `Excellent lady, I grieve that thou shouldst be brought from thy far home, and those warm and sunny skies, to meet the rude shocks of this wintry land. It was enough to see what thou didst there, and to know what befell thy ancient friends. The ways of Providence to our eyes are darker than the Egyptian night, brought upon that land by the hand of Moses. It is darkness solid and impenetrable. The mole sees farther toward the earth's centre, than does my dim eye VOL. I. 20 into the judgments of God. And what wonder? when he is God looking down upon earth and man's ways as I upon an ant-hill, and seeing all at once. To such an eye, lady, that may be best which to mine is worst.' `I believe it is often so, Isaac,' replied Julia. `Just as in nauseous drugs or rankest poisons there is hidden away medicinal virtue, so is there spiritual balm for the soul by which its worst diseases are healed and its highest health promoted, in sufferings which, as they first fall upon us, we lament as unmitigated evil. I know of no state of mind so proper to beings like us, as that indicated by a saying of Christ, which I shall repeat to you, though you honor not its source, and which seems to me to comprehend all religion and philosophy, “Not my will, but thine, O God, be done!” We never take our true position, and so never can be contented and happy till we renounce our own will, and believe all the whole providence of God to be wisest and best, simply because it is his. Should I dare, were the power this moment given me, to strike out for myself my path in life, arrange its events, fix my lot? Not the most trivial incident can be named that I should not tremble to order otherwise than as it happens.' `There is wisdom, princess, in the maxim of thy prophet, and its spirit is found in many of the sayings of truer prophets who went before him, and whose words are familiar to thy royal mother, though I fear they are not to thee; a misfortune wholly to be traced to that misadventure of thine, Piso, in being thrown into the company of the Christian Probus on board the Mediterranean trader. Had I been alone with thee on that voyage, who can say that thou wouldst not now have been what but this morning I took thee for, as I looked upon those marble figures?' `But, Isaac, forget not your own principles,' said Julia. `May you who cannot, as you have said, see the end from the beginning, and whose sight is but a mole's, dare to complain of the providence which threw Piso into the society of the Christian Probus? I am sure you would not, on reflection, re-arrange those events, were it now permitted you. And seeing, Isaac, how much better things are ordered by the Deity than we could do it, and how we should choose voluntarily to surrender all into his hands, whose wisdom is so much more perfect, and whose power is so much more vast, than ours, ought we not, as a necessary consequence of this, to acquiesce in events without complaint, when they have once occurred? If Providence has made both Piso and Probus Christians, then ought you not to complain, but acquiesce; and more than that, revere the Providence that has done it, and love those none the less whom it has directed into the path in which it would have them go. True piety is the mother of charity.' `Princess,' rejoined Isaac, `you are right. The true love of God cannot exist without making us true lovers of man; and Piso I do love, and think none the worse of him for his Christian name. But touching Probus and others I experience some difficulty. Yet may I perhaps escape thus — I may love them as men, yet hate them as Christians; just as I would bind up the wounds of a thief or an assassin whom I found by the wayside, and yet the next hour bear witness against him, and without compunction behold him swinging upon the gibbet! It is hard, lady, for the Jew to love a Christian and a Roman. — But how have I been led away from what I wished chiefly to say before departing! When I spake just now of the darkness of Providence, I was thinking, Piso, of my journey across the desert for thy Persian brother Calpurnius. That, as I then said to thee, was dark to me. I could not comprehend how it should come to pass that I, a Jew, of no less zeal than Simon Ben Gorah himself, should tempt such dangers in the service of thee, a Roman and half a Christian.' `And is the enigma solved at length?' asked Julia. `I could have interpreted it by saying that the merit of doing a benevolent action was its solution.' `That was little or nothing, princess. But I confess to thee that the two gold talents of Jerusalem were much. Still neither they, nor what profit I made in the streets of Ecbatana, and even out of that new Solomon the hospitable Levi, clearly explained the riddle. I have been in darkness till of late. And how think you the darkness has been dispersed?' `We cannot tell.' `I believe not. Piso! princess! I am the happiest man in Rome.' `Not happier, Isaac, than Civilis the perfumer.' `Name him not, Piso. Of all the men — he is no man — of all the living things in Rome I hold him meanest. Him, Piso, I hate. Why, I will not tell thee, but thou mayest guess. Nay, not now. I would have thee first know why I am the happiest man in Rome. Remember you the woman and the child, whom in the midst of that burning desert we found sitting more dead than alive at the roots of a cedar? the wife, as we afterwards found, of Hassan the camel-driver; and how that child, the living resemblance of my dead Joseph, wound itself round my heart, and how I implored the mother to trust it to me as mine and I would make it richer than the richest of Ecbatana?' `We remember it all well.' `Well, rejoice with me! Hassan is dead!' `Rejoice in her husband's death? Nay, that we cannot do. Milo will rejoice with thee.' `Rejoice with me then that Hassan, being dead by the providence of God, Hagar and Ishmael are now mine!' — and the Jew threw down his pack again in the excess of his joy, and strode wildly about the portico. `This is something indeed,' said Julia. `Now we can rejoice sincerely with you. But how happened all this? When and how have you obtained the news?' `Hassan,' replied Isaac, `as Providence willed it, died in Palmyra. His disconsolate widow, hearing of his death, in her poverty and affliction bethought herself of me, and applied for intelligence of me to Levi; from whom a letter came, saying that Hagar had made now on her part the proposal that had once been made on mine — that Ishmael should be mine provided he was not to be separated from his mother and a sister older than he by four years. I indeed proposed not for the woman, but for the child only — nor for the sister. But they will all be welcome. They must by this be in Palmyra on their way to Rome. Yes, they will be all welcome! for now once more shall the pleasant bonds of a home hold me, and the sounds of children's voices sweeter to my ear than will ever be the harps of angels VOL. I. 20* though Gabriel sweep the strings. Already in the street Janus, where our tribe most resort, have I purchased me a house; not, Roman, such a one as I dwelt in in Palmyra, where thou and thy foolish slave searched me out, but large and well-ordered, abounding with all that woman's heart could most desire. And now what think you of all this? whither tends it? to what leads all this long and costly preparation? what think you is to come of it? I have my own judgment. This I know, it cannot be all for this, that a little child of a few years should come and dwell with an old man little removed from the very borders of the grave! Had it been only for this, so large and long a train of strange and wild events would not have been laid. This child, Piso, is more than he seems! take that and treasure it up. It is to this the finger of God has all along pointed. He is more than he seems! What he will be I say not, but I can dimly — nay clearly guess. And his mother! Piso, what will you think when I say that she is a Jewess! and his father — what will you think when I tell you that he was born upon the banks of the Gallilean lake? that misfortunes and the love of a wandering life drew him from Judea to the farther East, and to a temporary and but apparent apostacy, I am persuaded, from his proper faith? This to me is all wonderful. Never have I doubted, that by my hand, by me as a mediator some great good was to accrue to Jerusalem. And now the clouds divide, and my eye sees what has been so long concealed. It shall all come to pass, before thy young frame, princess, shall be touched by years.' `We wish you all happiness and joy, Isaac,' replied Julia; `and soon as this young family shall have reached your dwelling, we shall trust to see them all, specially this young object of thy great expectations.' Isaac again fastened on his pack, and taking leave of us turned to depart, but ere he did so, he paused — fixed his dark eyes upon us — hesitated — and then said, `Lady, if trouble flow in upon you here in Rome, and thou wilt not fly as I have counseled to Palmyra; but thou shouldst by and by change thy mind and desire safety, or Piso should wish thee safe — perhaps that by thy life thou mightest work more mightily for thy faith than thou couldst do by thy death — for oftentimes it is not by dying that we best serve God, but by living — then bethink thee of my dwelling in the street Janus, where, if thou shouldst once come, I would challenge all the blood-hounds in Rome, and what is more and worse, Fronto and Varus leagued, to find thee. Peace be with you.' And so saying, he quickly parted from us. All Rome, Fausta, holds not a man of a larger heart than Isaac the Jew. For us, Christians as we are, there is I believe no evil to himself he would not hazard, if in no other way he could shield us from the dangers that impend. In his conscience he feels bound to hate us, and often from the language he uses it might be inferred that he does so. But in any serious expression of his feelings his human affections ever obtain the victory over the obligations of hatred which his love of country as he thinks imposes upon him, and it would be difficult for him to manifest a warmer regard toward any of his own tribe than he does toward Julia and myself. He is firmly persuaded that providence is using him as an instrument by which to effect the redemption and deliverance of his country; not that he himself is to prove the messiah of his nation — as they term their great expected prince — but that through him, in some manner, by some service rendered or office filled, that great personage will manifest himself to Israel. No disappointment damps his zeal, or convinces him of the futility of expectations resting upon no other foundation than his own inferences, conjectures, or fanciful interpretation of the dark sayings of the prophets. When in the East, it was through Palmyra that his country was to receive her king; through her victories that redemption was to be wrought out for Israel. Being compelled to let go that dear and cherished hope, he now fixes it upon this little “Joseph,” and it will not be strange if this child of poverty and want should in the end inherit all his vast possessions, by which he will please himself with thinking he can force his way to the throne of Judea. Portia derives great pleasure from his conversation, and frequently detains him long for that purpose, and of her Isaac is never weary of uttering the loudest and most extravagant praise. I sometimes wonder that I never knew him before the Mediterranean voyage, seeing he was so well known to Portia; but then again I do not, when I remember by what swarms of mendicants, strangers, and impostors of every sort, Portia was ever surrounded, from whom I turned instinctively away; especially did I ever avoid all intercourse with Christians and Jews. I held them, of all, lowest and basest. We are just returned from Tibur, where we have enjoyed many pleasant hours with Zenobia. Livia was there also. The day was in its warmth absolutely Syrian, and while losing ourselves in the mazes of the queen's extensive gardens, we almost fancied ourselves in Palmyra. Nicomachus being of the company, as he ever is, and Vabalathus, we needed but you, Calpurnius, and Gracchus, to complete the illusion. The queen devotes herself to letters. She is rarely drawn from her favorite studies but by the arrival of friends from Rome. Happy for her is it that, carried back to other ages by the truths of history, or transported to other worlds by the fictions of poetry, the present and the recent can be in a manner forgotten; or at least that in these intervals of repose the soul can gather strength for the thoughts and recollections which will intrude, and which still sometimes overmaster her. Her correspondence with you is another chief solace. She will not doubt that by and by a greater pleasure awaits her, and that instead of your letters she shall receive and enjoy yourself.

      <field name="fulltext">LETTER VII. FROM PISO TO FAUSTA. The body of the Christians, as you may well suppose, Fausta, is in a state of much agitation. Though they cannot discern plainly the form of the danger that impends, yet they discern it; and the very obscurity in which it is involved perhaps adds to their fears. It is several days since I last wrote, yet not a word has come from the palace. Aurelian is seen as usual in all public places; at the capitol; taking charge of the erection and completion of various public edifices; or if at the palace he rides as hard as ever and as much upon his Hippodrome; or if at the Pretorian camp, he is exact and severe as ever in maintaining the discipline of the Legions. He has issued no public order of any kind that bears upon us. Yet not only the Christians, but the whole city, stand as if in expectation of measures of no little severity, going at least to the abridgement of many of our liberties, and to the deprivation of many privileges. This is grounded chiefly doubtless upon the reported imprisonment of Aurelia; for though some have little hesitation in declaring their belief that she has been made way with, others believe it not at all, and none can assign a reason for receiving one story rather than another. How Isaac came to be possessed of his information I do not know, but it bore all the marks of truth. He would inform me neither how he came by it, nor would he allow it to be communicated. But it would never be surprising to discover, that of my most private affairs he has a better knowledge than myself. Do not, from what I have said, conceive of the Christians as giving any signs of unmanly fear. They perceive that danger threatens, but they change not their manner of life, nor turn from the daily path of their pursuits. Believing in a providence, they put their trust in it. Their faith stands them in stead as a sufficient support and refuge. They cannot pretend, any more than Isaac, to see through the plans and purposes of Heaven. They pretend not to know, nor to be able to explain to another, why, if what they receive is the truth and they are true believers in a true religion, they should be exposed to such sufferings for its sake; and that which is false, and injurious as false, should triumph. It is enough for them, they say, to be fully persuaded; to know and possess the truth. They can never relinquish it; they will rather die. But whether Christianity die with them or not they cannot tell — that they leave to God. They do not believe that it will — prophecy and the present condition of the world notwithstanding a present overhanging cloud, give them confidence in the ultimate extension and power of their faith. At any rate it shall receive no injury at their hands. They have professed it during twenty years of prosperity and have boasted of it before the world — they shall profess it with the same boldness and the same grateful attachment now that adversity approaches. They are fixed — calm — unmoved. Except for a deeper tone of earnestness and feeling when you converse with them, and a cast sadness upon the countenance, you would discern no alteration in their conduct or manner. I might rather say that in a very large proportion there are observable the signs of uncommon and almost unnatural exhilaration. They even greet the coming of trouble as that which shall put their faith to the test, shall give a new testimony of the readiness of Christians to suffer, and like the former persecution, give it a new impulse forwards. They seek occasions of controversy and conversation with the Pagans at public places, at their labor, and in the streets. The preachers assume a bolder, louder tone, and declaim with ten times more vehemence than ever against the enormities and abominations of the popular religions. Often at the market-places, and at the corners of the streets, are those to be seen, not authorized preachers perhaps, but believers and overflowing with zeal, who at the risk of whatever popular fury and violence hold forth the truth in Christ and denounce the reigning idolatries and superstitions. At the head of these is Macer; at their head both as respects the natural vigor of his understanding and the perfect honesty and integrity of his mind, and his dauntless courage. Every day, and all the day, is he to be found in the streets of Rome, sometimes in one quarter, sometimes in another, gathering an audience of the passengers or idlers, as it may be, and sounding in their ears the truths of the new religion. That he, and others of the same character, deserve in all they do the approbation of the Christian body, or receive it, is more than can be said. They are often by their violences in the midst of their harrangues, by harsh and uncharitable denunciations, by false and exaggerated statements, the causes of tumult and disorder, and contribute greatly to increase the general exasperation against us. With them it seems to be a maxim that all means are lawful in a good cause. Nay, they seem rather to prefer the ruder and rougher forms of attack. They seem possessed of the idea that the world is to be converted in a day and that if men will not at once relinquish the prejudices or the faith of years, they are fit but for cursings and burnings. In setting forth the mildest doctrine the world ever knew, delivered to mankind by the gentlest, and most patient, and compassionate being it ever saw, they assume a manner and use a language so entirely at variance with their theme, that it is no wonder if prejudices are strengthened oftener than they are set loose, incredulity made more incredulous, and the hardened heart yet harder. They who hear notice the discrepancy, and fail not to make the use of it they may. When will men learn that the mind is a fortress that can never be taken by storm? You may indeed enter it rudely, and by violence, and the signs of submission shall be made: but all the elements of opposition are still there. Reason has not been convinced; errors and misconceptions have not been removed, by a wise and logical and humane dealing, and supplanted by truths well proved and shown to be truths — and the victory is one in appearance only. And the mere show of violence, on the part of the reformer and assailant, begets violence on the other side. The whole inward man, with all his feelings, prejudices, reason, is instantly put into a posture of defence; not only of defence, for that were right, but of angry defence, which is wrong. Passion is up, which might otherwise have slept; and it is passion, never reason, which truth has to fear. The intellect in its pure form, the advocate VOL. I. 21 of truth would always prefer to meet, for he can never feel sure of a step made till this has been gained. But intellect, inflamed by passion, he may well dread, as what there is but small hope even of approaching, much less of convincing. Often has Probus remonstrated with this order of men, but in vain. They heed him not, but in return charge him with coldness and indifference, worldliness, and all other associated faults. Especially has he labored to preserve Macer from the extremes to which he has run; for he has seen in him as able advocate of Christian truth, could he but be moderated and restrained. But Macer, though he has conceived the strongest affection for Probus, will not allow himself in this matter to be influenced by him. He holds himself answerable to conscience and God alone for the course he pursues. As for the consequences that may ensue, either to himself or his family, his mind cannot entertain them. It is for Christ he lives, and for Christ he is ready to die. I had long wished to meet him and witness his manner both of acting and of acting and yesterday I was fortunate enough to encounter him. I shall give you, as exactly as I can, what took place; it will show you better than many letters could do what in one direction our position is and our prospects are. I was in the act of crossing the great avenue which on the south leads to the Forum, when I was arrested by a disorderly crowd, such as we often see gathered suddenly in the street of a city about a thief who has been caught, or a person who has been trodden down on the pavement. It moved quickly in the direction of the tribunal of Varus, and what was my surprise to behold Macer in the midst with head aloft and inflamed countenance holding in his grasp and dragging onwards one who would willingly have escaped. The crowd seemed disposed, as I judged by the vituperations that were directed against Macer to interfere, but were apparently deterred by both the gigantic form of Macer and their vicinity to the tribunal, whither he was going. Waiting till they were some distance in advance of me, I then followed, determined to judge for myself of this singular man. I was with them in the common hall before the prefect had taken his seat. When seated at his tribunal he inquired the cause of the tumult, and who it was that wished to appeal to him. `I am the person,' said Macer; `and I come to drag to justice this miscreant —' `And who may you be?' `I should think Varus might recognize Macer.' `It is so long since I met thee last at the emperor's table, that thy features have escaped me.' At which, as was their duty, the attendant rabble laughed. `Is there any one present,' continued the prefect, `who knows this man?' `Varus need apply to no other than myself,' said Macer. `I am Macer, the son of that Macer who was neighbor of the gladiator Pollex, —' `Hold, I say,' interrupted the prefect; `a man witnesses not here of himself. Can any one here say that this man is not crazy or drunk?' `Varus! prefect Varus —' cried Macer, his eyes flashing lightning and his voice not less than thunder; but he was again interrupted. `Peace, slave! or rods shall teach thee where thou art.' And at the same moment, at a sign from Varus, he was laid hold of with violence by officials of the place armed with spears and rods, and held. `What I wish to know then,' said Varus, turning to the crowd, `is, whether this is not the street brawler, one of the impious Gallileans, a man who should long ago have been set in the stocks to find leisure for better thoughts?' Several testified, as was desired, that this was he. `This is all I wish to know,' said the prefect. `The man is either without wits, or they are disordered, or else the pestilent faith he teaches has made the nuisance of him he is, as it does of all who meddle with it. It is scarcely right that he should be abroad. Yet has he committed no offence that condemns him either to scourging or the prison. Hearken therefore, fellow! I now dismiss thee without the scourging thou well deservest; but if thou keep on thy wild and lawless way, racks and dungeons shall teach thee what there is in Roman justice. Away with him!' `Romans! Roman citizens!' cried Macer; `are these your laws and this your judge? —' `Away with him, I say!' cried the prefect; and the officers of the palace hurried him out of the hall. As he went, a voice from the crowd shouted, `Roman citizens, Macer, are long since dead. 'T is a vain appeal.' `I believe you,' replied Macer; `tyrant and slave stand now for all who once bore the proud name of Roman.' This violence and injustice on the part of Varus must be traced — for though capricious and imperious, this is not his character — to the language of Macer in the shop of Publius, and to his apprehension lest the same references to his origin, which he would willingly have forgotten, should be made, and perhaps more offensively still, in the presence of the people. Probus, on the former occasion, lamented deeply that Macer should have been tempted to rehearse in the way he did some of the circumstances of the prefect's history, as its only end could be to needlessly irritate the man of power, and raise up a bitterer enemy than we might otherwise have found in him. Upon leaving the tribunal, I was curious to watch still further the movements of the Christian. The crowd about him increased rather than diminished, as he left the building and passed into the street. At but a little distance from the hall of the prefect stands the Temple of Peace, with its broad and lofty flights of steps. When Macer had reached it he paused and looked round upon the motley crowd that had gathered about him. `Go up! go up!' cried several voices. `We will hear thee.' `There is no prefect here,' cried another. Macer needed no urging, but quickly strode up the steps till he stood between the central columns of the temple, and his audience had disposed themselves below him in every direction, when he turned and gazed upon the assembled people, who had now, by the addition of such as passed along, and who had no more urgent business than to attend to that of any others whom they might chance to meet, grown to a multitude. After looking upon them for the space of a minute, as if VOL. I. 21* studying their characters, and how he could best adapt his discourse to their occasions, he suddenly and abruptly broke out — `You have asked me to come up here; and I am here; glad for once to be in such a place by invitation. And now I am here, and am about to speak to you, you will expect me to say something of the Christians.' `Yes, yes.' `But I shall not — not yet. Perhaps by and by. In the meantime my theme shall be the prefect! the prefect Varus!' `A subject full of matter,' cried one near Macer. `Better send for him,' said another. `'T were a pity he lost it.' `Yes,' continued Macer, `it is a subject full ofmatter, and I wish myself he were here to see himself in the mirror I would hold before him; he could not but grow pale with affright. You have just had a sample of Roman justice! How do you like it, Romans? I had gone there to seek justice; not for a Christian, but against a Christian. A Christian master had abused his slave with cruelty, I standing by; and when to my remonstrance — myself feeling the bitter stripes he laid on — he did but ply his thongs the more, I seized the hardened monster by the neck, and wrenching from his grasp the lash, I first plied it upon his own back and then dragged him to the judgment-seat of Varus, —' `O fool!' `You say well — fool that I was, crying for justice! How I was dealt with, some of you have seen. There, I say, was a sample of Roman justice for you! So in these times does power sport itself with poverty. It was not so once in Rome. Were Cincinnatus or Regulus at the tribunal of Varus, they would fare like the soldier Macer. And who, Romans, is this Varus? and why is he here in the seat of authority? At the tribunal, Varus did not know me. But what if I were to tell you there was but a thin wall between the rooms where we were born, and that when we were boys we were ever at the same school! — not such schools as you are thinking of, where the young go for letters and for Greek, but the school where many of you have been and are now at I dare say, the school of Roman vice, which you may find always open all along the streets, but especially where I and Varus were, in one of the sinks near the Flavian. Pollex the gladiator was father of Varus! — not worse, but just as bad, as savage, as beastly in his vices, as are all of that butcher tribe. My father — Macer too — I will not say more of him than that he was keeper of the vivaria of the amphitheatre, and passed his days in caging and uncaging the wild beasts of Asia and Africa; in feeding them when there were no games on foot, and starving them when there were. Varus the prefect, Romans, and I were at this school till I joined the legions under Valerian, and he, by a luckier fortune as it would be deemed, found favor in the eyes of Gallienus, to whom, with his fair sister Fannia, he was sold by those demons Pollex and Cæcina. I say nothing of how it fared with him in that keeping. Fannia has long since found the grave. Is Varus one who should sit at the head of Rome? He is a man of blood, of crime, of vice, such as you would not bear to be told of! I say not this as if he were answerable for his birth and early vice, but that, being such, this is not his place. He could not help it, nor I, that we were born and nurtured where we were; that the sight of blood and the smell of it, either of men or beasts, was never out of our eyes and nostrils, during all our boyhood and youth; that to him and me the sweetest pleasure of our young life was when the games came on and the beasts were let loose upon one another; and, O the hardening of that life! when especially there were prisoners or captives, on which to glut their raging hunger! Those were the days and hours marked whitest in our calendar. And whitest of all were the days of the Decian persecution, when the blood of thrice cursed Christians, as I was taught to name them, flowed like water. Every day then Varus and I had our sport; working up the beasts by our torments to an unnatural height of madness ere they were let loose, and then rushing to the gratings, as the doors were thrown open, to see the fury with which they would spring upon their defenceless victims and tear them piecemeal. The Romans required such servants — and we were they. They require them now, and you may find any number of such about the theatres. But if there must be such there, why should they be taken thence and put upon the judgment-seat? save for the reason that they may have been thoroughly purged as it were by fire — which Varus has not. What with him was necessary and forced when young, is now chosen and voluntary. Vice is now his by election. Now I ask why has the life of Varus been such? and why, being such, is he here? Because you are so! Yes, because you are all like him! It is you, Roman citizens, who rear the theatres, the circuses, and the thousand temples of vice, which crowd the streets of Rome, —' `No, no! it is the emperors.' `But who made the emperors? You Romans of these times, are a race of cowards and slaves, and it is therefore that tyrants rule over you. Were you freemen, with the souls of freemen in you, do you think you would bear as you do — and love and glory in the yoke— this rule of such creatures as Varus, and others whom it were not hard to name? I know what you are — for I have been one of you. I have not been, nor am I now, hermit, as you may think, being a Christian. A Christian is a man of the world — a man of action and of suffering — not of rest and sleep. I have ever been abroad among men, both before I was a Christian and since; and I know what you are. You are of the same stamp as Varus! nay, start not, nor threaten with your eyes, — I fear you not. If you were not so, why, I say, is Varus there? You know that I speak the truth. The people of Rome are corrupt as their rulers! How should it be much otherwise? You are fed by the largesses of the emperor, you have your two loaves a day and your pork, and you need not and so do not work. You have no employment but idleness, and idleness is not so much a vice itself as the prolific mother of all vices. When I was one of you, it was so; and so it is now. My father's labor was nothing; he was kept by the state. The emperor was not more a man of pleasure than he, nor the princes, than I and Varus. Was that a school of virtue? When I left the service of the amphitheatre I joined the Legions. In the army I had work, and I had fighting, but my passions, in the early days of that service, raged like the sea; and during all the reign of Valerian's son there was no bridle upon them; — for I served under the general Carinus, and what Carinus was and is, most of you know. O the double horrors of those years! I was older, and yet worse and worse. God! I marvel that thou didst not interpose and strike me dead! But thy mercy spared me, and now the lowest, lowest hell shall not be mine.' Tears forced by these recollections flowed down his cheeks, and for a time he was speechless. `Such, Romans, was I once. What am I now? I am a changed man — through and through. There is not a thought of my mind, nor a fibre of my body, what they were once. You may possibly think the change has been for the worse, seeing me thus thrust forth from the tribunal of the prefect with dishonor, when I was once a soldier and an officer under Aurelian. I would rather a thousand times be what I am, a soldier of Jesus Christ. And I would that by anything I could do, you, any one of you, might be made to think so too; I would that Varus might, for I bear him no ill will. `But what am I now? I am so different a man from what I once was, that I can hardly believe myself to be the same. The life which I once led, I would not lead again — no — not one day nor hour of it, though you would depose Aurelian to-day and crown me Cæsar to-morrow. I would no more return to that life, than I would consent to lose my nature and take a swine's, and find elysium where as a man I once did, in sinks and sties. I would not renounce for the wealth of all the world, and its empire too, that belief in the faith of Christ, the head of the Christians, which has wrought so within me. `And what has made me so — would make you so — if you would but hearken to it. And would it not be a good thing if the flood of vice, which pours all through the streets of Rome, were stayed? Would it not be a happy thing, if the misery which dwells beneath these vaulted roofs and these humbler ones equally, the misery which drunkenness and lust, the love of money, and the love of place, and every evil passion generates, were all wiped away, and we all lived together observant of the rights of one another, helping one another; not oppressing; loving, not hating; showing in our conduct as men, the virtues of little children? Would it not be happier if all this vast population were bound together by some common ties of kindred; if all held all as brethren; if the poor man felt himself to be the same as Aurelian himself, because he is a man like him and weighs just as much as he in the scales of God, and that it is the vice in the one or the other, and that only, that sinks him lower? Would it not be better, if you all could see in the presiding power of the universe, one great and good Being, who needs not to be propitiated by costly sacrifices of oxen or bulls, nor by cruel ones of men, — but is always kindly disposed towards you, and desires nothing so much as to see you living virtuously and happily, and is never grieved as he is to see you ruining your own peace, — not harming him — by your vices? for you will bear witness with me that your vices are never a cause of happiness. Would it not be better if you could behold such a God over you, in the place of those who are called gods, and whom you worship, as I did once, because I feared to do otherwise, and yet sin on never the less: who are your patterns not so much in virtue as in vice?' `Away with the wicked!' — `Away with the fellow!' cried several voices; but others predominated, saying, `Let him alone!' — `He speaks well! We will hear him!' — `We will defend him! go on, go on!' `I have little or nothing more to say,' continued Macer. `I will only ask you whether you must not judge that to be a very powerful principle of some kind that drew me up out of that foul pit into which I was fallen, and made me what I am now? Which of you now feels that he has motive strong enough to work out such a deliverance for him? What help in this way do you receive from your priests, if perchance you ever apply to them? What book of instructions concerning the will of the gods have you, to which you can go at any time and all times? Only believe as I do, Romans, and you will hate sin as I do. You cannot help it. Believe in the God that I do, and in the revealer of his will, the teacher whom he sent into the world to save us from our heathen errors and vices, and you will then be more than the Romans you once were. You are now, and you know it, infinitely less. Then you will be what the old Romans were and more. You will be as brave as they, and more just. You will be as generous and more gentle. You will love your own country as well, but you will love others too. You will be more ready to offer up your lives for your country, for it will be better worth dying for; every citizen will be a brother; every ruler a brother; it will be like dying for your own little household. If you would see Rome flourish she must become more pure. She can stagger along not much longer under this mountain weight of iniquity that presses her into the dust. She needs a new Hercules to cleanse her foul chambers. Christ is he; and if you will invite him, he will come and sweep away these abominations, so that imperial Rome shall smell fragrantly as a garden of spices.' Loud exclamations of approval here interrupted Macer. The great proportion of those who were present were now evidently with him, and interested in his communications. `Tell us,' cried one, as soon as the noise subsided, `how you became what you are? What is to be done?' `Yes,' cried many voices, `tell us.' `I will tell you gladly,' answered Macer. `I first heard the word of truth from the lips of Probus, a preacher of the Christians, whom you too may hear whenever you will, by seeking him out on the days when the Christians worship. Probus was in early life a priest of the temple of Jupiter, and if any man in Rome can place the two religions side by side, and make the differences plain, it is he. Go to him such of you as can, and you will never repent it. But if you would all learn the first step toward Christian truth, and all truth, it is this; lay aside your prejudices, be willing to bear, see, hear, and judge for yourselves. Take not rumor for truth. Do not believe without evidence both for and against. You would not, without evidence and reason, charge Aurelian with the death of Aurelia, though ten thousand tongues report it. Charge not the Christians with worse things then, merely because the wicked and ill-disposed maliciously invent them and spread them. If you would know the whole truth and doctrine of Christians; if you would ascend to the fountain-head of all Christian wisdom, take to your homes our sacred books and read VOL. I. 22 them. Some of you at least can obtain them. Let one purchase, and then twenty or fifty read. One thing before I cease. Believe not the wicked aspersions of the prefect. He charges me as a brawler, a disturber of the peace and order of the city. Romans, believe me, I am a lover of peace, but I am a lover of freedom too. Because I am a lover of peace, and would promote it, do I labor to teach the doctrines of Christ, which are doctrines of peace and love, both at home and abroad, in the city and throughout the world; and because I am the friend of freedom, do I open my mouth at all times and in every place, wherever I can find those who, like you, are ready to hear the words of salvation. When in Rome I can no longer speak — no longer speak for the cause of what I deem truth, then will I no longer be a Roman. Then will I that day renounce my name and my country. Thanks to Aurelian, he has never chained up the tongue. I have fought and bled under him, and never was there a braver man, or who honored courage more in others. I do not believe he will ever do so cowardly a thing as to restrain the freedom of men's speech. Aurelian is some things, but he is not others. He is severe and cruel, but not mean. Cut Aurelian in two, and throw the worser half away, and t' other is as royal a man as ever the world saw. `One thing more, good friends and citizens: If I am sometimes carried away by my passions to do that which seems a disturbance of the common order, say that it is the soldier Macer that does it, not his Christian zeal — his human passions, not his new-adopted faith. It is not at once and perfectly that a man passes from one life to another; puts off one nature and takes another. Much that belonged to Macer of the amphitheatre, and Macer the soldier, cleaves to him now. But make not his religion amenable for that. You who would see the law of Christ written, not only on a book but in the character and life of a living man, go read the Christian Probus.' As he said these words he began to descend the steps of the temple; but many crowded round him, assailing him, some with reproaches, and others with inquiries put by those who seemed anxious to know the truth. The voices of his opponents were most violent and prevailed, and made me apprehensive that they would proceed to greater length than speech. But Macer stood firm, nothing daunted by the uproar. One, who signalized himself by the loudness and fierceness of his cries, exclaimed, `that he was nothing else than an atheist like all the rest of the Christians; they have no gods; they deny the gods of Rome, and they give us nothing in their stead.' `We deny the gods of Rome, I know,' replied Macer, `and who would not, who had come to years of discretion? who had so much as left his nurse's lap? A fouler brotherhood than they the lords of Heaven, Rome does not contain. Am I to be called upon to worship a set of wretches chargeable with all the crimes and vices to be found on earth? It is this accursed idolatry, O Romans, that has sunk you so low in sin? They are your lewd, and drunken, and savage deities, who have taught you all your refinement in wickedness; and never, till you renounce them, never till you repent you of your iniquities — never till you turn and worship the true God will you rise out of the black Tartarean slough in which you are lying. These two hundred years and more has God called to you by his Son, and you have turned away your ears; you have hardened your hearts; the prophets who have come to you in his name have you slain by the sword or hung upon the accursed tree. Awake out of your slumbers! These are the last days. God will not forbear forever. The days of vengeance will come; they are now at hand: I can hear the rushing of that red right arm hot with wrath —' `Away with him! away with him!' broke from an hundred voices! — `Down with the blasphemer!' — `Who is he to speak thus of the gods of Rome?' — `Seize the impious Gallilean, and away with him to the prefect!' — These and a thousand exclamations of the same kind, and more savage, were heard on every side, and at the same moment, their denial and counter-exclamations from as many more. `He has spoken the truth!' — `He is a brave fellow!' — `He shall not be touched except we fall first!' — came from a resolute band who encompassed the preacher, and seemed resolved to make good their words by defending him against whatever assault might be made. Macer, himself a host in such an affray, neither spoke nor moved, standing upright and still as a statue; but any one might see the soldier in his kindling eye, and that a slight cause would bring him upon the assailants with a fury that would deal out wounds and death. He had told them that the old Legionary was not quite dead within him, and sometimes usurped the place of the Christian; this they seemed to remember, and after showering upon him vituperation and abuse in every form, one after another they withdrew and left him with those who had gathered immediately around him. These too soon took their leave of him, and Macer, unimpeded and alone, turned towards his home. When I related to Probus afterwards what I had heard and witnessed, he said that I was fortunate in hearing what was so much more sober and calm than what usually fell from him; that generally he devoted himself to an exposition of the absurdities of the heathen worship, and the abominations of the mysteries, and the vices of the priesthood; and he rarely ended without filling with rage a great proportion of those who heard him. Many a time had he been assaulted; and hardly had escaped with his life. You will easily perceive, Fausta, how serious an injury is inflicted upon us by rash and violent declaimers like Macer. There are others like him; he is by no means alone, though he is far the most conspicuous. Together they help to kindle the flame of active hostility, and infuse fresh bitterness into the Pagan heart. Should the emperor carry into effect the purposes now ascribed to him, these men will be sure victims, and the first. Upon my return after hearing Macer, I found Livia seated with Julia, to whom she often comes thus, and then together — I often accompanying — they visit Tibur. She had but just arrived. It was easy to see that the light-heartedness, which so manifested itself always in the beaming countenance and the elastic step, was gone; the usual signs of it at least were not visible. Her whole expression was serious and anxious; and upon her face were the traces of recent grief. For a long time, after the first salutations and inquiries were through, neither spoke. At length Livia said, VOL. I. 22* `I am come now, Julia, to escape from what has become of late little other than a prison. The Fabrician dungeons are not more gloomy than the gardens of Sallust are now. No more gaiety; no feasting by day and carousal by night; the gardens never illuminated; no dancing nor music. It is a new life for me: and then the only creatures to be seen, that hideous Fronto and the smiling Varus; men very well in their place, but no inmates of palaces.' `Well said, Julia; there is the greater reason why we should see more of each other and of Zenobia. Aurelian is the same?' `The same? There is the same form, and the same face, and the same voice; but the form is motionless, save when at the Hippodrome, — the face black as Styx, and his voice rougher than the raven's. That agreeable humor and sportiveness, which seem native to him, though by reason of his thousand cares not often seen, is now wholly gone. He is observant as ever of all the forms of courtesy, and I am to him what I have ever been; but a dark cloud has settled over him and all the house, and I would willingly escape if I could. And worse than all, is this of Aurelia! Alas, poor girl!' `And what, Livia, is the truth?' said Julia; `the city is filled with rumors but they are so at variance no one knows which to believe, or whether none.' `I hardly know myself,' replied Livia. `All I know with certainty is, that I have lost my only companion — or the only one I cared for — and that Aurelian merely says she has been sent to the prisons at the Fabrician bridge. I cannot tell you of our parting. Aurelia was sure something terrible was designed against her, from the sharpness and violence of her uncle's language, and she left me as if she were never to see me again. But I would believe no such thing, and so I told her, and tried to give to her some of the courage and cheerfulness which I pretended to have myself; but it was to no purpose. She departed weeping as if her heart were broken. I love her greatly, notwithstanding her usual air of melancholy and her preference of solitude, and I have found in her, as you know, my best friend and companion. Yet I confess there is that in her which I never understood, and do not now understand. I hope she will comply with the wishes of Aurelian, and that I shall soon see her again. The difficulty is all owing to this new religion. I wish, Julia, there were no such thing. It seems to me to do nothing but sow discord and violence.' `That, dear Livia,' said Julia, `is not a very wise wish; especially seeing you know, as you will yourself confess, so little about it.' `But,' quickly added Livia, `was it not better as it was at Palmyra? who heard then of these bitter hostilities? who were there troubled about their worship? One hardly knew there was such a thing as a Christian. When Paul was at the palace, it was still all the same; only, if anything, a little more agreeable. But here, no one at the gardens speaks of Christians but with an assassin air that frightens one. There must surely be more evil in them than I ever dreamed of.' `The evil, Livia,' answered her sister, `comes not from the Christians nor Christianity, but from those who oppose them. There were always Christians in Palmyra, and as you say even in the palace, yet there was always peace and good-will too. If Christianity were in itself an element of discord and division, why were no such effects seen there? The truth is, Livia, the division and discord are created, not by the new religion, but by those who resist it, and will not suffer people to act and think as they please about it. Under Zenobia all had free liberty to believe as they would. And there was under her the reign of universal peace and good-will. Here, on the other hand, it has been the practice of the state to interfere, and say what the citizens shall believe and whom they shall worship, and what and whom they shall not. How should it be otherwise than that troubles should spring up, under legislation so absurd and so wicked? Would it not be a certain way to introduce confusion, if the state — or Aurelian — should prescribe our food and drink? or our dress? And if confusion did arise, and bitter opposition, you could not justly say it was owing to the existence of certain kinds of food, or of clothes which people fancied, but to their being interfered with. Let them alone, and they will please themselves and be at peace.' `Yes,' said Livia, `that may be. But the common people are in no way fit judges in such things, and it seems to me if either party must give way, it were better the people did. The government has the power and they will use it.' `In so indifferent a matter as food or dress,' rejoined the sister, `if a government were so foolish as to make prohibitory and whimsical laws, it were better to yield than contend. But in an affair so different from that as one's religion, one could not act in the same way. I may dress in one kind of stuff as well as another; it is quite a possible thing: but is it not plainly impossible, if I think one kind of stuff is of an exquisite fineness and color, for me to believe and say at the same time, that its texture is coarse and its hue dull? The mind cannot believe according to any other laws than those of its own constitution. Is it not then the height of wickedness to set out to make people believe and act one way in religion? The history of the world has shown that, in spite of men's wickedness, there is nothing on earth they value as they do their religion. They will die rather than change or renounce it. Men are the same now. To require that any portion of the people shall renounce their religion is to require them to part with that which they value most — more than life itself — and is it not in effect pronouncing against them a sentence of destruction? Some indeed will relinquish it rather than die; and some will play the hypocrite for a season, intending to return to a profession of it in more peaceful times: But most, and the best, will die before they will disown their faith,' `Then if that is so,' said Julia, `and I confess what you say cannot be denied, I would that Aurelian could be prevailed upon to recede from a position which he seems to be taking. His whole nature now seems to have been set on fire by this priest Fronto. Superstition has wholly seized and possessed him. His belief is that Rome can never be secure and great till the enemies of the gods, as well as of the state, shall perish; and pushed on by Fronto he appears, so far as can be gathered from their discourse, to be bent on their destruction. I wish he could be changed back again to what he was before this notion seized him. Piso, have you seen him? Have you of late conversed with him?' `Only, Livia, briefly; and on this topic only at intervals of other talk; for he avoids it, at least with me. But from what we all know of Aurelian, it is not one's opinion nor another's that can alter his will when once bent one way.' `How little did I once deem,' said Livia, `when I used to wish so for greatness and empire, that they could be so darkened over. I thought that to be great was necessarily to be happy. But I was but a child then.' `How long since was that?' asked Julia, smiling. `Ah! you would say I am little better than that now.' `You are young yet, Livia, for much wisdom to have come; and you must not wonder if it come slowly, for you are unfortunately placed to gain it. An idol on its pedestal can rarely have but two thoughts — that it is an idol, and that it is worshipped. The entrance of all other wisdom is quite shut out.' `How pleasant a thing it is, Piso, to have an elder sister as wise as Julia! But come, will you to Tibur? I must have Faustula, now I have lost Aurelia.' `O no, Livia,' said Julia; `take her not away from Zenobia. She can ill spare her.' `But there is Vabalathus.' `Yes, but he is now little there. He is moreover preparing for his voyage. Faustula is her all.' `Ah, then it cannot be! It were very wrong, I see. Then I see not but I must go to her, or come live with you. Only think of one's trying to escape from the crown of Rome? I can hardly believe I am Livia; once never to be satisfied with power and greatness — now tired of them! No, not that exactly —' `You are tired, only, Livia, of some little attendant troubles; you like not that overhanging cloud you just spoke of; but for the empire itself, you love that none the less. To believe that, it is enough to see you.' `I suppose you are right. Julia is always right, Piso.' So our talk ran on; sometimes into graver and then into lighter themes — often stopping and lingering long over you, and Calpurnius, and Gracchus. You wished to know more of Livia and her thoughts, and I have given her to you in just the mood in which she happened to be. The wife of Macer has just been here, seeking from Julia both assistance and comfort. She implores us to do what we may to calm and sober her husband. `As the prospect of danger increases,' she said to Julia, `he grows but the more impetuous and ungovernable. He is abroad all the day and every day, preaching all over Rome, and brings home nothing for the support of the family; and if it were not for the empeperor's bounty, we should starve.' `And does that support you?' `O no, lady! it hardly gives us food enough to subsist upon. Then we have besides to pay for our lodging and our clothes. But I should mind not at all our labor nor our poverty, did I not hear from so many that my husband is so wild and violent in his preaching, and when he disputes with the gentiles, as he will call them. I am sure it is a good cause to suffer in, if one must suffer; but if our dear Macer would only work half the time, there would be no occasion to suffer — which we should now were it not for Demetrius the jeweler — who lives hard by, and who I am sure has been very kind to us — and our good ælia.' `You do not then,' I asked, `blame your religion nor weary of it?' `O, sir, surely not. It is our greatest comfort. We all look out with expectation of our greatest pleasure, when Macer returns home, after his day's labors; and labors they surely are, and will destroy him, unless he is persuaded to leave them off. For when he is at home the children all come round him, and he teaches them in his way what religion is. Sometimes it is a long story he gives them of his life, when he was a little boy and knew nothing about Christ, and what wicked things he did, and sometimes about his serving as a soldier under the emperor. But he never ends without showing them what Christ's religion tells them to think of such ways of life. And then, sir, before we go to bed he reads to us from the gospels — which he bought when he was in the army, and was richer than he is now — and prays for us all, for the city, and the emperor, and the gentiles. So that we want almost nothing, as I may say, to make us quite contented and happy.' `Have you ever been disturbed in your dwelling on Macer's account?' `O yes, sir, and we are always fearing it. This is our great trouble. Once the house was attacked by the people of the street, and almost torn down — and we escaped, I and the children, through a back way into the shop of the good Demetrius. There we were safe; and while we were gone our little cabin was entered, and everything in it broken in pieces. Macer was not at home, or I think he would have been killed.' `Did you apply to the perfect?' `No, sir, I do not believe there would be much use in that: they say he hates the Christians so.' `But he is bound to preserve order in the city.' `Yes, sir; but for a great man like him it's easy to see only one way, and to move so slowly that it does no good. That is what our people say of him. When the Christians are in trouble he never comes, if he comes at all, till it is too late to do them any service. The best way for us is I think to live quietly, and not needlessly provoke the gentiles, nor believe that we can make Christians of them all in a day. That is my husband's dream. He thinks that he must deliver his message to people, whether they will or not, and it almost seems as if the more hostile they were, the more he made it his duty to preach to them, which certainly was not the way in which Christ did, as he reads his history to us. It was just the other way. It almost makes me believe that some demon has entered into him, he is so different from what he was, and abroad from what he is at home. Do you think that likely, sir? I have been at times inclined to apply to Felix to see if he could not exorcise him.' `No, I do not think so, certainly; but many may. I believe he errs in his notion of the way in which to do good; but under some circumstances it is so hard to tell which the best way is, that we must judge charitably of one another. Some would say that Macer is right; others that the course of Probus is wisest; and VOL. I. 23 others that of Felix. We must do as we think right, and leave the issue to God.' `But you will come and see us? We dwell near the ruins, and behind the shop of Demetrius. Everybody knows Demetrius.' I assured her I would go. I almost wish, Fausta, that Julia was with you. All classes seem alike exposed to danger. But I suppose it would be in vain to propose such a step to her, especially after what she said to Isaac. You now, after your storm, live at length in calm: not exactly in sunshine; for you would say the sun never can seem to shine that falls upon the ruins of Palmyra. But calm and peace you certainly have, and they are much. I wish Julia could enjoy them with you. For here, every hour, so it now seems to me, the prospect darkens, and it will be enough for one of us to remain to encounter the evil, whatever it may be, and defend the faith we have espoused. This is an office more appropriate to man than to woman; though emergences may arise as they have when woman herself must forget her tenderness and put on soldiers' panoply; and when it has come, never has she been found wanting. Her promptness to believe that which is good and pure, has been equaled by her fortitude and patience in suffering for it. You will soon see Vabalathus. He will visit you before he enters upon his great office. By him I shall write to you soon again. Farewell. END OF VOLUME ONE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CATALOGUE OF NEW BOOKS FOR FAMILIES AND PRESENTS FOR YOUTH, PUBLISHED BY Munroe and Francis, NO. 128, WASHINGTON-STREET, BOSTON. The COOK'S OWN BOOK, and House-Keeper's Register, being a complete Culinary Encyclopædia: comprehending all valuable Receipts for cooking Meat, Fish, and Fowl; and composing every kind of Soup, Gravy, Pastry, Preserves, Essences, &amp;c. that have been known or invented to the present time, with numerous original Receipts, and a Complete System of Confectionery. By a Boston Housekeeper. To which is added, Miss Leslie's SEVENTY-FIVE RECEIPTS for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats. The whole alphabetically arranged. Also, Directions for the Management of Families, Cooking Utensils, Diet, Boiling, Baking, Roasting, Frying, Broiling, Broths and Soups; Observations on all articles used in Cookery, and how to keep them; Marketing Tables; Directions for Pickled Fish; Weights and Measures, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. “The cook exercises a greater power over the public health and welfare than the physician, and if he should be a charlatan in his art, alas! for his employers. Hitherto, or until of late years, the cook has had to educate himself, while the physician appropriates all the knowledge of antiquity, and of every succeeding age; his individual cases are all classed according to general principles, while the rules which have regulated the preparation of our food have been discordant and unnatural. In the present age, indeed, cookery has been raised to the dignity of an art, and sages have given their treatises to the world.—On the utilitarian principle the cook should be much elevated in human estimation, and were he to form a strict alliance with the physician, the patriarchal ages would return, and men would die of nothing but sheer old age.” “This book, by an excellent arrangement of its articles, and a judicious compactness of page and type, contains more reading in its 350 pages than are usually given in a thousand pages of other books, whilst its selling price is lower. Every recipe is plain, and the proportions certain; little is left to discretion, that could be reduced to measure; and every young housekeeper should make the volume their first purchase, giving it precedence even to the indispensable brass warming-pan, looking-glass, and iron pot. It is a guide to economy as well as perfection in the culinary art, and a suitable present to assistants in families for the benefit of the whole eating community.” “The late Mr. Abernethy referred almost all maladies to the stomach, and seldom prescribed any remedy but a proper diet. This it is the province of the cook to provide; and the design of this book to indicate. Every recipe in it (amounting to some four or five thousand) has been sanctioned by custom. The cook and the housekeeper have here a dictionary of reference, an encyclopædia of their art. The details are full, and the authority is perfect. There were various works of merit that it was useful for the cook to study, but here are collected the best parts of all, with the convenience of alphabetical arrangement, and in the compass of a single volume. If it is a sin to waste the best gifts of Providence, it should be little less than felony to spoil them. More than health depends on the preparation of our food: our very virtues are the creatures of circumstances, and many a man has hardened his heart, or given up a good resolution, under the operation of indigestion. The natural and moral world are reciprocally dependent; soul and body are so linked, that when one loses its tone, the other is deprived of its equanimity. The system of morals therefore becomes identified with that of cookery.” Life and Adventures of ROBINSON CRUSOE, of York, mariner, with an Account of his Travels round three Quarters of the Globe. Written by himself. With new Designs on wood by Anderson. pp. 600. square 16mo. being the whole complete edition, as written by the author. 22 plates. “To the Editor of the Courier. “Mr. Buckingham, “It is a sight to make my green spectacles glisten, to look at the shelves of Munroe &amp; Francis. They have changed the whole system of juvenile reading. Blue Beard and Tom Thumb have abdicated their high places in favour of better people, and a child, while he seeks only amusement, may now learn history, and the sciences, and avoid the silly tales that composed my own early library, and which haunt the memory for evil, like stories of ghosts and spectres in the nursery. If the children of the Commonwealth were to erect a monument to their greatest benefactors, you would find it inscribed to our friends at the corner of Water-Street. This may seem a strong assertion, but every schoolmaster, or parent that educates his own children, knows it to be but faint praise. You, I think, deserve well of your country, being the father of eight or ten sons; if, when the season of Christmas comes, you shell out (as we say in the cornfield) to the urchins with rosy cheeks, let them not make a profitless investment of half a dollar in a whistle, or statues of men and horses in sugar; but let them purchase a book, that if they read but once and throw it by, will yet leave a lasting impression on the mind. This is my course with the young Doolittles, who have already a miniature library of 87 volumes, and whose greatest treat it is to visit the bookstores of the publishers.” AMERICAN GIRL'S BOOK, or Occupation for Play Hours. By Miss Leslie, author of Atlantic Tales, &amp;c. &amp;c. “The American Girl's Book.—The person that makes a popular book for children is certain of having an extended reputation. The authors of Blue-Beard and Tom Thumb, whose names have not reached us, will yet survive to the latest posterity in their works. What a child reads he never forgets—the impressions thus made are as vivid as any that come through the senses. Of all sights there is not one so pleasing to a benevolent and pure mind as the games of children;</field>
