There is a small gray shield hanging from the branches of the tree, with three blue figures on that small shield.

Below the tree is a larger shield, with a black background, and with three gray, diagonal stripes across it; these diagonal stripes are referred to as bends in heraldic terms. There are three gold leaves in line, end-to-end, down the middle of the center stripe (or bend), with green veins in the leaves.

      <field name="fulltext">TO WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, Esq. IN TOKEN OF FRIENDSHIP AND ADMIRATION OF HIS GENIUS, THESE VOLUMES ARE DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">a PREFACE. The multiplication of books is the cause of much complaint, and it must be conceded that the inconvenience is not trivial to those who are, or suppose themselves, under an obligation to pay some attention to the current literature of the day. When however the matter is duly considered, it will be found that this inconvenience, like most others, is not an unmixed evil, but productive of many advantages. It is not a conclusive objection to a new book, that there are better ones already in existence that remain unread. The elements of human nature and human society remain the same, but their forms and combinations are changing at every moment, and nothing can be more different than the appearances and effects produced by the same original principles of human nature as exhibited in different countries, or at different periods of time in the same country. “Tempora mutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.” As times and manners change, it must be evident that attempts to describe them must be as constantly renewed and diversified. We are aware that apprehensions are entertained by many intelligent persons, that the stores of wisdom and knowledge which have been collected by our predecessors, will be neglected and forgotten through an insatiable appetite for novelty: but we think a 2 that such apprehensions are often carried too far. The acquisitions of knowledge, wisdom, or even wit, once made, are rarely lost, except by some of those great changes which, for the time, subvert the foundations of society. The original fountains may be remote and unknown; but the river laves our fields, and passes by to diffuse its treasures among other regions; and even if its waters are lost to our sight by evaporation, they descend again in showers to embellish and fructify the earth in a thousand forms. Just so it is with intellectual treasures. Very few persons now read the works of Aristotle, and not many those of Bacon: but the wisdom which they first taught, or perhaps collected, is now spread far and wide by numerous modes of diffusion, and is incorporated into the minds of thousands who know nothing of its origin: and we may even remark that one cannot turn over the pages of a modern jest book, or the files of a village newspaper, without meeting embodied in narratives of the incidents of the day, the essence of the same jokes which nearly two thousand years ago Cicero related for the amusement of his patrician friends. We have suggested these reflections with the double view of reconciling the lovers of former excellence to the invariable course of things, which ever did, and ever must, offer the present to our view in great magnitude and strong relief, and gather over the past the constantly increasing clouds of obscurity. There have been in ages past, and we trust there will be in future, individuals whose productions in spite of all changes of time and language, will command attention and respect; but the course of things nevertheless has been, that as society has advanced, each generation has drawn more and more upon its own a 3 immediate resources for intellectual amusement and instruction. If any doubt the propriety of these remarks as being applicable to the general course of knowledge and literature, they may yet be disposed to admit their justice so far as they relate to fictitious narrative. It is the peculiar province of that department to denote the passing character and manners of the present time and place. There is but one individual (whom it would be affectation to call unknown) who has had eminent success in the delineations of former periods, or what is called historical romance. “The folly of the moment” must be caught “as it flies.” The attractions of novelty are too numerous and too evident to require argument or detail for their elucidation. Every one knows that new books, and especially new novels, will be sought for and read, while those of more ancient date are disregarded. Many read them only because they are new, and to such they do not come in competition with any other description of reading, but are merely suffered to seize on a vacant hour which might otherwise be less profitably employed. We have dwelt at so much length and with so much complacency on the advantages and merits of novelty, because we are sure that our production will have that recommendation, and we are not sure that it will have any other —it certainly will be the last new novel. There are, however, some other considerations which have contributed to overcome our reluctance to appear before the public. The love and habit of reading have become so extensive in this country, and the tastes and wants of readers so various, that we cannot but indulge the hope that there will be found some who will derive amusement if not instruction from our humble efforts. We will, at least, venture to claim the negative merit often ascribed to simples—that if they can do no good, they will do no harm. A few words will be sufficient to indicate the design of these volumes. We have not composed a tale professedly or chiefly of a religious nature, as if left to the bias of our own inclination, we might possibly have done. We do not think that such attempts have heretofore been eminently successful; or that narrative sermons are of a nature to be particularly interesting. Still we are conscious that the religious principle, with all its attendant doubts, hopes, fears, enthusiasm, and hypocrisy, is a mighty agent in moulding human character, and it may therefore, with propriety, find a place in a work whose object it is to delineate that character. It is a principle of action more permanent and more universal than the affection which unites the sexes; and in the fictitious representations of human life, there can be no reason why the greater should be excluded by the less. On these impressions we have acted. We do not anticipate splendid success, but we are sure that we cannot be deprived of the consolation of having intended well. It will be an ample reward if we can believe that we have been able by our trivial labours to co-operate in any degree with the efforts of the good and great, “to give ardour to virtue, and confidence to truth.” Our anxiety is only for the great truths of our common religion, not for any of its subdivisions. The sketch which has been introduced of the society of Shakers was drawn from personal observation. It would have been withheld if we could have supposed that it would wound the feelings even of a single individual of that obscure sect. But against this there is a sufficient security. The representation is deemed just, and it is hoped would not be thought offensive; and, besides, there is little danger that these light volumes will ever find their way into a sanctuary from whose pale the frivolous amusements and profane literature of the “world's people” are carefully excluded. Whenever the course of our narrative has thrown opportunities to our way, we have attempted some sketches of the character and manners of the people of this country. We have done this with all faithfulness of purpose. If we have failed, we trust the failure will be ascribed, as it ought—to defect of capacity. We live in a country which is beyond parallel, free, happy, and abundant. As such we would describe it—but no Arcadia, for we have found none. We have indeed little sympathy with that narrow-minded patriotism which claims honours that are not yet merited. Our republicanism is founded on a broad and general principle, which is opposed to all coronations. We cannot, therefore, unite in hailing our country the “Queen of the earth:” and our religion is too catholic to permit us to claim for her the exclusive title of “Child of the skies:” but we have a deep and heartfelt pride—thank heaven a just pride— in the increasing intelligence, the improving virtue, and the rising greatness of our country. There is something which more excites the imagination and interests the affections in expanding energy and rapid improvement, than even in perfection itself, were that attainable on this earth; and therefore we will ask, what country there is, or has been, whose progress towards greatness has been in any degree correspondent with our own? Our change is so rapid that the future presses on our vision, and we enjoy it now. We heed not the sneer that our countrymen are “prophetic boasters.” The future lives in the present. What we are, we owe to our ancestors, and what our posterity will be, they will owe to us. New—York, June, 1824.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. B REDWOOD CHAPTER I. “A fine heroine, truly! A Patagonian monster without a show of breeding.” Anon. On the last day of June, in the year —, a small vessel, which traversed weekly the waters of Lake Champlain, was seen slowly entering one of the most beautiful bays of that most beautiful lake. A travelling carriage with handsome equipments, a coachman in livery and an outrider, were drawn up on the shore, awaiting the approach of the vessel. On the deck stood a group of travellers for whom the equipage was destined: a beautiful young woman, and her attendant, a female slave, were surveying it with pleased and equal eagerness, while the father of the young lady seemed quite absorbed in the contemplation of a scene which poetry and painting have marked for their own. Not a breeze stirred the waters; their mirror surface was quite unbroken, save where the little vessel traced its dimpled pathway. A cluster of islands lay in beautiful fraternity opposite the harbour, covered with a rich growth of wood, and looking young, and fresh, and bright, as if they had just sprung from the element on which they seemed to repose. The western shore presented every variety of form; wooded headlands jutting boldly into the lake, and richly cultivated grounds sloping gently to its margin. As the traveller's delighted eye explored still farther, it B 2 rested on the mountains that rise in four successive chains, one above the other, the last in the far distance dimly defining and bounding the horizon. A cloud at this moment veiled the face of the sun, and its rich beams streamed aslant upon the mountain tops, and poured showers of gold and purple light into the deep recesses of the valleys. Mr. Redwood, a true admirer of nature's lovely forms, turned his unsated gaze to the village they were approaching, which was indicated by a neat church spire that peered over the hill, on the height and declivities of which were planted several new and neat habitations. “Oh Caroline, my child,” exclaimed the father, “was there ever any thing more beautiful!” “Never, certainly, to my eye,” replied the daughter; “but I think a carriage far less handsome than ours would look beautiful, after those little ville calêches, and viler ponies, with which we made our entree into Montreal. Oh, papa,” continued the young lady, too intent on present pleasure and past mortification to notice the shade of disappointment that had chased away the animation of her father's face; “Oh, papa, I never shall forget our odious little Canadian driver, half Indian, half French, the rose tucked into his button-hole, the signal of one nation, and the wampum belt of the other; and then his mongrel dialect. Oh that `marse donc,' with which he excruciated his poney and us at the same moment, does it not yet ring in your ears?” “I cannot say that my recollections are quite as lively as yours, Caroline,” rejoined Mr. Redwood. “You are such an old traveller, papa, and besides you are always thinking of something else; but it is quite a different affair with me. My heavens! you had no imagination of my misery from the moment I entered the calêche at la Chine, until I was safely sheltered in my room at the hotel: you sat rolling your eyes around the green fields as if they were all drawing-rooms, and every dew-drop a diamond, while I would gladly have drowned myself in the St. Lawrence!” “Really, my dear,” replied the father, his tone bordering on contempt, “I did not suspect you of any such mad designs on your own sweet person—you seemed very quiet.” “Quiet, yes indeed, quiet enough; how could I help myself? but you must own, papa, that it was excessively mortifying to make our entrance into the city in such style. Grandmamma says that people of fortune should never lay aside the insignia of their rank.” “Your grandmother's jumble of fortune and rank have a strong savor of republican ignorance. I would advise you, Miss Redwood, not to adopt her wise axioms as rules for the conduct of your life. And you really allowed yourself to suffer mortification on account of entering the little city of Montreal, in the best mode the country provides for travellers—a place too, where not a creature knew you from any other member of the human family?” “Ah, there Sir, you are quite mistaken; for Captain Fenwick had written to all the officers of his corps our intention of going to Montreal, and he told me that he had described me so particularly to his friend Captain Fitzgerald, that he was sure he would know me at a single glance of his eye.” “Then we are indebted to Captain Fenwick for the honour of Fitzgerald's civilities? I fancied our acquaintance with him had been accidental.” The penetrating look with which Mr. Redwood finished his sentence, gave it an interrogative meaning, and his daughter feeling herself bound to reply, said, rather sullenly, “Our introduction was purely accidental: you saw it, Sir, and I thought at the time, seemed quite grateful that the timely aid of the Captain's arm saved me from being run over.” “I was and am grateful, my child, for the aid which the gallant Captain's arm afforded you; though it may be, that stoic as I am, I measured my gratitude rather by the danger than the alarm. The frightened animal, as well as I remember, turned into another street, instead of passing by the way we were going; but this is neither here nor there; I merely expressed an innocent surprise, that there should have been grounds for your acquaintance with Captain Fitzgerald which you never intimated to me.” “Lord, papa, it is so awkward to talk to you about such matters; I am sure I had no other objection to telling you that Fitzgerald knew all about us before he saw us.” “All about you, Miss Redwood; for I am quite a cypher in the eyes of such men as the Captain, having no other value than what results from being your adjunct. Fitzgerald was then apprised that you are a belle, and will be an heiress?” “Probably. And if I do possess the advantage of those distinctions, I am sure I ought to be much indbeted to Captain Fenwick for making them known, that I may enjoy them abroad as well as at home.” Mr. Redwood thought the distinctions which procured for his daughter a host of such admirers as Fitzgerald of very doubtful advantage, and would perhaps have said so, but the vessel at this moment touched the wharf, and the bustle of disembarking put an end to the conversation. The travellers having arranged themselves in the carriage, Mr. Redwood ordered the coachman to drive to the village tavern, where he said it was his intention to pass the night. A short drive carried them to the door of the village inn. The landlord was sitting on a bench before the B 3 door, alternately reading a newspaper, and haranguing half-a-dozen loiterers on the great political topics that then agitated the country: his own patriotic politics were sufficiently indicated by the bearings of his sign-board; on one side of which was rudely sketched the surrender of Burgoyne, and on the other, an American eagle with his talons triumphantly planted on a British lion. It cannot be pretended that the skill of the artist had been adequate to revealing his design to the observation of the passing traveller; or rather the design of “Major Jonathan Doolittle,” whose name stood in bold relief on one side, under the shadow of the spread wing of the eagle; and on the other under the delineation of the victory, which, according to the major's own opinion, he had been a distinguished instrument in achieving. But any deficiency in the skill of the artist was abundantly supplied by the valuable comment of the major, whose memory or imagination filled up the imperfect outline with every particular of the glorious victory. The carriage drew up to the door of the valiant publican, and in answer to Mr. Redwood's inquiry for the landlord, the major replied without doffing his hat or changing his attitude, “I am he, Sir, in the room of a better.” Mr. Redwood then inquired, if he could obtain accommodation for the night. The major replied exchanging with his compatriots a knowing wink, “that he rather guessed not: he did not lay out to entertain people from the old countries; his women folks thought they took too much waiting on.” Caroline whispered an entreaty to her father, to order the coachman to drive on; but Mr. Redwood, without heeding her, said, “you mistake us, friend, we are your own country people, just returning from a visit to the British provinces, and as we have our own servants, and shall not need much waiting on, you will not perhaps object to receiving us.” The major's reluctance was somewhat abated by this information, and would probably have been quite overcome, but for his desire of keeping up his consequence in the eyes of the by-standers, by showing off his inherent dislike of an unquestionable gentleman. He said, they were calculating to have a training the next day, and the women folks had just put the house to rights, and he rather guessed, they would not choose to have it disturbed, but it was according as they could agree; “and if,” he added, for the first time rising and advancing towards Mr. Redwood, “if the gentleman could make it an object to them to take so much trouble, he would go in and inquire.” This last interested stipulation of the major filled up the measure of Mr. Redwood's disgust; and turning abruptly from him to a good-natured looking man, who, at that moment riding past them on horseback, had checked the career of his horse to gaze at the travellers, he inquired the distance to the next village. “That,” replied the man, “is according to which road you take.” “Is there any choice between the roads?” “It's rather my belief there is; anyhow, there is many opinions held about them. Squire Upton said, it was shortest by his house, if you cut off the bend by deacon Garson's; and General Martin maintained, it was shortest round the long quarter, so they got out the surveyor and chained it.” “And which road,” interrupted Mr. Redwood, “proved the shortest?” “Oh there was no proof about it; the road is a bone of contention yet. The surveyor was called off to hold a Justice's court before he had finished the squire's road, and—” “Which do you believe the shortest?” exclaimed Mr. Redwood, impatiently cutting short the history of the important controversy. “Oh, I,” replied the man, laughing, “and every body else but the squire, calculate it to be the shortest way round the long quarter, and the prospects are altogether preferable that way, and that is something of an object, as you seem to be strangers in these parts.” “Oh Lord,” exclaimed Caroline, “it will soon be too dark for any prospect but that of breaking all our necks!” “Do you think,” pursued Mr. Redwood, “that we shall be able to arrive before dark?” “That's according as your horses are.” “The horses are good and fleet.” “Well then, Sir, it will depend something on the driver; but if you will take my advice, you will stop by the way. It is not far from night; there is a pretty pokerish cloud rising; it is a stretchy road to Eaton, and it will be something risky for you to try to get there by daylight. But, Sir, if you find yourself crowded for time, and will stop at my house, we will do our best to make you comfortable for the night. If you will put up with things being in a plain farmer-like way, you shall be kindly welcome.” Mr. Redwood thanked the good man heartily for the proffer of his hospitality, but declined it, saying, he doubted not they should be able to reach the next village before the storm. He then directed his coachman to drive on rapidly; and exchanging a farewell nod with his informant, who rode on briskly before him, he sunk back into his seat, and relapsed into silence and abstraction. Meanwhile, Caroline sat listening in trepidation to the hoarse, though yet distant threatenings of the thunder, and watching with a restless eye the fearful clouds that rolled darkly, volume over volume, in their ascent to mid heaven. “For gracious sake put your head out of the coach, Lilly,” said she to her servant, “and look if there is any sign of the village.” Lilly could just discern the spire of a church that stood on a distant hill. “On a hill of course,” replied Caroline; “one would think these Yankees had contrived their churches for telegraphs. I am delighted at any rate, that there is a landmark in sight. For heaven's sake, papa,” she added, impetuously turning to her father, “do rouse yourself, and look at those clouds.” “I have been looking, my child, for the last half hour, watching the fading away of the bright tints from the edges of that beautiful mass of clouds, and thinking them a fit emblem of human life. Thus we gaze upon the brilliant vapour, and are dazzled with its changeful hues, till the storm bursts in fury on our heads. Hark, Caroline, how the wind sighs through the branches of the trees: does it not seem as if nature thus expressed her dread of the violence that is about to be done to her beautiful face?” “Oh, what does master mean,” inquired Lilly; “does he think our faces will be struck with the lightning?” “Heaven only knows what your master means. Do, papa, tell Ralph to drive faster, the darkness is horrible.” Mr. Redwood soon felt that his daughter's terrors were not groundless. The clouds had gathered a portentous blackness, strong gales of wind were rushing over the lake, the rain already poured in torrents, and there were only such intervals between the lightning as served to contrast the vivid flashes with the thick darkness; the thunder burst in loud explosions over their heads, and its fearful peals were prolonged and reverberated by the surrounding hills. The horses became restive, and the coachman called to his master for permission to stop at the next habitation. This was readily granted, and the coachman reined his horses into a road that led off the highway, over a little knoll to a farm house which stood on a small eminence at the right. Some rocks, a few feet in height, served as an embankment to the read on the left. The coachman cracked his whip, and the horses were pressing on at their utmost speed, when a thunder-bolt struck an enormous dead tree a little in advance of them, fired its driest branches, descended the trunk of the tree, and tearing to splinters the parts it touched, laid the roots bare, and passed off across the road. The horses terrified by the excessive vividness of the lightning, or the flaming tree, or perhaps both, sprang to the left, and before the coachman, scarcely less terrified than they, had made an effort to control their movements, they had dashed over the rocks, and forced the carriage after them. The horses sprang through a clump of young walnuts that grew at the base of the rocks. Most happily the carriage was too wide for the passage, and the axles of the wheels were caught by the trees: the sudden check given to the velocity of the motion of the carriage broke the traces, and the released horses bounded away, leaving it and its inmates in perfect safety. The moment Mr. Redwood perceived the horses would inevitably descend the rocks, he had instinctively opened the carriage door and sprung out: he fell against the trunk of a tree, and when he attempted to rise to move to his daughter's relief, he felt himself disabled, and sunk back insensible. Fortunately the coachman, quite unharmed, flew to the aid of the mistress and maid, who were both shrieking in the carriage. “Oh, stop the horses, stop the horses!” cried Caroline. “The horses, Miss Caroline, are gone.” “Gone; but oh, Raphy, won't they come back again?” Upon Ralph's repeated assurances that there was not the slightest danger of, or from such a circumstance, Caroline alighted, and found to her surprise, life and limb unscathed. When she had quite satisfactorily ascertained this fact, she turned to look for her father, but when she saw him stretched on the grass the image of death, she shrunk back appalled. At this moment she heard some persons approaching to their assistance; they were from the neighbouring farm-house, and had been alarmed by her shrieks which they had heard even amid the “wild war of earth and heaven.” “Make the best of your way, miss, to the house,” said one of the men kindly, “we will bring the gentleman in our arms.” Caroline followed the direction, and was met at the door by several females, who clustered about her with expressions of pity, and offers of assistance. She moved past them all, and throwing herself into a chair, vented her feelings in loud hysterical sobbings; while Lilly set up a most doleful cry of “Oh, what will become of us, master is killed, and the horses are gone!” The mistress of the house with a voice of authority commander her to be still; and at this moment the men entered, bearing in Mr. Redwood, pale as death, but sensible and calm. “Thank God you are not hurt, my child,” he said, on seeing Caroline, “and I am better.” The door of a spare room being now thrown open, the bed uncovered, the pillows shaken up, the mistress of the house pointed to the men to deposit their burthen there. Caroline and her servant followed Mr. Redwood; but so much were they both terrified by his paleness, and the distortion of his face from the extreme pain he endured, that they were incapable of offering him any assistance. Not so the good matron and her young hand-maidens. It seemed to be their vocation to act; and so efficient were they in their prompt ministration of camphor and cordials, that he was soon in a state fully to understand his condition and wants. He said to his daughter that it would be necessary for him to remain where he was for the present, to summon a physician immediately, to ascertain the injury he had sustained, and to set his arm if the bones were, as he apprehended, displaced; against this the daughter warmly remonstrated. His host, having overheard a part of the debate, which was conducted in an under tone, said he would call Debby. “Debby,” he said, “was as skilful as the run of doctors; she was a nat'ral bone setter; at any rate, if the gentleman was not willing to trust himself in her hands, she could tell if there were any broken bones.” Debby was summoned, and soon made her appearance, muttering something about the boys, boy fashion, having left out the old mare, and she guessed she felt as much pain with her broken leg, as your quality. She, however, seemed a little softened at the sight of Mr. Redwood, who was evidently suffering acute pain, and what probably interested Debby more, bearing it manfully. “Not,” she continued, “that I would put a beast's life against a man's; but she is a good creature, and a sarviceable, and it is a shame for the boys to neglect her because she grows a little old and unsightly.” The boys, as she denominated two full grown young men, who stood at the foot of the bed, exchanged smiles, as if they were too much inured to this privileged railer to heed her reproaches. Mr. Redwood shrunk from her touch as she approached him; but without noticing his alarm, she thrust her hand into an enormous pocket, which hung on one side of her gaunt person, and extricating from its miscellaneous contents a large pair of scissors, (which one would have thought stood as little chance of being found as a needle in a hay-mow,) she cut open the sleeve of the coat with more care and adroitness than could have been expected from such an operator, and then unceremoniously tearing down the shirt sleeve, she proceeded to the examination of the arm, which she pronounced a bad business. The shoulder she said was out of joint, and a breakage into the bargain: “and do you, James,” said she, turning to one of the young men, “mount Rover, and go for Doctor Bristol, and tell him to come as fast as horse-flesh can bring him, for it an't all nature can set this arm after to-night. And James, child,” she added, “be careful when you take Rover out of the stable, not to hit the old mare; for beasts have feelings too.” There had been such promptness in Miss Debby's proceedings, and the family was obviously so much in the habit of obeying her orders, that Mr. Redwood had not as yet been able to interpose a question; but as James turned to execute Debby's order, he said, “stop, young man; before you go I should like to know who this Dr. Bristol is, and to ascertain his ability to perform a delicate operation; and I must know from you, my friend,” he continued, turning to the master of the house, (whom he had just recognised to be the same person who had so kindly invited him to accept a shelter beneath his roof,) “whether you can accommodate my daughter and myself, while we may be detained by this unlucky accident?” Mr. and Mrs. Lenox (the farmer and his wife,) were eagerly beginning to proffer their hospitality, with the courtesy of genuine kindness, when Debby interrupted them, with saying, “go along, James, is this no time to stand upon compliments, go like the wind, a miss is as good as a mile.” James obeyed; and Mr. Lenox said, VOL. I. C I believe you may trust Dr. Bristol, Sir; he doctors all the country round, and in all curable cases, under Providence, he cures. He studied under Rush, and has but few equals in these parts.” “No, no,” said Debby, “nor in any other parts: he is a real likely man, and they a'n't much thicker any where than swallows in January.” “But,” interposed Mr. Lenox, “as the gentleman is a stranger among us, it is natural, and very right that he should be mistrustful.” “Oh, quite right,” replied Debby, “and rational; and I like him all the better for it; none but your parfect fools believe in any thing and every body. But it is,” she continued, with the goût of an amateur in the matter, “it is a real pleasure to see Dr. Bristol set bones; it is beautiful. There was Tom Russel, fool and mad-cap that he was, and bating his being a human creature, better dead than alive, that fell off from the steeple of our meeting-house; there was scarce a whole bone left in his body; and when the doctor first overhauled him, he looked dumb-foundered, for he is tender-hearted for all being a doctor I spirited him up, and he went to work, and a quicker, neater piece of work, never has been done since the days of miracles: the bones went snap, crack, like the guns of our militia boys; not quite so loud may-be, but full as reg'lar.” “God Grant,” exclaimed Mr. Redwood, (who had been writhing under Debby's story,) “that your doctor may not have lost his gifts, nor his skill.” “No,” replied Debby, “a wise man a'n't apt to lose either.” Mr. Redwood felt a natural apprehension, lest he should not be able to obtain the aid of this physician, whose skill seemed to have inspired such confidence, and he inquired of Mr. Lenox, if he thought it probable the messenger would find him at home. “Almost certain,” replied C 2 Mr. Lenox, “he was here yesterday to pay his last visit to a young man who has been a long time sick, poor fellow: he died last evening.” “A consolatory proof of your doctor's skill,” murmured Mr. Redwood. Half-a-dozen mouths were opened at once to explain the doctor's failure. Deborah's shrill tones prevailed over every other voice; “our days are all numbered, man,” she said, “and to all there comes a sickness that neither doctors nor doctor's-trade can cure; and besides, as to in'ard diseases, there's none but your pretensioners that profess to understand them at all times.” “And poor Edward,” interposed Mr. Lenox, “died, I believe, of that which you may well call an inward disease, for which there is no help in this world, a broken heart.” “As much that as any thing,” said Debby; “at least that might be called the 'casion of it all; and it is far easier,” she continued, looking at Mr. Redwood, “mending broken bones than broken hearts.” “And far easier breaking bones than hearts,” replied Mr. Redwood. “That,” said the indefatigable Deborah, “depends something upon what the heart is made of. Some hearts are tough as a bull's hide; you might as well break a rock with sun-beams as break them with such troubles as snapped the chord of poor Eddy, a weakly narvous feeling creature.” Mr. Redwood, was suffering too severely to indulge any curiosity in relation to Eddy. All parties became silent, and remained so until the arrival of the physician, save the occasional interruption of a groan from the stranger, or an expression of sympathy from some one of the group that surrounded his bed. We may profitably fill this interval with a description of the various persons that the occasion had assembled. And first, as most conspicuous, the stranger, mutilated as he was, appeared a finely formed and graceful man, with a certain air of gentility and high-breeding, which even an unpractised eye may detect in the most unfavourable circumstances. He was rather above the ordinary height, and extremely thin. His high forehead, from which the hair had receded; the hair itself, “Jet black save where some touch of gray Had ta'en the youthful hue away;” and the deep furrow in his cheeks, indicated that sorrow in some of its Proteus shapes, had accelerated the work of time; that the fruit which youth had promised, had been blasted—not ripened. His face was a history; but there were few that possessed the key by which the settled gloom of his pallid brow, and the melancholy of his fine hazle eye might have been interpreted. The figure of Deborah supporting the elegant traveller, looked like the rough-hewn stone beside the exquisitely polished statue on which the sculptor has expended all his art. Miss Debby's person, mind, and history, were altogether singular. Her height was rather above the grenadier standard, as she exceeded by one inch six feet; her stature and her weatherbeaten skin would have led one to suspect that her feminine dress was a vain attempt at disguise, had not her voice, which possessed the shrillness which is the peculiar attribute of a woman's, testified to Miss Debby's right to make pretensions which at the first glance seemed monstrous; her quick grey eye, shaded by huge, bushy eye-brows, indicated sagacity and thought; time, or accident, had made such ravages on her teeth, that but a very few remained, and they stood like hardy veterans who have by dint of superior strength survived their contemporaries. As Debby would not voluntarily encumber herself with any toilette duties that could in decency be dispensed with, she had never put any covering on her hair, which time had now considerably grisled; but she wore it confined in one long braid, and so closely bound with a black ribbon, that it did not require, in her judgment, more than a weekly adjustment. The only relict of worldly or womanly vanity which Debby displayed, was a string of gold beads, which according to a tradition that had been carefully transmitted to the younger members of the family, had been given to their Aunt Debby some thirty years before by a veteran soldier, who, at the close of our revolutionary war, was captivated by the martial air of this then young Amazon. But Debby was so imbued with the independent spirit of the times, that she would not then consent to the surrender of any of her rights: and there was no tradition in the family that her maidenly pride had suffered a second solicitation. The careful preservation of the beads, and a certain kindliness and protecting air towards all mankind, indicated ever after a grateful recollection of her lover. On the whole, there was in Deborah's face, rough and ungainly as it was, an expression of benevolence that humanized its hard features, and affected one like the sun-beams on a frosty November day. She was an elder sister of Mr. Lenox; had always resided with his family; and was treated with deference by all its amiable members. Mr. Lenox, as master of the family, was entitled to precedence in our description; but in this instance, as in many others, a prominent character has controlled the arrangement of accidental circumstances. He belonged to the mass of New-England farmers, was industrious and frugal, sober and temperate, and enjoyed the reward of those staple C 3 virtues, good health and a competency. He was rather distinguished for the passive than the active virtues, patient and contented; he either enjoyed with tranquillity, or resigned without repining. His wife (we believe not a singular case in matrimonial history,) was his superior: intelligent, well-informed, enterprising, and efficient, she was accounted by all her neighbours an ambitious woman. The lofty may smile with contempt, that the equivocal virtue, which is appropriated to the Cæsars and the Napoleons, should be so much as mentioned in the low vales of humble life. But the reasonable will not dispute that Mrs. Lenox made ambition virtue, when they learn that all her aspirations after distinction were limited to the appropriate duties of her station. Her husband and sons wore the finest cloth that was manufactured in the county of —. Mrs. Lenox's table was covered with the handsomest and the whitest diaper. Her butter and cheese commanded the highest price in the market. Besides these home-bread virtues, she possessed the almost universal passion of her country for intellectual pleasures. She read with avidity herself, and eagerly seized every opportunity for the improvement of her children. She had married very young, and was still in the prime of life. The elder members of her family were already educated and established in the world; and she had the prospect of enjoying what Franklin reckons among the benefits of our early marriages, “an afternoon and evening of cheerful leisure.” Her eldest son, with very little aid from his parents, had, by his own virtuous exertions, obtained a collegiate and theological education, and was established a popular clergyman in one of the southern cities. Her second son had emigrated to Ohio, and had already transmitted to his parents a drawing and description of a prosperous little town, where, five years before, his axe had first announced man's right to dominion over the forest. Two sons remained at home to labour on the paternal farm; and four girls, from ten to eighteen, diligent, good-humoured, and intelligent, completed the circle of the domestic felicities of this happy family. Both Mr. and Mrs. Lenox had the wise and dutiful habit, which, in almost any condition, might generate contentment, of looking at their own possessions, to awaken their gratitude, rather than by comparing the superior advantages of others with their meaner possessions, to dash their own cup with the venom of discontent and envy, a few drops of which will poison the sweetest draught ever prepared by a paternal Providence, On the kindness of this family Mr. Redwood and his daughter were cast for the present; and proud and powerful in the possession of rank and fortune, Miss Redwood was obliged to learn the humiliating truth, that no human creature can command independence. Mr. Redwood had been all his life a traveller, and was a man of the world. He comprehended at once the embarrassments of his situation, and gracefully accommodated himself to the inconveniences of it, and in such a way, as to conciliate the favour of the goodhearted people about him. How far his daughter imitated his wise example, the following pages will show.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER II. “A country doctor,” said Touchwood sneeringly; “you will never be able to make any thing of him.” The Cynic. Before the return of James Lenox with the physician, Mr. Redwood had made an arrangement with Mr. Lenox, who consented to consider the strangers as boarders while Mr. Redwood's accident should detain him at the place we shall call Eton. Some little bustle in the entry announced the arrival of the physician, and he entered the apartment followed by Caroline, who with more alarm than she had testified before, advanced hastily to her father, and said in a tone which, though a little depressed, was still overheard by all the by-standers—“My dear father, you surely will not suffer yourself to be murdered by a country doctor; pray, pray, remember poor Rose.” “Your grand mother' slap-dog? do not be a simpleton, Caroline.” “I do not see,” replied Caroline, still in a tone of eager expostulation, “how Rose, being a dog, alters the case. I am sure grandmamma thought as much of her as of any friend she had in the world. May not,” she added, turning to the physician, “may not my father wait till a surgeon can be obtained from Boston or New York?” “Undoubtedly he may,” replied the doctor, smiling. “And without danger?” inquired Mr. Redwood, who seemed to have become infected with his daughter's apprehensions. “Possibly without danger,” replied the physician, “though I should apprehend not without great additional suffering.” “Better to suffer than to die,” urged Caroline. “I trust your father is not reduced to that alternative,” replied the physician. “Such accidents are inconvenient, but seldom fatal. Shall I, Sir,” he added, turning to Mr. Redwood, “proceed to the examination of your arm?” The modest demeanour and manly promptness of the doctor inspired his patient with confidence; and ashamed of having for a moment yielded to the weakness of his daughter, he said, “proceed, Sir, certainly. Forgive my daughter's scruples—she is alarmed and inexperienced.” “She is a dumb fool,” muttered Debby; and laying her arm on Caroline's, with a force to compel obedience, she pushed her out of the room, and then with an absolute command, dispersing all but those whose assistance was required, she prepared to obey the orders of docter Bristol, to whom she evidently deferred as to a master operator. The physician in his turn treated her as a confidential agent; and so quietly, skilfully, and expeditiously did he perform the operation, that he fully substantiated in the judgment of his grateful patient, all the praise that had been lavished on him. Mr. Redwood bore the operation with stoical firmness, but after it was over his strength seemed much exhausted. His physician ordered that he should be kept perfectly quiet, and that no one should have access to the room but those whose services were necessary. He inquired of Mr. Redwood if he preferred that his daughter should stay with him. Mr. Redwood sighing deeply, replied, that his daughter was too much unaccustomed to scenes of this kind to be of any use to him; and the physician proceeded to make arrangements with Mrs. Lenox and Deborah. The result of their deliberations was, that Deborah should keep this night's vigil at the bed of the sick man. These important arrangements being made, doctor Bristol undertook to inform Miss Redwood of her father's amended condition. She received the intelligence with less animation than might have been reasonably anticipated from the apprehensions she had expressed. “She was glad,” she said, “it was all over, for she was tired to death and wished to go to her room.” “Yes,” said her officious domestic, “you are tired, Miss Cary, you look very sick, as pale as a ghost.” “Oh Lilly,” exclaimed Caroline, “that is impossible, for I never lose my colour, you know;” and she ran briskly to a looking-glass, which, shrouded in gauze, and bedecked with festoons of ground-pine adorned Mrs. Lenox's neat parlour. The mirror was imperfect, and it sent back as distorted a resemblance of the disappointed beauty, as if spleen and envy had reflected the image. “Oh Lord! Lord!” she exclaimed, “it would be the death of me to see myself again in that odious glass.” “I hope not,” said doctor Bristol. “We have specifics for such diseases in this retirement, where there are few to admire, and none to flatter.” “Are all your specifics, caustics, doctor?” “Oh, no!” replied the doctor, smiling very pleasantly, (for it cannot be denied that his instinctive indignation at Miss Redwood's insensibility was softened by her matchless beauty;) “no, we prescribe caustics for inveterate diseases only: for the young and susceptible we have gentler remedies.” “And your cure for vanity is—” “Abstinence—or, a low diet often subdues the violence of the symptoms— the disease is of the chronic order, seldom cured. But do not imagine that I have the presumption to prescribe for you, Miss Redwood, ignorant as I am even of the existence of the malady.” “Your prescription, Sir, would at any rate be quite superfluous,” replied Caroline, arranging while she spoke, with evident satisfaction, her dark glossy curls before the mirror of her dressing-case, which Lilly (with the true instinct of a lady's maid,) had placed before her mistress; “vanity will die of starvation in this solitude.” “Oh my dear young lady, you are ignorant of the disease,” rejoined the doctor; “there is no element in which it cannot live, and thrive, and find food convenient for it. I am not much skilled in the history of classic gentry; but if I remember right, it was not the flatteries of a court or a multitude that cost poor Narcissus his life, but a rustic truth-telling woodland stream: depend on it, Miss Redwood, the danger is within; and `inward diseases,' as my friend Debby calls them, are apt to baffle the most skilful.” “That being so, Sir,” retorted Miss Redwood, “it may be well to reserve your skill for obvious diseases and real dangers.” She then proceeded to inquire with considerable interest, into the particulars of her father's injury; and concluded by asking how long they should be detained at Eton. “It is impossible to say,” replied the doctor; “five or six weeks, perhaps longer. Your father's recovery must depend somewhat on his previous health and stock of spirits.” “Oh, then it is a desperate case, for he has been on the verge of consumption for these two years; and as to his spirits, heaven only knows when he had any. He has been as dull as death ever since I remember him.” “Very unfavourable,” replied the doctor, shaking his head; “but a parent's melancholy must be obstinate indeed to resist the cheering efforts of a child; and I trust, Miss Redwood, your resolution and patience will be equal to the present demand on them.” “It is a demand I cannot answer, Sir. I might as well call spirits from the vasty deep, as summon mine at pleasure. Grandmamma always said cheerfulness was a virtue that belonged to common people—quite necessary for them. I am never melancholy, however. Melancholy only suits the old and unfortunate; and if I must remain here, I will try not to hang myself.” “A virtuous resolution, truly.” “Doctor,” exclaimed Caroline, after a few moments pause, “is there nothing going on here; nothing to keep one alive?” “Yes,” replied the doctor, drily, “from this very house there is to be a funeral to-morrow.” “Quite a diverting circumstance,” rejoined Caroline. “Pray, Sir, who is it that is to be buried? No one of any consequence of course.” “Goodness is the only consequence that we acknowledge,” replied the doctor, gravely; “and our young friend's escutcheon has no blot upon it.” Caroline seemed mortified, and did not pursue her inquiries, and the physician took his leave after having repeated his orders that the invalid should be kept as quiet as possible till his return in the morning. Miss Redwood was shown into a small but very neat apartment, in which were two beds; one of them had just been arranged for her accommodation. “This bed is for me, is it?” she enquired turning to a little girl who was her conductor, and at the same moment negligently throwing down her hat on a neatly spread quilt, as white as snow. `,Yes, miss, that is yours,” replied the child. “And the other is my servant's?” “Oh no, miss, that is Ellen's!” “Well, you little thing, what is your name?” “Lucy,” replied the child, dropping a courtesy. “Well, Lucy, ask your mother to order a bed to be made for my servant here.” “I can ask her,” replied the child; “but,” she added in a lower tone as she was leaving the room, “I guess she won't find it convenient to put that black girl into Ellen's room.” Lucy, however, notwithstanding her prediction, returned in a few moments to say that Miss Redwood's request was granted; “and you may thank Ellen for it,” she added, “for mother would not hear to it till Ellen begged her.” “Well, well, child, you may go now— it is all very well. I shall take care to compensate your mother, and this Ellen too, for any favours they may grant me. Lilly,” she added, turning to her servant “undress me, and make over that bed, it is not likely these people know how to make a bed. Pin down the undersheet all around as grandmamma has hers; I feel fidgetty to-night, and a wrinkle would disturb me—heigho! how long is it since we left Montreal, Lilly?” “Two days, Miss Cary.” “Two days! what an age it seems: two days since I parted from the divine Fitzgerald, and it will be twice that number of weeks before I see another civilized being. That old jade that told my fortune, coming down the lake, was not so much out when she said I should meet with losses and crosses; but who could have dreamed of such a cross as this? And then to think that the Crayton's will get to Boston before us; and Maria will contrive to show off her French dresses first. Oh, it is too provoking! For heaven's sake, Lilly, stow away my VOL. I. D trunk out of my sight, it will make me wretched to see those beautiful dresses, of Le Moine's all lying idle, getting yellow, and old-fashioned.” Thus Miss Redwood continued to run on, half to her servant and half to herself, till she lost in sleep the consciousness of her disappointments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III. “Fleecy locks and black complexion Cannot forfeit nature's claim; Skins may differ, but affection Dwells in white and black the same.” Cowper. Henry Redwood was a native of Virginia, that State of the Union where the patrician rank has escaped in the greatest degree, the levelling principle of republicanism. His father was a rich planter: adhering pertinaciously to the custom of his predecessors, he determined that his eldest son should inherit his large landed property. To Henry he gave a good education, and designed that he should resort to the usual expedient of unportioned gentility, compensating D 2 by his marriage for the defects of his inheritance. He was early destined to be the husband of Maria Manning, the only daughter of Mr. Redwood's sister, a rich widow who resided in Charleston, South-Carolina. Henry Redwood had originally a highly gifted mind, and strong affections; under happy influences he might have become the benefactor of his country, its ornament and blessing; or he might in domestic life have illustrated the virtues that are appropriate to its quiet paths. His father trained his eldest son in his own habits, which were those of an English country squire. Henry was left to follow the bent of his own inclinations, and possessing a less robust constitution than his brother, and a contemplative turn of mind, he preferred sedentary to active pursuits. He early manifested a decided taste for literature; he felt the beauty, and confessed the power of the moral sublime; he loved the virtues that illustrate the pages of the moralist, and he sympathized with the examples of heroism which the poet and the historian have rescued from the ashes of past ages. But unhappily he saw few resemblances in life to these fair portraits. His father's character was of the coarsest texture; his life when not devoted to the gaming table, the excitements of the race-ground, or the stimulating pleasures of the chase, was wasted in the most perfect indolence at home: his mother had been a beauty, and possessed many of the gentle qualities of her sex, but, unresisting and timid in her nature, she had fallen into such habits of unqualified submission to her husband, that she had no longer courage to assert the rights of virtue, or power to impress them on her children. Young Redwood had one friend, the son of a neighbouring planter, whom he called his good genius, and his elevated character and rare purity entitled him to this distinction. The influence of his virtues and affection might, perhaps, have preserved Henry from the errors of his after life, but their opportunities of intercourse were rare and brief, in consequence of a political animosity between their parents; and before Henry had received impressions deep enough to mature into principle the strong inspirations of feeling, he was sent to college; there, by one of those unlucky chances that sometimes give a colour to the destiny of life, he was led, first to an acquaintance, and subsequently to an intimacy, with an unprincipled man, by the name of Alsop. This man possessed plausible talents and insinuating manners; but his mind had been contaminated by the infidelity fashionable at that period, and his vanity was stimulated by the hope of adding to his little band of converts a young man of Redwood's acknowledged genius. The unfeeling and audacious wit of Voltaire, the subtle arguments of Hume, and all that reckless and busy infidelity has imagined and invented, were arrayed by this skilful champion against the accidental faith of Henry Redwood: for that faith may surely be called accidental which knows no reason for its existence, but is the result of being born in a christian community, and of an occasional attendance at church. The triumph was an easy one. Redwood's vision, like that of other unbelievers, was dazzled by the ignus fatuus that his own vanity had kindled; and like them, he flattered himself, that he was making great discoveries, because he had turned from the road which was travelled by the vulgar throng. In the free and even licentious speculation of the closet, young Redwood, was not surpassed by any of his new intimates; but he had a purity and refinement of taste, which, though it would not have opposed an effectual barrier to strong temptation, deterred him from associating himself with them in their gross and profligate pleasures. He was sometimes disgusted, but never shocked by their profligacy. He maintained that whatever a man called good was good to him; and that, released from the thraldom of fearing a visionary future, he was at liberty to disengage himself from the galling fetters which virtue and religion impose, and to expatiate without apprehension or compunction in a religion of perfect liberty. A little reflection, and a very short experience taught him, that these principles would dissolve society, and then like some other philosophers, he adopted expediency for his rule of right. He found it to be impossible so suddenly to emancipate men from the slavery of prejudice; “some hundred years must pass away before the downfall of the prevailing systems of superstition.” The enlightened must submit, while the ignorant are the majority; and a man's conduct must be graduated by the standard of the community in which he lived. Opinion was the rule, and ignorance the presiding deity, in this new creed. Still Henry Redwood's reason was not quite obscured, nor his heart quite depraved. He often turned from the heartless pages of infidelity to the inspiration of virtue, and found that while the first controlled his judgment, the latter could alone sway his affections. A virtuous action would send an involuntary glow to his cheek, and make him wish he had never doubted the reality of the principle that produced it. Redwood was ambitious; and after having won the first literary honours of his college, he returned to his family elated with his success, and proud of his superiority. He again met the friend of his youth Edmund Westall, who, during D 3 their separation had become a married man; and in whose family Redwood found irresistible attractions. Westall was a few years older than Redwood; and there was an authority in his example that could not well be evaded, and a persuasion in his goodness that touched Redwood's heart. He felt it like an excrcism that conjured out of him every evil spirit. But the state of his own mind will be best shown by a letter which he wrote at this time to his infidel friend. “Some months have elapsed, dear Alsop, since we parted, and parted with a truly juvenile promise to keep up an unremitting epistolary intercourse. And this I believe is the first essay made by either of us; a fair illustration of the common proportion which performance bears to such promises. You, no doubt, have been roving from pleasure to pleasure, with an untiring impulse, and your appetite, like the horse-leech, has still cried, `give, give.' If one of your vagrant thoughts has strayed after me, you have doubtless fancied me immured in my study, pursuing my free inquiries, abandoning the fallen systems of vulgar invention, and soaring far over the misty atmosphere of imposture and credulity. Or, perhaps, you deem that I have adopted your sapient advice, have returned to my home a dutiful child, gracefully worn the chains of filial obedience, made my best bow to papa, and with a, `just as you please, Sir,' fallen, secundum artem, desperately in love with my beautiful, and beautifully rich cousin; have rather taken than asked her willing hand, and thus opened for myself the path of ambition, or the golden gates that lead to the regions of pleasure, and which none but fortune's hand can open, But, alas! the most reasonable hopes are disappointed by our fantastic destiny. We are the sport of chance; and as we confess no other deity, you are bound not to deride any of the whimsical dilemmas into which his votaries are led. Alsop, you have often commended the boldness of my mind, while you laughed at a certain involuntary homage I paid to the beautiful pictures of goodness, which some dreaming enthusiasts have presented to us, or to the moral beauty which among all the varieties of accidental combination, is sometimes exhibited in real life. “Have I prepared you to hear the confession that I am at this present moment the blind and willing dupe of goodness, (I mean what the moralists call goodness,) embodied in a form that might soften a stoic, convert an infidel, or perform any other miracle. “You have heard me make honourable mention of my friend Westall. He is by some years my elder, three or four at least. I think I never related the circumstances of our introduction to each other; I am quite certain I did not, for you would have laughed at them; they may now serve to elucidate to you my friend's character, and to account for our early and reciprocal interest. “My father had among his servants a native African; one of those men whom nature has endowed with a giant frame, and correspondent qualities of mind. At the time my father purchased him, he was separated from his wife and two children, girls; the only boy my father purchased with him, whether because he thought the presence of the child would help to keep the father in heart, or from a transient feeling of compassion for the poor wretch, I know not. The wife had suffered deplorably from the voyage, and was knocked down with her two girls to a Georgian for a trifle. You do not know my father: suffice it to say, that selfishness and habit have made him quite insensible to the sufferings of these poor devils, whom he classes with other brutes born for our service. But there was something extraordinary in the strong affections and unconquerable temper of this man. His wife and little ones were torn from his strong grasp, and when resistance was hopeless, and he turned from them, the large muscles of his neck swelled almost to bursting, and he set up a desperate howl, that made every heart quake or melt. Some one of the throng around him, put his boy into his arms: the sight of him changed the current of his feelings; he soon became silent, and, a few moments after, his tears fell thick and heavy on the child. My father brought him home. He performed his appointed tasks well, but he was retired and sulky, and the smallest services that were imposed on his child seemed to exasperate his spirit. It was not many months after he came into our possession, that our overseer, a cruel worthless dog, beat the child who had unwarily offended him, unmercifully. The father interposed and rescued the child at the expense of some cutting lashes on his own back, which he seemed to regard no more than the idle wind. The very night after, the child disappeared, and it was believed the unhappy father had put an end to the boy's life. The fact was never ascertained, though no one doubted it; for as you will readily believe my father was not very zealous to establish a truth which would have deprived him of one of his most valuable slaves. These circumstances transpired before I was old enough to remember them; but when I first heard the report of them among our domestic annals, I felt an involuntary respect for this man, who with a spirit more noble than Cato's, cut the cord that bound his son to captivity, and manfully continued to endure the galling of his own chains. Was not this a glorious illustration of the truth of our old friend Seneca's remark, that `sometimes to live is magnanimity?' “Time passed on, but Africk (for that was the name my father had given him,) remained unaltered. I think I see him now, going to his daily task, always apart from the herd, and quite alone; his firm and slow step, the curling of his lip, which would have better become a monarch than a slave, and his fixed downcast eye. “His mind, which like adamant had resisted the influence of time, was at last subdued by fanaticism, which you know, like some chemical powers, will dissolve substances that no chemical force can impress. My father (a little alarmed himself, as I suspect, by an eloquent harangue,) permitted a zealous Methodist or Moravian, I am not certain which, but a member of one of these tribes of amiable madmen, to address his people. A great sensation was produced, and among the rest, Africk eagerly seized every opportunity of communication with the preacher. He had never before sought human communion or sympathy. He soon became a convert; his fierce manner was changed to gentleness; he no longer avoided his fellows; and though still reserved and silent, it seemed to me that his religion brought him back to the human family, and by uniting him to the common Father of all, restored the broken links of fraternity. “Whether his faith had an enfeebling influence on his body as well as his mind, I know not; but his health fell into decay. The overseer complained that he kept long vigils after his daily labour; that he spent the nights which were made to prepare him for his labour, in prayers that exhausted his spirits and his strength. My father inquired of Buckley if he had used the whip; the wretch replied, that he never entered a complaint till that remedy had failed, It did no more good, he said, to whip him, than to beat the air; he bore it without complaint, and without shrinking. My father then recommended an abatement of Africk's daily food. “That,” Buckley said, “he had tried till the rascal was so weak he could scarcely stand. I was present at this conference, and my nature rebelled against the intolerable oppression the poor wretch was suffering. I interposed, and entreated my father to adopt kind treatment. “He swore at my boyish impertinence, as he called it; but it was not, however, without effect, for he recommended to Buckley milder usage. But the fellow's habits of cruelty were too firmly fixed for any essential change. It was not long after that Africk interposed to rescue a female slave from the horrible lash of this tyrant: his fury, averted from the woman, fell with redoubled violence on Africk, till no longer stimulated by resistance, he turned away from his silent victim, and left him to crawl (for he could not walk) to his little cabin. The following morning he was missing; the plantation was searched in vain, and I was despatched by my father in quest of him, as he deemed it probable that some of the negroes of our neighbours might have harboured and concealed him; these sort of courtesies being not unfrequent among our slaves. “I went, but with the determination never to reveal, if I discovered his concealment, and to afford him every aid in my power, for my youthful imagination had been powerfully excited by his heroism and his sufferings, and neither philosophy nor experience had yet steeled my heart against the spectacle of human misery. Would to God they never had! “I began my expedition on foot, being just then inspired with a passion to emulate the feats of some European pedestrians, of whom I had heard. I cannot remember a period of my life when some such whim did not rule the hour. I had entered on Mr. Westall's grounds, and in order to cross by a straight line to the cabins of the negroes, I left the circuitous road, and turned into some low ground, covered with pines. It soon became marshy, and almost impassable, but I had proceeded too far for retreat or extrication, and I continued to push forward through the snarled bushes and interwoven branches of the trees; the daylight and my strength were almost exhausted, and my patience entirely, when I perceived the ground harden to my tread, and pressing eagerly forward, I issued from the wood into an open space, a few roods in circumference, around which the trees grew so thick, that they formed an almost impenetrable wall, a natural defence for this sequestered retreat. To my amazement I saw before me, and just on the skirt of the wood, a rudely constructed hut; two of its sides were formed by slabs resting on the ground at one end, meeting at the top, and supported by poles inserted into two notched posts; the third side was filled by brush cut from the adjoining wood, and piled loosely together; the fourth, towards which I advanced, was quite open to the weather. “Alsop, I had proceeded thus far in my narrative, when I threw down my pen; my fancy had restored me to this scene of my youth; I had insensibly reverted to the influences that then governed my mind, and I felt that I was exposing the offices of the temple to the derision of the unbelievers. I protest against your laugh, and your more intolerable ridicule: I know all these things are the illusions of youth and ignorance, but I sometimes think them better, certainly far happier, than the realities I have since adopted. Still vacillating, you say between philosophy and superstition! amiable superstition! I have described this spot with some particularity. It is, with all its accompaniments, indelibly stamped on my memory. As I said, I advanced towards the habitation, and unperceived by its occupants, I had leisure to observe and to listen to them. Africk was lying extended on some straw with which the ground (for there was no floor) had been strewn for this slight accommodation; his head was supported by an old negro woman; with one hand he grasped the hand of my friend, with the other he held firmly a saphie, which was suspended around his neck; his short and spasmodic breathing indicated the last feeble struggle with death. “Edmund Westall knelt beside him, and might have been mistaken for a bright vision from another and a higher sphere, so beautiful was the combination of faith, hope, and charity, as the enthusiast paints them, in his fair and innocent face. The last rays of the setting sun entering an aperture in the wall, fell athwart his brow, burnished his light brown hair, and rested there, a bright halo, which seemed the seal of the celestial ministry. My ear caught the broken sentence of the dying man. “`No no,' he said; `Mr. Edmund, I had no peace. I would have given my life for one moment of freedom. I looked for revenge. I thought of my wife and my little ones; and I could have poured out the blood of white men, till it should run like the big waters over which they brought us. But the voice of God pierced to my heart; and I was an altered man. And when I prayed that blessed prayer, that I might be forgiven even as I forgive others, the fire in my heart was quenched, and the terrible storm that had raged here (and he pressed Edmund's hand on his naked breast) was laid; and there was peace, Mr. Edmund; God's peace. I was a slave, and I was wretched, but the sting was taken away. Do not pray for me, nor for mine. I have been on my knees for my helpless ones, night after night, and all night long, and my prayer is heard. But pray for your father's land, and your father's children. Pray to be saved from the curse that is coming. Oh! (he exclaimed,) and his voice became stronger, and his deep tones seemed to bear to our ears the sure words of prophecy; oh, I hear the cry of revenge; I hear the wailings of your wives and your little ones; and I see your fair lands drenched with their blood. Pray to God to save you in that day, for it will surely come.' His voice was spent; his eyes closed, as I believed for ever, and I sprang towards the bed. I then perceived that it was a momentary exhaustion; he still grasped Edmund's hand, and I noticed the feeble beatings of his heart. The old woman signed to me to withdraw from before him; and I silently took my station beside her. After a few moments, he again languidly opened his eyes and said, in a scarcely audible voice, `I thought I was in my own land; and I heard the rustling of our leaves, and the voices of my kindred, and I was feeding my little ones with their kouskous as when the destroyers came. My spirit will pass easier, if I hear the voice of your prayer, blessed young man. Pray for my master; for Buckley.' He paused; and Edmund, in a low tender voice, began his supplication. At the close of each petition Africk murmured amen; VOL. I. E and at Edmund's fervent intercession for his oppressors, he opened his eyes, clasped his hands and in the intensity of his feeling, half rose from the straw. The effort exhausted him; he sunk back on the breast of the old woman, and expired. She released herself from him, and then stretching her arms towards Heaven, as if in acknowledgment to Him who had broken the bonds of Africk's captivity, she clapped her hands and shouted, `he is free! he is free!' Edmund and I laid our faces together on the straw beside the poor negro, and wept as youth is wont to do. “Forgive me, Alsop, I have told you a very long, and it may be a very dull story, though I think not; for nothing is dull to you that is connected with the philosophy of the human mind. You will ridicule me for ever having deemed of importance the particulars of a vulgar being, extinct after a few years of life, and that for the most part passed in abject slavery; but like a true philosopher, you will with me eagerly explore the past for the causes that have influenced my character and governed my destiny. And yet, `poor play things of unpitying fate,' why should we be so anxious to penetrate the mysteries of a being which may cease for ever to-morrow? The epicureans were more consistent than we are; and we may learn from the author of a faith that we deride, the truest wisdom for us; `let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' “This scene has haunted my imagination: the memory of it has sometimes seemed to me like a voice from Heaven; for a long while it kept alive a dying spark of faith. I cherished it as a testimony, that God had not left the creatures he had formed to wander without him in the world: I fancied there was a supernatural ministry to the spirit of this much-injured man, that had converted his just and unrelenting hatred to forgiveness—his pride to submissiveness—and there seemed a witness to the E 2 mercy of Heaven in the gentle and tender countenance of my friend. “Yes, Alsop, I confess it—the memory of this scene has sometimes been an impassable barrier to your infidel and most ingenious arguments. “You know one of the boldest, as well as one of the most charming of female sceptics, said, `in the silence of the closet, or the dryness of discussion, I can agree with the atheist or the materialist, as to the insolubility of certain questions; but when in the country, or contemplating nature, my soul, full of emotion, soars aloft to the vivifying principle that animates them, to the almighty intellect that pervades them, and to the goodness that makes the scene so delightful to my senses!' “Thus it is with me: nature and the beautiful traits of nature we sometimes see in man, appeal irresistibly to my feelings, and force their way to my convictions. “My purpose was, frankly to tell you my present embarrassments; but I have been led into too serious a train of feeling to proceed any farther, and certainly to let you into the arcana of my present perplexities. “I explained to Edmund my intentions in regard to Africk. We found that we had participated in a strong feeling of compassion towards him, and this sympathy at once created a bond of union between us. This hiding-place had been contrived by Westall's people for a refuge for the runaways from the neighbouring plantations; not at all for their own benefit, for the conduct of the Westalls to their slaves was noted for its benevolent and paternal character. The retreat was kept secret from Mr. Westall, (the father;) for the negroes rightly concluded that he would have been compelled in honour to surrender, as the property of his neighbours, the refugees who took shelter there. The son had been conducted to the place by the old woman, who was his nurse, who knew she might safely confide the secret to his custody, and who could not believe that any case was so desperate that he could not bring some alleviation to it. We agreed that Africk's body should be conveyed during the night to the cabin of one of the negroes, and should in the morning be restored to my father. “Before we parted from the remains of the released slave, we examined the saphie, which to his last breath, he had so pertinaciously grasped. You must know these saphies, are boxes made of horn, shell, or some other durable mate rial; they contain some charon, usually a sentence from the Koran, which serves as an amulet to keep off evil spirits. Africk had changed the object of his superstition, and the infidel charm had been expelled to give place to the following sentence, written at his request by Westall: `Forgive me my trespasses, even as I forgive those who trespass against me.' “At Edmund's instigation, I made this the occasion of benefit to the other negroes. I applied to my father in their behalf, and found my way to his understanding by the sure and well-trodden path of selfishness. I convinced him that Buckley's cruelty had shortened Africk's life, and that the tyrant's harsh treatment of the slaves prevented half the profit that might otherwise be derived from their labour. My father, exasperated by his recent loss, readily yielded to my arguments. Buckley was dismissed, and an efficient and tolerably humane overseer employed in his place. I possessed then, Alsop, some enthusiasm in the cause of benevolence, and could have envied, and possibly might have emulated the fame of a Howard. But notwithstanding this strange confession, you need not now despair of your disciple and friend, “H. Redwood.” This epistle very naturally excited some alarm in Alsop for the security of his dominion over the mind of his young disciple. He wrote to him repeatedly, and received but few, and those brief replies, till about the expiration of a year, when an answer to an earnest solicitation to Redwood to accompany him to Europe, whither he was going in a public service, and to his setting forth in the most tempting manner the advantages that he offered, he received the following letter: “Dear Alsop, “I am grateful for your interest, and convinced by your arguments that I ought no longer to doze away my brief existence in this retirement. I have obtained my father's consent to the arrangement you propose; and what is still more indispensable, an ample supply in consideration of a promise I have given to him, that I will solicit the hand of my cousin immediately after my return. “Alsop, I find it necessary to recollect all the arguments in favour of virtue and vice being only conventional terms, artificial contrivances for man's convenience; for conscience, conscience, `that blushing shame-faced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom,' tells me that if it is not so, I am the veriest wretch alive. I am married to a young creature without fortune, without connexions; innocent, and beautiful, and religious; an odd union, is it not? I have not intimated my free opinions to her, for why should I disturb her superstition? It is quite becoming to a woman, harmonizes well with the weakness of her sex, and is perhaps necessary to it. No one but the priest (and he is trust-worthy) knows our secret. My pride, my ambition, rebel against the humble condition of life to which this rash indulgence of boyish passion condemns me. If my father knew it, he would spurn me; for my marriage disappoints his favourite E 3 project, and my poor girl would provoke his most inveterate prejudices; and my mother, my timid mother, would never forgive me for presuming to offend my father: there is no tolerable alternative; the fact must be concealed for the present. Who knows but one of the tides, which, `taken at the flood lead on to fortune,' may await me? any thing is better than to lose this bright opportunity of pleasure and advantage. Poor Westall is dead, and died with unbroken confidence in my virtue. Is goodness thus credulous? He has committed his only son, a boy of four years, to my guardianship. I will not betray his trust, so help me God. “Yours, &amp;c. H. R.” Redwood had determined to keep his intended departure a secret, to save himself from the remonstrances and entreaties which he naturally expected from his abused wife. He had no intention permanently to desert her: she was residing in the family of a Mr. Emlyn, as teacher to his children, and might remain there for one, or even two years if necessary; and in the meantime, an unforeseen accession of fortune, political advancement, or any of the thousand chances that happen to fortune's favourites, might relieve her husband from his present embarrassments, and enable him to invest her with her rights without too great a personal sacrifice. By such and similar considerations he endeavoured to soothe his conscience into acquiescence; but neither these, nor the sophistries of his friend, availed him to silence the voice of nature within him, that incessantly reproached him with the wrong he was about to inflict on a young, and innocent, and helpless being. On the night before his departure, he summoned resolution to visit her, intending to impart to her his designs, and to soothe her with such promises and arguments as he could marshal to his aid. He found her alone in the little parlour, which had been kindly assigned to her. She started at his entrance, and was hurrying a sheet of paper on which she was writing into the desk at which she sat. “Treason, treason,” said he, detaining the paper, and at the same time kissing her pale cheek. “Then it is treason against my own heart,” she replied, “for that is but too faithful to you.” Redwood was conscience-stricken, and to shelter his embarrassment, he affected to read the letter he had seized: it was blotted with his wife's tears. “No, do not read it,” said she, laying her hand on it, “it is only a little scolding; you know I have so few of the privileges of a wife, that I cannot but use those that are not denied me.” Redwood's eyes were still fixed on the letter, of which, however, he had not read a single word. She continued, “I am so lonely, that I get low-spirited, and sometimes I think you do not love me.” “Not love you, Mary?” exclaimed Redwood, in whose breast there was not at this moment any feeling so strong as his tenderness for the lovely being before him. “Yes, Henry,” she replied, with more courage than she had ever before shown, “and have I not much reason to think so? I am sure I could not make any one suffer as you make me; I could not live and let such a curse rest upon your blessings.” “A curse, Mary, what do you mean?” replied her husband. “Oh, is it not a curse,” said she, “to feel the misery of guilt and the punishment of folly; to be suspected of crime; to feel the blood freezing in my veins, from the fear of detection; to see, or fancy that I see, the smiles of derision and contempt on the faces of the very slaves of the plantation, as I pass by them; and to blush and feel humbled, when, at the mention of your name, my eye meets the stolen glances of the children? Oh Henry, I am a woman, and I cannot bear such suspicions; I am a wife, and I ought not to bear them.” Redwood was affected by his wife's appeal; but there was in it an assertion of rights that mortified his pride and surprised him; surprised him, because Mary had always showed herself a timid being, with unquestioning dependence on his will, and submissive conformity to his wishes. He defended himself as well as he was able: he pleaded his dependence on his father—his dread to excite his tyrannical passions; he reminded her that she had consented to their clandestine marriage and intercourse. “But,” she replied, “I was young and inexperienced, and quite alone; and I thought, Henry, you could not ask me to do any thing it was not right to do; and you promised, before God, to love and cherish me, and I was quite sure I never should suffer any evil that you could shield me from.” “And you shall not, Mary,” he replied; “only have a little patience.” “Ah, Henry, patience is the resource of the miserable; and I,” she added, turning on him a look full of the confiding spirit of affection, “I ought not to be miserable.” “But what can I do?” said he impatiently. “Withhold no longer the name to which you have given me a right; save me from cruel suspicions and remarks, and I will endure silently and patiently any other evil; I will live separate from you, if your father requires it, or you wish it; I will never see you again; any thing will be better than to endure the torment of shame, for from this torment the consciousness of innocence has not preserved me.” Redwood felt the justice of his wife's cause, and he might have yielded to the best impulses of his nature, but he thought he had gone too far with Alsop to recede; he mentally resolved to shorten his absence as much as possible, and to return to make his wife happy. Having appeased his conscience by this compromise, he appealed to her compassion; he represented, with tenfold aggravation, the embarrassments in which he was involved, and he soothed her with professions of tenderness. Gentle and affectionate, she soon relapsed into trustful acquiescence, and, with a self-devotion not singular in a woman, she resolved and promised to abide his pleasure. Before they parted, there was an allusion made to a flirtation Redwood had had with his cousin Maria Manning, and to some tender letters she had written to him since his marriage, to win him back from what she supposed to be his indifference. These letters had frequently been the subject of raillery between the lovers. Mary had never seen them; and Redwood, in no humour now to deny any thing which he could grant without too great a sacrifice, promised he would send her the letters the next morning. He then parted from her, but not without betraying real anguish, which his tender-hearted wife blamed herself for having inflicted on him. The next morning a pacquet was brought to her. It continued a brief farewell from her husband, the most plausible apology he could frame for his departure, and a sum of money larger than he could well afford to spare from the allowance that he had received from his father, but by which, as he said, he meant to enable her to withdraw (if she should prefer to do so during his absence) from the situation she then held. In the hurry of his departure Redwood had sent, instead of the promised pacquet, his correspondence with Alsop. What a revelation it contained for his deserted wife! She had reposed in him the unqualified and unsuspecting confidence of youth; she had believed him to be just what he seemed—the natural conclusion of inexperience. How terrible are the reverses of opinion, when those most tenderly loved are the subjects of them! It seemed to Mary Redwood, that she had fallen into an abyss of hopeless misery. She read over and over again these fatal letters, till her head turned, and heart sunk with the strange confusion of horrible ideas which they communicated. The language of the world, of philosophy, (falsely so called) of infidelity, was an unknown tongue to her; a strange jargon, which introduced into her mind but one definite idea, and that a deep conviction that her husband was corrupt, more corrupt in principle than in conduct; and his conduct the natural and necessary result of his principles. Ignorant as she was of the world, and all its intolerance and artificial distinctions, she had never dreamed that her lowly fortune and rank opposed a barrier to her acknowledgment. The love of women is sometimes ranked with incurable diseases. Mary Redwood's at least was not so; perhaps her husband seemed to her to lose his identity from the moment that she discovered his real sentiments; however that may be, the discovery cut the cord that bound her to him; and the repose and happiness of trustful affection, and feminine dependence, and the confidence of youthful expectation, gave place to deep despondency, and to all the apathy of complete alienation. It was impossible for her to conceal a change so suddenly wrought in her feelings, and the good people with whom she was living, believed young Redwood's departure for Europe to be the cause of it. They had for a long time been apprised of his secret visits, and suspicious of his designs; but the purity and gentleness of Mary's manners rebuked suspicion, and they hesitated to communicate their observations to her: besides they were engaged with their own concerns, and the transient love affair (as they deemed it) of an obscure young girl, seemed to them of no great moment. They felt some regret, when, after the lapse of a few days, she announced her wish to relinquish the care of their children, assigning as a reason the evident decline of her health, and she did not leave them without generous tokens of their gratitude for her fidelity. At the time of her departure, her friend, Mrs. Westall, was absent on a visit to a distant plantation; this she esteemed fortunate, for she wished to escape any observation that would have been stimulated by affection. She resolved never to reveal the secret of her marriage; and thanking God that her parents were removed from this world, and that none remained to be deeply affected with her misfortunes, she determined to seek out some retreat where she might be sheltered from notice. As the carriage drove away that conveyed her from the door of Mr. Emlyn, Mrs. Emlyn turned from the window where she had stood gazing after her, and said to her husband, “is it not strange that Mary should not have felt more at parting with the children? she did not seem to notice their caresses, and poor things, they cried as if their little hearts would break; she is kind-hearted too.” “And did you not mind mother,” asked one of the little girls, “that when I offered that pretty shell-box Mr. Redwood gave me for a keepsake, she shivered as if she had the ague, and dropped it on the floor?” “Ah,” said Mr. Emlyn, looking significantly at his wife, “it is easy enough to see where the shoe pinches. I tell you my dear, that fellow has nearly broken the girl's heart. It is just so with all your tribe; `all for love, or the world well lost.' But she will come to her senses. `Sur les aile du temps la tristesse s'envole.”'</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Some months have elapsed, dear Alsop, since we parted, and parted with a truly juvenile promise to keep up an unremitting epistolary intercourse. And this I believe is the first essay made by either of us; a fair illustration of the common proportion which performance bears to such promises. You, no doubt, have been roving from pleasure to pleasure, with an untiring impulse, and your appetite, like the horse-leech, has still cried, `give, give.' If one of your vagrant thoughts has strayed after me, you have doubtless fancied me immured in my study, pursuing my free inquiries, abandoning the fallen systems of vulgar invention, and soaring far over the misty atmosphere of imposture and credulity. Or, perhaps, you deem that I have adopted your sapient advice, have returned to my home a dutiful child, gracefully worn the chains of filial obedience, made my best bow to papa, and with a, `just as you please, Sir,' fallen, secundum artem, desperately in love with my beautiful, and beautifully rich cousin; have rather taken than asked her willing hand, and thus opened for myself the path of ambition, or the golden gates that lead to the regions of pleasure, and which none but fortune's hand can open, But, alas! the most reasonable hopes are disappointed by our fantastic destiny. We are the sport of chance; and as we confess no other deity, you are bound not to deride any of the whimsical dilemmas into which his votaries are led. Alsop, you have often commended the boldness of my mind, while you laughed at a certain involuntary homage I paid to the beautiful pictures of goodness, which some dreaming enthusiasts have presented to us, or to the moral beauty which among all the varieties of accidental combination, is sometimes exhibited in real life. “Have I prepared you to hear the confession that I am at this present moment the blind and willing dupe of goodness, (I mean what the moralists call goodness,) embodied in a form that might soften a stoic, convert an infidel, or perform any other miracle. “You have heard me make honourable mention of my friend Westall. He is by some years my elder, three or four at least. I think I never related the circumstances of our introduction to each other; I am quite certain I did not, for you would have laughed at them; they may now serve to elucidate to you my friend's character, and to account for our early and reciprocal interest. “My father had among his servants a native African; one of those men whom nature has endowed with a giant frame, and correspondent qualities of mind. At the time my father purchased him, he was separated from his wife and two children, girls; the only boy my father purchased with him, whether because he thought the presence of the child would help to keep the father in heart, or from a transient feeling of compassion for the poor wretch, I know not. The wife had suffered deplorably from the voyage, and was knocked down with her two girls to a Georgian for a trifle. You do not know my father: suffice it to say, that selfishness and habit have made him quite insensible to the sufferings of these poor devils, whom he classes with other brutes born for our service. But there was something extraordinary in the strong affections and unconquerable temper of this man. His wife and little ones were torn from his strong grasp, and when resistance was hopeless, and he turned from them, the large muscles of his neck swelled almost to bursting, and he set up a desperate howl, that made every heart quake or melt. Some one of the throng around him, put his boy into his arms: the sight of him changed the current of his feelings; he soon became silent, and, a few moments after, his tears fell thick and heavy on the child. My father brought him home. He performed his appointed tasks well, but he was retired and sulky, and the smallest services that were imposed on his child seemed to exasperate his spirit. It was not many months after he came into our possession, that our overseer, a cruel worthless dog, beat the child who had unwarily offended him, unmercifully. The father interposed and rescued the child at the expense of some cutting lashes on his own back, which he seemed to regard no more than the idle wind. The very night after, the child disappeared, and it was believed the unhappy father had put an end to the boy's life. The fact was never ascertained, though no one doubted it; for as you will readily believe my father was not very zealous to establish a truth which would have deprived him of one of his most valuable slaves. These circumstances transpired before I was old enough to remember them; but when I first heard the report of them among our domestic annals, I felt an involuntary respect for this man, who with a spirit more noble than Cato's, cut the cord that bound his son to captivity, and manfully continued to endure the galling of his own chains. Was not this a glorious illustration of the truth of our old friend Seneca's remark, that `sometimes to live is magnanimity?' “Time passed on, but Africk (for that was the name my father had given him,) remained unaltered. I think I see him now, going to his daily task, always apart from the herd, and quite alone; his firm and slow step, the curling of his lip, which would have better become a monarch than a slave, and his fixed downcast eye. “His mind, which like adamant had resisted the influence of time, was at last subdued by fanaticism, which you know, like some chemical powers, will dissolve substances that no chemical force can impress. My father (a little alarmed himself, as I suspect, by an eloquent harangue,) permitted a zealous Methodist or Moravian, I am not certain which, but a member of one of these tribes of amiable madmen, to address his people. A great sensation was produced, and among the rest, Africk eagerly seized every opportunity of communication with the preacher. He had never before sought human communion or sympathy. He soon became a convert; his fierce manner was changed to gentleness; he no longer avoided his fellows; and though still reserved and silent, it seemed to me that his religion brought him back to the human family, and by uniting him to the common Father of all, restored the broken links of fraternity. “Whether his faith had an enfeebling influence on his body as well as his mind, I know not; but his health fell into decay. The overseer complained that he kept long vigils after his daily labour; that he spent the nights which were made to prepare him for his labour, in prayers that exhausted his spirits and his strength. My father inquired of Buckley if he had used the whip; the wretch replied, that he never entered a complaint till that remedy had failed, It did no more good, he said, to whip him, than to beat the air; he bore it without complaint, and without shrinking. My father then recommended an abatement of Africk's daily food. “That,” Buckley said, “he had tried till the rascal was so weak he could scarcely stand. I was present at this conference, and my nature rebelled against the intolerable oppression the poor wretch was suffering. I interposed, and entreated my father to adopt kind treatment. “He swore at my boyish impertinence, as he called it; but it was not, however, without effect, for he recommended to Buckley milder usage. But the fellow's habits of cruelty were too firmly fixed for any essential change. It was not long after that Africk interposed to rescue a female slave from the horrible lash of this tyrant: his fury, averted from the woman, fell with redoubled violence on Africk, till no longer stimulated by resistance, he turned away from his silent victim, and left him to crawl (for he could not walk) to his little cabin. The following morning he was missing; the plantation was searched in vain, and I was despatched by my father in quest of him, as he deemed it probable that some of the negroes of our neighbours might have harboured and concealed him; these sort of courtesies being not unfrequent among our slaves. “I went, but with the determination never to reveal, if I discovered his concealment, and to afford him every aid in my power, for my youthful imagination had been powerfully excited by his heroism and his sufferings, and neither philosophy nor experience had yet steeled my heart against the spectacle of human misery. Would to God they never had! “I began my expedition on foot, being just then inspired with a passion to emulate the feats of some European pedestrians, of whom I had heard. I cannot remember a period of my life when some such whim did not rule the hour. I had entered on Mr. Westall's grounds, and in order to cross by a straight line to the cabins of the negroes, I left the circuitous road, and turned into some low ground, covered with pines. It soon became marshy, and almost impassable, but I had proceeded too far for retreat or extrication, and I continued to push forward through the snarled bushes and interwoven branches of the trees; the daylight and my strength were almost exhausted, and my patience entirely, when I perceived the ground harden to my tread, and pressing eagerly forward, I issued from the wood into an open space, a few roods in circumference, around which the trees grew so thick, that they formed an almost impenetrable wall, a natural defence for this sequestered retreat. To my amazement I saw before me, and just on the skirt of the wood, a rudely constructed hut; two of its sides were formed by slabs resting on the ground at one end, meeting at the top, and supported by poles inserted into two notched posts; the third side was filled by brush cut from the adjoining wood, and piled loosely together; the fourth, towards which I advanced, was quite open to the weather. “Alsop, I had proceeded thus far in my narrative, when I threw down my pen; my fancy had restored me to this scene of my youth; I had insensibly reverted to the influences that then governed my mind, and I felt that I was exposing the offices of the temple to the derision of the unbelievers. I protest against your laugh, and your more intolerable ridicule: I know all these things are the illusions of youth and ignorance, but I sometimes think them better, certainly far happier, than the realities I have since adopted. Still vacillating, you say between philosophy and superstition! amiable superstition! I have described this spot with some particularity. It is, with all its accompaniments, indelibly stamped on my memory. As I said, I advanced towards the habitation, and unperceived by its occupants, I had leisure to observe and to listen to them. Africk was lying extended on some straw with which the ground (for there was no floor) had been strewn for this slight accommodation; his head was supported by an old negro woman; with one hand he grasped the hand of my friend, with the other he held firmly a saphie, which was suspended around his neck; his short and spasmodic breathing indicated the last feeble struggle with death. “Edmund Westall knelt beside him, and might have been mistaken for a bright vision from another and a higher sphere, so beautiful was the combination of faith, hope, and charity, as the enthusiast paints them, in his fair and innocent face. The last rays of the setting sun entering an aperture in the wall, fell athwart his brow, burnished his light brown hair, and rested there, a bright halo, which seemed the seal of the celestial ministry. My ear caught the broken sentence of the dying man. “`No no,' he said; `Mr. Edmund, I had no peace. I would have given my life for one moment of freedom. I looked for revenge. I thought of my wife and my little ones; and I could have poured out the blood of white men, till it should run like the big waters over which they brought us. But the voice of God pierced to my heart; and I was an altered man. And when I prayed that blessed prayer, that I might be forgiven even as I forgive others, the fire in my heart was quenched, and the terrible storm that had raged here (and he pressed Edmund's hand on his naked breast) was laid; and there was peace, Mr. Edmund; God's peace. I was a slave, and I was wretched, but the sting was taken away. Do not pray for me, nor for mine. I have been on my knees for my helpless ones, night after night, and all night long, and my prayer is heard. But pray for your father's land, and your father's children. Pray to be saved from the curse that is coming. Oh! (he exclaimed,) and his voice became stronger, and his deep tones seemed to bear to our ears the sure words of prophecy; oh, I hear the cry of revenge; I hear the wailings of your wives and your little ones; and I see your fair lands drenched with their blood. Pray to God to save you in that day, for it will surely come.' His voice was spent; his eyes closed, as I believed for ever, and I sprang towards the bed. I then perceived that it was a momentary exhaustion; he still grasped Edmund's hand, and I noticed the feeble beatings of his heart. The old woman signed to me to withdraw from before him; and I silently took my station beside her. After a few moments, he again languidly opened his eyes and said, in a scarcely audible voice, `I thought I was in my own land; and I heard the rustling of our leaves, and the voices of my kindred, and I was feeding my little ones with their kouskous as when the destroyers came. My spirit will pass easier, if I hear the voice of your prayer, blessed young man. Pray for my master; for Buckley.' He paused; and Edmund, in a low tender voice, began his supplication. At the close of each petition Africk murmured amen; VOL. I. E and at Edmund's fervent intercession for his oppressors, he opened his eyes, clasped his hands and in the intensity of his feeling, half rose from the straw. The effort exhausted him; he sunk back on the breast of the old woman, and expired. She released herself from him, and then stretching her arms towards Heaven, as if in acknowledgment to Him who had broken the bonds of Africk's captivity, she clapped her hands and shouted, `he is free! he is free!' Edmund and I laid our faces together on the straw beside the poor negro, and wept as youth is wont to do. “Forgive me, Alsop, I have told you a very long, and it may be a very dull story, though I think not; for nothing is dull to you that is connected with the philosophy of the human mind. You will ridicule me for ever having deemed of importance the particulars of a vulgar being, extinct after a few years of life, and that for the most part passed in abject slavery; but like a true philosopher, you will with me eagerly explore the past for the causes that have influenced my character and governed my destiny. And yet, `poor play things of unpitying fate,' why should we be so anxious to penetrate the mysteries of a being which may cease for ever to-morrow? The epicureans were more consistent than we are; and we may learn from the author of a faith that we deride, the truest wisdom for us; `let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.' “This scene has haunted my imagination: the memory of it has sometimes seemed to me like a voice from Heaven; for a long while it kept alive a dying spark of faith. I cherished it as a testimony, that God had not left the creatures he had formed to wander without him in the world: I fancied there was a supernatural ministry to the spirit of this much-injured man, that had converted his just and unrelenting hatred to forgiveness—his pride to submissiveness—and there seemed a witness to the E 2 mercy of Heaven in the gentle and tender countenance of my friend. “Yes, Alsop, I confess it—the memory of this scene has sometimes been an impassable barrier to your infidel and most ingenious arguments. “You know one of the boldest, as well as one of the most charming of female sceptics, said, `in the silence of the closet, or the dryness of discussion, I can agree with the atheist or the materialist, as to the insolubility of certain questions; but when in the country, or contemplating nature, my soul, full of emotion, soars aloft to the vivifying principle that animates them, to the almighty intellect that pervades them, and to the goodness that makes the scene so delightful to my senses!' “Thus it is with me: nature and the beautiful traits of nature we sometimes see in man, appeal irresistibly to my feelings, and force their way to my convictions. “My purpose was, frankly to tell you my present embarrassments; but I have been led into too serious a train of feeling to proceed any farther, and certainly to let you into the arcana of my present perplexities. “I explained to Edmund my intentions in regard to Africk. We found that we had participated in a strong feeling of compassion towards him, and this sympathy at once created a bond of union between us. This hiding-place had been contrived by Westall's people for a refuge for the runaways from the neighbouring plantations; not at all for their own benefit, for the conduct of the Westalls to their slaves was noted for its benevolent and paternal character. The retreat was kept secret from Mr. Westall, (the father;) for the negroes rightly concluded that he would have been compelled in honour to surrender, as the property of his neighbours, the refugees who took shelter there. The son had been conducted to the place by the old woman, who was his nurse, who knew she might safely confide the secret to his custody, and who could not believe that any case was so desperate that he could not bring some alleviation to it. We agreed that Africk's body should be conveyed during the night to the cabin of one of the negroes, and should in the morning be restored to my father. “Before we parted from the remains of the released slave, we examined the saphie, which to his last breath, he had so pertinaciously grasped. You must know these saphies, are boxes made of horn, shell, or some other durable mate rial; they contain some charon, usually a sentence from the Koran, which serves as an amulet to keep off evil spirits. Africk had changed the object of his superstition, and the infidel charm had been expelled to give place to the following sentence, written at his request by Westall: `Forgive me my trespasses, even as I forgive those who trespass against me.' “At Edmund's instigation, I made this the occasion of benefit to the other negroes. I applied to my father in their behalf, and found my way to his understanding by the sure and well-trodden path of selfishness. I convinced him that Buckley's cruelty had shortened Africk's life, and that the tyrant's harsh treatment of the slaves prevented half the profit that might otherwise be derived from their labour. My father, exasperated by his recent loss, readily yielded to my arguments. Buckley was dismissed, and an efficient and tolerably humane overseer employed in his place. I possessed then, Alsop, some enthusiasm in the cause of benevolence, and could have envied, and possibly might have emulated the fame of a Howard. But notwithstanding this strange confession, you need not now despair of your disciple and friend, “H. Redwood.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Dear Alsop, “I am grateful for your interest, and convinced by your arguments that I ought no longer to doze away my brief existence in this retirement. I have obtained my father's consent to the arrangement you propose; and what is still more indispensable, an ample supply in consideration of a promise I have given to him, that I will solicit the hand of my cousin immediately after my return. “Alsop, I find it necessary to recollect all the arguments in favour of virtue and vice being only conventional terms, artificial contrivances for man's convenience; for conscience, conscience, `that blushing shame-faced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom,' tells me that if it is not so, I am the veriest wretch alive. I am married to a young creature without fortune, without connexions; innocent, and beautiful, and religious; an odd union, is it not? I have not intimated my free opinions to her, for why should I disturb her superstition? It is quite becoming to a woman, harmonizes well with the weakness of her sex, and is perhaps necessary to it. No one but the priest (and he is trust-worthy) knows our secret. My pride, my ambition, rebel against the humble condition of life to which this rash indulgence of boyish passion condemns me. If my father knew it, he would spurn me; for my marriage disappoints his favourite E 3 project, and my poor girl would provoke his most inveterate prejudices; and my mother, my timid mother, would never forgive me for presuming to offend my father: there is no tolerable alternative; the fact must be concealed for the present. Who knows but one of the tides, which, `taken at the flood lead on to fortune,' may await me? any thing is better than to lose this bright opportunity of pleasure and advantage. Poor Westall is dead, and died with unbroken confidence in my virtue. Is goodness thus credulous? He has committed his only son, a boy of four years, to my guardianship. I will not betray his trust, so help me God. “Yours, &amp;c. H. R.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV. "Si un homme honnête avoit fait un mal irreparable à un être innocent comment, sans le secours de l'expiation religieuse, s'en consolerait-il jamais." Mad. de Stael Redwood joined his friend, and they embarked together for Europe, furnished with every facility for an introduction to good society which Americans could then procure. They visited Paris, and gained admission to its highest literary circles: to society the most dangerous, and the most captivating, men and women, who from having been born thralls to the despotic dogmas and pompous ritual of the Romish church, had identified the corruptions of Christianity with its truth, and rejecting the galling yoke, had loosened all necessary and salutary restraints. There was in them much to be admired by a virtuous person, much to excite the sympathy of the representative of a young republic, for they had an unaffected zeal for the happiness of their species, and a genuine hatred of every mode of tyranny. They had too an amenity and exquisite refinement of manners, which they owed to the vital spirit that Christianity had infused into civilized life, and which remained after the spirit had departed; as the body from which the soul has fled retains, while life is still recent, its fair proportions, and beautiful expression; or, as a plant which the passing gale has uprooted, is still decorated with the flowers that owed their birth to the parent earth. In these circles, Redwood's devotion to intellectual power (the ruling passion of his youth) revived, and he resigned himself to the charms of society, to those pleasures which one who was their victim, has, with a few vivid touches, described “la parole n'y est pas seulement comme ailleurs un moyen de se communiquev ses idées, ses sentiments, et ses affaires mais c'est un instrument dont on aime à jouer et qui ranime les esprits, comme la musique chez quelque peuples, et les liqueurs fortes chez quelques autres.”[1] [1] Conversation is not there as elsewhere, simply a medium for the communication of ideas and sentiments, and the transaction of business; but it is instrument on which they delight to play, and which excites their spirits, like music among some nations, and strong liquors among others. And in these circles, Redwood felt that Paris “etait lieu du monde où l' on pouvoit le mieux se passer de bonheur.”† † Paris was that place in the whole world where one might best dispense with happiness. While he remained in the French capital, there was no suspension of excitement, not an hour for reflection, VOL. I. F scarcely a solitary moment for the impertinent whispering of conscience. His wife, the young and innocent creature, who had surrendered to him the whole treasure of her affections, abandoned solitary, sick, and heart-broken, was scarcely remembered, or if remembered, was always associated with the dark cloud with which she had shaded his future fortunes. But after he had left Paris, in the further prosecution of his travels, there were times when she was remembered; the powers of conscience, spell-bound by the noise and glare of society, were awakened by the voice of the Divinity issuing from the eloquent places of nature. The pure streams, the placid lakes, the green hills, and the “fixed mountains looking tranquillity,” seemed to reproach him with his desertion of nature's fairer work; for all the works of nature are linked together by an invisible, an “electric chain.” Redwood hurried from place to place; he tried the power of novelty, of activity, he gazed on those objects that have been the marvel, and the delight of the world; and when the first excitement was over, he felt that he could not resist the great moral law which has indissolubly joined virtue and happiness. On his arrival at Rome he found letters awaiting him there. To avoid the hazard of discovery, he had determined that all intercourse between himself and his wife should be suspended during his absence, and had purposely omitted to furnish her with his address— his anxiety to receive some intelligence from her, had, however, become so strong that he would now have willingly incurred any risk for that gratification. On turning over his letters, he noticed one in a hand writing which he recognised to be that of the clergyman who had married him to Mary Erwine; he hastily tore it open. There was within it a letter from his wife, and a few lines F 2 from the clergyman stated that he had received that letter enclosed in another, and post-marked Philadelphia: he was requested to forward it by the first conveyance, and to inform him to whom it was addressed, that the writer had died two days after closing the letter. Alsop entered Redwood's apartment a moment after he had read the letter, and while he was yet nearly stunned with the sudden blow: Alsop looked at the unsealed letter which had fallen on the floor, and then took the open one from the unresisting hand of his friend, who, while he hid his convulsed face with his hands, exclaimed, “oh, I have killed her, Alsop—I have killed her!” “No, no,” replied Alsop, comprehending at a glance the import of the intelligence, “nature sentenced her; you may have hastened the execution— but that's all. What do you mean by this drivelling, Redwood? Is it thus you receive one of fate's happiest strokes? By my soul, man, I have been a sworn knight to my lady Fortune for these twenty years, following her through good and evil report, and for all my devoted services, I have never obtained one such favour.” There was an audacity in this levity which quickened to keen resentment the awakened feelings of Redwood. He spurned Alsop from him, and resigned himself to the tide of misery that overwhelmed his fortitude. As soon as he could command sufficient courage, he opened his wife's letter—it was cold and brief, without a request or reproach; and simply informed him that after his departure she had sought a retirement where she might prepare herself for that better world, towards which her heavenly Father in his tender mercy was evidently leading her: she had found one; and had received under the humble roof where she should soon close her eyes for ever, every kindness that humanity could render. Should any regrets induce Redwood to make inquiries about her, she informed him they would be vain and useless—vain, for she had taken every precaution to keep the place of her retreat secret—and useless, for she should then be where no human being could confer happiness, or inflict misery on her. Some portions of the letter betrayed strong emotions, but apparently it did not result from the relations which had subsisted between herself and him, to whom she wrote. It was an elevated state of feeling with which no personal considerations seemed to mingle, in which she regarded what had passed, not as offences against herself, but as portending misery to Redwood. The letter concluded thus—“you will not,” she said, “need the assurance of my forgiveness; believe me I have no sterner feeling than pity for you. I have sought, and till my heart is stilled in death, I shall seek for you his mercy who came to heal the sick, to seek the lost, and to restore the wanderer. Farewell, Redwood, God grant the prayer of your dying wife.” “And is this all,” thought Redwood, “that remains to me of the tenderness of youthful love; of that innocent generous affection, that questioned not, suspected not? oh, I have most foully betrayed her trust! we are severed for ever —yes, for ever; for surely if there is a heaven, she has entered it; and I—I have no place—no hope there. I could have borne reproaches, invectives, any thing I could have borne better than this calm tone which pronounces the sentence of death—eternal death to our union.” There is perhaps no keener suffering to a generous mind, than the consciousness of having inflicted a wrong which cannot be repaired. Redwood's first hasty resolution was to make the poor amends in his power, to return to his country, proclaim his marriage with Mary Erwine, and endure the infamy his desertion deserved. No sacrifice appeared to him too great to appease the clamours of his conscience, no self-mortification too severe, if he might thereby pay a tribute to her memory, whose life he had embittered and cut off in its early prime. But after the first access of grief and contrition gave place to calm and natural considerations, he saw that however just might be his conduct, still it must be quite useless to the injured being whom he could no longer serve nor harm. She was an orphan, without any near connexions to inquire after, or to be afflicted by her destiny: why then should he publish his own infamy, which could never be mitigated in the eye of the world by the knowledge of the virtuous intention and severe remorse, which, as Redwood hoped, in some measure softened its deepest colouring? These were certainly reasonable considerations; and though every one must wish that Redwood had followed the simple dictate of right, no one who knows how very cogent arguments appear on that side to which the inclinations lean, will be surprised that his virtuous resolutions should have died away, and his good emotions have subsided; but they did not subside without permanent effects. The wave retreated, but its ravages remained; and Henry Redwood carried through life a fast-rooted misery, a sense of injustice recklessly committed; a feeling of degradation that led him to turn from all that is fair and good, as a sick eye shuts out the light of heaven. Redwood avoided the poisonous society of Alsop. He left Rome after wandering for a little time about its magnificent ruins; the melancholy tone of his mind suiting well with their gloomy grandeur. From Italy he repaired to England, and after rambling over our parent land, F 3 and admiring without enjoying its beauties, he returned to his native country. Quite indifferent to his own domestic fate, he yielded a ready compliance to the importunate wishes of his father and mother, and solicited and easily obtained the hand of his cousin Maria Manning, a spoilt child and flattered beauty. Her girlish preference of her handsome cousin had been stimulated by the difficulty of achieving the conquest of his affections; and if her vanity had been piqued by his long apparent indifference and protracted absence, it was quite soothed by the professedly unqualified admiration of one who had gazed on foreign beauties, and had been received with favour in the circles of rank and fashion in countries more polished than our own. The ceremony of Redwood's marriage was celebrated with all due pomp and circumstance. A troop of gratified friends attended him to the altar, whither he led his beautiful bride, the ido of fashion and the favourite of fortune: one person alone in all the assembly rightly interpreted his faltering voice, restless movements, and changing colour, and the fixed gaze that proved his thoughts intent on the visions of his imagination. It was the same church to which, at twilight, and in secrecy he had led the trustful girl, whose artless tenderness, simple and spiritual beauty, and unsuspecting confidence, haunted him at this moment. The same clergyman officiated who had then recorded his plighted faith. Neither the dogmas of a selfish philosophy, nor the training of the world had indurated Redwood's heart. At the moment the service concluded, he staggered from the side of his bride, and caught hold of the railing around the altar. The clergyman whispered, “you betray yourself, Mr. Redwood.” His father bustling up to him, called him in the same breath, “a lucky dog and an odd fish;” and his young friends crowding around him, mingled with their congratulation well-timed raillery of his timidity. Recovering his self-possession, he parried their attacks skilfully, and apologized to his wife with the adroit courtesy of a well-bred man; and she, with the happy facility of habitual vanity, not knowing what his emotion meant, believed it meant something flattering to herself. Redwood now entered on the career of politics. His wife was the bright cynosure of the fashionable world; and both were the envy of those who form their childish judgments by externals, forgetting that the most brilliant hues are reflected by empty vapours. Mrs Redwood survived her marriage but a few years, and left at her death one child, Caroline, whom she consigned to her mother. The child was accordingly transferred to the care of Mrs. Olney; and conveyed to Charleston, S. Carolina, the residence of that lady, who evinced her grief for the death of her daughter, by lavishing on the child a twofold measure of the indulgences and flatteries that had spoiled the mother. Mrs. Olney's notions of education were not peculiar. In her view, the few accomplishments quite indispensable to a young lady, were dancing, music, and French. To attain them, she used all the arts of persuasion and bribery; she procured a French governess who was a monument of patience; she employed a succession of teachers, that much enduring order, who bore with all long suffering, the young lady's indolence, caprices, and tyranny. At the age of seven, the grandmother's vanity no longer brooking delay, the child was produced at balls and routs, where her singular beauty attracted every eye, and her dexterous, graceful management of her little person, already disciplined to the rules of Vestris, called forth loud applauses. The child and grandmother were alike bewildered with the incense that was offered to the infant belle, and future heiress; and alike unconscious of the sidelong looks of contempt and whispered sneers which their pride and folly provoked. At fourteen Miss. Redwood, according to the universal phrase to express the debût of a young lady, was “brought out,” that is, entered the lists as a candidate for the admiration of fashion, and the pretensions of lovers. At eighteen, the period which has been selected to introduce her to our readers; she was the idol of the fashionable world, and as completely au fait in all its arts and mysteries, as a veteran belle of five-and-twenty. Mr. Redwood had received the noblest gifts of his Creator: a mind that naturally aspired to heaven, and sensibilities that inclined him to all that was pure, and good, and lovely. The worldly advantages he possessed would have been the means of happiness to a vulgar, or even an ordinary character; but they had no control over a spirit that could not endure to be limited to the objects of selfish gratification, to bound its desires and pursuits within the earthy prison-house. After a few years, he, wearied of the toil and strife of political life, resigned its honours, and embarked for Europe, from whence, after having worn out two or three years in a vain effort to escape from the demons of restlessness and ennui, he returned to his own country to seek happiness, where none but the good find it, at home. He was surprised with the ripened beauty of his daughter, but most severely mortified to find her just what he ought to have expected from the influences to which he had abandoned her. He had never felt so strong an affection for the child as would seem to have been natural. His indifference to her mother, the circumstances that preceded his marriage, and perhaps the child's resemblance to the parent, accounted in part for this want of affection; and the carelessness that was the result of it was to be expected from one governed more by casual impulses than principle. Mr. Redwood hoped it was not too late to repair his fault. He perceived that his daughter possessed spirit and talents not quite extinguished by her mode of education and life; and for the purpose of breaking off all unfavourable associations, and removing her from the influence of her doating grandmother, he resolved on a tour through the northern states. Mr. Redwood hoped too that this jaunt might lead to the accomplishment of a project which he had long secretly cherished; a union between his daughter and Charles Westall, the son of his earliest friend. He had transferred to the son the strong affection he bore to his father; and though he had not seen him since his childhood, he had from report, and from an occasional correspondence, conceived the highest opinion of his character. Time and philosophy had failed to subdue Mr. Redwood's ardent temperament: he still pressed on with eagerness to the accomplishment of his wishes, flattering himself all the while that he had ceased to be the dupe of the promises which the future makes to the inexperienced and the hopeful. Mr. Redwood and his daughter had made the fashionable tour, that is to say, had visited the lakes of Niagara, and the Canadas, and had turned their course towards Boston, when the unfortunate accident which has been mentioned put a stop to their progress, and deposited them for a while at the house of a respectable New England farmer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V. “She came—she is gone—we have met— And meet perhaps never again.” Cowper. As the day closed, on which Mr. Redwood's journey had been so suddenly suspended, the full-orbed moon rose above the summit of the highest hills that border the eastern shore of Champlain. Not a vestige of the storm remained, not a cloud stained the clear vault of heaven, and the scene looked the more beautiful as contrasted with its recent turbulence. The vapour was condensed on the low grounds, and instead of impeding the rays of the “bright queen of heaven,” looked as if she had sheltered some favourite spots with a silvery mantle; and the broad lake, glad to be relieved from the stern shadows that shrouded it, smiled and dimpled in the rich flood of light that fell on its bosom, and reflected in its clear mirror the pasture-hills, covered with social herds, that descended to its margin; and the water-loving willow, the chesnut with its horizontal branches and pendant blossoms, and the little trig-birch that shadowed its brim. The location of the farm-houses planted here and there on the surrounding hills was marked by the tall Lombardy poplar, which through our country-towns is every where the sign of a habitation. The moon-beams played on the white dwelling of Mr. Lenox, which had an air of prosperity and refinement above any of its neighbours, from the ample, well fenced fields around it, a colony of barns behind it, and a neat little court-yard containing peach and cherry trees, and rosebushes, and vines skilfully guided around the windows, and all enclosed by a curiously wrought fence, on which the village architect had exhausted all the cunning of his trade. Mr. Lenox's family had retired to their several apartments, excepting those who were appointed to keep their vigils with the sick stranger. He had complained of the closeness of the air, and Deborah had opened doors that communicated by a narrow passage with another apartment. She had then stationed herself near the door, where, after a few moments, her loud breathing announced that she was in a profound sleep. Mr. Redwood observed a female sitting in the passage and obscured by its shadows, who seemed to be stationed there to act as a prompter to Deborah, for whenever he was restless she awoke the sleeper. In the opposite room he perceived the body of the young man he had heard spoken of, the head was placed directly under a window through which the full-moon shone so brightly, that every object was almost as distinctly seen as by the light of day. At another time, or in health, Mr. Redwood would have been quite unmoved by such a spectacle, for death has no heart-stirring associations to him who deems that the “spirit shall vanish into soft air, and we shall be hereafter as though we had never been;” but there are few minds that are independent of the condition of the animal; and Mr. Redwood, weakened by his sufferings, and his imagination stimulated by a large dose of laudanum that had excited instead of composing him, felt himself yielding to the power of busy and bitter fancies. The light graceful figure of the young female as she gently moved to awaken the amazon, seemed to touch some secret spring of his imagination, and once, as he fell into a dreamy state, the wife of his youth was near him, but cold and silent, as the dead form he had just closed his eyes upon, and when he started and awoke and saw the young female standing like a statue in the door-way, he identified her with his vision and exclaimed, “for God's sake speak to me.” Deborah was awakened by the sound, and her coarse voice inquiring what he wanted, restored him at once to realities. She gave him at his request a composing draught, and again resumed her station, and saying she believed she had been almost asleep, she resumed instantly her harsh nasal sounds; the only sounds that broke the stillness of the night, save the falling of the swollen drops of water as they rolled from leaf to leaf on the branches of the trees about the window. By degrees Mr. Redwood became composed, and was just yielding himself to nature's best medicine, when his attention was aroused by the sound of light footsteps approaching the house. He heard the latch of an outer door gently raised, (for here fastenings were considered a superfluity,) and a young girl glided into the opposite room. Mr. Redwood saw that she passed, observed but not molested by his attendant. His attention was now thoroughly excited. She lingered for a moment, apparently from irresolution or timidity, and then throwing aside a shawl in which she had muffled herself, she knelt beside the body of the young man, and removing the covering from his face, she gazed intently upon it: the light fell on her own, still beautiful, though distorted and almost convulsed with the tumult of her feelings. After remaining for a few moments motionless, she laid her burning forehead on the cold breast of the young man, and sobbed passionately. The young lady who had been a passive spectator of the poor girl's involuntary grief, now advanced to shut the door, apparently with the purpose of sheltering her from the observation of the stranger, but he, perceiving her intention, and unable to repress his curiosity, called to entreat her to permit it to remain open. The loud sobs of the girl awakened the grandmother of the deceased, who, reluctant to separate herself for a moment from the body of her grandson, had insisted on performing herself the customary duty of watching with the dead; but overcome with her grief and infirmities, she had fallen asleep. She recognised immediately in the afflicted girl, the object of her child's youthful and constant affections; whose girlish coquetries and caprices had been the first cause of that “inward disease,” which Deborah had pronounced the occasion of his death. She advanced to her with trembling steps, and laying her hand on the girl's head, and stroking back her beautiful hair, “poor silly child,” she said in a pitiful tone, “you have come too late: once his heart would have leaped at a word from you, but he does not hear you now. He loved you, Anne, and for that I cannot help loving you;” and she stooped and kissed the girl, who was awed into silence by her unexpected appearance, and her calm tone. “A grief have you been to him, Anne; but the Lord changed his mourning into joy, for when friend and lover forsook him, then he turned to the sure friend. Oh,” she continued, “he was my last earthly hope, the staff of my age; he was good, always good, but—” and the tears poured down her pale wrinkled face, “but it was his adversities that made him wise unto salvation. Sorrow upon sorrow, cloud upon cloud, and he from the first such a feeling creature.” Mrs. Allen's lamentation was interrupted by the hysterical sobbings of the penitent girl, “My poor child,” she said, in a compassionate tone, “do not break your heart; sore mourning is it indeed for a wrong done to the dead, but it was not you, Anne that killed VOL. I. G him; no, that was just the beginning of it; then came his parent's losses, his father's death, and his mother's; but all these were dust on the balance; time to eternity compared with the backsliding of Emily; his root withered when this branch was lopped off. Oh, my dear boy, how often have I heard you say you would die for her if thereby you could bring her back from her idolatry.” Here the aged mourner was again interrupted, and all were startled by the rumbling of an approaching waggon; the young lady quick as thought, flew to the window. “They are here,” she exclaimed; and then turning to the old woman, “I entreat you dear, dear Mrs. Allen,” she said “to leave the room; indeed you are not able to see them to-night.” “Oh, Ellen, I care not for myself, say not a word; this may be the Lord's set time to call home the wanderer; I will not shrink from the trial, if it was my last breath, I would spend it in setting her sin before her.” “But not now, Mrs. Allen, surely not now; this is not the time to harrow up the poor girl's feelings; consider for one moment she has yet to learn Edward's death; she is exhausted with her journey, spare her, spare yourself to-night.” “Ellen you know not what you ask,” replied the old woman, who seemed to gather strength and energy to obey what she regarded as a call of duty. “Are we not,” she asked, “to pluck out the right eye, to pluck off the right arm, if thereby we may save the soul? Ellen, I will speak to her; and if she is not dead to natural affection, the light of that pale still face will send my words home to her heart.” In vain Ellen argued and entreated. Mrs. Allen seemed persuaded, or as she expressed herself, she felt that now, if G 2 ever, was the set time for the deliverance of the child from captivity. Debby, roused at the near approach of the waggon, and again said, “she did not know but she had been dosing;” and, listening to the bustle in the opposite apartment, “what does all this mean?” said she; “I thought Ellen was fit to be trusted, is there no discretion in a young head?” Mr. Redwood assured her that the young lady had not failed in her duty in the least; that the door had been continued open at his request. “Oh well, well, it is all very well: it is a good rule never to cross the sick in their notions.” While making this sage observation, she advanced to the window. “For the land's sake,” she exclaimed, “what has tempted Susan Allen to come with Emily! It will go nigh to break the old woman's heart to see her. Ah, there will be no good come of it, for there is that old grim master-devil, brother Reuben.” “In the name of heaven,” exclaimed Mr. Redwood, “who is Emily? and who is Susan? am I dreaming, or what does it all mean?” “No man, you are not dreaming, but I guess in your right mind. Emily Allen is a young girl twin sister to Eddy there in the other room; she has been befooled by the shaking quakers, at least by her Aunt Susan, that has been one these thirty years; and Susan is a half crazy woman and half saint; and there is the old woman that is mother to Susan and grandmother to Emily, that is taking on about them as if they were sold to the evil one. But, Sir, we are disobeying Doctor Bristol's orders, and that an't honouring the physician with the honour that is due to him:” and thus concluding, she proceeded to close the door that led through the passage. Mr. Redwood had been beguiled of the tedious sleepless hours, by the curious spectacle of natural feeling, undisguised by any of the artificial modes of society, and he was now determined to see the new characters that were entering on the scene. He entreated Deborah to permit the door to remain open, and she, after examining his pulse, and looking at his eye to detect any incipient wildness, decided that it would not be indiscreet to gratify him. To convey to our readers a clear idea of this scene, we shall describe it as it really occurred, and not as it appeared to Mr. Redwood, who by the dim light, and at the distance he was laid from the parties, was compelled to be satisfied with a very imperfect observation. Ellen opened the outer door for the two females, who entered dressed in the shaker uniform, only remarkable for its severe simplicity and elaborate neatness. Both wore striped blue and white cotton gowns, with square muslin handkerchiefs pinned formally over the bosom, their hair combed back, and covered with muslin caps with straight borders, and white as the driven snow. Susan, the elder, was between forty and fifty years of age: she was tall and erect; and though rather slender in proportion to her height, well-formed. There was an expression of command in all her movements that seemed natural to her, and sate gracefully upon her. Her face had the same character of habitual independence and native dignity: the hues of youth had faded, but a connoisseur would have pronounced her at a single glance to have been handsome. Her features were large, and all finely formed; her eye, there, where the “spirit has its throne of light,” beamed with intelligence and tenderness. It was softened by a rich dark eye-lash, and of that equivocal hue, between gray and hazel, which seems best adapted to show every change of feeling; but vain is this description of colour and shape. It was the expression of strong and rebuked passions, of tender and repressed affections, of disciplined serenity, and a soft melancholy, that seemed like the shadow of past sufferings, which altogether constituted the power and interest of her remarkable face. The younger female was short and slightly formed. Her features were small; her blue eyes, light hair, and fair complexion, would have rendered her face insipid but that it was rescued by an expression of purity and innocence, and a certain appealing tender look, that suited well her quiet and amiable character. As they entered, Ellen threw her arms around the younger sister, exclaiming in a tone of the tenderest concern, “dear Emily, why did you not come sooner?” Emily trembled like an aspen leaf, and her heart beat as if it would have leapt from her bosom, but she made no reply. The elder sister grasped Ellen's hand, “Is it even so?” she said: she rightly interpreted Ellen's silence and sadness: “I foresaw,” she continued, “that our coming would be worse than in vain:” then turning to her young companion, she said, “put thy hand on thy mouth, and be still, my child. The mighty One hath done it, strive not against Him, for he giveth not account of any of his matters.” A loud groan was heard in the apartment of the dead. Susan Allen started, and exclaimed, “is my mother here? then, mother Anne be with me!” She paused for a moment, and added in a calm tone, “fear not, Emily, my child, in your weakness strength shall be made perfect; we shall not be left without the testimony.” Her words were quick, and her voice raised, as if she felt that she was contending against rebellious nature. She entered the room with a slow and firm step. Emily followed her, but it seemed not without faltering, G 3 for Ellen had passed her arm around her, and appeared to sustain half her weight. Her face was as pale as marble, and as still. “Pray speak to them, Mrs. Allen,” whispered Ellen: “yes, speak to them,” said Debby, in a voice of authority; “what signifies it! they are your own children, and there is no denying it.” “They were my children, but they have gone out from me, and are not of me,” replied the old woman, in a voice scarcely audible. “I am alone; they are uprooted; I am as an old oak, whose leaf has withered; judgment has come out against me.” “She is going clean distracted,” whispered Debby to Ellen, “you can do any thing with her; make her hear to reason while she has any left, and get her to go out of the room with you.” “No no,” said the old woman, who had over-heard Debby's whisper, “have no fear for me, my spirits are a little fluttered, and my soul is in travail for these wanderers, to get them back to my rest, and under my wing; but the Lord's own peace is in my heart and none can trouble that. Oh,” she continued, bursting into tears, as she turned her eyes from Emily to fix them on Susan, “was it not enough that you were led captive by Satan, enough for you to put on his livery, but you must tempt this child to follow you in your idolatries?” Strong sensibility is perhaps never extinguished; but Susan's was so subdued that, obedient to the motion of her will, it had soon returned to flow in its customary channels. She replied to her mother's appeal in her usual deliberate manner. “The child is not my captive, mother she has obeyed the gospel,” and, added she, looking at Emily with affectionate complacency, “she has already travelled very far out of an evil nature, and the believers are looking to see her stand in the foremost light, so clear is the testimony of her life against all sin.” Susan had an habitual influence over Emily; she felt that she commanded the springs that governed the mind of her timid disciple. Emily felt it too, and was glad to be saved from the efforts of self-dependence. She approached Susan, who had seated herself by the bed-side, when her grandmother took her by the hand, and drawing her towards her, she said in a voice scarcely audible—for sorrow, infirmity and despair almost deprived her of utterance—“Oh, Emily my child, my only child has she bewitched you?” She drew the unresisting girl towards the body of her brother,—“there, look on him, Emily, though dead, he yet speaketh to you, and if nature is not quite dead in you, you will hear him, he calls to you to break to pieces your idols, and to come out from the abominations of the land whither ye have been carried away captive.” Emily sighed heavily and wept, but said nothing. Susan moved to the other side of her, and seeming to lose the spirit of controvesy in some gentle remembrance, she said, “Edward was a good youth, and lived up to the light he had. There is one point where all roads meet; one thing certain, mother,” she added, an intelligent smile brightening her fine face, “we shall all be judged according to the light we have: some have a small, and some a great privilege.” “She has hit the nail on the head for once,” whispered Debby to Ellen: “and now Ellen, before they get into another snarl, do separate them.” Ellen's heart was full; she felt for all the parties a very tender, and an almost equal interest; and though she would have rejoiced in Emily's renunciation of her errors, she did not probably regard the sincere adoption of them with the terror and despair which the grandmother felt. “My dear friends,” she said, gently taking the hands of the mother and daughter, and joining them, “there is that in the face of your good Edward that bears an admonition to all our hearts, and teaches us all to remember how often we are commanded to love one another, and to be at peace one with another. It was the beloved apostle who said, `He that doeth good is of God:' may not then those who try to do his will, leave the rest to his mercy.” There was the eagerness and the authority of truth and goodness in Ellen's voice, and manner, and words; the spirit of love and of reconciliation; and the troubled waters would have been laid at rest, for the raised eye of the old lady showed that true devotion was working at her heart; and Susan looked on her acquiescingly and approvingly; and Emily's face shone with an expression of gratitude that her lips could not utter: but at this moment the outer door again opened, and Reuben Harrington, that one of “the brethren,” whom Debby had characterized as the “master-devil,” entered. He seemed to have arrived at that age, which the poet has characterized as the period of self-indulgence; and certainly he bore no marks of having disobeyed the instincts of nature by any mortifications of the flesh. He was of a middling stature, inclining to corpulency; with a sanguine complexion, a low forehead deeply shaded with bushy black hair, that absolutely refused to conform to the sleekness of his order; a keen gray eye, which had a peculiarly cunning expression from a trick he had early acquired, and of which he could never rid himself, of tipping a knowing wink; a short thick nose turning upward; a wide mouth, with the corners sanctimoniously drawn down, and a prominent fat chin following the direction of his nose. In short, he presented a combination and a form to awaken the suspicions of the most credulous, and confirm the strongest prejudices against a fraternity that would advance such a brother to its highest honours—or, to use their own phrase, to the dead. Reuben advanced to the bedside quite unceremoniously, and seemed to survey the dead and the living with as much indifference as if he did not belong to their species. No one spoke to him, nor did he speak, till his attention was arrested by poor Anne, who had shrunk away from the side of the bed, and sat on a low chair at its foot enveloped in her shawl, and sobbing aloud, apparently unconscious that any one saw or heard her. “Who is that young woman,” inquired Harrington of Debby, “that is making such an unseemly ado, is she kin to the youth?” “No!” uttered in her harshest voice, was all the reply Debby vouchsafed. “Some tie of a carnal nature, ha?” pursued Harrington. “No such thing,” said Debby, “Eddy was her sweetheart.” “Yea, yea, that is just what I meant, woman. Well,” he continued, with a long drawn gutteral groan, “the children of this world must bake as they have brewed; they are in the transgression, and they must drink the bitter draught their own folly has mixed.” After this consolatory harangue, he turned from the bedside, and began not humming, but shouting with the utmost power of his voice, a shaker tune, at all times sufficiently dissonant, and that now in this apartment of death and sorrow sounded like the howl of an infernal: to this music he shuffled and whirled in the manner which his sect call dancing and labour worship. “Stop your dumb pow-wow!” cried Debby, seizing him by the arm with a force that might have made a stouter heart than Reuben's rejoice in the protection of the convenient principle of non-resistance. “Nay, ye world's woman, let me alone,” said he, extricating himself from her grasp, and composing his neck-cloth, which Deborah's rough handling had somewhat ruffled; “know me for a peaceable man, that wars not with earthly powers.” “True,” replied Debby, “your war is with heavenly powers; but while the Lord is pleased to spare the strength of my right arm, I'll keep you peaceable. Peaceable! indeed, one would have thought all bedlam had been let loose on us—peaceable! your yells almost sacred the old lady's soul out of her body.” Poor Mrs. Allen, to whom Reuben's singing had sounded like a shout of victory from the infernal host, now really seemed in danger of such a catastrophe. She could scarcely raise her heavy eyelids, and the low moaning sounds that escaped her betrayed the infirmity of age, and the grief that words cannot express. Ellen renewed her entreaties that she would retire to her own room. No longer capable of resistance, she silently acquiesced, and Ellen conducted her to her bed, and watched over her, till she perceived that her wearied nature had sunk to repose. She then left her, and was softly closing the door, when she met Debby in the passage. “Now child,” said Deborah, “it is time that for once you should think a little of yourself; go to bed and take a good nap; there is no occasion for your going back to that room; it is quiet enough there now: poor little Ann stole away when nobody saw her, and I got the old man out, and gave him some victuals, and he is making a hearty meal.” “Where are Susan and Emily?” inquired Ellen “they must need rest more than I do.” “Yes, poor souls, they need it enough, but they will not take it; they are only waiting for Reuben to go away again.” “Away—before the funeral?” “Yes, and I think Susan has the right of it: she says `the dead need them not, and they are no comfort to the living.' And, to tell you the truth,” she added, in a lower tone, “I suspect she is now afraid to trust Emily here any longer. You know she and our James always had a notion for each other, and I guess Susan has found it out too; for though she is not much used to the world, she is a cute woman by natur', and sees as far into a millstone, as a'most any body. I marked her looking at Emily when James came into the room, for you must know he came in just after you went out, and Emily's face that was as white as curds before, turned red to the very roots of her hair; and when James offered her his hand, she did not take it to be sure, for that is quite contrary to all shaker rules and regulations; but she did not look the least affronted.” “I cannot think,” said Ellen, shaking her head doubtfully, “that Emily has any attachment to James. If she had, why did she join the shakers?” “Why! ah, that's more than I can tell. It passes the skill of a rational creature to give the whys and the wherefores of the motions of you young girls. I would as soon undertake to give a reason for the shiftings of the wind. But I am as sure that Emily Allen would rather stay with James, than to go back to the shakers, as that I know a southerly breeze from a northwester.” “But, Miss Deborah,” asked Ellen, apparently still incredulous, “was there any thing said that would warrant your conclusion?” “Yes, a good deal was said, but very low, and I scarcely heard any thing. But I did, however, hear James say, `Oh, Emily, how can you bear to think of all poor Edward felt for you, and of your old grandmother, for it will certainly kill her, and go back again to those people?' mind you he did not say a word about himself, but he looked enough, and I am sure Emily understood him, for girls are quick enough at taking such ideas, and I saw the tears gush from her eyes; and she said, `it is a great cross, James, but I must bear it.' Susan saw as much as I did, for she seemed as uneasy as a bird when a boy is robbing her nest. And she got up and told Emily in her calm way, to go with her to the kitchen fire. And Emily followed her, and she will follow her home, though with a heavy heart in her bosom.” `, But,” said Ellen, “Emily shall not go against her inclination.” “Ah there is the rub,” replied Debby. “Susan has that in her that she can make people a mind to do what they would hate to do for anybody else. I don't know what it is, she is not a stern woman, but it is a kind of nat'ral authority, as if she was a born-queen.” “She is very good, certainly,” said Ellen as if trying to discover the secret of Susan's power. “There it is,” replied Debby, “there is no getting such a grapple upon young folks' hearts, without goodness. But come, Ellen, there is no use in our standing here paraphrasing the matter, do you go to bed and I'll wait till this old vulture has done eating, and see them off, and then go back to the traveller's room; the laudanum has put him to sleep at last, and that is the best thing for him.” Ellen assured Deborah, that she would comply with her wishes, after having made one effort to detain Emily. Deborah commended her zeal, but was quite hopeless of success. Ellen said, that if she could not persuade her to remain with them now, she might suggest some considerations that might weigh with her afterwards. Debby thought “that looked rational; but there was no calculating with certainty upon such a feeble piece; if Emily's head had been as strong as her heart, she would never have been led away by such fooleries.” Sanguine hope is the privilege of the young; and Ellen began her expostulations with her ardour unimpaired by Debby's suggestions. She appealed to Emily's reason, and to her feelings for a long time, without producing any sensible effect. Both Susan and Emily sate in a fixed posture, with their eyes rivetted on the floor. At last the poor girl, unable any longer to smother the voice of nature, sobbed out, “what shall I do? what ought I to do?” “Resist to the death,” exclaimed Susan, in a voice of authority. “It is a strong temptation, child, but there is a way of escape. Come, Reuben,” she added, turning to Harrington, “we cannot tarry here in safety any longer.” “I am ready to depart,” he replied, for my deeaying nature is greatly refreshed by this carnal food. I feared before I took it, that, as the angel said to the prophet Elijah, my journey had been too great for me.” “That is a small matter,” said Susan; and then added in a lower tone, “Reuben, the child's soul is at stake:” and she followed him to the door, apparently to hasten his preparations. Ellen availed herself of this moment to ask Emily, at the same time placing her hand on the latch of the door that led into the apartment of the deceased, “if she would not once more look upon her brother?” “Oh, yes,” said she, and for the first time instinctively obeying the impulse of her feelings, she darted through the door: Ellen closed it after her without VOL. I. H following; believing that at this moment, it was best to leave her to the unassisted workings of her natural affections. But Susan, as soon as she returned from laying her injunctions on Reuben's reading what Ellen most wished, went to the door, and said as calmly as she was able, for her fears were increased by seeing James Lenox standing beside Emily, and eagerly addressing her, “Come, my child, we wait for you, be not like a silly dove without heart; take up your cross again, a full cross though it may be, and turn your back upon the world.” Emily, after a short struggle, obeyed, but with evident reluctance. It was manifest that the cords which bound her were relaxed, though not broken. Young Lenox followed her to the door, and unobserved even by Susan's watchful eye, he thrust a paper into her hand, which, without examining or offering to return it, she slipped into her bosom. A person of ordinary sagacity might have predicted, that from this moment the charm of the eldest sister's power was dissolved, and that though accident and habit, and the natural submission of weakness, intellectual or physical, to power, might detain the youthful disciple in thraldom, it would no longer be the service of a willing heart. Emily took an affectionate leave of Ellen; and Susan, after having simply said, “Farewell,” turned and added, “you meant well, Ellen — I know you meant well; but you have the voice of a charmer, and how should I be justified if I suffered this young child to be seduced from her obedience to the gospel?” “Promise me, at least,” said Ellen, “that you will not constrain Emily to remain among you; promise me that you will suffer her to see and hear from her friends.” “Ellen,” replied Susan, in a tone of solemnity bordering on displeasure, “we have neither dungeons, bolts, nor H 2 chains. We care not for the poor service of the perishing body; but we would bring all into the obedience of the spirit; and,” she concluded, looking at Emily with tearful eyes, “we would keep them there, if watching and praying can keep them: we have no other means.” “You promise then, what I ask?” “I tell you, Ellen,” she replied, “I need not promise. Emily is as free as I am—as you are.” “God grant that she may be,” said Ellen, in a suppressed voice; and perceiving that she could gain nothing farther from the impracticable enthusiast, she relinquished her hand, which in her eagerness she had taken, and once more bidding farewell, they parted. The waggon drove away, and Ellen went to her own apartment, of which she would have been glad now to have been the sole tenant. She had been too much disturbed by the suffering of those she loved, to be able to compose herself to sleep; and she sate down by an eastern window, to ponder on the various feelings of the heterogeneous group of mourners that Edward's death had brought together. “Oh,” thought she, as she gazed at the fair stars in their “quiet and orderly courses,” and then at the clear still lake in whose depths their beautiful images seemed to sleep: “why is it that all nature above us, and around is harmony, while we are left to such conflicts. The material world is performing the will of its Creator; the glorious sun is ever on its way, shining on the just and the unjust; the obedient planets roll on in their appointed paths; the clouds distil their nourishing waters, and the winds are his messengers as they pass, stirring the leaves, and waving the ripening harvest.” Ellen's reflections might have led her to a solution of the mystery, satisfactory to herself at least, but their chain was broken by an exclamation from Miss Redwood, who waking suddenly, exclaimed, “good heavens, Miss what's your name, are you up already? do be good enough to go to bed again —I can never sleep when any one is hazing about my room; and close the blind if you please, the light disturbs me.” Ellen smiled, but not thinking it important to explain the cause of her being up at an hour that Miss Redwood deemed so unseasonable, she let fall a neatly woven rush curtain, which sufficiently excluded the intrusion of the approaching day; and, laying herself on her bed, she was soon in a sleep that Miss Redwood might have envied.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI. “Thus Aristippus mourned his noble race, Annihilated by a double blow, Nor son could hope, nor daughter more t'embrace, And all Cyrene saddened at his wo.” Cowper. Doctor Bristol called on his patient the succeeding day; he found him feverish, and petulant in spite of his habitual politeness; he complained that the opiate had not been powerful enough. He anticipated a long delay; he was used to disappointment, and for himself could bear it; but he dreaded to encounter his daughter's impatience. Doctor Bristol understood too well the arts of his vocation, he was too sagacious a practitioner, not to have observed that a skilful application to the mind is often a surer remedy than any favourite or fashionable drug. He accounted satisfactorily to Mr. Redwood for the increase of fever; he detected and brought to light many favourable symptoms; spoke of a ball which was to be given in the village, and intimated that some of the most respectable inhabitants would wait on Miss Redwood, and deem themselves honoured by her presence. He produced some late newspapers which he had procured at the post-office; the last foreign reviews; and succeeded in producing as sudden a change of symptoms as an empiric would have promised. Mr. Redwood described the extraordinary scene he had witnessed during the night; asked many questions, and with particular interest in relation to the young lady whose face and demeanour had impressed him as belonging to an elevated sphere. Doctor Bristol assured him, that his sagacity was not at fault, for Miss Bruce (the young lady in question) was not a member of the Lenox family, but a stranger at Eton, and a friend of the Allens. Mr. Redwood said that the various modes of religious superstition always interested him; he was amused with seeing how willing man was to be the dupe of his own inventions; and intimating, that in the eye of experience and enlightened observation, all the forms of religious faith were equally absurd; shackles which men imposed, or wore, from tyranny or imbecility, he concluded by insinuating a compliment upon the free-thinking which was so common among the enlightened of the doctor's profession. Doctor Bristol, without assuming the attitude of combat, or seeming entirely to comprehend the drift of Mr. Redwood's remarks, observed, that there were, in his fraternity, some distinguished exceptions to the charge which had been laid against them. Every one acknowledged the authority of Boerhaave's H 3 name, “and our own Rush,” he said, (speaking with honourable pride of his master,) “is among the most humane and enlightened of philosophers, and the most humble of Christians.” Mr Redwood perceived that he had not proceeded with his usual tact; that he had presumed too far upon what he considered the necessary result of Doctor Bristol's general intelligence. He avoided any farther remarks which might have a tendency to disclose his own sentiments, and confined himself to comments on the persons he had observed the preceding night. He said he hardly knew whether the opinions of those people seemed to him most ridiculous or shocking. “Truly, he knew not which most to pity; the poor old woman who fancied a silly girl must lose all chance of salvation, because forsooth, she had forsaken the world, and in good faith joined a gloomy and self-denying order; or her child, the shaking quaker who had immolated every right and natural affection to an imaginary duty; who had forsaken all that made life a blessing, to follow an ignorant fanatic, or an impudent impostor.” The doctor acknowledged that such mistakes were lamentable; the result of limited knowledge, or accidental prejudices. Still, he thought, that while we lamented the errors to which we were liable, we might rejoice that the light we enjoyed was light from heaven, though its clearness must depend somewhat on the purity of the atmosphere into which it was introduced; the mists of ignorance might dim, but did not extinguish its pure ray. If an immortal hope led these people to some unnecessary sacrifices, it stimulated them to those that were necessary; for he believed there was no variety of the Christian faith, however distorted from the perfection of the original model, which did not insist on a pure morality. The doctor invited Mr. Redwood to observe the state of things about him; the wise and excellent institutions which had sprung from the religion of the pilgrims; the intelligence and morality that pervaded the mass of the people, which might be said to emanate from the principle of equality, derived from the Christian code. He spoke of the religious zeal and active benevolence which pervades our society, which, not neglecting the means of moral regeneration at home, sends its missionaries to the fearful climate of the east; to the barbarians of the south, and to the savages of our own dangerous wilderness. These noble efforts were not, as in older countries, supported by the pious zeal of a few of the bountiful, or the gifts of the penitent rich, who by a kind of spiritual commutation, expected to purchase, by their brilliant charities, the remission of their sins, but, for the most part, they were the fruit of the virtuous self-denials and exertions of the laborious classes of the community. Mr. Redwood listened with more patience than could have been expected from one who had philosophic prejudices; more inveterate perhaps than those which spring from the conceit of ignorance, because they are fortified by the pride of knowledge, and assume the form of independent opinions which is so flattering to our self-love. There was something too in doctor Bristol's manner that recommended every sentiment he uttered; it was so calm, so dispassionate, there was so much of the serenity of truth in it. There was no extravagant statements; he did not insist that another should believe, because he felt the truth of such and such propositions; he did not enter ino a formal argument, but intimated the grounds on which his own opinions had been formed, and permitted Mr. Redwood to draw his own conclusions, hoping they would be such, as seemed to him natural and inevitable. Mr. Redwood made minute inquiries in relation to the Lenox family. He expressed his surprise and regret, that they had not thought proper to interfere and detain by force, if necessary, the foolish little girl, who he predicted would soon be sick of her folly. He was pleased to hear that the doctor, as well as himself, regarded Deborah as an amusing original; and he again intimated some curiosity in relation to Miss Bruce, which the doctor either could not, or did not choose to gratify. He did not allow the doctor to leave him till he had requested him to make his visits as long and as frequent as possible, nor till he had expressed in the most flattering terms, his entire confidence in the doctor's professional ability. Miss Redwood entered her father's room as doctor Bristol left it, to make her dutiful enquiries which were perhaps nearly as much a matter of form as the professional visit of the physician. After she had gone through the customary routine of, “how he had slept? how he felt himself,” &amp;c. she said, “if you have no objections, papa, I will take a drive this afternoon to the village while this funeral is going on here. Ralph tells me, the injury done to the carriage yesterday was very slight, and that he can have it in order by one o'clock, the hour appointed for the funeral.” “If that is the case, my dear,” replied Mr. Redwood, “you will gratify me if you will forego your ride, and offer the carriage for the use of the poor old woman and her young friend: they have not probably as covenient a mode of riding, and I am told it is customary in New-England for the female relatives to follow the body to the grave.” “How barbarous!” exclaimed Miss Redwood; “but thank fortune there is no occasion, for Lilly tells me, the old woman is too sick to go out, and is just to sit up and hear the sermon and all that; and so, papa, if you have no objections I will take the carriage, and get out of the way: funerals and all that sort of thing, are so dull and disagreeable; I don't see the use of them.” The poet's doctrine, that “sweet are the uses of adversity,” was nearly as foreign from the father's as the daughter's experience: but he perceived that the good-will of the Lenox family would be of very material use to them; and thinking that it might be conciliated by the deference to their feelings which would be evinced by Miss Redwood's presence at the funeral solemnity, he requested her to gratify him by deferring her own inclinations. The request had too much authority in it to be denied; and though Miss Redwood thought it great folly to take the trouble to win favour which might be purchased, she did not in the end regret that she had complied with her father's request, so much was she amused with the number and aspect of the crowd which the occasion assembled. The observances of a funeral in a country town in New-England are quite primitive; but their simplicity is more touching than the most pompous ceremonial, for it speaks the language of nature to natural and universal feelings; and even to those who are not of that soft mould that is easily impressed by human sympathies, and who have only witnessed this last scene in the drama of life in a city, the spectacle of a country funeral must always be curious. In town, a funeral procession scarcely attracts the eye of the boy who is carelessly trundling his hoop, or flying his kite, and the busy and the gay bustle past, as if they cared for none of these things, and had neither part nor lot in them. But in the country, where life is not so plentiful; where each knows his neighbour, the events of his life, and the hope he may have had in death; the full import and terrible significance of this event is felt. Some will attend a funeral, because they remember a kind word or deed of the departed, or, it may be, a kind look that inspired a personal interest; some, from respect to the living; some because it is good to go to the house of mourning: the old would not shrink from the admonition they hear there, and the old take the young because they ought not to shrink from it: some like to watch the tears of the mourners, and some to note there are no tears. The motives that draw any crowd together are almost as various as the persons that compose it. On this occasion, there was an universal sentiment of compassion for the solitary aged mourner, and of respect for the memory of the departed. Miss Redwood took her statian at one extremity of the apartment in which the assembly met. She was arrayed with studied elegance; Lilly stood on one side of her chair and a footman in livery on the other: the body of the deceased was on the opposite side of the room: next to it sate Mrs. Allen, and beside her, and supporting her, Ellen, who, in a simple white dress, her face beaming with tender sympathy, looked like the embodied spirit of religion. Perhaps beauty is never more touching than when exclusively occupied with the sufferings of others, it is lit up with that divine expression of tender compassion, which, to a religious imagination, is the peculiar attribute of an angel's face. Next Ellen sate Mr. and Mrs. Lenox and their numerous family, all clad in mourning; their sad looks suiting well with their badges of grief. The two youngest children were placed on a bench at their parent's feet, and whenever they could withdraw their eyes from the various objects that attracted them, they would peep into their parent's faces, and catching the expressive language of sorrow, fall to crying, till some new object diverted their attention. Miss Deborah, having no part of her own to perform, acted as mistress of ceremonies. She spoke, perhaps, oftener and louder than was necessary, but on the whole, she conducted her affairs with less official bustle than is common on such occasions. After having made a clear space for the clergyman in the centre of the room, and assigned to others their places, allotting the arrangement of the procession to a gigantic militia Major, who usually filled that office, she seated herself at the foot of the coffin, permitted a large gray cat that came purring through the crowd to take its usual station in her lap, composed her muscles to a rigid attention, and motioned to the clergyman to begin his duty. He made an affecting exhortation, founded on the 15th chapter of the Epistle to the Corinthians. A funeral hymn was sung, and he then proceeded to close the services with a prayer, not however until Deborah had whispered to him, “the old lady is just spent, be short, Sir: pray but a breath or two.” The aged mourner had listened without once raising her eyes, without a sigh or a movement. It seemed as if time or grief had dried the fountain of her tears, for not one was seen on her furrowed cheek. The services over, the Major ordered the crowd to fall back to the right and left, while the coffin was carried out. His order was obeyed, (though with somewhat less of military precision than it was given,) and the coffin was placed in the court-yard under the wide spreading branches of an elm tree. He then returned to the door, and in the tone of military command, desired the mourners to advance and look at the corpse, and added a notice to the assembly to come forward immediately after the mourners had retired, it being necessary that all should take their last looks now, as the lid of the coffin was to be screwed down before the procession moved: a burst of grief from the group of mourners evinced that these commands, given out as the mere forms of preparation, were to them the dreadful signal of a final separation. Mrs. Allen rose from her chair, but even with Ellen's aid was unable to move forward till doctor Bristol, advancing from the crowd, gave her the support of his stronger arm. She then approached the coffin, and bent for the last time over the body of her child; her tears, which had been checked till this moment, now flowed freely; and as she raised her head, she perceived they had fallen on Edward's face; she said nothing, but carefully wiped them away. “She is right,” whispered Doctor Bristol to Ellen. “Edward has nothing more to do with tears: they are all wiped away.” “Oh, my son,” exclaimed Mrs. Allen, in a low broken voice, “would to God Emily laid beside you; then would I thankfully lay down my weary body with you. But,” she added, after a moment's pause, in which her piety struggled with her nature, “God's will be done.” “Glad am I to hear those words,” said Debby, who stood near enough to catch the feeble sounds: “the poor old lady's cup has been brimful of trouble so long that it would not be strange if she did think herself something crowded on.” “Crowded on—what can the woman mean?” asked a young man of his companion; but before the inquirer could obtain a reply, he was jostled out of his place by others eagerly pressing forward to gaze for the last time on the face of the deceased. All as they turned away looked on Mrs. Allen, and some perhaps wondered that the leafless scaithed trunk should have been passed by, and the young sapling cut down in its prime and beauty. Mrs. Allen was led back to the house, attended by Ellen and doctor Bristol; they passed through the apartment where Miss Redwood still maintained her station, and where she continued to gaze upon all that passed before her with the indifference with which she would have regarded the shifting scenes of a wearisome play: the Major approached her, and with awkward but well-meant civility, told her she would have a good chance now to look at the corpse, and, being she was a stranger, he would see her through the crowd himself “Oh thank you,” she replied disdainfully, “I have no fancy for looking at dead people, and certainly I shall not look at one dead that I never saw living.” The Major, thus rebuffed, turned away, and meeting Debby, he said in a low tone, “I rather think that young stranger girl has got to find out yet that she is mortal.” “Why, bless my soul! a body would think her road did not lay grave-ward; but young, and handsome, and topping as she is, she must come to it at last.” “She is a pretty creature though to look at,” he added, paying her the tribute of another full stare; “she is almost as handsome as the wax-work Rode-Island beauty.” “Pooh, pooh,” replied Debby, “handsome is that handsome does,” and she glanced her eyes towards Ellen Bruce; that is my rule, it is an old one, but it will never wear out.” “Miss Debby is right,” whispered a pert girl, with the insolence of youth; “quite right to stick to every thing that is old.” “Yes, yes,” replied Debby, who unluckily overheard her, “quite right, till there is more reason to hope that the rising generation will make good the places of those who have gone before them.” A call was now given to form the VOL. I. 1 procession. Mrs. Allen was conducted by her kind attendants to her own apartment. The rooms were cleared, the procession moved away, and the house was restored to its usual quiet and order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII. “What folly I commit I dedicate to you.” Two Gentlemen of Ferona. The week that followed the funeral would have been passed by Miss Redwood in perfect listlessness, had not Miss Bruce excited her curiosity, and her curiosity been stimulated by the difficulty of its gratification. The following petulant production of her pen, a letter achieved to her grandmother after repeated and painful efforts, may afford a fair view of her feelings. It certainly is not a favourable specimen of her talents, for she had originally a strongly marked character: but abandoned from her infancy to the guidance of a doting and I 2 silly grandmother, and early initiated into fashionable and frivolous society, with uncommon intellectual capacities and strong passions, she was permitted to devote herself to every thing that was trifling, and, in short, condemned to a perpetual childhood. But no farther remarks shall be intruded on the just inferences which the good sense of our readers will enable them to deduce from the document itself. “My dear grandmamma,—I can fancy your vexation when you receive this letter; for you, and you alone, can form an adequate notion of my disappointments and present misery. As to papa, you know he never feels, nor thinks as you and I do. “No doubt in your imagination I am figuring in the drawing-rooms of Boston, displaying those beautiful dresses you imported for this ill-starred journey; leading captive my thousands and my tens of thousands; living in an atmosphere of lover's sighs, and on the eve of breaking a hundred hearts by my departure for the Springs, where we expected that a second harvest of conquest and glory awaited me. `Now look on that picture, and on this.' Here I am at a vulgar farmer's, on the outskirts of a town called Eton; and so changed am I, or rather every thing about me is so changed, that I can scarcely believe that not much more than one little month has elapsed since I was parading Broadway with Captain Fenwick—(by the way, Broadway is a sublime place for a real show off,)—and he said to me, as admirer after admirer poured into my train, `you see Miss Redwood, that you are the centre of the system,—the sun; and we, your satellites, humbly revolve around you.' What would he think, what could he say, if he were to see me now; not a creature dazzled by my brightness, though there is not a rival star in the heavens?—but a truce to lamentations, I will proceed to facts, and then, dear grandmamma, you will perceive how much I deserve and need your pity. I must begin my relation at St. John's, where the only pleasant incident occurred which this letter will contain. You will remember that I wrote you from Montreal the particulars of my first interview with Captain Fitzgerald, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera: how many delightful gallantries and flattering speeches are included in these et ceteras! Speaking of Fitzgerald, carries me back to Montreal; and I must say, en passant, I was shockingly disappointed in the size and appearance of the city, which I expected to find as large as New-York; and still more with the military band; for you know, grandmamma, you always told me that since the revolution we had never had any military music fit to be heard. But to return to our journey. The first person I beheld on arriving at St. John's was Fitzgerald; he had come there, as he whispered to me, to see me once more. Papa was very cold—almost rude to him; but I took care that my pleasure should be sufficiently apparent to compensate him for papa's incivility. It is so strange of papa, when he knows that Fitzgerald is the son of an earl, and brother to a Lord; and if he is a little gay, as papa says he is, dissipation is universal among military men, and no fault of theirs of course. I don't see what good it does papa not to be religious, if he will make such a fuss about trifles. My dear grandmamma, you would admire Fitzgerald; and you may have an opportunity, for he assured me, that if he could get up a cough that would furnish a pretext to ask leave of absence, he would pass the next winter at Charleston. He hinted at the possibility of meeting me at the Springs. I am ready to die with vexation when I think of what I may lose by our detention in this vile place. It is but little more than a week, though it seems to me an age, since we met with the shocking accident which has caused our delay. Immediately on getting into our own carriage, (the sight of which was the first thing that revived me after parting with Fitzgerald,) we were overtaken by a tremendous thunder-storm, which of course almost deprived me of my senses; the lightning struck a number of trees, and the prodigious blaze that ensued, so terrified the horses, that they leaped over a precipice forty or fifty feet high. Fortunately the carriage was not turned over, owing, I believe, though I never understood clearly how it was, to its being caught among the branches of the trees. I was wild with fright, and poor Lilly as white as my handkerchief. As soon as we were extricated from our perilous situation, we took refuge in the nearest farm-house, glad, at the moment, of any shelter from the storm. We should have proceeded the same evening to the village, but papa had his arm horribly broken in jumping from the carriage, and here we were obliged to remain; and here we have a prospect of passing the remainder of papa's life; for strange to tell, he has put himself into the hands of a country doctor; and what is worse, though he never believed in anything before, he has taken a freak to place implicit confidence in this man, whose interest it is, you know, to detain him here as long as possible. This papa does not seem to suspect, clair-voyant, as he prides himself on being, and aided too by the light of my hints, which you may be sure I have not spared. What is most extraordinary and provoking of all is, that papa, who was never contented before in his life, appears as satisfied as if he had entered elysium; and never before patient, has suddenly become as patient as Job. I 8 “There is one solution of the mystery which I hardly dare to commit to paper, lest some bird of the air should carry it to papa. “You must know, grandmamma, there is a young woman here—lady I suppose I must call her—for to confess the truth, she has every appearance of being one, that has inspired papa with the most surprising admiration from the first moment that he saw her. I dare not say he is in love with her: I will not think it. I should go mad if I believed it; but he has the most unaccountable interest in her. Yesterday I said to him with as much apparent carelessness as I could assume, `Lilly tells me that this Miss Bruce is shortly to be married.' “`Ah,' said he, starting from one of his fits of absence, `to whom? where did Lilly pick up this intelligence?' `From some of the family; the happy man is a son of our host's, a young parson.' `Impossible,' exclaimed papa. `Impossible, Sir,' I echoed, `why so?' The dear old gentleman was a little flustered for a moment, and then said, `Miss Bruce is so superior to this Lenox family, so intelligent and cultivated;'—`but, papa, you are always crying up these Lenoxes for such knowing people.' `They deserve our respect, Miss Redwood: they are excessively well-informed, and clever: but, Caroline, you must see the disparity between them and Miss Bruce; it is quite apparent: the gracefulness of her demeanor, the uncommon delicacy of her manners, the very tones of her voice, mark her as a being of the highest order.' It is a gone case, thought I; but hiding my thoughts in the depths of my heart, I replied, `she has undoubtedly a more genteel air than these Lenox girls; but why should she be on intimate terms with the family, if she has such superior pretensions?' `I know not,' he replied, pettishly; `there is some tie of benevolence to the Allens, I believe; but of course it is a subject which we cannot with any propriety investigate.' He then told me he was fatigued, and would like to be left alone; and as I came out of the room, he requested me to send Lilly to him. His reluctance to investigation was suddenly vanquished, for as I afterwards learned from Lilly, he questioned, and cross-questioned her as to the source and amount of her intelligence.—Heaven grant it may be true! “I cannot imagine how papa can feel any interest in this Lenox family: they are common working vulgar farmers. There is one oddity among them, whom they call an `old girl;' a hideous monster—a giantess: I suspect a descendant of the New-England witches; and, I verily believe, if the truth was known, she has spell-bound papa. The wretch is really quite fond of him; for him she wrings the necks of her fattest fowls, and I hear her at this moment bawling to one of the boys, to kill the black-eared pig,—for him no doubt. Notwithstanding her devotion to papa, she does not pay me the least respect, but lavishes all her favour on Ellen Bruce. I overheard her this morning saying to Mrs. Lenox, that Ellen was as much of a lady as that Caroliny gal, with all her flaunting ruffles and folderols. Ellen, she said, had been brought up to business; but as to that useless piece, she could neither act nor transact. She says too, that, rather than have a fellow-creter tag round after her, as Lilly does after me, she would turn wild Indian. “Only think, dear grandmamma, of my being obliged to hear such rude things said without notice or resentment, for papa is very angry if I betray, in the slightest degree, my contempt and detestation of these people and their ways; even if I ridicule them, he quotes to me a wise old saw of Cæsar's, or somebody's, that, `He that condemns rusticity is himself a rustic.' In heaven's name, of what use is rank or fortune, if it does not make you independent of such animals! “In every respect this place is disagreeable to me. It fatigues me to death to see the family labour: labour, as you often say, grandmamma, was made for slaves, and slaves for labour; but here they toil on as if it was a pleasure. They have an immense farm, as they call their plantation, and but two servants, (one a negro) or as they call them, helps; and well are they thus named, for they do no more work than the rest of the family; and what provokes me more than all, is, that these servants read and write, and are taught arithmetic, and the Lord knows what all, and Lilly and Ralph have this dreadful example before them. But the most ridiculous thing is, the fuss these people make about learning, as they call all sorts of knowledge; one would think it was the philosopher's stone, by the pains they take to get it. After the girls `have done up their work, and put every thing to rights,' (this is their jargon) they walk twice in a week, a mile and a half to the village to hear a man lecture on botany. I am sure you would expire with laughter, to see their boors of brothers come from their work in the fields laden with flowers for their sisters to analyse, or preserve in their herbariums. There is a village library, and as much eagerness for the dull histories and travels it contains, as you and I ever felt to get a new novel into our possession. As to novels, there is no such thing as obtaining one, unless it be some of Miss Edgeworth's, which scarcely deserve the name of novels. If I could but sleep as we used to in the country, and the country, as far as I can see was made for nothing else, I could contrive to get rid of some more of my time; but the air on the lake-shore is so bracing, that for my life I cannot sleep more than nine or ten hours. These people are excessively civil to papa; but they seem to think they have a right to place themselves on an equality with me, and the more haughty my manners, the less attention they pay to me. Papa reads me long lectures about availing myself of this opportunity of studying human nature, and observing the different conditions of human life. Is it not unreasonable to expect me to care about such things? and if I did, I should as soon think of taking Robinson Crusoe's desert island for a study as this place. All of human life that I ever wish to see is limited to the drawing-room, the ball-room, and the other haunts of the beau monde. I should certainly die of ennui, if it were not that this Ellen Bruce excites my curiosity to such a degree: who can she be? I suspect that she is a natural child of somebody's, for whenever I have asked any questions about her connexions, she is evidently troubled, and the people of the house affect to be quite ignorant of her parentage, and in reply to my inquiries, simply say, that she came from a distant part of the country: she is here with an old woman by the name of Allen, to whom she is devoted: she is an intimate friend of Mrs. Lenox, and not a relation of either; and to confess the truth, she is, as papa says, of an order quite superior to them. She is an orphan, and without fortune: so much the Lenoxes have condescended to tell me; without fortune, and yet her dress is of the finest materials; not exactly fashionable, as I said to papa: he replied, with some truth I must allow, `but a model for fashion, Caroline.' “One circumstance has excited my curiosity particularly: she rises every morning at the dawn of day, and sallies out, and does not return till the old woman is ready to rise, which is our breakfast hour, (papa's and mine;) and then papa, from great consideration for the trouble of the Lenoxes, begs Miss Bruce will do us the favour to sit at our table. On these occasions she departs from her customary pensive style, her complexion usually of the pale order, is quite brilliant, and her manner and conversation animated. Papa, very innocently, imputes all this to the benefit of morning exercise, and I as innocently on one occasion proposed to be her companion, an honour she politely declined without assigning any reason, though she has repeatedly offered to show me the pleasant walks in the neighbourhood. “She expresses the greatest impatience to have Mrs. Allen well enough to return to her own residence; but this I think is mere affectation; and in this guessing, calculating, concluding country, I have come to the conclusion, that if heaven does not speed the old woman's recovery, or the Lenox match, or some other insuperable obstacle, she and papa will get up a sentimental affair of it. A sentimental affair! papa fifty, and Miss Bruce nineteen or twenty: stranger things have happened—you remember my two old fools of lovers who were well nigh fifty; they, it is true, were neither sick nor dull like papa; but then Miss Bruce has neither fortune nor beauty; at least I am sure you would not call her beautiful who can she be, grandmamma? Papa says she has received a first-rate education; but that is according to his queer old-fashioned notions. She plays upon no instrument, and is not fond of dancing; of course you know she cannot dance well. As to French she does not speak it all, though papa says she is quite familiar with French and Italian authors, and she and papa talk over Racine and Ariosto and the Lord knows what all, at our interesting déjeuners, which I am resolved to break up as soon as I have ascertained the object of the long morning walks that precede them. Write to me, dear grandmamma, and direct to this place, and do not fail to let me know whether papa has the control of my fortune, so that if I should marry contrary to his wishes, he could deprive me of it: and pray ask Le Moine, whether the blue trimming was intended for the white or the brown dress; Lilly has forgotten, and I am quite at a loss about it. By the way, if poor Sarah should die as you expect before I return, don't mention it in your letters, for I want a good excuse for not putting on black—which would be horrible; as Maria Crayton says, there is not a mantua-maker in New-England that can make a dress fit for a Christian to wear, and besides you know one can have no variety in black. I cannot imagine where Miss Bruce has her dresses made; they are plain enough, but they sit exquisitely. Farewell, dear grandmamma, I shall give you the earliest notice of any discoveries I may make. “Postscript.—Thank heaven! papa has just given me leave to write to Mrs. Westall to come to Eton with Charles, so that I have a prospect of seeing two civilized beings, who will probably think me quite equal to this prodigy, Ellen Bruce: and I do not despair of finding a tolerable beau, pro tem. in Charles Westall; though I think he will scarcely drive Fitzgerald out of my head and heart.” As curiosity is in its nature infectious, our readers may possibly have caught Miss Redwood's desire to know something more of Ellen Bruce's history than has yet been disclosed to them, and to gratify this inclination, they may be willing to attend to a sketch of some other persons, with whose history hers is necessarily interwoven. Justyn Allen, the father of Emily and Edward, was born in Connecticut, whence while a minor he emigrated with his father's family to the state of New-York. There he and all the rest of the family, with the exception of his mother, were, for a short time, under the dominion of Ann Lee, the founder of the shaker society: by the charitable deemed an enthusiast—by those of severer judgment, an impostor. At her first appearance in this country, she made many converts from among the respectable class of farmers. Her dominion, however, over the Allen family, was of short duration, and after a few weeks of wild fanaticism, the father and children returned to the half-distracted mother, to lament or deride their delusion. Susan Allen, the youngest child, alone remained constant to her new faith, which she had been the last to adopt, and which had been endeared to her by difficult sacrifices. Justyn Allen as he was preparing, according to the uniform custom of our unportioned young farmers, to seek his fortunes in the west, received the intelligence of the death of a bachelor uncle who had resided within forty miles of Boston, in a beautiful village, which we shall take the liberty to call Lansdown. This uncle had bequeathed to Allen a valuable farm and all the appurtenances thereunto belonging. He hastened to take possession of it; and to complete his happiness he married a well-educated and exemplary young woman from his native state. Five years after their marriage, Mrs. Allen returned from a short visit to Connecticut, bringing with her an infant girl, the child, as she said, of a young friend of hers who had died within the first year of her marriage, and had bequeathed the child to her. There was no improbability in the story; and as no one in Lansdown knew Mrs. Allen's early connections, the busy questioning spirit of village curiosity was not excited to inquiry or suspicion. Mrs. Allen was a woman who walked straight forward in the direct line of duty—simple in her manners, and ingenuous in her conduct; there was nothing about her to invite curiosity. It was observed that she loved the child tenderly; but that was natural; for besides that she was a most lovely little creature, she came to Mrs. Allen before she had children of her own to occupy her maternal affections. From the time the child, who had received the name of Ellen, could comprehend anything, Mrs. Allen had been in the habit of talking to her of her mother. But in spite of her efforts it was always in a sad tone; and once the child interrupted her to ask, “was not my mother good?” “Yes, my love, perfectly good.” “Well, then, is she not glad to be in such a place as heaven?” “Yes, I believe so.” “You need not look so sorry then, when you are talking about her.” Mrs. Allen felt the propriety of the child's rebuke; but besides that it is always grievous to see a bud so early torn from its parent stock, there were bitter recollections associated with the memory of Ellen's mother, and especially with her death, that clouded Mrs. Allen's brow whenever she spoke of her. She did however, in compliance with the last injunction of the unfortunate mother, faithfully endeavour to inspire the child with a love for her—to make hope take the place of memory; and by constantly cherishing the expectation of a reunion to her mother, she preserved in its strength the filial bond. It is only when our human affections are consecrated by a belief in their perpetuity, that they can have their perfect influence on the character. VOL. I. K Ellen experienced the holy ministration of which they are capable from her earliest years. Before she reasoned, she felt a relation to heaven; her affections were set on things above. This shielded her innocence, and gave a tenderness and elevation to her character, as if the terrestrial had already put on the celestial. The natural gaiety of childhood, though sometimes intermitted, was not impaired. Her eyes, it is true, were tearful while she sate on her little bench at Mrs. Allen's feet, and listened to the stories of her mother; but the next moment she was playing with her kitten, or bounding away in pursuit of a butterfly—so natural is it for the opening flower to shrink from a chilling influence, and expand to the sun beams. Ellen had been told by Mrs. Allen that she had no father; and whenever the child's interest was excited about him, (which was not often, as Mrs. Allen studiously avoided all mention of him,) the answers to her inquiries were discreetly framed to lull her curiosity, without communicating the least information. The impression she received was that he had died at nearly the same time with her mother. Her childhood glided on to her fifth year, bright as a cloudless morning, when an event occurred that produced a great sensation in Lansdown, and materially affected the character and destiny of our heroine. There was an estate adjoining Allen's, which from time immemorial, (a period that in our young country may mean half a century) had belonged to the Harrisons, a family residing in Boston. It had the usual fate of the property of absentees—the house was out of repair, the fences in a ruinous condition, and the land from year to year depreciating from unfaithful husbandry. Allen had gone on in the usual way, buying more cattle to graze his land, K 2 and more land to feed his cattle, till smitten with a desire to enlarge his territory, (the ruling passion of our farmers, each one of whom is said to covet all the land adjoining his own,) he cast his longing eyes on the Harrison farm, and easily persuaded himself there were good reasons in the nature of things why it should be united to his own. Both farms lay at the distance of half a mile from the village. Allen's was on an eminence, and divided from the Harrison estate by a small stream, whose annual overflowing enriched the lowlands of his neighbour without reaching to the elevation of his; with every rain the cream of his soil trickled down to his neighbour's, and the droughts that seared his fields left his neighbour's smiling in their verdant prosperity. Still the hand of the diligent, busy on Allen's farm, amply compensated for this natural disparity; and when he realized the profits of his labour and thriftiness, his hankering after the facilities of the adjoining property increased to such a degree, that he sent to the proprietor a proposition for the purchase of it, by one of his townsmen, a member of the state legislature. Mr. Robert Harrison, the representative of his family, received the proposition with indignation, and failed not to express his surprise that any one should presume to think he would part with a family estate. The honourable member, who was one of the numerous Cincinatusses of our country, called from the plough to patriotic duties, felt his new-made honours touched by this reflection on one of his constituents, and he replied, as to `family estate, that was an old joke, that one family was as good as another now-a-days, and that for his part, he must say it was his humble opinion that no family could be any honour to an estate, and no estate to a family, when it was left in such a condition as the Harrison farm at Lansdown.' The member's humble opinion stung the family pride of Mr. Robert Harrison; and from that moment he meditated a removal to the neglected farm, which, in the pride of his heart, he loved to call the family estate. Many circumstances strengthened his resolution. At the breaking out of the revolutionary war, Robert Harrison had just attained his majority, and entered into the possession of a large fortune, with the expectation of succeeding to the honours of the provincial government, which his father had always enjoyed. Robert Harrison was allied to some noble families in the mother country, an important circumstance in the estimation of the untitled gentry of the colony. Possessing fortune, the favours of the government, and the distinctions of rank, and priding himself on the unstained loyalty of his ancestors, young Harrison naturally sided with the tory party. He had every thing to lose, and nothing to gain for himself from a change of government; and as to the rights of the people, which were the subject of contest, he held them in too great contempt to acknowledge they had any rights. Harrison, however blind he might be to the principle of natural justice, was soon obliged to feel that “might makes right,” and he, with many other staunch friends of the government, in danger of being swept away by the tide of republicanism, sought a shelter in the mother country. There he soon after married a young lady, a Bostonian by birth, who had been sent home, according to the fashion of the most wealthy gentry in the colony, for her education. Similarity of opinion and of fortunes had united Robert Harrison to her father's family, and governed more by the accidents of their condition, than by any congeniality of character, she married him. Mrs. Harrison, from the age of thirteen to nineteen, immured in a boarding-school, came forth from it as ignorant of the motley mass called the world, as if she had been bred in a convent. Happily, her education had been conducted by a superior woman, who, proud of her pupil's extraordinary powers, had added to the common routine of boarding-school accomplishments judicious intellectual cultivation: so that even at this period, when a well-informed woman is neither a monster nor a prodigy, Mrs. Harrison would have been distinguished for her mental attainments. The exact habits of her school had given a preciseness to her manners, that veiled the warmth of her feelings, but never was there a more generous and tender spirit than she possessed. Robert Harrison had a fine appearance and engaging manners; he was the object of her parent's partiality, and the first suitor for her favour: and viewing him through the prismatic medium of romantic expectation and youthful fancy, it was not strange that she loved, or believed she loved him. Perhaps she was not herself conscious of the capacity of her affections, till the energies of maternal love were awakened by the birth of a child. This child, a girl, lived but five years, and when she died, her mother resigned her as she would have done her own soul if it had been demanded, with unquestioning faith in the wisdom of the dispensation. But she never recovered her former spirits, though her mind, too active to remain the passive prey of grief, still pressed forward in the pursuit of some new attainment. She seemed to love knowledge for its own sake; her husband took no part nor interest in her pursuits, and as to the gratification of vanity in display, for that she had neither opportunity nor inclination. The family remained in England till the peace in 1783, when they returned K 3 to this country, with their English affections and prejudices strengthened by habit, and endeared by the privations they had suffered on account of their loyalty. Mr. Harrison claimed his patrimonial estate, and found, to his bitter disappointment, that those persons who had been designated by name in the act of confiscation were excepted in the repeal of that act, and it was not his least mortification in finding himself one of this unfortunate number, that his property had gone to the support of a cause which he detested. The estate at Lansdown,—his household furniture and plate, and some personal property, he saved from the wreck of his fortune. This was a small portion of his rich inheritance, but skilfully managed by the domestic talents of Mrs. Harrison, it was sufficient for the limited expenses of a small establishment. The meanness of his fallen fortunes did not at all degrade his rank in his native town, for if some portions of our country must sustain the reproach of paying undue deference to the vulgar aristocracy of wealth, that part of it has always been exempt from this common fault of a commercial country. Neither did his English feelings render him less acceptable in the society of Boston; the first to prove a rebel child, she never lost in her resistance of authority, her love for the parent land. But Mr. Harrison had not magnanimity of mind to enjoy the advantages that remained to him. He was perpetually harassed by seeing those who had been distinguished in their country's service, or diligent in the avenues of business which had been recently opened, arriving at wealth and honours which he looked upon as the exclusive right— the birthright of the higher orders. The higher orders had sunk to the uniform level of republicanism, to what Mr. Harrison was fond of calling, a church-yard equality; there even he was hardly willing the high and the low, the rich and the poor, should meet together. Not all the courtesies and kindness of a cultivated and virtuous society could compensate Mr. Harrison for the mortification of seeing the mansion-house of his family in the possession of one of the mushroom gentry—an appellation he freely bestowed on every name not noted under the provincial government, and entitled to no more credit or honour in his eyes, than a parchment deed without the crown stamp. The years rolled heavily on; Mrs. Harrison's parents had been gathered to their fathers, and independent in her pursuits, and active in her habits, her life passed without discontent or ennui. When her husband proposed their removal to Landsdown, she acquiesced willingly, in the hope that he would become interested in the little concerns of his farm, and forget the trifling vexations that in Boston disturbed his peace. Confirmed in his wishes by his wife, who exercised a discreet, and therefore an insensible influence over him, Mr. Harrison vested his property in an annuity in the British funds, and removed to Lansdown. This new arrangement of his pecuniary affairs afforded him a larger income than he had enjoyed for a long time, and enabled him to restore the place at Lansdown to its primitive order and dignity, The house was newly painted, the fences rebuilt, and the garden re-stocked with fruit trees and plants. Mrs. Harrison gently remonstrated against the removal of the antique and ponderous furniture, and even hazarded the profane suggestion that it would be wise to dispose of it at auction, and to procure that which would be more adapted to their present fortune, and in better keeping with the simplicity of country life, and which would neither expose them to the sneers nor envy of their neighbours. “Neighbours!” replied the irritated husband, “I wish you to understand once for all, Mrs. Harrison, that I mean to have no neighbours. The people of Lansdown remember the habits of the family too well to presume to associate with us. As to the furniture, I have made up my mind about that, and you know my mind, once made up, is not given to change; therefore, Mrs. Harrison, you will be so good as to order every article of our furniture, large and small, to be packed up with the greatest possible care.” Mrs. Harrison reserved all her opposition to her husband for matters that she deemed important; the furniture was packed and arranged at Lansdown with her best skill: and there Mr. Harrison surveyed, with infinite complacency, the turkey carpets, damask curtains and sofa, the cumbrous mahogany chairs, and family plate studiously arranged in an old fashioned buffet with glass doors, and the loyal garnishing of the walls decorated with approved likenesses of their majesties and their hopeful offspring, and with proof prints of the royal parks and palaces. Mrs. Harrison, though she could not but smile at this parade of the relics of their departed wealth and grandeur, took a benevolent pleasure in ministering to the gratification of her husband; and when she left him in the parlour still gazing on the memorials of patrimonial splendour, and retired to arrange in a small apartment adjoining her bed-room (in which were her books and drawing materials) some choice or favourite plants: `we must both,' she thought, `have our playthings. If you had lived, my sweet Mary,' she said, turning her eye on a beautiful picture of her child that hung at the foot of her bed, `we might have had some occupation that would have saved us from thus prolonging our childhood.' Her attention was attracted by the sound of a light footstep, and a beautiful little girl entered her apartment with a basket of fine early peaches, which she timidly offered to Mrs. Harrison, with Mrs. Allen's respects. Mrs. Harrison's mind was at this moment filled with the image of her child, and she saw, or fancied she saw, a striking resemblance between the portrait and the little stranger. She looked from one to the other; the eyes were of the same deep blue, there was the same peculiar, and, as she thought, heavenly grace of the mouth; the hair too, a light and bright brown, fell in the same natural curls over her neck and shoulders. “Oh, my own, dear Mary,” she exclaimed, as she placed the child on her lap, and gazed on her, “I can almost fancy you are again in my arms; and yet,” she added, as the tears gushed from her eyes, “she has not quite that look my Mary had.” Ellen Bruce, (for it was she) after looking in silent amazement for a few moments at Mrs. Harrison said, “I wish I was your Mary, and then you would not be so sorry.” “Sweet child,” exclaimed Mrs. Harrison, wiping away her tears, and smiling on her, “and who are you— who is your mother?” “Oh, I don't live with my mother, she lives in heaven, Mrs. Allen says.” “Who then do you live with, my love?” “I live with our little Emily's mother.” “And who is she?” “Why, Mrs. Allen; did not you know that she had little twin babies?” “No, my dear child; but if you will show me the way to Mrs. Allen's, I will go with you and see her:” so saying, she threw on her hat and shawl, and was descending the stairs with the little girl, when she met her husband in quest of her. “My dear,” said he snapping his fingers, and speaking in an unusually animated tone, “here is an English paper—and glorious news. The English have gained a complete victory: thank God! that cowardly rascal Bonaparte is beaten at last.” “I am glad of it,” replied Mrs. Harrison, turning from him to pursue her first intention. “Glad of it! Pshaw, is that all—what is the matter—where are you going? here are all the particulars; the number engaged, the names of the officers, a list of the killed, wounded, and prisoners: every thing most satisfactory; none of your lying French bulletins, but English—fair John Bull style; every word true—true as the gospel.” “I am very glad of it,” repeated Mrs. Harrison, “I will read it the moment I return from leading this little girl home; she has brought us some delicious peaches from one of our neighbours.” “Send one of the servants with her; I am impatient to hear you read these accounts; there are many private letters from the officers that were in the action, and besides,” he added, lowering his voice, “the people about us are quite too much inclined to familiarity already. I do not wish you to encourage them. Here Betsy,” he vociferated to the servant girl, “lead this child home.” Mrs. Harrison led Ellen to the door, and kissing, and begging her to come again to see her, she transferred her to the care of the servant, and returned to soothe her husband with all the interest she could command in the details of the victory. Ellen Bruce had received such various and confused impressions during her short visit to the mansion-house, that she was unable to give a clear report of it to Mrs. Allen: and as the child brought no word of acknowledgment for the peaches, Mrs. Allen naturally concluded that her first neighbourly overtures were unkindly taken: her husband completed her mortification by asking her, “how she could make such a mistake as to suppose that the duke (a title already bestowed on Mr. Harrison by his republican neighbours) could eat fruit that did not grow on the `family estate?”' Mrs. Allen, with all her good sense, was not quite free from the jealous pride that pervades her class in New-England: she resolved not to waste her courtesies upon those who disdained them; and when Ellen, calling to mind Mrs. Harrison's invitation to her, begged leave to carry her some more peaches, Mrs. Allen said, “no! if the peaches were worth sending, they were worth thanking for.” Ellen rather felt than understood the reply, and she answered, “but I am sure the lady spoke very kind to me.” “Ay, yes my dear, that is an easy matter, every body speaks kind to you; it is not necessary to force you upon any one's notice: when Mrs. Harrison sends for you it will be time enough for you to go to her.” Ellen had no purpose of disobedience, but surprised at the unwonted strictness of Mrs. Allen, she determined to lay aside all the peaches that were given to her for the lady whose kind manner to her had made a deep impression. In the meantime, Mrs. Harrison possessed herself of all that was known, in the village, of Ellen Bruce's brief history; and the whole amount of it was that she was the orphan child of a friend of Mrs. Allen's, and had been adopted in her infancy, by that excellent woman, and treated with maternal kindness. `Oh, had providence destined her to my protection, what a solace, what a delight she would have been to me,' thought Mrs. Harrison: `and even now, could I persuade my husband to indulge me in going to the Allens, I might obtain this little creature to lighten some of my heavy hours.' She determined to watch for some propitious moment before she ventured to explain her wishes: a happy accident might throw the child again in her way, and such an accident she thought had occurred, when, a few days after the first interview, as she was walking with her husband past Mrs. Allen's, she saw the child come bounding towards her with her apron full of peaches. “Oh, how glad I am,” said she, on coming up to Mrs. Harrison, her eyes sparkling, and her cheeks glowing; “here, take them all, they are mine, and I saved them all for you.” “For me,” replied Mrs. Harrison, kissing her, “and for this gentleman.” “For the Duke! oh no,” replied little Ellen, with fatal simplicity; “Mr. Allen says the duke will not eat our peaches.” “What,” exclaimed Mr. Harrison, “does the little impudent baggage mean by calling me the duke?” “Every body calls him that name,” said Ellen, lowering her voice, and drawing closer to Mrs. Harrison. “Never mind, my love,” whispered Mrs. Harrisson, while she kissed her, “run home, and do come very soon to see me.” Then turning to her husband she said, “I declare our neighbours are half right; you have quite a look of nobility, my dear husband; you might pass in more knowing eyes than theirs for a peer of the realm: to say nothing of a certain dignity that belongs to the born gentleman, your gold-headed cane, your powdered head, and antique buckles give you an air that must be quite provoking to our republican neighbours.” “Ah indeed, I believe it, Mrs. Harrison, but our neighbours, as you call them, mean no compliment; this is a mere mockery on their lips.” “Oh yes,” replied Mrs. Harrison, “I suppose so: that is to say, it is a jocular title they have given you, to console themselves for your superiority.” “Very likely, very likely,” replied the husband, and then added, “I think Mrs. Harrison, my dear, that you must be convinced by this time, that the less you have to do with these people, the better.” Mrs. Harrison made no reply; she usually conformed to the spirit of the promise contained in the Dutch marriage service, maintaining silence in the presence of her husband; it was the least difficult expression of acquiescence, and long habit had given her a facility in this extraordinary virtue. The weeks passed on, autumn succeeded to summer, and Mrs. Harrison seemed farther than ever from procuring an intercourse with little Ellen. During the warm weather, she had occasionally seen her bounding over the field with the elastic step of joyous childhood, but now her careful guardian kept her cautiously within doors. It was a cold night, the last of November, Mrs. Harrison's household was all in bed except herself, and she, insensible to the blasts that howled about her dwelling, was poring over an interesting book, when she was reminded of the lateness of the hour by the candle sinking into the socket. At this moment, a bright light flashed through the window, and shone on the opposite wall; she hastened to the window to ascertain the cause, and screamed, “Oh heavens! Allen's house is on fire.” Her shriek aroused her husband, who exclaimed “Lord bless me, is it possible! call the servants my dear, and send them to help the poor folks.” Mrs. Harrison, without awaiting this direction, had hastened to awaken the servants; and then rushed out of the house herself, and proceeded with all possible speed to the Allens, full of the horrible VOL. I. L apprehension that the family would be consumed by the flames. The bright light clearly defined every object; the naked branches of the trees, every twig, every withered leaf she saw plainly, but heard no human voice, nor saw a moving form. Avoiding the public road, which was circuitous, she proceeded in a straight line across the fields, surmounted the fences almost unconsciously, and passed through the shallow stream that divided the farms. She was within a few yards of the house, the fowls roused from their roost were crowing, the pigeons startled from their nestling place were fluttering over the flames: still none of the family appeared. She screamed with all the power of her voice, while she hastened onward, despairing of the lives of the unfortunate family. The back part of the house, which she had approached was enveloped in flames; she passed around to the front, and at that moment the door opened, and Allen and his wife with her twin infants in her arms, rushed asit appeared from the midst of the fire. Mrs. Harrison caught her arm as she was passing her, “where,” she exclaimed, “is your child?” “My child!” she replied, amazed with terror, “Oh God! Ellen—she is there;” and hugging her children closer to her breast, she pointed to the flames. Mrs. Harrison looked around for assistance, there was no one near: Allen, stupified with fright, had gone with a single pail to a well at some distance from the house; other members of the family, who had escaped by different windows, were so bewildered with terror as to be incapable of rendering the slightest aid. Mrs. Harrison's resolution was instantly taken; “tell me where she sleeps,” she cried, “it may be possible to reach her through a window.” “Oh! there is no window, she is in the dark room next mine; and this—this is mine,” she added, pointing to a front apartment which the flames had not yet L 2 reached. Mrs. Harrison darted forward and entered the house; the flames were above her, before her, around her. The passage was so darkened with smoke that she could not perceive the door she sought, but inspired with preternatural courage, menaced with death on every side, already scorching with the heat, and nearly suffocated with the smoke, she pressed forward till she reached a passage-way that crossed the entrance at right angles. The flames now burst through the wall at the extremity opposite the door she had entered, and the air rushing in, rolled away a volume of smoke, and discovered Ellen standing at her door, with her hand still on the latch, a dog was crouching at her feet, yelping, pulling her night dress with his teeth, and urging her forward with the most expressive supplications; still the little creature shrunk from the terrors before her, unconscious of the fatal risk of delay. Mrs. Harrison snatched her in her arms, rushed through the door, and in an instant was at Mrs. Allen's side. Both instinctively sunk on their knees—no sound escaped from them, but the rapture of gratitude was in their hearts, and its incense rose to Him who had rescued them from impending death. The fire had been communicated from a back building, which was joined to the front (recently erected by Allen,) by a narrow covered passage. Fortunately, the wind, though blowing violently, was in a direction to retard the progress of the flames: to extinguish them was impossible, for the house was of wood, and the only fire engine in the town was at too great a distance to render any assistance. But had the family been self-collected after they were awakened by Mrs. Harrison's screams, they might have saved all the house contained of value. No one, however, seemed capable of a well-directed effort, till Roger, Mrs. Harrison's English servant, arriving on the field of action, called to Allen to follow him, and forcing his way through the window of Mrs. Allen's apartment, he succeeded in clearing it of the furniture, and placing it at a safe distance from the destructive element. The family, and the few persons who had come to their aid, gathered around the relics; little Ellen stood with one hand in Mrs. Harrison's, one arm lovingly encircled the neck of the faithful animal that first broke her slumbers; the whole group remained impotent and silent spectators, till the house sunk a ruin under the still crackling flames. Mrs. Harrison first broke silence; “I am sure my good friends,” said she, “you are thinking more of what is left than what is taken.” “Indeed you have guessed right, ma'am,” replied Allen, venting his agitated spirits in loud sobs. “The Lord that has spared my wife and little ones and Ellen, is welcome to all the rest. If I could but have saved my Bible that my mother gave me, and my wife's silver tankard, I would just care no more than if it was a bonfire.” The mention of the excepted articles seemed to recall to Mrs. Allen's mind something of importance. She exclaimed, “poor Ellen,” and looked anxiously around her, till her eye falling on a trunk, she hastily opened it and took from it a small box; then turning to her husband, “God be praised,” she said, “every thing of value is saved.” The first strong emotions of gratitude having been directed to the supreme Preserver, they now begun with one voice to pour out their thanks to Mrs. Harrison whose generous agency they felt deeply. She begged them to defer all such expressions, and urging the necessity of a shelter for their little ones, she insisted on their going home with her. The good farmer and his wife forgot their scruples in their gratitude and necessities; and in a short time they were comfortably housed at the Harrison mansion. After Mrs. Harrison had made every provision for the refreshment and repose of her guests, and after she had stowed away little Ellen in a room adjoining her own, and extended her hospitalities even to the dog, her faithful coadjutor in the preservation of the child, she retired to her own room, nerved by gratitude and joy, to the task of reconciling her husband to the liberties she had taken with the family mansion. So strikingly did she delineate the dangers and escape of the family, the risk she herself had run, the rescue of the child, and finally, the exertions of Roger, his truly English coolness and intrepidity, that Mr. Harrison himself anticipated the conclusion of the story, by exclaiming, “Lord bless me, my dear! I hope you brought the unfortunate people home with you?” “Certainly, my dear,” she replied. “You did right—perfectly right. There is no other establishment in Lansdown equal to giving them all a shelter. But Martha, my dear,” he continued, “you ran a great risk—quite an unwarrantable risk, considering the relative importance of your life to that of the child's.” “Oh! thank you, for thinking my life so important. I only acted like a dutiful wife, and emulated your example. You have forgotten at what hazard you saved Charles Lindsay's life.” “Forgotten! no, my dear; but then you know a man has always more self-possession than a woman, more mind for emergencies, and besides, Charles was the heir of an honourable family—some compensation for the risk. However, all is well that ends well. You have shown a spirit worthy of a noble name, Martha my dear; and I shall take particular pleasure in writing an account of the whole affair to Sir Harry by the next ship that sails for London.” Mrs. Harrison, having thus succeeded beyond her utmost hopes in making a favourable impression on the mind of her husband, retired to rest; her bosom filled with those sweet emotions that are the peculiar property and rich reward L 2 of the virtuous. If Mrs. Harrison felt any anxiety the succeeding day about the intercourse of the host and his guests, it was removed when she saw that the sense of protection and condescending kindness on the one part, and of gratitude on the other, produced a happy state of feeling between the respective parties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII. “Oh, 'tis the curse of love and still approved, When woman cannot love, when they're beloved.” Two Gentlemen of Verond. In the week following the destruction of his own house, Mr. Allen succeeded in obtaining another for the accommodation of his family till the following summer. The rigours of the stern season then approaching, rendering it necessary to defer the re-building of his own, Mrs. Harrison proposed to Mrs. Allen to leave Ellen Bruce at the mansion-house till she should again be re-established in her own home. There was such obvious advantages in this arrangement for the child, Mrs. Harrison pressed her request so earnestaly, and Mrs. Allen felt that it would be so ungrateful to refuse, that she yielded her own inclination, and left Ellen with her devoted friend. The presence of this sweet child operated on Mrs. Harrison's affections as the first breaking out of the sun after a long series of cloudy weather upon the physical constitution. She had been resigned in afflictions, patient under all those often recurring vexations and petty disappointments that are by general consent pronounced more trying to human virtue than great calamities; she had endured for twenty years the exacting consequential peevish selfishness of a husband, in all respects dissimilar to herself, in most inferior; and she had become neither nervous, petulant, nor selfish. Indeed so successful were her dutiful efforts, that all her acquaintance deemed her quite blind to her husband's faults; and that she was not, never appeared except when, to attain some good purpose, her cautious and adroit approaches to his mind betrayed that she knew where his prejudices were stationed, and where his passions ruled. If the hasty affection of her youth had been alienated by her husband's faults, their place had been supplied by the resolution of virtue, and by the tolerance of a tender nature that felt more pity than aversion for human frailty; and finally perhaps she loved him; for neither her words nor actions ever expressed that she did not: if the maidenly reserve that “never tells a love,” is the poet's eloquent theme, the matronly virtue that conceals the want of it, is certainly far more deserving of the moralist's praise. Little Ellen opened the fountain of Mrs. Harrison's affections; and such was the renovating influence produced on her, that her husband, who never dreamed whence it proceeded, remarked how prodigiously the country winter improved her health and spirits; and congratulated himself upon his wise decision to remove from the chilling airs of the coast to the family estate, always noted for its salubrious situation. Every moment of leisure Mrs. Harrison devoted to her little favourite. She taught her every thing she was capable of receiving at the age of five years, in the way of formal instruction. She was the ingenious mistress, and the partaker of her innocent revels. She insinuated moral, and it may be added, religious principles into her mind, in the winning form of stories. She warred against the natural selfishness of childhood in all its specious forms, and she completely subdued an impetuosity of temper, that had been suffered if not nurtured by Mrs. Allen's indulgence: in short she seemed constantly to realize that she had the training of an immortal creature; and to feel that so sweet a form as Ellen's should, “envelope and contain” naught but “celestial spirits.” Allen began with the return of summer the rebuilding of his house; and assisted by the voluntary contributions of his townsmen, he soon completed it. The prompt benevolence of our country people on such occasions has been justly celebrated by a foreigner, an observer, (perhaps a partial one) of our manners. “Ici tous sont egaux: l'abondance est commune, On ignore les noms de crime et d'infortune, Si le feu, si l'orage a fait un indigent, La bienfaisance accourt; c'est l'effet d'un moment.” The time at length arrived for Mrs. Allen to reclaim Ellen. Mrs. Harrison urged delay after delay, and was so earnestly seconded by her husband, (who had been beguiled of his uncomfortable stateliness by the playful little creature) that Mrs. Allen finally consented to surrender her own inclinations, and to make a permanent arrangement with Mrs. Harrison, which should allow Ellen to pass half her time at the mansion-house. In this arrangement there was a system of checks and balances that produced that singular and felicitous union of diversity of qualities which constituted the rare perfection of Ellen's character. Mrs. Harrison communicated her taste and skill in drawing, her knowledge of French and Italian, and all those arts of female handicraft that were the fashion of her day. Her pupil was taught curiously to explore the records of history, and to delight in the bright creations of poetry. When she might have been in danger of an exclusive taste for the occupations of those who have the privilege of independence and of leisure, she returned to Mrs. Allen, to take her lessons in practical life, to share and lighten the domestic cares of her good friend, and to acquire those household arts that it might be the duty of her station to perform, and which it is the duty of every station to understand. Ellen might have caught the pensiveness of Mrs. Harrison's manner, with its grace and polish: she might have forgotten the active duties of life in listening with her to the melody of nature—the music of the passing stream, the rustling of the leaves, or the song of the birds, or in watching the changeful forms of the summer clouds, as their shadows dropped on the mountain's side, or danced in frolic humours over the grassy fields and thick standing corn. But for all this, the danger of secluded life to those who possess sensibility and taste, there was an antidote in the occupations of Mrs. Allen's household—the spell of imagination was dispelled by the actual services of life. Had Ellen been less grateful or affectionate in her nature, she might have loved one of her guardians to the exclusion of the other; but she felt their gratuitous kindness with the sensibility of a truly generous mind; she saw in them the parents that Providence had provided for her orphanage, and without any of the pride or restlessness of dependence, her devotion to them both evinced her eager desire that they should realize all the beatitude of benevolence. Had her friends been less excellent than they were, some mischief might have resulted to our heroine from the diversity of their religious opinions. Both were Christians in faith and experience, but Mrs. Harrison was educated in the episcopal church, and was exact in all its observances: and Mrs. Allen, a real descendant of the pilgrims, was as rigid in her faith as was compatible with the mildness of her character. The `natural enmity' that bigots might have found, or made, between their respective faiths, was destroyed by the spirit of Christianity, as it must be, where that spirit bears rule, and the only strife between these noble-minded women seemed to be, which should most sedulously cultivate the virtues of their young friend. Mr. Harrison certainly not remarkable for his Christian graces, was scrupulous in maintaining all the appointments of the established church. He never countenanced by his august presence the worship of the village meeting. It was one of his favourite observations, and he uttered it with the pomp of an oracle, that puritanism was the mother of rebellion. He was always gratified with Ellen's respectful attendance on his reading of the church service; and he noticed more than once how remarkably well her voice sounded in the responses. He blamed his wife for not making an effort to prevent Ellen's going to the village meeting with the Allens during her residence with them, which he said she might easily do, as the girl certainly had sense enough to discern the difference between worship and talking. Allen too, dissatisfied with what he deemed his wife's lukewarmness, reproved her for not interposing her authority to prevent Ellen from `wasting the Sabbath in hearing a form of words read over by a man that had no more religion than the pope, and who all the while flattered himself that none but an episcopal tory could go to heaven.' Happily for the peace of our heroine, neither of the ladies deemed it her duty to interfere with the wishes of the other, and she grew up, nurtured in the spirit of our blessed religion, without bigotry toany of the forms with whichaccident, pride, or prejudice has invested it. Time rolled on, and every year found Ellen improved in loveliness: the gay and reckless spirit of childhood gave place to the vivacity and sensitiveness of fifteen. Mrs. Allen deemed it inexpedient to delay longer to communicate to her such particulars of her mother's history as she was at liberty to impart. It was impossible any longer to evade her natural and just curiosity on the subject, and as she could not for ever be kept in ignorance, Mrs. Allen thought it necessary that she should begin to fortify her mind for the evils that might await her. Ellen received the communication with a gentle submission to the trials of her lot that astonished both her friends,—for Mrs. Harrison had long been in Mrs. Allen's confidence—she saw that dark clouds enveloped her; still—for hope is the element of youth—except in some moments of fearful apprehension, she believed that she should yet enjoy a clear heaven and a bright day. The progress of time had wrought some changes in the Allen family. Edward, the only son, had been sent to Vermont, to reside in the family of Mr. Lenox his uncle, and George Lenox his cousin, a student in Harvard university, passed his vacations at Lansdown. The mother of Justyn Allen had become a widow, and had been induced by her children to fix her residence with them; and Mr. Allen had been persuaded by one of his neighbours to relinquish the toils of his farm for the easy acquisitions of trade, and to embark all the capital his credit could command in a mercantile enterprise. Mr. Harrison's infirmities had grown with his years. He passed his time in deprecating the encroaching spirit of Jacobinism, and in predicting the certain dissolution of the federal government. His prejudices operated like a distemper, and gave to every object a distorted form and threatening aspect. He saw nothing in our thriving institutions —in the diffusion of intelligence, virtue and prosperity through the mass of society, but menaces of degradation and elements of disorder. It is reported of our chief magistrate, that during his late visit to our northern metropolis, he exclaimed on beholding the concourse of well-dressed, well-behaved people assembled to greet him, “Where are your common people?” This exclamation, so flattering to a just republican pride, would have conveyed to the loyal ears of Robert Harrison a sense of hopeless degradation; for in his view every elevation of the commonalty depressed the level of the gentleman. Fortunately for him, the respect inspired by the good sense and benevolence of his wife shielded him from the insults which his folly provoked; and his connexion with Ellen Bruce was a link between him and his neighbours which protected him from their open scorn. Ellen, as her mind matured, became every day more dear and necessary to Mrs. Harrison, with whom, from fifteen to eighteen, her time was passed almost exclusively. Even Mr. Harrison condescended to say that he could not live without her, and his wife, availing herself of this favourable expression, ventured to suggest to him to make some provision for her favourite in case of the misfortune of his death. `He had nothing,' he said, `to dispose of, but the family estate, and that he thought could, with no propriety be diverted from flowing in its natural channel to the heir at law,' a distant relation, residing in England. Mrs. Harrison suggested that, as this gentleman had a noble revenue from his own estates, such an accession as their little property would be but as a drop to the ocean; and she urged that it would be in the spirit of the known generosity of his family to confer his bounty on an orphan; she intimated that Ellen was quite dependent on him, for except a few hundred dollars inherited from her parents, she had nothing, and could have no rational reliance on the Allens; for it had been for some time whispered in Lansdown that Allen, in his mercantile enterprise, had met with the fate of all those who, since the time of æsop's fish, have aspired to some other element than that for which Providence had destined them. All these arguments she stated so cogently that her husband was persuaded to comply with her wishes, and he promised that during a visit to Boston, whither he was going the next week to celebrate the king's birth-day, he would have his will duly drawn and executed, and devise the “family estate” to Ellen Bruce. This good resolution shared the fate of so many others left at the mercy of the casualties of life. Mr. Harrison went to Boston, and on the birth-day dined at the British consul's with a select band of loyalists. The illustrious occasion and the good cheer of his host tempted him to the excessive demonstrations of enthusiasm common on such occasions, and the consequence was that he died the succeeding night of on apoplexy. A few months subsequent to Mr. Harrison's death, Justyn Allen also paid the debt of nature, and in consequence of the unfortunate issue of his mercantile enterprise, left his wife, his old mother, and his children, without any provision. The loss of her husband and the ruin of their affairs, aggravated a mortal disease under which Mrs. Allen had been for some time suffering; and as if the family was destined to illustrate the common remark that troubles never come singly, Emily became so sickly that a physician pronounced change of air to be necessary to her. At this time Susan Allen (whom our readers may remember as the sister of Justyn Allen, who remained finally attached to the shaker society) arrived at Lansdown on her way to visit a society of her own people at Harvard. Mrs. Allen, anxious to remove Emily from VOL. I. M the distressing scenes that she was conscious awaited her at home, thankfully accepted a proposition which her aunt made, to take her upon this excursion for the benefit of the ride and change of place. Unforeseen circumstances detained her for a long time within the sphere of her aunt's influence; and her mind weakened, and her spirits dejected, she adopted, as has been seen, the strange faith of her enthusiastic relative. In the mean time Ellen, devoted to the care of Mrs. Allen, allowed herself no relaxation but that of passing a few hours occasionally with Mrs. Harrison. It was during one of these visits that Mrs. Harrison inquired if Allen's affairs were so fatally involved as to render it necessary to surrender the house to his creditors. Ellen believed not. “George Lenox,” she said, “had advanced two hundred dollars to redeem a portion of the property.” “George Lenox!” exclaimed Mrs. Harrison “how, dear Ellen, has he the ability to do so generous an act?” “He draws on talent and industry,” replied Ellen, “and I do not believe his drafts will ever be dishonoured.” “I know, my love,” rejoined Mrs. Harrison, “that youth forms vast expectations from those resources, but I likewise know that they are not always answered by ready money.” Ellen explained to Mrs. Harrison that young Lenox, after defraying his expences at the university, had that amount of money remaining—the fruit of his industry and economy. “Such a gift,” said Mrs. Harrison, “his all, was indeed most generous, and deserves the bright reward that is glowing on your cheek at this moment; but still I do not quite comprehend how your young wits have contrived to satisfy the demand on the portion of the property redeemed with two hundred dollars.” The glow that had suffused Ellen's cheek deepened as she replied “dearest Mrs. Harrison, forgive me if I have not dealt frankly with you; I wished to avoid exciting M 2 your tender, but, believe me, unnecessary solicitude about me. I have made the best use of my little inheritance in appropriating it to the relief of my friends: the sum, as you know, was originally four hundred dollars. It has been more than doubled by Mr. Allen, more prudent in the management of my affairs than his own; and yesterday I had the happiness of giving it into George Lenox's hands, and of seeing the joy of Mrs. Allen, when it was announced to her by her principal creditor that a valuable portion of her property had been redeemed by an unknown friend; and had you seen the expression that lit up her sick face, when she exclaimed, `thank God! my old mother will not have to go forth from her son's house to seek a shelter in her old age, and my children, my dear children, may come home to live again under their father's roof.' Oh, Mrs. Harrison, you might have envied me the pleasure of that moment, had it cost me ten thousand times the paltry sum I sacrificed for it.” “Then she is ignorant of her benefactor?” “Yes—but do not give me that name—benefactor! dear Mrs. Harrison, it can only be because I owe to you an equal debt, that you forget my obligations to Mrs. Allen: did not she save my helpless infancy from neglect, and without a mother's instincts or rights, has she not nurtured me with a mother's tenderness?” “You are right—you are right, my noble-minded Ellen,” replied Mrs. Harrison, as Ellen paused in her appeal: “my fear of the possible evils you may encounter (should I be removed from you) from want and dependence afflicts me with undue anxiety. I hope I should have courage enough not to shrink from any evils that menaced myself, but when I think of your being exposed to a cold selfish world, I feel a mother's timidity; you, with your strange mysterious history, Ellen, your inexperience, your generous confiding temper, with all that refinement that I have foolishly, perhaps sinfully, delighted to watch stealing over your character, with all the graces that fit you for —” “Oh, stop dear Mrs. Harrison, this is strange language for you to hold, and me to hear; my highest ambition is to do well my duty in whatever station Providence assigns me. This is an ambition, as you have taught me, that cannot be disappointed; here the race is to the swift, and the battle to the strong. I will not,” she added, playfully, “any longer expose my humility to temptation;” and she put on her hat, and stooped to her friend for a farewell kiss, when Mrs. Harrison said, “not yet, Ellen, you must not go till you have explained to me this benevolent sympathy of yours and young Lenox's; this generous union of your fortunes is doubtless received by him as a good omen?” “The event of our friend's happiness has already interpreted the omen, and explained all its significance,” replied Ellen, rising and walking away from Mrs. Harrison. “Now come back to me, Ellen,” said she, “and seat yourself here on my footstool, and if your tongue will not speak the truth, I must read it in your truth-telling eyes and cheeks.” Ellen turned towards her friend for the first time in her life reluctantly; and re-seating herself, she said with an embarrassed air, “I scarcely can conjecture what you expect from me.” “I will not tax your sagacity to conjecture, but come directly to the point —do you love George Lenox?” “Most certainly I do; I should be the most ungrateful—” “Pshaw, my dear Ellen, it is not the love that springs from any such dutiful source as gratitude which is in question at this moment; but that mysterious sentiment, inexplicable, uncontrolable which does not require, and seldom, I fear, admits a reason for its existence.” “I should be sorry, indeed, to confess or to feel such a sentiment for any one.” “Evading, again! Ah, dear Ellen, the nature of the animal is known by its doublings. You are so deep in the science as to demand the use of technics: tell me then, are you in love with George Lenox?” “Indeed I am not—you know I am not, Mrs. Harrison.” “I fancied I knew that you were not, but nothing less than a gift of second sight is infallible on such occasions; we must go a little farther, Ellen, even at the risk of deepening the crimson on your cheeks—you surely are not unconscious that Lenox is in love with you?” “He has never told me so,” replied Ellen. “That may be—young Edwin `never talked of love'—but without much experience, you know there are expressions that speak this passion more emphatically than language: and, exempt as you are from vanity, I think you cannot have misunderstood this amiable young man's devotion to you—his eagerness for your society, his anxiety to gratify all your wishes, his eye fixed on you as if he were spell-bound—” “O say no more,” exclaimed Ellen, hiding her face on her friend's lap, “I have understood George, but I hoped—” “To be able to make an appropriate return. Have I made out your meaning?” “Far from it—I hoped that our approaching separation—that new pursuits, new objects, would efface the accidental preference which has arisen from our early and confidential intercourse.” “In short, you trusted to those accidents over which you have no control, to heal the wound that your kindness, your unreserved manner, to this poor young man has been for years deepening.” “Oh, dear Mrs. Harrison, of what do you suspect me—of the baseness of coquetry?” “No, Ellen, no, you are incapable of M 3 trifling with the happiness of any one; your error has arisen from inexperience. I should have cautioned you but I am not fit to be your guide and counsellor in affairs of this nature, for though I have lived more than half a century, my secluded, childless life has offered few opportunities of observation, and fewer still where my sagacity has been stimulated by interest. I forgive your surprise and your indignation, my love, at what you imagined my suspicion of coquetry, for I know nothing more selfish, heartless, base, and degrading, than for a woman to encourage, nay permit the growth of an affection which she has no intention of returning.” “I should detest such a miserable triumph of vanity.” exclaimed Ellen; “I should hate myself were I capable of it, and George, kind, generous as he is, the sufferer. What ought I to do— can I do any thing now,” she asked, with the impatience of a generous mind, to repair the evil it has inflicted?” “No, my love,” replied Mrs. Harrison, “it is only by leaving undone, that mischief can be avoided in affairs of this kind. George goes to-morrow, avoid seeing him again, if you can without apparent design, for farewell words and looks furnish food for the sweet and bitter fancies of a brain-sick lover during any interval of absence. “The severe suffering,” she continued, as she marked the deep melancholy that had succeeded Ellen's usually animated expression, “you feel at this moment, from having been the involuntary cause of disappointment to your friend, will teach you in future jealously to guard the happiness that may be exposed to the influence of your attraction. You are in no danger of the silly vanity of fancying that civility means love, and of giving importance to every trifling gallantry; but modest—humble in your self estimate, you are in danger of wounding deeply the bosom that is bared to your involuntary shafts.” “There is no need of caution for the future,” replied Ellen, “no one else will ever care for me so much as George does.” “That may be, dear Ellen, but as you are scarce eighteen, it is possible that you have not finished your experience in love affairs; if you preserve that woe-begone visage indeed, any other safeguard against the effect of your charms will be quite superfluous: come, my love, cheer up, and let me hear your sweet voice at my dinner table, as sweet to me as minstrelsy to an old chieftain.” Ellen made a vain effort to recover her spirits, and then hurried away that she might indulge her ingenuous sorrow without giving pain to her friend. She was careful to follow Mrs. Harrison's prudent counsel, and when George Lenox came to pass his last evening with her, he received a friendly farewell message, with the information, that her duty to Mrs. Allen precluded her seeing him again. Before the morning dawned George was in a stage-coach on his way to the south. He passed the boundary of Lansdown with almost as heavy a heart as our first parent bore through the gates of Paradise: feeling like all true lovers, “that the world is divided into two parts; that where she is, and that where she is not.” It would be difficult to say whether Mrs. Harrison was most gratified or disappointed by the result of her investigation into the state of Ellen's affections. While she lived her annuity was ample for the support of Ellen and herself; but nothing could be more precarious than such a dependence, and Ellen might be left to encounter alone the wants of life. Young Lenox had promising talents, and those “getting along” faculties, that are a warrant for success: his devoted attachment was merit in the eyes of Mrs. Harrison; still he wanted those refined habits, that delicacy of taste, the result of cultivation, and those graces of manner to all which Mrs. Harrison from her early habits and associations, gave (it may be) an undue importance. There is such a taste for learning (we use the word in its provincial sense) pervading all ranks in New England,—if indeed ranks can be predicated of a society where none dare to define the dividing lines, and few can perceive them—that we often see those advanced to the most conspicuous stations in society, whose boyish years have been spent in ploughing the narrow fields of the patrimonial farm. There are some disagreeable results from this state of things, on the whole so honourable; and Mrs. Harrison felt that in implanting in Ellen the tastes that belonged to the highest grades of society, and in cultivating the habits of the “born lady,” she had conferred a superiority of doubtful value; and she was almost led to regret the fastidiousness which had been her own work, when she felt herself compelled to trace to it Ellen's rejection of the affection of one who was her equal in all important respects, and whose excellent character and flattering prospects would have rendered a connexion with him highly advantageous. We said Mrs. Harrison almost regretted the state of Ellen's heart—we fear she did not quite, for in common with the best individuals, she sometimes sacrificed general and immutable principles to the indulgence of her favourite peculiarities. Mrs. Allen's life closed at the end of a few painful weeks, and Ellen, after having performed every service for her with the strictest fidelity, wept over her with filial sorrow. Old Mrs. Allen soon after joined her grandson at Eton, and Ellen thus unfettered by duty, returned to Mrs. Harrison's, where her life passed happily in pursuits congenial to her taste, till she was summoned to Vermont by intelligence of the threatening illness of Edward Allen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX. “See what a ready tongue suspicion hath.” Henry IVth. Our readers no doubt will think it is quite time that we should return from our long digression to the family at Eton. There nothing occurred worthy their notice till one evening Mrs. Lenox entering Miss Bruce's apartment, said, “Ellen are you here, and quite alone?” “Quite alone,” replied Ellen, “Miss Redwood has not left her father's room since they took their tea.” “I am glad of it—glad the girl has the grace to stay with him even for half an hour, though her society seems to be of little use or consolation; and particularly glad, dear Ellen, to find you alone. I must interrupt your starlight meditations, or rather give you an interesting subject for them: but we shall want a light, for I have brought you a letter to read.” “A letter!”— “Yes, my dear, a letter, and to me the most delightful I ever received.” She was about to proceed to divulge its contents, when both she and Ellen were startled by a sound about Miss Redwood's bed. Mrs. Lenox advanced to the bed and laid her hand on it. “There is no one here,” she said, “I fancied I heard a sound.” “I fancied so too,” said Ellen. “Happily we were both mistaken, my dear, for I should be very sorry to tell my story to any ears but yours. Ellen, I am the proudest and happiest of mothers; I have just received a letter from George, which proves that he is worthy of his prosperity.” “I am very glad of it.” “And do you not yet, Ellen, suspect the reason you have to be glad—do you not know that George loves you?” “Oh, I hope not!” exclaimed Ellen involuntarily. “Hope not, my dear Ellen! I am sure there is not another in the world so worthy of his love—not another, who would be such an ornament to the station in which George will place his wife—not another that I should be so happy to call my child.” She paused for a moment for a reply, but Ellen said nothing. “Do not,” Mrs. Lenox continued, “repress your feelings. George, like a dutiful son, has made me his confidante, and why should not you? George himself can hardly love you better than I do.” “Thank you—thank you, Mrs. Lenox.” “No, my dear, you must not thank me, you are worthy your good fortune, and your own merit has secured it. I have used no influence, though I would have done any thing to have brought about the connection; but this is George's unbiassed decision, he confesses to me he has loved you ever since he was a boy. Is not such a good and constant heart worth having, Ellen, not to mention being the wife of a celebrated young clergyman?” Here the happy mother again paused, and again wondered she received no reply. “Not a word, Ellen? well, you shall have your own way; it is in vain to expect common sense, or a common way of showing it, from girls in love: so I will just bring you a candle, and leave you to read the letter by yourself: only remember that the southern mail goes, out to-morrow, and that lovers like to have their declarations come back to them as quick as echoes.” Thus saying, Mrs. Lenox rose to leave the room, when Ellen caught her by the arm, and exclaimed, “stop one moment Mrs. Lenox, and hear me.” “Hear you, dear Ellen; George himself could scarcely be more delighted to hear you.” Ellen's tongue seemed to be again paralysing, but making a strong effort, she said, “you know, Mrs. Lenox, what reasons I have for wishing to defer for the present all thoughts of marriage; you know that I ought not to involve any one in my unhappy destiny; you know—George does not—that possibly disgrace awaits me.” “But, my dearest Ellen, what is all this to the purpose? Have you so poor an opinion of my son's attachment to you, as to fancy that the worst issue of your uncertainties which you can apprehend would be a straw in his way? No! he loves you, for yourself alone—truly —devotedly loves you.” Ellen was quite overcome with the generous, affectionate zeal of the mother, and bursting into tears, she clasped Mrs. Lenox's hand in hers, and said, “I do not deserve this, my dear, kind friend; I have not been frank with you. I do not,” she added, faltering, “I do not love George.” “Not love him!” exclaimed Mrs. Lenox, drawing back from Ellen, “not love him, Ellen! it can't be, child—it is impossible.” Poor Ellen at this moment wished it were impossible; she sunk back in her chair, and dark as the room was, instinctively covered her face with her handkerchief, while her friend, in great agitation, walked up and down the room, talking half to herself and half to Ellen. “Not love him! I cannot believe it; you have always known him. You know there is not a blemish on his character. A pious minister—a man of education and talents—very good talents—quite uncommon talents—and a better tempered boy never lived; and as to his appearance, there may be handsomer men than George, but there never was a pleasanter look—a good faithful son he has been—and brother, and that is a sure sign he will be a good husband: and he loves you, Ellen;” she concluded, pausing, and placing her hand on Ellen's shoulder, “and you can't be in your right mind if you do not love him.” Ellen felt that it would be in vain to attempt to convince the fond mother that that could be a right mind which did not, as she would think, justly appreciate George's merits: and she was too delicate, too gentle to attempt to vindicate herself. She was grateful for the mother's and the son's generous preference of an isolated being; and approaching alone the crisis of her fate, she was reluctant to refuse the kind protecting arm that was stretched out to succour and protect her. She faltered for a moment in the resolution she had instinctively taken: she could not bear to afflict, perhaps to alienate her partial friends—she might be able to command her affections. But alas! the spirit would not come when she did call it; for when Mrs. Lenox, suspecting some infirmity of purpose from Ellen's continued silence, said, in a softened tone, “It was but a girlish silly feeling after all—was it, dear Ellen? you will not be such a child as to throw away the prize you have drawn.” She replied with a dignified decision that blasted Mrs. Lenox's reviving hopes. “I have nothing to give for that prize, and it cannot be mine. George must seek some one who can return his affections, and thus deserve them—I cannot.” “Well, this is most extraordinary,” replied Mrs. Lenox, “why what do you wish for? what do you expect, Ellen?” “Nothing, nothing in the world, Mrs. Lenox, but your, and your son's forgiveness, for what must seem to you ingratitude, insensibility; for myself,” she added, “my path is a solitary one; but there is light on it from heaven; and if I can preserve the kindness of my friends, I shall have courage and patience for the rest.” There was so much purity and truth and feeling in Ellen's words, that Mrs. Lenox could not retain the resentment that in spite of her better feelings had risen in her bosom. “Our forgiveness!” she replied, kindly, “Oh Ellen, you need not ask our forgiveness. George, poor fellow, thinks you can do no wrong, and I always did think so: and even now I do not feel so much for my son as to see you so blind to your own happiness.” How long this conference, so unsatisfactory to the mother and embarrassing to Ellen, might have continued, it is impossible to say, had it not been interrupted by the entrance of Miss Redwood. “Ah!” she exclaimed, “a tête a tête, confidential, no doubt; I am sorry to interrupt it,” she continued, looking at both the ladies, and observing the signs of emotion that were too evident to escape notice; “it seems to have been interesting. Come Lilly, you lazy wretch,” she added, turning to the servant, who was lying stretched out on the floor at the foot of the bed, “get up, and undress me; I have been dying with sleep this half hour, while papa was prosing away at me.” Lilly's appearance on the floor at the entrance of the light explained to the ladies the noise they had heard; they exchanged looks of mutual intelligence, but both concluding she had been asleep, they gave themselves no farther concern about her. Mrs. Lenox bade the young ladies good night, and repaired to her husband with a heavy heart to acquaint him with the result of George's suit. He, good easy man, after expressing some surprise, concluded with the truisms, that girls were apt to be notional; that to be sure Ellen was a likely young woman, but there were plenty of fish in the sea, and good ones too, that would spring at a poorer bait than George could throw out; and besides, he added, by way of consolation, there was something of a mist about Ellen, and though he should not have made that an objection seeing that she was a good girl, and George had an idea about her, yet, as VOL. I. N matters had turned out as they had, he believed it was all for the best. Mrs. Lenox thought her husband had very inadequate notions of Ellen Bruce's merits, but she was wise enough to refrain from disturbing his philosophy on this trying occasion. Soon after Mrs. Lenox left the young ladies' apartment, Miss Bruce took her hat and shawl and stole softly down stairs. Miss Redwood listened to her footsteps till she heard the house door close after her. “In the name of Heaven, Lilly,” she demanded of her servant, “what can she have gone out for at this time in the evening?” “I am not the witch that can tell that, Miss Caroline; but one thing I can tell, I heard her say to Doctor Bristol as I passed them, standing together in the entry just before he went away to-day, `I shall not fail to be there.”' Nothing could be more indefinite than Lilly's information; however, it was more satisfactory than none, and after pondering on it for a moment, her mistress said, “your ears are worth having, girl—tell me, did you hear what Miss Bruce and Mrs. Lenox were talking about in the dark here?” “That did I, Miss Caroline, trust me for using my ears. I waked when Mrs. Lenox came into the room, and was just starting up, when, thinks I to myself, they'll be saying something about Miss Cary, and I'll just lie snug and hear it—it will be nuts for her.” “Did they talk about me? what said they? tell me quick.” “Why, Miss Cary, they said just nothing at all about you: no more than if you was'ent nobody.” “What in the name of wonder then did they talk about—what could they have to say?” asked Miss Redwood, wondering internally that there should be any field of vision in which she was not the most conspicuous object. N 2 “Oh, Miss Cary,” replied Lilly, their talk was all about themselves; that is to say about Miss Bruce and Mr. George Lenox, that I told you was going to marry her; but it appears she is all off the notion of it now, though his mother begged her as hard as a body might beg for your striped gown that you don't wear any more, Miss Cary.” “My striped gown—you may have it Lilly, but tell me what Mrs. Lenox said, and what Miss Bruce, and all about it.” Lilly proceeded to the details, and by her skilful use of the powers of memory and invention, she made out a much longer conversation then we have reported to our readers; from which conversation Caroline deduced the natural inference that Miss Bruce would not sacrifice the opportunity of an advantageous connexion without a good and sufficient reason. What could be that reason? The attempt to solve this mystery led her into a labyrinth of conjectures, from which there was no clue for extrication but the apparent and mutual interest that subsisted between her father and Miss Bruce. It was possible that Ellen indulged hopes of a more splendid alliance than that with George Lenox. Caroline really had too much sense to allow much force to this extraordinary conclusion; still she continued alternately to dwell on that, and on the reason of Miss Bruce's absence, till Lilly spoke of the expected arrival of the Westalls. This opened a new channel for her thoughts—the debût of a new beau, a possible admirer, could rival any other interest, and before she sunk to sleep, Ellen's affairs subsided to the insignificance which they really bore in relation to Miss Redwood. Caroline found other influences as unfriendly to sleep as the “bracing air of the lake.' She awoke with the first beam of day, and instinctively raised her head from her pillow to ascertain whether Ellen Bruce's bed was unoccupied; it was, but her ear caught the sound of a footstep in the entry, and immediately after Ellen entered with as little noise as possible. “You need not be so quiet, Miss Bruce,” said Caroline, “I am wide awake.” “I am happy if I do not disturb you,” replied Ellen, “still I must be quiet on account of the family.” `Ah,' thought Caroline, `the family then know nothing of this manœuvre.' “You look excessively pale and wearied, Miss Bruce.” “I am wearied,” replied Ellen, without gratifying or even noticing Miss Redwood's curiosity: “but,” she added, as she threw herself on the bed, “I shall have time before breakfast to refresh myself.” Caroline with the transmuting power of jealousy, had converted Ellen's simplest actions into aliments for her suspicions, and now that a circumstance had occurred which did not readily admit of an explanation, she exulted in the expectation of a triumph over her father, who had treated her curiosity in relation to Ellen as quite childless and groundless. “Your favourite, papa,” she said, seizing a favourable opportunity when she was sitting alone with her father after dinner, “has a singular taste for walking.” “It may appear singular to you, Caroline, with your southern habits; but I imagine you will not find it uncommon at the north.” “O, north or south, papa, I fancy it is not common for lady pedestrians to pass the whole night in promenades.” “The whole night—what do you mean, my child?” Caroline explained. Her father listened to her detail with undisguised interest, and after a few moments' pause, he said, “it would have been natural and quite proper, as you are Miss Bruce's room-mate, that you should have asked of her the reason of her absence last night—did you so? “Oh, thank you, papa, no; I have not yet taken lessons enough of these question-asking Yankees, to inquire into that which this lady of mysteries evidently chooses to keep secret, even from her dear friends the Lenoxes.” “Well, my dear, since you will not or cannot gratify your curiosity, I advise you to suspend it, and to do yourself and Miss Bruce the justice to remember the remark of a sagacious observer, that the `simplest characters sometimes baffle all the art of decipherers.' You look displeased, Caroline—let us talk on some subject on which we shall agree better. I think we may look for the Westalls to-day.” “Thank Heaven!—any change will be agreeable.” “Agreeable as a change, no doubt— but the society of the Westalls will, I hope, have some more enduring charm than novelty; the mother I am certain will be quite to your taste—and to the son, if report speaks truly, no young lady can be indifferent.” “How papa, is he handsome, clever, rich, accomplished?” “Handsome—If I had seen Charles Westall within the last half hour, I should hardly presume to decide on so delicate a point: he was but four years old when I parted from him, of course I only recollect him as a child. I have been told however by some Virginians who have visited the north that he is the image of his father; if so, he has an appearance that ladies usually honour with their favour—manly, intelligent, and expressive of every benevolent affection.” “Not one of your soft-amiable gentle-zephyr youths I hope, papa?—they are my aversion.” “Not precisely; but if his face resembles his father's, it rather indicates a natural taste for domestic life than for the `shrill fife and spirit-stirring drum' N 3 —for the peace than the war establishment; but I shall leave you to decide on his beauty, Caroline,” continued Mr. Redwood, as he noticed a slight blush on his daughter's cheek at what she considered an allusion to her military preference. “`Is he clever?' is I think the second question in the order of your interrogatories; to this point I have the most satisfactory testimonials: he has received the first honours of the first university in our country—has finished the study of the law with one of the most eminent men at the north, and has received the proposal of a most advantageous partnership with his instructor, which he has just accepted.” “Then if he is going into the drudgery of business, he is not rich of course, papa? “No, Caroline, he is not rich,”—Mr. Redwood was on the point of adding, “and of what consequence is that to us?” but he remembered in time, that it was his policy to conceal from his wayward daughter his own views; and he said, after a momentary pause, “his father's rash generosity impoverished his estate. The father was an enthusiast, Caroline; he thought as we all do of the curse of slavery.” “The curse of slavery? lord, papa, what do you mean? there is no living without slaves.” “I fear, my child, that we shall find there is no living with them; but besides the universal feeling in relation to the evil of slavery, Westall's father had some peculiar notions.—During his life, he gave to many of his slaves their freedom.” “Oh shameful!” exclaimed Caroline, “when every body allows, that all our danger is from the freed slaves.” “Westall endeavoured as far as possible to obviate that danger. He reserved the noble gift for those who were qualified for it by some useful art, or a habit of independent industry. At his death he bequeathed their liberty to all who remained on the plantation. This it appears he deemed not generous but just, as he stated in his will, that in resigning his property in them he merely restored to them a natural right which they had received from their Creator, and which he had only withheld in the hope of fitting them to enjoy it, but which he would not leave in the power of any one to detain from them.” “What nonsense, papa; and so by the indulgence of these whims he beggared poor Charles?” “It cannot be denied that young Westall's inheritance was impaired by his father's singular, or it may be, fanatical notions of justice: for the value of a southern plantation is graduated by the number of its slaves, and without them it is much in the condition of a cart without a horse. There was no hypocrisy in my friend's professed dislike of slavery; it was deep-rooted and unconquerable, and to it he sacrificed every pecuniary advantage. According to the absolute provision of his will his plantation was sold, and his widow and son removed to the north. Charles's fortune, though reduced, has been adequate to the expenses of a first-rate education; he has inherited the disinterestedness of his father's spirit, for I find that since coming of age he has vested nearly all that remained of his property in an annuity for his mother; he has a few thousand dollars left to start with, and as the `winds and waves are always favourable to the ablest navigators,' I do not doubt that his talents and industry will ensure him success. As to his accomplishments, Caroline, you and I affix probably different meanings to the term, and therefore I will leave you to satisfy your interrogatory on that head after you shall have seen him.” “Different meanings, papa; every body knows what accomplished means —does he speak French? does he dance well? Is he genteel and elegant, and all that?” “Oh perfectly genteel, my dear,” replied the father with a smile, “he was born and bred a gentleman, and has the mind and spirit of a gentleman; he is, I am told, approved by wise fathers, courted by discreet mothers, and what you will probably consider much more unequivocal testimony—the favourite of fair daughters. But, Caroline,” continued Mr. Redwood, checking himself from the fear that his daughter would perceive his solicitude to secure her favourable opinion of Westall, “I think your long confinement to the house has robbed you of your bloom. The rumour of your beauty has doubtless reached the ears of my young friend, and I should be sorry that your first appearance should not answer his expectations—ah, there goes Miss Bruce on one of her walking expeditions. Miss Bruce,” he added, speaking to Ellen through the window, “you are an absolute devotee to nature—will you permit my daughter to be the companion of your walk, and show her some of the shrines at which you worship?” “I am only an admirer, not an idolater,” replied Ellen, smiling; “and I am certain, that if Miss Redwood will do me the favour to accompany me, she will answer for me that my homage is reasonable.” Miss Redwood readily acquiesced in the arrangement—the wish to restore her bloom was a controlling motive; and the animating expectation of the arrival of the Westalls had for the moment made her forget her dislike to Ellen: Lilly was summoned with her hat and gloves, and the young ladies proceeded arm in arm towards the lake. “What a delightful compensation we have,” said Ellen, “for the suffering from our long sultry summer days in the reviving influence of the approaching evening; its sweet cool breath refreshes all nature, and restores elasticity and vigour to mind and body.” “You have, no doubt, an advantage in your cool evenings,” replied Caroline, “the only one, as far as I see, of the north over the south.” Ellen suppressed her opinion—perhaps partial—that her companion did not see very far. “I am not such a bigot,” said she, “as to believe that your country does not possess, in many respects, the advantage over ours; but I confess I have prejudices so strong in favour of our lofty mountains, deep valleys, and broad lakes, that I do not believe I should ever admire the tame level of Carolina; but it is hardly necessary for me to be thus boastful while this scene is itself so eloquently pleading its claims to your admiration: look, Miss Redwood,” she continued, “where the lake reflects the bright tints of the evening sky, and there where the long shadows of the trees seem to sleep on its bosom—is there, can there be in the wide world a lovelier spot than this?” “It may be,” replied Caroline, “it is, no doubt, exceedingly pretty; but to own the truth to you, Miss Bruce, I can never forget that this lake shore was the scene of our disaster. After that horrible storm and fright it is natural it should have no beauty in my eyes; besides, you know, one that is not used to the country gets so tired of it, that it is quite impossible to admire it; but see,” she added, changing her languid tone to one nearly as animated as Ellen's had been: “see, Miss Bruce, those beautiful wild flowers that are growing there close to the water's edge; I should so like to get them to dress my hair against the Westalls arrive: they would form a beautiful contrast. I had a bunch of snow-drops last winter that all the world said were particularly becoming to me; these flowers are as white and beautiful, and being natural, they would have quite a rural pretty effect.” “A beautiful effect no doubt, Miss Redwood, but alas! they are `not to be come at by the willing hand;' if we had the imagination of some poets, who are fond of infusing their own sensations into flowers, we might fancy these were enjoying their security, and laughing at the vanity of your wishes.” “But,” said Caroline, “it surely is not impossible to get at them;” and espying a fisherman's canoe which was fastened to a tree against which they were standing, she proposed to Ellen, who, she said, she was sure knew how to guide it, to procure the flowers for her. “Indeed, Miss Redwood,” replied Ellen, “I am no water-nymph, and these canoes require as much skill to guide them as the egg-shells in which witches and fairies are said to traverse the waters.” “But, the water is not deep,” insisted Caroline, “and if the worst happens, you will but get your clothes wet, and you have nothing on that can be injured.” The inexorable Ellen resisted this argument, though Miss Redwood enforced it by a rapid glance of comparison from Ellen's simple muslin frock to her own richly trimmed silk dress. There was an inlet of water where the ladies stood, around which the margin curved to the point where the flowers grew at the base of a rock, and so near the water's edge (for the earth had been worn away by the surge) that it could hardly be said from which element they sprung, earth or water. A small birch tree had grown out of a cleft in the rock, and was completely overgrown by a grape vine, which, after embowering it, dropped its rich drapery over the perpendicular side of the rock, and hung there, in festoons so light and graceful, that one might fancy they had sportively peeped over the rock to look at their beautiful image in the pure mirror below. After Caroline's last argument had failed, she jumped into the canoe herself, and unhooking it from the tree to which it was attached, she exultingly exclaimed, “nothing venture, nothing have;” and gaily pushed off towards the object of her wishes. The water was shallow, and apparently there was not the least danger. Caroline, however, had given too powerful an impetus to the frail bark she was guiding, and it struck against the rock with so much force as to recoil with a fluttering motion. Caroline was frightened, and increased by her agitation the irregular motion of the canoe; Ellen perceived the dangerous operation of her terrors, but before she could make her comprehend that all that was necessary was that she should sit down quietly, Caroline had grasped the pendant vine which was strong and tenacious, and the canoe had passed from under her. It drifted a few yards, and then remained stationary at the base of the rock. The rock was perpendicular, and too high for Miss Redwood too reach its summit. Ellen perceived, at a single glance, the dilemma in which Caroline's fears had involved her, and perceived and adopted the only mode of extricating her from her awkward situation. She ran around the curve of the shore, ascended the rock where the ascent was gradual, and letting herself down as gently as possible into the canoe, she rowed immediately to the relief of the distressed damsel, whose arms already trembled with the weight which they sustained. “Oh, I am dead with fright!” she exclaimed, as soon as a certainty of recovered safety restored to her the use of her tongue: “for Heaven's sake tell me, Ellen, how you got to me; I thought you dropped from the skies.” Ellen explained that she had reached her by natural and easy means. “Well,” said Caroline, “it was very good—very kind of you, and I never—never shall forget it; but pray get me back to the shore —for all the flowers in Paradise I would not endure such another fright.” “But we will not,” said Ellen, “return to the shore without a trophy for your daring to venture to the only place where even fear could create peril. These flowers,” she added, plucking them, “were the cause of all the mischief, and they shall die for it.” She then rowed back to the shore, and was tastefully arranging the flowers in Caroline's hair, saying, at the same time, that “if she had made herself a water-nymph, they would still have been a fit coronal for her,” when the attention of both the ladies was attracted by the rapid approach of a gentleman whom they perceived to be a stranger. A frock coat and Madras cravat announced a traveller; and a brief glance of Caroline's practised eye satisfied her who it must be that so gracefully wore this costume—and as he came up to them she exclaimed, `Mr. Westall!' It was Charles Westall conducted by little Lucy Lenox. He courteously thanked Miss Redwood for saving him from the awkward necessity of introducing himself. He had, as he said, just arrived at Mr. Lenox's with his mother, and had been sent by her with his little guide in quest of Miss Redwood; that while descending the hill he had been a witness of Miss Redwood's danger, and had hastened on in the hope of being so fortunate as to assist at her rescue; but fate had been unkind to him, for the pleasure of playing the hero on this occasion was not only wrested from him, but he was forced to witness and admire the celerity with which the rescue had been effected without his aid. Miss Redwood turned to introduce Ellen, but she had walked forward with Lucy, who, with childish eagerness, was telling her how frightened she was when she saw her jump from the rock, and that for a million Miss Redwoods she would not have had Ellen run the risk of being drowned. Never was there a happier moment for the power of Miss Redwood's beauty. The joy of recovered safety, and the pleasure of surprise had deepened her colour; her gratitude to Ellen had given a touch of unwonted softness to her expression, and the simple decoration of the white flowers mingling with her jet glossy curls, was far more beautiful than their usually elaborate arrangement. When the ceremony of introduction to Mrs. Westall was over, and Caroline with extraordinary animation had expressed her pleasure at the interview, Mrs. Westall, impatient to ascertain the first impression on her son, whispered, “Charles, is she as beautiful as you expected?” “As beautiful, mother! you honour my imagination too much; she is more beautiful than any vision of my dull brain.” For a few days after the arrival of the Westalls the “sands of time” were “diamond sparks” to the visitors at Eton. Charles Westall and Caroline Redwood seemed verging towards that point of happy agreement so much desired by both their parents— desired by Mr. Redwood, because his experience had taught him that virtue is the only basis of confidence or happiness, and with an inconsistency not uncommon or surprising, he preferred that virtue should be fortified by religious principle. He had preserved an affectionate recollection of Westall's father, and he fancied that he was paying him a tribute in giving to his son the noble fortune of his own child, and when his conscience whispered that the fortune was a poor compensation for the incumbrance that VOL. I. O went with it, he found some consolation in attributing Caroline's faults to the bad influence of her grandmother, and in the hope that, young as she was, her character might be remoulded. All that he had heard of Westall from the reports of others, or had gathered from occasional correspondence with him, had inspired regard for him; that regard was now becoming affection. Charles Westall's resemblance to his father recalled to him the early and happiest period of his life, that period when his heart was light and fearless, and his mind unclouded by the dark shadows that a vain and false philosophy had since cast upon it. Mr. Redwood's apprehensions that Captain Fitzgerald had taken such possession of his daughter's imagination as to endanger the success of a rival vanished when he perceived that she devoted herself with characteristic childishness to the present object. Of the happy result of her efforts to captivate Charles Westall, he had no doubt; and common experience would perhaps justify his conclusion that no young man could resist the apparent preference of a spirited young beauty with fortune enough to atone for a thousand faults. A superficial observation satisfied him that he was secure of Mrs. Westall's influence for his daughter; he perceived that the progress of time had not diminished the worldliness of disposition which his sagacity had detected even when it was sheltered by the charms of youth. Mrs. Westall was one of those ladies who are universal favourites: her face was pleasing, her person graceful, and her manners courteous; with these medium charms, she attracted attention without provoking envy; she had no strong holds in her mind for prejudice or austere principle. She was one of that large class who take their form and pressure from the society in which they happen to be cast;—a thorough conformist. In our eastern country, she was, if not strict, quite exact in her religious observances. She would have preferred the lenient bosom of episcopacy, because of its agreeable medium between the latitudinarians and the puritans, and perhaps too on account of its superior gentility. But as her location in a country town precluded the privilege of choice, she offered an edifying example, by quietly waiting on the services of a congregational meeting every Sunday, and occasionally attending a “lecture” or a “conference” during the week. She contributed to the utmost limit of her ability to the good and religious objects that engage the zeal and affections of our community. This virtuous conduct was more the effect of imitation than of independent opinion; for Mrs. Westall, with the resources of fortune, and in fashionable life, had remonstrated with some energy (she was not capable of much) against the strictness and enthusiasm of her husband. If again restored to the world, she would without an effort have conformed to its usages, and endured the excesses of genteel dissipation. In one of our cities she might have held Sunday evening levees, or in Paris have strolled out the day of “holy rest” in the public gardens, or forgotten it at the opera, or a fashionable card party. How such a woman could interest Edmund Westall, those only ought to inquire who have never observed how much early attachments are controlled by local, and (as it seems) purely accidental circumstances. Westall, during his college life, resided in the family of his wife's parents. He was captivated by the sweetness of her temper and the simplicity of her manners; he trusted for the rest with the facility of youthful love, that hopes, believes, and expects all things. He did not live long enough to awake from the lover's dream, though he occasionally saw a trait of worldliness which he imputed to the humble circumstances in which his wife had been bred, thinking that they (as they often do) had led her to an undue estimation of the advantages of wealth, rank, and fashion. Westall was deemed an enthusiast, and perhaps he was so, for his interest in the happiness of others often led him to a singular forgetfulness of himself, and his means were sometimes inadequate to effect his benevolent and philanthropic plans. Like other enthusiasts, he was apt to forget that the materials he had to work with were sordid and earthly; and, like them, he was compelled to endure the ridicule of those base spirits that were making idols of their silver and their gold, while he was on the Mount in the service of the living God. Charles Westall was four years old when he lost his parent: the recollections he preserved of him were like the “glimpse a saint has of heaven in his dreams.” He remembered being led by him to the cabins of his infirm or sick slaves, and some particulars of his humane attentions to them. He recollected the melting tenderness of his eye and the tone of his voice when he had commended him for a kind action. But his most vivid impression was of the last moment of his father's life, when he had laid his hand upon his child's head, and in the act of resigning him, had fervently prayed that he might be kept “unspotted from the world.” Charles could not then comprehend the full import of the words; but afterwards, amidst the temptations of life, he felt their efficacy. At an early period his mother had given into his possession his father's private papers. Through them he came to an intimate knowledge of his father's character—of his many virtuous efforts and sacrifices—of his hopes and fears in relation to himself—of his deepest and holiest feelings; thus the son was admitted into the sanctuary of the father's heart, and held, as it were, a spiritual communion with him. From these precious documents, Charles Westall realized all that has been hoped from the ministry of a guardian spirit; they became a kind of external conscience to him; saving him from many an error into which the buoyant careless spirit of youth might otherwise have betrayed him. Few living parents exert such an influence over the character of a child. END OF VOL. I. LONDON: SHACKELL AND ARROWSMITH, JOHNSON'S-COURT, FLEET-STREET.</field>
